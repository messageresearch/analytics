any blessing this day any of us oh god father may you take every mind captive I pray father may you have preeminence in every life Lord May every demon Spirit of unbelief and Superstition be cast out Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord may you may you your word have preeminence in every life Lord be with those who are watching as well Lord may it be like they're in the front row there Lord may your presence go to to them Lord may they not just sit casually Lord Lord on their seat but may they enter in oh god father may you grant to be with those who are sick and needy and body Lord meet every need Lord You're a supernatural God lord lord the word of man fails Lord It's vain but Lord your word is eternal it has power it is purpose Lord and I pray your word would come forth now father in Jesus Christ's name For Your Glory we ask these things Lord amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats your seats this morning so I want to take a thought if I can just just from that first scripture we read the disciple is not a Brother's Master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master now the you know we live in a in a day and oh I was just marveling just you you read this to to um read this last night um after dinner and you know the so so I want to take a subject about you know everyone one that is perfect shall be as his master and that word uh perfect uh means to be to be complete thoroughly that is to be repaired that is to be mended framed made perfectly joined together to be restored amen and we know that now we're living in a day where where Redemption is coming to its climax where people you know we are not just Sinners saved by grace amen we are not just Sinners saved by grace amen but we are the red ones of the ages I mean we're the apple of his eye I mean we're not downtrod in Christians trying to survive this this world we're Overcomers in this age amen that our Lord doesn't just want us to be under under he doesn't want us to be second class citizens in the Kingdom but the Bible says we are joint ears that means he this is us this is him he lifts us up to where he is amen that we are on level filled with him Hallelujah that's what that's what God has ordained us to be Hallelujah so I want to take um I want to take this and I want to take it in the context of Rahab uh because you know the devil wants us to shut up he wants us to quit believing he wants us to give up amen but we're not called to shut up give up or quit I mean we're called to overcome we're called to that he would the Lord would live amen we are called not to bow to the pressure of this age amen or the pressure of man but we're called to overcome Hallelujah so now it says here that the um let's go here so it says in in in Romans 8 and 23 that not only they that speaking of creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen for for the Sons and Daughters of God to be manifested amen creation is waiting amen amen for for us to take our position and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body so there's something I trust within you today amen something that's groaning you wanting you want to be clothed with immortality you're not comfortable Amen in this life and not and it's not because the world is getting bad it's because you have a Heavenly home you want to be in amen you want to see the Lord amen face to face you want to be gathered around the strong you want to worship him I mean you don't want to be limited with by this body in any way you want to be in heaven with him I trust that's that's that's the core of your heart hallelujah amen so there's waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body where our bodies are changed amen will there be a change in these atoms Hallelujah that's that's what we're waiting for and I was I I I was trembling a bit really when I was reading this last night I was thinking Lord we you know the Romans maybe no doubt thought you know well the you know the ones that Paul wrote this letter to and they took the letter and they you know read it for the first time no that they would have thought this is going to be us and in a way it will be because the dead in Christ still raised but we but but the promise was was was for today amen the Redemption of the body with there are people which are alive amen as everyone here today is everyone awake are you listening are you listening to God wants to get something to you Hallelujah we don't just want to sit casually and and let this go by am mean many people walked past Jesus when the woman had the blood issue but she knew it was more than a man walking past causing a disturbance she knew it was the son of man she knew it was the Messiah and she knew if I can just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole hallelujah how much more a service where God comes down God meets with us i' say Lord I'm going to grab I'm going to not just touch I'm going to grab your garment amen that you must change me you must make me into your image I don't want to sit still and be the same person Hallelujah I would respond to I you friends it's worth it Jesus is here right now he's here to meet your need to set the captive free Jesus is here right now but you've got to reach up and say Yes Lord I want to touch your garment you're here for mej I don't know about the person next to me but you're here for me you're here to minister to me you here to speak to me but you've got to respond amen so we living in the day of the change of the body brother B says a sweep will come over us there be a change in these atoms and before you even realize it you'll be in your glorified form Hallelujah now I don't know who said this but I think it stands quoting for anything to to go to a higher form it needs a greater one to come down and reach down and lift it up am mean you even even take the elements of this world right like lifeless dust dirt it's just there it can't become life it can't become part of life without plants absorbing it pulling it into itself and now it's part of a living being but that's just botney life it can't go any higher by itself we don't believe in evolution amen Darwin had a few ideas right but he didn't see the whole picture amen I studied Evolution at University I know what I'm talking about the laws of chemistry actually forbid it happening the laws of basic chemistry stop it happening but they're not willing to go that far because they believe they have to have faith that's right amen amen they have to have a lot of faith because it doesn't prove itself this word proves itself this word manifests what it says it is hallelujah we don't need to have we don't have Blind Faith we have real Faith Hallelujah that's right so now you take a PL that can only you know so so those elements that were in the dirt have been absorbed into the plant but it can't go any higher it takes a part of animal life like a cow comes along eats some grass now the grass becomes part of the cow it's now animal life but it can't become any higher it's now just part of the cow but then a man can come along kill the cow and eat it and now it's become part it was but it was the D dirt now it's a plant then it becomes a cow now it's part of a human but it can't go any higher by itself it needs someone greater to come down I mean the quick those atoms I mean to Chang them just from dirt to you could say Eternal dirt you're following me it takes one greater takes one greater than ourselves to reach down his hands Lift us up amen that's why when people say I've got it all sorted that's one thing you should know you don't have nothing sorted it takes him to come and sort it hallelujah hallelujah so it takes they must take one greater than man must be God that reaches down to transform that person's atoms Hallelujah I'm glad we have a message of transformation Hallelujah I made the comment on Sunday about the Old Testament as a shadow of the new which we know that is exactly right and namely that the lives of the Believers of the Old Testament are a shadow of you they point to the reality and the shadow won't produce something that's different to the reality so as I said you can have a shadow of a hand on a wall and as the hand comes closer that you don't see the shadow no more and you you know you see the hand it doesn't suddenly become a flipper or a tentacle it'll be a hand because it looks like the shadow looks like the hand right so you won't see anything that's you know it'll be the same thing but in a greater form Hallelujah so the shadow will be what it's de I mean the reality will be what the shadow is declaring now when we look into the scripture Redemption by marriage Redemption by Union amen is a principal theme of the scripture amen hallelujah amen and so I just want to take I want to take um Rahab and Salone for this context because we know that Rahab and Salomon coming together is a story of redemption now but before I go into this I've said all this because he says now but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master now in order for a disciple or a student to be become as their Master is there has to be a change in relationship right a pupil or a disciple you have the teacher the master you have the pupil they'll always be like this but there has to be a change in the relationship for them to become the same amen and we know that the only way we can become perfect as as Jesus said be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect the only way that we can become that way is that the perfect one himself comes and joins himself to you that's the only way you can become perfect amen you can have all the self-help books all you want that's just that's just like a veneer it doesn't change the core of your being it doesn't help you no but you need the perfect one to come and join himself to you that's right are you following me oh and I trust you should be able to say he already has Hallelujah he already has joined himself to me thank so just Rejoice the rest of the service and the rest of your life hallelujah amen he says be so he's saying that the that everyone that is perfect shall be as his master is it's only when the master and the disciple change relationship and they become one then the then the then the disciple will be as his master hallelujah amen who is our Master our Master is not a Bible School our Master is not me I'd say our Master is not William brandham our Master is the Lord Jesus Christ The Living Word right Jesus Christ who died on Calvary who rose again sent forth the spirit into the church he is our Master he is his word am mean we don't bow to no headquarters upon this Earth we have a headquarters in heaven amen and our chief Captain is the Lord Jesus Christ his word hallelujah that is our Master amen but it depends but who is well I could say that is my master but who is your master because the one you give your time to give service to rearrange your life that that thing takes preeminence that's your master whether it be a hobby or a job or whatever it may be sure we have to give time to work you you but if you say well no I can't do this I can't you know if your whole life what is your life revolving around I want you to think about I want God to come and speak to you amen cuz that thing is your master and that's what you shall become I want I want the Lord to be my master all other things are vain now let's go to Genesis 17 because as Jesus said be perfect um even as your father in Heaven is perfect God comes down to Abraham or Abraham and he says and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect he's telling a man you walk before me you be perfect and I'll make a covenant between me and thee and I'll M multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shall be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee so here we have God is commanding AB Abraham to walk before him and be perfect but notice now in order for this to happen God comes to him and says I will make a covenant between me and thee so now God is actually investing himself he is joining himself to Abraham that he can walk before him and be perfect are you all following me you know all the pressure is on God if you have fully given your life to him you are his responsibility he will take care of you if you cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you am mean we have to come to a place it's not you it's him right he he is the one that will look after you he is the one that will guide you he is the one who will keep you he is the one who will counsel you amen he is the one who will guide you into a Rapture he is the one who will defend you he is the one who will fight for you he is the one who will protect you he will do it it's not ourselves doing it amen but he is doing you must come to that realization I cannot fight my own battles I cannot stand on My Own Strength amen but he will stand for me hallelujah hallelujah amen that's what we're going when all to stand stand you may feel defeated but stand say Lord here I am I'm depending on you that you will keep me standing Hallelujah we have to come to that realization amen when we are gathered around the throne it will not be well yes I did a bit too Lord that's why I'm here no it'll be Lord you did it all for me you called me your goodness led me to repentance Hallelujah your goodness brought me to baptism in the name of Jesus Christ your goodness led me to surrender my entire life there's no part of me that I've kept myself your goodness filled me with your spirit amen your goodness led me to be amen into a body change hallelujah hallelujah salvation is of the Lord not of man that's why we but we have to keep that confidence Hallelujah so now here's so God says to him I'll make a covenant with thee so God is uniting himself uniting himself with Abraham but notice now now when when when this takes place God changes his name from Abraham to Abraham and we know when the when when a name is changed in the Bible it it represents a change of life they're now going to live a different life amen you see you see Abraham it means High father but now he's going to live a different kind of Life he's going to be a father of Nations and he became a father of Nations just like Sarah I don't know if we have this on here no we don't have it there but you know Sarai which means dominative is her name is changed to Sarah which is Princess amen so now she is changed her life has changed Jacob was supplanter but his name was changed after he wrestled with God to Israel Prince with God Amen because he began to live a different kind of life now you know the name Saul was good for a king but didn't do no good for an apostle for the first church a mistress whose name was changed to Paul amen because now a different life was being was being lived out amen amen and even when God changes the titles of people he's showing now I'm going to change because whenever a name is changed the relationship with God and the and the person is changing amen just like Abraham now he said God I'm going to join myself with you amen so now our relationship's changing I called you but now I'm going to become one with you by this Covenant that I am making with you hallelujah amen now brother Braham says in the in the first seal he says this he says now notice the first seal seal I'm just going to read this but but um it's really the last but I want to get to but he says notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was opened in the symbol form thundered now what about when it's opened in reality form it thundered as soon as a lamb struck back the seal what did it reveal not all of itself first it was with God next it was an assemble then it's revealed three things see it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out it was still a symbol now what he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it only is to be revealed in the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church now notice he says oh my it makes me I hope that the church truly understands it see what it means you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it the voice is of Thunder The Voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left his intercessor so he's saying no I'm not going to call you a church no more I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand what's going on why because the second part of redemption is unfolding and where it's not just a purchase but now it's a claiming work that's what this message does it's the word of God coming to claim you amen cuz you're part of that word you're part of his inheritance amen so that's why it's now I'm going to call you bride because the prophet messenger God is speaking through him saying now we're going to have a change of relationship amen amen hallelujah I'm going to call you bride now amen because we know the bride doesn't go through the tribulation there's no way that God would thoroughly purger of all their sins on Calvary and then send her through the Great Tribulation to be purged more no the blood of Jesus Christ fully purged is the bride he took our tribulation on Calvary amen we don't need any tribulation he took it on the cross he paid it all am mean he took our judgment he took our punishment amen that day on Calvary so we don't need to go through because but the church has to because she's not thoroughly cleansed because she hasn't taken the whole word of God hallelujah am that's to me I'm glad I'm not going in the tribulation amen so that's why now we are called bride that you'll understand yes sir so now as I said the disciple well as we read the disciple is not above his master and a disciple is a student now a student teacher relationship uh uh in that the teacher will always be greater in understanding than the student but the identity and the identity of the student and teacher are different right but then now when the if the relationship changes and the teacher marries the student then the student's identity is wrapped wrapped up in the teacher you following me they lose their identity Hallelujah I don't have my own identity my identity is in him the word amen hallelujah now Jesus said Jesus spoke about us being one with him he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so Jesus prayed for you I'm glad I'm glad God became flesh and prayed for me Hallelujah that they may all be one as thou father art in me and I in thee and they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I gave I have given them that they they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou and me that thou that they may be perfect and one that the world may know that thou Hast sent me and H has loved them and thou loved me father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known uh sorry and these have known that thou Hast sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love where thou Hast loved me may be in them and I am them now notice he says here that we would be they would be one even as I that they all may be one as thou father art me and I in thee so in order to be one we have to be one with the Lord that's that's he's praying that they we would become one as he because Jesus came to a place you know um well before I say that Jesus is not saying that we'd just be one big happy group Christendom would be one big happy group that's not the Oneness he's talking about he's talking about the Oneness he's talking about is that we would be one us and God would be one as he and the father were one okay are you following me amen because it's really Oneness brings the Perfection as I said it's the Union right that brings forth the Perfection amen are you all following me I hope this is not I don't believe this is mental gymnastics amen because our identity is in him right and if you're one with him everything he is we become by his grace and everything I was is lost in him amen amen so so I'm not there anymore my identities is and my husband the word hallelujah hallelujah so it's Oneness brings forth the prop ction now Jesus says here in John 10 I and my father are one then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him Jesus answered them and said many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me Jesus answered him saying for a good work I Stone thee not I mean for a good work we Stone thee not but for Blas for me and because thou being a man makest thyself God Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I have said ye are Gods if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot sorry and the scripture cannot be broken so it's when Jesus he said so for his good works the Jews didn't want to Stone him for his good works they didn't want to Stone him for Healing The Sick raising the dead feeding the multitude amen but it was when he came to a place where he said I and my father are one when you see me you've seen the father am mean that's where the Jews the religious crowd got angry because they could not handle that God would become flesh in a man and it's always it's never the it wasn't the idea of the Messiah that was offensive amen the scribes and Pharisees they would have sat round amen and said you know they would have talked about the Messiah and they would have said what he would have done and all those things so the idea was not offensive a virgin conceiving the idea of it wasn't offensive it was in the scripture but when the angel came to Mary and and when she began to testify I was walking down a narrow passageway and man about 6ot complexion shoulder you know length here spoke to me and there was a presence around him and said Mary Thou Art highly beloved among favored among women and he began to speak to me and it was words like I never heard before and and and I was troubled in there and he said Be not Afraid amen you know the story Hallelujah and and and you know he said that you'll you'll be with child and and she said how can this be I I wasn't married I never known a man and then this this angel said to me that thou shalt have a child by the Holy Ghost and he shall be the son of the highest Hallelujah and his name Shall be Called Jesus I'm just paraphrasing but I trust you all know the story right and then she began to testify about that the idea of a virgin conceiving wasn't offensive but when it put on flesh when the prophecy became flesh it was offensive and it gave her a black name you go reading his they believe it was a soldier that made her pregnant and Joseph just covered it up that's an official history why cuz the devil puts it in there to try and put a black mark against Jesus being born it wasn't a soldier it was God created amen Jesus in her womb Hallelujah Emanuel came forth but it was a but it became offensive when it put on flesh the Forerunner coming John the Baptist was not offensive in the scripture oh there's going to be a voice voice of one crying in the wilderness make the way straight for the Lord to come all the high places made Low Low Places made High Hallelujah would that be wonderful and then it put on flesh and then he be be to call a bunch of Snakes in the Grass and New Generation of Vipers and all these things it became offensive because the prophecy put on flesh Hallelujah and it's the same thing today I'm just going to Leap Forward today it's when the word puts on flesh the idea of a bride is not offensive the idea of the bride of Christ is not offensive the idea of people going in the Rapture is not offensive amen but when it puts on flesh and when you begin to say I and my father are one amen that's when it becomes offensive to people that's when they pull back that's when they say no you've gone too far no it can't just be you how dare you say this you know no doubt of Noah's day it wouldn't just be Noah saying look how bad the world's getting there would have been other people that would have been grieved but when Noah said God spoke to me oh you think you're the only Holy One I don't you know all Noah could say is I don't know about that but all I know is God spoke to me who's our judge who's our judge is man our judge or God is our judge Hallelujah and so Noah Noah said all I know is God and they begin to build the boat and it became offensive what are you doing Noah I'm building a boat where's the water it's up there no it's not yeah it is God told me it's there are you sure how could this be and okay so what happens when the this water's going to come down it's going to flood the Earth okay water that's not there is going to cover this place and people laughed but he was serious and okay so what's got but I've got a boat too no no that won't work what do you mean it doesn't work I believe like you I believe in God just like you Noah no you got to get in this one and it became offensive how dare you say this is the only one door in animals I've got to get in that it doesn't look very big it won't fit that's not my kind of sea fearing it doesn't look like it's going to sail very well all I had to do is float that's all they had to do all they had to do was survive the destruction and when it was built it became offensive that's right amen and when the word becomes manifested it becomes offensive the scribes and Pharisees could debate it all the day long but when it became flesh it became offensive amen and it's the same thing with you and I friends people talk about a bride they talk about a Rapture they talk about whatever more but when it puts on flesh and you say this is the way it's offensive because the people have to have a decision will they bow to the word or will they throw it away amen now are we still going what's happened here here we go now this seed is not able to Shook and we'll come back to what I said before now they produced that that justification will save man you believe that sure it was a carrier is it there yes it's is it there yes sure it's a carrier of the word just the same as I believe the stalk is part of the wheat but it's a carrier it ain't the life then came along sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the Bible you have to sure so that's not it so there's uh there's little more like there's two more words but then come Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there they call it the initial evidence which brought forth what the shook but they denominated but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shook pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so when you come to a place who has the holy ghost that means you and the father are one that means you have become one with God Hallelujah that's what it means if he dwells in you you can say I and my father are one hallelujah we're not two We Are One everything I am is in him my identity is in him my righteousness is in him Hallelujah all that I have my virtue anything that's good of me is because of him hallelujah amen when you come to say I my father I and the word have become one that's not too strong we have to realize who we are am I trust this anchor is real deep under the fifth rib on the left hand side Hallelujah see but you see but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength amen amen when Jesus be when the word became flesh in Jesus he wasn't just someone who argued he wasn't just someone who had an idea or a debate or some history he came manifested the promised word that he was allotted to him Hallelujah he proved who he was the life in him proved he said if you can't believe me believe the work sake for they testify of me hallelujah it's got to be the same thing with us people say how can you believe whatever whatever no if you can't believe that believe the life that's lived believe what it produces for it testifies of who we are amen hallelujah amen amen in its strength she will bring forth the ENT TI word of God in its fullness and in its strength amen that's why we are living in a day where we have been restored before the Ephesian age fell am mean where the church Rose in power am mean above all the works of the devil above all religious Spirits above all traditions of man above all culture and they Rose above all the pressure of the age and they overcame Hallelujah and we have been restored and I you have to change the we to me amen I have been restored amen back to the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints Hallelujah this now if you ever want to go listen to a service go listen to the seat is not here with the shook hallelujah amen that's very powerful now I'm going to jump back because I didn't finish here we are Jesus answered them it is not written in your law ye are Gods if he called them gods of to whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken yes sir I want to say this to you the word of God has come to you also am amen not as ideas not as information but the Living Word has come to you and you have received that word what is the scripture declaring that ye are Gods is that too strong are we part of him who is he he's the Eternal great I amen he is the Risen lamb he is God amen amen Have We Become One with him just like me and my wife were one yes Hallelujah We Are One identity amen amen we are not two people we're one see everything I am she is everything she is I am amen hallelujah I think that's glorious myself Hallelujah let you see amen everything's good in the back okay and now but the thing is now if the word is come to you I'm trying to get you to see I'm not just a whatever size you are pile of clay with life in it amen I'm part of him you're part of the Lord Jesus Christ don't let the devil rob you right now that's right amen we have to come to I yeah I trust y the the word has come to you the word came to Abraham it changed his life leave this country or go to another country what are you doing I'm packing up where you going I don't I'm following a Voice Hallelujah he followed that voice amen Moses burning bush hears the same voice on the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob it changed his life the

out his anointing oil upon him what happened the word of the Lord came to him ye shall be the king of Israel changed his life hallelujah amen and what what do they all do Express Christ down Through the Ages amen and it's easy to say oh yes them but now put it on you cuz we're still expressing Christ we're still expressing the word hallelujah hallelujah amen so we have to you have to come to that realization if the word came to them and the word calls them Gods Not Just people who happen to be stumbling along in life no part of God the scripture cannot be broken amen can everyone I trust you can stomach that who me and my Humanity yes you and your Humanity me and my failures absolutely you and your failures me and my I can't live with myself half the time yes you and you can't live with yourself half the time you know brother BR says I just want to did I put it up here I don't know if I put it up here um there's a there's a quote brother Braham says about from acts of the Holy Spirit I'll see if it's on the overhead might not be no it's not there I'll read it I'll find it first then I'll read it everyone happy Lord never ever let the devil rob you of who you are amen because you are not you say but me we have to turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus amen if we keep our eyes on who does the devil try to get you to look at you who does God want to you to look at him amen who are you looking at he says an acts of the Holy Spirit he says here as you overcome no he says he just come to me and took it out of me see see that oh sorry see the Holy Spirit then abides in and grows daily just grows making itself greater and greater pushes out the things the cares The Temptations ESP speak when God comes into you as you overcome then the Holy Spirit takes his place if you've got a real bad Temptation or something that's not right overcome the thing a few times and watch if your testimony doesn't Bloom on account of it amen so he's telling us now that just because we have the Holy Ghost doesn't mean we're free from Temptation doesn't mean we're free from trial remember Jesus was fill with the fullness of God where does he get lead to Into the Wilderness what for Temptation that's right amen the first part of his ministry when he's anointed he's taken to to be tempted amen so just because we have Temptation and things doesn't mean we don't have the Holy ghost but he says you overcome it overcome that thing a few times oh but I've already conquered it it may come round again that's why we always think the Devil comes and tries push us the door in and then we think oh we don't have it that means you do have it because now there's a push back it used to be he just walked in here I am rearrange the furniture mess up some stuff and your life walks out but then the Lord comes in the strong man comes into the house amen and he he he he brings order to our life again and then there's a then the door the devil I I don't have a door but you know he tries to push the door down but then there's resistance from the inside hallelujah amen he used to walk all through your life but now there's something in you say I hate this I want to overcome this Lord you've given me the victory so so so what the what does the Lord want you to do just overcome it a few times oh Oh you mean the devil came back again yeah it says that Jesus after he tempted in the wilderness the devil left him for a season he came back again oh we've had this dance before amen yeah you know what I mean are you with me the devil will come back and just because he comes back doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost hallelujah we're called to overcome some battles are fought a lot of times amen it's like you take the you know you take World War I everyone who loves history or war or whatever here all you boys World War I in Western Europe wasn't fought over a very big piece of ground there are lot of battles a lot of people died in very small bit of territory what happened the enemy came back they fought the enemy came back they fought the Devil comes in you fight him push him out he tries to come again push him out again here he comes back again push him again am mean and whenever the Devil comes back you should be more fortified behind the word you should have better kind of Weaponry Hallelujah you should have your full arsenal pulled out then when he comes you just machine gun him down Hallelujah drive over him whatever you want to call it and and then take his field amen hallelujah that's what we're going to do oh the devil's on my case good cuz that means you've got something he wants and if there's a resistance that means you don't want to give it Hallelujah he fights me every day brother Ben good hallelujah hallelujah that means he hasn't conquered you amen you take you take the apostles you take the apostles they fishermen do they have trouble they have trouble with the government they have trouble with the Pharisees Sadducees herodians whatever they had no trouble then Jesus be God becomes flesh says follow me then trouble happens trouble begins to happen and then the trouble really begins to happen when that same God dwells in them Hallelujah and then now they're living it's God living in them they had a lot of trouble Hallelujah why would happen because now they are raising up the devil begin to fight them because they were contending for the faith yes that's right Hallelujah got any troubles it's all right it's all good amen Growing Pains of his grace the prophet tells us amen now where are we Hallelujah just keep pressing on Friends keep fighting as brother Isaac preach fight keep fighting keep fighting Hallelujah now he says this so so when you say I and my father are one you got to come to that that place I've become made one with God because of him Hallelujah now the word of God has come to us also the word of God has come to a people that it would manifest in them and it is manifesting the promise of this age is living in a people hallelujah amen now brother BR also says and the seed is not air with the shook he says there is no I don't have this up there sorry there is no judgment to the Royal spiritual predestinated Seed of Abraham for they are predestinated unto eternal life they have accepted God's provided sacrifice and that sacrifice which is Jesus Christ the word and there is now uh there and there is therefore now no condemnation John 5:24 if you want the scripture there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Romans 81 walk not after the flesh but the spirit Romans 5:24 he that Heth my word the word there is heareth is understandeth any drunken anything else can hear it and walk away but he that heareth my word understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but is passed from Death To Life yes sir and that judgment is the great white Throne judgment so he that heareth my word God opens their understanding they understand the word they realize that they're lost and undone am mean God Saves them God transforms them amen hallelujah he that Hearth the word understands it are you following me it doesn't just pass Us by it doesn't you know some people doesn't mean nothing to but it means a lot to you why what's happening you've you've heard the word am Hallelujah he that heareth my word and Believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life not shall get it have it now amen he that hears the word and believes it believe him that me has right now present tense everlasting life and shall not go to the Judgment the white Throne judgment but as pass from Death to life amen this is a bright promise I mean them that really believe the word are you following me have everlasting life right now I have eternal life right now I'm not going to get it one day I have it right now Hallelujah I cannot go to the white Throne judgment because he took my judgment I have passed from Death to life I shall not go Hallelujah doesn't that give us Assurance amen hallelujah hallu but has passed from Death unto life yes sir that's why we're a living people we're alive in Christ we're not dead Hallelujah he that uh that this great mystery of God made known and understands how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one how that the great mysteries of of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and in the strain of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifested in the day in the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west to make himself manifested in a bright Church the word made manifest amen see it will too he that understandeth that is to know it's been revealed to him to him that sent me has everlasting life will not come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life Hallelujah I trust that means something very much to you I mean it says in the book of Galatians I I've realize I actually feel like I'm running out of time where are we there we go no there we are Galatians 3 amen because we got to you know we understand that we receive we we have received the Holy Spirit by the hearing of Faith Galatians 3 and two this would I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are you so foolished having begun in the spirit that you made now perfect In the Flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it uh if it be yet in vain he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh Mer Ires among you does he do it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith and and the Apostle Paul is telling the Galatians no you receive the Spirit by hearing um by the hearing of Faith so Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God this is how you received it you received the word you believed it I mean you received it into your life and it gave you overcoming power over this world over your own flesh I mean over the devil Hallelujah so that's why there's great so yo it's so vital that we listen to this word that we read our Bible because it gives us Faith you say well I don't know if I got anything out of it amen it will do you good amen you eat breakfast who had breakfast today who remembers what they had for dinner three nights ago good for you with the memory did it feed you yes did it give you strength yes amen you you know so it does do you good Hallelujah just eat the word brother s like a plant drinks water drinks more than it's a lot of portion and pushes out a limb so just drink and push out drink and push out Hallelujah it'll do you good well I don't understand every phrase whatever more no just drink and push out amen hallelujah so we have received amen we have received the Spirit by the hearing of Faith by the word minister we receive the spirit of God hallelujah amen amen now I will get to Rahab soon here season season second Corinthians 5:21 sorry I don't have this on the overhead for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin now remember he no one is greater than his mother Master the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master right and you become as your master when you become one with them amen so now here here is here is the Apostle Paul saying for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him hallelujah amen so he hath made him to be sin for us he became one of us right he became a fallen he he became a part of Adam's amen he became Flesh and Blood like us he was made our sin offering that's why you got to look at your identity that's why you know the word will stand for itself the Apostle Paul after he met the Lord on the road to Damascus he didn't go to Gan try and explain it right he didn't go to the Bible School say look I'll explain this explain this no he followed the pillar of fire he didn't go you know Jesus he just said he said a lot of things he didn't explain them amen the apostle Paul he referenced some things from the Old Testament other things he just said right there wasn't apologetics to that followed his ministry true amen the predestinate had received it it manifested the word in their lives and they moved on you know they just walked on with God that's it true amen so our identity I I I just thought to drop that in there but see he became sin for us now we believe that do we not that's why we're here I trust amen who knew no sin he became our sin offering who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so we are as righteous I heard brother Harold h hilderbrand say this at a convention 2009 when it was but he said at the end of the service he said now I can say this I'm as righteous as God is righteous I'm as sinless as God is sinless I'm as pure as God is pure really what what did did you understand what I just read it's in the Bible if you believe the Lord you believe the Bible right if you really believe it then you believe that you actually take him at his word he became me that I would become the very righteous of God in him Hallelujah that means I'm as pure as God is pure I'm as holy as God is Holy I'm as righteous as he is righteous that's right you say well me and my Humanity yeah Hallelujah that's why the devil says that's why when the devil came to Jesus if thou be he didn't know he wasn't sure how could this can this little man be Emmanuel he was and then he comes down looks at you and says no these people no I don't believe it he doesn't believe really he says he believes he doesn't really believe it's not revealed to him this has intellectual Faith Like A lot of people unfortunately he doesn't have a revealed Faith otherwise he'd be one of us hallelujah and so he looks at you he says no you can't be and then he tries to take his opinion and then he tries to give it to you what's the doubt where's the doubt come from it's not from God it's not from God it's from Satan because he's trying to get his opinion and try and get you to agree with what he thinks of you okay number one why would you listen to your enemy let's just be real just just real real real honest he hates me here's here's this thing that wants to destroy my life why am I going to say oh you're so right I always thought why would you listen to him come on I know this is very I'm not trying to make a joke of it but you know why do you listen to him and then you know how the devil actually tries to convey his thoughts he puts on flesh he comes to you says no you're not it you you gone down some funny Road you're in a cult you're in a manf following crazy religion are you going to listen to that he said no no that may be your experience but my experience is I met the the Lord Jesus Christ I am not caught up with the man William brandom I'm not I don't have a b Buckle that I wear I don't go hunting because he did I don't go fishing because he did I don't wear a whatever hat because he did I don't drive a Ford because he I don't have a Ford but you know what I mean I I haven't become I got to become like him ha and fetch and whatever tot and you know take on his Humanity we're not called to take on the spirit of a man I trust it's the same thing with us we're called to take on the spirit of God Hallelujah so I'm not caught up with the messenger I'm caught up alasa pointed out Isaac and as soon as Rebecca saw Isaac thank you here I come Hallelujah isn't it that way Hallelujah the chief Reaper the chief Reaper says to boa Bo says who's this damsel Chief Reaper says that's that's Ruth of Moab he's out of the picture he doesn't matter no more amen it's

said they got caught up in jesus' Veil too Hallelujah anyway now so if we have be if he became me and he did then I become him because remember this is not just something Universal and everyone's a sinless is here sinless no this is for his bride his elected ones amen amen that he has become alive and real too has he become alive to you I wouldn't say no I'd say yes you have a confidence he met me he met me there he met me at the camp he met me in my kitchen he met me driving along he met me in church he came to me when I couldn't go just like how I said about Adams and it takes a greater one to reach down he met me there Hallelujah and don't let the devil move you whatever you do no that happened you say and the devil says now that didn't really happen you're going to say hold on I was there what do you mean it didn't happen I was there he spoke to me all you have is a secondhand lie no I was there when it happened hallelujah amen now says here so he became me that I'd become him by his grace hallelujah hallelujah now he says again and seed is not a with the sh notice that in the Pentecostal age through the Lutheran age through the Wesleyan age it's the same thing through this Pentecostal age now notice at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicating by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth he overcame all things there was a full strength amen hallelujah the full strength of the word he overcame hell death in the grave and now we are living in an age where the full strength of the word has come hey hallelujah we're not under a partial light but the Harvest light is shining the full light of the word is here the full strength of the Gospel I mean we

every more God comes down I trust it's attracted your attention it's awoken you up oh Lord You're Here Lord You're Alive Lord you're here to meet me hallelujah hallelujah we're at the last days the shook uh will give forth its strength into the seed it's went out on it it's went on out it was a good chook it served its time see but it is the word Bride of the word groom Hallelujah that is now the time it's a word Bride of the word groom so as he is the word you are the word like marries like it's illegal for me to go marry a cat and even if I could you know you can't make cat human hybrid babies okay that doesn't work like Mary's like let what did God say in the beginning let everything bring forth after its own kind right so if God is going to have people upon the Earth what kind of people will they be they will be Godlike people they will be God people hallelujah just like all those you have children you look down even when the children are yay big and maybe a few minutes old you can look into them and say they look just like me and then you begin to find out whether you like it or not the characteristics of you and them and you see it's like you're looking in a mirror Allelujah good and bad and when God God has no bad characteristics in him so when he when he he brings forth children upon the earth when he brings forth his bride and he looks down at her he sees himself Hallelujah he sees himself in a people why because like marries like to bring forth like Hallelujah yes what who me yes you are you following me we got to listen just take this guy and his impact on your life put it to one side amen because we get so wrapped up in this thing this thing's going to be changed one day amen we shouldn't focus on this thing focus on him and this thing will be taken care of hallelujah amen I believe it he will take care of it amen so now like Mary's like so the word bride if if the groom is the word so the bride is the word now let's go very quickly to Rahab how does this have to do with Rahab Rahab was locked up in Jericho amen I'm just going to go real quickly through the story of Rahab because I've said all that just to come to Rahab Rahab was locked up in Jericho she was not part of the promise of God at all she was an enemy alien in the she was a squatter in the promised land right We Were Once Upon a Time the enemies of God Amen we were doesn't matter what family you're from you can trace your lineage back to Adam who cares you're still born born in sin shaped in iniquity come to World speaking lies okay so we're all born lost we need him to save us amen so Jer so Rahab was locked up in Jericho amen Jericho itself was sealed up and once upon part time we were locked up amen our first birth locked us up amen and and and that either manifested in religion denominational tombs of man's ideas or the world fulfilling the lust of the flesh but we're all sealed up in a in a city amen now but this is not what God had for us it says in Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now the Instagram version of that scripture is you know God just thinks nice thoughts thinking of you today and you not yeah I like you you know it's it's it's diluted down but the the real version of that scripture is far more powerful than just thinking nice thoughts because God doesn't have a new thought right God's thoughts have been declared he doesn't have a new thought Amen to what he thought about you before the foundation of the world right he cannot change his thinking he's made up his mind amen he's made up his mind he cannot deviate from how he thought about you doesn't matter about what we conceive or think we are it doesn't change his thinking amen because God's thoughts are not like man's thoughts man's thoughts change mine change a lot amen kids come to me can we do this well maybe you know cuz and that's probably very frustrating but God's thoughts I'm glad God is not like that right God's thoughts are already been made up he cannot change them amen he doesn't change his thoughts he cannot have a new thought what he has thought and declared it is so and shall ever be amen and we know that his thoughts are his word hallelujah so now so when he says that I have thoughts towards you says the Lord thoughts of Peace not eval to give you an expected end those thoughts towards you are what he's ordained you to become what he's ordained you to be amen that now so his thoughts towards us amen is that we would be made in His image we would become one with him am mean everything he is we become by his grace amen so his righteousness we become as righteous as he is as holy as he is as virtuous as he is as sinless as he is hallelujah amen we're Made In His Image we're joined to him that his sort that in 2000 and whenever you met the Lord Place a year there just say 2019 if it's this year or 2018 in 2007 he thought about me I well in two in 1985 men will be born upon the Earth he won't know me amen but in 2007 but I'll begin to brood over his life and I'll lead him down a path cuz he's got a thought towards me and that's been gathered around his throne redeemed that's his thought now he's like now I'm going to get them there so he has a predestinated path so 1985 I'll be born he won't know me he won't know where he came from but there'll come a time and I'll brw over him and in his heart I'll make it that he always wanted me maybe not really knowing where are you who was like that Hallelujah there's a longing and then then I'll brw over him but then in 2007 in September I'm going to meet him I'm going to reveal himself I'm going to reveal myself to him and God has ordained everything then finally I come down to that moment I meet the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then I begin to see I'm not just from New Zealand and from Heaven Hallelujah that doesn't matter what happens in life he's in control he's brought me here and if he's brought me here he'll take me away from here hallelujah that's why he's here hallelujah that's his thought towards us his thought towards us is not based on how we are acting you know I may think nice things towards you because You' be nice to me that's human thought that's human thought oh brother kabin isn't he wonderful and he is wonderful amen but then no I can't even put this cuz brother K wouldn't do anything bad but you know but then what if us like oh brother then my thoughts are not so good because it's human thoughts but God's thoughts are not but that's based on what he does to me that's human thinking right but God's thinking doesn't change while we we were yet sinners he died and loved us while we we were his enemy he died for us hallelujah amen because he he had thoughts towards us that of peace that we had come to an expected end Hallelujah that expected end is redeemed around his throne hallelujah amen that's his s that's what we need to focus on Lord what do you think about me what have you declared about me in your word and focus upon that not what people think amen not what people think what does God say here is here is Mary coming into the temple and Joseph with Jesus 8 days old to be dedicated whatever age he was all the other woman were bringing their woman uh children in there was a gap as here was a woman who was of ill Fame had a black name you the Jesus M you know God sorry the devil makes sure that the word has a bad name he he makes real sure he you know he's very good at marketing he make sure that the word has a bad name but the you know you know the Apostle Paul comes to some Jews in the city in the book of Acts go find it there's some more homework for you and and and and they ask him what about the sect of Jesus of Nazareth everywhere spoken evil against what's happening the devil's marketing already before it even got there oh and God you know the devil doesn't change and so Here Comes Mary and here's these woman with their babies coming for the baby to be dedicated or whatever they did and there's now they're keeping away because I want to be identified with her that's man's thoughts towards Jesus that's the devil's thoughts towards Jesus But Here Comes Simeon Here Comes God's thoughts God's thoughts come down Simeon picks up the child now I can depart in peace mine eyes have seen thy salvation Hallelujah and then blind Anna comes in she saw way more than those people she comes and a prophetess comes in picks up the child Hallelujah that was God's slot Hallelujah being manifested hallelujah what does God think towards you focus on that amen now he was RAB her expected him wasn't to die with those people in the city her expected end is that she would become into into the lineage of Jesus Christ Hallelujah she was ordained to be part of that lineage now but she was living in a time where Israel was coming in to possess its Promised Land as it was promised to their forefathers the land was promised to Abraham but he didn't possess it he just walked upon it then it had to become 400 odd years later or however long it was and then finally fin only Israel possessed the promise and much like today you read many scriptures the Apostle Paul Peter are writing promises you know prophecies but they weren't for that day they for this day Hallelujah that you know that the forefathers didn't possess it they just walked out upon it then there comes a generation at the end that will possess the fullness of the promise Hallelujah and that is that is the people we are amen so that and then so there she so now so so just as Rahab was living there and Israel was coming in to receive its inher so we are living in a time where a bride is coming back to her Homeland her possession the word of God hallelujah amen and then now rahab's there the oncoming destruction she hears about the oncoming destruction but something in her said there must be Mercy in this destruction there was a death sentence on on Jericho but something in her said there must be Mercy For Me amen it's the same thing we see this world is falling apart we see there will be an Armageddon but there's something in heart I trust it cried out when you heard the world world is falling apart when you heard that this world is going to be destroyed something and you said there must be Mercy For Me Lord there must be a way there must be Mercy for me make a way for me Lord hallelujah and she received a token she found she found Mercy thank you Lord she applied that token God came and destroyed the place where she was locked up and she was free and it's the same thing with us God destroyed our Jericho Hallelujah you're bouncing around hey we were all oh but I did no we were all bouncing around in a little Jericho box and our our little manmade this is what we do but God didn't want us to be that way he want us to walk free am mean that we would come into our possession Hallelujah but then now so God came and destroyed the place it really got destroyed brother bam says this in Hebrews chapter 6 and I'll try and wind this up he says and how so he's speaking about the blood and how can I then as after Christ has died for me and I became his righteousness because of his grace and love to me how can I sin when there's something laying between me and God a sacrifice I can't sin I can't do it God never sees me he sees Christ he stands in my place and when I do anything wrong Christ takes my place I've made my confession I'm wrong he's right Lord you know my heart you know whether I mean it or not I'm wrong forgive me God sees it the blood of Jesus has got me covered all the time I like those words all the time I mean how can God ever see me how can sin be counted to me when he can't do it just as soon as I do it it's forgiven that's right it's like taking a little dropper like this little eye dropper full of black ink hold it over a tub of bleach and it just drops in there and then try to find it again it turns to the bleach the ink becomes bleach that's what you do what you'll confess sin if you're in Christ between you and God is a whole tub of bleach and your sins become righteous because of righteous sacrifices waiting there for you Hallelujah am amen isn't that wonderful now but the thing is now Rahab Rahab was now living in a place she's an alien she's not part of the Commonwealth of God and now she's living in a place where Israel has taken over and we know that the and so now here comes thee but God doesn't finish with her because God wants her to know that she has a right to dwell there Hallelujah friends you have a right to dwell in the word of God you have a right you have a right and but it's by Union with Christ with Jesus Christ's word you have a right for every to every Divine promise now anyone like Rahab no one has a right to object to you being United with Christ as she was with Solomon no doubt there were many women who would have been a better wife maybe amen two Salone they were Jewish woman all kinds of things you're the right kind of woman but here was a gentile who was a harlot and now salmon was looking for the right woman remember like Mar's like Hallelujah God saw something in you even when you may never have seen it God saw something in you place something in you before the foundation of the world and here comes Salomon and and and he goes to marry Rahab and maybe there was a lot of fussing going along in Israel how D this you know Rahab say that you know I can't stand I should have married him he followed me and then maybe well maybe in those days I don't know how they did it but does anyone object to this Union speak now forever hold your peace I can't I'm going to stand up so just maybe some woman stands up she was a harlot she lived this kind of life and may be listed out all her sins and salmon remember it's God's choosing man's choosing said Okay if that is the case find the ones the men that she was a harlot worth you hear a pin drop why because they're dead her past has been annihilated amen her past has been destroyed there's no living evidence it's all gone hallelujah it's all gone and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does for us amen our past is eradicated it's not just covered over it's not just swept under a rug it's been annihilated in the blood of Jesus Christ am mean that the evidence is done away with blessed be the Lord hallelujah and then and then so well now everyone has to shut up and they have a right to get married Hallelujah and they get married and what she was just by saying I do have you said I do to Jesus Jesus say Lord take my life make it thine I do Hallelujah what's happened now you were once whoever you were place your name here remember name represents a life and you become one with him he was Rahab the Harlot of Jericho but then she became Rahab of the tribe of Judah hallelujah hallelujah of mared of Salomon Hallelujah and not just that now she's living in Bethlehem the house of God's bread Hallelujah the house of God bread so now her old identity by saying I do it's eradicated Hallelujah because Salon being a general took care of it took care of her past Hallelujah and then now someone comes along maybe someone's traveling because she would have looked different to everyone else in Israel I don't think she'd looked Jewish to me she wasn't she's a gentile then maybe they're walking up to Bethlehem you know and they see this woman she's a gentile say what are you doing living here you know people come to you what are you doing the Devil Comes what right do you say you claim that you're the bride what right do you have to say it you know how dare you say that you're a Believer how dare you even say you're a Christian what's happening they're trying to push you off your inheritance and she could just do this I show the ring hallelujah how are you welcome I live here how dare you say you live here no I have a right cuz I'm married who's your husband that one oh oh sir Salon Hallelujah now their attitude change but if she was not sure in her relationship then maybe she'd be a bit pushed back by the these people no no I live here this place is made for me I'm wearing his wedding ring he gave it to me he gave it to me amen it's just like us brother says in the invisible Union I'm I can't get it quite word for word but we were born with a wedding band of unmar predestinated Grace on our fingers Hallelujah we didn't suddenly get it one day we always had it and then and then God comes down where's my woman where's my bride Hallelujah where is she and he's walking through seven Church ages Gathering her up Gathering her up Hallelujah making her fall in love with him Hallelujah find you know that's like brother says like Romeo and Juliet Romeo comes in the middle of the night gets Juliet out they run off Jesus is going to come like a thief in the night you know I trust you know we're going to be I'm thinking about the Rapture quite a lot you know and there's something in us what me I don't know I yeah I think I'm going to be lost for words but I trust when we see the dead in Christ arise we go to meet the Lord in the air we just say we've been expecting you hallelujah hallelujah we've been waiting we've been watching we've been waiting here we are I've been expecting this Hallelujah this is the moment I've been waiting for all my life Hallelujah and it's going to happen one day day and it's going to happen one day Hallelujah I trust to be we've been I've been waiting for you you're right on time Hallelujah I got a bit trouble I got worried but I know you're right on time Jesus is never late he's always right on time Hallelujah but now she just had to say um no I'm married to Salomon I have a right to live and Bethlehem and we have a right that's why the devil what does he attack you really a Believer you think you're one of them this is all some hashed up thing out of Kentucky or wherever just some conspiracy theory no no no no no no I didn't meet William brandham I did not meet him I met Jesus Christ this word this word stepped out of History amen he stepped out of History to me I didn't change me he changed me he transformed me even against my own self I had to come to a place where said Lord I give up amen I had no human pressure to become a Believer I had no church pressuring me I had no one saying come on just well you know come on you can do it just do no no no it was him and me amen and I know it's the same I know it's him I know it's the original Faith because it produces the word and there's a spirit in me cannot deny this word hallelujah hallelujah nothing can explain this word away amen well how do you know it's it it's the author of the book amen because the author will never deny his own work amen hallelujah will never diminish it never explain it away it always be in its full strength amenu now the reason I say this is because it says in Isaiah 54 let's just go there I'm going to read verses 16 and 17 I'm sorry this is not on the not on there Isaiah 54 vers 16 and 17 I need to work out how to use the new software I'm waiting for everyone so say Amen when you are there am there we go good now behold see the reason I want to read this the reason the whole because we have to have Supreme confidence now keep turning I want everyone to be he there Isaiah 54 so so the reason I'm I'm saying these things is we have to have Supreme confidence in our Lord Jesus amen that's why I want to I want to lift them up a little bit higher I mean that you'd admire him more you'd love him more you'd appreciate him more for what he's done to you not just what he's done in history what he's done to you what he's done for you am mean that our identity is not in ourselves it's in him Hallelujah because we have to come to a place now Isaiah 54 and6 and 17 because the enemy comes against us right he comes against you he tries to make he tries to dechristianize you amen many times it's him trying to get you to think you're not a Believer but then he'll anoint other people to say you're not a Christian you're not even part of the accepted School of churches well neither was the book of Acts church either that's right by the way Isaiah 54:16 behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have cre created the wasted to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise up against thee in judgment shall thou condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayith the Lord hallelujah so no weapon amen put this on your fridge if you you if you got room no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper this is God speaking to you no weapon weapon the devil has a lot of weapons but no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment Thou shalt condemn why could why could Rahab condemn every tongue that raised against her in judgment should say one where's my pass gone it's gone it's dead it's buried it's history Hallelujah the blood eradicates how pass I mean so nothing about pass can be held against us and then twoo when people come along and say what are you living in here Bethlehem go why are you living in bethleem Rahab you don't even belong here should say Yes I Do by a union hallah by my marriage to Salmon I have a god-given right to live in this place Hallelujah and that's why you've got to look when when the enemy comes against you says you're not a Believer you're not a Christian whatever whatever you say now hold on hold on I have a god-given right Amen to call myself a Believer because I am United with my Lord Jesus he has United himself to me Hallelujah I have a god-given to live in the word of God as my possession don't let the devil ever kick you out of your inheritance amen if it's Joy being robbed of Peace whatever it is kick them out am amen don't be two- minded just be one minded the Lord United himself to me it was his choosing I just said yes and here I am hallelujah amen amen you got to every time and we know that the tongues that rise against us in judgment that's the devil trying to get you I just say Satan you've lost the battle amen I'm free am amen amen every everyone that is perfect shall be as his maker he has made us perfect the sin question is settled is it settled in your mind is it settled in your heart your sin your sin question has it been settled in your heart amen if it's been settled in your heart well what what are you asking has it been settled in your heart that he paid it all for you amen that he has redeemed you that he's coming back to carry you away has it been settled because that's what the devil always tries to push that back oh did he really did he really and we're looking at this Humanity if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen if we walk in the light as he is in the light that's us and God Amen then the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin 1 John 1:7 amen if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us are we walking in light the revealed truth of the hour the answer is yes amen then we're walking with him then the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all Al El sin the sin question settled friends and if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen we have the musicians please I run out of time but has it been settled you say well I fail every day get back up every day say Lord pick me up try me one more time am I read that quote from The Acts of the Holy Spirit Devil Comes you know that Temptation will come a you know just just defeat that Temptation a few times then you'll watch your testimony Bloom out amen the devil will come against you of course he will he's determined but God is way more determined amen hallelujah let's stand shall we let's sing that where's where's brother Jeremy on he's getting plugged in amen I want to sing that song Psalm 34 song again am mean do you love the Lord
