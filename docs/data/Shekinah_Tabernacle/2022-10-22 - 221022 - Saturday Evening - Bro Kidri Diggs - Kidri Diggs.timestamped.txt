[9:27] welcome back to the house of God this
[9:29] evening hey man it's good to be here
[9:31] it's good to be in an atmosphere where
[9:33] our lives can be changed for the better
[9:35] and I believe my trust you've had a good
[9:38] time so far and I believe the Lord is
[9:40] going to continue to bless us
[9:42] because that's what he's in the business
[9:43] of doing if we surrender to Him He
[9:46] blesses us amen so let's um let's stand
[9:50] um tonight
[9:52] and
[9:54] the blessing that I have for you that
[9:58] the Lord has for you this evening
[10:01] is fitting because this morning's
[10:03] message was about wild beasts and and
[10:06] bear hunting season
[10:09] and also we had the um the Hebrew song
[10:13] because we are we have we have been
[10:15] grafted into the promises and that's how
[10:17] we can the promises that God gave to
[10:19] Israel and that's how we as Gentiles can
[10:21] can
[10:22] can read the scriptures that were not
[10:24] necessarily given to us
[10:26] but yeah we're grafted in so we claim
[10:28] them
[10:29] you know that's what it all comes down
[10:30] to is if you want it it's yours
[10:35] there's a song that says when the
[10:37] trumpet of the Lord shall sound in time
[10:38] shall be no more in the morning breaks
[10:40] Eternal bright and fear when the saved
[10:42] of Earth Shall Gather over on the other
[10:44] Shore and the role is Called Up Yonder
[10:46] I'll be there
[10:48] yeah
[10:49] now I I ask about the songwriter that
[10:52] wrote that song why will he be there
[10:54] you know and to keep it really simple
[10:56] it's just because he said he'll be there
[10:58] I'll be there
[11:02] that's what it comes down to I'll be
[11:03] there I'm gonna be there you know we we
[11:06] disclaim it I'll be there and you will
[11:08] be there
[11:10] if you say well I won't be there I don't
[11:11] want to go then you don't have a chance
[11:13] of going but if you say look yes I like
[11:15] that I'll be there I'm I'm going you
[11:17] know the the violent take it by force
[11:19] this is Satan wants us to say we can't
[11:22] but God just wants us to believe we can
[11:24] that's why brother branham's theme song
[11:27] was only believe
[11:29] all things are possible
[11:31] don't have any doubt just believe don't
[11:34] look back look forward and believe for
[11:36] everything for all things amen
[11:39] so the scripture is from Leviticus
[11:42] now this is talking about land but you
[11:44] can you can type it to your life in
[11:45] whichever way you'd like because we're
[11:46] like land and we're like that and it
[11:49] says then I will give you rain and due
[11:51] season
[11:53] and the land shall yield her increase
[11:57] and the Trees of the field shall yield
[12:00] their fruit
[12:02] and your threshing floor shall reach
[12:05] unto the Vintage
[12:06] [Music]
[12:08] and the Vintage shall reach unto the
[12:10] sowing time
[12:11] and ye shall eat your bread to the full
[12:14] and dwell in your land safely
[12:18] and I will give you peace in the land
[12:22] and you shall lie down and none shall
[12:25] make you afraid
[12:27] and I will rid evil beasts out of the
[12:30] land
[12:32] neither shall the sword go through your
[12:34] land
[12:35] and ye shall Chase your enemies and they

[58:00] Matthew the 14th chapter
[58:03] Matthew 14.
[58:17] How great is our God
[58:20] Matthew chapter 14.
[58:41] let's start reading we're going to make
[58:42] the reading so let's start reading that
[58:43] verse um
[58:48] let's start at verse 26.
[58:54] thank you
[58:58] and when the disciples saw him walking
[59:00] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[59:03] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[59:06] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[59:09] saying be of good cheer it is I
[59:13] Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and
[59:17] said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto
[59:21] thee on the water and he said come and
[59:24] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[59:27] he walked on the water
[59:30] to go to Jesus but when he saw the winds
[59:34] boisterous he was afraid and began to
[59:37] sink and begin to sink and he cried
[59:40] saying Lord save me and immediately
[59:42] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[59:45] called him and said unto him o thou of
[59:47] little faith wherefore then is thou
[59:50] doubt
[59:51] amen
[59:53] may the Lord bless you reading of his
[59:55] word you can have your seats
[59:58] you know as you're sitting let's turn to
[1:00:00] Corinthians chapter 10 right quick
[1:00:02] Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:00:06] second Corinthians chapter 10
[1:00:15] second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[1:00:17] 4.
[1:00:21] second Corinthians 10 and 4 the Bible
[1:00:23] says for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:00:25] not carnal But Mighty through
[1:00:28] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:00:31] casting down imaginations and everything
[1:00:34] that exalt itself against the knowledge
[1:00:37] of God and bringing into captivity every
[1:00:41] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:47] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:00:49] carnal amen but those weapons are
[1:00:53] powerful enough to pull down strongholds
[1:00:57] Hallelujah that's what God has given us
[1:01:00] amen by the by the grace of God tonight
[1:01:02] I want to use for a subject because I I
[1:01:05] truly believe that the path I ought to
[1:01:08] take tonight has already been Vindicated
[1:01:10] by Brother Chris's message
[1:01:13] and you know for us to be uh uh bear
[1:01:16] hunters
[1:01:18] for us to be lion hunters for us to be
[1:01:22] giant killers that's something God got
[1:01:24] to do with us first
[1:01:26] and what God has to do he has to take
[1:01:28] away the fear out of the church
[1:01:31] you know my subject tonight is when
[1:01:33] there is no fear Hallelujah who are we
[1:01:36] when there is no fear
[1:01:38] young people adults family members what
[1:01:42] are we when there's no fear as a
[1:01:45] Believer as a Son of God or daughter of
[1:01:47] God think about that for a moment you
[1:01:51] know and and that's brother Chris I told
[1:01:52] him I might keep mentioning his name so
[1:01:54] don't worry about it amen but as he was
[1:01:57] preaching you know
[1:01:58] um
[1:01:59] the different things that he brought out
[1:02:01] was so powerful you know to even think
[1:02:04] about you can hunt a bear there has to
[1:02:07] be no fear
[1:02:08] because just the presence of a bear
[1:02:11] knowing you're just a human brings forth
[1:02:14] some fear
[1:02:15] so in order for you to get to God
[1:02:17] hallelujah
[1:02:18] leave your house go into the woods and
[1:02:22] go into the badge territory fear has to
[1:02:25] be gone
[1:02:26] Amen in order for you to put the gun in
[1:02:29] your hand fear has to be gone in order
[1:02:32] for you to pull the trigger fear has to
[1:02:35] be gone so Church how much think about
[1:02:38] what you can accomplish when there is no
[1:02:41] fear
[1:02:42] Hallelujah think about what can happen
[1:02:45] in this church tonight Hallelujah if
[1:02:47] there was no fear
[1:02:49] if you Hallelujah if you wasn't afraid
[1:02:52] of who was looking at you if you weren't
[1:02:54] afraid of what you did last week or
[1:02:57] feels or that think about the church if
[1:03:00] this was a pure atmosphere of Faith what
[1:03:03] could happen in this place
[1:03:06] Hallelujah
[1:03:08] but you know Church fear is something
[1:03:11] that the devil has perverted
[1:03:14] Hallelujah fear what is it it's the
[1:03:17] perversion of faith
[1:03:19] Hallelujah and the prophet of God said
[1:03:21] that there's two things you can live by
[1:03:24] only two
[1:03:26] not a maybe not it should be not a might
[1:03:30] be it's only Faith or faith
[1:03:33] now where are you tonight are you living
[1:03:36] by faith or fear because there's only
[1:03:39] two things controlling you right now
[1:03:42] Hallelujah even in the service you're
[1:03:45] being controlled by faith or you're
[1:03:47] being controlled by fear
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] but I want to make it real plain
[1:03:53] what if
[1:03:55] there was no fear in here
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:04:06] you know
[1:04:08] I've been um
[1:04:10] I've been criticized for exciting the
[1:04:13] people
[1:04:13] [Laughter]
[1:04:16] but I'm all right with that
[1:04:18] because God's been good to me
[1:04:21] Hallelujah
[1:04:22] God's been good to me
[1:04:25] God heal me he saved me he redeemed me
[1:04:29] God has taken away my fear
[1:04:32] hey I'm not afraid to serve God I'm not
[1:04:36] afraid to worship God
[1:04:38] of Faith to give him praise Hallelujah I
[1:04:42] don't care what somebody thinks I know
[1:04:44] what he's done for me
[1:04:47] honey I don't worship Him in in fear of
[1:04:51] what somebody may think
[1:04:53] Hallelujah
[1:04:54] you know and let me say this for the for
[1:04:57] the critics no I'm not trying to excite
[1:04:59] the people
[1:05:01] and and to make it even more clearer
[1:05:03] it's not the person that excites the
[1:05:05] people it's the word
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:10] if you know the word hallelujah amen and
[1:05:14] it stimulates you the prophet of God
[1:05:16] said is stimulation by Revelation it's
[1:05:19] the Revelation that excites the people
[1:05:23] oh
[1:05:28] let's look at it Church Hallelujah
[1:05:31] when there is no fear amen you know I'm
[1:05:34] gonna read you some quotes and some
[1:05:35] different things that the prophet of God
[1:05:37] said but I want you to catch it amen
[1:05:41] is hallelujah bear season
[1:05:44] Hallelujah
[1:05:48] I'm the Hallelujah to go out and take
[1:05:52] back those things that the enemy has
[1:05:54] taken from you
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:59] Hallelujah but how did man look earlier
[1:06:03] when there was no fear
[1:06:06] how did he act when there was no fear
[1:06:09] and we are the greatest example of that
[1:06:11] in the scripture
[1:06:13] let's go back to the Book of Genesis
[1:06:15] amen and let's look at how Adam
[1:06:17] conducted himself before fear came in
[1:06:20] his life
[1:06:21] look at who he was before fear came to
[1:06:24] this life look at how he talked look at
[1:06:26] how he walked look at the things he
[1:06:28] could do before fear came in his life
[1:06:32] Hallelujah before fear came in his life
[1:06:35] Adam could talk to creation and it would
[1:06:37] obey
[1:06:39] for fear came in his life he could speak
[1:06:42] to all the animals and not be afraid
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:49] we know the prophet of God's head
[1:06:51] Advocates speak to the water the river
[1:06:53] telling the flow a different direction
[1:06:55] and it would do it
[1:06:59] y'all don't believe that
[1:07:01] well if you don't that's what a God is
[1:07:03] capable of
[1:07:06] when you are a God everything around you
[1:07:10] is subject to who you are
[1:07:12] and Adam was created in the likeness and
[1:07:16] image of God
[1:07:18] so everything around him was afraid of
[1:07:21] him
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:30] everything around him was obedient to
[1:07:33] evil
[1:07:34] why because he had the person the nature
[1:07:37] the likeness the image of God
[1:07:40] because there was no fear in his life
[1:07:46] I hope you're seeing yourself now
[1:07:48] that's what the word does the word comes
[1:07:51] to remind you of Who You Are
[1:07:54] that's what this message is all about
[1:07:57] it's trying to take the fear out of the
[1:07:59] church
[1:08:04] Hallelujah
[1:08:06] one of you young people hallelujah would
[1:08:08] not be afraid in school anymore
[1:08:12] and you walk in the authority that God
[1:08:15] has given you
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:20] you know when something
[1:08:23] God it commands respect
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:29] and if you could Hallelujah realize who
[1:08:32] you are
[1:08:33] if you could get back to that place that
[1:08:35] Adam was created in how that Adam was
[1:08:38] created like Hallelujah you would
[1:08:41] command respect
[1:08:44] when you walk in the school room
[1:08:46] Hallelujah your person will command
[1:08:49] respect when you go to the job it would
[1:08:52] command respect
[1:08:55] because you're in the image in the
[1:08:57] likeness of God and you're walking
[1:08:59] without fear
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:05] look
[1:09:08] most most babies
[1:09:10] little babies they don't have fear
[1:09:15] foreign
[1:09:16] and God has said to us we got to come to
[1:09:19] him like what the
[1:09:21] CH like a baby because a baby doesn't
[1:09:23] have a fear it doesn't know what fear is
[1:09:26] until something happens Hallelujah you
[1:09:30] can say don't touch that stone and
[1:09:31] they'll be right there for you to touch
[1:09:33] it it could be blazing hot and you say
[1:09:35] don't touch it don't touch it but
[1:09:37] they're gonna touch it anyway
[1:09:39] you know why they're gonna touch it
[1:09:40] because before they touch it they didn't
[1:09:42] have any fear
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:47] and there's some things that you've
[1:09:49] touched and It produced a fear in your
[1:09:51] life and you're still walking with that
[1:09:54] fear
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:57] but I'm gonna drop something heavy on
[1:09:59] your church earlier and remember the
[1:10:01] prophet of God talked about a sister in
[1:10:04] the house cooking something at least you
[1:10:06] let's just say it was cheeky
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:11] Hallelujah let's just say she was fried
[1:10:14] chicken honey and he said the grease
[1:10:16] popped on a Hallelujah and she began to
[1:10:19] say ah he said it wasn't the grease that
[1:10:21] was hot
[1:10:23] he said was it the grease that burned
[1:10:25] the Hallelujah he said it was fear that
[1:10:27] made it react like that
[1:10:30] so
[1:10:31] come on
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:34] I'll give you another example Harley
[1:10:36] there are people and some of you may
[1:10:38] have heard this there are people
[1:10:40] hallelujah who've gotten shot and didn't
[1:10:42] even realize they were shot right
[1:10:46] why because the adrenaline kept them
[1:10:48] going and it wasn't until they settled
[1:10:50] down and the biggest thing they saw the
[1:10:52] blood
[1:10:53] when they saw the blood
[1:10:56] but before they saw anything with their
[1:10:59] eyes they were all right hallelujah amen
[1:11:03] fear was always dead but it took
[1:11:05] something to give it a reaction
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:09] and Satan's no good Hallelujah until you
[1:11:12] give him a reaction
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:19] that particular quote blows me away
[1:11:22] because I'm sure most of us have been
[1:11:24] burnt before
[1:11:26] but he said it wasn't the Greece
[1:11:28] hallelujah or the oil to be technical
[1:11:32] it wasn't the oil that hit the skin and
[1:11:35] said
[1:11:36] bird he said it was
[1:11:39] are you sure
[1:11:42] and you can say brothers
[1:11:44] I got the Holy Ghost I don't have any
[1:11:46] fear
[1:11:47] you want to test it
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:53] you want to test it tonight
[1:11:55] with your Holy Ghost
[1:11:57] holy
[1:11:58] amen see there's a place God's trying to
[1:12:01] get us back to her but we don't operate
[1:12:04] with any fear huh and you you might say
[1:12:06] Brothers I've been in this message a
[1:12:08] long time holy until you're raptured
[1:12:10] you'll always be fighting that spirit
[1:12:13] hold it but let me tell you something
[1:12:15] you can overcome it on this side
[1:12:17] yes you can you can overcome it on this
[1:12:19] side amen but you got to have more faith
[1:12:22] and fear amen you
[1:12:25] I don't have fear well let's go out to
[1:12:27] the lake and see if you can walk on
[1:12:37] if you can't do it there's another
[1:12:39] element there
[1:12:41] Hallelujah I believe we'll all get to
[1:12:44] that place hardly as there's a need
[1:12:47] but I don't believe God is in the
[1:12:49] business of showing off Hallelujah for
[1:12:52] church if we look and we see what Adam
[1:12:53] was Hallelujah before sin came in
[1:12:58] right earlier he had the nature of a God
[1:13:00] he had the language of a God hallelujah
[1:13:04] he was so much like God God brought
[1:13:07] creation to him and God said you name it
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:13] God wasn't afraid to put the world in
[1:13:16] Adam's hands
[1:13:18] and when you don't have fear God will be
[1:13:21] afraid to put the world in your hand
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:30] because he can't change if he did it
[1:13:33] before he has to do it again
[1:13:35] now let me encourage you Hallelujah the
[1:13:37] prophet of God said all that Adam lost
[1:13:40] is restored in Jesus Christ
[1:13:45] that's why the prophet came back and
[1:13:47] then he said that was empowering you to
[1:13:50] create a world and go live on
[1:13:55] Hallelujah
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:02] let's talk about it for a second
[1:14:07] this quote kind of caught me and jumped
[1:14:09] out at me but before I get there
[1:14:11] remember
[1:14:12] the Bible says in the Book of Job
[1:14:15] confessed over his own self
[1:14:18] he said for the thing that I greatly
[1:14:20] feared is come upon me
[1:14:23] and that which I was afraid of is come
[1:14:27] unto me
[1:14:28] now can you imagine like brother Chris
[1:14:30] said you out hunting a grizzly and he
[1:14:31] was like oh my Grizzly where are you
[1:14:34] oh my Grizzly where are you please don't
[1:14:37] come and kill me
[1:14:40] oh Mr Grizzly I know I'm not supposed to
[1:14:43] be out here in your territory so please
[1:14:45] don't sneak up on me and eat me
[1:14:48] with that mindset you're bound to get
[1:14:50] killed
[1:14:54] Hallelujah but you go out in the grizzly
[1:14:58] territory as the aggressor
[1:15:00] foreign
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:12] I'm coming out here to destroy you
[1:15:16] I'm coming out here to get me some
[1:15:18] bareburgers
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:23] Hallelujah and we got our weapons copped
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:27] and we're ready for the battle
[1:15:30] Hallelujah see you can't go out there
[1:15:33] Hallelujah if you don't know who you are
[1:15:36] think about it if if you're a fisherman
[1:15:39] and you go out there with your with your
[1:15:41] fish hook and everything say yeah I'm
[1:15:43] going out here to give me a big old I'm
[1:15:45] going out here to catch a Grizzly wrong
[1:15:47] weapon
[1:15:51] wrong weapon
[1:15:53] you Allure a man because I heard Bears
[1:15:55] like fish
[1:15:57] but you'll probably eat that fish and
[1:15:59] eat you
[1:16:01] you got to meet the enemy with something
[1:16:04] that can stop him
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:07] and the only thing that can stop the end
[1:16:10] me is the word of God
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:14] this is how I fight my battle
[1:16:18] this is how I fight by battle
[1:16:22] this is how I fight my battle this is
[1:16:26] how I fight my battle
[1:16:30] Hallelujah
[1:16:34] it may look like I'm alone but he's
[1:16:37] right there with me
[1:16:40] oh
[1:16:42] Church young people parents we fight the
[1:16:45] enemy with the word holy don't be afraid
[1:16:49] to speak the word because you don't have
[1:16:52] to back it up God does
[1:16:54] God has to back up the world
[1:16:58] let's get to fear out
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:07] okay let's move forward a little bit
[1:17:10] now we see who Adam was
[1:17:12] without any fear
[1:17:15] do we see that
[1:17:16] without any fear he was a god
[1:17:22] he was the strongest power on the earth
[1:17:25] at that time
[1:17:27] even stronger than the devil
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:35] you better read your Bible
[1:17:37] the devil didn't come to Adam he went to
[1:17:40] Eve
[1:17:44] because he thought Adam he saw that same
[1:17:47] one that kicked him out of head
[1:17:50] Hallelujah and the devil was afraid of
[1:17:54] Adam
[1:17:56] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] it to look like that one in heaven
[1:18:01] will be afraid of you
[1:18:04] Hallelujah
[1:18:06] do you begin to get the mannerisms of
[1:18:09] God the
[1:18:10] Thunder of God back inside your being
[1:18:12] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:18:15] you
[1:18:16] because when he sees you he sees the
[1:18:19] father
[1:18:21] and the Bible says the devil fear and
[1:18:24] tremble
[1:18:29] Hallelujah
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:34] Hallelujah
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:40] but before the enemy
[1:18:43] came in that's who Adam was
[1:18:45] God will come down in the cooler today
[1:18:48] they have Fellowship holy he could hear
[1:18:51] God's voice and understand every word
[1:18:55] he didn't need an interpreter he didn't
[1:18:58] even need hardly a pastor Hallelujah why
[1:19:01] earlier because God was doing something
[1:19:04] personal
[1:19:05] Hallelujah but seeing brought in all
[1:19:08] these other administrations so we can
[1:19:10] get back to God
[1:19:12] which we need today Hallelujah we need
[1:19:15] pastors we need evangelists prophets
[1:19:18] teachers holy we need to fight for
[1:19:20] Ministry
[1:19:22] Hallelujah and if you're in a church
[1:19:24] Hallelujah when the pastor doesn't bring
[1:19:26] in a FireFold Ministry that means he's
[1:19:29] afraid
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:41] foreign
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:51] Ministry that perfects the Saints
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:57] Hallelujah
[1:20:00] or maybe he got something to hide and
[1:20:02] he's afraid
[1:20:06] thank you
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:12] now for those of you who may get this
[1:20:14] tape remember Brothers I didn't call any
[1:20:17] names
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:22] I didn't call any names I didn't accuse
[1:20:25] anybody but you know who you are
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:35] Hallelujah
[1:20:37] this message came to restore
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:45] brother Brandon believed in the FireFold
[1:20:47] Ministry
[1:20:49] so how could you ever say you believe
[1:20:51] this message and don't believe in the
[1:20:53] Firefall Ministry
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:21:05] but I'll say like I always say Holly
[1:21:08] could be in I'm not a pastor
[1:21:12] I'm not a pastor so you know what I'm
[1:21:15] not connected to your feelings
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:19] I can boost the word I can slice I can
[1:21:21] cut I can Hammer Hallelujah
[1:21:24] I can Rejoice get on the plane and say
[1:21:26] praise God brother Ben let's do it again
[1:21:29] next year
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:33] but a pastor he's connected to your
[1:21:35] feelings hallelujah amen so there's an
[1:21:37] element he works with Hollywood which is
[1:21:40] called sensitivity
[1:21:50] I was created to kill demons
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:57] and I will stop firing into the gun is
[1:22:01] empty
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:13] Hallelujah
[1:22:17] but church we look
[1:22:19] I'm kind of stuck on Adam and Eve I got
[1:22:21] to move forward
[1:22:23] but that's our origin Hallelujah
[1:22:26] everything was good
[1:22:28] but then one day Satan came down and
[1:22:31] went to Eve and he tricked Eve
[1:22:34] how do you trick her yeah he enticed her
[1:22:37] but not only did he entice them he made
[1:22:40] her fearful
[1:22:41] [Applause]
[1:22:45] he made her scared she was missing out
[1:22:49] on something
[1:22:55] the first element of fear
[1:22:59] when you feel like you're missing out on
[1:23:01] something
[1:23:02] that's what he did to Eve he told us hey
[1:23:04] God just don't want you to know that
[1:23:06] you're gonna be as God ain't gonna know
[1:23:08] things just like him she already knew
[1:23:11] that
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:13] she came from Adam she knew everything
[1:23:15] that she needed to know for that moment
[1:23:18] for that time well let me ask you this
[1:23:20] what else did she receive after she
[1:23:23] dealt with the Devil
[1:23:31] because he's here's the scene
[1:23:33] God comes down in the cooler today and
[1:23:35] they sit at God's feet and have
[1:23:37] fellowship and rejoice and God speaks
[1:23:40] over them and talks over them amen and
[1:23:42] the animals and everything gather around
[1:23:44] and the atmosphere is wonderful
[1:23:46] Hallelujah then Satan comes in messes
[1:23:49] with Eve hurry gets in her head
[1:23:51] Hallelujah make her think she's missing
[1:23:54] something amen she goes takes from him
[1:23:56] then she goes and gives to Adam and God
[1:23:59] in his faithfulness comes down like he
[1:24:01] always does
[1:24:04] so there's nothing wrong with God
[1:24:07] there's nothing happen with the nature
[1:24:09] of God his nature remained the same
[1:24:12] Faith honest fear God comes down like he
[1:24:17] always did but in God coming down the
[1:24:20] Bible said they heard the voice of God
[1:24:22] walking in the cool of the day like it
[1:24:25] always did
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:27] but now because of sin they are afraid
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:34] where did it come from
[1:24:36] I want you young people to understand
[1:24:37] where fear comes from it comes from
[1:24:41] disobedience
[1:24:50] Eve simply being disobedient open
[1:24:53] herself up to fear
[1:24:55] a life of fear
[1:24:59] job
[1:25:01] searching from there
[1:25:03] God comes down
[1:25:05] just wanting to have Fellowship like he
[1:25:07] always does and Adam and Eve are like
[1:25:10] God is here
[1:25:12] they never did that before
[1:25:15] what caused them to run from God
[1:25:20] sin in their life
[1:25:23] and I'll tell you pastors the reason why
[1:25:26] you can't get certain things out of your
[1:25:28] church is because there's fear in their
[1:25:30] life
[1:25:33] there's some Seekers there's some sin
[1:25:35] there's some things they're holding on
[1:25:37] to that they're trying to cover remember
[1:25:39] God is faithful
[1:25:41] if you are preaching the truth
[1:25:42] hallelujah you're supposed to get the
[1:25:44] results of the truth and the only thing
[1:25:46] to stop those results is if the people's
[1:25:49] lives are not clean
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:53] oh you don't like that one huh
[1:26:00] please don't turn the Bloodhound leaves
[1:26:03] tonight
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:07] I want to just preach and we're going to
[1:26:10] rejoice in the word but if you resist me
[1:26:12] you turn me into a blood house
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:19] you will get the sniffing
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:24] we'll get to searching
[1:26:26] for those things that's holding back
[1:26:28] your worship
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:35] let me say it like this
[1:26:37] when did a devil ever sit in the
[1:26:40] presence of God and God didn't see him
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:47] and you think
[1:26:49] you think that height
[1:26:51] you think you can have things in your
[1:26:53] life that God won't address
[1:26:56] devil can never hide himself from God
[1:27:00] because God is the devil's creator
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:10] and usually people have fear in their
[1:27:12] life because they have secrets Adam and
[1:27:15] Eve thought they had a secret and they
[1:27:17] ran from God all before then God came
[1:27:20] down to their Fellowship they called to
[1:27:22] God they heard his voice there was no
[1:27:25] misunderstandings
[1:27:29] but now
[1:27:31] God comes down
[1:27:35] now they're covering themselves
[1:27:38] it's just all kind of fear go back and
[1:27:41] read it the Bible says when he created
[1:27:43] them and they were naked and what not
[1:27:46] ashamed
[1:27:50] yeah
[1:27:52] what's making you a shame tonight
[1:27:58] it has to be something in your life
[1:28:03] something that you're afraid may be
[1:28:05] exposed
[1:28:07] because that was the only reason why
[1:28:08] Adam and Eve ran because now they could
[1:28:11] see their members from their own eyes
[1:28:13] when they were already naked
[1:28:16] and God wasn't even worried about it
[1:28:19] but now Hallelujah something has gotten
[1:28:22] in this system to where they're looking
[1:28:24] at themselves differently
[1:28:27] that's what happens when you get off the
[1:28:29] word
[1:28:30] you start to look at themes that were
[1:28:33] already right and looking at it wrong
[1:28:40] everybody all right
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:44] Church
[1:28:46] now we can see because of sin in their
[1:28:49] life
[1:28:50] fear has come in to take over
[1:28:54] the walk for the rest of their lives
[1:28:59] fear is an element we have to deal with
[1:29:02] daily
[1:29:08] but you can live a life
[1:29:11] where fear doesn't have control over
[1:29:15] Hallelujah
[1:29:17] and you know Church
[1:29:19] God told them I'm gonna make a way for
[1:29:20] you to get back Hallelujah
[1:29:24] Hallelujah God made a way for us to get
[1:29:27] back God made a way for us to live above
[1:29:30] our fears
[1:29:31] but George I want to show you tonight
[1:29:32] that fear is not connected to your
[1:29:35] outward man
[1:29:38] no
[1:29:39] you're the proper God said there five
[1:29:42] senses that can contact your natural
[1:29:44] body
[1:29:45] and see case hear smell touch Hallelujah
[1:29:50] those things you can naturally do but
[1:29:53] fear is not holy connected to it
[1:29:57] fear is not connected to your eyes no
[1:30:00] it's that inside memory
[1:30:03] of what your eyes have seen that brings
[1:30:06] for fear
[1:30:09] fear is not connected to your touch no
[1:30:11] it's your inward Hallelujah affections
[1:30:14] and and memory and different things
[1:30:16] Hallelujah that brings back what will
[1:30:18] happen if you touch it
[1:30:22] so fear is not connected to the five
[1:30:24] senses to the outside fear is connected
[1:30:27] to the inward man
[1:30:30] okay
[1:30:33] Hallelujah
[1:30:35] listen if I can
[1:30:39] this is what the prophet of God says
[1:30:43] just to reiterate what I just said like
[1:30:45] brother Chris said I'll read you the
[1:30:47] quote
[1:30:49] he said now did you get them all if you
[1:30:52] don't then let me know know now you got
[1:30:56] them all down feet taste feel smell and
[1:31:00] hear the body
[1:31:02] that's the open to the body
[1:31:05] the soul is Imagination
[1:31:09] what happens if your imagination is
[1:31:11] connected to fear
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:18] I'll tell you
[1:31:20] a friend of mine I told I wasn't going
[1:31:22] to tell it but I'm gonna tell it
[1:31:26] a friend of mine when she was a young
[1:31:27] girl
[1:31:28] it wasn't uh she was she was outside
[1:31:31] staying in the country she was outside
[1:31:33] and she came out the house was going to
[1:31:36] the mailbox or something like that and
[1:31:38] the dog was up the street
[1:31:40] I think it was a pit bull
[1:31:42] the dog was up the street
[1:31:44] and dogs
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:48] you know why that dog was barking
[1:31:51] because he was afraid
[1:31:58] catch me good a rattlesnake won't bite
[1:32:01] you unless it's for free
[1:32:06] the animals of the Kingdom Hallelujah
[1:32:09] they won't mess with you if you're not
[1:32:11] messing with them unless
[1:32:16] Hallelujah so we heard it this morning
[1:32:18] how brother Chris said animals can sit
[1:32:21] your fear
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:24] and they don't just automatically attack
[1:32:26] they have to be afraid
[1:32:28] they have to feel like they're in danger
[1:32:31] and you know Church the the dog was
[1:32:34] barking and carrying on and caring on
[1:32:35] and she said it was a big old ditch that
[1:32:38] that separated her from the dog I said
[1:32:40] did it bite you said no cause they
[1:32:41] didn't chase you she said no I said what
[1:32:44] did he do she said barked at me like it
[1:32:46] wanted to bite me
[1:32:49] and for that reason
[1:32:52] I can't be around
[1:32:55] all she never got bit
[1:32:57] she never got chased
[1:33:00] the dog was just making noise
[1:33:04] but her imagination took it to a whole
[1:33:06] nother level
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:14] what happens when fear gets a hold of
[1:33:17] your imagination
[1:33:19] and now here she is 20 years later still
[1:33:22] afraid of a dog who never bit her
[1:33:27] never chase her
[1:33:29] never did anything but
[1:33:39] I wonder
[1:33:40] how many of us in here
[1:33:43] the devil has got a hold of our
[1:33:45] imagination
[1:33:48] Lord I really want to serve you but if I
[1:33:50] do that I'ma lose all my friends how do
[1:33:52] you know that
[1:33:55] you're imagining things
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] Lord I
[1:34:00] I really want to trust you and not take
[1:34:02] this medicine but I might die how do you
[1:34:05] know that
[1:34:09] it's your imagination
[1:34:15] oh I can feel it let's go
[1:34:18] surrounded by Your glory
[1:34:22] I feel like Dance For You Jesus
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] in your breath
[1:34:33] oh
[1:34:35] Hallelujah
[1:34:38] seeing it up I gotta lead
[1:34:42] yeah yeah
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:50] and y'all know what's coming next
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] I don't like that song
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:34:59] because we don't have to imagine
[1:35:02] we're going to be surrounded by yourself
[1:35:05] we're going to be friends we're going to
[1:35:09] look at his face we're going to touch
[1:35:11] his hands we're going to be with him
[1:35:13] forever
[1:35:14] so I don't have to imagine what it's
[1:35:17] going to be like
[1:35:18] dance is the reality
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:22] the Born Again experience the problem is
[1:35:25] all it says it's your down payment
[1:35:29] I have a down payment
[1:35:31] I already got a kick it to Heaven I
[1:35:34] don't have to imagine
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:40] Hallelujah will you imagine things can
[1:35:44] change
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:48] when it comes to God we don't have to
[1:35:50] imagine
[1:35:52] we have scripture which is a promise
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:57] but if you're going to imagine
[1:36:02] let it work for your good
[1:36:05] say things like I can't wait
[1:36:09] I'm in heaven
[1:36:10] there with Peter James and John honey I
[1:36:14] can't wait Hallelujah to sit down with
[1:36:16] David oh yeah and for him to describe to
[1:36:20] me what it was like we're gonna lie if
[1:36:23] we're down
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:27] what it was like to have a real hunting
[1:36:30] season when David tell me hallelujah how
[1:36:34] he slapped that bear how he slapped that
[1:36:36] Lionheart in the arm and he took that
[1:36:38] seat back

[1:36:44] to see the faith alone we're going to
[1:36:46] talk to him
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:51] Hallelujah
[1:36:53] the Bible says hallelujah say without us
[1:36:56] it's been perfect
[1:36:58] it's got to happen
[1:37:02] Hallelujah
[1:37:04] so if you're going to imagine
[1:37:07] what's written is true
[1:37:11] it's true
[1:37:13] and even right now the Bible says in the
[1:37:15] last days the world me and his Hearts

[1:38:52] the church
[1:38:57] we ain't going that far at my church we
[1:39:00] still believe in the angel of the Lord
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:03] who can wipe out 36 000 demons just like
[1:39:06] that
[1:39:07] we don't have to be afraid
[1:39:09] amen God came out of the Hezekiah and
[1:39:13] told him he shall not come into the city
[1:39:16] Hallelujah then God went down and
[1:39:18] destroyed all of them amen that's the
[1:39:21] God we saw
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:24] because when we look when you look and
[1:39:26] you see
[1:39:27] what is connected to the inward man
[1:39:30] look he says the soul is the imagination
[1:39:33] just imagine if fear is connected to
[1:39:35] your imagination
[1:39:37] before you could even do something we
[1:39:39] begin to imagine
[1:39:43] some of you young Brothers Hallelujah
[1:39:46] you can't even go talk to that Christian
[1:39:47] young girl because you imagine it
[1:39:52] she gonna shoot me down
[1:39:56] how do you know
[1:40:01] how do you know you may be the the
[1:40:04] knight in shining armor that she's been
[1:40:06] waiting on
[1:40:10] but you let your imagination run before
[1:40:13] you and you stay single
[1:40:19] and you let fear suppress your desire
[1:40:24] foreign
[1:40:26] and wanting a Christian woman is a Godly
[1:40:29] desire and you let fear Hallelujah get
[1:40:33] in your imagination and suppress a Godly
[1:40:36] desire
[1:40:38] shame on you
[1:40:42] sister y'all should see how these
[1:40:43] brothers looking at me now

[1:40:49] look I'm gonna give you a little
[1:40:51] one-on-one and I'm gonna leave this
[1:40:52] alone
[1:40:53] Brothers holy Don't Be Afraid all she
[1:40:57] can say is two things
[1:40:59] yes or no
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:04] Hallelujah just go through the proper
[1:41:06] channels amen
[1:41:08] make sure you go through the proper
[1:41:09] channels amen and everything will be
[1:41:11] done decent and in order
[1:41:14] but if you are afraid you know what
[1:41:16] you'll do you'll go in them DMs
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:26] hey if you afraid of Papa
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:31] you afraid of Papa you slide into the
[1:41:34] Dead
[1:41:37] the fear in your life
[1:41:39] Hallelujah
[1:41:41] but if you're a man and you you you're
[1:41:43] confident that your experience is right
[1:41:45] you won't be afraid to go to Papa and
[1:41:47] talk to Papa about Papa's angel
[1:41:50] but if you got secrets
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:54] you got fees Hallelujah that you're
[1:41:57] afraid might come out you continue to
[1:42:00] slide
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:07] yeah parents I want you to know
[1:42:09] this world has made it real easy
[1:42:13] for your innocent children to come in
[1:42:15] contact with the unsaved world
[1:42:19] and I'm not so much talking about in the
[1:42:21] world I'm talking about in here
[1:42:25] young men that are not converted
[1:42:28] girls that are not converted trying to
[1:42:31] get your children
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:37] but you have to stay highly on guard
[1:42:41] Don't Be Afraid earlier to tell your
[1:42:43] child no yes
[1:42:47] Hallelujah
[1:42:48] I know we've getting a little bit more
[1:42:50] lenient and things like that but look
[1:42:52] the devil ain't playing
[1:42:54] come to kill still in the storm
[1:42:57] Hallelujah and how often do we see
[1:43:00] Hallelujah some some young guy or some
[1:43:03] young woman slide into the DMS and they
[1:43:05] get close and next thing you know they
[1:43:07] take their virtue and then dump them
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:12] don't want them no more
[1:43:17] let me let me leave it
[1:43:24] out but imagine
[1:43:26] that's your imagination brothers and
[1:43:28] sisters and you notice I said Brothers
[1:43:32] approaching not sisters
[1:43:36] Hallelujah
[1:43:37] Brothers It's not their job
[1:43:40] [Applause]
[1:43:44] I hope y'all paying attention
[1:43:49] it's not their job to be in your face
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:44:04] and let me tell you some sisters ain't
[1:44:07] no godly man looking for that anyway
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:14] Hallelujah
[1:44:17] cause they're making real plain I know
[1:44:20] brother Chris talked about hunting and
[1:44:21] hunting bears and different things but
[1:44:22] let's make it only bring it up to a
[1:44:24] smaller scale think about deers
[1:44:26] Hallelujah
[1:44:28] you never you've never seen a door or
[1:44:31] buck jump out and say here I am
[1:44:36] no that man had to hunt
[1:44:38] he had to spend time in the area he had
[1:44:41] to drop food he had to put cameras up
[1:44:53] so she jumping out there saying here I
[1:44:55] am you look the other way
[1:44:59] let me leave it alone
[1:45:03] listen
[1:45:05] the soul is the imagination
[1:45:08] conscious
[1:45:09] think about when fear is connected to
[1:45:12] your conscience
[1:45:14] there's certain things you can't even
[1:45:15] believe God in because the enemy is
[1:45:17] messing with your conscience
[1:45:19] if I do this disclaim if I do that that
[1:45:21] will happen you remember the last time
[1:45:23] when that happened
[1:45:25] the enemy messing with your conscience
[1:45:28] fear in your conscience your imagination
[1:45:30] your conscience let's keep going
[1:45:34] and this is the one that gets all of us
[1:45:38] memory
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:44] you may try to do so many turns out
[1:45:46] wrong
[1:45:47] and then Satan will come and say you
[1:45:49] remember last time
[1:45:51] you remember last time don't you don't
[1:45:53] you do that
[1:45:54] you went down this road and this and
[1:45:56] that don't you do that all right now
[1:45:59] but maybe the last time you did he
[1:46:01] wasn't safe
[1:46:04] Maybe This Time God is leading you
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:08] Maybe This Time God is in control
[1:46:11] so don't let your memory of things pass
[1:46:14] stop you Hallelujah from living in your
[1:46:16] presence
[1:46:17] [Applause]
[1:46:19] Hallelujah don't let the memory of past
[1:46:22] mistakes Hallelujah stop you from
[1:46:24] believing God is real
[1:46:29] Hallelujah
[1:46:32] imagination
[1:46:36] conscience
[1:46:37] memory
[1:46:39] and this is you you see how they so
[1:46:42] easily be affected by fear
[1:46:45] and the next one is reasoning
[1:46:51] we good at that
[1:46:55] we're good at reasoning
[1:46:58] you know God will come specifically and
[1:47:00] say certain things through the word of
[1:47:02] God or through the ministry and the
[1:47:04] first thing we give God is a conjunction
[1:47:07] Lord but
[1:47:09] recently
[1:47:14] reasoning earlier
[1:47:16] when it's connected to your fear it can
[1:47:20] stop you from moving forward in God
[1:47:23] it can stop you from seeing things that
[1:47:26] God has ordained for you to see because
[1:47:28] you reason it away
[1:47:30] remember the scripture says it's for our
[1:47:32] benefit the scripture says what come let
[1:47:35] us reason together
[1:47:38] so reasoning is supposed to work for the
[1:47:41] believer's benefit
[1:47:42] but if fear is connected to it you
[1:47:45] reason yourself out of God's plan
[1:47:50] and we have so many churches so many
[1:47:52] spread out Believers different places
[1:47:55] and everything why because of
[1:48:05] well that past is a good pastor but
[1:48:11] I believe he's preaching the word of God
[1:48:13] but
[1:48:20] earlier and normally when you're
[1:48:22] reasoning what are you doing when you're
[1:48:25] reasoning against the word of God you're
[1:48:27] calling God a liar
[1:48:36] um
[1:48:39] keep in mind when I said you're reading
[1:48:42] the word of God
[1:48:43] now to make a real plane the Bible says
[1:48:46] that God is our healer
[1:48:48] and for you to reason away from that
[1:48:51] you're killing God no he's not
[1:48:53] God says he's our provider and you won't
[1:48:57] pay your tithes you're saying God is a
[1:49:00] liar
[1:49:07] we afraid to trust him
[1:49:11] like my pastor say he don't he don't
[1:49:14] normally just come out and take a text
[1:49:15] and preach on tithing but what he do
[1:49:17] he's trying to help somebody
[1:49:19] and what he'll say he said it real plane
[1:49:22] say look the Bible says if you do what
[1:49:24] you're blessed ties an offering is a
[1:49:26] blessing
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:32] I can't believe it we're still wrestling
[1:49:34] with that
[1:49:35] we're still wrestling with pain tithe
[1:49:37] that's so Elementary one two three
[1:49:41] we should be waving we we know seals and
[1:49:44] Thunders and everything and can't pay
[1:49:46] tops
[1:49:51] you're going to be kidding me
[1:49:54] we got all the mysteries of God
[1:49:56] hallelujah and keep a touch
[1:50:00] denomination got more Revelation than
[1:50:03] you in that area
[1:50:08] brother Brown never preach on money well
[1:50:12] in case you didn't know this I'm not
[1:50:14] Brother Bruno
[1:50:20] and like my pastor always says he says
[1:50:22] look when I go down these Avenues what
[1:50:25] I'm trying to do is get you to see what
[1:50:26] the scripture says the scripture says
[1:50:28] you're blessed if you do it you're
[1:50:30] blessed if you don't you curse if you're
[1:50:32] not praying your tiers and say I'm
[1:50:34] trying to get the curse out your life
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:41] foreign
[1:50:45] you don't get to tell God how to judge
[1:50:48] you
[1:50:52] you don't get to tell God how to deal
[1:50:55] with you in this area he may not only
[1:50:57] deal with your finances he might let the
[1:50:59] devil have your health
[1:51:01] because they didn't say I will curse you
[1:51:04] this way
[1:51:07] so don't play with God
[1:51:10] don't be afraid
[1:51:12] church I've seen God take a hundred
[1:51:14] dollars and stretch it
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:18] y'all got a witness in here
[1:51:21] only one
[1:51:22] only one person to see God stretch it
[1:51:26] I've seen God straight to church
[1:51:29] just being faithful to God earlier and
[1:51:32] God take what I give it to him and make
[1:51:35] that thing laugh and laugh and laugh and
[1:51:38] laugh then you put some more on top of
[1:51:40] it and then laugh and laugh laugh let me
[1:51:42] put some more problems and laugh and
[1:51:44] laugh
[1:51:47] he promised that he will provide our
[1:51:50] needs
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:56] and if you Hallelujah do not pay tithe
[1:51:59] and offering that's because you have
[1:52:01] fear in your life
[1:52:13] and the last one is affection
[1:52:17] what about your fears are connected to
[1:52:19] affection
[1:52:22] it's like people
[1:52:24] who've been hurt
[1:52:27] you take a young lady or a young man
[1:52:29] you've been hurt when he was a child
[1:52:32] or maybe molested or something like that
[1:52:37] let me say something while I'm preaching
[1:52:40] if I'm saying certain things and I'm
[1:52:41] hitting certain things that mean it's in
[1:52:43] here
[1:52:45] because I can't preach on anything
[1:52:47] that's covered already by the blood
[1:52:50] so in order for me to speak only that
[1:52:52] means it's on the top yes it's not
[1:52:54] covered
[1:52:56] so your fear of molestation can be dealt
[1:52:58] with tonight
[1:53:00] holy God can deal with that Spirit where
[1:53:03] you'll never have to deal with the
[1:53:05] memory of it again affecting your son
[1:53:08] Hallelujah
[1:53:10] there are people in church carrying
[1:53:12] these things that happen to them in
[1:53:13] their childhood
[1:53:15] and it produces a life of fear you think
[1:53:19] a young man or a young lady that maybe
[1:53:21] had those issues when they were younger
[1:53:23] and now they're married Hallelujah they
[1:53:26] can't even be true Hallelujah to the one
[1:53:28] that loved them because of the fear in
[1:53:30] their life
[1:53:34] living
[1:53:35] in their memory
[1:53:37] living in their conscience living
[1:53:40] Hallelujah
[1:53:42] in their imagination
[1:53:45] and now they're living in their
[1:53:46] affections
[1:53:48] because things have happened that
[1:53:50] produce the fear
[1:53:53] I ain't gonna be too much longer y'all
[1:53:54] know I'm about to close
[1:53:59] but Church think about it I like how
[1:54:02] brother Chris was saying that
[1:54:05] we've been equipped with training
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:10] and when you're confident in your
[1:54:12] training there's no fear
[1:54:19] when you know you've took time
[1:54:22] to get the proper training
[1:54:24] when you get to the fight you rely on
[1:54:27] that training
[1:54:29] and normally the person that trains you
[1:54:32] have already been through it
[1:54:36] foreign
[1:54:37] and if God has given us his word
[1:54:40] hallelujah for whatever battle it may be
[1:54:42] that means God has already conquered it
[1:54:46] so all we have to do is stay with the
[1:54:48] training that God has given us
[1:54:50] he's given us the weapons of warfare
[1:54:52] which are not carnal
[1:54:55] but they're given to us to to pull down
[1:54:57] these stroke holes in our life
[1:55:02] and you don't have to be afraid to serve
[1:55:05] God
[1:55:08] amen oh yeah
[1:55:11] let me read you something right quick
[1:55:18] listen with the prophet God said this
[1:55:20] isn't a mess it's a personal experience
[1:55:21] with God
[1:55:23] paragraph 43.
[1:55:26] this he says
[1:55:28] he says this loving him he said oh
[1:55:31] we say we have faith
[1:55:34] we have love
[1:55:35] but if we had love we'd have faith for
[1:55:39] that is perfect love casts out all fear
[1:55:43] and this is what I like when you say
[1:55:45] that as little as he says and when fear
[1:55:47] is gone faith is perfect
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:52] so think about that tonight Hallelujah
[1:55:55] if we could create an atmosphere
[1:55:57] Hallelujah
[1:55:58] amen of True Divine love
[1:56:01] if we can create an atmosphere where we
[1:56:03] love God
[1:56:05] if we love God
[1:56:07] fear is gone and Faith becomes perfectly
[1:56:12] Church basically I'm saying hallelujah
[1:56:14] if we create an atmosphere where there
[1:56:17] is no fear you can have whatever you ask
[1:56:19] God for
[1:56:22] amen because Faith becomes perfect in
[1:56:25] that channel
[1:56:27] and you can receive what you believe in
[1:56:29] God for if there's no fear a lot of
[1:56:32] times we don't get what we're asking God
[1:56:34] for because we don't believe it because
[1:56:36] we got so many natural things connected
[1:56:39] to it when God just wants us to take him
[1:56:42] at his word
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:46] Hallelujah
[1:56:48] that's all you want
[1:56:49] he want us to take him at his word
[1:56:52] he says now did you get them all nah I
[1:56:55] ain't gonna read that oh
[1:56:57] he said see
[1:56:58] it's your mind
[1:57:00] that opens up the door
[1:57:05] what causes us to fear your stars right
[1:57:08] here
[1:57:09] the problem of God said your mind is a
[1:57:11] womb
[1:57:14] and before Satan gets any way with you
[1:57:17] he has to plant a seed here
[1:57:19] to get you to believe it
[1:57:21] the prophet of God say before it
[1:57:24] manifestes as a spirit it has to be
[1:57:27] received as a thought first
[1:57:32] how do people get cast in their body
[1:57:35] they receive what the doctors say right
[1:57:40] right most people just living their
[1:57:41] lives they mind their business going on
[1:57:43] they say hey I'm gonna go get a checkup
[1:57:44] feeling good they go get the check up
[1:57:47] and the dollars like oh my we found the
[1:57:49] lump they didn't even know the lump was
[1:57:50] there
[1:57:52] living a regular life
[1:57:54] doing what they normally do going to
[1:57:56] work playing with the kids everything
[1:57:58] everything's good
[1:58:00] and you mean to tell me a lump go alter
[1:58:02] my life
[1:58:08] I can hit you in your arm real hard
[1:58:09] that's the thing we call a frog you know
[1:58:11] pop up in your arm just a regular law
[1:58:14] and you mean to tell me that I can alter
[1:58:16] your life
[1:58:17] just a bruise
[1:58:20] what happens when fear is connected to
[1:58:23] us
[1:58:24] then it turns into something that you
[1:58:26] are believing in
[1:58:32] give it life
[1:58:35] and y'all know my story I had cancer in
[1:58:37] my brain Hallelujah but God in his his
[1:58:42] his grace
[1:58:44] Hallelujah
[1:58:45] a loud a word to be given to me from
[1:58:49] someone who wasn't afraid of cancer
[1:58:53] man I thank God for Mama
[1:58:55] [Music]
[1:58:59] she could have been oh no my child's
[1:59:02] gonna die oh he got cast in his brain
[1:59:04] she walked in the hospital room and say
[1:59:06] son you don't have to receive this
[1:59:12] she said my God Is A Healer by his
[1:59:15] stripes you're healed and all you got to
[1:59:17] do is confess it and believe it and God
[1:59:20] will honor his word
[1:59:22] Hallelujah so what I'm saying to your
[1:59:25] church sometimes even if Hallelujah your
[1:59:28] children don't believe Hallelujah you
[1:59:30] can stand in the gap
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:36] somebody need to stand in the gap
[1:59:39] and stop worrying about what you see
[1:59:41] them doing and believe what you know God
[1:59:44] can do
[1:59:45] Hallelujah I don't live by my eyesight
[1:59:49] amen I don't live by my my regular
[1:59:51] seasons of the body I live by faith
[1:59:55] we live by faith Hallelujah
[2:00:02] church and we made the whole hospital
[2:00:05] system out to be alive
[2:00:08] [Applause]
[2:00:11] go away
[2:00:15] we throw chemotherapy go back where you
[2:00:17] came from not this time
[2:00:20] put your radiation go back where you
[2:00:23] came from not this time all I got is out
[2:00:26] there 53.
[2:00:29] and I'm gonna stand on that and believe
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:37] and if you ever see God move once oh
[2:00:43] the prophet of God said you meet those

[2:13:01] things because we don't believe
[2:13:03] and there's a fear connected to it but
[2:13:05] in church

[2:13:15] go through things because God has
[2:13:17] something special for you in return
[2:13:19] but he wants you to stand
[2:13:21] and you know he was just right the card
[2:13:24] out or whatever and you know it was

[2:14:48] all his fellow workers were gone from
[2:14:50] home going home he accidentally locked
[2:14:54] himself in a refrigerated boxcar
[2:14:58] now can you imagine getting locked up in
[2:15:01] a refrigerator train car
[2:15:03] and everybody's gone
[2:15:06] listen
[2:15:07] he said worried that the temperature was
[2:15:10] below freezing he yelled for help now
[2:15:13] he's panicking he said but to no avail
[2:15:16] the more he thought oh
[2:15:20] not fear is in his mind it's creating
[2:15:22] something
[2:15:23] he said the more he thought about the
[2:15:25] situation the colder he felt
[2:15:28] listen his thoughts is dealing with his
[2:15:32] body
[2:15:34] he hadn't even been that long but just
[2:15:37] his thought process started to make him
[2:15:39] cold
[2:15:41] Ma
[2:15:42] your thought process can make you cold
[2:15:45] when it comes to the things of God
[2:15:49] listen
[2:15:50] Dakota he felt to eventually he started
[2:15:53] shivering unconditionally
[2:15:55] his thoughts was doing that
[2:15:59] he's panicking so I'm in the Box call me
[2:16:01] in the refrigerator he's yelling hell
[2:16:03] his mind is saying You Finna die
[2:16:09] convinced he was dying
[2:16:12] Who convinced him
[2:16:16] nobody else was in there with him nobody
[2:16:19] was at work who convinced him he was
[2:16:22] dying
[2:16:25] the thoughts he received you know who
[2:16:27] convinced him fear
[2:16:31] listen
[2:16:33] he wrote a letter to his family
[2:16:35] outlining what had happened the next
[2:16:38] morning they found Nick's body and
[2:16:41] autopsy revealed that he indeed frozen
[2:16:45] to death
[2:16:48] sure

[2:16:51] himself to die did he die
[2:16:55] let's keep reading
[2:16:58] he died it says the options revealed
[2:17:01] that he indeed froze to death
[2:17:04] but the investigation discovers
[2:17:06] something puzzling
[2:17:08] The Boxcar in which Nick was trapped was
[2:17:12] out of order and had been disconnected
[2:17:19] the refrigerated boxcar was not even
[2:17:22] working
[2:17:24] so what was making him cold fear
[2:17:27] what was freezing his body fear
[2:17:31] what made him die in that box car fear
[2:17:37] fear controlled his whole body
[2:17:43] it had been disconnected the night he
[2:17:47] froze to death listen the temperature in
[2:17:49] the boss car was 61 degrees
[2:17:53] just
[2:17:55] below room temperature
[2:18:00] he could have lived in there to the next
[2:18:02] morning
[2:18:04] but fear created an atmosphere of what
[2:18:08] that
[2:18:11] fear creating an atmosphere of death and
[2:18:14] he received the spirit of death and then
[2:18:16] he died
[2:18:18] in a boxcar which was normal temperature
[2:18:24] but because the experience he but
[2:18:27] because he expected to die he lost the
[2:18:30] battle where in his mind
[2:18:35] listen how this whole thing started out
[2:18:38] Nick was a tough guy
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:45] he was so tough
[2:18:47] he killed himself
[2:18:54] he was a tough guy with what
[2:18:57] a bad Outlook
[2:19:00] don't let the devil give you a bad
[2:19:02] Outlook
[2:19:04] on what it means to be a Christian
[2:19:08] right because if you take on that kind
[2:19:10] of attitude you might end up killing
[2:19:13] yourself
[2:19:17] just below room temperature but because
[2:19:19] he expected to die he lost a battle in

[2:23:20] take you to new levels of victory
[2:23:23] but it's up to you to take the first
[2:23:26] step
[2:23:29] come on musicians
[2:23:33] musicians come
[2:23:36] as we wrap this up
[2:23:40] when fear was gone
[2:23:43] Adam could hear the voice of God
[2:23:46] and remain in the presence of God
[2:23:49] and not be afraid
[2:23:51] when fear was gone Peter could walk on
[2:23:55] water
[2:23:57] Hallelujah he said Jesus there's a
[2:24:00] spirit he said it is I don't be afraid
[2:24:02] then Peter says Hey Lord if that's you
[2:24:04] being me to come Jesus didn't say go and
[2:24:07] pray
[2:24:08] he didn't say going fast he didn't say
[2:24:11] wait on the special meetings he said
[2:24:13] come on
[2:24:15] and Peter stepped out on something in
[2:24:18] his life that wasn't solid and it became
[2:24:21] solid
[2:24:26] and these guys were fishermen he knew he
[2:24:29] wasn't supposed to walk on that water
[2:24:31] but what gave him the strength to do it
[2:24:34] he had his eyes on Jesus
[2:24:36] and as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus
[2:24:39] there was no fear in his walk
[2:24:42] there was no fear in his steps as long
[2:24:45] as he kept his eyes on Jesus every step
[2:24:49] he made was a solid step
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:52] even though in previous days hallelujah
[2:24:56] he would have Saint in that water
[2:24:58] but this was a moment God was going to
[2:25:00] show him where his faith can take him if
[2:25:05] there's no fear
[2:25:08] Peter walks on water he gets out there
[2:25:11] and the Bible says a tempestuous
[2:25:13] boisterous wind comes
[2:25:15] he takes his eyes off Jesus
[2:25:19] and he focuses back in on fear
[2:25:22] and he begins to
[2:25:26] begin what happened nothing happened
[2:25:27] with Jesus
[2:25:29] nothing happened with the water it was
[2:25:31] still the same water
[2:25:33] it was all in how Peter saw it
[2:25:38] when he was walking in faith with his
[2:25:40] eyes on Christ he was doing things that
[2:25:43] he couldn't naturally do he was back
[2:25:46] Hallelujah fulfilling what Adam was
[2:25:50] Hallelujah
[2:25:51] character let me let's make this real
[2:25:53] plane that was without the Holy Ghost
[2:25:58] [Music]
[2:26:01] there's levels to this thing
[2:26:05] look
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:08] and then Peter begins to sink and he
[2:26:11] cries out to Jesus save me
[2:26:13] and God grabs him and pulls him up and
[2:26:16] the first thing God does
[2:26:17] [Music]
[2:26:21] why does he rebuke him
[2:26:23] because he's supposed to have the faith
[2:26:26] to control his surroundings
[2:26:28] he's supposed to have the faith to
[2:26:31] control his walk
[2:26:32] he's supposed to have faith Hallelujah
[2:26:35] to make every step a solid step
[2:26:39] and you are supposed to have the faith
[2:26:43] to control the steps that you'll take
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:48] when fear was gone he walked on water
[2:26:51] when fear came back he began to sink
[2:26:55] and I'll end with the same thing from
[2:26:57] this morning
[2:27:01] when fear was gone
[2:27:03] David killed the lion
[2:27:06] David killed the bear
[2:27:10] when there was no fear
[2:27:12] David walked up to a nine foot man
[2:27:16] [Music]
[2:27:18] Hallelujah that the whole Army was
[2:27:21] afraid of
[2:27:23] that kingdoms and nations were afraid of
[2:27:26] David walked up to him
[2:27:28] looked him in his face and prophesied
[2:27:31] over here
[2:27:36] David looked at everybody else's fears
[2:27:38] and said I'ma show you what a Son of God
[2:27:41] is supposed to operate
[2:27:43] [Applause]

[2:28:00] [Applause]
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:02] thing about prophecy Hallelujah
[2:28:05] prophecy doesn't operate inferior
[2:28:07] operates in faith and David spoke cut
[2:28:10] Goliath's head off and didn't even have
[2:28:13] a sword
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:16] Hallelujah
[2:28:19] that's when you're walking in a real
[2:28:21] atmosphere
[2:28:22] [Applause]
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:24] where you can speak the things you need
[2:28:27] and it'll show up in battle
[2:28:30] Hallelujah David didn't have a sword but
[2:28:34] when the light went down David ran up on
[2:28:36] Goliath and used the enemy sword against
[2:28:39] him
[2:28:40] [Applause]
[2:28:42] now all the things the devil told you
[2:28:44] you wouldn't be I want you to use that
[2:28:47] stuff against him honey
