we've me here to worship you and to praise you this evening thank you for the songs Lord and we just pray you'll bless the word that would be spoken tonight Lord and bless the um the prayer service

places we just um commit all things to you in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord amen thank you very much musicians while you remain standing let's um turn into our Bibles to uh 1st Samuel 14 verses 6 to 7 how are you all this evening you're good all happy 12 out of 10 it's always my confession no matter how I feel sometimes maybe my body tells me and my mental state tells me I'm hovering around about three but my mouth confesses at 12 13 you know we go through ups and downs as a human and I don't know that we can avoid that but I'll be glad one day when we're in a place where this flesh doesn't Hound us anymore where we're where we're always 100 out of 10 amen um okay so this this scripture here is 1st Samuel 146 to7 says and Jonathan said to the young man that bear his armor come and let us go over unto the Garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there is no Restraint of the Lord to save by many or by few and as armir said unto to him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold I with thee according to thy heart amen may the Lord bless his word you can take your seats um this evening being a Wednesday night I've got about 25 20 25 minutes so it's just a little short sort of sermonette that I've prepared because we um brother bradam said we can we can uh sing too much we can maybe speak too much but we can't pray too much so we want to make sure we leave time to to um pray um and um sorry give me a second but yeah I've just got a I've got a thought here tonight that I want to speak on and it's a it's a thought called um little thought I had called armor bear I think brother Ben was preaching about um David one time you know and he and he read in the scripture and the this the scripture when Goliath was coming towards David then it said that he had a an armor bear a man that bore his shield and I don't know you just hear that it's sort of what sometimes it's not even to do with what's being preached but a little snippet of inspiration turns up there and you think that's an interesting thing they got a guy there that's walking around and carrying something for another guy and then you know but um I've just got I I um it's a it's a simple thought depending on how simple you want it to be because it can be a very deep thought when you look into it a wee bit more we're not going to be able to go too into a whole lot of stuff cuz we've only got a short amount of time but but it's the concept that of of supporting somebody else or something or some sort of cause is this this concept of being an armor Bearer and and depending on it you can make it quite simple like some of the examples I've got are quite simple and and a like that the young fellas understand the simple concept but then they do get quite deep when you really think about this concept of an armor Bearer and yeah essentially what the Lord could be so I just want to uh just uh kind of run through a a little bit about the uh duties and the sort of characteristics of what typically was an armor Bearer because I don't believe we have them anymore anyone seen like uh a guy with a machine gun and maybe a a guy next to him running with maybe his ammunition maybe in the big machine guns but typically we don't really have what they call armor bearers but they were quite a common it was a common sort of position and uh back in the in biblical times anyway and in other kingdoms had them as well and usually noble people had armor bearers and the the the name almost does them a disservice because they weren't just a nobody that just carried around a little piece of armor they were they were generally a very skilled Warrior that that could protect the the king or whoever it was that they were bearing armor for they I mean these guys had their own armor and they they would in the battle these men would fight with the King and they would protect the king King but they would also fight and so and they were they so they were skilled people they were picked specifically for the job it wasn't just the sort of the dropouts that couldn't make it in the in the Army got the job of being the armor beer because there'd be no good when the king's under pressure and the armor beer doesn't know how to use his sword you know so um but that being said the position of an armor Bearer is always of a lower rank than the one that is served by default because they sort of serve the king orever it is the they bearing armor for I believe joab had 10 of these guys you're almost like bodyguards he had 10 armor bearers because he was the one his armor bearers killed um Absalom I think it was joab sort of threw the spears but then because they weren't allowed to kill the Absalom he had his armor beer is going and do his dirty work for him right yeah so he said I didn't kill him that's like politics you know wasn't me you know and the position is given to someone in great trust is as it is the duty of the armor Bearer to and I've just listed out a few things uh first one is to strengthen the position of his officer and the second one is to exalt and uplift his officer you can start to see it's a very much very supportive important role to respect his officer uh to agree with and submit to his officer very submissive role it's like I'm all in to serve you and we live together we fight together we die together yeah these men were serious pretty well if you if the if your main guy died you and you were still alive you had problems so you just sort of did the deed to yourself because you're going to be in trouble anyway later on so that's how dedicated they were to their king or whoever it was they were protecting you you supposed to repel any kind of attack against his officer especially his back there's a there's a certain side of a of a a fighter I think it's the right side that that it's unprotected on that side more than this side so the armor Bearer would always be protecting the side that the the the king fighting couldn't as easily protect he was always on there and repelling any any attacks from that side um rescue his officer from difficulty and hardship in order to prevent shame another one is keep watch while his officer rests uh react with total intolerance to any false accusations against his officer R gossip talking behind his back they had his back all the time more than just a hired servant Aid his officer and spiritual combat and demonstrate extreme loyalty quite a sort of powerful position even though it's a position of servitude you know some some positions of servitude are quite powerful positions although Jesus did say that the greatest among you shall be your servant and he was the he he was the servant of all now this is but I want to just spin it around a we bit maybe the children will find this amusing but you could potentially be an armor Bearer for a loser imagine that you're being an armor Bearer for a loser right so what are you going to end up to be a loser like brother Albero said if you marry an idiot you become Mrs idiot if you team up with a bear arms for a loser you become arm a bear a loser you know and when you think this this is a simple concept but the thing that you support because you because an armor bear essentially supports something if you support something that's a lost cause when that cause goes down so will you yeah see now the a typical example of a armor Bearer that was bearing arms for a loser was the armor Bearer that bore arms for Goliath amen and yet he thought he was such a winner cuz he thought his man was the greatest most strongest fiercest Warrior out there little did he know that he was a loser often times that's the way the world tricks us Satan puts some sort of rock star in front of us to the kids and they make this guy look like such an awesome person but he's a loser cuz he's on Shaky Ground cuz he's not his life isn't built on the word of God he's a loser and you build your life on his example or her example amen you become a loser too and you Bu you're building on Shaky Ground the Bible says and the Philistine came came near and Drew near unto David and the man that bear his shield went with him his armor Bearer and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and Ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistines said unto David am I a dog that th comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistines said to David come to me and I'll give Thee I will give thy flesh unto the fouls of the air and to the beasts of the field now I want you to look at something look at the armor beer and all these pictures because as the Goliath is is speaking out all these gloating about how Great and Mighty he is and how he's going to defeat this little David guy the armor Bearer is going along with it thinking yeah that's us you know cuz he's in the same spirit cuz he's supporting the same thing so you you can just see it on his face I quite like this I don't know if you can see that face but he's like he looks pretty smug like this one here come to me I'll give thy flesh unto the fouls of the air to the Beast of the field and the little armor beer is emulating it yeah come on you know because he feels like he's on the winning team or this one you know he just he just looks smug doesn't he you know but you know the ways of God are far above our way sometimes what looks powerful to man is just foolishness to God and that's how Satan works is to try and trick us to think something's great and God's often in the little things the things that don't look like they're going to achieve much seems to be where God seems to hide himself like he HIIT himself in Mary and and in this case he HIIT himself for little David you know this Ruddy little guy that just gets made fun of but I'd rather be an armor Bearer for David carrier Stones I me to carry your Stones because his Stone was going to defeat that enemy he was the winner brother bam says but the strange thing that God brought his son to the Earth through this little virgin talking about Mary she had been riding all day on the back of a donkey and there was no room for her at the hotel and God so chose it that his only begotten son was born in a stable in a Manger how simple God does things that sometimes that sometimes is to conf fuse the minds of the wise and prudent it doesn't look that much so that babes will have a chance to to know it and if God Through the Ages has done this and many times what he does seems to be ridiculous in the sight of The World God can do some of the most ridiculous things in the eyes of the world so don't be deceived by what you see big old strong Goliath and little old David but God was with David because his word was in David see this guy here what do they call him the they called this guy the king of rock where is he now yep he's gone lost but he's declared to this day the king of rock but he lost y so so the people that followed him and went along with his thing and that then the millions he dragged down to Hell lost with him this guy here I mean he I think he died of a heart attack you know just not even very old this guy here the King of Pop where is he now lost many people took arms for these men yeah they took arms they supported them they were this is this this is the guy and they were they took arms but I'm glad that we serve this guy the King of Kings undefeated the all there's a song that says is The alltime Undefeated Undisputed champion of love amen that's who we serve and God chose a little old Ruddy warty looking guy by the name of David with a little sheep skinn coat on him and a slingshot packing in his hand to slay that giant and take over God uses simple things that seem ridiculous in the side of the world he does that to show his great power so little guys follow don't matter how ridiculous it looks follow this guy make this guy the center point of your life cuz this guy is the winner bear armor for this guy amen don't bear armor for nothing else don't matter what it looks like bear armor for this guy am amen I want to just touch on a few little things how about a disloyal armor Bearer you know we get some armor bearers that are disloyal there was a king called a B I believe his name was is that have I got his name right Bible scholars you all you all put your hand up yeah that's [Laughter] me you know it's like that some a lot of people in church don't even read they not here but don't even read their Bible they just you know read it when the pastor reads the two verses and that's it but you know we're not like that we're all Bible scholars so now here now the Lord already had this man aimc because he done some evil things to be to be punished right so then he went and and sieged the city that had these big walls and then there was a lady up on the wall that was part of the fight and she got this big rock and she threw it down and it hit this King he was actually the king it hit him on the head and he was embarrassed because like it was a shame that a woman threw a rock on me and I died and I I sometimes often Marvel how these guys think that on their deathbed wouldn't they think of oh I won't see my family again you know tell my children I love their last thought is oh no a woman threw a rock at me and hit me and and my legacy is going to be that a woman killed me that's what he thought he should have been thinking oh God I'm coming to you it shows what he was shows what was in him yeah Lord Lord here I am I'm going to enter into Glory but no oh a woman thrw a rock at me now I'm going to die so what does he say he turns to his armor Bearer here's here he is there Rock hting Millstone hitting his head then he turns to his armor Bearer he says kill me so that say so that no one says that a rock at me by that a woman threw a rock at me so kill me instead isn't that stupid and we still know what happened to [Laughter] him so he failed then he called hastily unto his young man a AR bear and said draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a woman slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died and when the men of Israel saw that aimik was dead they departed every man into his place now I don't know about this but I don't think that armor bear should have killed his king that's like come on man maybe why don't you at least try and say no I'm going to get you out of here we're going to we're going to try and resuscitate you we're going to try and save you look I to my last breath I'm going to try and help you we just said oh you want to die okay and off he went what sort of an armor beer is that when it when it came down to it kills him that's what that's what you call a disloyal armor Bearer you don't want to you don't want an armor Bearer like that or you don't want to be that sort of armor Bearer you know that when when a when a person you're following doesn't quite work out oh well he's gone down stab him off to the next well let's pick another guy to serve you understand where we're going with this like that's there are people that are like that yeah I'll serve you I'm all for this then when it doesn't quite go their way stab them and off they go to something else disloyal now these are just natural examples I don't want to dwell on these but this guy was the greatest guy out cuz he made electric cars and people thought well this guy's a green making electric cars he's the best thing in the world you know cuz he's going to saved the planet people loved him you know we're going to bear arms for this guy where they were CH championing his cause you know this is just a natural example of how how men and women just turn you know and you know all the news articles about him were just this guy's fantastic he's going to he's going to change the world change the future he's making this car that's going to be electric so we stop all the greenhouse gases and Save the planet you know and then but then he decides to sort of buy a certain uh social media platform and allow any your voices to be there which which his armor bearers didn't like so then they sort of stabbed him oh well that's you done like I'm using this as a silly example but this is it was the same guy making the same cars but no we don't like him anymore and they you know it says here another article he was booed at a comedy show which she says was a first for him in real life you don't like me anymore you know oh he's you know I don't know if I should do this but this these are just these are silly examples but it shows and I don't condone I don't I'm not for any of this sort of stuff I think there's only God's side or Satan side don't get caught up in these other there's not all these other sides but the the I haven't seen any read this book or seen any of these movies you shouldn't but the Harry Potter one everyone loved her until she said that transex like trans woman wasn't a woman now they hate her but but you see they was she was the best thing out and then when it didn't quite go their way you know the thing they were the the the person they were bearing armor for and supporting could easily just turn and and stab them that's what Judas did you know supporting the Lord yeah I'll be with you and then oh when it when it wasn't quite working out and it just he turned and then you know but that's not us because a a true a true armor Bearer for the Lord is loyal yeah you know we we don't just turn we we go go through the thick and through the thin but I put that in there to to say that you know you know some people in the world oh I'm going to be your buddy through thick and thin you know then you go and serve the Lord and suddenly the thick and thin buddies are nowhere to be seen you know turn on your real fast you know cuz it it was never based on anything solid and secure you know this one here is a little bit a little bit sort of uh slightly deeper but but there's a this what I mean it goes a bit deeper when you think about bearing uh taking up arms for a cause like and this this is more a bit more serious but you but you could people can take up a cause for the the gospel of a previous age like a like a Methodist cause or a Luther cause something and it's a it's overall a good cause and they're overall good people but essentially they are still championing for a cause that's not quite going to work at the end even though it's a good cause they they're not they're not overall doing something bad I I'll show you what I mean so so King Saul at one point David was Saul's armor Bearer okay so because Saul was the anointed king and so David was was for him but at a certain point the anointing moved on from Saul okay so so then and then when that happened so did David not that David didn't like Saul but David was following the anointing because he he was there was something greater than just a man he there's there's the anointing but the anointing had left off from Saul and that because the Lord said and the Lord said unto Samuel how long wil thou mourn for Saul seeing how I have rejected him from reigning over Israel so David no longer served him in it and it's not because he was dis loyless he actually he was serving the god in him and if God moved on he moved on and now now he he wouldn't have had animosity because even when he could have killed Saul later on he didn't he didn't kill him he just said look I respect you everything I just I'm just following the Lord and that's what we do I believe that's what brother Colin's done you know with the sometimes when you follow the lord you have to you sometimes get disagreements with people that don't see it the same way you don't just knock him down you say look that's you respect but you say look I'm end of the day I'm going to I'm going to keep moving on and follow this the Christ that I see in the word right you understand because you got to the scenario then there this is this is not so much this this armor Bearer for Saul now he was a good man he was he was cuz Saul was a king of Israel and they were sort of they were wholesome good and and and it it played out when they got to a situation where Saul's rain came to his life came to an end it says and the battle went s against Saul and The Archers hit him and he was sore wounded Over The Archers and then Saul once again said to the armor Bearer draw thy sword and thrust me therewith lest his uncircumcised come and thrust me through through and Abus me but his armor Bearer would not he still had some bit of decency in him he would not yeah we can't do that you know they still stick with it even though it's sort of going down for he was s afraid therefore Saul took his sword and fell upon it and then what did the armor bear do and when his armor bear saw saw that Saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him they still went the same way though he was still championing for a cause that you know that EV that eventually was not going to work out and it's a shame that that at the end time there's going to be weeping and nashing of teeth because they people will say Lord Lord didn't I do all these miracles in your name didn't I serve you didn't I do all this he'll say depart from me I even knew you your worker of iniquity CU they they they were following a saw we an anointing and moved on and they were still trying to fight for that cause it's a very deep thing and a powerful thing but they they at the end they both go down together they both that's the way but but that armor be could have said look I was you know before he went to this battle could have said look I just I I love you I respect you but I sort of want to move on and go with David you know and he could have it was his choice it was his choice to stick with soul see and got a few few more minutes here but but in this day we are we're CH we're called to be two things which is a Loy Royal armor Bearer for the word I I say for the word because it's Christ in our day cuz many people can say Jesus you say which one what Jesus the one that this person explains of him or the one that this person explains I believe the one that brother Brenham explains that Jesus um so we're an armor Bearer for that cause and for and also for his bride for each other we're armor bearers for each other I want to show you an example of a great armor Bearer there was a man called John which was actually Saul's son he was a good man and they came across the camp of the Philistines and Jonathan said to the young man that be his armor come and let us go over unto the Garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few okay and his armor Bearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold I am with thee according to thy heart Lord not my will but thine be done you say move forward we move forward if your word says go here we go there if your word says this we do that wherever you say Lord that's where we go we get because he had absolute confidence in his armor bear that's where we go yep do all that's in your heart then said Jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them when he meant pass over it means they were on one side of this mountain and the Philistines were on the other side and he said what we're going to do is we're going to climb down the cliff we're going to go across the bottom we're going to climb up the other side and then we're going to pop up over the other side and not quite right where they are but we're going to go sort of halfway up enough to sort of see them right on top cuz he figured if we get to there we can sort of get away before they come down or we can go either way from there okay he said if they say thus unto us T until we come to you wait there we'll come down to you we will then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us okay so they're going to walk halfway up the hill hey guys and then they're going to they're going to wait and see what the Philistines say so they're waiting for a word there things have to tie together they've said if it's this we got to wait for this it all has to Dove tail together see they had to know we we've got to be sure what we're following you get where I'm going this the word has to all dovetail together you got to be sure what you're following and when it all ties up together you know right we've got a forward here it all that's why I follow this message because it ties together right that is that it says it in Genesis says it all the way through says it here it all adds up we can move forward amen the Lord's going to give us a victory amen see yes sir and I like this verse and the men of the Garrison answered oh then then it says they they went up a bit further and discovered themselves okay I missed that but out they discovered themselves and it says and the men of the Garrison answered Jonathan and his armor Bearer and said come up to us and we will show you a thing and I'm thinking they're thinking no no we'll show you a thing we'll show you a thing you know they're trying to trick them they said no no the joke's on you we'll show you a thing we're coming up to you and Jonathan said unto his armor Bearer come up after me for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel everything lines up we can go forward the word of God lines up here here we can move forward we're sure of where we're going we know where we stand we've got the word of God it lines up we can claim it we can move forward and these guys no matter the no matter the hardship they climbed up on their hands and knees up this ledge it says and Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armor bear after him climbing up after these guys and they climb up over the top and it says and they they begin to slay these Philistines about the space of about a half an acre and Jonathan and his armor Bearer were there just slaying Philistines probably about three times the distance of this room one after the other because they had a thus sayth the Lord we can move forward and it was Jonathan and his armor Bearer and you know when we have thus sayith the Lord from word from the Lord when we can see ourselves in the word when we can see the promises for us we can move forward together with the Lord because the Lord spoke it we just say Lord then we go forward and we go forward with the Lord I've got one more concept I want to give to you which was which goes a little bit even deeper than than than that because that was kind of following something that that's F but but there's even a concept I think that goes a we bit more deeper than that there's a there's a there's a people that at a certain at a certain time I got two more minutes at a certain time Jehovah the Great great god Jehovah becomes your armor Bearer and that's a powerful thought when you think about it you think oh so this great God's going to become subservient to me and and do what do my bidding my cause cuz an armor Bearer he's waiting if this if the if his King goes that way he goes that way now I got to be careful what I say here but there is this concept Psalm 35 says plead my cause O Lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me he said take hold of shield and Buckler and stand up for my help draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that persecute my soul say persecute me say unto my soul I am thy salvation now when when brother Brenham spoke the squirrels into existence it was a something different happened in that scenario God didn't say to him speak out and say a squirrel will come out of there and onto that one and down onto there and over there he said where do you want the squirrel to go he said you tell me what you want me to do and then he said okay I want it to go there there there and there and he said okay he had if I could put it in a in a respectful term but Jehovah God was at his bidding what whatever he said God would have done wow now there's a when we know we're moving forward in the Lord and we're fighting his cause and we're in his word then then we can call Jehovah God come and fight this battle come and fight this battle with me if we're if we're on the right cause and that's the place of adoption like it's like with David you know I teach them how to lay flaws and then these days I got to admit when I go and I was always the boss for a long time you know I was the boss and he was the young fellow learning learning learning these days he's better than me laid more flaws than me I go there and I'm like okay what do I do man which room do you want me to do you know if I work with them I say where am I going and I don't feel like oh man you know I don't feel small I feel man this is good my son's now he's in charge yep I'll support you what do you want what do you want me to do man I'll support you cuz I know he's he's going to achieve the same thing that I would have achieved and that's where God wants us to get to is he actually wants us to take up the Sword move forward sometimes you go through things you think Lord where's my help why aren't you with me sometimes he just leaves you he says look you've got the sword I can't I can't just go and fight every battle for you you've got to take up the sword yourself and fight by faith now if you really get in trouble I'll be there I'm your armor bear I'll you know you won't fail but you know sometimes we wonder where is God but he's I'm not saying you have to do it to yourself but I'm saying God wants to make warriors out of us and and and he'll be happy when he'll be happy you know I wasn't upset when Dave told me what to do yep where do I go good man let's do this if I could just leave that there but have a think about that because that's the age that we're coming in is that we are adopted Sons and Daughters of God and we we've got the sword of the word in our hand and we know who we are yes we know what our fight is and we only fight in the right way amen praise the Lord that's the thought that I had for you um this evening um so so um I believe you're all loyal armor bearers for the for the for the for the word of God for the Christ of this day and for each other you know look after each other be an arm and Bearer for each other if you you know support each other fight each other's bear each other's burdens you know amen do you want to come up brother Ben or because we're doing the prayer request now yep okay praise the Lord I will um let's just as he's coming up we'll just we'll just close this little
