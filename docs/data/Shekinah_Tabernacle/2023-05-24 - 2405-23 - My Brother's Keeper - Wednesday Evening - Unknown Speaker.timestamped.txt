[26:25] [Music]
[26:46] in your presence
[26:50] [Music]
[26:51] hey Melissa spray this evening
[26:55] what I believe your word said as you
[26:57] were speaking to your disciples that
[26:58] they didn't realize that it was you Lord
[27:00] and then
[27:02] later on they said did not our hearts
[27:04] burned within us as he talked with us
[27:05] along the way
[27:07] Lord and that's the experience that we
[27:08] have when we meet with you Lord we we
[27:11] feel the warmth of your presence Lord
[27:13] and there's that
[27:15] that warmth in our heart Lord that only
[27:16] you can bring Lord that only your spirit
[27:18] can can bring to us and we thank you
[27:20] Lord that we've experienced that this
[27:22] evening we just desire that you would
[27:23] continue to draw close to us Lord
[27:26] tonight and and each day of Our Lives
[27:30] Lord May our hearts just burn with your
[27:32] Holy Ghost Inside of it Lord that that
[27:36] Lord we would be soft and tender and
[27:40] pliable Christians Lord not not get cold
[27:42] and
[27:43] unwatered Lord and cold and hard little
[27:45] but maybe we'd be warm and friendly
[27:46] lighters we listen to the prayer lines
[27:49] that brother Brandon would speak would
[27:51] be speaking and someone would come up
[27:53] and you see he would say I sense that
[27:55] you're a Christian I feel a warm
[27:56] atmosphere around you Lord may that be
[27:58] our testimony when we go amongst people
[28:00] made ourselves since there's a warm
[28:01] atmosphere about you Lord and that's
[28:03] what we want to bring a lot to a cold
[28:05] and Dying World we want to bring the
[28:06] warmth of Jesus Christ to each heart
[28:09] in each life that we come in contact
[28:11] with Lord say we commit the service to
[28:12] you we thank you for the songs thank you
[28:14] for your grace and your presence amongst
[28:16] us this evening we just continue to
[28:17] commit ourselves to you in Jesus name
[28:19] amen amen praise the Lord
[28:22] God bless you all thank you brother
[28:25] um
[28:26] Josh very good thank you for the song
[28:29] um
[28:30] I was listening to the song and I'm
[28:32] thinking I'm not sure how many songs
[28:34] that I've
[28:35] kind of brought to the church as a song
[28:38] but I always got them off um sister
[28:40] annalize she would sing an item and I
[28:42] think man I want to bring that song to
[28:43] the church and then I'd do it in the
[28:44] church so when she was doing that song I
[28:46] thought oh there's another song for me
[28:49] and brother Josh just slipped in there
[28:51] first but I really like that song that
[28:53] was I felt the anointing on it praise
[28:55] the Lord uh if you have your Bibles with
[28:57] you could you please turn to Genesis
[28:59] chapter four
[29:00] um verse 9.
[29:13] Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 says and the
[29:15] Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy
[29:18] brother
[29:19] and he said I know not am I My Brother's
[29:22] Keeper
[29:24] may God bless his word you can have your
[29:25] seats deceiving
[29:27] how are you all doing you're doing good
[29:30] it's good you look good
[29:33] I feel a warm atmosphere
[29:38] this is a prayer meeting tonight so I'm
[29:40] just going to be about
[29:42] 15 minutes
[29:44] maybe 17 if there are some little
[29:47] wind-up statements
[29:51] and Brother Andy insisted that I have no
[29:53] notes
[29:56] so what we just read was my note
[30:00] hahaha
[30:01] and then after that well um just get get
[30:03] the Brethren's request maybe the ones
[30:05] that have been um spoken here that have
[30:08] been sent into the WhatsApp then also if
[30:10] you have any other requests you can
[30:12] um you know speak those out and we can
[30:14] together come and prayer for those needs
[30:17] and those requests so so as I'm speaking
[30:19] don't think too much about that but
[30:20] think about that just a little bit if
[30:21] you have a need there that um you would
[30:24] like the church to pray for because
[30:25] there is great victory in faith and in
[30:28] Brethren praying and believing
[30:30] so you know one will chase a thousand
[30:32] and two ten thousand
[30:34] so our prayers when we get together to
[30:36] pray for something are effective
[30:39] um and I believe we're all believers so
[30:40] there's just a Powerhouse of faith that
[30:42] goes forth and makes a difference so I
[30:44] want to make sure we have time that you
[30:46] could
[30:47] share the needs and also then we can we
[30:49] can gather them in our mind and then
[30:51] take the burden of them you know it's
[30:52] effective when we
[30:54] take the burden on when we get inside
[30:56] the need of whatever that request was if
[30:59] we just parrot it off and say Lord bless
[31:01] this one that had this need and that one
[31:02] that had that needed that one that they
[31:03] had that need we may be better off just
[31:05] just seeing which one affects our heart
[31:08] like if there was someone in a hospital
[31:09] we think you know what I've been there I
[31:11] know what it's like to be sitting in a
[31:12] hospital bed with maybe that same
[31:13] particular sickness and I know how hard
[31:16] it was and I know that that may be a
[31:18] prayer for me would have been good and
[31:20] like this sort of prayer would have been
[31:21] good for me at that time so we can enter
[31:22] into the burden of her if there's a
[31:24] certain need so so see which one touches
[31:26] your heart and then lay hold of that one
[31:28] because maybe that's the one the Lord
[31:29] wants you to pray for because your faith
[31:31] will meet that need if you have a burden
[31:33] for it you know it's a bit harder to
[31:35] pray for something if you don't have a
[31:36] burden for it Although our words will be
[31:38] effective
[31:39] because the word of God and our what we
[31:41] speak is still powerful but you know
[31:42] when we when we come with a burden it's
[31:44] like we enter into it and we we we can
[31:47] pray so let's let's do it like that
[31:50] um they thought that I had tonight was a
[31:53] thought called I Am My Brother's Keeper
[31:57] I am My Brother's Keeper and I'm going
[32:00] to make this General so brother means
[32:03] sister as well is that all right yeah
[32:05] good we could say I am My Sister's
[32:08] Keeper I'm My Brother's Keeper but
[32:10] because the Bible says brother you know
[32:11] we just sat and he was talking to Cain
[32:14] uh Cain said that to God actually but
[32:16] we're just going to say brother but
[32:17] sisters it means sisters as well so I
[32:19] have my sisters keeper I'm My Brother's
[32:20] Keeper
[32:21] and
[32:23] I didn't quite know what I was going to
[32:25] speak about until maybe about an hour
[32:27] before coming here
[32:28] and the thought just came up I am My
[32:31] Brother's Keeper and I thought it was
[32:33] quite applicable in my current situation
[32:36] because I literally am My Brother's
[32:38] Keeper laughs
[32:40] Hello Joel
[32:45] but I think I actually have a word for
[32:46] the church this evening
[32:48] and I think it's more than just
[32:50] a coincidental series of events but I
[32:54] think that the Lord is calling us to be
[32:55] our Brother's Keeper
[32:57] and I believe this is from the Lord that
[32:58] that something the Lord wants to speak
[33:00] to you and to me this evening that this
[33:03] is the Lord's heart
[33:05] okay so take it as being from the Lord
[33:07] because I I believe that it is and I
[33:09] believe it's the season that we actually
[33:10] are going to enter into more becoming
[33:12] our brother and our sisters keeper as we
[33:14] see darkness and and things approaching
[33:16] on us it's more important now than ever
[33:19] that we are our brother's keeper and we
[33:21] are our sisters keeper
[33:22] there has never been an onslaught that
[33:25] we are experiencing and that we will
[33:26] continue to experience like there is now
[33:29] in the history of
[33:30] brothers and sisters being upon the face
[33:32] of this Earth the the onslaught that
[33:34] we're going to face and we will be our
[33:36] brothers and sisters keeper and and I
[33:40] don't believe that I think life will be
[33:42] very hard for us if we don't have a
[33:44] brother or sister keeping us
[33:46] I believe that's the time that we are
[33:48] stepping into
[33:49] but that's the time that the law monster
[33:51] system step into you know there's a big
[33:53] fight at the moment against communism
[33:55] around the world because they can see
[33:57] communism creeping in but we're actually
[33:59] all Communists you know that yes
[34:01] we're actually all Communists the book
[34:04] of Acts they said they had all things in
[34:06] common
[34:07] we're actually all Communists really and
[34:09] the true sense of the word
[34:12] we don't have the nonsense of this
[34:14] worldly way they do it but actually they
[34:17] were communists and they they sold
[34:19] everything they had they gave it all and
[34:20] then they distributed it as each
[34:22] Brethren brother or sister had need they
[34:24] were Communists and that was how God
[34:26] actually formed the church then
[34:28] that's right yeah see
[34:32] we don't do life like that we do it it's
[34:34] me me it's mine what's mine is mine
[34:36] what's yours is yours but the Bible says
[34:38] look not every man on his own things but
[34:40] every man on the things of others
[34:42] that's right and and that doesn't just
[34:45] mean Goods that means actually what
[34:48] about their need what about their what
[34:49] about what they want yeah
[34:51] we often will try and get ahead of
[34:52] someone else because we want that
[34:53] position
[34:54] what about if that person wants a
[34:56] position why not let them have it yeah
[34:57] yeah it's the same thing you see it's
[34:59] it's being your brother's keeper and
[35:01] caring for them and and so starting off
[35:03] back with with Joel I
[35:06] I don't think it's coincidental that
[35:07] that I've actually become his the lord
[35:10] has laid it upon me to become his keeper
[35:12] in the season and he won't mind me
[35:14] saying this because
[35:16] I feel privileged that that the Lord
[35:18] would
[35:19] say to me I want you to be his keeper
[35:21] you know he shared with me the other day
[35:22] that he was
[35:23] when I said hey maybe you could come and
[35:26] live at the factory and we could get you
[35:27] get you there and get the courts to
[35:29] allow you to be there
[35:30] he said he prayed about it over a few
[35:32] days and he said all he kept on getting
[35:34] was my name coming up in manawatu you
[35:37] know over a couple of days so
[35:39] the that that was encouraging to me
[35:42] because it felt you we feel like
[35:43] actually the Lord's in all this you know
[35:46] and and the Lord is actually in that
[35:48] instance calling me to be My Brother's
[35:51] Keeper
[35:52] and
[35:53] I don't think I'm going to tell you
[35:55] something else that's happened in over
[35:57] the last week or so but it's along this
[35:58] same lines of
[36:01] being our Brother's Keeper
[36:03] I want to start I want to just this
[36:05] little thought
[36:08] emphasized it to me can you put up that
[36:10] photo I had a photo there that
[36:12] I just I'm not going to talk about this
[36:14] but I just want to talk about something
[36:16] because Shannon said to me the other day
[36:18] she said it's amazing how much the devil
[36:20] is attacking the world at the moment
[36:22] mankind she said mankind Christian or
[36:25] non-Christian Satan is just attacking
[36:28] like is attacking the world financially
[36:30] at the moment he's attacking the world
[36:32] physically with health with everything
[36:34] he's actually attacking the world
[36:36] and that got me thinking I thought
[36:38] that's actually a quite a powerful
[36:40] statement that yes Satan is actually he
[36:42] hates all of us he hates human beings he
[36:45] hates them all and he especially hates
[36:47] the Sons and Daughters of God with a
[36:49] pure hatred and he is attacking
[36:51] now more than ever
[36:55] so these two people here this was 2001
[36:57] and they were having an interview
[37:00] one was a
[37:02] news a journalist who was
[37:06] his views were this way and one was a a
[37:09] very respected uh doctor and a very
[37:12] popular doctor that was
[37:14] um
[37:15] against people getting vaccinated and
[37:17] against the vaccine itself right he was
[37:19] on that camp so so these two and the
[37:21] other guy was very much opposed to his
[37:23] belief so this was a very quite a
[37:25] uh
[37:27] uh and an intense interview with two
[37:29] opposing views clashing head to head on
[37:33] quite a public network and this this
[37:34] this man the the man with the
[37:38] um paper as the journalist the other man
[37:39] was the
[37:41] um
[37:42] the man the doctor he became very very
[37:45] popular because he was he put forward
[37:47] opinions early in the piece to say this
[37:49] is something's going wrong here we
[37:50] shouldn't be doing this as doctors you
[37:51] know the way they're rushing things
[37:52] through and that
[37:53] the the point that the reason why I'm
[37:57] showing you all this is because that was
[37:58] October
[37:59] 2021
[38:01] and and uh what do we have now may 2023
[38:06] was that two and a half years later both
[38:08] of those men are dead
[38:11] I look at that and I think this is
[38:13] strange both those men are dead these
[38:15] men are not old men these are just these
[38:18] are healthy men they look reasonably
[38:19] healthy
[38:21] now
[38:22] one man was actually fighting a bit of a
[38:24] battle with cancer the the journalist
[38:27] but there is suspicion that you know you
[38:28] take this thing it makes your cancer Go
[38:30] funny but the the the point is both
[38:33] these men are dead
[38:35] that this is not normal
[38:37] like we look around there's things
[38:40] happening that are not normal there's a
[38:41] there's an attack on the world this
[38:44] other man insisted that he was poisoned
[38:46] because he was becoming so powerful and
[38:48] what he was saying he was poisoned and
[38:49] he recovered from that then he got
[38:51] poisoned again and he's dead
[38:52] it's
[38:54] we we we're at a time where we're under
[38:57] attack
[38:58] intensely
[39:00] yeah and
[39:01] we need to be our brothers and our
[39:03] Sister's Keeper at this time
[39:07] this is unusual man you can take that
[39:09] down now this is just that that just
[39:12] sort of when I thought about that I
[39:13] thought what a strange world that we
[39:15] live in when when I just I can watch an
[39:17] interview now and then I get news oh
[39:19] that man is dead
[39:21] he did that's a that's a serious thing
[39:22] he's dead people don't just die
[39:27] you understand like we are we're at a
[39:30] time where we're
[39:32] I think we're going to be under attack
[39:34] like we've never been under attack
[39:36] before spiritually
[39:38] you've probably all been under attack
[39:39] this week spiritually you'll experience
[39:41] that more and more and more
[39:44] and and what can I do to help you I can
[39:46] encourage you and the Lord I can
[39:47] encourage you in your faith you know
[39:48] when you're being attacked spiritually I
[39:50] can I can encourage you see words are
[39:52] powerful I can I can I can share
[39:53] testimonies with you I can I can testify
[39:56] of how the Lord deliver me and what it
[39:57] does is that it helps your faith to
[39:59] increase yeah
[40:00] you know I can pray for you you can
[40:02] sometimes come away from fellowship with
[40:04] a brother or a sister when you may be
[40:05] feeling quite down then they share
[40:07] testimonies and encourage you and it
[40:08] strengthens your faith and you come away
[40:10] strong you were your brothers or sisters
[40:12] keeper when you do that to them
[40:14] you were the keeper and when you're when
[40:16] you're down the same they can do the
[40:17] same to you yeah yeah or when you when
[40:19] you pray when they don't know about it
[40:20] but you pray and you know you sometimes
[40:22] just feel like well I just done I've
[40:23] started to feel good all of a sudden I'm
[40:25] not sure why someone was praying for you
[40:26] yeah
[40:27] we can't just go about our lives as like
[40:30] oh this is just me and I just do my
[40:31] thing I think the battle is hot and
[40:33] heavy that we must be our brother and
[40:35] our Sister's Keeper
[40:36] I know we have to battle ourselves but
[40:39] I think we should be become more of our
[40:42] brother and our Sister's Keeper and
[40:44] amen and
[40:46] so that's the thought that I've been
[40:47] pondering
[40:49] um
[40:50] and just thinking about as even as I see
[40:52] economic ties becoming quite tough and
[40:54] things happening I'm like I think we
[40:55] need to become each other's keeper a bit
[40:57] more you know we can't just leave
[40:58] everyone to it oh they're just you'll be
[40:59] right see here you go
[41:02] you understand we have to become
[41:05] and so I started to get this thought not
[41:08] just for us here but then I started the
[41:10] Lord started to sort of put it more in a
[41:12] I guess I'm not big enough yet to think
[41:14] National because my International my
[41:16] mind can't really my mind sort of goes
[41:19] to our beaches and stops there
[41:21] sorry I've got brothers from South
[41:22] Africa and Canada and America but I kind
[41:25] of I guess at the beach and it doesn't
[41:26] go any further than that you know I
[41:29] don't have a big enough boat to sort of
[41:30] sail over
[41:31] so so
[41:33] some other brothers think Global you
[41:35] know but I I can't do that yet the Lord
[41:37] maybe will take me along but you know I
[41:39] started to think not just with us
[41:42] because we are an independent Body of
[41:44] Christ there we our job is to help each
[41:45] other you know you if you've got a you
[41:48] have a need I'm going to try and meet
[41:49] your need however I can and you vice
[41:51] versa to me and you know that's what we
[41:53] do here as Believers we and and we're
[41:55] communal right we work
[41:59] with each other and
[42:02] then
[42:04] a a situation came up
[42:07] where
[42:09] um
[42:10] someone in another church raised the
[42:12] need that this this brother in the
[42:14] church needed a certain thing that that
[42:16] the church couldn't provide it it would
[42:17] be like brother Ben saying to another
[42:20] church hey I've got a brother here that
[42:21] needs something like we can't quite
[42:22] provide him this need in the church
[42:24] could you help out
[42:25] okay and and that that need came forward
[42:29] reached
[42:30] our little ears you know that this this
[42:32] brother had said there's a brother in
[42:33] the church that there's got this need
[42:34] that he needs something and and that got
[42:36] me thinking I thought this is an
[42:38] interesting situation because I knew the
[42:40] brothers and that and I thought
[42:42] I thought
[42:44] okay so what happens in that situation
[42:45] like do when the little Fellowship can't
[42:49] sort of look after one of their not that
[42:52] they come but they go through different
[42:53] seasons and they they can't meet a
[42:55] certain need and they put the word out
[42:57] then whose responsibility who was that
[42:59] Brother's Keeper then
[43:00] because they try and in the little group
[43:03] they're like well I'm I'm your keeper
[43:04] but if they can't do it they if that
[43:06] need comes out before
[43:07] outside of their chest and who is that
[43:09] Brother's Keeper and I thought to myself
[43:11] I thought actually
[43:13] then if I just go into the confines of
[43:16] this country I think well then we're all
[43:17] our Brother's Keeper
[43:19] so so then I thought I don't know if
[43:21] you're just going to come to the need
[43:22] for us to meet that need what about all
[43:24] the other churches
[43:26] are we not all Brethren and I wasn't to
[43:29] be like well if I will give if they give
[43:30] it's more like well hang on we need to
[43:32] look at this in a different way
[43:34] if once he comes out to the to an end to
[43:37] a national sort of scenario it's like
[43:39] then he's all of our problem
[43:41] he's not just my brother he's the other
[43:43] churches he's your brother too we're all
[43:46] our Brother's Keeper can't we make
[43:48] something that we all then know about
[43:50] this need and we can all try and meet
[43:52] the need because when it comes outside
[43:54] of the local church it's it's my problem
[43:56] but it's your problem is your problem
[43:57] he's the whole country's problem
[43:59] I understand it's not just like oh we
[44:01] just asked for our walls and no more no
[44:03] this we're all in the same team we're
[44:05] all in the same battle and God happened
[44:07] to have put us on these two islands
[44:08] three four if you can't wake you five if
[44:11] you count the barrier
[44:13] we're all here together
[44:15] reasonably isolated and we need to work
[44:17] together and I don't know if you've
[44:18] noticed during the in the conventions of
[44:20] late over the past few years there's
[44:22] been a real togetherness you know
[44:24] and a willingness to work together and
[44:26] to to gather and to actually help each
[44:29] other out and and ministers are coming
[44:31] through and going traveling around we
[44:32] sort of we're working together and it's
[44:34] been such a nice feeling and so when
[44:37] that need came up down there I thought
[44:38] well hang on it shouldn't just be just
[44:40] asking us for help why don't we ask all
[44:42] these other brothers for help too like
[44:43] hey bro this guy this brother needs some
[44:46] help from that Fellowship can we help
[44:48] and then
[44:50] then we started to to
[44:53] I've got about five minutes to go but I
[44:55] want to share this with you because I
[44:56] think the Lord is doing something
[44:58] exciting in our midst that
[45:00] on with this intention that it's
[45:02] actually to serve
[45:04] not to be anything but to serve and help
[45:07] they say Christian's job is to serve and
[45:09] help if you've got any other intention
[45:11] you're not signed up to the right team
[45:14] because the Lord's team are servants he
[45:17] said the greatest among you shall be
[45:18] your servant
[45:20] okay so we're all servants that's what
[45:21] our that's what our role is so
[45:25] then I thought after that I thought
[45:27] making the making the picture a little
[45:29] bit bigger I thought well then hang on
[45:31] this like if if we can work together
[45:33] like that what about what about if
[45:35] there's other churches that have young
[45:36] ministers that maybe if the purpose use
[45:38] that week after week after week because
[45:39] the way it should be you know because
[45:41] the past that brings the word can't we
[45:44] make a little special meeting here and
[45:45] bring some of these ministers down to be
[45:46] able to
[45:47] get them use their sword and learn to
[45:50] minister and you know like we will not
[45:52] we won't have seasoned Ministers of the
[45:54] Gospel if we don't let them preach the
[45:55] gospel
[45:56] you know like and if these brothers are
[45:58] preaching only twice a year
[46:00] and we then that'll take them
[46:03] 10 years every 10 years they get 20
[46:05] sermons does my mass correct I mean
[46:07] that's that's not that many right to
[46:09] really and then and then we want to hold
[46:10] these big meetings then we wonder why we
[46:12] haven't got a pool of people to draw
[46:13] from because
[46:14] we haven't given we haven't worked
[46:16] together but I think I am My Brother's
[46:18] Keeper I want to make an opportunity for
[46:20] these brothers to why can't we make why
[46:23] can't we work together to actually help
[46:25] them train up and to to learn to use
[46:27] their sword if we have to sit through a
[46:28] few sermons The Bomb then sit through
[46:29] them yes
[46:31] these brothers might think hey that's
[46:32] the last one I thought I'm not called to
[46:33] it then we're happy with that but if
[46:35] they're just learning let them learn let
[46:36] them grow
[46:37] and then
[46:39] and then it then eventually we're going
[46:41] to have people that can use the sword
[46:42] that can actually go forth with the word
[46:44] of God but but we are our Brother's
[46:47] Keeper we can't just uh what's you you
[46:49] oh that little church up there your
[46:50] ministers are your problem well no
[46:51] they're actually my problem because
[46:52] we're on the same team
[46:54] it's not just your problem it's my
[46:55] problem I want your I want your brothers
[46:57] and your sisters you I want you guys to
[46:59] increase I want you if you do well I do
[47:02] well we're on the same team here if
[47:04] you're if you prosper I prosper
[47:07] you understand we're we're all
[47:09] Communists here you know we have all
[47:11] things in common your ministers are my
[47:13] ministers
[47:14] and our ministers are your ministers
[47:16] that that's the way way we work and and
[47:19] as they get as they as they move on
[47:22] maybe some of the some of these
[47:23] ministers can help look after the home
[47:24] front well some of the Season ministers
[47:26] going on on the mission field more and
[47:28] go and do more of that work and and
[47:29] actually it brings Souls overseas and
[47:31] that that that there's there's countries
[47:33] I mean we heard reports from Brother
[47:36] these countries that is crying out for
[47:38] the gospel to just to go there you know
[47:40] yeah and and if we don't have ministers
[47:42] here to send there but other season
[47:44] ministers and other churches well let's
[47:45] give to them you go
[47:47] it's our prop that this is all our
[47:49] problem this is uh oh you can't afford
[47:51] to seeing your minister I work yes they
[47:52] can't go
[47:54] but but if we have what but if but you
[47:58] going there is my problem
[47:59] because those people there that need the
[48:01] gospel is my problem
[48:03] it's it's all about problem I am My
[48:06] Brother's Keeper if you can't get there
[48:08] then that's my problem I'm your keeper
[48:10] how what can we do to help you to get
[48:12] there you understand yeah so
[48:16] so we were um
[48:19] I think were you and I talking about
[48:21] this on the drive up we were Brother
[48:23] Andy and I we went to up north last week
[48:26] um on Monday to just do some things up
[48:28] at brother Malcolm's and around about
[48:30] and we were discussing these things on
[48:31] the way up how it would be so nice to
[48:33] that that we could all work together
[48:34] more and that the gospel could go
[48:36] forward with the intention of the Gospel
[48:38] moving forward
[48:39] and
[48:41] and with the express purpose of I Am My
[48:43] Brother's Keeper
[48:44] and
[48:45] and we were just sitting around
[48:46] fellowshipping with brother Malcolm and
[48:48] we just happened to you know late into
[48:49] the night as you usually do with
[48:51] Brothers we just happened to share a few
[48:52] of these things we said oh wouldn't it
[48:54] be nice if we brought up the situation
[48:55] with the brother and they had the need
[48:56] and I basically went through what I
[48:58] talked to you now about like wouldn't it
[49:00] be nice if we worked together more on
[49:01] the fellow the churches work together
[49:03] and we you know we could we all be we
[49:05] all looked after each other and
[49:06] and he said brother I've been want to do
[49:08] that for years
[49:09] Years brother let's do this
[49:12] brother Malcolm you kind of he's a bit
[49:14] like Brother Andy you sort of give him a
[49:17] no I'm going to take that back I think
[49:19] he felt like it was the leading of the
[49:20] Lord
[49:21] he said he said brother that this is of
[49:23] the Lord I've wanted to do this for
[49:24] years I think it's time we need to get
[49:26] this moving
[49:27] we thought we thought oh he'll be maybe
[49:29] six months and he'll have another
[49:30] reconvene about it he said let's think
[49:32] about it for a day and we'll talk about
[49:34] it again tomorrow it's like 20 he said
[49:36] 24 hours I'm like man this guy now we're
[49:40] talking he's that kind of guy man gets
[49:43] things done
[49:44] but he he said that's been a burden on
[49:46] my heart that we'll work together and
[49:48] and he wants to go overseas a lot but
[49:50] he's here it's just hard to yeah the
[49:51] pool of people to go to help and do
[49:53] things that he just runs out of resource
[49:54] he said oh we just can't end up going
[49:56] because we don't have the
[49:58] so
[49:59] the
[50:01] he just said let's let's do this and I
[50:03] well then about with the with the basis
[50:07] of this desire well then about a maybe a
[50:10] week there was a there's been a chat
[50:13] start with about almost most of the
[50:16] ministers and the pastors the majority
[50:19] all around the whole country are on now
[50:20] a chat and there's going to be a meeting
[50:22] on Friday
[50:24] to
[50:26] to to to to actually be our Brother's
[50:29] Keeper
[50:31] and and to actually support each other
[50:34] and help each other and and realizing
[50:36] we're in a we're in the thick of a
[50:37] battle here we can't just go it alone
[50:38] and argue to do it you you do your thing
[50:40] I do I think no man we're in the flick
[50:41] of battery we need to
[50:43] we actually need to work together
[50:44] brothers and sisters we this is an
[50:46] onslaught man yeah
[50:47] yeah it's an onslaught and and I'm not
[50:50] going to stand up and say we don't need
[50:51] anyone I stand up and say man I need all
[50:53] the help I can get like I've been under
[50:55] so much like the battle's Raging against
[50:57] me help me all you can man
[51:00] and vice versa if I can help you I will
[51:03] and and I don't know I believe that the
[51:06] Lord is in it so I think there's just
[51:07] something happening with the and the
[51:09] intention is to serve and to help and to
[51:12] edify each other
[51:14] so not only are we all our brothers and
[51:17] sisters keep it here but I think
[51:18] nationally we are all our brothers and
[51:20] sisters keepers
[51:21] and and we we and and I think the Lord
[51:23] is
[51:25] you know I I feel there's a Unity
[51:27] amongst the Brethren the Lord said how
[51:29] good and pleasant it is for the Brethren
[51:30] to dwell together in unity
[51:32] it's like the world that ran down
[51:34] Aaron's head and down his bed and down
[51:37] to the skirts of His Garment
[51:39] we were talking about that the other day
[51:41] when we were following up oil on the
[51:42] Chain so I think it was brother Ben he
[51:43] was putting oil in the chamber oil and
[51:45] it was going and he was he I think he
[51:47] did it too fast and it went all over the
[51:49] side and down on the blade and all on
[51:51] the ground and we said that's likely
[51:52] your anointing oil of Aaron
[51:55] we said he was a real spiritual brother
[51:57] you know
[51:58] he's caught the anointing
[52:01] that was um so that was my little
[52:03] thought that I had
[52:04] but I believe it's the mind of Christ
[52:06] that we are our brother's keeper and
[52:08] it's the time where we come into more of
[52:10] that in our mind and and don't just look
[52:12] at your own things look on the things of
[52:14] others care about them sometimes I've
[52:16] given so much and everything I look at
[52:18] my own
[52:20] some in my resource my own heart
[52:21] everything and I say Lord I'm empty
[52:23] amiti
[52:25] but you know and I somehow sometimes
[52:28] used to think that was bad
[52:29] but when you look at it this way
[52:34] why is it bad
[52:37] if someone else says that you don't have
[52:38] it
[52:40] the lord gave everything when he took
[52:42] his last breath that was the last but he
[52:43] that was the last thing you had
[52:46] and he was done he gave every single
[52:49] thing for us to have everything yeah
[52:51] and we something I think it's bad we we
[52:53] end up oh this is not right I've ended
[52:55] up with nothing and
[52:56] he's got something she's got something
[52:59] what's bad about that
[53:01] that's the gospel
[53:04] amen now we say oh the Lord will
[53:05] replenished it he does but you don't
[53:07] just do it because you get replenished
[53:08] you do it because you do it
[53:11] we give
[53:13] praise the Lord let's um I'm going to
[53:15] close that thought there
[53:18] um now pray requests
