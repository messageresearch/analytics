[41:38] number 18 the Bible here says wherefore
[41:42] my beloved as ye have always obeyed not
[41:45] in as in my presence only but now much
[41:48] more in my absence Paul says work out
[41:52] your own salvation with fear and

[42:05] murmurings and
[42:07] disputings that you be blameless and
[42:10] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[42:14] now notice here what what Paul is saying
[42:16] he's asking them to be blameless and to
[42:19] be harmless to be the sons of God
[42:22] without rebuke and notice the condition
[42:24] that they're going to be this in in the
[42:27] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[42:30] among whom you shine as lights in the
[42:33] world holding forth the Word of Life
[42:37] yeah that I may rejoice in the day of
[42:38] Christ that I have not run in vain
[42:41] neither labored in vain and yay and if I

[42:46] service of your faith I joy and rejoice
[42:49] with you all for the same calls also do
[42:52] you Joy and rejoice with me we just ask
[42:56] the Lord this evening to add the
[42:57] blessing to the reading of his word as
[42:59] you may have your seats for just a few
[43:01] moments I I I understand it's a midweek
[43:04] service but I am so thankful that the
[43:06] Lord meets with us on midweek Services
[43:09] amen I tell you sometimes it's a midweek
[43:12] service that gets us through the week
[43:13] amen amen I want to by the help of the
[43:16] Lord to speak to here for just a few
[43:19] moments upon a thought and if I would
[43:21] title it I would like to speak to you on
[43:23] holding forth the word of life amen amen
[43:27] holding forth the word of life and I'll
[43:29] tell you tonight I am thankful and I am
[43:31] thankful to God that we have a Bible
[43:34] aren't you I'm thankful that we've got a
[43:36] Bible but I'm not just thankful that
[43:37] we've got a Bible but I'm thankful that
[43:40] we've got a Divine commentary on the
[43:42] Bible that we have I'm thankful to know
[43:44] tonight that the Bible amen is not just
[43:47] a history book the Bible is not just a a
[43:50] newspaper article it's not it's not
[43:52] something that's just a myth but the
[43:54] Bible amen is the word of God and
[43:56] brother tells us that for many years
[43:59] they've had this Bible and they've tried
[44:00] to understand this Bible he said but it
[44:03] is a Divine promise that in the last
[44:05] days there will come a perfect
[44:07] understanding of the Bible that we have
[44:09] so aren't you thankful to be a people
[44:11] tonight who is not looking at the Bible
[44:13] amen Through The Eyes of denomination
[44:15] you're not looking through the Bible
[44:17] Through The Eyes of some man's
[44:19] understanding but you're looking at the
[44:20] Bible Through The Eyes of the pillar of
[44:22] fire said see he said I might pass this
[44:25] on to you young people do you know that
[44:27] Abraham Lincoln never owned a book in
[44:29] his life until he was 21 years old he
[44:32] said the only book that he owned was the
[44:34] Bible and Fox's book of the Martyr see
[44:37] what you read molds the character that
[44:39] you are so when brother is telling us
[44:41] this he's telling us this for a purpose
[44:43] that what you're reading is what you are
[44:45] becoming he said see no wonder that
[44:47] we've got a bunch of neurotics today
[44:49] little old fiction magazines and vulgar
[44:52] and nonsense is placed up on our new
[44:54] stands he said see he only owned the
[44:56] Bible and the the foxes books the
[44:59] martyrs and look what it made him so
[45:01] actually what he's declaring here amen
[45:03] is the book that Abraham lincol is what
[45:05] made him the man that he was and I I'll
[45:08] tell you if Abraham Lincoln amen could
[45:10] read the Bible amen and could become one
[45:12] of the greatest presidents to ever go
[45:14] down in history he can become one of the
[45:16] greatest politicians Amen to ever stand
[45:19] and and to declare the things of a
[45:21] country I think if there's a bride on
[45:23] the earth tonight and then I think if
[45:25] we're reading this same then there is
[45:27] more potential in this building Amen to
[45:30] become more than just a politician amen
[45:32] there is potential to become more than
[45:34] just a church member but there is a
[45:36] potential here Amen to become the very
[45:39] Seed of Abraham and the Bible says the
[45:41] Seed of Abraham shall possess the gate
[45:44] amen of every enemy brother ran was
[45:46] praying in a message and getting in the
[45:47] spirit he said Heavenly Father we are in
[45:49] a perishing land we are in a perishing
[45:52] Nation he said we're in a perishing
[45:54] world and we're preaching to perishing
[45:55] people he said but I'm just a man and
[45:58] these other preachers are just men but
[46:00] you are an imperishable God what a what
[46:03] a reality that is to know that we're
[46:05] living Amen in a generation where the
[46:07] nation that we're living in is perishing
[46:09] amen the country we're living in is
[46:11] perishing amen the people around us are
[46:14] perishing religion is perishing but we
[46:16] have got a God here tonight amen and
[46:19] he's not a perishing God but he's an
[46:21] eternal God and he's got eternal power I
[46:24] to think tonight that that imperishable
[46:27] God Is Not A Million Miles Away he's not
[46:30] a million planets away but he's right
[46:32] here in this building tonight to declare
[46:34] himself amen the same yesterday today
[46:36] and forever he said I pray thee tonight
[46:39] Lord that this message I have spoken my
[46:41] nerve is six months of going around and
[46:43] being wound up he said I might have not
[46:45] said it just right Lord brother's
[46:47] preaching a message on getting in the
[46:49] spirit now what a great important thing
[46:51] he was preaching because the greatest
[46:53] thing the church needs is not to get
[46:56] into education
[46:57] it's not to get into the Realms of
[46:59] formality but the greatest thing that
[47:01] the Church of the Living God needs is to
[47:04] move beyond the Realms of just human
[47:06] intellectualism move beyond the Realms
[47:08] of just church ideas and move into the
[47:10] reals where there's a supernatural God
[47:13] and he's got Supernatural power I to
[47:15] think tonight that a prophet said I may
[47:17] have made a mess out of this but there's
[47:19] going to be a church who is going to
[47:21] move into the spirit of almighty God he
[47:24] said the holy spirit is here and said
[47:27] let that Spirit just smooth it out amen
[47:29] and take all the wrinkles out God just
[47:31] like you did to Abraham and said we know
[47:34] he had his frustration so we understand
[47:37] here amen that the Bible is a book that
[47:39] is full amen of people who made
[47:43] mistakes the Bible is full of people
[47:46] amen who was constantly falling short of
[47:48] the glory of God and a prophet picked
[47:50] that up and Christ revealed in his own
[47:52] word and he said see if this was a book
[47:54] of a man he said they would have not
[47:57] allowed their mistakes Amen to be put in
[47:59] a book and to think that this book has
[48:01] been around the world Amen this book has
[48:04] been on conents this book has been in
[48:06] King's offices this book has been all
[48:08] over the world and it's full amen of
[48:11] people who made mistakes amen but it did
[48:13] not stop there it is full of people who
[48:16] did not let their mistakes overcome them
[48:19] but they took the faith of Jesus Christ
[48:21] that was on the inside of their hearts
[48:24] amen and they overcame by the blood of
[48:26] the lamb and by the word of their
[48:27] testimony brother if you're looking for
[48:29] a perfect Church look no further she's
[48:31] here tonight you say how can you say
[48:34] that because we may be humans and we may
[48:36] have frustrations amen but we've got a
[48:39] perfect atonement tonight and that
[48:41] atonement declares that greater is he
[48:43] that is in you than he that is in the
[48:46] world and if God be for us then who can
[48:48] be against us now to think tonight just
[48:51] like Abraham we've had frustrations the
[48:53] Bible says that Abraham was a man and he
[48:56] was full of frustrations anybody ever
[48:58] get mad anybody ever get upset anybody
[49:01] ever go through something and you feel
[49:03] like you're the furthest thing from a
[49:05] Christian amen but can I tell you
[49:06] tonight the thing you're going through
[49:08] has not got the power to take your
[49:11] identity away from you see your identity
[49:14] is not coming from the atmosphere you're
[49:16] living in your identity is coming from a
[49:19] seed that was placed on the inside of
[49:21] your heart and it wasn't placed there
[49:23] yesterday it wasn't placed there at an
[49:25] altar it was placed there from before
[49:27] the foundation of the world my to think
[49:30] tonight that Abraham the Bible says that
[49:32] Abraham's tiggered amen you go back and
[49:35] read it the Bible says that Abraham
[49:37] doubted amen but when the New Covenant
[49:39] came amen Abraham's frustration amen
[49:42] could not come in that new my God
[49:46] Abraham's frustrations and Abraham's
[49:48] failures amen could not come into the
[49:50] Divine commentary and a prophet of God
[49:52] said a man who had one time staggered at
[49:54] the promise of God the faith of Jesus
[49:57] Christ overcame the things of Abraham
[50:00] and it's not even recorded the Bible
[50:02] says Abraham grew stronger as he fed
[50:05] upon the promise he said so Lord God my
[50:08] little styring and my little misspelled
[50:10] words and my little mispronounced and so
[50:13] forth let the Holy Spirit just smooth it
[50:15] out and put a real Divine commentary in
[50:18] every heart of this message tonight he
[50:20] said and let him see that there's still
[50:22] a God who is alive and he's well tonight
[50:25] do you see what the the power of the
[50:27] word can do the power of the word can
[50:29] smooth out amen it can erase the things
[50:32] of Our Lives by to think tonight there
[50:34] still remains of people in spite of
[50:37] failures who loves God and there still
[50:40] remains of people tonight in spite of
[50:42] all the things you've been through you
[50:44] still love God and there is still a God
[50:47] who is interested in you there is a
[50:49] savior that was smitten some 2,000 years
[50:52] ago he was wounded for our transgression
[50:55] he was bruised for our iniquity it and
[50:57] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[50:59] him and with his stripes amen we are
[51:03] healed see this is not something coming
[51:05] in the future this is something that's
[51:08] already been done it's just waiting for
[51:10] the faith amen of a son or daughter of
[51:12] God Amen to rise to a level amen I'll
[51:15] tell you what tonight church it's not
[51:17] time to sit there it's time to move it's
[51:20] not time to be bound it's time to move
[51:22] into the liberty of Jesus Christ we are
[51:25] not a bunch of defeated people
[51:27] we are not a bunch of defeated
[51:28] Christians we have got a perfect lamb
[51:30] who has produced a perfect blood and
[51:32] it's going to produce a Perfect Bride
[51:34] and there ain't enough devils and all of
[51:36] hell that is going to stop this church
[51:39] amen from rising in the power of the
[51:41] Holy
[51:43] Ghost I tell you tonight in Hebrews
[51:45] chapter 8 the Bible says for finding
[51:47] fault with him he saith behold the days
[51:50] cometh sayith the Lord when I will make
[51:52] a New Covenant amen with the house of
[51:54] Israel and with the house Judah what is
[51:57] that word Judah the word Judah means
[52:00] praise huh I ain't even got time to
[52:02] preach there amen the word Judah means
[52:04] praise do you realize the Bible tells us
[52:07] that there was a man by the name of
[52:09] Daniel Amen who was thrown in the Lion's
[52:11] Den that man Daniel was put in that L's
[52:14] den and the Bible says in that L's Den
[52:17] he praised God my God in the lies then
[52:21] he was still praising God you say how
[52:24] could a man who was sweat surround amen
[52:27] by hungry lines praise God because the
[52:30] lines then did not change the line of
[52:33] the tribe that he came out of see before
[52:36] he went in there he come from the line
[52:38] of Praise while he was in there he was
[52:40] still in the line of Praise And when he
[52:43] come out of there he was still a part of
[52:45] the tribe of Judah which was the tribe
[52:48] of Praise my God I feel like preaching
[52:50] and here tonight is a group of people
[52:53] who has been through trouble and trouble
[52:55] couldn't stop you amen you've been
[52:57] through the fire and the fire couldn't
[52:59] destroy you youve been through the flood
[53:01] but the flood couldn't round you because
[53:03] there was a praise on the inside of your
[53:06] heart and that praise had to come forth
[53:08] brother cancer can't kill that praise
[53:11] depression can't kill that praise family
[53:13] trouble can't kill that praise that's an
[53:15] eternal praise amen that came from an
[53:17] eternal God and it's got to declare
[53:20] itself M to think tonight that there
[53:22] ain't enough things we've been through
[53:24] that's going to destroy amen the
[53:27] that's on the inside of our
[53:29] hearts this is not according to the
[53:32] Covenant that I made with her fathers in
[53:34] the day when I took them by the hand
[53:36] Amen to lead them out of the land of
[53:37] Egypt this is not that Covenant he said
[53:40] because they continue not in my Covenant
[53:43] and I regarded them not sayith the Lord
[53:45] for this is the Covenant that I will
[53:48] make with the house of Israel after
[53:50] those days sayith the Lord I will put my
[53:52] laws into their mind and will write them
[53:56] into their hearts see this is moving
[53:59] beyond your head it's moving beyond the
[54:02] Realms of your intellectual capabilities
[54:05] it's moving into the depths of your
[54:07] hearts where Peter would say Amen that
[54:10] we have come or rather Paul would say we
[54:12] have come to Mount Zion now think of
[54:15] this tonight church that we have come
[54:17] Amen to a place where God is still God
[54:21] and nothing can change our God he said
[54:24] and notice I will put it in the Hearts I
[54:27] will write it in their hearts and I will
[54:29] be to them a God and they shall be to me
[54:32] a people isn't that beautiful to know
[54:35] that it's not just a God who is an
[54:37] Overlord but he's actually con he's
[54:40] actually connected himself to you amen
[54:43] not through a feeling amen not through a
[54:45] sensation but he has connected himself
[54:48] to you by divine revelation see and they
[54:51] shall teach not every man is neighbor
[54:53] and every man is brother saying know the
[54:55] Lord for All Shall know me from the
[54:58] least to the greatest isn't this
[55:00] beautiful amen that in this day he is
[55:03] not starting a new creation amen based
[55:06] upon the natural seed line but he is
[55:08] starting a new creation based upon the
[55:10] spiritual creation amen it was not to
[55:13] start with a man It Started With Jesus
[55:15] Christ and to think tonight that what
[55:17] he's speaking of Amen is there's going
[55:19] to come a people who is not going to die
[55:22] immature anden they're not going to sit
[55:24] in the nest and rot away
[55:26] but there's going to be a quickening
[55:28] power that's going to come for from the
[55:30] presence of God and it's not going to
[55:32] bring them amen back to being a bunch of
[55:34] babies but it's going to bring them into
[55:37] being mature Sons and Daughters of God
[55:39] oh we don't know what we shall be but we
[55:41] know when we shall see him amen we shall
[55:44] have a body amen lock into his own
[55:46] glorious body brother I'll tell you what
[55:49] it's time to do it's time to kick every
[55:51] devil out of your way and realize that
[55:54] there is a promised seed only in inside
[55:56] of your soul and nothing hey nothing is
[56:00] going to stop that seed amen from coming
[56:03] into full
[56:05] maturity he said for I will be merciful
[56:08] to the unrighteous and their sins and
[56:11] their iniquities will I remember no more
[56:14] isn't that beautiful he's telling them
[56:16] I'm going to start a new covenant with
[56:17] you it's not going to be after the order
[56:19] of the old it's going to be after the
[56:21] order not of the natural priesthood it's
[56:24] going to be after the order
[56:26] of
[56:28] MDC see it's going to come after the
[56:31] order of MDC brother if you can keep
[56:34] that air conditioner off of me I'd
[56:35] appreciate it thank you it'll take my
[56:37] voice out the door with it you love the
[56:39] Lord tonight for I will be merciful to
[56:42] their unrighteous notices and their sins
[56:44] how many can say thank God that your
[56:47] sins are no longer remembered see a
[56:50] prophet did not come and announce you as
[56:52] just a forgiving bride he did not
[56:54] announce you just as somebody but he
[56:56] traced you all the way back to the
[56:58] beginning and said Justified it's not as
[57:01] forgiven it's as though you never even
[57:04] done it my God it's as though you've
[57:08] never even done it in the first place
[57:10] and in that he saith a New Covenant he
[57:12] has made the first old now that which
[57:15] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[57:17] vanish away see so tonight amen you are
[57:20] not a part of something that's got the
[57:22] ability Decay you are not a part of
[57:25] something tonight that's got the ability
[57:27] to pass away you are a part of the word
[57:30] and the word says Heaven and Earth shall
[57:33] pass away amen but my word shall never
[57:36] pass away and to think tonight church
[57:38] that there's an eternal seed on the
[57:40] inside of your soul when this Earth has
[57:42] passed away you'll still be standing
[57:45] when this world is atomic Potter you'll
[57:47] still be standing amen because we have
[57:50] not come Amen to mount defeat but we
[57:53] have come to mount Victory we have not
[57:55] come under a partial gospel we have been
[57:58] called Amen to stand under a Full Gospel
[58:02] friends we've not just been called to be
[58:04] associated with the Full Gospel we have
[58:07] been called Amen to preach the full word
[58:10] with full power amen with full assurance
[58:12] that the god that wrote the Bible is
[58:14] still here among us tonight and he's
[58:16] just as able tonight amen to fulfill the
[58:20] promise that he already made you my God
[58:23] have mercy Hallelujah we we have come to
[58:26] the Full Gospel can you say Amen we we
[58:29] are determined Amen to preach the Full
[58:31] Gospel and to stay with it for it is the
[58:34] light of the day now watch the full
[58:36] gospel is the Holy Ghost Gospel can you
[58:39] agree and that Full Gospel is the Holy
[58:42] Ghost Gospel and a prophet would say
[58:44] that Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with
[58:48] blood what is the gospel well the gospel
[58:52] means the good news can you say Amen see
[58:54] what the gospel is is the gospel is the
[58:57] living reality of Jesus Christ see it's
[59:00] not just a letter amen it's not just a
[59:03] historical standpoint but the gospel is
[59:06] the living reality my to think that a
[59:09] prophet would pick up a sermon and would
[59:11] call it living dying buried rising and
[59:14] coming I'll tell you what it's beautiful
[59:17] there I I don't have time to get into it
[59:18] but it's a beautiful study when a
[59:20] prophet takes that and says watch it's
[59:22] the gospel unfolding see the gospel is
[59:26] unfolding for the purpose of the one
[59:28] that's coming to what was the living
[59:30] living he loved me amen what was the
[59:33] dying dying he saved me what was the
[59:36] Buried buried he carried my sins far
[59:39] away what was the rising the rising was
[59:42] the
[59:43] justification and what was the coming oh
[59:46] some glorious day he's not coming for a
[59:49] sinful bride he's coming for a sinless
[59:52] bride amen and she's not going to have a
[59:54] spot and she's not going to have have
[59:56] Rinko my to think tonight church that
[59:59] the Full Gospel is not just for your
[1:00:01] soul but it's also for your body see the
[1:00:04] gospel did not come just to change your
[1:00:06] soul amen but the power that changed
[1:00:09] your soul is going to change your
[1:00:12] body my God I feel like preaching the
[1:00:15] power that changed your soul is going to
[1:00:18] change your body you say what are you
[1:00:19] talking about you say brother and I got
[1:00:21] an eternal Soul you're exactly right
[1:00:23] you've got an eternal Soul that's been
[1:00:25] changed by the power of an eternal God
[1:00:28] but right here tonight we're living in a
[1:00:30] crooked and a perverse nation and we're
[1:00:32] battling this flesh but we got a promise
[1:00:35] that there is a power in this gospel
[1:00:38] that cannot just change our soul amen
[1:00:40] but it'll change our bodies in the
[1:00:42] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:45] Hallelujah see said what is Divine
[1:00:47] Healing he said Divine Healing is for
[1:00:49] the body what is forgiveness is for
[1:00:51] forgiveness of sin and for the cleansing
[1:00:54] of the Soul now in First Corinthians
[1:00:56] 15:3 Paul says for I delivered unto you
[1:00:58] first of all that which I also received
[1:01:01] how that Christ died amen for our sins
[1:01:04] now watch what Paul puts in here it's
[1:01:06] beautiful according to the scriptures
[1:01:09] see Christ did not die according to
[1:01:12] anything else but the scriptures and
[1:01:15] that he was buried and that he rose
[1:01:17] again the third day according to the
[1:01:20] scriptures let's let's say that together
[1:01:22] according to the scriptures See's going
[1:01:25] to pick it up and say now he could do
[1:01:27] something apart from his word but he
[1:01:29] sticks with his word my and to think
[1:01:33] tonight church that someone told brother
[1:01:35] Brandon brother brandham you preached
[1:01:36] too much on the resurrection he said
[1:01:38] every message you preach has something
[1:01:41] to do with the resurrection he said the
[1:01:43] resurrection is a powerful promise
[1:01:46] aren't you thankful tonight for the
[1:01:48] promise of a resurrection in in a
[1:01:51] message Mother's Day watch sure it's the
[1:01:53] Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no
[1:01:55] matter what he did if he did not rise
[1:01:58] again from the dead then all of it was
[1:02:00] in vain it to me proves that he was God
[1:02:04] it proves every claim he made the
[1:02:06] resurrection and it is also the place of
[1:02:08] the resting of the Soul see where your
[1:02:10] soul is resting tonight it's not resting
[1:02:13] upon the works of a man it's not resting
[1:02:16] upon the ability of a church but your
[1:02:18] soul is resting upon the promise of a
[1:02:21] resurrection see it's the it's the
[1:02:23] starting point it's the crowning of our
[1:02:25] consolation and when we see that he rose
[1:02:28] from the dead it places us with the
[1:02:30] gospel armor woo brother when we see
[1:02:34] that he rose from the dead amen it
[1:02:36] places us with the gospel armor armor
[1:02:39] and it doesn't put us at the backfront
[1:02:41] it puts us at the
[1:02:43] Battlefront he said to take the place
[1:02:46] and to fight for we know he said he that
[1:02:48] will lose his life for my sake shall
[1:02:50] find it again and I think it's the great
[1:02:52] coronation of the Full Gospel is the
[1:02:55] resurrection Direction and its Divine
[1:02:57] promises and the consolation that it
[1:02:59] gives those who are trusted in it for it
[1:03:01] promises that the great Union of our
[1:03:03] uniting together again now watch it's
[1:03:05] promises and the fading away of sin it's
[1:03:09] promises and notice this the fading away
[1:03:12] of all deformities and the Fai in the
[1:03:14] way of all sicknesses and sufferings
[1:03:16] what we have did in this how to go
[1:03:18] through this life is promises see and
[1:03:21] Vanishing of it all it's promises that
[1:03:23] even death will lose its whole
[1:03:26] see and will rise in the likeness of
[1:03:28] Jesus so to my opinion the resurrection
[1:03:31] is the greatest of all the promises in
[1:03:34] the things of the scripture see brother
[1:03:36] manah did not leave the scripture he
[1:03:38] pointed the church back to the scripture
[1:03:40] because everything that's going to be
[1:03:42] done is going to be done according to
[1:03:46] the scripture my Amen to think tonight
[1:03:48] that the message of the hour has not
[1:03:50] come amen according to the idea of
[1:03:52] William
[1:03:53] brandom this message has come
[1:03:56] according to the scripture for Jesus
[1:03:59] said search the scriptures in them you
[1:04:02] think you have eternal life and they
[1:04:04] testify of me see he was not out of the
[1:04:07] scripture he was in the scripture oh my
[1:04:10] feel like preaching right here Jesus was
[1:04:13] not coming away from the scripture he
[1:04:15] was in the scripture in the beginning
[1:04:17] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:04:20] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:04:22] made flesh see Jesus was in the Bible
[1:04:25] and in symbolic form but what brought
[1:04:28] him to reality was quickening power amen
[1:04:31] brought it from word form into reality
[1:04:33] form and if that same spirit amen that
[1:04:36] raised up Jesus from the dead shall
[1:04:38] dwell in you then it shall Quicken your
[1:04:41] mortal body brother sister I tell you
[1:04:43] what amen you didn't get put in this
[1:04:45] word by a prophet you was already in
[1:04:47] this
[1:04:50] word oh do you see when the body of
[1:04:53] Jesus Amen was laying in the grave what
[1:04:55] was laying there it was a body it was a
[1:04:57] powerless lifeless body but quickening
[1:05:00] Power amen didn't go in there and put
[1:05:03] the word in the grave quicken in power
[1:05:05] amen brought the word body out of the
[1:05:07] Grave church and here we are we was
[1:05:10] buried under our sin we was buried under
[1:05:13] trespasses we was buried under
[1:05:15] iniquities we was buried under the sins
[1:05:17] of our family but the quicking power
[1:05:19] amen walked into the graveyard and said
[1:05:22] Lazarus come forth and we might have
[1:05:24] been dead for 4 years or for 40 years
[1:05:27] but there was a seed on the inside of
[1:05:29] our soul and that seed amen had to give
[1:05:32] way to the pulsation of God brother I
[1:05:35] feel that same quickening power anden
[1:05:37] roaring through this building right now
[1:05:39] what is it church it's a reality amen

[1:06:58] scripture see the devil is not afraid of
[1:07:01] a scripture laying in word
[1:07:04] form that don't scare the devil but what
[1:07:07] scares the devil is when the spirit of
[1:07:09] inspiration amen moves upon that

[1:10:44] hallelujah my to think tonight which is
[1:10:48] not another but this is the same gospel
[1:10:52] that Paul preached has returned in this
[1:10:54] generation
[1:10:56] not just to be preached but to be
[1:10:58] fulfilled sir see and Paul was even so
[1:11:02] sure of this gospel he was so sure of
[1:11:05] this blessed book that he said if an
[1:11:07] angel come from heaven and preach one
[1:11:10] thing different than what I've already
[1:11:12] preached you let that angel be a curse
[1:11:15] see because brother Bram said I cannot
[1:11:17] be a Catholic now watch he said I cannot
[1:11:20] be a Catholic because they believe the
[1:11:22] word is inspired but they believe that
[1:11:24] the church is over the word he said I
[1:11:27] can't go that way he said I can't be a
[1:11:29] Protestant because they only take as
[1:11:32] much of the word as they want and what
[1:11:34] they don't want they leave he said so I
[1:11:36] can't be you ever notice that he said
[1:11:39] the Protestants only take what they
[1:11:41] think is inspired yeah yeah why did that
[1:11:44] Prophet tell the story of the man that
[1:11:46] came back to his mama who was dying with
[1:11:49] cancer said Mom I thought you was dying
[1:11:51] she said well son I was she said but
[1:11:54] then some of them Full Gospel hallelujah

[1:11:58] and took the Bible and they read Mark 16
[1:12:01] over me and said they shall lay hands on
[1:12:03] the sick and they shall recover she said
[1:12:05] brother and they anointed we with whole
[1:12:07] and she said son I don't know I was eat
[1:12:09] up with cancer but they laid their hand
[1:12:12] on me and she said I'm completely whole
[1:12:14] and her son stopped and he said what
[1:12:16] book did you read mom she said they read
[1:12:19] the Bible he said what did they read she

[1:12:35] 16:9 you know what verse 9 says and he
[1:12:40] appeared and he appeared unto them see
[1:12:44] so even back then they was already
[1:12:47] rejecting his appearing come on even
[1:12:51] back then they was already rejecting his
[1:12:52] appearing and here we are some 2,000
[1:12:55] years later and a prophet is standing on
[1:12:57] a platform and he's calling things
[1:12:59] identically and accurately and they're
[1:13:02] they're they're rejecting that he has
[1:13:04] appeared oh but may I say tonight we are
[1:13:07] not a Matthew 21 Church who is sitting
[1:13:10] here saying who is this but we are
[1:13:12] screaming this is Jesus Christ this is
[1:13:14] the king of kings this is the appearing
[1:13:17] of the son of man this is the promised
[1:13:19] word for this day being fulfilled right
[1:13:22] before our very eyes my we are either
[1:13:24] going to accept it or we're going to
[1:13:26] reject it but is there anybody here

[1:13:30] it is there anybody here that's going to
[1:13:32] accept it I'm not talking about part of
[1:13:34] it I'm talking about line upon line and
[1:13:37] precept upon precept and here a little
[1:13:39] and there a little until we don't come
[1:13:41] Amen to a defeated church but we come to

[1:16:23] bunch of forms and a bunch of Fashions
[1:16:26] and a bunch of Creeds and a bunch of cow
[1:16:28] worship and he's tried to shut everybody

[1:17:38] one's salvation come on see that's the
[1:17:40] Warfare out there is right here tonight

[1:18:02] you that God said healing is true but
[1:18:04] it's not for
[1:18:06] you but here's my thing if there's a
[1:18:08] group of people who can cross the line
[1:18:11] amen between mercy and judgment and
[1:18:13] cross into judgment never to return to
[1:18:16] Mercy again then I
[1:18:19] believe I believe that there's a people

[1:19:24] that any of evil fault is pierced the
[1:19:26] Soul by the fiery darts of the devil
[1:19:28] that you would drive away this evil
[1:19:29] enemy of thine and of thy people and we
[1:19:31] would ask that you would send the Holy
[1:19:33] Spirit to take a hold of the word at
[1:19:35] this time as we yield ourselves as

[1:20:13] revealing what is already in there oh
[1:20:17] Church don't you see why Prophet would

[1:20:26] was showing that this message was not
[1:20:29] putting the music in you this message
[1:20:31] was only revealing what was already
[1:20:34] laying there from a former civilization

[1:20:55] readjusted to the cause of
[1:20:58] Christ now I'm coming to a close here
[1:21:00] but I want to ask you something just a
[1:21:02] second you know what a chiropractor
[1:21:05] is yeah let me see your hands you know
[1:21:07] what a chiropractor is so you know what
[1:21:09] you do you go to a chiropractor to get
[1:21:11] adjusted yeah you know why because
[1:21:14] something has slipped out of place right
[1:21:16] something has come out of line and you
[1:21:19] got to go get
[1:21:22] readjusted amen so you can walk walk
[1:21:24] right so you can feel right I remember
[1:21:27] the first time I went to a chiropractor
[1:21:29] man that was an experience I tell you
[1:21:31] what I went in there and he said lay
[1:21:33] down I thought oh Lord so I laid down
[1:21:36] and he took this arm and crack and that
[1:21:38] arm and crack and before long everything
[1:21:40] was
[1:21:41] cracking oh my Lord I got to pay for
[1:21:43] this too I mean everything then he said
[1:21:45] now be real calm you know they grab your
[1:21:47] head and say be real calm and how can
[1:21:49] you be calm and
[1:21:51] still be real calm and relax and think
[1:21:53] good
[1:21:56] so I'm laying there and the guy says you
[1:21:58] know what sir normally it takes me a
[1:22:00] long time on people now no offense here
[1:22:03] he said because most of the people I see
[1:22:04] is older people he said now their bones
[1:22:07] are a lot stiffer and their muscles are
[1:22:10] a lot tighter and it takes some time to
[1:22:12] loosen up it takes some he said now
[1:22:14] somebody young can just come in and lay
[1:22:16] down and crack and they're gone but see
[1:22:18] that body's been through something yeah
[1:22:21] now now can you fellowship with me here
[1:22:22] for a second remember when you first got
[1:22:24] saved and you come to church and it was
[1:22:27] so easy to raise your hand man you come
[1:22:30] to the door raising your
[1:22:31] hand remember when somebody asked you
[1:22:34] how you was doing and all you could say
[1:22:35] was too blessed to be stressed and too
[1:22:38] anointed to be disappointed and too
[1:22:40] elected to be defeat remember those days
[1:22:42] amen you know what you was young amen
[1:22:44] but then that body started going through
[1:22:46] some stuff and you know what before long
[1:22:48] you come in church and because the
[1:22:50] trials and the tribulations and the
[1:22:51] pressures and the strains and the
[1:22:53] circumstances it wasn't so easy to lift
[1:22:55] that hand no more amen clapping wasn't
[1:22:58] that easy no more come on church amen
[1:23:00] before long when somebody asked you how
[1:23:01] you was doing you didn't have time to
[1:23:03] tell him how bad things was going you
[1:23:05] know why because that body started going
[1:23:07] through something and then that preacher
[1:23:09] would get up and man you remember when
[1:23:10] you first got saved man brother Ben
[1:23:12] would get behind the pull pit and
[1:23:14] everything he said my it was like the
[1:23:16] fresh Angel bread dropped down from the
[1:23:17] corridors of Heaven come off of the
[1:23:19] Heavenly stove itself and drop right
[1:23:21] down in your soul and it was like honey
[1:23:23] and then you get through a few trials
[1:23:25] and through few tests and a few
[1:23:27] situations and before long the preachers
[1:23:29] got to preach for 10 minutes before you
[1:23:30] could even say
[1:23:33] Amen a you know what because he's got to
[1:23:35] lay you down sometimes and he's got to
[1:23:37] take this word and he's got to line you
[1:23:40] back up to this word you say brother
[1:23:41] Andrew that's a sign I'm not saved no
[1:23:44] that's a sign that there's a new spirit
[1:23:46] amen that's come on the inside of your
[1:23:48] heart when that old man was there that
[1:23:50] old man thought with every word that was
[1:23:52] preached that old man said well it's too
[1:23:54] hot and that old man said well I don't
[1:23:56] like the music and the old man said well
[1:23:58] he didn't sing my favorite song Amen but
[1:24:00] once the old man died and the new man
[1:24:03] come on he did not come forth holding a
[1:24:05] critical spirit he did not come forth
[1:24:08] holding a judgmental Spirit but he came
[1:24:10] forth holding forth the word of life my
[1:24:13] to than tonight church that we are not a
[1:24:15] bunch of church members but we are
[1:24:17] delegates of the Messiah Kingdom which
[1:24:20] means we are holding forth amen the word
[1:24:22] of this Kingdom and my Bible says that
[1:24:25] we come from the same line This Bible
[1:24:27] says they were stoned they were sown
[1:24:30] aunder they were tempted they were slain
[1:24:32] with a sword they wondered about in
[1:24:34] sheep skin they wondered about in goat
[1:24:36] skin being destitute and Afflicted and
[1:24:38] tormented of whom the world was not even
[1:24:41] worthy amen they wandered in deserts and
[1:24:44] mountains and in dens and caves said
[1:24:47] what did they do they walk through the
[1:24:48] darkest places holding forth the
[1:24:51] brightest
[1:24:52] light Hallelujah can have minutes here
[1:24:54] and I'll quit soon they walk through the
[1:24:56] darkest places holding forth the
[1:24:59] brightest light church I want to tell
[1:25:01] you tonight no matter how hard it gets
[1:25:04] you just remember that the sun is still
[1:25:07] shining on the other side of those
[1:25:11] clouds brother and you know what it's
[1:25:14] just a it's just a quick trip through
[1:25:16] the clouds and you'll be back in the
[1:25:18] presence of the sun oh to think tonight
[1:25:21] that we have been called to live not by
[1:25:23] one word but by by every word to think
[1:25:25] tonight that we are a word bride living
[1:25:28] a life by the word and we are expressing
[1:25:30] amen the very thoughts of God therefore
[1:25:33] the word of life is not laying in a
[1:25:35] dormant Soul it's laying in a quickening
[1:25:38] spirit amen I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:25:41] land here
[1:25:44] okay amen I got out I got out of the
[1:25:48] airport the other day over there in
[1:25:49] Auckland man I told brother Ben there is
[1:25:51] this big old Singapore Airline sitting
[1:25:53] out there man double
[1:25:54] had about six had about six wheels on
[1:25:57] each side man that thing moved real slow
[1:25:59] you know I thought my Lord I bet they
[1:26:01] got about three or 400 people on there
[1:26:03] and about 50 or 60 hundred or not that
[1:26:06] much about 50 or 60 some bags underneath
[1:26:08] each part of that plane and then you got
[1:26:10] all the other stuff in there I thought
[1:26:11] how in the world are they going to get
[1:26:13] it off the ground you know what the
[1:26:15] problem ain't so much getting it off the
[1:26:17] problem is getting it down and that's
[1:26:19] the same way it is when inspiration
[1:26:21] comes it may take a while to get off but
[1:26:23] when the of God start soaring friends
[1:26:25] aren't you thankful tonight that you
[1:26:27] ain't just soaring in justification you
[1:26:29] ain't just soaring in sanctification you
[1:26:32] ain't even soaring under a Pentecostal
[1:26:34] anointing but you are soaring amen under
[1:26:37] an eagle anointing and that eagle
[1:26:39] anointing is an adoption anointing it's
[1:26:41] a placing anointing it's a choosing
[1:26:43] anointing that is that is told you you
[1:26:46] was not born Amen to be chickened you
[1:26:49] was born to be transformal lied
[1:26:54] ah the spirit of God is truth and where
[1:26:56] the spirit of God is there is Liberty
[1:26:59] then therefore what does Paul mean when
[1:27:00] he says we are holding forth the word of
[1:27:03] life he is telling us to give our
[1:27:04] attention to this word he's telling us
[1:27:07] to apply ourselves to this word he is
[1:27:09] telling us to find our place in the word
[1:27:12] and there fulfill the place that was
[1:27:15] written of us
[1:27:16] amen you see here now if he could do
[1:27:20] that sir says if he could do that now
[1:27:23] how many believes that if you give your
[1:27:24] attention this message you're going to
[1:27:26] get a
[1:27:28] blessing he said now if he could do that
[1:27:30] sir you know it had to come from a
[1:27:33] supernatural resource he's talking to a
[1:27:34] man he just called out so with the
[1:27:36] audience see but it'll be up to them but
[1:27:39] what what if you think it's of the
[1:27:41] devil right then you get a devil's
[1:27:45] reward right but if you think it's
[1:27:49] God
[1:27:51] Amen catching a second wind if you think
[1:27:54] it's God then you get a god reward is't
[1:27:58] that beautiful you say what are you
[1:27:59] talking about Peter and John told a
[1:28:01] crippled man look on us but said those
[1:28:04] three words were three words to catch
[1:28:06] that man's attention and they said
[1:28:08] Silver and Gold Have we none but such as
[1:28:11] we have give we unto thee in the name of
[1:28:14] Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the
[1:28:16] Bible says immediately the spirit went
[1:28:19] through his body and a man that had been
[1:28:21] laying in church I mean had been laying
[1:28:24] all right had been laying by the gate
[1:28:27] for some hundreds or for some years how
[1:28:30] many years was that promise laying in
[1:28:32] the scripture that the sick shall be
[1:28:34] healed and the lame shall leap and the
[1:28:36] crippled shall walk and the Death Shall
[1:28:38] hear but in just a few minutes time in
[1:28:41] the presence of the God who wrote The
[1:28:43] Promise fulfilling the promise a man who
[1:28:46] had been sitting there crippled rose up
[1:28:48] on his feet and begin to
[1:28:51] walk brother how many can agree with me
[1:28:54] for a few minutes that you remember
[1:28:56] being there you was sitting in that
[1:28:57] church pew and you was crippled you was
[1:29:00] crippled with your past amen you was
[1:29:03] crippled with your mistakes you was
[1:29:05] crippled with all the troubles in your
[1:29:06] family you couldn't walk on the Promises
[1:29:08] of God for being crippled but then you
[1:29:11] heard a prophet say good evening
[1:29:14] friends you heard a man of God raise up
[1:29:17] and say Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:29:20] such as I have give I Thee and you look
[1:29:23] away to Jesus and that man of God by the
[1:29:26] preaching of the word of life amen got
[1:29:28] your eyes off of your problem and got
