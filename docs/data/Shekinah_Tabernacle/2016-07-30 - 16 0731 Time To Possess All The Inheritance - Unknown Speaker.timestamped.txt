[40:08] Luke chapter
[40:18] 12 we got a uh verse 29
[40:36] So just a reminder that the prayer
[40:37] meeting once again is at Puk Bay this
[40:39] Wednesday So I like thank you all for
[40:42] coming out on Wednesday night Who was
[40:43] blessed Wednesday night Amen It was
[40:45] tremendous wasn't it So
[40:48] amen Praise the Lord So Luke Luke 12 and
[40:51] verse 29 we'll read down to verse 42
[41:01] He says
[41:02] "Now and seek
[41:04] not ye what ye shall eat or what you
[41:07] shall drink neither be of doubtful mind
[41:10] For all these things do the nations of
[41:12] the world seek after and your father
[41:14] knoweth that ye have need of these
[41:16] things But rather seek ye the kingdom of
[41:19] God and all these things shall be added
[41:21] unto you Fear not little flock for it's
[41:23] your father's good pleasure to give you
[41:25] the kingdom." Amen Sell that ye have and
[41:27] give arms Provide yourselves bags which
[41:29] wax not old a treasure in heavens that
[41:32] faileth not Where no thief approacheth
[41:35] neither moth corruptth For where your
[41:37] treasure is there will your heart be
[41:40] also Let your loins be girded about and
[41:43] your lights burning And ye yourselves
[41:46] like unto men that wait for their Lord
[41:48] when he will return from the wedding
[41:50] that when he cometh and knockth they may
[41:53] open unto him immediately Blessed are
[41:56] those servants whom the Lord when he
[41:58] cometh shall find watching Verily I say
[42:00] unto you that he shall g himself and
[42:05] shall make them sit down to meet and
[42:07] shall come forth and serve them And if
[42:09] he shall come in the second watch or in
[42:11] the third watch and find them so blessed
[42:14] are those servants And this know that if
[42:17] the good man of the house had known what
[42:19] hour the thief would come he would have
[42:22] watched and not have suffered his house
[42:23] to be broken through
[42:25] But ye therefore ready also for the Son
[42:27] of man cometh at an hour when ye think
[42:30] not Amen And the Lord said no sorry
[42:33] verse 41 And then Peter said unto him
[42:36] Lord speak thou this parable unto us or
[42:39] even to all And the Lord said Who then
[42:42] is that faithful and wise steward whom
[42:45] his Lord shall make ruler over his
[42:47] household to give them their portion of
[42:50] meat in due season Blessed is that
[42:52] servant whom is lord when he cometh
[42:54] shall find him so doing Of a truth I say
[42:57] unto you that he shall make him ruler
[42:59] over all that he hath But and if that
[43:02] servant may say in his heart "My lord
[43:05] delayeth his coming," and shall begin to
[43:07] beat the man's men's servants and
[43:09] maidens and to eat and drink and to be
[43:11] drunken the the lord of that servant
[43:13] will cometh in a day when he lookth not
[43:15] for him and at an hour when he is not
[43:18] aware and will cut him aunder and shall
[43:21] appoint his portion with the
[43:25] unbelievers And now let's go to Joshua
[43:27] chapter 1
[43:39] I'm going to read down verse verse one
[43:41] to verse
[43:43] 9 I know it's very
[43:47] familiar piece of scripture to to all of
[43:50] us
[43:53] but just going to read
[43:55] this now After the death of Moses the
[43:58] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[44:00] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[44:01] Nun Moses minister saying Moses my
[44:04] servant is dead Now therefore arise go
[44:06] over this Jordan thou and all this
[44:09] people unto the land which I do give to
[44:11] them even to the children of Israel
[44:13] every place that the soul of your foot
[44:15] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[44:17] you as I have unto Moses From the
[44:20] wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[44:23] the great river the river Euphrates all
[44:25] the land of the Hittites and unto the
[44:27] great sea towards the going down of the
[44:29] sun shall be your coast There shall not
[44:32] any man be able to stand before thee all
[44:34] the days of thy life As I was with Moses
[44:36] so shall I be with thee I'll not fail
[44:39] thee nor forsake thee Be strong and of
[44:42] good courage for unto this people shalt
[44:45] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[44:48] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[44:50] them Only be thou strong and very
[44:53] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[44:56] do according to all the law which Moses
[44:58] my servant commanded thee Turn not from
[45:01] it to the right hand or to the left that
[45:03] thou mayest prosper wheresoever thou
[45:05] goest This book of the law shall not
[45:07] depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt
[45:09] meditate there in day and night that
[45:11] thou mayest observe to do according to
[45:13] all that is written therein For then
[45:16] thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[45:18] then thou shalt have good success Have I
[45:21] not commanded thee Be strong and be of
[45:24] good courage Be not afraid neither be
[45:26] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[45:28] with thee wherever thou goest Amen May
[45:32] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[45:34] You may have your
[45:38] seats I want
[45:40] to I want to try and approach a bit of a
[45:44] subject You know
[45:48] we we have very uh we have many
[45:50] distractions in this
[45:52] world But we understand that you know
[45:55] with this parable where Jesus would
[45:57] speak of parables and we heard on
[45:59] Wednesday night that there's uh you know
[46:00] the parables they they are parables or
[46:03] just stories to some but it's been
[46:05] revealed to others what they mean And as
[46:08] Jesus would would speak in Matthew I
[46:10] believe it is chapter 13 he he would he
[46:13] he spoke the parables to the multitudes
[46:15] and then the then the disciples came to
[46:18] him and they begin to ask him what these
[46:20] things mean And he and he would begin to
[46:22] tell them how how um he answered the the
[46:26] disciples came and they said why do you
[46:28] speak thou unto them in parables Why do
[46:30] you speak to them just like well these
[46:31] are just stories and a s went to sew and
[46:34] the kingdom of God is like a fisherman
[46:35] who casts out a net and he uses all
[46:37] these examples and he said it's he and
[46:39] he answered and he says because it's
[46:41] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[46:42] the kingdom but to them it's not given
[46:45] but whosoever hath to him shall be
[46:48] given and he uh shall have more
[46:51] abundance but whosoever hath not from
[46:53] him it shall be taken away even that he
[46:56] hath And so he began to speak this way
[47:00] because he wanted to really see
[47:04] uh what the people caught You know it's
[47:06] not a it's not like we have to clutch at
[47:08] straws and try and work out things but
[47:11] God in his great love and mercy he
[47:13] causes us to understand his word I mean
[47:16] he causes us to understand the day and
[47:18] hour that we're alive in You know he
[47:20] causes us to understand who we are in
[47:23] him You know we don't when when it's
[47:25] anchored down in your soul that God is
[47:28] not a God of history that he didn't just
[47:31] die on the cross and raised and now he's
[47:33] gone someplace for 2,000 years and we're
[47:35] just going on But God in every age in
[47:39] every generation God has been dealing
[47:41] And he's not a distant God someplace but
[47:44] as Paul would say he's not far from any
[47:46] one of us Amen But he is dealing in in
[47:49] in the lives of men and women and
[47:52] children because he's interested in in
[47:54] where we want to go Amen And he's
[47:56] interested in in having a real
[47:58] relationship with us You know he doesn't
[48:00] just want to give us you know we don't
[48:03] walk by blind faith I'll put it that way
[48:06] We're not just blindly following some
[48:08] distant God But God speaks to us and he
[48:12] shows us in his word the way we should
[48:14] go And he's there to guide us every step
[48:17] of the way if we look for him Amen If
[48:20] we're not looking for him we cannot be
[48:22] guided And so God you know our God is a
[48:25] present help in time of trouble And we
[48:28] understand that we live in a time of
[48:30] trouble But you know he's not you know
[48:32] Christianity this message is not just
[48:34] well we have a form of religion and here
[48:36] we are on a Sunday and you know we come
[48:38] and we want to hear something new and
[48:40] now I you know it's more than that But
[48:43] our God is a personal God Amen You
[48:46] brother Brandon he would always say "He
[48:47] is here." And God would come down and
[48:50] supernaturally prove that that that the
[48:53] that the God that the prophet was
[48:54] speaking about came upon the same
[48:56] platform and he revealed himself to show
[48:59] that God is interested in every little
[49:01] detail It's just like when Saul was you
[49:05] know Saul before Samuel anointed him but
[49:07] you know s Saul was sent to go find some
[49:09] lost I think donkeys or something And it
[49:13] was all recorded in the Bible And then
[49:14] when he when he came to Samuel because
[49:16] he couldn't find them So he says "We'll
[49:18] go to Samuel and we'll and we'll give
[49:20] him an offering and hopefully the Lord
[49:22] will reveal to him where our where our
[49:24] donkeys are." And then so but that was
[49:26] all orchestrated because Samuel was to
[49:28] anoint Saul king And it was and then so
[49:32] Samuel said to Saul "Don't worry about"
[49:35] without him even asking him he says
[49:36] "Don't worry about your donkeys They've
[49:38] been found." say well it's such a
[49:40] insignificant thing but it's just to
[49:42] show that God is interested in even
[49:46] common day every everyday things Amen
[49:49] And that's why when you when you go
[49:51] forward to show that the same God that
[49:53] was back there is present in this
[49:55] generation is that when brother Bram was
[49:58] up in the northern British Columbia and
[50:00] some of the Indian people they you know
[50:02] a guy lost his horses and then brother
[50:04] says you'll find them in a certain place
[50:07] and he went and found them in a certain
[50:08] place Amen Amen You say it's such a
[50:10] common everyday thing but it's recorded
[50:13] in the word because God is interested in
[50:16] simple everyday things Amen because he's
[50:19] not a distant god someplace but he's
[50:22] present Amen
[50:24] Amen So he as I said in the very
[50:27] beginning well in prayer this is not a
[50:30] we know this is not a textbook It's not
[50:32] a newspaper where you just you know man
[50:35] has tried to learn the Bible You cannot
[50:37] learn the Bible It takes God to reveal
[50:40] it to us Amen But you know and Jesus
[50:44] would even say that these things are
[50:45] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[50:47] prudent but revealed to babes Amen So
[50:51] it's not our it's not our ability that
[50:54] that somehow gives us any merit to walk
[50:57] with God or our intelligence or our
[50:59] upbringing or our nationality or what
[51:02] languages we know That's irrelevant God
[51:05] you know it's not that that helps us
[51:07] walk with God It's God revealing himself
[51:10] to us and then we just give ourselves to
[51:13] him and we walk with him Amen That's the
[51:15] great secret Amen Because Paul brother
[51:18] Brandon he spoke of the Apostle Paul
[51:20] quite a lot And he would speak in a
[51:23] sermon called the absolute Now I'm still
[51:25] talking about I'm still there in Luke
[51:27] and Joshua I just want to lay a bit of a
[51:29] background Now he would he would preach
[51:32] a sermon called the absolute And he
[51:34] would go through the lives of many
[51:36] people in the scripture and say when
[51:38] they truly met God they had an absolute
[51:41] because it wasn't something you know
[51:44] someone who has an experience can never
[51:47] be can never be talked out of it Amen An
[51:51] argument is not the same as an
[51:52] experience And especially if your
[51:55] experience our experience must match
[51:57] God's word So if you can take your
[51:59] experience and take it into the
[52:01] scripture you know that that's God
[52:02] speaking to you because he's the author
[52:04] of the Bible And he would go into he
[52:07] would go into Paul's life and he would
[52:09] begin to say that Paul you know he was
[52:12] raised as we know at the feet of Galia
[52:14] who was one of the greatest Bible
[52:16] teachers of the day He knew the Bible
[52:18] back to front you know those you know in
[52:21] those days you know a a someone like
[52:24] Paul could quote the scripture from the
[52:26] start of what we call the Old Testament
[52:28] to the end He knew he knew the law
[52:31] perfectly in his mind but it wasn't it
[52:35] wasn't until he was on a road to
[52:38] Damascus and God and and in his heart he
[52:42] wanted to destroy these Christians
[52:44] because he felt that they were the
[52:45] enemies of of of his religion But he
[52:50] would begin to find out when when that
[52:52] same God he was persecuting the same God
[52:55] he read about as a pillar of fire that
[52:56] led Moses you know led the children of
[52:58] Israel you know from Egypt into the
[53:01] promised land that same God now met him
[53:03] on the road to Damascus And a bright
[53:05] shining light the scripture says shone
[53:07] down upon him And he looked up at this
[53:09] light and this you know cuz a voice
[53:11] spoke out of it and said "Saul Saul why
[53:14] do you persecute me?" Yeah And he looked
[53:17] at this light He said "And who are you
[53:19] Lord?" And that and that word he used
[53:21] was supreme one It wasn't just like a
[53:24] lord like an earthly lord Who are you
[53:26] you supreme being This this this this
[53:29] light this who are you He says "I'm
[53:31] Jesus whom you
[53:32] persecute." And he and he had this
[53:35] experience And then after that he goes
[53:37] to Damascus He was baptized you know and
[53:39] his eyes came back open And he said he
[53:42] went down into the into the desert and
[53:44] spent three years It says in the book of
[53:46] Galatians he spent three years to see
[53:49] the one he met to see that Jesus of the
[53:52] New Testament is Jehovah of the Old And
[53:55] the same God the same God that was back
[53:57] there that that he would read about in
[53:59] the and he would study about in the in
[54:02] the in the Bible schools was now a God
[54:04] of the present And he had met that same
[54:06] God And so this this gave him an
[54:10] absolute
[54:12] Amen You know what an absolute is you
[54:14] know it's like it's like the final say
[54:16] It's like an umpire in a game They have
[54:18] the final say in the game People can
[54:20] argue about it They can fuss about it
[54:22] They can write blogs about it They can
[54:24] have opinion pieces in the newspaper
[54:26] about it But at the end of the day that
[54:28] umpire's decision is the absolute in the
[54:31] game Amen And so now we must have an
[54:35] absolute That's right You understand Our
[54:37] absolute is is the revealed word of God
[54:40] You understand But but if you're just
[54:42] learned into it you can be argued out of
[54:44] it And many people unfortunately have
[54:47] because they haven't met the God of the
[54:49] message They haven't met the God of the
[54:51] Bible Amen And and the reason that the
[54:54] word has been revealed in this day is
[54:56] that we could meet him
[54:59] Amen And that he can come and dwell in
[55:01] us
[55:02] Now he says in the absolute in 62 now
[55:06] this is just coming into the story where
[55:08] where Paul is standing before king
[55:11] agrippa and he says and a grippa was a
[55:13] Jew as we
[55:16] know and when he was standing before
[55:18] these kings and things God had already
[55:20] told him he'd stand there so he had an
[55:23] absolute so he told exactly the heavenly
[55:26] vision so what happened on the road to
[55:28] Damascus he said I'm not I wasn't
[55:30] dishonorable to it I didn't misbehave
[55:34] myself but he held two and was not
[55:37] disobedient He carried it out to the
[55:39] minute for it was an
[55:41] absolute Amen Amen Maybe let's
[55:45] just now we won't read it but but so so
[55:47] he had that experience and it became his
[55:50] absolute You understand Amen And that
[55:53] held him through every trial through
[55:56] every storm through every question
[55:58] hardship wherever he went through he had
[56:00] an absolute that he could rest his soul
[56:04] upon For it was a so he carried out to
[56:07] the minute for it was an absolute Now
[56:09] Paul was a wise servant Amen He didn't
[56:13] remember when he was prophesying
[56:15] speaking of the rapture the catching
[56:17] away of the bride up into heaven When he
[56:19] was writing that to the Thessalonians he
[56:21] would have believed that would have been
[56:22] his group We which are alive and remain
[56:25] he said when he wrote it down He didn't
[56:26] say the future generations which alive
[56:28] and remain He said we which are alive
[56:31] and remain So he was under expectation
[56:33] I'm going to step from this world into
[56:35] the next world because of what Jesus has
[56:37] done for me So he was under expectation
[56:40] But even though it seemed that there was
[56:42] a delay in his coming he didn't lose he
[56:45] didn't lose track of what he was doing
[56:47] because he wasn't disobedient to the
[56:49] heavenly vision He had an absolute by
[56:52] meeting God on the road to Damascus He
[56:54] had an absolute and his whole life was
[56:56] was now structured around that absolute
[56:59] Amen
[57:01] But he held and was not disobedient He
[57:04] carried out to the minute for it was an
[57:05] absolute and any Christ centered life
[57:08] Now here we go We're going from Paul now
[57:10] into your lap and any Christ centered
[57:12] life that's your absolute now since
[57:16] meeting him face to face on the road to
[57:18] Damascus Um that meant so much to Paul
[57:22] Now remember he was a scholar beforehand
[57:25] He was a mighty man in the scriptures
[57:27] but he didn't have any
[57:29] typost but the Sanhedrin that would back
[57:32] him up and a diploma from a great
[57:33] teacher He was a great man in his field
[57:36] but he was waving Only thing he had his
[57:40] absolute would only be as strong as his
[57:43] organization
[57:44] was Yep So his absolute was based on
[57:47] what other people were
[57:48] doing That's all the stronger it could
[57:51] be He was working faithful to that and
[57:55] was taking Christians and binding them
[57:57] and making havoc of them and even st
[57:59] consented the stoning of Steven I think
[58:02] later in his life the reason he went to
[58:04] Jerusalem Amen he said that you know
[58:06] when the prophet told him don't go up
[58:08] there you know Paul for the chains and
[58:09] the prison await you but he knew he had
[58:11] to go to Rome
[58:14] now and this
[58:16] is this is in an absolute and shreports
[58:19] are a different service but I just want
[58:20] you to get he speaks about a Christ-c
[58:22] centered life yeah and every man or
[58:25] woman that's had an experience with God
[58:27] who's had an experience with God has met
[58:30] the same pillar of fire Amen Upon the
[58:33] sacred grounds of your heart There is no
[58:35] theologian no devil no nothing Paul said
[58:39] there's nothing present nothing future
[58:42] death sickness sorrow can separate us
[58:45] from that love of God that's in Christ
[58:47] Jesus It's a typost You know something
[58:51] happened No matter how much science
[58:53] raises up and says this or that or the
[58:55] other you're tied You and God become one
[58:58] He's in you and you in him At that day
[59:01] you'll know that I'm in the father the
[59:03] father in me I and you and you and me in
[59:06] that day when you meet him Amen You are
[59:09] tied to him Paul had a Christ centered
[59:12] life It was a different life than he
[59:15] once had Remember he was religious He
[59:18] believed in the one true living God Amen
[59:21] He had the he had the true word Yeah
[59:25] And he thought that his life was because
[59:28] Christ means the anointed or the
[59:30] anointing Yeah So he would have believed
[59:32] that his his his life was Christ
[59:35] centered But it
[59:37] wasn't then But it became Christ
[59:39] centered You see he got a because it
[59:43] made him different to what he what he
[59:44] once had He once had an educational
[59:48] conception but now he's got a Christ
[59:51] centered life an absolute No matter how
[59:54] much a gripple would say "You've gone
[59:56] crazy Paul You've lost your mind You've
[59:58] studied too much." He said "I
[1:00:02] am not mad." And when he got onto a
[1:00:06] gripper to such a way till he said "Thou
[1:00:08] almost persuaded me to be a Christian."
[1:00:10] He said "I wish you were only besides
[1:00:13] these and I am but these bonds." It
[1:00:16] makes you do things when you get a
[1:00:18] Christ centered life like Paul had
[1:00:22] ordinarily that you wouldn't do See here
[1:00:25] was a man who he was a man in chains But
[1:00:28] because he met he met the Lord on the
[1:00:31] road to Damascus he was the freest man
[1:00:33] in the building Amen Amen It was really
[1:00:36] the king of gripper and those that were
[1:00:38] examining him They were the one in
[1:00:40] chains That's right Amen Because they
[1:00:42] were still in their sins They were still
[1:00:44] in unbelief So the so the one who was
[1:00:46] bound was actually free and the ones who
[1:00:48] thought they are free were actually
[1:00:49] bound And how and how incredible that is
[1:00:52] if you bring it into our day When people
[1:00:54] look at you and I they think well they
[1:00:56] don't do the things that we enjoy They
[1:00:59] must have to you know they're you know
[1:01:00] they're a bunch of legalistic bound
[1:01:02] people How could they be happy I think
[1:01:04] they're just deluded in themselves But
[1:01:06] in reality we're like Paul But we're not
[1:01:08] bound by natural chains We're bound by
[1:01:11] chains of love Amen Why are you a
[1:01:13] Christian Because I love him Amen That's
[1:01:15] it Amen Hallelujah Why do you live this
[1:01:17] kind of life Because I love him Because
[1:01:20] he first loved me It's a love
[1:01:22] relationship That's right Amen I don't
[1:01:24] live this way because I fear hell That's
[1:01:26] right I don't fear this way because I'm
[1:01:28] going to go you know because I might go
[1:01:30] into a great tribulation I I live this
[1:01:32] way because I love him And if I love him
[1:01:35] I want to serve him Amen Hallelujah
[1:01:38] Because he first loved me And so Paul
[1:01:42] was the freest man there Amen And you've
[1:01:45] got to understand they want to put the
[1:01:48] shackles of the world back on you
[1:01:50] because they think it's freedom but
[1:01:52] there's no peace You know someone who's
[1:01:54] free has peace
[1:01:56] Amen I'm talking about peace in here
[1:01:58] Someone who's free is has peace but they
[1:02:01] think you're bound Amen But they're the
[1:02:04] ones who are in chains Amen And that's
[1:02:07] why that's why we got to burn this place
[1:02:09] up and find We have the key to set them
[1:02:12] free Amen So out of love and godly
[1:02:15] concern and prayer we're going to find
[1:02:18] whosoever will let them come
[1:02:21] Amen Because I wouldn't trade this life
[1:02:23] for any kind of life Bill Gates can have
[1:02:25] his billions I I'm more happy with what
[1:02:27] I've got
[1:02:30] Amen
[1:02:32] Now we read there where your treasure is
[1:02:37] there your heart will be also Jesus
[1:02:39] speaking That's very
[1:02:42] interesting This word
[1:02:44] treasure it means it means a deposit
[1:02:47] This is in the Greek It means a deposit
[1:02:49] That is wealth Literally or figuratively
[1:02:53] a treasure So it's where your depositor
[1:02:56] is It's it's where you have put your
[1:02:59] investment Amen Have you put your
[1:03:01] investment down here or have you put
[1:03:04] your investment Remember you are the
[1:03:06] investment because you've pledged
[1:03:07] yourself Amen Amen I've pledged
[1:03:10] allegiance to the lamb with all my
[1:03:12] strength with all I am And so it's up to
[1:03:15] you Have Have you have you pledged your
[1:03:17] deposit down here or have you pledge
[1:03:20] your given your treasure up there Amen
[1:03:23] Where have you given it Because a
[1:03:25] because a definition of a deposit is a
[1:03:29] sum payable is the first installment on
[1:03:31] the purchase of something or as a pledge
[1:03:34] for a
[1:03:35] contract Amen So where have you where
[1:03:39] your treasure is where your deposit is
[1:03:42] that's where your heart will be
[1:03:44] Amen
[1:03:46] So I'm not building earthly treasure
[1:03:48] Sure we got to naturally look after our
[1:03:51] families all these things but my
[1:03:53] treasures are not here
[1:03:55] Amen My treasures are in heaven Because
[1:03:58] where your treasure is that's where your
[1:04:00] heart will be also And now your
[1:04:03] heart this word
[1:04:06] heart the heart is
[1:04:10] figuratively the thoughts or feelings of
[1:04:13] the
[1:04:14] mind Yeah And so where your treasure is
[1:04:18] that's where your thoughts and feelings
[1:04:20] will be There's just this word this
[1:04:22] Greek word heart here Yeah So if your if
[1:04:25] your treasures are upon this world
[1:04:28] that's where your heart is towards
[1:04:31] Amen But if your treasures are in heaven
[1:04:34] that's your heart is
[1:04:36] heavenwood
[1:04:38] Amen So wherever your treasures are
[1:04:40] that's where your heart will
[1:04:43] be Now we read in Joshua I just want to
[1:04:49] tie these things a bit together We read
[1:04:51] in Joshua that Joshua was commanded to
[1:04:54] take Israel over the river Jordan place
[1:04:56] them in their inheritance
[1:04:59] that was their place in the promised
[1:05:00] land Now so during the time when Israel
[1:05:05] was being placed in their inheritance
[1:05:07] the commission came to do
[1:05:09] so But the commission really was to be
[1:05:13] courageous to keep the whole word of God
[1:05:16] I know Chad Lamb mentioned that in a
[1:05:18] blended religion ser I just want to
[1:05:20] expand upon that thought The commission
[1:05:22] was to be courageous and the
[1:05:25] courageousness was to keep the whole
[1:05:26] word Yeah So we are
[1:05:30] commanded So we have to be courageous
[1:05:33] You understand We have to be courageous
[1:05:35] to keep the whole word Not to say "Well
[1:05:37] we believe in the Lord." Not to say
[1:05:39] "Well we we're Christians." But we have
[1:05:42] to be courageous to keep the whole word
[1:05:44] Amen Amen Not just a part of it Not just
[1:05:47] the bits that make us feel happy but the
[1:05:49] whole word of God Amen You understand
[1:05:52] And we're living in a we're living in a
[1:05:54] day and hour where the bride of Jesus
[1:05:57] Christ is receiving their full
[1:05:59] inheritance
[1:06:01] Amen We're not you know the church has
[1:06:04] has has left Egypt We're no longer in
[1:06:07] the in the wilderness Brother Ram said
[1:06:09] that the Pentecostal fathers they came
[1:06:11] to Kadesh Bara and they said "We can't
[1:06:13] take the land." And that generation had
[1:06:15] to walk around in the wilderness until
[1:06:17] that generation died off And then he
[1:06:19] then he preached a sermon about turning
[1:06:21] northward Speaking of now it's time for
[1:06:24] us to turn northward and cross Jordan
[1:06:26] And he had another sermon speaking about
[1:06:28] as I was with Moses so shall I be with
[1:06:31] thee And he would say that you know he
[1:06:33] he was you know he he had a he had a
[1:06:37] vision of a of the Bible turning over to
[1:06:39] Joshua and a big finger coming down and
[1:06:41] told him to read those verses that we
[1:06:43] read because the church had come to a
[1:06:45] place now where now the bride was coming
[1:06:48] back into its full inheritance Amen Are
[1:06:52] you all following me So the church had
[1:06:55] left the world Amen
[1:06:58] They came out of the Catholicism under
[1:07:00] Luther They came out of Egypt They've
[1:07:03] been through the desert But now there
[1:07:06] was a change in season where the people
[1:07:08] now had to be placed in their land
[1:07:11] Yeah And our land is our pos is is this
[1:07:15] is our land It's not a piece of real
[1:07:17] estate It's our position in Christ Amen
[1:07:20] You understand And so that was and
[1:07:24] because you you must understand his life
[1:07:27] brother Brandham's life is a parable of
[1:07:30] even our
[1:07:31] walk Yeah Because so he is born in the
[1:07:35] world lost and undone He was redeemed
[1:07:39] and then God molded in him shaped him
[1:07:42] and he came down to a season where now
[1:07:45] was the time for the people to take
[1:07:47] their inheritance and and he was placed
[1:07:50] as an adopted son He received the sword
[1:07:53] in his hand Amen The word of God in his
[1:07:56] hand And then now what happened is the
[1:08:00] seals were open The word was open and it
[1:08:02] was preached to the people Pardon me And
[1:08:05] so the word that came down into his hand
[1:08:07] which is this the true interpretation of
[1:08:09] this now it was now preached to the
[1:08:12] people And then so what happens is
[1:08:15] um then what happens is he came to the
[1:08:18] end of his ministry and he said I must
[1:08:21] ride this trail again I'm sorry if I'm I
[1:08:25] hope this all comes together He said I'm
[1:08:26] so basically says I'm going to have
[1:08:28] another ministry again I'll ride this
[1:08:30] trail again But we understand that David
[1:08:32] in the Psalms when he cried out "My God
[1:08:35] my God why has thou forsaken me They've
[1:08:37] pierced my hands and my feet." It wasn't
[1:08:40] David that was the one that was forsaken
[1:08:42] by God His hands and feet were never
[1:08:44] pierced But it was David was anointed by
[1:08:47] the spirit of God and he was looking at
[1:08:49] Calvary But because it was God anointing
[1:08:51] him in such a way he was speaking in
[1:08:53] first person You understand So many
[1:08:56] times in the scripture as we heard
[1:08:58] Wednesday it'll be the person will be
[1:09:00] speaking in first person but it's a
[1:09:02] prophecy for a future event So when he
[1:09:05] said "Now I must ride this trail again,"
[1:09:07] it was God not speaking about brother
[1:09:10] Baram having another ministry But that
[1:09:12] same anointing that was in him now was
[1:09:15] going to write a book of acts in a
[1:09:17] people after his ministry Amen So I say
[1:09:20] God was saying now I must repeat the
[1:09:23] same this same walk That's right Amen
[1:09:26] Because to ride a trail it means you've
[1:09:28] already you've already gone down gone
[1:09:30] down that trail And so the first time
[1:09:32] that the spirit of God took a man down
[1:09:34] that trail is he brought him to adoption
[1:09:37] He placed a sword in his hand and he
[1:09:39] placed him in his position in Christ
[1:09:41] Amen You following me And so God is
[1:09:44] going to ride that trail again is that
[1:09:46] he'll take a out of the world Amen Born
[1:09:49] in sin shaped in iniquity come to world
[1:09:51] speaking lies Amen and the power of the
[1:09:54] cross will be will become a reality in
[1:09:57] them and God will birth them into the
[1:10:00] kingdom and they will walk and they may
[1:10:02] not understand everything that they've
[1:10:04] gone through but just like he went
[1:10:06] through hardship to mold them and shape
[1:10:08] them and to teach him things not because
[1:10:10] God was being mean but God was teaching
[1:10:13] him things Amen Because God had a God
[1:10:16] had a had a had an intent in his mind
[1:10:20] And God because God's intent was I'm
[1:10:22] going to take this man from Kentucky I'm
[1:10:24] going to put in him everything that Adam
[1:10:26] lost as a display
[1:10:28] Amen So he had to go through those
[1:10:31] things because he was going to put
[1:10:32] creative power in that man where he
[1:10:34] could speak a storm out of existence and
[1:10:37] a tumor the size of a grapefruit was
[1:10:39] spoken out of existence The surgeon was
[1:10:41] going to cut it out of his wife and it
[1:10:43] disappeared At the same time he was
[1:10:45] praying Amen Squirrels were created Life
[1:10:48] was given back Amen Amen A woman a woman
[1:10:51] died in a service called Mary And and
[1:10:54] brother Bram said to her son Billy Paul
[1:10:55] "Go pray for her." And he said "No I'm
[1:10:58] scared." And he just cried out "Mary."
[1:11:00] And she came back to life Amen Amen
[1:11:04] That's like that that reminds you of
[1:11:06] Jesus walking to Lazarus's tomb Lazarus
[1:11:08] come forth Amen Because it wasn't it
[1:11:11] wasn't it was the God in the man You
[1:11:15] understand It's not the man It's the God
[1:11:17] in the man He says "I'm just your
[1:11:18] brother I'm as helpless as can be." But
[1:11:20] when he comes Amen It's the same thing
[1:11:23] with you and I we walk because his life
[1:11:27] was a parable You understand And we
[1:11:30] don't understand everything that we go
[1:11:32] through But you've got to have the end
[1:11:35] result in mind And that will give you
[1:11:39] closure for everything that you've
[1:11:40] walked through in life Amen What is the
[1:11:43] end result You're placed in your
[1:11:46] position in Christ Every enem is under
[1:11:48] your feet Amen You are built into the
[1:11:51] fullness of the stature of Christ Amen
[1:11:54] So what you see in Jesus now you see in
[1:11:56] a many membered body Amen With the same
[1:11:59] nature the same character
[1:12:02] That's his end result Amen because he
[1:12:05] wants to restore dominion back to man
[1:12:07] again over sickness over
[1:12:10] everything That's the end result And a
[1:12:13] people taking a rapture Remember that's
[1:12:15] the fullness of the inheritance is the
[1:12:17] body change Yep That's the end result So
[1:12:20] you've got to keep that in mind when you
[1:12:22] go through hardship because that is what
[1:12:24] God wants to do for you Amen And that to
[1:12:27] me will give you well me personally that
[1:12:29] gives me a lot of closure because I
[1:12:31] might not understand the the individual
[1:12:34] event Why did I why did this have to
[1:12:36] happen But it's because he had an end
[1:12:38] result in mind Amen Amen Remember God
[1:12:42] doesn't just force you through a pipe
[1:12:43] and spit you out the other side and now
[1:12:45] you're overcoming You've got to learn
[1:12:47] things Your heart's going to be molded
[1:12:49] and shaped in your thinking Man man's
[1:12:51] thinking's got to be changed You know I
[1:12:54] think it was brother Andy I think
[1:12:56] someone was having a go to Yo yo your
[1:12:58] brain washed He says yeah my brain
[1:13:00] needed a wash
[1:13:03] Amen My brain needed a shot It needed a
[1:13:06] real good wash Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:13:09] Amen Thank God for his cleansing power
[1:13:11] Amen And so and so brother Bram came to
[1:13:14] a point now where now the church has to
[1:13:18] cross Jordan and be placed in its
[1:13:21] inheritance And but the challenge was
[1:13:24] now
[1:13:25] Be strong and very courageous that thou
[1:13:28] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:13:31] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:13:34] thee Amen That's the challenge And the
[1:13:38] challenge
[1:13:39] was do not turn to the left side or to
[1:13:42] the right side Yeah Meditate upon the
[1:13:45] whole whole word And if you do this then
[1:13:49] you'll be successful So he's basically
[1:13:52] saying have a Christ centered life Amen
[1:13:54] have a oh that sounds very nice have a
[1:13:57] word centered life you understand well
[1:14:00] what does that mean everything you do in
[1:14:02] life is centered around this it's not by
[1:14:05] remember your will your human will and
[1:14:09] god's will are very different things
[1:14:12] amen Paul I think I read I read in the
[1:14:14] family altar where Paul said you know he
[1:14:19] spoke about when when when I would do
[1:14:22] good evil is present
[1:14:24] Yeah And what he and and brother Bram
[1:14:27] explained that he said your body says
[1:14:29] I'm tired I can't do it I'm weary I'm
[1:14:32] busy I'm stressed Yeah That's the evil
[1:14:35] being present because your body wants to
[1:14:37] do one thing but your soul wants to do
[1:14:39] the other thing And it depends what you
[1:14:42] yield yourself to That's the way you're
[1:14:44] going to go Amen We have to drag I have
[1:14:47] to drag this guy into a rapture
[1:14:51] Amen I got to make this guy This guy
[1:14:53] brother Bram said the greatest enemy I
[1:14:55] have is William Brandham
[1:14:57] not Satan not the hordes of hell He said
[1:15:02] this flesh Now we're not
[1:15:04] schizophrenic Amen But you got to
[1:15:07] understand this guy wants to be lazy He
[1:15:10] want He doesn't want to he don't he he
[1:15:12] doesn't want to pray He doesn't want to
[1:15:14] read the Bible He doesn't want to think
[1:15:17] on things of thoughts above because he's
[1:15:19] earthly man But your soul if you're
[1:15:22] remember if you have that typos you're
[1:15:24] absolute Amen This guy and if you yield
[1:15:28] then this guy will have preeminence
[1:15:31] But depend but but it's your power of
[1:15:33] choice is up to which way you want to
[1:15:37] go I'll just read
[1:15:39] this This is the infallible word of God
[1:15:42] in 56 The plan of God is finished The
[1:15:46] atonement's made The devil is defeated
[1:15:48] The only thing we have to do is look and
[1:15:50] live Amen That sounds pretty pretty
[1:15:54] particular He says "Brother sister
[1:15:56] tonight may God of heaven help you to
[1:15:57] look and live as we pray now and bow our
[1:16:00] heads." And then he prays our heavenly
[1:16:02] father as we come to the close now of
[1:16:04] this little mixed up message as a
[1:16:05] parable But let the let the people Lord
[1:16:08] take it home with them and ponder it in
[1:16:10] their heart and knowing that we can rest
[1:16:12] assure if we're built on the material
[1:16:15] out of the Bible that every plan of our
[1:16:18] salvation comes from thus sayeth the
[1:16:19] Lord and we know we're correct and then
[1:16:22] and then Father I pray that in
[1:16:24] vindication of this that I have said
[1:16:26] that there is none other no way under
[1:16:28] heaven not another name under heaven
[1:16:31] that man must be saved only through the
[1:16:33] name of the Lord Jesus whom was the
[1:16:35] expans expansion between heavens and
[1:16:38] earth as he was expanded up there He is
[1:16:41] the mighty tower The name of the Lord is
[1:16:42] the mighty tower The righteous run into
[1:16:44] it and are safe We thank thee Father
[1:16:46] that that we have found this And we pray
[1:16:50] that you're blessed
[1:16:51] tonight
[1:16:54] Amen So the plan is it's finished The
[1:16:57] devil's defeated The plan of God is
[1:16:59] finished You just got to look and live
[1:17:01] So I said it's it's it's up to your
[1:17:03] choosing Am I going to Am I going to
[1:17:05] listen to him and his devices Remember
[1:17:08] he has a lot of shiny things Satan's got
[1:17:11] a lot of shiny things
[1:17:14] Amen God doesn't have shiny things like
[1:17:17] he
[1:17:17] does But so don't be distracted by shiny
[1:17:21] things You know one of the one of the
[1:17:24] problems if it can be called a problem
[1:17:27] in this society is we have too much We
[1:17:30] have too much We eat better
[1:17:33] than you know we we have better food
[1:17:36] than you'd say like the emperors of Rome
[1:17:38] or some great big emperor from way back
[1:17:41] when We eat way better than those kind
[1:17:43] of people What do you feel like today
[1:17:45] honey I feel like Turkish or let's make
[1:17:49] sushi or I feel like uh how about some
[1:17:53] Mexican or let's you know what do you
[1:17:57] want Um no let's go make a curry And
[1:17:59] then you go get the proper spices You
[1:18:01] get all the real authentic stuff and
[1:18:03] then you can make it They can never do
[1:18:04] those things
[1:18:06] Amen They can never just just just have
[1:18:08] a big banquet And what are we doing Well
[1:18:11] we're having we're having venison on a
[1:18:13] charcoal bri and we have this and we
[1:18:15] have you know they never ate that well
[1:18:18] Amen Amen They never ate that well
[1:18:22] But we have too much really
[1:18:26] Amen Are we better off Are we better off
[1:18:29] with all these things or we better off
[1:18:32] just with the Lord
[1:18:35] Amen
[1:18:36] Then that's and that's why we have to be
[1:18:38] careful
[1:18:40] you know because this world is so soft
[1:18:43] soaked easy Yeah But God wants us rugged
[1:18:48] Amen Amen So we can you know Paul even
[1:18:50] told Timothy endure hardness as a
[1:18:52] soldier
[1:18:54] You know so he says you got to you know
[1:18:56] you need a bit of ruggedness about
[1:18:59] you And that's the challenge Joshua said
[1:19:02] "Keep all the word that you may observe
[1:19:05] to do all the law." Yeah And that's why
[1:19:08] they had to be courageous And remember
[1:19:10] that same anointing that was upon Joshua
[1:19:13] to place the people in the land is the
[1:19:15] same anointing that is here present
[1:19:17] because remember the church the church
[1:19:20] went back into Babylon came out you know
[1:19:23] because it was buried underneath
[1:19:24] Catholicism and has come out now and in
[1:19:27] this very day and hour of the people
[1:19:28] being placed in the land Yeah This is
[1:19:31] the hour where we receive our full
[1:19:33] inheritance This is the hour for it Yeah
[1:19:37] And so now that same anointing that was
[1:19:41] back there is now present here Amen
[1:19:44] So if that is the case then the same
[1:19:47] commission that Joshua received really
[1:19:49] is passed on to you and I And you can
[1:19:52] even read about that when Joshua at the
[1:19:54] end of the book of Joshua when Joshua's
[1:19:56] about to die his last commandment to
[1:19:58] Israel is virtually the same that God
[1:20:00] gave him in in in chapter one Don't turn
[1:20:03] a left or right from the word Meditate
[1:20:05] upon the whole word of God you'll be
[1:20:07] successful because I still had more land
[1:20:09] to possess
[1:20:11] Yeah So we should never be satisfied
[1:20:14] with the walk we have
[1:20:16] You understand We should be We should be
[1:20:18] thankful we're in the land Who's in the
[1:20:20] land Who's in Christ Amen We should be
[1:20:23] thankful we're in the land but there's
[1:20:24] more land to possess There's more
[1:20:27] enemies to be driven out Amen There's
[1:20:30] more of this first human nature to be
[1:20:32] defeated
[1:20:34] Amen And we should never just plateau
[1:20:36] and say "Well now we know it all."
[1:20:40] Amen Because there's more to the word
[1:20:43] There's more to the word than just "Well
[1:20:45] now I understand just the core
[1:20:47] doctrine." Because a lot of the time we
[1:20:49] can be you know let's just go to Romans
[1:20:52] I believe it was Romans chapter
[1:21:01] 6 The time
[1:21:13] No Yes Where is
[1:21:16] it I believe it's Hebrews chapter 6
[1:21:25] Sorry I just want you to get a
[1:21:27] hunger Brother Bram said "Pray for
[1:21:30] revelation above all things." above all
[1:21:33] things We're not here just to possess
[1:21:36] part of the
[1:21:37] inheritance Yeah we should remember the
[1:21:40] kingdom is taken The violent take the
[1:21:42] kingdom by force And that doesn't mean
[1:21:44] physically take a sword and invade a
[1:21:46] place but the violent take the kingdom
[1:21:49] of heaven by force Yeah So it's those
[1:21:53] who who remember it's just like the
[1:21:55] unjust judge the parable of the unjust
[1:21:57] judge There's a widow woman and she's
[1:21:59] been wronged and there's an unjust judge
[1:22:02] and he doesn't help her straight away So
[1:22:06] she just keeps after him all the time
[1:22:09] When are you going to avenge me When are
[1:22:10] you going to make this right And then
[1:22:12] and then the just says "Well I better do
[1:22:14] something in case she wearies me." Amen
[1:22:17] And God said you know and our God is not
[1:22:20] an unjust judge but he's giving a
[1:22:23] principle you know press in If you don't
[1:22:26] get an answer the first time press in
[1:22:29] And if you get a no say thank you Amen
[1:22:32] If you get a yes say thank you Amen Amen
[1:22:34] But don't just you know press in
[1:22:38] Amen Press in Take God You know we
[1:22:42] shouldn't just sit back Remember this
[1:22:44] world is
[1:22:45] easy I could go on the doll I could get
[1:22:50] given a house I could basically wouldn't
[1:22:53] have to leave my house I could just
[1:22:54] order my groceries you know I could
[1:22:56] order them online They can come to
[1:22:58] me you know I could that that could be
[1:23:01] my life because everything's poured out
[1:23:05] given to me But that's not that's not
[1:23:08] how it really should be
[1:23:11] Yeah Amen So don't let don't let the
[1:23:16] culture of the age the spirit of the age
[1:23:18] affect your spiritual walk
[1:23:21] Are you following me Because if we do
[1:23:24] that then we will begin to just get lazy
[1:23:27] Amen I want to take a rapture Amen Yeah
[1:23:31] And it doesn't mean you don't work your
[1:23:32] way into the rapture You understand But
[1:23:36] Paul said that I want to apprehend that
[1:23:39] which has apprehended me He's you know
[1:23:42] he speaks about So so he's saying now so
[1:23:46] what apprehended him The Lord
[1:23:47] apprehended him Lord who are you on the
[1:23:50] road to Damascus I'm Jesus whom
[1:23:52] persecuted So the Lord got a hold of him
[1:23:54] and he says many times Paul a prisoner
[1:23:56] of Jesus Christ because he became a love
[1:23:58] prisoner Amen So he and if you're a
[1:24:01] prisoner in shackles you're apprehended
[1:24:04] But he said now I want to apprehend that
[1:24:06] which is apprehended me And here was a
[1:24:09] man here was a man who wrote most of the
[1:24:11] New Testament
[1:24:13] He received abundance of
[1:24:15] revelation but it didn't satisfy him He
[1:24:18] wanted more
[1:24:20] He wasn't trying to earn us He knew he
[1:24:23] was sealed into the kingdom He says "A
[1:24:24] crown of life awaits me over there." So
[1:24:27] he wasn't worried about where he's going
[1:24:30] but he wanted more of what God had for
[1:24:32] him
[1:24:33] Yeah And it should be the same thing
[1:24:35] with us There should something There
[1:24:37] should be something in us that we want
[1:24:39] to apprehend that which has apprehended
[1:24:41] us Amen Who loves to spend time with
[1:24:44] their spouse
[1:24:47] Amen Why is that Because you love them
[1:24:49] Amen Yeah You want to spend time with
[1:24:51] them You want to try and get to know
[1:24:53] them better Amen Absolutely And if that
[1:24:58] is just an earthly marriage how much
[1:24:59] more now you and the Lord
[1:25:03] Amen
[1:25:05] So it says here in Hebrews chapter 6
[1:25:07] verse one therefore leaving the
[1:25:08] principles of the doctrine of
[1:25:11] Christ let us go unto
[1:25:14] perfection not laying in the foundation
[1:25:17] of repentance from dead works and of
[1:25:18] faith towards God of the doctrine of
[1:25:22] baptisms and of the laying on of hands
[1:25:25] which is praying for the sick and of
[1:25:27] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[1:25:31] judgment For this we will do if God
[1:25:36] permit So Paul is telling the Hebrews he
[1:25:40] says let us leave the principles of
[1:25:43] doctrine of Christ That doesn't mean
[1:25:45] throw them away He that doesn't what he
[1:25:48] mean by leave He says but let us go on
[1:25:49] from there Yeah So he's laid the
[1:25:52] foundation He's laid the principles of
[1:25:54] the doctrine Amen Yeah
[1:25:57] which is you know repentance faith
[1:26:01] towards God
[1:26:03] baptism healing laying on of hands
[1:26:05] resurrection of the dead all the all the
[1:26:07] fundamentals of the faith He says go
[1:26:10] beyond those things He doesn't say throw
[1:26:13] them away We need those things If you're
[1:26:15] not built on the foundation of faith
[1:26:18] you're you're you're only built on
[1:26:20] mental
[1:26:21] revelation Amen So he says you we have
[1:26:25] to so we need those principles but we
[1:26:28] got to go beyond those things Yeah It's
[1:26:30] just like Israel they crossed Jordan
[1:26:32] They took Jericho but let's go
[1:26:35] beyond Amen Let's take all the land
[1:26:39] Let's just not be satisfied with what we
[1:26:41] have Let's go be you know let's go
[1:26:43] beyond these
[1:26:45] things And Paul was calling the Hebrews
[1:26:48] to a greater walk with
[1:26:50] God And we are living in the same time
[1:26:54] because the Hebrews and I think I've
[1:26:56] said this before but the book of Hebrews
[1:26:58] now these these Hebrews who know Jewish
[1:27:01] believers they've come out of they've
[1:27:03] come out of Judaism I could say they've
[1:27:06] come out of
[1:27:07] denominationalism Yeah And now they've
[1:27:09] come into this new faith and Paul is
[1:27:13] constantly telling them let us go beyond
[1:27:15] the camp You know Jesus's sacrifice is
[1:27:19] greater than that of the blood of bulls
[1:27:21] and goats Him being the high priest unto
[1:27:23] like like Melisedc is greater than the
[1:27:25] Levitical priesthood Amen He's always
[1:27:29] contrasting what we have now is greater
[1:27:31] than what we had before He's always
[1:27:33] making this contrast It's because what
[1:27:36] was happening is these Hebrews that had
[1:27:38] come out of Judaism what was happening
[1:27:40] in that day is the blindness was coming
[1:27:42] upon Israel because the Gentiles were
[1:27:44] coming in Yep And you got to be careful
[1:27:48] that you don't get caught up in that
[1:27:50] blindness
[1:27:52] because the opposite is happening in
[1:27:53] this day The Gentiles are being blinded
[1:27:56] that because the Jews are going to come
[1:27:58] in very soon
[1:28:00] You understand But because there's a
[1:28:02] blindness coming upon the Gentiles you
[1:28:04] don't want to get caught up in that
[1:28:06] blindness
[1:28:07] What is part of that blindness I have it
[1:28:09] all Everything's fine
[1:28:12] Amen There should be a yearning I know
[1:28:15] we're busy We got children all those
[1:28:16] things But there should be something in
[1:28:18] here I want more of you Lord
[1:28:22] I want more of you Amen
[1:28:26] Amen Amen So that's why he always
[1:28:28] contrasted what we have now is greater
[1:28:30] than what you had under the blood of
[1:28:32] bulls and goats And then now history has
[1:28:35] repeated itself because it's very
[1:28:36] important for us that we must recognize
[1:28:39] what we have now is better than what we
[1:28:41] had than what we came out of Amen Amen
[1:28:45] Because we don't just have a partial
[1:28:47] atonement of of the word mixed with
[1:28:49] creed Amen And just learning some Bible
[1:28:53] Bible studies and these things but we
[1:28:55] now have a living God Amen That the that
[1:28:58] the pure word of God is greater than
[1:29:00] that mixed with man's ideas Amen Amen
[1:29:03] That now the power of the cross has come
[1:29:05] into its full manifestation Amen Because
[1:29:08] now the ability has been released upon
[1:29:10] the earth for people to live above sin
[1:29:12] like never before Hallelujah Amen
[1:29:15] Remember the remember the Ephesian
[1:29:16] church they aimed at becoming what we
[1:29:19] are called to become the fullness of the
[1:29:21] stature of Christ but they relaxed
[1:29:23] because of Ephesus means aimed at but
[1:29:25] relaxed So they aimed at the high
[1:29:27] calling but they relaxed Amen So they
[1:29:31] came they crossed Jordan but they didn't
[1:29:33] take the fullness of the land Yeah But
[1:29:36] now we're called we have come back
[1:29:40] History has repeated itself now where
[1:29:42] there's a people upon the earth that
[1:29:44] have crossed Jordan Amen They've taken
[1:29:46] part of the land Amen But there but now
[1:29:49] instead of shrinking back and saying "We
[1:29:51] cannot take it." There's a people upon
[1:29:53] the earth saying "Now I'm going to take
[1:29:54] it." Amen Amen Everything that God
[1:29:58] everything that God has allotted to the
[1:30:00] church has been released to us
[1:30:02] And that's why it's important when you
[1:30:05] see the opening of the seals now is
[1:30:07] because part inheritance as we heard on
[1:30:09] Wednesday was sealed up and John was
[1:30:11] told in Revelation chapter 10 seal up
[1:30:14] those things says I was about to write
[1:30:16] it So he would have written down what it
[1:30:18] was and he would have sent it to the
[1:30:20] seven churches because he was an
[1:30:22] obedient scribe but God told him seal up
[1:30:25] those things until the time of the end
[1:30:29] Yeah Now I'm in Daniel chapter 12 Daniel
[1:30:33] saw that sealed book as well And he he's
[1:30:36] asking God "When are these things going
[1:30:37] to happen?" He said "Seal up those
[1:30:40] things until the time of the end many
[1:30:43] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:30:45] increase."
[1:30:47] Running to and fro in the Bible
[1:30:48] languages travel
[1:30:51] When in the like like this past century
[1:30:53] or past 50 years can you you say "Where
[1:30:57] do you want breakfast?"
[1:30:59] Oh let's go to let's go to Nusa for
[1:31:01] breakfast Let's go to Queensland for
[1:31:02] breakfast Where do you want dinner Let's
[1:31:04] go to Sydney Oh let's go around the
[1:31:06] world You know and people complain it
[1:31:08] takes me 48 hours to travel around the
[1:31:10] world Used to take months
[1:31:13] Amen You know this this day that that
[1:31:17] scripture is fulfilled When has
[1:31:18] knowledge increased In a short space of
[1:31:20] time there's a horse and buggy to a man
[1:31:22] up in space It wasn't that long
[1:31:27] And our cell phones our computers have
[1:31:30] more computing power than I think the
[1:31:32] the lander that put the Americans on the
[1:31:35] moon And it's just this little
[1:31:37] thing No it's just gone exponential Look
[1:31:40] up He said when these things happen he
[1:31:42] said that's the time when the when the
[1:31:44] inheritance is going to be released Amen
[1:31:46] Amen And it's been open Amen Yeah The
[1:31:50] full inheritance of the people of God
[1:31:52] has been open And
[1:31:54] so that's why there's such a contrast
[1:31:57] What we have now is
[1:32:00] greater It is more It's not taking away
[1:32:02] from what God did in past ages It's just
[1:32:05] greater than what they had And what the
[1:32:07] light that they lived in God will you
[1:32:10] know God redeem people under that light
[1:32:13] Yeah Because they're only held
[1:32:15] accountable for what they had in future
[1:32:16] ages But this is another age Amen Amen
[1:32:20] This is another time And so God has
[1:32:23] called us
[1:32:25] now because the word because the word
[1:32:28] has been
[1:32:29] opened Now is the
[1:32:32] time when the when the full inheritance
[1:32:35] everything Adam lost now has been given
[1:32:37] back to the
[1:32:38] church
[1:32:40] Okay And so that's why it's important to
[1:32:44] recognize what we have is greater than
[1:32:46] even Pentecost What we have is even
[1:32:49] greater than the first church age
[1:32:51] because the first church age remember
[1:32:53] aimed at but relaxed Amen But now we're
[1:32:57] called to aim at but become Amen Amen
[1:33:00] Amen Because this age that we live in is
[1:33:03] a lot harder age than than that
[1:33:06] time
[1:33:08] Yeah But now we have a power now God has
[1:33:11] released an anointing upon the church
[1:33:13] for us to overcome all things and to
[1:33:16] possess all things But now the
[1:33:18] commission given to us now is that we
[1:33:21] would be very courageous to keep the
[1:33:23] whole word
[1:33:25] Amen That's why it's important to to dig
[1:33:28] into these things Amen To to to delve
[1:33:32] into these things and really see what he
[1:33:34] said
[1:33:35] It's important because that's the
[1:33:37] inheritance now and it's now being
[1:33:39] distributed to
[1:33:44] you Now let's go
[1:33:47] to and also as I said now well so where
[1:33:51] your heart is where your treasure is
[1:33:54] that's where your heart will
[1:33:55] be and it's come down to a point now
[1:33:59] that man is reflecting either two worlds
[1:34:02] you're reflecting heaven you're either
[1:34:05] reflecting heaven or
[1:34:07] hell Amen And so the believer but it's
[1:34:10] where your it's where your treasure is I
[1:34:13] say "Is it on upon this earth or is it
[1:34:16] from heaven?" And so now because what's
[1:34:18] happened is God through the ages has
[1:34:21] been building up a people in his very
[1:34:23] image Yeah Are you with me And so now
[1:34:27] there's a people upon the earth that
[1:34:30] have the character of God in them The
[1:34:34] very life that was in Christ is now in
[1:34:36] you Amen And so now the believer that's
[1:34:39] been born again is reflecting heaven
[1:34:44] Amen When you walk down the street when
[1:34:46] you go to your job whatever you're doing
[1:34:47] you create an atmosphere around you Amen
[1:34:51] And some people you know some people
[1:34:53] unfortunately you go around them and you
[1:34:55] don't want to be around them because
[1:34:56] they have an atmosphere
[1:34:58] And there's some people you love to be
[1:35:00] around because they have a certain kind
[1:35:01] of atmosphere
[1:35:03] Yeah Because we're all atmosphere
[1:35:05] creators
[1:35:07] But it's up to you now It's where your
[1:35:09] treasure is That's the kind of
[1:35:11] atmosphere you'll create
[1:35:14] You with me
[1:35:16] Now I'm not going to be too much longer
[1:35:18] I just want to read one more
[1:35:22] thing
[1:35:24] now It says let's go to second Peter
[1:35:28] chapter 1
[1:35:52] Now second Peter chapter
[1:35:55] 1 and verse one
[1:36:02] Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of
[1:36:04] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[1:36:07] like precious faith with us through the
[1:36:08] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:36:11] Jesus Christ Pardon me Grace and peace
[1:36:14] be multiplied unto you through the
[1:36:15] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[1:36:18] according as his divine power hath given
[1:36:22] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:36:24] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:36:27] of
[1:36:27] him that hath called us to glory and
[1:36:31] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:36:33] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:36:36] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:36:39] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:36:42] corruption that is in the world through
[1:36:44] lust I was going to stop there for a
[1:36:46] little bit So he's so so Peter is
[1:36:50] speaking to a people and he's really
[1:36:51] speaking to
[1:36:53] us because we are called
[1:36:56] now that we would be partakers of the
[1:36:59] divine nature So we would be partakers
[1:37:01] of God's own nature Yeah Because
[1:37:04] remember I say this the people in ISIS
[1:37:08] embody their religion They come under
[1:37:10] the same anointing that's released
[1:37:12] through their preaching of hate and they
[1:37:14] go blow themselves up to all kinds of
[1:37:16] atrocities because they embody that
[1:37:18] religion
[1:37:20] Yeah And everyone who's ever sold
[1:37:22] themselves to what kind of religion They
[1:37:24] embody that religion And what it is is a
[1:37:27] counterfeit of the real You following me
[1:37:30] So now if if God is if Jesus Christ is
[1:37:34] the Lord he is the real true and living
[1:37:37] God then his true followers will embody
[1:37:41] him Yep That his spirit will now come
[1:37:44] and dwell in them and they will
[1:37:47] embody this
[1:37:49] Yep It's just like ISIS They they send
[1:37:51] out their words and people come under
[1:37:54] that anointing and they now live out the
[1:37:56] words in their books And that's why they
[1:37:58] murder people and do all kinds of things
[1:38:00] And so it'll be the same now for a for
[1:38:03] the true and living God that when God
[1:38:06] releases his word there'll be a people
[1:38:08] that come under the anointing and
[1:38:09] they'll embody those
[1:38:11] words And that is all really summed up
[1:38:14] in the character of the
[1:38:16] people Amen It's not in how much you
[1:38:19] know or what you think you know It's
[1:38:21] your character Has it been molded and
[1:38:23] shaped into his character
[1:38:26] That is that is that is the great thing
[1:38:29] because it's when your character is
[1:38:31] molded and shaped into his that's when
[1:38:33] you know you're possessing the land Amen
[1:38:36] Amen As you become more like him
[1:38:43] Now he says this now I just he says now
[1:38:50] having escaped the corruption that's in
[1:38:51] the world through
[1:38:52] lust and brother Bam says lust for money
[1:38:56] lust for big things lust for popularity
[1:38:59] these things are dead to the believer
[1:39:02] Amen If if if you have no desire you if
[1:39:06] you have no desire for those things you
[1:39:08] know those things should be dead
[1:39:10] Remember where your treasure is that's
[1:39:13] where your heart is Yeah We don't care a
[1:39:18] tent or a cottage Why should I care Live
[1:39:21] or die sink or drown This is the thing
[1:39:24] that I'm interested in The kingdom of
[1:39:25] God Whether I maintain my home whether I
[1:39:29] maintain my family whether I maintain
[1:39:34] whatever whatever it is let me remain
[1:39:37] let me remain Christ the hope of glory
[1:39:40] Build me up oh Lord into this Let Christ
[1:39:43] be my head Let working let working
[1:39:47] through me on my foundation of my faith
[1:39:49] that's in him Let virtue knowledge
[1:39:51] temperance patience godliness and
[1:39:53] brotherly kindness work in me oh Lord is
[1:39:55] my prayer I don't care live or die sink
[1:39:58] or drown denomination no denomination
[1:40:00] friend or no friend Let that work in me
[1:40:03] Let Christ's virtue his knowledge his
[1:40:06] flowing out that I might be able to
[1:40:08] teach those for God has set in the
[1:40:10] church apostles prophets teachers
[1:40:11] pastors and evangelists all for the
[1:40:13] perfecting and the bringing all these
[1:40:15] virtues into it to that perfection of
[1:40:18] the coming uh of the son of God Each one
[1:40:21] of these stones are material off of that
[1:40:24] one This is the material of this Each
[1:40:27] one of these virtues belonging to him
[1:40:30] and they're pouring out of him down
[1:40:31] through them And he says amen So he's
[1:40:34] saying now those virtues he's saying so
[1:40:37] the seven virtues which we will read
[1:40:40] there in second Peter he says those
[1:40:42] things flow from Christ through the
[1:40:44] ministry into the people Remember
[1:40:46] because the people embody the words that
[1:40:48] come out of whatever is being preached
[1:40:52] Amen I got to find second Peter again
[1:41:13] Okay So
[1:41:15] now and besides
[1:41:19] this giving all
[1:41:21] diligence Okay So don't be slack about
[1:41:24] it Give all diligence Remember if you
[1:41:27] want a good home be strong in the Lord
[1:41:30] If you want a good marriage be strong in
[1:41:32] the Lord If you want a good relationship
[1:41:34] with your kids be strong in the Lord And
[1:41:36] then if that is the center now
[1:41:38] everything else will live out of that
[1:41:40] She'll have a better relationship with
[1:41:41] your wife or your or your husband
[1:41:43] because you're strong in the Lord You'll
[1:41:45] be able to get alongside your kids and
[1:41:47] play with them and spend better time
[1:41:49] with them because you're strong in the
[1:41:50] Lord Because remember our kids are our
[1:41:53] disciples
[1:41:55] Yeah But a disciple is made by an
[1:41:59] example set in front of them Why do
[1:42:02] people turn to the world and they want
[1:42:04] to become the next Beyonce or the
[1:42:06] whatever next big big rock star or
[1:42:09] whatever it is because that life is
[1:42:11] projected in front of them and they
[1:42:13] behold it They say I want to be their
[1:42:16] disciple Basically without saying
[1:42:18] disciple they say I want to be that I
[1:42:20] want to be the next Kardashian or
[1:42:22] whatever kind of train wreck of a life
[1:42:24] Yeah because they see that and they want
[1:42:26] it because it's lived in front of them
[1:42:29] So if you want to make your kids
[1:42:31] disciples of the Lord remember Paul said
[1:42:33] "Follow me as I follow Christ." Yeah So
[1:42:37] because he wasn't a living example of
[1:42:40] this
[1:42:42] So if you want to make them disciples of
[1:42:44] the Lord they need to see a life lived
[1:42:46] in front of them that they want
[1:42:49] Yeah That's why so that's why I said if
[1:42:51] you're strong with if you want a better
[1:42:53] relationship with your kids be strong in
[1:42:55] the Lord Because they will see that now
[1:42:57] being lived out of you Even if they
[1:42:59] can't put their finger upon it they will
[1:43:01] actually say "I want what my parents
[1:43:03] have They may be a bunch of squares but
[1:43:05] I want what they have." Amen Because
[1:43:09] you're salty
[1:43:10] You understand Because that's how you
[1:43:12] make disciples It's anam a life lived
[1:43:15] will make a disciple
[1:43:18] Amen
[1:43:21] So now he says "Giving all
[1:43:25] diligence add to your faith
[1:43:28] virtue." Now your faith is your revealed
[1:43:30] faith in God It's not your mental faith
[1:43:33] Go listen to the statue of the perfect
[1:43:35] man sermon Whatever you do go study
[1:43:37] it And to your faith virtue Now virtue
[1:43:40] is strength Remember Jesus the Yeah The
[1:43:42] woman touched the hem of his garment He
[1:43:43] says "Virtues come out of me." So now
[1:43:46] you have strength to help others
[1:43:49] Okay And knowledge and and to virtue
[1:43:52] knowledge Now that knowledge is heavenly
[1:43:54] knowledge Knowledge of the word Yeah
[1:43:57] Godly
[1:43:58] knowledge And then temperance And to
[1:44:00] your
[1:44:01] temperance is
[1:44:03] patience And to patience godliness And
[1:44:07] to godliness brotherly kindness And to
[1:44:10] brotherly kindness charity And that is
[1:44:13] divine
[1:44:13] love Okay Now brother Bram when he
[1:44:17] preaches that sermon the statue of the
[1:44:19] perfect man and he actually calls the
[1:44:22] sermon building the living tabernacle of
[1:44:25] the living God's dwelling place the
[1:44:26] perfect man That's the real title that
[1:44:28] he calls it Okay So building the living
[1:44:31] tabernacle of the living God's dwelling
[1:44:33] place the perfect man He says that each
[1:44:35] individual is built to be built up into
[1:44:38] this And he and he ties in he ties in
[1:44:42] the virtues now with with the seven
[1:44:45] church ages So now when the when the
[1:44:48] messengers came and they released the
[1:44:51] word to the age now they were releasing
[1:44:54] that virtue to the age Yeah Because
[1:44:57] because the bride because the bride
[1:44:59] started off remember the bride is a many
[1:45:01] many membered body It started off in the
[1:45:04] beginning and now we're the final parts
[1:45:06] of that body coming in all all around
[1:45:08] the world the believers are Amen Yeah
[1:45:11] But then also individually so so
[1:45:13] collectively we are the statue of the
[1:45:16] perfect man is the bride But
[1:45:18] individually we are made in that image
[1:45:20] as
[1:45:21] well Okay Does that is that make sense
[1:45:25] Yeah And so now he so he says that with
[1:45:29] each of these
[1:45:30] messengers these virtues are released He
[1:45:33] says as and see how these virtues these
[1:45:36] building materials typed in with the
[1:45:38] church ages I mean church messengers
[1:45:41] with the church ages So he says that
[1:45:43] they're typed in there So he's saying
[1:45:44] that the the virtues were released when
[1:45:48] the messenger gave the light Yeah For
[1:45:50] for each age But remember the final age
[1:45:53] is to gather every all the truth through
[1:45:55] the first
[1:45:57] six and to release it to the people And
[1:46:00] not only that now but to bring what has
[1:46:03] been sealed in the word to to reveal it
[1:46:06] So now we have the fullness of the word
[1:46:08] now is is present upon the earth Now
[1:46:11] what does that mean It means now that we
[1:46:13] have what we need to be grown into the
[1:46:16] fullness of the statue of Christ
[1:46:19] Okay that's what we have
[1:46:22] So now living in an age now this is
[1:46:25] where I say press in and take your
[1:46:28] inheritance because now we're living in
[1:46:30] an age where what you see saw in Jesus
[1:46:34] now that same character and nature and
[1:46:36] what he did is now you're made into that
[1:46:40] same image It doesn't mean putting on a
[1:46:42] robe and walking along the shore of
[1:46:45] Galilee but that same character and
[1:46:47] nature will be in you
[1:46:50] Yeah
[1:46:52] And if you have so and if that is in you
[1:46:55] now that's why I said before if you have
[1:46:59] your character is molded and shaped more
[1:47:00] like him then to me that shows that you
[1:47:04] are taking your inheritance because
[1:47:07] remember a
[1:47:08] revelation a revelation if you have a
[1:47:11] revelation it will produce Christ's
[1:47:13] character in
[1:47:14] you Yeah remember Moses Moses and the
[1:47:17] Pharisees and I and I'll try and wind up
[1:47:19] with this We still got a bit to go but
[1:47:21] I'll maybe pick up next time Moses and
[1:47:23] the Pharisees they had the first first
[1:47:25] five books of the Bible They had the
[1:47:26] same Bible
[1:47:29] One learned it The scribes and Pharisees
[1:47:30] they learned it Moses it was a
[1:47:32] revelation on Mount Si The word came to
[1:47:34] him Moses became the meakest man in all
[1:47:37] the earth The scribes and Pharisees were
[1:47:40] proud arrogant men
[1:47:42] What was the difference One was learned
[1:47:44] the other was a revelation And he became
[1:47:47] the meakest man in all the earth because
[1:47:48] that was a characteristic of Christ
[1:47:50] being lived out in it Amen That was
[1:47:53] Christ That was Christ's character going
[1:47:55] into Moses But remember before that he
[1:47:58] was raised in Pharaoh's house He was a
[1:48:00] general in the army The royalty in Egypt
[1:48:02] in those days they were gods
[1:48:05] And you wouldn't see a man So so now
[1:48:07] here comes our god of war embodied in
[1:48:09] our general Prince Moses
[1:48:13] You know if he's embodying the God of
[1:48:15] war he's not going to be a little meek
[1:48:17] little fellow He's going to be confident
[1:48:19] He says "We're going to smite these
[1:48:21] Ethiopians We're going to deal with them
[1:48:23] and have such a persona around
[1:48:25] him." And well how did he become the
[1:48:27] meakest man in all the earth Because he
[1:48:29] met the Lord
[1:48:32] And the proof that he met the Lord is
[1:48:33] because his character was changed to
[1:48:35] become the meakest man
[1:48:37] Yeah That's what the word produced in
[1:48:39] him Amen And that is what the word will
[1:48:43] produce in you
[1:48:45] Amen And whatever measure God wants to
[1:48:47] pour it in because we all have different
[1:48:49] He's not going to make our personalities
[1:48:50] all the same Remember he's a he's a he's
[1:48:53] a like you know just like the apostles
[1:48:55] Peter was boisterous and always answered
[1:48:58] first and he was the only one who got
[1:48:59] out of the boat and did all these things
[1:49:01] Paul was more scholarly You know he's a
[1:49:03] different kind of fellow You know some
[1:49:05] of them were more prayer warriors others
[1:49:07] were fire brands but they're all part of
[1:49:10] the church because God made them all
[1:49:13] differently because God uses God God
[1:49:16] makes people that way for us to
[1:49:17] compliment one another
[1:49:20] Yeah But they all had the same kind of
[1:49:22] character because they knew the Lord and
[1:49:24] it produced that character in
[1:49:28] them And that is
[1:49:30] what I just read
[1:49:36] this This is a statue of the perfect man
[1:49:38] Now
[1:49:39] Peter he says he says uh first seven
[1:49:43] things faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:49:47] patience godliness brotherly kindness I
[1:49:49] mean sorry brotherly love and brotherly
[1:49:50] kindness and then the love of God the
[1:49:52] Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the
[1:49:54] Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true
[1:49:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get
[1:49:59] these virtues sealed in you Then God
[1:50:03] lives in a tabernacle called the uh
[1:50:05] called the building the living
[1:50:06] tabernacle the living God's dwelling
[1:50:08] place When a man possesses these kinds
[1:50:10] of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:50:13] them No matter you might speak with
[1:50:15] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[1:50:17] that God's got You might do that but
[1:50:19] until these virtues here go into you
[1:50:23] you're still off the real foundation of
[1:50:27] faith But when these virtues grow in as
[1:50:31] you added that to that then you're a
[1:50:33] living
[1:50:34] monument You're a living moving
[1:50:37] idol But you know the heathens they
[1:50:39] prostrate themselves before an idol and
[1:50:41] an imaginary god And in an imaginary way
[1:50:44] they believe that that imaginary god
[1:50:46] speaks back to them That's heathenism
[1:50:48] That's Romanism They bow before all
[1:50:50] kinds of saints and everything else They
[1:50:52] have St Cecilia house god so many
[1:50:54] different things like that They bow to
[1:50:57] that and actually believe that that in
[1:50:59] an imaginary way Now what a type of it
[1:51:01] is of the true living God When we not in
[1:51:04] an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves
[1:51:07] before a living God a living virtue a
[1:51:09] living knowledge a living patience a
[1:51:11] living godliness a living power coming
[1:51:13] by the living God makes a living man a
[1:51:16] living image the statue of God But
[1:51:17] what's he doing The same things that
[1:51:19] Jesus did Walking the same way he walked
[1:51:22] Doing the same things he did because
[1:51:24] he's not an imaginary thing There's a
[1:51:27] reality that proves it
[1:51:33] Amen And that's that's where we are
[1:51:37] friends Amen We're not Remember the
[1:51:40] devil will tell you it's not for you
[1:51:42] it's for another time
[1:51:44] That's a lie
[1:51:46] Everything that God has released or will
[1:51:48] release to the church is here Amen But
[1:51:52] it's our it's our time to possess all
[1:51:55] things
[1:51:56] Amen That the that Jesus dying on the
[1:51:59] cross what is the purpose that he
[1:52:02] died to to redeem us back to God That
[1:52:06] God would take this fallen nature
[1:52:08] Remember your first don't let your first
[1:52:09] birth dictate your walk with God Your
[1:52:12] first nature don't let it dictate how
[1:52:14] you walk with God Well I'm always this
[1:52:16] way and my granddad was this way and my
[1:52:18] uncle was this way and it's just in my
[1:52:20] is a strain in my family That's only
[1:52:22] with the first birth Amen Amen But the
[1:52:25] second birth the the life of God in you
[1:52:28] is more powerful than this this guy
[1:52:32] Amen But what you but what you yield
[1:52:34] yourself to that is what will be lived
[1:52:36] out And that's why God comes he puts his
[1:52:39] finger He allows circumstance to come
[1:52:41] into your life cuz he puts a finger Just
[1:52:43] say if you got a stubborn streak in your
[1:52:45] family or unforgiving streak or whatever
[1:52:47] it may you know temper whatever it is he
[1:52:50] allows things to happen because he wants
[1:52:51] to put a finger on that thing because he
[1:52:54] wants you to overcome that thing Amen
[1:52:57] Amen That's what he wants to do because
[1:53:00] he wants you to be victorious over it He
[1:53:02] does He's not condemning Remember when
[1:53:04] the when the enemy trips you up God
[1:53:08] didn't let that happen that that he you
[1:53:10] would be condemned by it God allows or
[1:53:14] lets the enemy trip you up because he
[1:53:16] wants you to get up and you to overcome
[1:53:18] that thing That's right As I've said a
[1:53:20] while ago it's just like when you're
[1:53:22] growing a garden and during the winter
[1:53:24] time there can be all kinds of weeds in
[1:53:26] that soil You don't know the weeds are
[1:53:28] there That's right You've planted your
[1:53:30] whatever you've planted And then when
[1:53:31] the temperature is right and the
[1:53:33] atmosphere is right and the and the you
[1:53:35] know there's fertilizer and you water it
[1:53:37] things begin to grow
[1:53:39] And it's only when the weed comes out
[1:53:41] then you can pull the weed
[1:53:43] out Amen And it's the same thing Now we
[1:53:48] come you know the world everyone's
[1:53:51] pretty much dormant but then now the
[1:53:52] spirit of God comes through his word and
[1:53:56] the light begins to shine and water
[1:53:59] comes out upon the soil and things come
[1:54:02] out of people that they really had no
[1:54:03] idea was in there That's right What's
[1:54:05] happening It's a weed But then it it
[1:54:08] comes out not that you'd see you're
[1:54:10] failing but it's that God wants to take
[1:54:12] it out of you Remember he knows what's
[1:54:14] in the heart of every man
[1:54:16] Amen So whenever things happen you say
[1:54:19] "Lord," and you and you completely hate
[1:54:21] yourself for it You know don't sit there
[1:54:24] condemned about it
[1:54:27] But let you remember if
[1:54:31] you It's just like this Bible
[1:54:36] if you wanted to take this Bible off me
[1:54:39] you you really need to come and ask say
[1:54:40] can I take that off you And then it's my
[1:54:43] choice if I'm going to give it to you or
[1:54:46] not If this is I'll use another book If
[1:54:50] this is a lie of the devil and I've
[1:54:53] always carried it
[1:54:55] around and and I carry it around so much
[1:54:58] that I think well it's just part of me
[1:55:00] now because it's just part of what I
[1:55:01] have Just like people's cell phones many
[1:55:03] times these days right as part of
[1:55:06] them But then if the Lord wants to take
[1:55:09] it from me first he's got to actually
[1:55:12] cause me to recognize hey this is
[1:55:13] actually this is a lie of the devil This
[1:55:16] is a bad thing But then it's up to me
[1:55:18] now Am I going to give it to him or not
[1:55:20] Amen
[1:55:22] Amen If I say no this is part of me then
[1:55:26] he's remember he's a gentleman He
[1:55:28] doesn't force anything upon you You have
[1:55:30] to be willing to give it to him
[1:55:33] Yeah And so if he if you say "No I'm
[1:55:35] going to keep on this thing." Well it's
[1:55:37] just going to sit there But why does he
[1:55:39] cause your attention to come to it
[1:55:41] because he wants to take it from
[1:55:43] you Why do why do things happen in life
[1:55:46] and that you know things come out of you
[1:55:48] that you thought were not even there or
[1:55:49] you know because you had to realize
[1:55:51] you're carrying
[1:55:53] things Amen Just like possessing the
[1:55:56] land There's squatters in the land that
[1:55:57] had to be driven out Doesn't mean the
[1:55:59] land's bad It's the squatters that are
[1:56:01] bad Amen Just like a believer doesn't
[1:56:04] mean the believer's bad There squatters
[1:56:06] there There's a first nature that has to
[1:56:08] be taken under dominion
[1:56:10] Amen Let's have some musicians come
[1:56:13] Sorry I need to I need to finish But you
[1:56:16] see that's why bad why do bad things
[1:56:18] remember all Romans 8:28 Put that on
[1:56:21] your fridge All things work together for
[1:56:24] good for those that love God and are
[1:56:27] called according to his purpose Amen
[1:56:30] Amen
[1:56:32] They work together for the good Well I
[1:56:34] don't understand why that happened It
[1:56:36] worked for my good All
[1:56:39] things That doesn't mean some things
[1:56:43] all
[1:56:46] Amen And what is the reason that that
[1:56:48] bad things happen Cuz he wants to he
[1:56:52] wants to he has an end goal in mind
[1:56:53] Remember I said in the beginning mold
[1:56:56] and shape us into his very
[1:56:59] image Amen

[1:57:15] um let's just go to number seven I'm
[1:57:17] amazed that you love
[1:57:20] me We're called to possess all things
[1:57:22] for if you'd like to stand with me
[1:57:24] please
[1:57:27] If there's a deep remember if there's a
[1:57:29] longing in your heart there's more of
[1:57:31] God to have And if there's not a longing
[1:57:34] here you pray say "Lord give me a
[1:57:36] desire."
[1:57:38] Amen Because please do not be satisfied
[1:57:41] with what we have Do not be satisfied in
[1:57:44] your walk I'm not saying you got to get
[1:57:46] saved all over again I'm not talking
[1:57:47] about But there's more of God to have
[1:57:50] Amen Oh but people will think I'm
[1:57:52] overboard They think you're overboard
[1:57:53] anyway Just just forget about what
[1:57:56] anyone else thinks It doesn't
[1:57:58] matter Who cares You don't try and be a
[1:58:01] stumbling block How do you be a
[1:58:02] stumbling block Live in hypocrisy That's
[1:58:05] a stumbling block At least at least if
[1:58:07] people see real Christianity they might
[1:58:09] not like what you have but if trouble
[1:58:11] arises and they have a need they'll come
[1:58:13] to you cuz they know hey these people
[1:58:15] are real true
[1:58:17] blue Amen So that's you know you can't
[1:58:20] really be a stumbling block by just
[1:58:21] being what you are

[2:15:27] come here to be blessed We come here to
[2:15:30] hear the word of the Lord We come here

[2:15:40] prepared to come here on a Sunday

[2:15:48] pastor week in and week out be it a
[2:15:51] witness day be a Sunday be it a
[2:15:55] weekday he's there to listen But when
[2:15:58] he's standing up here and he's preaching
[2:16:00] and he's giving us the word and he's
[2:16:02] teaching us we need to be
[2:16:04] respectful I stand at the back of the
[2:16:06] church and I and and I watch you know
[2:16:08] our families and our children and our
[2:16:10] our our older
[2:16:12] ones What I see is there's lots of
[2:16:14] disturbance There's lots of movement
[2:16:18] When the brothers are praying in front
[2:16:19] of the the movement in the church when
[2:16:22] somebody's standing up in front and
[2:16:24] praying we'd like no movement When the
[2:16:27] spirit of the Lord comes down and he
[2:16:29] takes control in this place our parents
[2:16:31] are busy maybe and our children need to
[2:16:33] respect this They need to be steady and
[2:16:36] steadfast and being patient waiting for
[2:16:39] their parents not walking around When
[2:16:41] our when our brothers are are in praise
[2:16:44] and worship and and and you can feel the

[2:16:49] held close by them The only time our
[2:16:52] children are to be gone to the back or
[2:16:54] to be dismissed is when the pastor or
[2:16:56] the last person prayed and said you are
[2:16:59] dismissed in the name of the Lord Then
[2:17:01] our children should go out of the church
[2:17:03] But otherwise our children should be
[2:17:04] held close to us If they gone out to the
[2:17:06] back to the toilet if they can use the
