[27:02] we're going to have a wonderful time
[27:05] amen amen now I want to I want to
[27:07] continue kind of in another way from
[27:09] from Sunday speaking of speaking of
[27:11] divine leadership and uh I want to I
[27:15] just want to take a thought really from
[27:17] from from those two scriptures that we
[27:19] just
[27:19] read um you know
[27:22] that there's a big change taking place
[27:25] here and you know when when Jesus was
[27:27] upon the Earth there was a change in
[27:30] God's government there was a change in
[27:31] his administration that he was going
[27:34] from a priesthood and and the blood of
[27:35] bulls and gos to now God himself will
[27:37] come and dwell in his people and we
[27:40] understand that you know many people
[27:43] have many people have have assembled
[27:45] armies they've they've given their lives
[27:47] to study and and many people have risen
[27:50] up and they've you know LED Nations into
[27:52] war and many people have conquered many
[27:54] parts of the earth and you know we know
[27:56] like the you know like G KH conquered
[27:59] probably the biggest part of the Earth
[28:00] has been conquered you Alexander the
[28:02] Great took a small arm and he conquered
[28:04] a far bigger nation you see the British
[28:06] Empire you see Napoleon you know all
[28:08] these men had great Ambitions and they
[28:10] had great desires because they wanted a
[28:12] name above every other name they wanted
[28:14] to be remembered upon the Earth but we
[28:16] see that they all actually ended in
[28:18] Failure they did not they could not
[28:20] build a lasting Legacy that could keep
[28:23] you know keep a government or a kingdom
[28:26] together because eventually they
[28:28] kingdoms fell and eventually they became
[28:30] just footnotes in history and so but our
[28:33] God is a very different kind of
[28:35] conqueror you know he's a very different
[28:37] kind of general you know he doesn't just
[28:39] lead from the back he leads from the
[28:40] front and actually he's the one that
[28:42] does the fighting it's not us that does
[28:44] the fighting he does the fighting and so
[28:47] Jesus if you think of it you know
[28:48] apparently I think it was uh Alexander
[28:51] the Great you know he was so you know he
[28:53] you know he came into the Northern parts
[28:54] of India and his men didn't want to go
[28:57] any further they said no let's let's
[28:59] let's turn back and he kind of he you
[29:01] know and then from then on he he
[29:03] basically got really depressed and you
[29:05] know he just went back to Babylon
[29:06] because he had his headquarters there
[29:08] and then he died a drunk you know so he
[29:10] looked at what could be conquered but
[29:12] his men weren't willing to go with him
[29:14] and he turned back and his great
[29:15] Ambitions came to nothing to conquer the
[29:17] world but then we see you know you know
[29:20] in great military campaigns there's a
[29:22] winner and there's a loser but the
[29:23] winner the one who conquers it's always
[29:26] just a limited Victory you know it's
[29:27] just say maybe a pel of ground or maybe
[29:30] a town or maybe they just drove the
[29:31] enemy out of a certain place you know
[29:34] but our God conquered more than just
[29:35] physical you know place our God
[29:38] conquered not only this realm but he
[29:40] conquered hell death in the grave he
[29:42] literally conquered everything that
[29:44] could be conquered amen after he arose
[29:46] the third day with the keys of Hell
[29:48] death and the grave in his hand he had
[29:51] he had the victory amen over everything
[29:54] he conquered sickness when he was here
[29:56] he conquered sty religion when he was
[29:58] here he conquered formalism when he was
[30:00] here he conquered a people you know he
[30:02] conquered a religious system that was
[30:04] just about you know a form and of Creeds
[30:07] and dogmas and things he conquered all
[30:09] of that I mean he conquered death you
[30:11] know when Lazarus was in the grave four
[30:13] days and and Corruption he set in he
[30:15] said Lazarus come forth and and the
[30:18] prophet tells us if he didn't use
[30:20] Lazarus by name if he didn't C lazarous
[30:22] by name there would have been a general
[30:24] Resurrection because the all powerful
[30:26] one and so he called Lazarus forth and
[30:29] Lazarus that was 4 days in the grave his
[30:31] nose fell in all different things were
[30:33] beginning to Decay he came forth healthy
[30:35] and strong and brother Braham tells us
[30:38] that corruption knew its master that day
[30:40] amen amen so every devil had to bow to
[30:43] Jesus Christ amen because Jesus's name
[30:46] is the name above all names amen amen
[30:49] his name because to the name of Jesus
[30:52] Christ every knee must bow everyone will
[30:55] bow to it one day but it's your choice
[30:58] if you'll bow now or you'll bow then
[31:00] because to them who bow now gets you
[31:02] know you know they get his victory amen
[31:05] they get eternal life amen it is the
[31:07] greatest privilege for a man or woman or
[31:09] child to bow to his name now amen
[31:12] because we understand that you know
[31:14] Jesus as a conqueror is not like the
[31:16] Nazis that just you know killed
[31:18] everybody and killed all the Jews and
[31:20] exterminated a bunch of people you know
[31:22] when he conquers he conquers to give
[31:24] life amen he conquers to to to preserve
[31:27] life you he conquers that people would
[31:29] be saved and so Jesus now you know he's
[31:32] a very different kind of conqueror I
[31:34] trust you can just just just be with me
[31:36] tonight amen amen because we do not
[31:39] serve a god of History we we serve the
[31:41] same living one now amen and so there
[31:43] was a decree when Isaiah would stand up
[31:45] and he would say now for unto us a child
[31:48] is born unto us a son is given and the
[31:51] government shall be upon his shoulder
[31:52] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[31:55] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[31:57] father the prin of peace now so he was
[31:59] he was actually declaring that the
[32:02] government or the rulership of this new
[32:04] kingdom was going to rest upon him it
[32:06] wasn't going to rest upon anyone else it
[32:08] was going to rest upon him you say well
[32:10] that's very Elementary but if you think
[32:12] about it now all the all the detail all
[32:16] of the you could say all the burden all
[32:18] of the responsibility lays on his
[32:21] shoulder it doesn't lay on your shoulder
[32:23] it lays on his shoulder am amen cuz many
[32:26] people they you know they get convicted
[32:29] you know they may come to church or read
[32:30] the Bible or hear message they get
[32:32] convicted and then they try and reform
[32:34] themselves and they try and deliver
[32:36] themselves from their own sin they try
[32:38] and Conquer their sin they say well I'm
[32:40] just going to try and live a better life
[32:42] and I'm going to try and think a little
[32:43] bit better today and I'm going to try
[32:45] and treat my family a little bit better
[32:47] today and you know and they're trying to
[32:49] conquer their own selves Lord amen and
[32:51] no man can conquer their own selves amen
[32:54] no man can actually take this flesh into
[32:56] subjection and make himself a new
[32:58] creature no matter how much good
[33:00] intention we may have it doesn't matter
[33:02] how much we would want to really be
[33:05] delivered of our sin it takes him to
[33:07] come and do it it takes him to deliver
[33:09] it's not you that can deliver it's him
[33:11] that delivers amen amen because Isaiah
[33:14] said upon his shoulder amen the
[33:16] government shall be upon his shoulder
[33:18] amen amen so the so the rulership you
[33:20] know the one in charge is going to be
[33:22] all upon his shoulder and this word
[33:25] shoulder it means the place this is this
[33:27] is from the Hebrew it's the place where
[33:30] burdens are carried amen the shoulder is
[33:33] the place where burdens are carried so
[33:35] he is he is actually saying here that
[33:37] it's not just the rulership and the
[33:38] kingship be upon him but all the burdens
[33:41] will be will be carried upon his
[33:43] shoulders you say my pastor is heavy and
[33:46] then what I'm carrying is heavy and I I
[33:48] don't think I can carry it anymore
[33:49] you're not meant to carry it that's
[33:51] right you're not meant to pack it he's
[33:52] meant to pack it amen if you'll let him
[33:56] that's the big qualifier if you'll let
[33:58] him amen you have to be willing to give
[34:00] it up because if you're not willing to
[34:02] give it up he can't carry it that's
[34:04] right that's right and that's why we
[34:06] read in you know Matthew 11 you know he
[34:10] says all that are heavy laden come unto
[34:13] me I want to read it
[34:16] again he says come unto me all ye that
[34:19] labor and are heavy lad and I'll give
[34:21] you rest take my yoke upon you and learn
[34:24] of me for I am meek and lowly in heart
[34:27] and you shall find rest into your souls
[34:29] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[34:32] light so there's he's actually calling
[34:34] now take my yoke and we know the Yol is
[34:36] like an oxen Yol you it ties two
[34:39] together you know you know it's a piece
[34:40] of wood and things and and it actually
[34:43] unites two two Beast of Burden become
[34:45] one and normally if you if you study the
[34:49] how they used to plow there's always be
[34:51] a stronger bulock and a weaker one and
[34:54] they would be yolked together and then
[34:56] so um and it's the same thing with us am
[34:59] mean he's the strong one we're the weak
[35:01] one but he wants to take us down a
[35:03] certain Road amen but the only way you
[35:05] can do it is be yolked to him and it's
[35:08] not being yolked as in good intention up
[35:10] here you going to say it from your heart
[35:11] Lord I want to be yolked to you amen but
[35:13] if you're not willing to give it all you
[35:15] can't receive it all but if you give it
[35:17] all you'll receive it all amen amen it's
[35:20] that it's really that simple you say
[35:21] well but this all remember give it unto
[35:23] him upon his shoulder the burden will be
[35:26] carried amen am upon his shoulder not
[35:29] upon your shoulder not upon your good
[35:32] intentions and how you work things out
[35:33] and this is upon his
[35:35] shoulder because remember if he C if he
[35:39] packs the burden then it's his
[35:41] responsibility amen we have a national
[35:44] disaster the government calls a state of
[35:46] emergency now it's their problem it's
[35:49] not just a little Council and all these
[35:50] little ones trying to organize how to
[35:53] how to you know make best of the
[35:54] situation no the government steps in and
[35:57] and actually falls upon their
[35:59] responsibility and if the disaster
[36:01] relief goes well they get applauded but
[36:03] if it fails they point out who's in
[36:05] charge and the responsibility ultimately
[36:08] ends up on one person right amen times
[36:12] that by a billion Infinities and you
[36:14] understand what I'm saying right amen
[36:16] all the responsibility for life if you
[36:18] give it to him amen amen his shoulders
[36:22] don't get weak his shoulders don't get
[36:24] burdened down am me he doesn't stumble
[36:26] under the Loa amen hallelujah he can do
[36:29] it amen because he's he conquers all
[36:33] things thank you Lord he says this here
[36:36] this is Brother Braham in the pepas
[36:38] vision he says this is going in halfway
[36:40] through a story he says but there was
[36:41] another young man came into the world
[36:44] one time he died at 33 and he conquered
[36:46] everything that could be conquered when
[36:48] he was on Earth he conquered passions he
[36:50] conquered Pride he conquered sickness he
[36:52] conquered Devils when he died he
[36:53] conquered death when he arose he
[36:55] conquered hell he went up and conquered
[36:57] every everything that was against
[36:58] Mankind and and wo the vine The Wine
[37:01] Press of God and crushed it down and
[37:03] conquered death hell grave sickness
[37:05] formalities everything else and overcame
[37:07] it all and Rose on the third day and
[37:09] conquered all the atmospheres above and
[37:11] cut that mist between God and man and
[37:13] connected Heaven and Earth together
[37:14] Glory oh my there he stands the mighty
[37:17] conqueror since he rent The Veil and two
[37:19] there he is has both the keys of death
[37:22] and Hell hanging on his side fear not
[37:24] laid his right hand is power upon him
[37:26] which is John raised him up by the power
[37:28] of His right hand said don't fear I'm he
[37:30] that was and that is and shall come I'm
[37:33] the first and the last I am he that
[37:35] lived and died and is alive again
[37:37] forever man glory to name I mean forever
[37:39] more amen so he conquered everything I'm
[37:42] sure I've established that I'm sure you
[37:43] know that he conquered everything but
[37:45] then you have to be willing for him to
[37:47] conquer you right amen you have to be
[37:50] willing for him to conquer you it's not
[37:52] just Conquering the sickness and the
[37:54] situations in life he's going to
[37:56] ultimately conquer you
[37:58] amen amen you're going to put your hands
[37:59] up and say Lord take this situation I
[38:02] Surrender it to you yes sir amen you
[38:04] have to be willing to do it amen amen
[38:06] that you got to be willing to just lay
[38:08] it all down things come into life you
[38:10] got to say oh God oh my amen you see in
[38:12] the Old Testament when they go to a you
[38:15] real D straight remember it wasn't like
[38:18] you know like Gideon and the amalekites
[38:20] and the know the milites people of the
[38:22] East came in ate up the whole
[38:25] land now the ultimate thing that they
[38:27] had to be delivered from wasn't those
[38:30] people it was the idolatry they found
[38:32] themselves in yes amen they had to be
[38:35] delivered from that God allowed the
[38:37] people to come into the land that they
[38:39] would call upon God they weren't calling
[38:42] upon God when they are bowing themselves
[38:44] down to devil worship right amen but
[38:48] that had to be conquered that was the UL
[38:50] and and notice the first thing when the
[38:52] angel comes to Gideon he says go to your
[38:55] father's house break down the idol amen
[38:59] make make an altar to God and and
[39:02] sacrifice there the first thing conquer
[39:05] this devil amen amen he actually gave
[39:09] him the ability to to defeat the enemy
[39:11] in his home that's right and that was
[39:13] and that and then from that stem the
[39:15] whole victory over the people see the
[39:18] idol worship had to be conquered because
[39:20] idol worship is
[39:21] self-will amen because Rebellion is what
[39:25] is his
[39:26] witchcraft amen so Rebellion what is
[39:29] rebellion I know best right I know what
[39:32] I'm doing I've got it under control God
[39:34] have mercy now some things in life sure
[39:36] we have given God God given abilities to
[39:39] do things but when it comes to walking
[39:42] the way that we should go if you think I
[39:45] know what I'm doing I'm experienced in
[39:47] this sure thing is you're going down a
[39:49] Garden Path someplace right I can
[39:51] guarantee it and you'll find yourself in
[39:54] in some place and you'll say how did I
[39:55] get there that's right
[39:58] and you can't say it was this thing or
[39:59] this thing you say no it's actually I
[40:01] got myself here amen amen so you got to
[40:05] be willing to let him conquer you amen
[40:08] oh God
[40:09] help now in the book of Exodus let's
[40:11] just turn to the Book of Exodus chapter
[40:14] 4 just want to read
[40:19] this may we are talking about Divine
[40:23] leadership amen I'm not interested in
[40:26] religion
[40:27] I'm not interested in saying this is how
[40:29] we should do things because this is how
[40:31] I feel we should do
[40:32] things amen every man is right in his
[40:36] own
[40:36] eyes I don't want to think I'm right in
[40:39] my own eyes Lord examine me amen yes sir
[40:42] put me through your filter whatever
[40:44] under your microscope amen amen to see
[40:47] Lord is there anything is my simple
[40:50] action is there something in my life
[40:51] that's not pleasing to
[40:53] you amen right Exodus chapter
[40:58] 4 now God is God is commissioning Moses
[41:01] in this chapter and this is this is
[41:05] uh let's just read from verse one cuz I
[41:07] like it when he when he cast down the
[41:09] rod as well and Moses answered and said
[41:11] but behold they will not hearken I mean
[41:13] they will not believe me nor hearken
[41:15] unto my voice for they will say the Lord
[41:17] has not appeared unto thee and the Lord
[41:20] said unto him what is that in thine hand
[41:23] and he said a rod and he said cast It On
[41:25] The Ground he cast It to the Ground
[41:27] became a serpent and Moses fled from
[41:29] before it and the Lord said unto Moses
[41:32] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[41:34] tail and he put forth his hand and
[41:36] caught it and it became a rod
[41:40] again that they may believe that the
[41:42] Lord God of their fathers the the god of
[41:44] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[41:46] Jacob has appeared unto thee and the
[41:49] Lord said furthermore put now thine hand
[41:52] into thy bosom and he put his hand into
[41:54] his bosom and when he took it out behold
[41:56] it was his hand was leprous as snow I'm
[42:00] going to talk I'm just going to read
[42:01] this ver and and he said put thy hand
[42:04] into thy bosom again and he put his hand
[42:06] into his bosom again and plucked it out
[42:08] of his bosom and behold it turned again
[42:11] as it was the other flesh now remember
[42:14] Moses Moses was actually God to the
[42:16] people don't you understand that's right
[42:18] God told Moses you'll be God and Aaron
[42:20] will be your Prophet so now what Moses
[42:23] begins to do in his life he's actually
[42:24] displaying God am mean you see you see
[42:28] when when God actually told them this is
[42:30] this is that you know you're down the
[42:32] journey God actually tells Moses I'm
[42:34] sick of these people I'll wipe them off
[42:36] I'll start with you and then Moses stood
[42:39] on the breach he says blot me out of
[42:41] your book don't blot them out remember
[42:43] what you you know the promise you gave
[42:45] to the forefathers and all these
[42:46] different things that was Christ and
[42:48] Moses standing in the
[42:49] breach amen so everything Moses did it
[42:53] was actually God being displayed and
[42:55] then so God was actually showing showing
[42:58] him Moses life now when he took the
[43:00] staff and he put it down it came into a
[43:02] cobra and he picked it up again now the
[43:05] the symbol of the Pharaoh was the Cobra
[43:07] he is the king of the snakes am mean so
[43:10] he was showing through moses' life he
[43:12] was saying I can loose you Satan and I
[43:14] can bind you Satan am mean just as much
[43:16] as I want I can loose you and I can bind
[43:18] you I can loose you and I can bind you
[43:20] and you can't bite me amen amen so he
[43:23] goes into Mo uh you know Pharaoh's court
[43:26] and he says let my people go remember
[43:28] they're God's people not moses' people
[43:29] God speaking first person through a man
[43:31] I trust that doesn't stump you and then
[43:34] so he says let my people go and he says
[43:35] I'll not let them go he says okay to
[43:38] prove that God's with me he throws his
[43:40] rod down turns into a serpent and then
[43:42] Pharaoh he says this is just a cheap
[43:44] trick and he gets his magicians to do
[43:46] the same thing and then Moses snake eats
[43:49] up eats up the magician snakes amen just
[43:52] to prove now that God's power is greater
[43:54] than a mimic and then not only eat them
[43:57] up he he grabs by a tail it turns into a
[43:59] staff again where did where did The
[44:02] Magicians stars go they consumed by
[44:05] God's power and God was actually Moses
[44:08] was demonstrating to Pharaoh I'll loose
[44:10] you and you'll try and loose some power
[44:12] against me my power consume yours I'll
[44:15] pick mine up again as if nothing
[44:17] happened amen I'll bind you Satan I'll
[44:20] loose you Satan amen because remember
[44:23] God was in Moses Satan was in pharaoh
[44:27] and there's a contest going on right
[44:28] there and God was demonstrating I'll
[44:30] loose you I'll bind you I'll do whatever
[44:32] I want with you you have no control over
[44:35] me Let My People Go and God made Pharaoh
[44:41] give eventually he hardened his heart CU
[44:43] he wanted to magnify his power and just
[44:46] remember if you find
[44:48] resistance if you find put yourself in
[44:50] the story if you find
[44:52] resistance amen God's just magnifying
[44:55] his power he want to demonstrate himself
[44:57] S I mean if there's a if if there's
[44:59] something in your soul saying they're
[45:01] mine they must be free amen they must go
[45:05] and and and it's not them resisting
[45:07] remember it's Satan resisting amen I'll
[45:10] not let that person go and you'll say
[45:11] you will I'll make you let them go amen
[45:15] that's what Moses did I'll make you let
[45:16] them go and he just plagued them as much
[45:19] as he wanted to do as his live by God to
[45:21] do it amen so God was demonstrating now
[45:25] I bind you and I loose you and I bind
[45:27] you and I loose you I can do whatever I
[45:28] want with you and then not only that so
[45:31] so he was demonstrating that Moses God
[45:35] was showing through Moses that I have
[45:36] all power over the
[45:38] devil and not only that when he put his
[45:41] hand in his bosom it came out his lepos
[45:43] remember leprosy is a type of sin in the
[45:46] scripture so he's actually demonstrating
[45:48] I'll take that leprosy and I'll take it
[45:50] to myself amen that when you come out
[45:54] again amen that leprosy is gone amen
[45:57] amen I'll take Humanity to myself amen
[46:00] and then when I release you again amen
[46:02] when you're embraced by him Hallelujah
[46:05] all the sin all the unbelief is gone I
[46:07] mean all that unbelief is burned out
[46:10] Hallelujah and and that's what he's
[46:12] demonstrating so God was actually saying
[46:15] now Moses through Moses he saying now
[46:17] it's my
[46:18] responsibility I'm actually imposing a
[46:20] government upon these people and this is
[46:23] what I'm going to enforce in their lives
[46:26] the devil's going to be bound you know
[46:28] loosed and bound he's he's under my
[46:29] dominion and then all the sin of the
[46:31] people's going to be dealt with and then
[46:33] they're going to be restored to what
[46:34] they should have been that's what's
[46:36] being demonstrated there when he took
[46:37] his hand to his bosom and then that was
[46:39] just a prefigure because everything in
[46:41] the Old Testament is just a shadow of
[46:42] the new and then now here comes Jesus
[46:45] because remember there's a prophecy from
[46:48] from the from the Garden of Eden the
[46:49] first words that God speaks to the devil
[46:52] he says the seed of the woman is going
[46:54] to crush your head that's the first
[46:56] promise he of Satan this is what's going
[46:58] to happen and then whenever that serpent
[47:00] Bruiser looks like he's going to arrive
[47:02] that you know that's when Satan tries to
[47:04] kill all the young babies that's why he
[47:06] tried to kill the males there in Egypt
[47:08] cuz he knew that that serpent Bruiser he
[47:10] knew there was going to be a Deliverance
[47:11] happening we must stop this Deliverance
[47:13] he said but God said you will not stop
[47:15] my Deliverance amen amen so then Moses
[47:17] was kept and all those things happened
[47:19] and then the same thing happened when
[47:21] Jesus was born and Herod tried to kill
[47:23] the two-year-olds and down because he
[47:25] knew he was worried oh where is he born
[47:28] King of the Jews what king Hallelujah
[47:31] and then so he said you know and then
[47:33] and then so that will happen because the
[47:35] serpent the serpent Bruiser was coming
[47:37] amen Christ himself that not Not only
[47:39] would take dominion over all the Devils
[47:42] upon the Earth but then he had conquer
[47:44] the head devil amen and when the head
[47:46] Devils conquered all the other ones blow
[47:48] and fall amen you see that in you know
[47:51] in that service there all the meetings
[47:53] in you know in Oregon you know brother B
[47:56] he talking about faith that big man
[47:58] comes that devil possessed man comes
[48:00] onto the platform I'll tear you liom
[48:02] from Li standing a big massive guy spits
[48:05] in his face and all these different
[48:06] things and brother bram's a train box
[48:08] remember when he was young he so so he
[48:10] could have tried to take him on but he
[48:11] knew this wasn't a flesh and blood of
[48:13] fear and this guy had had gone to other
[48:16] meetings and punched out preachers
[48:18] before amen and then so now he says no
[48:22] because you've challenged the servant
[48:23] Living God you'll fall at my feet is
[48:25] dead that's exactly what happened and
[48:27] the police come and say well is he dead
[48:29] no he's not dead but can you get him off
[48:31] my feet and then he said as I saying
[48:33] faith is the substance of things hope
[48:34] for and then people begin to get healed
[48:37] and people just getting delivered and
[48:38] everyone just got healed in the meeting
[48:40] why cuz the head devil had just been
[48:41] defeated amen hallelujah and we must
[48:44] recognize the head Devil's defeated amen
[48:46] tonight Satan himself he has he doesn't
[48:48] have the keys to his own house amen he
[48:51] doesn't even have control the Church of
[48:53] the Living God can bind him and can
[48:55] loose him right hallah can bind them and
[48:58] can loose them and not only that they
[49:00] can take people and lift them into the
[49:01] presence of God that there's leprosy is
[49:05] undone cuz he's the mighty
[49:08] conqueror that is not wives tales it's
[49:11] reality when Peter yet spake these words
[49:14] the Holy Ghost fell upon the people and
[49:16] their unbelief and all their things were
[49:18] cleansed out of them because the Holy
[49:19] Ghost fell upon them Acts chapter
[49:21] 10 amen so our God is still alive amen
[49:26] but now
[49:28] let's go to Hebrews 2 I'll read another
[49:32] scripture he says this here Hebrews
[49:38] 2:9 but we see Jesus who has made a
[49:40] little lower than the angels for the
[49:42] suffering of death remember he's going
[49:44] to he's going to take something upon his
[49:45] shoulder here he comes he's going to he
[49:49] says for this cause I've come into the
[49:50] world and that cause was to take sin
[49:53] upon himself I mean here's our lamb
[49:55] remember the sacrif
[49:57] the sin offering took the sin of the
[49:58] person upon them amen that the sin was
[50:01] transferred from the person to them amen
[50:04] because the Judgment wasn't cast upon
[50:06] the worshipper the Judgment was cast
[50:08] upon the lamb and that's why the lamb
[50:09] died because that sin was now attributed
[50:12] not to the worshiper but to the lamb
[50:14] amen so now he's going to he's going to
[50:16] take he's going to take something upon
[50:18] his shoulder because the government's
[50:19] upon his shoulder and we're going to see
[50:22] how he's going to deal with this but we
[50:23] see Jesus who is made a little lower
[50:25] than the angels for the suffering of
[50:27] death crowned with Glory and Honor that
[50:29] he by the grace of God should taste
[50:31] death for every man for it became him
[50:33] for whom are all things and by whom all
[50:36] are all things in the beig and bringing
[50:39] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[50:42] of their salvation perfect through
[50:43] sufferings for both he that s pardon me
[50:47] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[50:49] who are Sanctified are all of one for
[50:52] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[50:54] them Brethren saying I will declare thy
[50:57] name uh thy name unto my brethren in the
[51:00] midst of the church will I sing praise
[51:02] unto thee and again I will put my trust
[51:04] in him and again behold I and the
[51:07] children which God hath given me for as
[51:09] much then as the children are partakers
[51:11] of Flesh and Blood he all he also
[51:14] himself likewise took part of the same
[51:17] that through death he might destroy him
[51:20] that had the power of death that is that
[51:23] is the devil and deliver them who
[51:25] through fear of death all this lifetime
[51:28] subject to bondage for verely he took
[51:30] not on him the nature of angels but he
[51:33] took on him the Seed of Abraham
[51:35] wherefore in all things that behooved
[51:37] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[51:40] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[51:42] high priest and the things pertaining to
[51:44] God to make reconciliation for the sins
[51:47] of the people for in that himself have
[51:51] suffered being tempted he is he is able
[51:55] to to secure them that are tempted and
[51:58] that word actually means to help to Aid
[52:00] to
[52:01] relief there he comes now he says come
[52:05] unto
[52:06] me come unto me ye that are heavy laden
[52:09] come unto me remember Jesus Christ the
[52:12] same yesterday today and forever we're
[52:14] not talking about a God in history or
[52:16] back on Galilee saying come on you know
[52:18] that same voice is speaking out tonight
[52:21] he says come unto me all ye that are
[52:22] labor and heavy laden and I'll give you
[52:25] rest you got to take my yoke upon you
[52:29] take take my yoke upon you for it is
[52:32] light am mean so it has to be an
[52:35] exchange where you have to be willing
[52:37] what uh you know not only just to
[52:39] because some people they just want him
[52:41] as Savior but not Lord but you can't
[52:43] have both you you can't have them
[52:45] separate they have to be both if you
[52:47] want him to be savior then he has to be
[52:49] your lord he has to be your ruler he has
[52:51] to be your king because if I don't
[52:53] acknowledge the government you know what
[52:56] why am I not an American citizen I don't
[52:59] have the citizenship papers I don't
[53:01] recognize their government I'm not part
[53:03] of their Kingdom or their country amen
[53:07] but because I was born in New Zealand
[53:09] and by birth I'm a
[53:11] citizen then then he is then then then
[53:14] the Beehive whoever's there prime
[53:16] minister he is my
[53:19] ruler because of where I'm born amen
[53:22] it's the same thing being a Christian
[53:24] because I've been birthed by the spirit
[53:27] of God that are because by one Spirit
[53:29] we're all baptized into one body or to
[53:31] one Kingdom I could say so because of
[53:34] been birth into that Kingdom he is my
[53:36] king amen and his he is my government
[53:40] you understand but the only way that can
[53:42] ever happen is you not only recognize
[53:44] him as Savior but also Lord because a
[53:47] lot of people they want God to help them
[53:49] with things but they don't actually want
[53:51] they're not willing so they want him to
[53:53] conquer th those situations Lord conquer
[53:56] of these problems but ultimately as I
[53:58] said about getting your you read
[54:01] judges they get delivered they fall into
[54:04] idol worship and they get delivered they
[54:06] you know and there's a cycle that keeps
[54:08] going down and the first thing that's
[54:10] normally causes them to be free is that
[54:12] God deals with the idol actually
[54:14] conquers them right God uses a man to
[54:17] conquer the people and then the people
[54:19] conquer the
[54:20] enemy amen so God you have to be willing
[54:25] now not just for him to deal with your
[54:28] problems conquer your problems he has to
[54:30] conquer you amen amen that's right and
[54:34] if you're willing if you're willing to
[54:35] let them conquer you then everything
[54:37] else will whatever happens with that
[54:40] that's
[54:41] irrelevant amen if you're willing to let
[54:43] them conquer you amen because if you let
[54:47] him conquer you just like if we invaded
[54:49] Australia The Beehive would be in charge
[54:51] of Australia our government would extend
[54:54] over them if we conquer them y amen it's
[54:57] the same thing if you're willing to
[54:59] surrender to him then his government
[55:02] will come upon you amen amen amen and
[55:06] this is not just a mental thing if
[55:08] you're willing to really surrender
[55:10] everything then his government the
[55:12] government shall be upon his shoulder so
[55:14] if you lay yourself at his feet then you
[55:17] are his responsibility amen amen but if
[55:21] you're not willing to do that then you
[55:24] are not his responsibility it's very
[55:27] simple amen so he took the sin of the
[55:31] world upon his
[55:32] shoulder amen but then he didn't you
[55:36] know but then when he arose he didn't
[55:38] carry that sin burden anymore amen amen
[55:41] and then when you arise when you arise
[55:45] I'm not pulling it strings when you lay
[55:47] your burden down remember take your you
[55:50] it's an exchange we're born with this
[55:52] weight of sin Upon Our shoulders and
[55:55] it's not by the we've done we are born
[55:58] in sin sh iniquity come to this world
[56:00] speaking Lies We have this debt on us so
[56:03] we cannot pay so it's not because I lie
[56:06] cheat or steal that's irrelevant that's
[56:08] only things to make you recognize you're
[56:09] a sinner oh I've got a temper I do or
[56:12] whatever that just makes you recognize
[56:14] you're a sinner but you actually got
[56:16] this debt that you were birthed with
[56:18] amen amen you were birth with a debt
[56:21] right and then so the only way to get
[56:23] rid of that debt is not to try and
[56:24] reform yourself because brother Braham
[56:27] says really simply it's like a pig you
[56:28] can take a pig out of the mud and then
[56:31] you can clean up the pig and you can put
[56:32] a lamb coat on the pig but it's because
[56:35] that pig Nature's in the pig he'll run
[56:37] to the m amen it's like a man who's in
[56:40] great debt and then a very successful
[56:43] business comes along and says I'll pay
[56:45] you out of debt you know no you know no
[56:48] strings attached I'll pay you debt off
[56:50] now that is wonderful but if the nature
[56:53] in the man doesn't change he can fall
[56:55] into dead again
[56:56] but if the nature that's in the wealthy
[56:58] man goes into that man he won't go to
[57:00] dead anymore amen so we can just be
[57:04] justified and our debt is wiped off but
[57:07] if we're only just Justified we can
[57:10] still go back into that rut again amen
[57:13] it takes the life of God to come into US
[57:16] amen amen that we won't go back into
[57:18] those things
[57:19] anymore so it's an
[57:22] exchange I don't know really how to wind
[57:25] this up but I trust it things down deep
[57:27] you have to be willing he says take my
[57:29] yoke upon you well if I'm carrying
[57:32] something I got to get rid of that to
[57:35] pick on something else amen amen so you
[57:38] can't have you can't have his yoke and
[57:41] you can't have your yoke you have to
[57:44] exchange your yoke for his it doesn't
[57:46] matter if it's a yoke of bitterness or
[57:50] you know depression or feeling sorry for
[57:52] myself or whatever it is whatever the
[57:55] Yoke may be
[57:56] and you may feel justified in your
[57:58] position against people whatever but the
[58:01] scripture tells us do not let any root
[58:03] of busness come within thee because by
[58:06] which many are
[58:08] defiled amen well they did wrong to me
[58:12] irrelevant because at the end of sure
[58:15] they may have you you may be justified
[58:17] to feel a certain way against people but
[58:20] if you hold on to that you can't take
[58:23] his yoke amen you can't take his burden
[58:27] you can't let his government go upon
[58:29] your shoulder you can't do
[58:32] it
[58:35] amen
[58:37] friends don't carry your own burden amen
[58:40] amen amen don't carry don't carry things
[58:45] we're not made to carry things a sheep
[58:47] is not a beast of burden amen I don't
[58:49] know if you've ever studied sheep
[58:50] they're not a beast of burden a muers a
[58:53] camel or whatever but a sheep is not a
[58:55] beast of burden
[58:56] and we're made like
[58:58] Sheep amen if you put a burden on the
[59:02] sheep it'll eventually break its leg or
[59:04] do something and it won't be able to
[59:06] move
[59:07] anymore amen that's why you got to let
[59:09] the great Shepherd come amen amen not in
[59:12] just in good intentions but you got to
[59:14] be willing your whole identity you got
[59:16] to be willing to lay yourself die to
[59:18] yourself whatever you think you are it
[59:21] must die amen
[59:24] amen oh I'm a message beli ver that must
[59:27] die I know the doctrine it must die I'm
[59:30] a Christian that must die amen I'm
[59:34] self-righteous that must
[59:36] die amen amen that all must die I'm a
[59:40] good Christian I've been raised in
[59:41] church that must die amen I believe in
[59:45] Jesus only that must die CU that's just
[59:48] religion without knowing
[59:50] him the Rich Young Ruler kept all the
[59:53] Commandments from his youth he was a
[59:56] model Christian I'll put it this way he
[59:58] was a model Christian but he did not
[1:00:00] have eternal life and he wasn't willing
[1:00:03] to take his yoke upon him and then take
[1:00:07] Jesus's yoke upon
[1:00:08] himself amen because Here Comes Divine
[1:00:11] leadership becomes before Jesus he says
[1:00:13] what must I do to inherit eternal life
[1:00:17] he says s all you have give to the poor
[1:00:19] take up your cross and follow me Here
[1:00:21] Comes The Godly instruction now this is
[1:00:22] what you need to do and the Rich Young
[1:00:24] Ruler knew he didn't have what he needed
[1:00:26] otherwise he would never have come to
[1:00:29] Jesus and so here was now this is all he
[1:00:32] had to do yes Lord sell it all take up
[1:00:35] his cross and follow her that's all he
[1:00:36] had to do he could have gone because he
[1:00:39] would have had you know being being
[1:00:41] someone Rich you normally have people to
[1:00:42] help you out and you know your
[1:00:43] accountants and so on he could have
[1:00:45] called up his accountant sell everything
[1:00:48] give it to these people done
[1:00:50] Lord amen I got to bring it to you know
[1:00:53] bring it today's language that's all he
[1:00:55] had to do send an email hold on I'll
[1:00:57] just WhatsApp my accountant sell it all
[1:01:00] it's
[1:01:01] done but he wasn't
[1:01:04] willing he wasn't willing to do it
[1:01:07] because he justified
[1:01:09] himself but I keep the law he was sad
[1:01:13] when he went away said he went away sad
[1:01:15] but he justified
[1:01:17] himself because if he didn't justify
[1:01:19] himself he would never have walked away
[1:01:24] sad what what he justified himself in I
[1:01:28] can use this money to help people if I
[1:01:30] get more money I can help more people I
[1:01:32] can help the synagogue I can help repair
[1:01:34] the temple I can do good Christian
[1:01:37] things I believe in Jehovah
[1:01:40] too amen it wasn't
[1:01:43] enough for what he
[1:01:46] needed amen and the government shall be
[1:01:49] upon his
[1:01:51] shoulder I'm just going to close it
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:54] there but you have to be
[1:01:56] willing amen if you're not willing he
[1:02:00] can't help you
[1:02:02] amen amen let's bow our head shall
[1:02:08] we gracious
[1:02:11] Lord father such
[1:02:14] a lord it's a simple thing but yet it's
[1:02:19] not a simple thing father we haven't
[1:02:21] come to have our ears
[1:02:23] tickled but father we've come for a
[1:02:25] close to walk with you amen Lord Jesus
[1:02:28] dear Lord and I was so touched when I
[1:02:29] thought of
[1:02:30] this father and Lord how the
[1:02:33] government's upon your
[1:02:35] shoulder Lord you're in
[1:02:38] charge we are your
[1:02:41] responsibility father we can't help
[1:02:43] ourselves we can't deliver ourselves
[1:02:46] Lord we can't cause ourselves
[1:02:49] to uh be better Christians in our own
[1:02:52] strength
[1:02:53] alone but father it takes you ultimately
[1:02:56] yes Lord father it takes you to come and
[1:02:58] consume the sacrifice it takes you to
[1:03:00] put your life in it takes you to Deliver
[1:03:03] us from sin it takes you to Deliver Us
[1:03:05] from bondage dear Lord Jesus it takes
[1:03:08] you father to do these things Lord no
[1:03:11] man can do it in their own strength
[1:03:13] father because people have tried
[1:03:16] Generations have tried father to to to
[1:03:19] be Christians in their own strength and
[1:03:21] they've miserably failed Lord we saw
[1:03:23] Israel Lord we see it in the Old
[1:03:25] Testament they miserably failed because
[1:03:28] they wanted to do it their way they
[1:03:29] wanted to keep a law father your Prophet
[1:03:31] said that how Grace brought them out of
[1:03:33] Egypt Grace gave them gave them a profit
[1:03:36] Grace gave them the way to sacrifice but
[1:03:39] they wanted something to do and they
[1:03:41] failed and Lord we don't want to fail
[1:03:44] Lord just because we're the side of the
[1:03:45] Cross doesn't mean we can't fail so
[1:03:48] father I pray You' take us now dear Lord
[1:03:52] father is anyone here who hasn't
[1:03:54] surrendered totally to you really really
[1:03:56] surrendered to you not just out of good
[1:03:58] Ambitions but it's really just giving it
[1:04:00] over to you father if they're holding
[1:04:02] anything in Lord may they just confess
[1:04:04] it to you right now father may they lay
[1:04:07] it at your feet Lord father may they
[1:04:10] give it to you oh god father may they
[1:04:11] not hold on to it Lord Jesus father I
[1:04:14] just pray oh God you just have your way
[1:04:16] in this service now Lord father help us
[1:04:19] Lord I pray be with each one dear God
[1:04:22] our government Lord Lord the
[1:04:24] government's upon your shoulder
[1:04:26] father may we not try and live The
[1:04:27] Message In Our Own Strength Lord may we
[1:04:30] not try and be Christians in our own
[1:04:31] strength Lord may we not hide behind
[1:04:33] quotes and Bible verses Lord no doubt
[1:04:36] the Rich Young Ruler tried to hide
[1:04:38] behind Bible verses and quotes of Moses
[1:04:40] but he couldn't do it Lord
[1:04:42] ultimately Lord as he said when he was
[1:04:45] old he had Barns and everything he said
[1:04:46] now my soul can rest and that night he
[1:04:49] said to him you full your souls required
[1:04:51] of you when you went to hell father we
[1:04:53] don't want to end up in that predicament
[1:04:55] Lord he was looking for rest for his
[1:04:56] soul and he came to the Fountain but he
[1:04:59] wasn't willing to to surrender to the
[1:05:01] Fountain father May that not be our
[1:05:03] portion Lord I believe it's not by your
[1:05:05] grace thank you Lord dear Lord I commit
[1:05:07] each one into your hands father mold us
[1:05:10] over again would you Lord thank you Lord
[1:05:12] Lord we lord we want to every burden we
[1:05:15] carry Lord even it's not a sin burden if
[1:05:18] we've given to that that to you years
[1:05:19] ago Lord but if we have things we hold
[1:05:22] on to against people and you know
[1:05:24] questions and and and problems in life
[1:05:26] and things that we hold on to Lord may
[1:05:28] we not hold on to them Lord but may we
[1:05:30] just give them to you oh God please may
[1:05:33] you grant it Lord you break every feder
