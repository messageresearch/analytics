[16:34] um apologies for that we we were told
[16:37] there was 8 30 but brother Isaac which
[16:39] is our master of cinnamonies uh had had
[16:42] the impression it was nine o'clock but
[16:44] it all works and this is exactly how um
[16:47] how the Lord wants it to work so um he's
[16:50] in control he's about five minutes away
[16:52] what we um suggest is I will open an in
[16:56] a word of prayer and then in your own
[17:00] start praying start meditating on um
[17:04] the gratefulness in your heart for
[17:06] another year that the laws LED you and

[26:29] year I promise
[26:33] you just got there brother adamant
[26:39] praise the lord it's um
[26:45] you always get a lot of mileage out of
[26:47] that joke for the when you get to the
[26:48] end of the year
[26:53] this is a very casual um event so
[26:57] it's not um
[26:59] not very really really formal
[27:02] so you can all just relax
[27:06] um
[27:07] yeah it's just um
[27:11] for yourself feel free it's not going to
[27:12] be all um I just dressed in my normal
[27:15] clothes too so
[27:16] but yeah it's good we're just going to
[27:18] have a good time and um
[27:22] just enjoy you know it's a time of
[27:24] reflection at the end of the year we can
[27:26] look back and
[27:28] um
[27:30] see where the Lord's taking us
[27:32] and I think I saw all of you here last
[27:34] year most of you
[27:35] so you're all better you're all you've
[27:37] all moved on and the Lord you're you're
[27:39] richer in Christ in some way I can
[27:42] guarantee it you're wealthier now than
[27:44] what you were last year more spiritually
[27:46] wealthier now and
[27:48] you know and it's the time we can just
[27:50] stop and
[27:51] look back on the year that has been
[27:53] and then also look forward to the year
[27:55] that that will be
[27:57] for some reason there seems to be a lot
[27:58] of
[27:59] um
[28:02] like pessimism about the last few years
[28:04] like oh I'm glad this year's over sort
[28:06] of thing I'm like man what are you
[28:08] talking about this is like being the
[28:09] best year of my life ever and next year
[28:11] is going to be even better you know I
[28:12] haven't found anything hard as a as a
[28:15] Christian we just every year is good you
[28:17] know it doesn't matter
[28:19] whether we have
[28:20] this covert this lockdown that that
[28:22] doesn't matter God's in control of it
[28:24] all and and through every situation
[28:28] we we are just walking with the Lord we
[28:31] are we're like a tree planted by the
[28:33] rivers of water and if there's a drought
[28:35] we don't feel it you know we just carry
[28:37] on we just go on and so I've had a
[28:40] fantastic year I don't know about you if
[28:41] you guys all had a good year
[28:43] it's it's been a fantastic year it's
[28:46] been the best year yet
[28:48] you know and and next year is going to
[28:49] be even better we're going to have a
[28:51] great year next year it's it's
[28:53] it doesn't matter what the world
[28:55] situation is or what the economic
[28:56] situation is or the medical situation is
[28:59] or anything like that
[29:01] because God has got such a great program
[29:03] for us next year
[29:05] it has he's got so many great things in
[29:07] store for us like that the windows of
[29:09] Heaven are opening up and pouring out
[29:11] upon us
[29:12] this is this is the season for
[29:14] for the the richness of God to come into
[29:16] each one of our lives and and the most
[29:18] powerful way that it ever has before
[29:20] that's that's where we're at that's
[29:21] that's the program that's what we've got
[29:22] looking to look forward to so we are the
[29:25] happiest people on the face of the Earth
[29:27] and we're content you know and
[29:29] and
[29:30] um
[29:31] yeah I'm just so glad to be a Christian
[29:32] I'm so glad that we can have hope
[29:34] imagine living a life with no hope
[29:37] they're hopeless
[29:40] you know you can apparently you can live
[29:41] without love you can live without a lot
[29:42] of things but you can't live without
[29:44] hope as soon as people lose hope they
[29:46] they die that's it
[29:48] like if they're under a heart at a under
[29:51] extreme hardship
[29:52] if they lose hope they die it's a it's
[29:55] actually proven you know you can live
[29:57] without love you can live without lots
[29:58] of things but you live without hope
[29:59] you're done but I'm glad that we have a
[30:01] blessed hope you know we we're always so
[30:04] positive because we know that all the
[30:06] scriptures we read in the Bible
[30:08] always
[30:10] when when Believers through all the ages
[30:13] trust in God God always delivers there's
[30:15] never a time where they do all the right
[30:18] things they trust in God and then it
[30:19] says and God didn't deliver him and then
[30:21] he just went off and failed and that was
[30:22] the end of that story and here's the
[30:24] next one you can't name me a scripture
[30:26] where that happened it's it's all
[30:28] positive like the promises of God are
[30:31] Yan amen so as a result we can look back
[30:33] and think look at our situation whenever
[30:35] we're going through and think well
[30:36] that's the same thing's going to happen
[30:37] to me if I approach God the same way
[30:39] that all these other people did and I
[30:41] approach the promises the same way then
[30:42] I'll receive the same thing that's the
[30:44] way that it's going to work you know we
[30:45] can have we can have so much hope so
[30:48] let's that's who we are so welcome to
[30:51] this um service tonight
[30:53] brother Ben did tell me it started at
[30:55] nine o'clock by the way
[30:58] he was like I'll get there at 8 30 and
[31:00] then people will just slowly turn up and
[31:01] then about nine o'clock make a start
[31:03] um but what we're going to do we've got
[31:06] um we're just gonna like I did want to
[31:09] like make it a bit more informal and
[31:10] push all the chairs out and
[31:12] stuff but apparently they were they were
[31:14] hard to move
[31:17] are they
[31:20] but we're strong bro look at these boys
[31:22] at the front here man they could love to
[31:24] cheer each
[31:35] look the night is young we've got the
[31:37] whole night ahead of us what we do now
[31:39] is the way it's going to stay for the
[31:40] rest of the night
[31:41] so if we want to sit like this we can if
[31:44] we want to move them around we can it's
[31:46] like
[31:47] we actually are we're sort of doing this
[31:50] here so
[31:51] it's up to us if we enjoy it like this
[31:53] we can do it like this if we want to
[31:54] move them around a bit we can it's up to
[31:57] us so we we don't have like a we don't
[31:59] have to
[32:02] talk to the um
[32:04] the head on how to say this like you
[32:07] know the denominations they have to sort
[32:08] of you know you've got to send you you
[32:10] gotta you gotta well if it's not in the
[32:13] program you can't do it you know
[32:14] um how do you feel you guys all do you
[32:16] feel all right like something like that
[32:17] or you feel are you all right yeah okay
[32:19] you're not going to be too like I don't
[32:21] want you all like
[32:22] you know
[32:25] hey
[32:29] yeah kind of
[32:32] I I like informal because it gets people
[32:34] just a bit more relaxed you know like
[32:36] when we sit like this we because we get
[32:38] conditioned like and I'm I'm like that
[32:39] in the church when I when I arrive in
[32:41] church and sit down I don't talk I'm not
[32:43] doing nothing I'm quiet apart from amen
[32:45] I won't like if someone talks about I'll
[32:47] talk quietly and that's just that's
[32:48] that's etiquette in a church you know
[32:50] because you don't want to disrupt other
[32:51] people's worship but man I find when we
[32:53] do this here like I find a hard to snap
[32:56] out of that mentality
[32:58] okay let's move the chairs
[33:13] and we're all going to be tied at 12 30
[33:15] and move them all back
[33:17] [Laughter]
[33:22] uh let's make a circle like a yeah just
[33:24] just so there's enough room for everyone
[33:26] to sit in
[33:27] yeah
[33:29] the old timers will know how to do it
[33:31] all the old timers
[33:32] show them how it's done
[33:46] uh one one if possible and then we can
[33:49] have a few at the back of people who got
[33:50] children they can go at the back
[34:02] uh maybe leave that one not there
[34:04] because I'm

[36:58] shake hands with one another if you
[37:01] haven't if you haven't met each other

[38:04] just all relaxed that's what we're going
[38:07] to be tonight

[1:53:22] that the Lord is good
[1:53:24] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:53:35] Deuteronomy 30 16. and that I command
[1:53:38] thee this day to love the Lord thy God
[1:53:40] in to walk in his ways and to keep his
[1:53:42] Commandments and his statutes and his
[1:53:44] judgments that thou mayest live and
[1:53:47] multiply
[1:53:48] and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in
[1:53:50] the land whether thou goest to possess
[1:53:52] it
[1:53:56] I was kind of thinking that with a lot
[1:53:57] of these promises it's like do this and
[1:54:01] then I'll bless you like I was kind of
[1:54:04] thinking that it does require bravery
[1:54:06] you know like to trust the Lord and
[1:54:08] actually go Lord I commit this to you I
[1:54:10] Surrender it to you it's like brave
[1:54:11] people
[1:54:12] get all the blessings of God because
[1:54:14] they give everything you know and I was
[1:54:16] just thinking about a song that blessed
[1:54:18] me this year a lot
[1:54:19] um and sister Belinda sent it through to
[1:54:21] me and it was called um
[1:54:24] be it unto me according to Thy word and
[1:54:27] I was thinking
[1:54:29] yeah like that's like a full surrender
[1:54:31] just be it unto me Lord like Mary said
[1:54:33] according to Thy word you know like
[1:54:35] Marius gave everything and then
[1:54:38] you know because it's a lot of sacrifice
[1:54:40] that she did but she her life was
[1:54:42] blessed and
[1:54:43] then we have what we have because of how
[1:54:45] the Lord sacrificed you know so it's
[1:54:47] like yeah
[1:54:49] if he gave it sometimes we can feel
[1:54:51] um
[1:54:52] like we don't necessarily deserve it
[1:54:54] quite undeserving of all these promises
[1:54:56] and blessings but it's so awesome that
[1:54:59] it's not conditional it's just a gift to
[1:55:01] us so sometimes when we don't know even
[1:55:02] how to we're going to say be it unto me
[1:55:04] according to that word
[1:55:06] and um
[1:55:08] maybe is there one more black mic
[1:55:11] can you give it to my friend over there
[1:55:13] please
[1:55:16] there's one right opposite that I'm
[1:55:18] looking at thank you I just think yeah
[1:55:20] which one aren't we so blessed we have
[1:55:22] so many friends straight away it's like
[1:55:24] it it could give it to anybody
[1:55:28] um sister but Lindy remind me
[1:55:31] um so we want to I know brother Anis
[1:55:33] loves learning new songs brother Anis

[1:55:40] know it's a it's a Maori so I need
[1:55:42] sister Belinda to help me
[1:55:45] what key shall we start in it's just be
[1:55:47] done to me but we're going to sing the
[1:55:49] Maori version

[1:57:54] foreign

[1:58:10] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:58:13] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:58:15] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[1:58:18] Waters
[1:58:21] okay I'll only share a small Testament
[1:58:22] I'll try and keep it small
[1:58:24] and like Isaac says this is the best
[1:58:27] year ever
[1:58:29] it's been a wonderful year of blessings
[1:58:31] amazing amazing blessings because God
[1:58:34] has been there
[1:58:38] so um I wanted to just say this because
[1:58:41] the girls sang that song
[1:58:44] um
[1:58:45] when
[1:58:48] um Dimitri had just started his
[1:58:51] I think
[1:58:53] I can't remember if he'd started the
[1:58:55] chemotherapy or he already had one round
[1:58:58] we
[1:59:00] he was we were at the Ronald McDonald
[1:59:02] House Down in Christchurch
[1:59:04] and so we had that we got one room to
[1:59:06] share
[1:59:07] and he was in the bed next to me and I
[1:59:08] woke up at one in the morning and
[1:59:12] for the first time it began to overwhelm
[1:59:14] me because God had promised right from
[1:59:16] the beginning he'd given me all these
[1:59:18] scriptures all these promises so I'd
[1:59:19] never been worried but um at one o'clock
[1:59:22] in the morning we can all get a little
[1:59:25] overwhelmed
[1:59:26] um
[1:59:27] and he just gave me one line from that
[1:59:31] song but it was niggling at me so I had
[1:59:33] to look it up on my phone
[1:59:34] and I had to play it with earphones in
[1:59:38] because Dimitri was asleep I'm wearing a
[1:59:41] house with a lot of other people
[1:59:42] but it was just such an amazing blessing
[1:59:45] that song during every time that
[1:59:50] anything becomes a little too much
[1:59:53] he just gives you something to be so
[1:59:55] joyful and praiseful about
[1:59:58] so that one o'clock in the morning I'm
[1:59:59] lying in bed
[2:00:02] screaming singing with all my strength
[2:00:05] silently because people are asleep
[2:00:09] with this with this song going on and it
[2:00:11] was the most amazing blessing now every
[2:00:12] time I hear that song I just remember
[2:00:14] that that moment where he was there
[2:00:17] Hallelujah
[2:00:18] [Applause]
[2:00:28] please send that which persecute you
[2:00:31] bless and curse not
[2:00:41] it has truly been such a blessed year
[2:00:43] and I can't
[2:00:44] um
[2:00:45] pass up an opportunity to say the Lord
[2:00:47] has been so good to me
[2:00:49] um I've actually been saying it a few
[2:00:50] times today he's been so good to me
[2:00:53] um the just keep thinking that's for me
[2:00:55] the song is Lord Lord surely you've been
[2:00:57] good to me
[2:00:58] and it's truly it's I've never felt it
[2:01:01] so much as this year he's
[2:01:03] my life is completely his and nothing
[2:01:06] can harm me nothing can touch me unless
[2:01:08] it's his perfect will and then it's the
[2:01:10] best thing ever for me it's such a
[2:01:12] wonderful Revelation to have
[2:01:15] just to know he's in control
[2:01:17] one scripture that's been very
[2:01:20] um much blessing to me is the one that's
[2:01:21] just the genie just read the Lord is my
[2:01:23] shepherd
[2:01:25] um
[2:01:26] since for a couple of months it's been
[2:01:28] my scripture so
[2:01:30] I don't think I could have even read it
[2:01:32] so thank you
[2:01:34] they're just so thankful that
[2:01:37] I'm just as sheep I don't have to figure
[2:01:39] anything out he he's my shepherd
[2:01:42] and he will take me all the way he's got
[2:01:44] his eye on me and I know he's it's all
[2:01:46] his ability and I'm so thankful God
[2:01:49] bless you
[2:01:57] um he that handled mathemata wisely
[2:02:00] she'll find good and who's so trusted in
[2:02:03] the Lord happy as he Proverbs 16 20.
[2:02:08] I was sitting here thinking I wonder
[2:02:11] which one I would get
[2:02:16] and that really makes me happy because
[2:02:18] um that couldn't be more perfect
[2:02:21] um I just have a thankful heart
[2:02:25] um yes this year has indeed be a really
[2:02:28] really blessed year
[2:02:30] um it's been a hard year it's been lots
[2:02:34] of Trials but
[2:02:36] one thing that I can say is that
[2:02:42] the Lord has definitely helped me handle
[2:02:44] a lot of matters very wisely
[2:02:48] um he's given me the ability and
[2:02:53] um
[2:02:56] to be able to trust in him completely
[2:02:59] even when I couldn't see anything I
[2:03:02] couldn't see
[2:03:03] um through the trials and the trials
[2:03:05] came thick and fast and hard and
[2:03:11] the more I trusted in the Lord
[2:03:13] the harder the trials came
[2:03:17] but then he just proved to me that all I
[2:03:20] needed to do was just trust in him
[2:03:21] completely
[2:03:23] um
[2:03:24] one thing I can say with an absolute
[2:03:27] thankful heart is
[2:03:30] um
[2:03:30] through it all he's never ever felt me
[2:03:35] yet
[2:03:36] and it didn't matter
[2:03:39] what the victory was that it didn't
[2:03:40] matter how big and I and and
[2:03:44] I have had some huge victories and I've
[2:03:47] had some little victories but they were
[2:03:50] victories anyway and through it all he
[2:03:54] never failed me
[2:03:55] and it's because I've trusted in him
[2:03:57] completely it didn't come easy trusting
[2:04:01] the Lord is not easy because
[2:04:03] a lot of the times I wanted my own will
[2:04:05] and I I wanted certain things
[2:04:09] um
[2:04:10] but
[2:04:12] the trust came in ways that I didn't
[2:04:15] expect in the outcome
[2:04:17] but
[2:04:20] I came through the trials and um
[2:04:25] I can't believe that it's the end of the
[2:04:27] year I said to Matt I can't believe that
[2:04:28] we on the last day of this year and it
[2:04:31] almost feels to me like
[2:04:33] we were sitting here a year ago already
[2:04:35] and it's a year later and I can't even
[2:04:39] feel like it's another whole year that's
[2:04:41] gone by
[2:04:43] um and it doesn't feel like a whole year
[2:04:46] to me but
[2:04:48] um I just want to thank the Lord
[2:04:51] um I don't think I mean I could sit here
[2:04:53] all night
[2:04:54] saying thank you to the Lord because I'm
[2:04:57] so thankful for everything that the Lord
[2:04:58] has done for me and my family this year
[2:05:03] um but um
[2:05:06] yeah
[2:05:07] not only not only for myself but also to
[2:05:10] every single one of you that's here
[2:05:12] tonight as well
[2:05:14] um whenever we've asked for prayer and
[2:05:17] through everything

[2:05:23] and Marlon family and for prayers and
[2:05:27] lifting us up before the Lord and um
[2:05:31] and most importantly thank you to the
[2:05:32] Lord for everything that he's done for
[2:05:34] us

[2:28:19] the secret to my Christian journey and
[2:28:23] the success of that walk no matter how

[2:28:29] it's that
[2:28:30] my motive
[2:28:32] as for his glory
[2:28:35] because you can't have two people living
[2:28:37] in the same vessel
[2:28:39] for your children

[2:28:53] Matthew 6 put God first and he'll do all
[2:28:54] these things for you
[2:28:56] what it really boils down to is it's for
[2:28:59] his glory and you life you just lay
[2:29:03] everything
[2:29:04] and you just live for him to completely
[2:29:07] and utterly
[2:29:08] because I'm sure that everybody in here
[2:29:11] loves the supernatural
[2:29:14] can I get an amen

[2:29:20] supernatural things that you can't
[2:29:22] explain things that are above physics
[2:29:24] and above the Sciences of this world
[2:29:27] if you want to see more of that
[2:29:31] may your motive your life your whole
[2:29:34] thrust be for his glory
[2:29:36] may your job may your aspirations and
[2:29:39] all of your motives be for his glory
[2:29:41] don't do it for yours amen

[2:43:16] it and um I'm just thankful that he's
[2:43:19] been keeping the fellowship in Dunedin
[2:43:21] and
[2:43:22] the Saints there I'm just very thankful
[2:43:24] that he uses every single one I know we
[2:43:26] may be a small group but the law sees it
[2:43:29] and I remember brother said he weighs
[2:43:31] the hearts and I know that he does and
[2:43:34] I'm thankful that
[2:43:36] I guess it may get even tougher but
[2:43:39] we're just thankful that God's kept us
[2:43:42] this far and it doesn't mean that things
[2:43:45] will change with God because he never
[2:43:47] he always stays the same so I'm thankful
[2:43:49] that he has his word by his word we can
[2:43:51] overcome amen

[2:44:21] just thankful
[2:44:22] um to the Lord just for helping me
[2:44:24] throughout this year
[2:44:26] and I feel like
[2:44:28] every year there's going to be
[2:44:30] uncertainties a lot but
[2:44:33] I'm just thankful that the Lord has kept
[2:44:35] me and
[2:44:36] sometimes I'm really blessed by like the
[2:44:38] watch night services because
[2:44:42] it makes me realize how much God has
[2:44:44] done throughout the whole year I mean
[2:44:45] it's like oh you recognize wow God
[2:44:47] you've killed me so long
[2:44:49] and um
[2:44:50] yeah I just want to share like two
[2:44:52] things I really
[2:44:54] thankful for that the Lord has really
[2:44:56] um
[2:44:59] showed me is that like
[2:45:01] to really appreciate the small things in
[2:45:04] life
[2:45:05] and
[2:45:08] another thing is just to have good
[2:45:11] balance in life as well and different
[2:45:13] things
[2:45:14] and um
[2:45:15] I'm just so blessed by that and just to
[2:45:19] even though it may feel like it's just
[2:45:21] so hard sometimes
[2:45:23] I feel like God has taught me a lot of
[2:45:25] patience and to just
[2:45:27] um keep trusting in Him but I'm thankful
[2:45:29] and thank you I'm thankful that all of
[2:45:31] you are here as well
[2:45:39] but the fruit of the spirit is love

[2:46:34] it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hack
[2:46:36] and Dylan gently unto the voice of the
[2:46:39] Lord thy God to observe and to do all
[2:46:41] his Commandments which I command thee

[2:46:59] verses after that that's blessings and
[2:47:02] all the other words after there's curses
[2:47:04] so I'm glad to be able to read the
[2:47:07] blessings one and that the Lord is
[2:47:09] faithful in that you know that's all we
[2:47:12] have to do is follow in what He commands
[2:47:14] us to do and he definitely blesses us so

[2:50:25] one thing that's really blessed me
[2:50:27] lately is
[2:50:29] um I think somebody had said to brother
[2:50:31] Brown I'm
[2:50:32] how she'd rather be in the word than
[2:50:35] in heaven okay I can't remember exactly
[2:50:38] but she said
[2:50:40] um I'd rather be found in the word than
[2:50:41] in than in heaven or Earth because
[2:50:45] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[2:50:47] word will never pass away and I've just
[2:50:49] been pondering that quite a lot and um
[2:50:51] yeah I just
[2:50:54] I believe if we keep in the word then
[2:50:57] we can run our last mile home praise the
[2:51:00] Lord

[2:52:06] of my trials for this year
[2:52:09] way after that I couldn't see it or do

[2:59:34] I like what you did Brother Isaac I love
[2:59:36] that very much when everyone participate
[2:59:39] when everyone reads a scripture then you
[2:59:41] personalize things that's the only place
[2:59:43] where you must take things personal is
[2:59:45] when you come to the word of God
[2:59:47] otherwise don't take things personal
[2:59:51] don't take things personal
[2:59:52] one day

[3:00:22] daughter said no dad you're missing the
[3:00:25] point this is not about you
[3:00:28] I said what a painful statement but it
[3:00:30] was the truth
[3:00:32] sometimes we think things are is about
[3:00:34] us when it's not about you but on the
[3:00:37] end he likes to say You must look at the
[3:00:39] bigger picture

[3:03:56] now we come here Isaac makes me the main
[3:03:59] one and he just read scripture
[3:04:03] I think this yes must talk about this
[3:04:06] anyway
[3:04:08] I started to ponder and ask God what
[3:04:11] must I talk about
[3:04:12] Lord I don't want just to speak to the
[3:04:15] people the imagination of my of my mind
[3:04:18] and thoughts I want to speak your word
[3:04:20] and father God only you can speak to
[3:04:23] your people and the Lord said hey
[3:04:25] go and make a revision
[3:04:28] because I never change if if you don't
[3:04:30] pass a question paper for the Lord
[3:04:33] the Lord will give you the same question
[3:04:35] paper every time until you pass it and
[3:04:38] he will tell you you're going to write a
[3:04:40] test same one same time same examiner
[3:04:45] everything until you pass it and with
[3:04:48] the Lord pass Mark is hundred percent
[3:04:49] not 99
[3:04:52] I love you for that so now we're just
[3:04:54] gonna do a revision just to catch up on
[3:04:56] what we spoke about this year
[3:04:58] and the sermons that I obviously I
[3:05:01] cannot speak about all of them but we're
[3:05:03] just gonna take those titles and I
[3:05:06] wonder I wonder how many on the floor
[3:05:09] can remember one title of the sermon
[3:05:12] that I preached or that we spoke about
[3:05:14] that I spoke about with you this year
[3:05:18] I wonder
[3:05:19] uh can I see any hints
[3:05:22] overcoming power amen another one
[3:05:25] more
[3:05:27] The Sixth Sense
[3:05:29] another one
[3:05:32] will you marry me that's that's my
[3:05:34] favorite one ah another one
[3:05:39] you forgot that's why we are doing
[3:05:41] revision
[3:05:43] that's why we are doing a summary what
[3:05:45] they call a synopsis that's what we'll
[3:05:47] do tonight but the Bible says you know
[3:05:49] even so come Lord Jesus because the one
[3:05:52] who said these things
[3:05:54] the one who says these things he really
[3:05:56] means
[3:05:57] is me it means business but the world
[3:05:59] can see you see the world can hear it
[3:06:02] but he's the one who said these things
[3:06:04] he says I come
[3:06:06] quickly
[3:06:07] now
[3:06:08] at my work you know every every morning
[3:06:11] we have a meeting and everyone must say
[3:06:13] how you feel out of five one to five how
[3:06:16] you feel then we've got a feeling of how
[3:06:18] everyone feels and we know how to
[3:06:20] approach you today and we talk about
[3:06:22] work and what is the plan and everything
[3:06:24] and then so the team leader likes to say
[3:06:26] hey
[3:06:27] and what is an engagement question what
[3:06:29] can we talk about just give us anything
[3:06:31] then she just chooses anyone what can we
[3:06:34] talk about what are you going to eat for
[3:06:35] Christmas what's the plan you know those
[3:06:36] can just to break their eyes so today
[3:06:38] she said um
[3:06:41] what are you going to do differently in
[3:06:43] 2022
[3:06:45] you know she's asked through that
[3:06:46] question and everybody says Ah I'm going
[3:06:48] to exercise this I'm going to I'm going
[3:06:51] to try to be fit in 2022. another one
[3:06:53] said I'm gonna try to leave my smoking
[3:06:55] habit
[3:06:56] and then and she just called names names
[3:06:58] by and then another one say oh this is
[3:07:00] I'm going to to try to eat healthy
[3:07:03] and then a lot of people said I'm going
[3:07:05] to try to exercise and be fit and I said
[3:07:08] what am I going to say this is an
[3:07:10] opportunity for me to throw a bomb
[3:07:13] do you know a bomb
[3:07:16] I said to her you know seen that every
[3:07:19] one of you is concentrating on the
[3:07:21] physique
[3:07:22] me in 2022 I'm going to have a a closer
[3:07:26] relationship with God
[3:07:28] I almost cried when I I I had I had a
[3:07:33] deafening silence
[3:07:36] a different Silence from all the
[3:07:39] excitement and the laughing and the
[3:07:41] smiling I just saw the hidden the head
[3:07:43] the head and loading
[3:07:45] seriously
[3:07:47] I said my
[3:07:49] I said I said this year I want to focus
[3:07:52] on my relationship with God and I and I
[3:07:54] stopped there
[3:07:56] amen then for a second my team leader
[3:07:59] realized that everyone is quiet she just
[3:08:00] said oh that's nice that's nice
[3:08:02] then we said okay
[3:08:04] then then we move to the next next
[3:08:05] person said I I'm gonna be feed this
[3:08:08] year then the noise come back again yes
[3:08:10] yes or even me and then then I realize
[3:08:13] that oh Lord there's something here but
[3:08:15] thank you for allowing me to throw the
[3:08:16] bomb
[3:08:19] uh no
[3:08:21] no you are very very safe
[3:08:24] when
[3:08:25] you are in the middle of the storm have
[3:08:28] you heard this before because the pool
[3:08:31] that is coming
[3:08:32] the sister spoke about trials this year
[3:08:34] stationon spoke about it Elizabeth spoke
[3:08:37] about it you know there were testimonies
[3:08:40] you see let me tell you something let me
[3:08:43] guarantee you this is a guarantee
[3:08:46] let me give you a guarantee this is one
[3:08:49] thing for sure
[3:08:51] trials and temptations are going to be
[3:08:54] added more
[3:08:55] in 2022
[3:08:58] that's what I want to just to make it
[3:09:00] clear before we can go further they are
[3:09:02] going to be more
[3:09:05] more are coming
[3:09:06] and brother Isaac said almost I almost
[3:09:09] put words in his mouth
[3:09:10] he he came to me as if he said you know
[3:09:13] bring them on
[3:09:16] why how can you say bring them on you
[3:09:18] are so insensitive brother Paul you're
[3:09:21] not careful you don't know what you're
[3:09:22] talking about no I know
[3:09:24] because you are me and you are very
[3:09:28] privileged to be in the middle of the
[3:09:31] tornado
[3:09:33] do you know a tornado
[3:09:35] if you are on the outskirts of the
[3:09:37] tornado you are in a very catastrophic
[3:09:41] spot
[3:09:43] you are in a very dangerous position
[3:09:45] because everything under periphery on
[3:09:48] the outside of the tornado it's
[3:09:52] squid I don't know I don't have a right
[3:09:54] weight
[3:09:55] but it dies it just disappears it breaks
[3:10:00] everything on the outside so but
[3:10:02] it was the storm we sing a song here
[3:10:07] we sing a song here in the middle of
[3:10:11] that storm
[3:10:12] Ah that's where he is and that's where
[3:10:14] the eagle is cruising in the middle of
[3:10:16] the storm so don't worry be in the
[3:10:19] middle

[3:10:22] storm

[3:10:35] remembers that one well life well love
[3:10:39] and Faith meet what happens
[3:10:42] that was one of the questions we spoke
[3:10:44] about this year what happens in when
[3:10:47] they meet there in your soul what
[3:10:49] happens we said you'll find a soul mate
[3:10:53] what happens when When Love and Faith
[3:10:56] meet I won't be long
[3:10:58] another one that we spoke about this
[3:11:00] year I'm just gonna go through them
[3:11:03] what house will you build me remember
[3:11:05] that one what house
[3:11:08] will you build me huh because heaven is
[3:11:11] my
[3:11:12] and the egg is mine so what house are
[3:11:16] you going to build me
[3:11:17] what house the tallest building in
[3:11:20] Malaysia is it still Malaysia or Dubai

[3:11:22] Dubai what what house can you build me
[3:11:25] what do they call it Mount Califa what
[3:11:27] is it the total one can you build me a
[3:11:30] house like that one
[3:11:32] what house are you going to build me he
[3:11:35] needs a house where he can dwell and
[3:11:38] that is in the middle of your heart in
[3:11:41] the soul that's where he that's the
[3:11:43] mansion
[3:11:45] which you can build him where he can sit
[3:11:48] don't be on the outer court on the
[3:11:50] middle be in the inner in the holy of
[3:11:54] that's the house that we can build for
[3:11:56] the Lord when you the queen and him are
[3:11:59] they that's the house we can build him
[3:12:01] are we together and then we spoke about
[3:12:05] transforming back to where you were
[3:12:08] before hey this one you know the word of
[3:12:12] God just excites me that's why I'm
[3:12:13] laughing like this
[3:12:15] we said you know
[3:12:17] God's power of transformation
[3:12:20] there was nothing sister Shannon there
[3:12:22] was absolutely nothing do you know to
[3:12:24] say nothing is an understatement we
[3:12:27] can't imagine what nothing was before
[3:12:30] the creation but the God's power to
[3:12:33] transform said let there be the Bible
[3:12:35] says the spirit of God was above the
[3:12:38] Deep what is the Deep what what it was
[3:12:40] where where
[3:12:42] but there was nothing
[3:12:43] it was Darkness and he said let there be
[3:12:46] light and the power of God are there to
[3:12:48] transform and the locals came
[3:12:51] running Maybe
[3:12:53] 300 and billion miles a second out of
[3:12:57] his mouth
[3:13:01] and the logos came and he said stop you
[3:13:03] know the prophet dramatize it and then
[3:13:06] there was light what was that it was the
[3:13:09] God's power
[3:13:10] to transform
[3:13:12] what makes a butterfly to break out of
[3:13:15] that cocoon is God's power of
[3:13:17] transformation because it is his word he
[3:13:20] said let there be and the Butterfly have
[3:13:23] you ever seen a little chick hatching
[3:13:25] you know don't help it
[3:13:28] you are not God's power to transport no
[3:13:31] your hands are not there God's power of
[3:13:33] transformation will help if you help it
[3:13:37] because there is a power there to help
[3:13:39] it to transform that's what we spoke
[3:13:41] about today so don't try to help God in
[3:13:44] your life all you need to do you
[3:13:47] allow God's power to transform to change
[3:13:50] you as we cross over in 2022 think about
[3:13:54] the Israelites when they were crossing
[3:13:57] when they were crossing into the
[3:13:59] promised land brother Isaac when they
[3:14:01] were crossing
[3:14:02] on on that night how did it feel what
[3:14:05] they oh we're crossing oh no
[3:14:09] they were not when the Midnight Cry came
[3:14:12] out
[3:14:14] and they say hello
[3:14:16] you know in Africa when there's a bride
[3:14:19] and the bread we don't say
[3:14:21] no no no we Shout
[3:14:23] because the bridegroom has arrived and
[3:14:26] the bride is coming out to meet him we
[3:14:29] say wow
[3:14:32] what do you say
[3:14:36] brother we say
[3:14:41] the bridegroom has arrived and everybody
[3:14:44] wakes up
[3:14:46] everybody wakes up
[3:14:48] in the Bible
[3:14:50] the Bible says they started to prepare
[3:14:52] their lamps
[3:14:53] because the bridegroom has arrived huh
[3:14:57] we are crossing over now physically we
[3:14:59] might be crossing over in 2022 yes we
[3:15:02] are closing but actually we are on the
[3:15:04] bridge
[3:15:05] of crossing over into heaven the sound
[3:15:08] has come out Reuben what did he say
[3:15:19] because you see
[3:15:22] when the bridegroom comes
[3:15:24] he's coming to fetch a bride
[3:15:26] he are very happy for the bride to be
[3:15:29] joined in with the bridegroom
[3:15:32] you're so happy when these young girls
[3:15:33] get married we get so happy you know
[3:15:35] there's nothing about God's power to
[3:15:39] transform to bring one and one to one
[3:15:44] you know the gods mathematics is not one
[3:15:46] plus one is two no no is Stephen and
[3:15:49] Tessa is one
[3:15:52] one equal to one of course mathematics
[3:15:57] Isaac Shannon you think he's two one so
[3:16:01] when when when that power to transform
[3:16:03] two into one come
[3:16:06] when it happens How can there be
[3:16:08] quietness how can you see it and say
[3:16:11] okay ah yeah the Lord the lord loves us
[3:16:14] huh the lord loves us
[3:16:16] yes he loves us therefore we must we
[3:16:19] must come here and jump
[3:16:21] in reality not to show off huh so that's
[3:16:25] what happens when God's power to
[3:16:28] transform takes place
[3:16:29] we we get so happy when a new baby come
[3:16:32] why who who can tell me here brothers
[3:16:35] and sisters have you ever seen I spoke
[3:16:37] about it before everything that is a
[3:16:40] baby that is born is so beautiful
[3:16:43] you can think of a puppy even a little
[3:16:46] snake poison us
[3:16:48] so nice the prophet says oh it's so
[3:16:50] beautiful when you look that little
[3:16:51] beautiful colorful snake that's the
[3:16:53] prophet it's not me he said that you
[3:16:55] know you
[3:16:56] you see a little
[3:16:58] cheek so fluffy my Guru so fluffy so
[3:17:02] soft and a puppy have you ever seen it a
[3:17:05] little baboon everything that is in you

[3:17:10] have you ever smelled the smell of a new
[3:17:12] car inside

[3:17:18] new
[3:17:22] everything that is new
[3:17:24] it's beautiful
[3:17:27] and a new life is beautiful
[3:17:29] that's how the Lord feel when your life
[3:17:31] transforms when your life is new
[3:17:34] Ah that's how that's excitement for the
[3:17:37] Lord he says Ah that the Lord does not
[3:17:40] know what to do with you
[3:17:42] he just want to Rapture you
[3:17:44] take you home you are not worthy to be
[3:17:47] here on this Earth well when when your
[3:17:50] life reaches that point when he saw
[3:17:52] remember there's someone from Isaac

[3:20:40] is wonderful it's one step in the right
[3:20:42] direction
[3:20:44] but
[3:20:46] has helped that spirit
[3:20:48] not a religious one right
[3:20:51] how many remembers this one I was very
[3:20:54] dramatic when I preached this one
[3:20:56] because I wanted to warn you that hey
[3:20:58] brothers and sisters let us not be in a
[3:21:01] religious spirit
[3:21:03] but let's be in the Holy Spirit within
[3:21:05] our religion
[3:21:07] let's have the Holy Spirit then we spoke
[3:21:09] about the purchasing power of Faith oh
[3:21:11] brother and he jumped when I came with
[3:21:13] this one because he's a businessman you
[3:21:14] know that if they give him a precious in
[3:21:16] power that means his business is strong
[3:21:18] he can buy more
[3:21:20] huh he's kill Kitty so the patient faith
[3:21:24] has got such a powerful pictures in
[3:21:25] power you back again with anyone when
[3:21:28] you've got faith you you no one can beat
[3:21:30] you your patience in power is so strong
[3:21:32] you come in they sit down see I want
[3:21:35] that one because he's got such a strong
[3:21:37] purchase in power and we must use it we
[3:21:41] must not live like how I spoke to two
[3:21:43] Sundays ago or two Wednesdays when we
[3:21:45] said living below your privilege no no
[3:21:47] no we've got their patience in power
[3:21:52] we are not on credit we don't owe anyone
[3:21:54] the Lord has already paid it and the
[3:21:56] patience in power is so powerful
[3:21:58] so that's what we spoke about and the
[3:22:00] purchasing power we we spoke about the
[3:22:02] love of Abraham how he had faith and you
[3:22:05] know how Abraham could do anything
[3:22:06] anything literally
[3:22:08] how can you say your son Must Die
[3:22:11] what I mean because you know that the
[3:22:13] one who who who will take his life he
[3:22:16] will resurrect him instantly that's what
[3:22:19] we know that's how Peter zimba Faith
[3:22:21] does not work according to this world
[3:22:22] and then we spoke about
[3:22:24] um
[3:22:25] overcoming power part one how many
[3:22:28] remember this one we spoke about they
[3:22:30] were overcoming power we are still
[3:22:31] waiting for overcoming power part 100
[3:22:33] but I think we went up to part three or
[3:22:37] four
[3:22:38] in part one we spoke about not not not
[3:22:41] by might
[3:22:43] huh no by power
[3:22:46] but by my spirit say the Lord and we
[3:22:50] said that's how they build the Temple of
[3:22:52] Jerusalem and
[3:22:54] them it was a hard time of Israel and it
[3:22:58] is a hard time now my sister my brother
[3:23:00] not by might
[3:23:02] no no but by the transforming power of
[3:23:05] God we are going here he will see us
[3:23:07] through amen and we spoke about
[3:23:09] overcoming power part two that's what it
[3:23:11] was a continuation we spoke about what
[3:23:13] does it take to have that overcoming
[3:23:15] power how many remembers that one and
[3:23:17] then we said we read Romans chapter
[3:23:18] three and we said we find that every
[3:23:21] time time there is a rebuilding or
[3:23:24] transformation or renewal or Revival of
[3:23:27] a temple or a person in person's life
[3:23:29] your Jerusalem there is a war
[3:23:36] he said
[3:23:39] today we are going to This Means War
[3:23:42] it's not a joke
[3:23:44] sometimes we think
[3:23:46] it's a it's a joke I'm I'm finishing
[3:23:48] brother Isaac
[3:23:50] and then
[3:23:51] my first sermon that I preached in New
[3:23:53] Zealand
[3:23:55] is the one that I pray to sister moodly
[3:23:57] and she asked for more but I didn't have
[3:23:59] more
[3:24:01] we spoke her I was still here I was so
[3:24:03] fascinated about the firstborn you
[3:24:05] remember my sister
[3:24:06] and I said the firstborn you know
[3:24:08] there's something it's not because I'm
[3:24:09] the firstborn no it's not about me
[3:24:12] it's not about me but you see you are
[3:24:15] the firstborns you are the tithing of
[3:24:19] the Lord you
[3:24:21] without you there's no Harvest
[3:24:24] without without who you there's no
[3:24:25] Harvest
[3:24:27] did you you remember the song for the
[3:24:29] Isaac that he wrote
[3:24:33] that song is so deep for me for me but
[3:24:37] as we are singing that song I can see
[3:24:39] them the Reapers I can see them moving
[3:24:42] in the field Winter's coming and they're
[3:24:45] reaping and there's a chili and you know
[3:24:46] the season is changing and they're
[3:24:48] eating
[3:24:49] and they're piling them in the in the in
[3:24:52] the in the storehouse there so you
[3:24:56] are the tithing of the Lord
[3:24:59] so the firstborn the Church of the
[3:25:03] firstborn is you
[3:25:05] so never under allow the devil to to
[3:25:09] trick you
[3:25:11] as we cross over make a shout in your
[3:25:14] heart for the Lord make a very loud
[3:25:17] noise to the Lord and say thank you Lord
[3:25:20] for we are crossing over we are crossing
[3:25:22] over into 2022 with a bang
[3:25:28] [Music]
[3:25:29] with you in this boat let the storm come
[3:25:34] and we must be ready we must be ready
[3:25:37] sometimes we say bring the storm on when
[3:25:39] it comes we cry it's nice to classify
[3:25:42] but we must take it by faith knowing
[3:25:46] that the one who we have whom we have he
[3:25:49] can say to the storm stop you can
[3:25:51] actually say Lord I saw you stopping
[3:25:54] this the storm
[3:25:55] the waves I want you to give me that
[3:25:58] opportunity my father because you said I
[3:26:00] will do greater things I want to stop
[3:26:02] that storm maybe you gave me this tire
[3:26:05] to test me to allow me to ask you to
[3:26:08] stop it and it comes you see you in the
[3:26:12] name of our Lord Jesus Christ you are
[3:26:13] going to stop because I saw my father
[3:26:16] doing this and I've asked you Lord is it
[3:26:18] your will I want to stop that thing I
[3:26:21] want to stop these thoughts that come to
[3:26:23] my mind and I know it's the devil I want
[3:26:26] Lord you to kill them
[3:26:28] 2022
[3:26:30] let them come but I want them to die
[3:26:33] they are not going to have any effect on
[3:26:35] me amen so that is our attitude as we go
[3:26:37] in 2022 and then we spoke about the
[3:26:40] little negatives becoming the positives
[3:26:44] remember the little Shadows that I
[3:26:45] brought here and I said the New
[3:26:48] Testament is just a shadow here the body
[3:26:50] that we are wearing now is just a
[3:26:52] negative
[3:26:53] there is real reality when it is busy
[3:26:56] being developed is busy being processed
[3:26:59] and that process of cleaning is not an
[3:27:01] easy one I can tell you if we can put
[3:27:04] you with the clothes in the in the in
[3:27:05] the machine you will know that the
[3:27:07] process of washing is not an easy one
[3:27:10] you will know
[3:27:11] how much more percentification
[3:27:14] much more about baptism of the Holy
[3:27:15] Spirit that's fire
[3:27:17] your band
[3:27:19] and you become new
[3:27:21] out of that chaos a good chaos
[3:27:25] call it a good destruction that's what
[3:27:28] we call it amen so that's what we spoke
[3:27:30] about some of the sermons this year and
[3:27:32] I wanted to take this few Summoners that
[3:27:35] we spoke about this year just to reflect
[3:27:36] let to reflect on them
[3:27:38] just to let you think that Lord thank
[3:27:40] you so much for allowing us to see 2022
[3:27:43] as we cross over I think of Joshua and
[3:27:46] Caleb I think of them and the Jews
[3:27:49] following them the young we call them in
[3:27:51] Africans the young Spanish
[3:27:53] the young people crossing because all
[3:27:56] the ones the old ones died
[3:28:01] you're going to cross
[3:28:04] and then you are going to cross bravely
[3:28:07] amen decide on Sunday we are going to
[3:28:09] sacrifice for the Lord and we are going
[3:28:11] to Cross by the grace of God that's what
[3:28:14] we are going to do tonight we are going
[3:28:16] to go into 2022 without fear without
[3:28:19] prejudice why because you've had
[3:28:22] testimonies what God has done this year
[3:28:24] it's not all what we do it's not all
[3:28:26] that brother there God healed him of
[3:28:28] cancer brother Bondo cancer
[3:28:32] that's why the prophet even preached a
[3:28:34] sermon
[3:28:35] do you fear cancer
[3:28:37] because God told me specifically about
[3:28:39] that demon he's not not even cancer will
[3:28:41] stand before you and brother Brahman is
[3:28:43] the way of shift you are the all the
[3:28:46] Harvest not cancer will stand before you
[3:28:48] that's the testimony there you can visit
[3:28:50] the brother he'll tell you everything
[3:28:51] he'll tell you about the day the little
[3:28:53] Dove came on the window just like when
[3:28:56] they prayed for Florence Nightingale in
[3:28:57] London the little window came in cool
[3:29:00] cool and then it left just a video for
[3:29:03] it did you showed to show the church
[3:29:06] those are the testimonies he said
[3:29:08] greater things
[3:29:10] shall you do so brother and sister what
[3:29:12] am I saying don't underestimate the
[3:29:15] power of God
[3:29:16] and that power of God is in your life
[3:29:19] is in my life young people

[4:06:52] confess something you know the Bible
[4:06:54] says if your heart condemns you're not
[4:06:56] so mine is to be condemned just forgive
[4:06:58] me
[4:07:00] the pastor does not force us to come
[4:07:02] stand here so I gave an impression that
[4:07:06] he forced me and he told me late and I'm
[4:07:10] throwing him under the bus no that's not
[4:07:12] the case
[4:07:13] I just want to make that clear because
[4:07:15] the devil can just hold on a stick
[4:07:18] he's the accuser of Believers so the
[4:07:21] pastor asked us and then there was no
[4:07:24] need to mention what time so that was
[4:07:26] necessary may the Lord forgive me so the
[4:07:28] pastor asked us as ministers we are
[4:07:31] available in season and out of
[4:07:34] may the Lord just
[4:07:37] well I really appreciate the word
[4:07:38] tonight and
[4:07:40] yeah
[4:07:41] um I'm going to close the service now
[4:07:43] that's we're done so thank you all God
[4:07:46] bless you all
[4:07:49] go forth and prosper and all that you do
[4:07:53] and I like that bro Faith outbids doubt
[4:07:57] anytime there's an auction on you know
[4:07:59] we've got a bit here you know doubt will
[4:08:01] burn this much
[4:08:02] Faith bids a bit more doubt puts us much
[4:08:04] Faith bids a bit more faith has always
[4:08:07] got the funds in the bank to be out beat
[4:08:09] any but any bit of Doubt so in any
[4:08:12] situation you're in faith is going to
[4:08:14] outfit and when
[4:08:16] so God bless you all
