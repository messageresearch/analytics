[8:24] praise the lord god bless you everyone
[8:28] welcome to church this morning amen
[8:31] who's happy to be here we have such a
[8:35] great opportunity that lays before us
[8:38] probably the best opportunity outside of
[8:40] accepting christ the best opportunity
[8:42] that we've had today
[8:44] is right now you know because every day
[8:46] with the lord gets better every every
[8:49] every every decision we make for him is
[8:51] always the
[8:52] the better one of all of the decisions
[8:53] we've ever made so this is actually the
[8:56] greatest opportunity that we've
[8:57] ever had that lays before us right now
[9:00] to enter into the holiest of holies
[9:02] and to to worship the lord and to to
[9:05] make another stand
[9:06] amen there was a lady
[9:09] [Music]
[9:10] that was um i think she was blind and
[9:13] deaf
[9:15] but she always used to go to church and
[9:16] people would sort of make fun of her for
[9:18] going to church you know they say what
[9:19] do you go
[9:19] why do you always go to church you can't
[9:22] see anything
[9:22] you can't hear anything it's almost
[9:25] pointless that you go along
[9:27] but she said you know i go to church
[9:29] because i like to let the devil know
[9:30] what side i'm on
[9:33] but we're thankful that we can we can
[9:35] see and we can hear and we can perceive
[9:36] so we have got such a great opportunity
[9:39] for us this morning to
[9:41] to worship god um just before we start
[9:43] brother ed is
[9:44] has got to come up and do something
[9:48] inform us of the new world order plans
[10:03] [Music]
[10:14] there we go yes yes so unfortunately
[10:17] we do uh have a government with
[10:21] with rules and they've changed it up a
[10:24] bit
[10:25] so we've got a few different levels and
[10:26] different regions
[10:28] um at this point we are in level two
[10:31] that for us require just to sign on so
[10:34] if you haven't sign on please there's a
[10:35] little
[10:36] uh qr code here at the the entrance
[10:39] if you can sign in we thought it would
[10:42] be a good opportunity just to
[10:43] tell you again about the exit so the x's
[10:46] is where you came in this morning
[10:48] there's another one uh basically behind
[10:50] sister belinda so
[10:51] as you go out into the foyer on the
[10:53] right there's a exit
[10:55] and please use that in the case of
[10:58] emergency there is
[10:59] hand sanitizers at the back and at the
[11:02] front where you come in
[11:03] at church there is face masks if you
[11:06] choose to
[11:07] want to wear one we
[11:11] also want to um so with the sanctuary
[11:15] we want to keep it reverent as well and
[11:17] everyone that's
[11:19] here is is sort of in a in an atmosphere
[11:22] of worship and we really want to keep
[11:24] that
[11:26] so we have the foyer we are not
[11:28] privileged
[11:29] in like certain churches that have you
[11:32] know a
[11:33] massive separated building where you can
[11:36] go and fellowship
[11:37] apologies for that but through the door
[11:40] there at brother key bends that is our
[11:42] foyer
[11:43] and through the hallway out on the
[11:46] um basically to sister jenny's house on
[11:50] the other side that's our
[11:51] our fellowship area so adults and then
[11:54] kids
[11:55] could you could you keep this as
[11:58] reverent as you possibly can
[12:00] so i me i will try and not stand in
[12:03] fellowship behind the sound desk
[12:05] i will i will try and be the the example
[12:08] but then when we when we gather and want
[12:10] to go through the door
[12:12] please if you decide whether you want to
[12:14] go through the door and
[12:15] to the back to sister genies or if the
[12:18] children want to go out to the
[12:20] to the outside on the at the entrance
[12:23] side um make that decision and then we
[12:25] can sort of keep the door closed as well
[12:27] um otherwise it's open and shut and open
[12:29] and sharp and we just
[12:30] lose a bit of that atmosphere in here i
[12:33] think that was it hey brother
[12:34] ben so thank you and um yeah
[12:38] thank you for your tolerance with all
[12:39] these levels and everything uh
[12:41] well let's try and abide by the rules
[12:44] aye god bless you
[12:46] amen
[12:51] praise the lord let's um let's stand
[12:53] this morning we'll just open up
[12:55] in prayer we live in very exciting times
[13:02] our our different freedoms may be
[13:04] eroding by the day but
[13:06] we're free in christ so who cares
[13:10] we're free in christ amen let's not
[13:13] saying that that was but you know we we
[13:14] know what's happening we know that the
[13:16] what's going to come upon the world but
[13:18] we don't have to fear
[13:20] we don't have to get worried we don't
[13:21] have to actually rearrange anything
[13:23] we're already on the right path we just
[13:25] keep doing what we're doing just keep
[13:26] worshiping the lord
[13:27] keep praising him you know even in
[13:28] paul's time there was a lot of political
[13:30] turmoil in paul's time
[13:33] a lot you know they were they were they
[13:34] were um countries being overthrown and
[13:37] political systems coming in and like
[13:40] jerusalem was being taken over and all
[13:41] those sorts of things but
[13:42] you read in the gospels you read nothing
[13:44] of it
[13:45] all he did was preach christ and him
[13:47] crucified and he just pressed on that
[13:48] way he wouldn't
[13:49] you think the world was in complete
[13:50] peace and nothing was going on
[13:52] because that's really what we're called
[13:53] to do and we're going to keep on doing
[13:55] it regardless of what happens
[13:56] amen let's just pray this morning lord
[13:59] jesus we thank you that we can be
[14:00] gathered here this morning
[14:02] lord and in this place lord where we can
[14:05] where we can be free in you lord jesus
[14:07] we just thank you lord that
[14:09] that amongst all the turmoil lord that
[14:10] we can we can come to you
[14:13] lord whether whether as paul said
[14:15] whether we're bond or whether we're free
[14:16] we're all free men in christ
[14:17] lord said we just thank you for that
[14:19] lord jesus we thank you for the exciting
[14:21] times that we're living in lord that we
[14:22] can
[14:23] that we know we're not we're not walking
[14:25] and blindly lord but we know what your
[14:26] prophet has spoken of we know what your
[14:28] word has spoken of
[14:30] lord and we see these negative things
[14:31] but we also know lord that it's a
[14:33] harvest time lord that
[14:35] that the seed that's in us lord is going
[14:37] to come to
[14:39] full maturity lord we are under great
[14:41] expectation for that to happen more and
[14:42] more in our lives lord jesus
[14:44] as we see the world go into darkness
[14:46] lord we thank you that that
[14:48] in our lives lord we can come into the
[14:49] complete light of your word and you lord
[14:51] jesus so we just
[14:53] we just thank you for that lord we thank
[14:54] you for the opportunity to press
[14:56] further into christ this morning that
[14:57] lays before us we pray that we would
[14:59] enter in lord and just lay aside
[15:01] anything that would hinder us from doing
[15:02] that
[15:03] bless brother ben as he ministers this
[15:06] morning lord and
[15:07] yeah may each heart just focus upon you
[15:09] this morning
[15:11] and make the most of this opportunity
[15:13] lord we've got we've set aside this
[15:14] building we've
[15:15] made all this effort lord but it's good
[15:18] but now we just want to let them
[15:20] the dynamics of the holy ghost come and
[15:22] take control of the service this morning
[15:24] lord so we we just commit the service to
[15:26] you lord forgive us of every sin lord
[15:27] anything that would
[15:28] that would separate us from you may you
[15:30] forgive us of that lord that we could
[15:32] come boldly before your throne of grace
[15:34] lord and that your spirit would could
[15:36] dwell with us peacefully this morning

[42:36] probably
[42:36] noticed that the tracker code's been put
[42:39] up we
[42:39] were using the guesthub app but now
[42:41] we're using a government app so
[42:43] in the words of ashley bloomfield i
[42:44] encourage you to use it and there's face
[42:46] masks as well we have available if you'd
[42:48] like to have a face mask on while you're
[42:49] in service
[42:50] just um there's a box at the front and
[42:52] there so you're more than welcome to
[42:53] take those
[42:54] but um you know i was thinking what if
[42:57] what if the um
[42:58] covert 19 you know the 1 pm updates what
[43:00] if it was actually like
[43:02] an uh reporting of the outbreak of the

[43:05] yeah and they said yesterday these many
[43:07] people received the holy ghost there's
[43:08] an outbreak in auckland there's an
[43:09] outbreak maybe there'd be an outbreak in
[43:11] wellington amen today hallelujah
[43:13] because we wouldn't be trying to avoid
[43:14] the place we were trying to get in
[43:16] lord where are you pouring yourself out
[43:18] i want to be right there
[43:19] hallelujah you know and how many have
[43:21] been hospitalized and so on you know how
[43:23] many have really got it you know
[43:25] amen so i pray there'll be a testimony
[43:29] report after this there was an outbreak
[43:31] of the holy ghost here in
[43:33] stokes valley amen hallelujah let's
[43:36] let's go to the scripture shall we um

[43:46] restrictions lift that everyone can come
[43:48] or whatever
[43:48] but we're still we're going to have camp
[43:50] lord willing so
[43:52] even if it just has to be us well it'll
[43:53] just be us but
[43:55] we'll see how we go so deuteronomy
[43:56] chapter 2
[43:58] and um verse 36
[44:06] um
[44:09] and then we're going to read uh we're

[44:13] joshua chapter one so this is this is uh
[44:17] moses speaking here too
[44:18] to the children of israel from ariel
[44:21] which is
[44:22] by the brink of the river uh arnon and
[44:25] from the
[44:26] city that is by the river even unto
[44:28] gilead
[44:29] there was not one city too strong for us
[44:31] the lord our god
[44:33] delivered all unto us and i think that
[44:36] was on the board last sunday but i just
[44:38] got it from it we'll take every city
[44:40] we're going to take every place that's
[44:41] ours hallelujah and joshua 1
[44:44] and from verse 2 down to verse 7.
[44:48] amen that's just what i got from that
[44:49] scripture he's saying this is what's
[44:51] happened but i'll say this is what's
[44:52] going to happen
[44:53] amen we're going to take every city
[44:54] every stronghold it's ours we're going

[45:07] i don't really need it but um
[45:10] most of uh i went old school i printed
[45:12] stuff off today

[45:18] and and verses 2 to 7 moses my servant
[45:21] is dead
[45:21] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[45:24] thou and all this people unto the land

[45:27] children of israel
[45:28] every place that the soul of your foot
[45:30] shall tread upon
[45:32] that have i given unto you as i said
[45:34] unto moses
[45:35] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[45:37] even into the great river the

[48:15] only you can
[48:16] in your wonderful name and name the lord
[48:17] jesus christ we ask these things
[48:20] amen amen amen god bless your friends
[48:22] have your seats this morning
[48:25] and um i want to let's see if i have it
[48:28] here so
[48:28] now we read here in joshua well well our
[48:31] opening scripture was was you know
[48:34] there was not uh one city too strong for
[48:36] us the lord our god delivered uh all
[48:39] unto us and as i said i believe we're
[48:40] gonna take every city
[48:42] see every divine promise that is in the
[48:44] word we're gonna take it
[48:45] now we now we must no we understand that
[48:48] the book has come open in this day every
[48:50] part of the land is available every
[48:52] promise is here from
[48:53] from even just receiving christ to to a
[48:56] body change and everything in between
[48:58] i mean is ours in this day amen so so we
[49:01] we have the promise today that we will
[49:03] be made in his very image in his very
[49:04] likeness which is the word
[49:06] i mean not just a partial realization
[49:08] but a full realization
[49:10] i mean that that that what the prophets
[49:13] of old looked for
[49:14] we are now in the season of receiving
[49:16] that promise
[49:17] but we must understand and i'm sure we
[49:20] know that there are giants in the land
[49:22] there's demon powers in the land to try
[49:24] and stop us
[49:25] from receiving the promise so just
[49:26] because the book is open
[49:28] it doesn't mean now we just sit back and
[49:29] relax and what will be we must press in
[49:32] amen press into the spirit of god and
[49:34] say lord i want everything that is mine
[49:37] everything you died for i would receive
[49:39] it hallelujah so this is why we say we
[49:41] will take every city
[49:42] i mean and and and the weapon we have
[49:45] is enough they'll say it's more than
[49:47] enough i mean this this word of god is
[49:49] more than enough
[49:50] to take every stronghold to cast out
[49:53] every demon power
[49:54] i mean to conquer everything that can be
[49:56] conquered hallelujah and so we
[49:59] can can rest assure we will take every
[50:01] city
[50:02] hallelujah sure we may just be we you
[50:04] know we may have just crossed
[50:05] jordan we may have just taken a part of
[50:07] the word i mean for ourselves but
[50:09] there's more to take or maybe we've
[50:10] taken a far more portion than that
[50:12] amen has become real to us but there's
[50:14] more to take and we must never ever
[50:16] become complacent
[50:18] or just settle back and say well we have
[50:21] enough because the problem with this
[50:22] age is the condition of this age is art
[50:25] rich and increased with goods have need
[50:26] of nothing
[50:27] and to say you have need of nothing as
[50:29] you say you have enough i mean so so we
[50:31] can't ever have that attitude we have
[50:33] enough
[50:33] we need more we need more of him every
[50:35] day we need more of him right
[50:37] i mean and that should be the burden of
[50:39] our hearts lord i want more of you
[50:41] i thank you for what you have done amen
[50:43] i'm not i'm not questioning that i'm
[50:45] saved lord you revealed to me that i'm
[50:47] saved your blood was shed for me
[50:49] i've been made a new creature in you but
[50:50] i want more hallelujah so i trust when
[50:53] i'm speaking these things you won't i'm
[50:54] not trying to say
[50:55] you're going to meet the lord again no
[50:57] no we're going to press on the battle
[50:58] amen because remember god is looking for
[51:00] a bride that's without spot or wrinkle
[51:02] made in his image amen and we are here
[51:05] to grow into that image but we know it's
[51:07] him doing it right
[51:08] it's not us doing it it's not human
[51:10] favor that'll do it in its own self it's
[51:12] god's spirit and a people
[51:14] that will produce what he's wanting to
[51:16] produce hallelujah now to be
[51:18] now i like this here in joshua because
[51:20] many times we will look at the scripture
[51:22] and
[51:23] and and we'll think well that was just
[51:24] for joshua or that was just for the
[51:26] prophet but we know it's not just for
[51:27] him
[51:28] because when joshua comes to the end of
[51:30] his road and he's and he's preaching his
[51:32] last service
[51:33] to israel he gives the same commission
[51:36] that he received is now putting on them
[51:38] he says be ye therefore very courageous
[51:41] to keep and to do all that's written in
[51:43] the book of the law of moses
[51:45] that ye turn not aside thereon from the
[51:47] right hand or to the left
[51:49] that sounds like what he what we read in
[51:51] chapter one right so the same commission
[51:53] that joshua received now the children
[51:55] have received
[51:56] that you come not among these nations
[51:58] that these remain among you neither make
[52:00] mention of the name of their gods
[52:01] nor cause to swear by them neither serve
[52:04] them nor bow yourselves
[52:06] unto them amen so so they received the
[52:09] same commission
[52:10] joshua received a commission from god
[52:12] and that same commission is passed down
[52:14] to every generation amen now we know the
[52:16] word strong
[52:17] it means to fasten upon to be constant
[52:20] to be established that's what means to
[52:21] be strong
[52:22] so it's not you know one way one way no
[52:25] just just
[52:26] be constant all my heart is yours lord
[52:29] everything i am belongs to you let every
[52:31] breath
[52:32] let all that i am never cease to worship
[52:34] you i mean so we should just make up
[52:36] our minds and i trust if you have keep
[52:38] pressing on if you haven't just make up
[52:40] your mind
[52:40] i'm going to serve you lord it doesn't
[52:42] matter what comes what goes i'm just
[52:45] gonna serve you
[52:46] hallelujah because we you know we must
[52:48] understand maybe i'll just
[52:50] you know i don't know what gear i'm in
[52:51] but hey i'll get somewhere and maybe
[52:53] i'll slow down who knows but you know
[52:55] we'll find a rest stop somewhere and
[52:56] we'll look at the view or something but
[52:58] you know
[52:59] we we must realize that we
[53:02] we are not gonna the bride will not be
[53:04] in some euphoric feeling
[53:06] and then a rapture will take place right
[53:09] you know you look at the resurrection in
[53:11] luke 24 were they in euphoria
[53:14] hey their sins are just being paid for
[53:16] but they weren't in a euphoria
[53:19] season they weren't rejoicing they
[53:20] weren't crying hosanna
[53:22] no they were broken their messiah had
[53:24] died
[53:25] this one died the ministry had locked
[53:27] themselves away the treasure of the
[53:28] church had committed suicide their world
[53:30] had fallen apart
[53:32] and they were living in the season of
[53:33] the resurrection
[53:35] so it's not it's not going to be some
[53:36] euphoria that comes over us and now i'm
[53:38] rapture ready
[53:40] hallelujah they weren't in their way
[53:42] they were the opposite but yet the lord
[53:44] walked with them
[53:45] and walked with them until they saw him
[53:47] and they realized that he was a
[53:48] fulfillment of the scripture
[53:50] and now the lord is here today and
[53:51] walking with us to make us realize that
[53:53] we
[53:54] are the fulfillment of the scripture i
[53:56] mean as you know the prophet said as
[53:58] jesus fulfilled the old testament the
[54:00] bride will fulfill the news
[54:01] hallelujah so that's why he's walking
[54:03] with us i mean that's why our hearts
[54:05] burn within us as he speaks to us
[54:07] why because he's wanting us to realize
[54:09] you are here to fulfill
[54:11] the new testament hallelujah
[54:15] they weren't rejoicing they were broken
[54:19] so it's not going to be euphoria oh i've
[54:21] got to feel happy therefore i've got the
[54:22] victory no
[54:24] they had the victory they they had
[54:26] overcome the beast system in their day
[54:28] had they bowed to the scribes and
[54:30] pharisees oh no
[54:32] right they were walking with the
[54:33] promised word and they died this is how
[54:35] they're feeling
[54:36] because they didn't understand what was
[54:37] going on so
[54:39] i just say that because don't expect to
[54:41] feel some euphoria
[54:44] and that's why i can be such a battle we
[54:45] have a camp and god just comes down and
[54:48] it comes down and it comes down some
[54:49] more that comes down again
[54:51] and it feels like it's just cloud9 why
[54:53] because the devil's just cast out of
[54:55] everywhere we're like in a bubble
[54:56] hollow isolation bubble of the holy
[54:58] ghost and everything's wonderful
[55:01] and then we think well and then then
[55:03] maybe you just gave your hearts a little
[55:04] neck kind of atmosphere because because
[55:05] we need that kind of atmosphere
[55:07] but then we go out and then you think
[55:09] this is how i'm just going to be all the
[55:10] time
[55:11] and then we find out no it's not the
[55:13] case and begin to question did it was
[55:14] that really real that happened to me
[55:16] it was real it was absolutely was god
[55:18] doing something
[55:19] right you've got to realize it's not how
[55:21] you feel it's what you believe
[55:24] hallelujah so you know jesus never ever
[55:27] said to anyone who who he prayed for or
[55:29] cast out the devil whatever
[55:31] do you feel it he didn't say only feel
[55:33] it he said i only believe
[55:36] right and the same thing with brother
[55:37] brown he says do you believe you didn't
[55:38] say do you feel it do you believe
[55:40] that's how i believe so it's
[55:42] irrespective of how we feel
[55:44] it's what we believe even in hebrews 11
[55:49] when when the apostle paul would come
[55:51] down and speak of the heroes of faith he
[55:53] would say they were stoned
[55:55] they were sawn asunder now this is not
[55:56] in there i don't think
[55:58] they were tempted they were slain with
[55:59] the sword they wandered about now wait
[56:02] this
[56:02] so so this is the modern day translation
[56:05] they wandered about
[56:06] everything was fine they rejoiced they
[56:08] were happy
[56:09] nothing went bad they had lots of money
[56:11] everything just went well
[56:13] uh hold on now they wandered about in
[56:15] sheepskins and goats
[56:16] skins being destitute afflicted
[56:20] tormented of whom the world was not
[56:22] worthy they wandered about in deserts
[56:24] and mountains and dens
[56:26] and caves of the earth this is how they
[56:29] were and and
[56:30] and the law so it's not the apostle paul
[56:32] saying this comment this is god saying
[56:34] this world is not worthy of those people
[56:36] that's how great they are in my sight
[56:39] so it's not how we feel it's what we
[56:41] believe
[56:42] we'll have good days sure we'll have bad
[56:44] days sure we'll have the in-between days
[56:45] sure
[56:46] there'll be days when we don't feel
[56:47] nothing sure
[56:49] hallelujah but we must never ride on our
[56:52] feelings right on our faith
[56:54] hallelujah right on the revelation you
[56:56] have received
[56:58] amen so that's how it means to be that's
[57:00] why i say yo
[57:01] to be strong be constant amen be
[57:04] established
[57:06] now to be courageous now this word
[57:08] courageous has has many different
[57:10] uh definitions there in the hebrew this
[57:12] has to be
[57:13] but but i just grabbed a few to be
[57:16] steadfastly minded
[57:18] my mind doesn't change i've my mind's
[57:21] i've got my mind made up
[57:23] and i won't turn back because i'm going
[57:25] to see my jesus someday
[57:26] goodbye world i'll stay no longer with
[57:29] you goodbye pleasures of sin i'll stay
[57:31] no longer with you i've made up your
[57:32] mind i made up my mind to go god's way
[57:34] the rest of my life
[57:36] hallelujah that's what it means to be
[57:39] steadfastly minded
[57:40] or what's the crowd doing i don't know
[57:42] i'm going that way
[57:44] where's this word taking me what's going
[57:45] to take me in a rapture that sounds like
[57:47] a good deal
[57:49] hallelujah it means to prevail it means
[57:52] to be courageous
[57:54] hallelujah now we're living in an hour
[57:58] where there's to be a bride's revival
[58:01] now we know the bride's revival will not
[58:03] be a nationwide revival
[58:05] like the welsh revival or even even the
[58:07] great healing revival that went through
[58:09] i mean in the in the earlier part of the
[58:12] 20th or 21st century
[58:14] you know whichever one that is you know
[58:17] post world war ii healing revival are
[58:19] you all with me
[58:21] yep so it won't be like that but the
[58:23] bride's revival will be an individual
[58:25] revival
[58:26] i mean but of course we know as the
[58:27] bride gathers together it will be a
[58:28] collective revival in that sense
[58:30] i mean but we are but we every
[58:33] generation
[58:34] must have its own revival and this is
[58:37] this is what i want to tie in with with
[58:39] having you know increased with goods
[58:40] have need of nothing
[58:42] in other words we have enough amen we
[58:44] can't
[58:45] ever let that spirit get on us right
[58:48] we can't ever let a spirit come on as
[58:50] well i met the lord therefore my peer um
[58:52] my children is going to write in my on
[58:54] my coattails
[58:56] oh they say the right things they dress
[58:57] the right way they maybe point out all
[58:59] the wrong things that don't mean they're
[59:00] believers
[59:01] right they've got to meet god the same
[59:02] way you meet god exactly the same god
[59:05] i mean so every generation must have
[59:07] their own revival
[59:08] what does a revival produce the power of
[59:11] god to change your life
[59:13] i mean where the word is put on flesh in
[59:14] that individual and they see a god of
[59:16] power
[59:17] i mean not just a god of forgiveness a
[59:19] god of power i mean to overcome every
[59:22] devil that comes against him i mean
[59:23] that's a revival when you see a
[59:25] supernatural god come and live in you
[59:27] i mean that's a revival because you're
[59:29] awakened to realize i'm a son of god i'm
[59:31] a daughter of god
[59:32] other that's why my father fights for me
[59:35] that's why he lives in my life i mean so
[59:38] every generation
[59:40] must have its own revival and i haven't
[59:43] even speak i'm not even
[59:44] young people necessarily only asking us
[59:47] it's been 50 odd years since the prophet
[59:49] was here this is a new crop
[59:51] i mean we're a new generation every
[59:54] generation must have its own revival
[59:57] it's wonderful what he did in our
[59:58] grandparents day but that's
[59:59] grandparent's day
[1:00:00] it's wonderful what he did in our
[1:00:01] parents day that's parents day what
[1:00:02] about today
[1:00:04] i mean what about today this is oh god
[1:00:06] break out in this place
[1:00:08] hallelujah may we just all get filled
[1:00:10] with the holy ghost
[1:00:11] like never before every generation
[1:00:15] our children we owe it to them
[1:00:20] for them to have a revival amen they
[1:00:23] deserve it
[1:00:24] they deserve god to live in their lives
[1:00:26] doesn't matter what age they are they
[1:00:28] deserve
[1:00:28] them to become a powerhouse of god
[1:00:32] amen now this isn't the message faith i
[1:00:34] don't know how i don't have the um
[1:00:38] no not that one um i don't have
[1:00:41] everything here there anyway
[1:00:42] um this is in the message faith so i
[1:00:44] don't have the year it was preached but
[1:00:46] it was preached when brother brown was a
[1:00:47] prophet
[1:00:48] amen as as brother danny said you know
[1:00:51] and and i think that stan's quoting you
[1:00:54] know people say was it before the seals
[1:00:55] was after seals during the seals
[1:00:57] it was when he was a prophet so anyway
[1:00:59] now so
[1:01:00] he says i'm the lord that heals all my
[1:01:02] diseases look to me all the ends of the
[1:01:04] earth and be healed amen he was wounded
[1:01:06] for our transgressions
[1:01:08] and with his stripes we were healed see
[1:01:10] god promised that jesus said the things
[1:01:12] that
[1:01:12] i do shall you do also i'll make myself
[1:01:16] known to
[1:01:16] every generation to the end of the world
[1:01:19] i'll be with you
[1:01:20] even in you i mean the same things that
[1:01:23] i do you
[1:01:24] do also more than this because the
[1:01:26] revival is all the way around the world
[1:01:28] right now
[1:01:29] i mean the fire is burning on every hill
[1:01:32] hallelujah amen but i
[1:01:35] i believe there's more more of a revival
[1:01:37] to have you see i'm having a glorious
[1:01:39] time the words incredible
[1:01:40] there's more to have there's more to
[1:01:42] have than what we currently have
[1:01:45] hallelujah i'm not saying we don't have
[1:01:46] anything but i'm saying there's more to
[1:01:48] have
[1:01:49] and there's far more than we can even
[1:01:51] fathom
[1:01:52] hallelujah so i think we should just
[1:01:54] take our restrictions of our mind away
[1:01:56] and say lord what do you want to do how
[1:01:58] do you want to live
[1:01:59] come and live that way whatever you want
[1:02:01] to do come and do it
[1:02:02] you live how you want to live you
[1:02:04] manifest your word of my life how you
[1:02:05] want to do it yes
[1:02:07] hallelujah that's hell have your way oh
[1:02:08] god amen brother brown would say in the
[1:02:10] spoken word is the original seed he says
[1:02:12] now you can see the church right there
[1:02:14] where it'll wind up it dies there it
[1:02:16] cannot bring forth
[1:02:17] of its kind why it's mixed uh you've
[1:02:21] you can't do nothing with it he's
[1:02:22] speaking about denomination coming forth
[1:02:24] it's dead it's finished
[1:02:26] is it there oh good it's finished all
[1:02:29] right that's why
[1:02:30] every generation has its own revival a
[1:02:32] chance
[1:02:33] at the word amen so now let's just stop
[1:02:36] there what does it mean to have a chance
[1:02:38] at the word here's the word
[1:02:40] he is a person he's more than an income
[1:02:43] paper he's more than a
[1:02:44] he's more than a prophet's voice on a
[1:02:46] tape he is the almighty god so every
[1:02:48] generation has its chance at the
[1:02:50] for the word at the word to live in them
[1:02:53] and every generation
[1:02:54] must have its own revival so the
[1:02:56] sovereign god
[1:02:58] at the judgment john wesley's group will
[1:03:00] raise up and the starch wash
[1:03:02] methodists of today will answer for it
[1:03:04] luther willa
[1:03:05] will will raise up the catholics will
[1:03:07] raise up and behind
[1:03:08] irenaeus martin polycarp and those that
[1:03:11] will have to stand the judgment for
[1:03:13] hybriding the word of god to dogmas
[1:03:16] this group of lutherans that followed
[1:03:17] luther's revival will answer the same
[1:03:19] thing the group of baptists that
[1:03:20] followed john smith's revival will do
[1:03:22] the same thing
[1:03:23] alexander campbell will do the same
[1:03:25] thing and the pentecostals will do the
[1:03:26] same thing
[1:03:27] that original revival when the holy
[1:03:29] ghost fell i'll say message people do
[1:03:30] the same thing too
[1:03:33] well brother and said but the message
[1:03:34] can't denominate but in some people's
[1:03:36] lives it will
[1:03:37] and it has we don't want to become a
[1:03:39] denomination in ourselves
[1:03:42] how do you do that i've got it all
[1:03:43] worked out a full stop behind it and
[1:03:45] this is how it is
[1:03:47] no no there's more of god there's more
[1:03:49] of god to have
[1:03:50] amen there's more of god to receive have
[1:03:52] the book has come open there's no
[1:03:54] plateau of our christian walk
[1:03:56] there is no plateau luther could plateau
[1:03:58] the joshua lived by faith it's like a
[1:03:59] ceiling he
[1:04:00] went into a ceiling and then the ceiling
[1:04:02] was lifted but higher wesley came
[1:04:04] i mean with sanctification that's as
[1:04:06] high as he could go azusa street
[1:04:08] pentecost the gifts were stored that's
[1:04:09] as
[1:04:09] they were higher than the lutheran
[1:04:11] that's as high as they could go but now
[1:04:12] the word itself has become manifested
[1:04:14] again
[1:04:15] the whole book has come open he himself
[1:04:17] is in the church like he was the day of
[1:04:19] pentecost
[1:04:20] there's no lid to that amen
[1:04:24] there's no lid we can't so what are you
[1:04:27] saying
[1:04:28] there's always more well how do you know
[1:04:30] you've got everything
[1:04:31] or you know everything that god has for
[1:04:33] you either one he takes you
[1:04:35] the dead in christ so so you'll die in
[1:04:37] christ
[1:04:38] or your body will be changed and you go
[1:04:40] to meet with them to meet the lord in
[1:04:42] the air
[1:04:43] that's how you know you've received it
[1:04:44] all for you hallelujah so
[1:04:47] until that time lord i want more of you
[1:04:49] i want to see you live more i want you
[1:04:51] lord may your word become more alive in
[1:04:53] my life
[1:04:55] amen hallelujah called out a people and
[1:04:58] god trying to get his word to it they
[1:05:00] organized set over there denominated
[1:05:01] died right there
[1:05:02] you say but look at what they're doing
[1:05:04] we'll get to that later on today they're
[1:05:06] coming right on down i'm just putting
[1:05:08] the seed in now
[1:05:09] now then we're going to show you after a
[1:05:11] while what happened
[1:05:13] now that's why each revival has its own
[1:05:15] each generation has its own revival
[1:05:17] god raises him up a man sets him with
[1:05:19] the word and starts him out for the
[1:05:21] message
[1:05:22] of that age now and as soon as that
[1:05:25] man's taken off the scene somebody else
[1:05:27] catches it hybrids it and it all falls
[1:05:29] back
[1:05:30] but what if what if someone i'll just
[1:05:31] i'll just turn this the other way
[1:05:34] what if god sends a man to the earth
[1:05:36] with his message
[1:05:37] right for the age and then as soon as
[1:05:40] that man is taken off the scene a people
[1:05:42] take that same word
[1:05:43] keep it in the same purity and run with
[1:05:46] it
[1:05:47] instead of a cycle of revival and death
[1:05:49] is just revival in the next generation
[1:05:51] revival next generation revival
[1:05:53] right that that are things that even
[1:05:55] maybe a founder looked at seeing coming
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:58] the next generation doesn't just see it
[1:06:00] coming sees it live
[1:06:02] hallelujah so and i believe i'm looking
[1:06:05] at a people
[1:06:06] they will not just take the word and
[1:06:07] hybrid by their own ideas but they'll
[1:06:09] keep it pure
[1:06:10] and i'll run with it hallelujah
[1:06:14] but each generation must have its own
[1:06:16] revival
[1:06:17] now can we
[1:06:20] now this is brother brown speaking from
[1:06:22] from our our church age now
[1:06:24] a lot of what i'm going to say from now
[1:06:26] on will be from the latest and church
[1:06:27] age in the church book
[1:06:29] you should go read the chapter it is
[1:06:31] very very powerful
[1:06:33] no actually let's just i'm just going to
[1:06:36] jump
[1:06:36] i'll come back now we have to
[1:06:40] let's go here as i said last sunday
[1:06:44] or last wednesday sunday i you know i
[1:06:47] i i raised the question are we preparing
[1:06:50] our children for the road or are we just
[1:06:52] preparing the road for the children
[1:06:54] now to prepare the children for the
[1:06:56] riders they can actually go become
[1:06:58] adults go into this world yet not be
[1:07:01] tied up with anything and walk with the
[1:07:02] lord
[1:07:03] right or we can prepare the road for the
[1:07:05] children that means we remove
[1:07:07] all obstacles that nothing in the world
[1:07:09] comes in their lives at all for as long
[1:07:11] as possible
[1:07:12] now to me now now this book streams one
[1:07:15] you just let the children do what you
[1:07:16] want the other one you basically
[1:07:18] move to siberia and you just have your
[1:07:20] homestead there and you don't see anyone
[1:07:22] ever
[1:07:23] right so there's two now one of them
[1:07:27] now both actually have no faith in them
[1:07:30] right now this this is a zorb has ever
[1:07:33] gone absorbing
[1:07:36] okay yep okay now when i thought of
[1:07:39] basically
[1:07:40] preparing the road for the children
[1:07:42] removing all obstacles
[1:07:43] i thought it's like absorbing you you
[1:07:46] basically
[1:07:47] wrap your child up in a zorb so nothing
[1:07:49] can get in and you push him down the
[1:07:51] hill of life and say
[1:07:52] i hope he gets to the bottom i believe
[1:07:54] he will because i've repeat the road
[1:07:55] nothing can get in nothing and get out
[1:07:59] now this one's this is actually a car in
[1:08:01] here it's got safety shield technology
[1:08:04] it's a car and a zorb
[1:08:07] now this is man's ability to protect
[1:08:10] something
[1:08:11] and it can be the same thing with i'm
[1:08:13] just going to give the two extremes
[1:08:14] okay now this is man's ability to
[1:08:18] protect their children
[1:08:19] we're to keep going to prepare the road
[1:08:21] may they have no trouble
[1:08:23] may they have no made no demon powers
[1:08:25] come near them we're going to keep them
[1:08:27] isolated because we love him and and
[1:08:29] we're just going to apply the token and
[1:08:31] but then what happens when the car gets
[1:08:33] out of the zorb
[1:08:35] it's going to go on the road it's never
[1:08:37] seen a road before maybe it's hurt
[1:08:39] sun roads are bad keep off the road son
[1:08:44] there's other cars out there they're
[1:08:45] scary
[1:08:47] it'll get hit by another car doesn't
[1:08:49] know how to maneuver defensive driving
[1:08:52] course you don't need one if you're
[1:08:54] absorbed
[1:08:58] to me that is human a human safety
[1:09:00] shield
[1:09:02] and our human even though it's good
[1:09:03] intentions good intentions without the
[1:09:06] holy ghost actually doing it is just
[1:09:08] human effort
[1:09:09] and you're making a denomination of your
[1:09:11] children but then
[1:09:12] but they're the same token if we don't
[1:09:16] if we just let them go out there without
[1:09:17] any kind of you know
[1:09:19] you know brother bram said be the buddy
[1:09:22] be there buddy yeah so they can talk to
[1:09:25] you and you can talk to them
[1:09:27] and it's not daddy today i see a fire in
[1:09:29] school and you just jump up and down and
[1:09:31] you know
[1:09:32] they can actually tell you what's going
[1:09:34] on here
[1:09:35] and you can actually come down to their
[1:09:37] level you know
[1:09:39] jesus jesus was the uh i don't like
[1:09:42] slides because i jump around but
[1:09:43] you know mary and joseph went to have
[1:09:46] winter
[1:09:47] a revival in jerusalem they left you
[1:09:50] they presumed that he was with him when
[1:09:52] they went home
[1:09:53] and many parents in a christian walk are
[1:09:55] having a glorious time
[1:09:57] and they forget their children they
[1:09:59] leave their children somewhere they're
[1:10:01] just presuming well they're just with us
[1:10:02] because they're in the same atmosphere
[1:10:04] and the other things are going on
[1:10:05] but they're not actually they're not
[1:10:07] actually bringing their children with
[1:10:08] them
[1:10:09] and what god is doing in their own lives
[1:10:12] but there's no
[1:10:12] fellowship in the word right to actually
[1:10:15] just sit down and talk
[1:10:16] to them and they presume well our kids
[1:10:18] are with us and they're not with them at
[1:10:20] all
[1:10:20] they can on the outwa i would be looking
[1:10:22] like with them but they're not
[1:10:25] right and then many times you know we
[1:10:27] should not talk at our children we
[1:10:29] should talk with them
[1:10:30] amen there's a big difference between
[1:10:32] talking at them or just preaching at
[1:10:33] them
[1:10:34] you've got to talk to them with them not
[1:10:36] at them
[1:10:38] okay now this this is an article from
[1:10:40] last year
[1:10:42] he jumped off the golden gate bridge
[1:10:43] this man did and survived
[1:10:45] now he's seeing his wish for a safety
[1:10:47] net to come true this is on cnn
[1:10:49] now i don't know if you can read this
[1:10:50] but this is the first word of the
[1:10:51] article jump
[1:10:53] that's the word kevin hinn's heard in
[1:10:56] his her
[1:10:57] head on september 25 year 2000 as he
[1:11:00] stood on the golden gate bridge
[1:11:02] in the midst of a struggle with mental
[1:11:04] illness hens
[1:11:05] got a running start and left over the
[1:11:07] rail
[1:11:08] i'm falling head first and immediately
[1:11:10] recognized that if i hit hit first i
[1:11:12] will die he said recently
[1:11:16] um hinz had deficient bipolar disorder
[1:11:19] and
[1:11:20] came to the bridge because he thought it
[1:11:21] would be the easiest way to die
[1:11:23] as soon as he cleared the railing
[1:11:25] however a new feeling came over him
[1:11:27] regret so what is this
[1:11:30] what is this who's saying jump now
[1:11:33] remember
[1:11:34] we have to prepare for a road
[1:11:37] if you don't know what's talking to you
[1:11:39] and motivating you
[1:11:41] and that devil actually succeeded in him
[1:11:44] getting to jump
[1:11:45] but as soon as he jumped while the devil
[1:11:47] said well my work is done and he leaves
[1:11:49] him
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] we have to prepare our children
[1:11:57] we're not exempt from this they're not
[1:11:58] exempt from this
[1:12:00] why do things like this happen because
[1:12:02] of issues
[1:12:03] because of pain because of hurt because
[1:12:06] of misunderstanding
[1:12:09] if you keep pouring into your children
[1:12:11] that no one likes them and they're
[1:12:12] misunderstood and
[1:12:13] whatever they'll they'll they'll just
[1:12:15] generate a complex
[1:12:17] no one likes me no one's my friend no
[1:12:19] one will play with me this one this one
[1:12:20] this one
[1:12:21] and what happens jump
[1:12:24] think about it now this is probably not
[1:12:27] where you thought this would go today
[1:12:28] but here we are
[1:12:32] that's why we have to talk with our
[1:12:34] children
[1:12:36] remember if you have the holy ghost in
[1:12:38] your life you have the key to
[1:12:40] i don't i pray no one's like this
[1:12:43] here but if you are there is someone
[1:12:46] standing present
[1:12:48] that can actually get that out of your
[1:12:50] head
[1:12:52] that you won't jump you say satan get
[1:12:54] out of my life
[1:12:56] you're a murderer from the beginning
[1:12:58] you're still a murderer today you can't
[1:12:59] take my life
[1:13:00] how do you try and make me jump
[1:13:04] thankfully this man survived i thought
[1:13:06] praise the lord
[1:13:07] and now he's got safety nets under the
[1:13:11] bridge so when people
[1:13:12] when when that same voice says jump
[1:13:14] there's a net to catch them
[1:13:16] there's a net more than a physical net
[1:13:19] there's a gospel net do you think our
[1:13:22] lord jesus likes anyone dying
[1:13:25] god is the author of life life is sacred
[1:13:28] to him brother baby said it's all
[1:13:29] written in a book
[1:13:30] it's life is sacred to god it doesn't
[1:13:32] matter whose life it is it's still
[1:13:34] sacred
[1:13:34] he's the author of it
[1:13:37] so we have to be able to i'm just going
[1:13:39] to leave that there but we have to
[1:13:41] prepare our children
[1:13:43] it's all down to relationship not
[1:13:45] beating down on them
[1:13:47] talking with them i mean because many
[1:13:50] times they start talking about stuff
[1:13:51] they don't know what's going on and
[1:13:53] first five seconds or maybe five minutes
[1:13:55] of the conversation you don't know
[1:13:56] what's going on
[1:13:58] say lord we need discernment amen that
[1:14:01] we can prepare them
[1:14:02] and this is older ones as well he was an
[1:14:04] adult he wasn't a little child
[1:14:08] but we have a key that can release
[1:14:11] people
[1:14:16] he said well no one understands what i'm
[1:14:18] going through jesus does
[1:14:21] the lord understands what's going on in
[1:14:22] your life and your parents want to
[1:14:24] understand what's going on in your life
[1:14:27] and we all want to understand if you you
[1:14:29] know
[1:14:30] you know parents try their best i'm i'm
[1:14:33] one so i'll stick up for them
[1:14:35] we try our best we're limited we are
[1:14:37] sure we are but we try our best
[1:14:40] amens we're trying so now what's that
[1:14:43] got to do with this age
[1:14:47] in this age of plenty in this age of
[1:14:50] progress
[1:14:51] in this age of abundance how can there
[1:14:53] be trials well now it is strange but in
[1:14:55] this age of plenty and opportunity
[1:14:57] when everyone has so much and there is
[1:15:00] so much more to be had
[1:15:02] what with all the inventions to do our
[1:15:04] work and so many things to give us
[1:15:06] pleasure
[1:15:07] suddenly now that was in in in capitals
[1:15:11] in the church book that's not me
[1:15:12] we find mental illness taking such a
[1:15:14] toll as to alarm the nation
[1:15:17] where everybody ought to be happy with
[1:15:20] really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:15:23] we have really have nothing to be
[1:15:24] unhappy about can we eat yes can we have
[1:15:27] clothing yes can we have shelter yes
[1:15:29] can we live in a free country yes
[1:15:33] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:15:35] millions of taking sedatives at night
[1:15:37] pet pills in the morning rushing to
[1:15:38] doctors
[1:15:39] entering into institutions and trying to
[1:15:42] drown out
[1:15:43] unknown fears by alcohol and you can
[1:15:44] just replace it with alcohol by any kind
[1:15:46] of drug
[1:15:49] yet this age boasts of its tremendous
[1:15:51] stores
[1:15:52] so already here stores of worldly goods
[1:15:55] but the people are less happy than ever
[1:15:58] this age boasts of its spiritual
[1:16:00] attainments but the people
[1:16:01] are less sure of themselves than ever
[1:16:05] this age boasts of better moral values
[1:16:07] and it is more
[1:16:09] um and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:16:11] since
[1:16:12] the flood we think we have ethically we
[1:16:16] have arrived
[1:16:20] we have science we have knowledge we
[1:16:22] have psychiatry
[1:16:23] you know all those things so we so this
[1:16:27] we think we're better morals than ever
[1:16:29] but it's more corrupt than
[1:16:31] any other agents of flood it talks about
[1:16:33] its knowledge in science but it is
[1:16:35] fighting a losing battle on all fields
[1:16:37] for the human mind and soul and spirit
[1:16:39] cannot comprehend or keep abreast with
[1:16:41] all the changes that have come upon the
[1:16:43] earth
[1:16:43] in one generation we have gone all the
[1:16:45] way from the horse and buggy to the
[1:16:47] space age
[1:16:48] and we are proud and boastful about it
[1:16:51] now
[1:16:51] when i was little in the old days we had
[1:16:54] no internet
[1:16:56] youtube wasn't a thing instagram wasn't
[1:16:59] a thing
[1:17:00] digital cameras weren't a thing
[1:17:02] smartphones
[1:17:05] no they weren't a thing
[1:17:08] so even even even in our generation
[1:17:11] we've gone from a landline or maybe a
[1:17:13] brick phone
[1:17:15] to augmented reality it's a digital age
[1:17:18] hyper
[1:17:19] connectivity you know but yet people are
[1:17:22] more alone
[1:17:24] they feel more isolated they actually
[1:17:26] connect less on a meaningful level
[1:17:28] because of all those things i'm i'm
[1:17:30] connected with heaps of people i put a
[1:17:32] something on social media i get like 100
[1:17:34] odd likes or love hearts or whatever
[1:17:37] but you're not actually connected with
[1:17:39] those people in a meaningful way
[1:17:42] what is it now boastful about it but
[1:17:46] inside is a dark
[1:17:48] void cavern that is crying out in
[1:17:50] torment and without a known reason
[1:17:52] men's hearts are failing for fear
[1:17:55] you know it's incredible to me when when
[1:17:58] someone and they are serious they
[1:18:00] likened the covert lockdown in this
[1:18:03] country
[1:18:04] as to being in world war ii and they
[1:18:07] were serious
[1:18:08] they put that on par world war ii
[1:18:11] with a covert lockdown
[1:18:14] men's hearts failing for fear they said
[1:18:17] we're struggling this is just as bad as
[1:18:19] what europe and the rest of the world
[1:18:21] when you know when those walls are
[1:18:22] fought
[1:18:23] no it ain't no it ain't
[1:18:26] it's not even there sitting in a house
[1:18:30] people complaining about being in in
[1:18:32] enforced
[1:18:33] quarantine when they come into the
[1:18:34] country and they have wi-fi and they
[1:18:36] have food and they've got they're in a
[1:18:37] nice hotel and
[1:18:39] you know but everyone's worried about
[1:18:40] their mental health why what's happened
[1:18:43] something's happened in this age
[1:18:45] something's happened
[1:18:47] this is the road that we have to tread
[1:18:50] all of us yes we're not exempt from this
[1:18:53] thing
[1:18:54] and without known reason means hearts
[1:18:56] are failing for fear and the world is so
[1:18:58] darkened in this age yet
[1:19:00] could well be called the age of
[1:19:01] neurotics it boasts but it cannot back
[1:19:03] it up it cries peace there's no peace
[1:19:05] it cries that it has a great um
[1:19:08] amplitude of all things
[1:19:10] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[1:19:13] unsatisfied fire
[1:19:14] there is no peace saith my god to the
[1:19:17] wicked now that's scripture there
[1:19:20] so sadly this man jumped off the bridge
[1:19:23] so people are less happy than they've
[1:19:24] ever been
[1:19:26] mental illness is is is upon the earth
[1:19:28] like it's never been before
[1:19:30] and this is the world we must prepare to
[1:19:33] live in and whether you like it or not
[1:19:34] you say i didn't sign up to live in this
[1:19:36] age well god signed you up
[1:19:38] well that's not fair no it is fair
[1:19:40] because god has equipped you
[1:19:41] amen with his own self i mean to
[1:19:44] overcome this age hallelujah
[1:19:46] he did not throw he didn't he didn't
[1:19:48] just see this is not i used to call it
[1:19:50] latin not they ever played rugby or
[1:19:52] touch but it's like you know someone
[1:19:53] kicks a defensive bomb in the 20
[1:19:55] you know and the 22. inside your own 22
[1:19:57] you kick a defensive bomb
[1:19:59] then someone's got to catch that and try
[1:20:00] and win the game god don't do that
[1:20:02] god didn't throw us a hospital pass you
[1:20:05] know by by
[1:20:06] by putting you in this age he didn't
[1:20:09] god's equipped us i mean to overcome in
[1:20:13] this age
[1:20:14] every demon power every trouble we have
[1:20:17] given we have been given the ability
[1:20:19] we have been enabled to do it i mean to
[1:20:22] overcome in this age
[1:20:24] hallelujah oh
[1:20:27] we're not happy about that okay that's
[1:20:28] fine well oh boy tough crowd oh boy
[1:20:33] oh boy anywho you know
[1:20:36] we now brother branham would speak about
[1:20:39] so
[1:20:39] let's not zorb our children let's not
[1:20:42] just throw them to the dogs
[1:20:44] let's be their buddies they need a guide
[1:20:47] brother ram says in leadership you know
[1:20:49] mother gets them first then the school
[1:20:51] team or dad then the school teaches in
[1:20:53] the minister but now who leads them
[1:20:55] and we know all those things overlap but
[1:20:58] there'll come a day
[1:21:00] where my girls are not girls anymore but
[1:21:02] they're fully grown woman
[1:21:04] and my boys are fully grown man and they
[1:21:06] want to
[1:21:08] you know have a career before they get
[1:21:10] married or whatever
[1:21:11] you know i can't keep them in a zorb
[1:21:15] i'm not trying to keep them in his orb
[1:21:18] does that mean we just throw them out
[1:21:19] there whatever comes comes no no you
[1:21:21] need you need wisdom
[1:21:22] you need real wisdom because the problem
[1:21:25] is
[1:21:26] is a child is born like all of us with a
[1:21:30] fallen nature
[1:21:33] so they want to get out of the zorb and
[1:21:34] get hit by the truck because sin is
[1:21:36] appealing
[1:21:39] i'm glad there's no hallelujah's there
[1:21:41] but you know we were all born that way
[1:21:43] we all had your sinners appealing that's
[1:21:45] why people fall into it
[1:21:47] it's not like it takes it against their
[1:21:48] will actually their will says i want
[1:21:50] this
[1:21:51] because the devil manipulates human
[1:21:53] emotion their bodies everything any
[1:21:55] any twisted against people right
[1:21:59] so you can't put them in a zorb
[1:22:02] even though it may look very good on the
[1:22:03] outside we need holy ghost safety shield
[1:22:08] technology
[1:22:10] now as i said jesus was left behind in
[1:22:14] jerusalem
[1:22:15] by his parents his parents thought they
[1:22:18] were with him he was with them
[1:22:19] he wasn't where are your parents where
[1:22:22] are your children
[1:22:25] parents and i say children where are
[1:22:27] your parents
[1:22:28] spiritually oh they got their own thing
[1:22:31] they got their hobbies well hold on
[1:22:33] what about you what about you
[1:22:37] you know all of us kids here i'll throw
[1:22:40] i'll yeah anyway all the kids here
[1:22:42] deserve the best parents
[1:22:44] they deserve the best mom and dad that
[1:22:45] that god can make they deserve it
[1:22:48] don't they ah our kids and i believe we
[1:22:50] have the best young people in the
[1:22:52] country
[1:22:54] i'm glad someone agrees with me there
[1:22:56] yes just
[1:22:57] brother ed is speaking for everyone on
[1:22:59] behalf i
[1:23:00] i actually believe that i believe we
[1:23:02] have the best we don't have a bunch of
[1:23:04] ragtag
[1:23:05] you know we we have great young people
[1:23:08] amen so we
[1:23:12] see they are supposing him to be in the
[1:23:13] company but they had gone to day's
[1:23:15] journey
[1:23:16] where's he gone left him behind now
[1:23:21] let's go to revelation chapter three
[1:23:24] i'm gonna maybe i'm sorry if this is
[1:23:26] like three sermons in one or something
[1:23:28] but this is just
[1:23:29] you know we start someplace we end up
[1:23:30] another place and then we go home you
[1:23:32] know
[1:23:32] so that's kind of where we are so we
[1:23:35] need to look into the age that we are in
[1:23:37] but many times we are just looking at
[1:23:39] the negative aspect of this age because
[1:23:41] we know that
[1:23:42] the lord did say he didn't say one good
[1:23:44] thing about this age
[1:23:46] you know there was good every age there
[1:23:48] was good and bad
[1:23:50] this last age is just bad
[1:24:05] revelations three
[1:24:09] now let's go from verse 14.
[1:24:15] and unto the age angel of the church of
[1:24:17] the later sians
[1:24:19] write these things saith the amen the
[1:24:21] faithful and true witness
[1:24:22] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:24:25] now we're just going to stay right there
[1:24:28] now here is
[1:24:28] now we know in every church age the lord
[1:24:31] reveals a part of his deity
[1:24:34] right and every age now on this this age
[1:24:37] he is declaring that he is the amen
[1:24:39] which is the final saying
[1:24:40] it means so be it here's the amen he is
[1:24:43] the faithful
[1:24:44] and the true witness and the beginning
[1:24:47] of the creation of god
[1:24:49] now in order to be the beginning of it
[1:24:53] now i
[1:24:54] just want to break down a bit of this
[1:24:55] now he says now
[1:24:58] as he's standing in his church in this
[1:25:00] last day brother bam says my this is
[1:25:02] speaking about the
[1:25:02] beginning of the creation of god the
[1:25:04] faithful and true witness the amen
[1:25:06] my isn't it the most wonderful
[1:25:07] description of the attributes of our
[1:25:09] lovely
[1:25:09] lord and savior jesus christ these words
[1:25:12] just make me want to shout they bring
[1:25:15] such a spirit of reality into my heart
[1:25:17] just reading them without even waiting
[1:25:19] for a thorough revelation of the spirit
[1:25:20] upon them thrills me
[1:25:22] i'm glad he's the amen the amen is the
[1:25:24] final say
[1:25:26] amen our lord gets the final say in this
[1:25:28] age not the devil
[1:25:29] none of us works remember god is not
[1:25:31] some distant god
[1:25:33] he is currently working and i'll read
[1:25:34] the quote but he is currently working in
[1:25:36] the lives of men
[1:25:38] he's active in your life whether you see
[1:25:40] him or not he is active working in the
[1:25:42] lives of men in this hour
[1:25:44] hallelujah hallelujah i mean jesus is
[1:25:47] giving us the description of himself in
[1:25:49] relation to the last age
[1:25:50] the days of grace are winding up he has
[1:25:53] looked from the first century right
[1:25:55] through to the 20th
[1:25:56] and told us all things concerning these
[1:25:58] ages
[1:25:59] before he reveals the characteristics of
[1:26:02] the last h to us
[1:26:03] he gives us one final look at his own
[1:26:06] glorious and supreme deity
[1:26:08] this is the capstone revelation of
[1:26:11] himself
[1:26:12] what is that capstone revelation of
[1:26:14] himself the amen
[1:26:16] the faithful and true witness the
[1:26:19] beginning of the creation of god
[1:26:20] now thus saith the amen jesus is the
[1:26:23] amen this is all from the church age
[1:26:25] book if you're wondering when brother
[1:26:26] brown was a prophet and it was william
[1:26:27] branagh's book not levail's book
[1:26:29] okay so jesus is the amen of god jesus
[1:26:32] is the so beard of god amen stands for
[1:26:35] finality
[1:26:36] it stands for approval it stands for a
[1:26:38] prevailing promise
[1:26:39] it stands for unchanging promise that
[1:26:42] stands for the seal of god that's just
[1:26:43] that word amen he's the amen
[1:26:45] amen so he is he stands for prevailing
[1:26:48] promise what's the prevailing promise
[1:26:50] in this day there's a people going to
[1:26:51] escape they're going to go on a rapture
[1:26:53] they're going to escape the wrath that's
[1:26:55] going to come upon the earth
[1:26:56] that's a promise and it will prevail i
[1:26:58] mean it stands for approval who does he
[1:27:00] approve of his bride
[1:27:04] it stands for finality amen what's that
[1:27:06] finality there's a people
[1:27:07] not going to see death they're going to
[1:27:08] go on a body change hallelujah
[1:27:11] amen these things saith the faithful and
[1:27:14] true witness now i want to show you
[1:27:16] uh what i find in the thought of
[1:27:18] faithful
[1:27:19] you know we often talk about a great
[1:27:21] unchanging god whose word does not
[1:27:24] change
[1:27:24] and when we speak of him after that
[1:27:26] manner we often get a view of him that
[1:27:28] makes him seem very impersonal
[1:27:31] amen because he doesn't change it is as
[1:27:34] though god made the whole universe and
[1:27:36] all the laws that pertain to it
[1:27:37] then he stood back and became a great
[1:27:39] and personal god
[1:27:41] it is as though god made a way of
[1:27:42] salvation for lost mankind
[1:27:44] that way being the cross and then when
[1:27:47] the death of christ had atoned for our
[1:27:49] sins
[1:27:49] and his resurrection gave us an open
[1:27:51] door to him god just folded his
[1:27:54] arms and stood back it is this we are it
[1:27:57] it is as if we majored on believing in a
[1:28:01] great creator god
[1:28:02] who having created lost personal
[1:28:05] interest in his creation now i say
[1:28:08] this is how this is how too many people
[1:28:11] are apt
[1:28:12] to think and i fear that's many times
[1:28:15] how we think
[1:28:16] he was here in the prophet's life he did
[1:28:19] something here for me once but now i
[1:28:20] just don't see him no more he's just
[1:28:22] beyond all things and you know he's not
[1:28:24] interested in me he's interested in us
[1:28:27] he's interested in every single one of
[1:28:29] us i mean and that's just not a partial
[1:28:32] interest he's really interested
[1:28:34] hallelujah i'm glad he's interested in
[1:28:36] me
[1:28:37] and he's not interested in me to throw
[1:28:39] me away he's interested in me to keep me
[1:28:41] he saved me to keep me hallelujah
[1:28:44] he didn't save me to lose me he saved me
[1:28:46] to keep me
[1:28:48] amen but that is wrong
[1:28:51] thinking for god is governing in the
[1:28:53] affairs of men right now he is both
[1:28:55] creator
[1:28:56] and sustainer so there's nothing that's
[1:28:59] going to come upon the earth that's
[1:29:00] going to get one over god
[1:29:03] right amen he is right now governing in
[1:29:06] the affairs of men
[1:29:07] even in this little country on the back
[1:29:08] side of the pacific god is governing in
[1:29:11] the affairs of men
[1:29:12] hallelujah amen says in colossians 1 for
[1:29:15] by him we are we're all things created
[1:29:18] that are in heaven
[1:29:19] and that are on earth visible and
[1:29:21] invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:29:22] dominions or principalities or powers
[1:29:25] all things were created by him and for
[1:29:27] him and he is before all things and by
[1:29:29] him all things consist
[1:29:31] amen he is a sovereign god by his own
[1:29:33] counsel he purposed the plan of
[1:29:35] salvation
[1:29:36] of his own elect that which he foreknew
[1:29:38] the son died upon the cross to establish
[1:29:41] the means of salvation
[1:29:42] and the holy spirit carefully executes
[1:29:45] the will of the father
[1:29:47] hallelujah that's why the holy ghost is
[1:29:49] upon the earth he's carefully
[1:29:50] executing the will of the father what is
[1:29:53] the will of the father i got names in my
[1:29:55] book
[1:29:56] i took a photo of them at their best
[1:29:57] before the foundation the world my
[1:29:59] family album
[1:30:00] and all that are in the family album are
[1:30:02] going to end up on the other side in
[1:30:03] eternity again
[1:30:05] and now my spirit has come upon the
[1:30:06] earth i mean to carefully execute my
[1:30:08] will
[1:30:09] that those ones that in the lamb's book
[1:30:10] of life will end up in eternity
[1:30:13] hallelujah and whosoever will let them
[1:30:15] come
[1:30:16] amen oh i'm so glad what
[1:30:20] sorry he is working all things at this
[1:30:22] moment according to the purpose of his
[1:30:24] own will
[1:30:25] he is right in the midst of it all he's
[1:30:27] in the midst of his church this great
[1:30:29] creator savior god is faithfully
[1:30:31] working amongst his own right now as the
[1:30:34] great shepherd of the sheep his
[1:30:36] his very existence is
[1:30:39] for his own
[1:30:42] can i read that statement just one more
[1:30:44] time his very existence
[1:30:46] is for his own that's why why why is
[1:30:49] there god for you
[1:30:51] his very existence is for you hallelujah
[1:30:55] you give him purpose of being god before
[1:30:58] there ever was anything says i need a
[1:30:59] purpose of being
[1:31:01] and then he thought of a bride he
[1:31:02] thought of a world he's going to put
[1:31:03] them on he thought of the devil that's
[1:31:05] going to be thrown in the lake of fire
[1:31:06] he thought of his adversary he thought
[1:31:08] of how he's going to conquer him
[1:31:09] hallelujah he thought he was going to
[1:31:11] make a people that will love him more
[1:31:12] than anything else
[1:31:13] and he thought now i'm going to express
[1:31:14] them upon the earth why because i want
[1:31:16] to know them i want to love them i want
[1:31:18] to walk with them
[1:31:18] i want to have a relationship with them
[1:31:20] hallelujah and now
[1:31:22] you give him purpose see we think you
[1:31:25] know
[1:31:26] that's the problem of this of this
[1:31:27] modern age we live in people think
[1:31:29] what's the point of living
[1:31:30] there's point the reason you're alive is
[1:31:33] because
[1:31:34] god has a purpose for you being here and
[1:31:36] you are the purpose of heaven
[1:31:38] his very existence is for his own
[1:31:42] hallelujah hallelujah i mean he loves
[1:31:45] him and cares for them his eyes ever
[1:31:47] upon them i'm glad his eyes upon me
[1:31:50] i mean when the word says that your
[1:31:52] lives are hid with christ and god it
[1:31:53] means exactly what it says
[1:31:55] oh i'm so glad that my life my god
[1:31:57] abides faithful
[1:31:59] he is true to himself he won't lie he is
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:02] he is true to the word he will back it
[1:32:04] up amen he is true to us he will lose
[1:32:07] none of us
[1:32:07] but raise us up in the last day i'm glad
[1:32:10] that i'm resting
[1:32:11] in his faithfulness that's why i put
[1:32:13] that in big fonted and red and
[1:32:15] underlined i just love that
[1:32:17] i am glad that i'm resting in his
[1:32:18] faithfulness and that's why brother
[1:32:20] brahm says with every promise of god
[1:32:22] you've got to ask him for it then go
[1:32:23] thanking him for it
[1:32:25] hallelujah that's why you got to say

[1:32:43] faithful you begin to water the promise
[1:32:45] of god lord i thank you your word is
[1:32:46] true
[1:32:47] you know what i love about the book of
[1:32:48] acts yeah i love it i love it in
[1:32:50] in acts chapter 2 where the apostle
[1:32:53] peter is standing there and he's
[1:32:54] preaching the first ever church service
[1:32:56] and he says if you repent and be
[1:32:58] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:32:59] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:33:02] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:33:03] ghost for the promises to you and to
[1:33:05] your children
[1:33:06] that's the first thing he says so to me
[1:33:07] now if i have received the promise of
[1:33:09] the holy ghost
[1:33:10] then lord i'm thanking you lord you'll
[1:33:12] fulfill the next part of that verse
[1:33:14] hallelujah he can't just fulfill part of
[1:33:16] it and leave another part you know god
[1:33:18] doesn't back down on his promise
[1:33:20] god doesn't back down on his word he
[1:33:22] doesn't he doesn't throw a promise out
[1:33:24] to the sons of adam and daughters of
[1:33:26] adam and then say maybe oh
[1:33:27] no it can't be fulfilled and take it
[1:33:29] back god can't take his word back he
[1:33:31] throws it out there says now i'm here to
[1:33:33] back it up
[1:33:34] hallelujah that's what god does he
[1:33:37] wasn't
[1:33:37] you know he never brought in when when
[1:33:39] he told abraham
[1:33:41] you're going to have the promised son he
[1:33:43] didn't say next minute i actually i
[1:33:45] didn't realize you're that old
[1:33:48] didn't mean that didn't mean that no he
[1:33:51] said i mean it
[1:33:53] i mean what i've told you and i'm going
[1:33:54] to fulfill it in your own body
[1:33:56] and sarah's part of you she's part of
[1:33:57] the promise too haley has the same thing
[1:34:00] with our children our family i believe
[1:34:01] amen we're part of the promise they're
[1:34:03] part of the promise
[1:34:04] hallelujah and god doesn't god doesn't
[1:34:06] panic
[1:34:08] you know in our human minds we would
[1:34:10] think if god's going to have a bribe
[1:34:11] without spot or wrinkle and she's going
[1:34:13] to not taste death and you know break
[1:34:14] the cycle of the ages
[1:34:15] we would put them in a kind of age where
[1:34:17] there's really no problems
[1:34:20] we think so yeah yeah make it easy
[1:34:23] make it real easy we know every age had
[1:34:25] a challenge but this age is the worst
[1:34:28] hallelujah but this is the grandest of
[1:34:30] ages this is where
[1:34:31] people won't just like the ephesians aim
[1:34:33] at the high calling in christ then relax
[1:34:35] and go on to death but there's a people
[1:34:37] upon the earth that aim at and become
[1:34:40] why because god annoys them in such a
[1:34:42] way you know the spirit of god will take
[1:34:43] you to your destination
[1:34:46] you know he will take you to your
[1:34:47] destination that's not you gonna take
[1:34:49] it's not our human effort and how much
[1:34:52] sweat and blood and tears we pour into
[1:34:53] it
[1:34:54] that's gonna do it it's not sure however
[1:34:57] it manifests in your life some of us are
[1:34:58] quiet some of us are loud that's fine
[1:35:01] god's not a cookie cutter he doesn't
[1:35:03] make us all the same way
[1:35:05] right so how it manifests will be
[1:35:07] different but the but
[1:35:08] the manifestation of it will be the same
[1:35:11] what does that mean
[1:35:12] you know we can people can shout and
[1:35:14] jump and say lord
[1:35:15] thank you for my children or they can
[1:35:17] say lord thank you for my children
[1:35:19] and if that's a real revelation in their
[1:35:21] hearts they get their children
[1:35:23] right hallelujah
[1:35:26] amen so you know you're the spirit of
[1:35:28] god yeah god doesn't back up on any
[1:35:30] challenge
[1:35:30] he doesn't back up on his word he cannot
[1:35:32] back up on his word he is his word
[1:35:35] right so when he said there'll be an h
[1:35:37] like this h and we're living in this age
[1:35:39] and he predestinated people to that age
[1:35:41] and we're producing to this age
[1:35:43] and those people will overcome all
[1:35:45] things
[1:35:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:50] we will he said it in his word i believe
[1:35:53] i'm part of this word
[1:35:55] the right part of the word hallelujah i
[1:35:57] mean so so if he said that we were going
[1:35:59] to be this way then we're going to be
[1:36:00] this way
[1:36:01] sure we'll have challenges we'll have
[1:36:02] more challenges at this age
[1:36:04] than than any age before why do you say
[1:36:06] that because there's 200 000 000 demons
[1:36:09] released upon this age
[1:36:10] but we know that we are not fighting
[1:36:12] this battle alone
[1:36:14] uh it's time we lift up our heads and
[1:36:16] know that our redemption birth night
[1:36:18] amen because we know when when when hell
[1:36:20] opened up amen revelations night opened
[1:36:22] up but then john said i saw another
[1:36:24] mighty angel come down
[1:36:25] where christ himself came down to the
[1:36:27] earth with an open book
[1:36:29] he said now i'm going to actually push
[1:36:30] down the powers of hell and darkness
[1:36:32] i'm going to gather my sea to myself god
[1:36:35] can't lie
[1:36:36] he can't back up on a promise he can't
[1:36:39] even compromise our promise
[1:36:42] he has no middle ground you know it's
[1:36:44] not a negotiation with him and the devil
[1:36:46] well devil if you give me this then you
[1:36:49] know you know devil i said this but
[1:36:50] you know i need some wriggle room so i
[1:36:52] can do this and can you do this no
[1:36:54] no no no no god says she'll be there
[1:36:58] the devil will be under her feet she
[1:37:01] will be the overcomer of the age
[1:37:04] he doesn't put a bubble around you he
[1:37:06] doesn't put you in his orb
[1:37:08] where the devil can't get in hell yeah
[1:37:11] but he actually puts you on the
[1:37:12] battlefield
[1:37:14] but we know we're not alone on this road
[1:37:17] our god's here too
[1:37:18] amen it's not us trying to get into a
[1:37:20] rapture it's him getting us into a
[1:37:21] rapture
[1:37:22] it's not us trying to save our children
[1:37:24] our own human ability only
[1:37:26] it's god sure we should we've got to
[1:37:27] create an atmosphere
[1:37:29] amen we're going to raise them train
[1:37:30] them up in the right way
[1:37:32] hallelujah but we need wisdom to do it
[1:37:34] we need his anointing to do it because
[1:37:36] sadly many children have been raised the
[1:37:38] right way on the outward but on the
[1:37:39] inward they are not converted they go
[1:37:41] into the world and they never come back
[1:37:43] why because they were raised
[1:37:44] unfortunately the wrong way but we have
[1:37:46] a promise
[1:37:48] we have a promise hallelujah
[1:37:51] we have a promise we all make mistakes
[1:37:55] amen on behalf of everyone in this
[1:37:58] church as an adult we all make mistakes
[1:38:01] just in case you suddenly said amen i'll
[1:38:03] just say amen for you out loud
[1:38:06] we're all human but that's why we need
[1:38:07] the grace of god
[1:38:09] and we needed to depend lord you saved
[1:38:11] me
[1:38:13] and now maybe i came totally out of the
[1:38:15] world i had a guidance i had nothing to
[1:38:17] find me you know nothing to help me
[1:38:19] humanly but you found me
[1:38:21] now you've put me now you've made me a
[1:38:22] steward of my family
[1:38:26] i'm not sure my children are not mine
[1:38:29] hey jesus you're you belong to jesus
[1:38:31] girls but you've been but you've been
[1:38:33] given to me because he loved me that
[1:38:34] much to give you to me
[1:38:35] and i'm here to look after you until you
[1:38:37] go home hallelujah because you belong to
[1:38:40] him you don't belong to me only you
[1:38:41] belong to him most
[1:38:43] so now if that's a responsibility which
[1:38:45] it is now i want to be a wise student
[1:38:47] because i can either break them or make
[1:38:49] them robots or i can raise them the
[1:38:50] right way
[1:38:52] hallelujah amen help us jesus
[1:39:01] god doesn't back up on his word he
[1:39:04] cannot and he will not and he refuses to
[1:39:06] one thing god cannot do is fail holly
[1:39:09] god cannot fail
[1:39:10] he won't fail in this age he cannot fail
[1:39:12] in the sage
[1:39:13] there is gonna be a people that will
[1:39:16] have a bridge revival
[1:39:18] there will be a people i mean where
[1:39:20] everything brothers spoke about it bride
[1:39:21] will be manifested upon the earth
[1:39:23] oh i just gotta wait till i get into
[1:39:25] heaven brother ben and i can really
[1:39:26] praise him
[1:39:27] and live from there no no you're gonna
[1:39:29] do it now i mean because what you are
[1:39:32] there it's because you're already that
[1:39:33] way here
[1:39:35] now how it manifests on the outside guys
[1:39:38] not a cookie cutter but on the inside
[1:39:41] hallelujah so don't try and match with
[1:39:43] someone else match with the word of god
[1:39:45] we can't all be the same and i'm glad
[1:39:47] we're not all the same life would be
[1:39:48] boring
[1:39:49] variety is the spice of life hallelujah
[1:39:53] so no but but what we are there is
[1:39:55] because we are here already
[1:39:57] hallelujah hello
[1:40:01] amen they will kill doesn't matter how
[1:40:03] big how fat how wide how impossible
[1:40:06] you know brother and paul said a couple
[1:40:07] of weeks ago he said when you let god be
[1:40:09] god
[1:40:10] when you let god be god i mean then he
[1:40:13] can step on the scene but when you stop
[1:40:14] him being god he can't be god in your
[1:40:16] life
[1:40:17] how do you try and be how do you stop
[1:40:19] him you try and do it yourself
[1:40:20] you try and control it you try and do it
[1:40:22] in your own human ability
[1:40:23] he he waits saying are you done yet
[1:40:28] are you finished because we get to a
[1:40:31] place say lord this is not working
[1:40:33] and and he he could have told you years
[1:40:35] ago i know
[1:40:37] i've been watching this whole thing this
[1:40:39] is just come on man come on
[1:40:41] tag me in here and when we let god be
[1:40:44] god
[1:40:45] oh i've got to sort this out let god
[1:40:47] sort it out
[1:40:48] let god sort it out let god take care of
[1:40:51] it yes
[1:40:52] hallelujah amen does that mean i sit
[1:40:54] back and do nothing no
[1:40:56] he'll lead you we need wisdom but you've
[1:40:58] got to let god be god
[1:40:59] god's bigger than our problems god's
[1:41:01] bigger than the pressure in the world
[1:41:03] god's bigger than the pressure economic
[1:41:05] pressure sickness pressure whatever
[1:41:07] pressure in the world
[1:41:08] god is bigger than ladies here god is
[1:41:10] far bigger than later
[1:41:12] we don't need to fear nothing he's
[1:41:13] bigger oh but i'm looking down the
[1:41:16] i'm looking down the barrel of a great
[1:41:17] big trial he's bigger than your trial
[1:41:19] he's bigger than the hardship he's
[1:41:21] bigger than the uncertainty just let god
[1:41:23] be god
[1:41:24] if god found you he found you to keep
[1:41:27] you
[1:41:27] right and if he found you he's going to
[1:41:29] take you all the way through
[1:41:30] just don't lose your confidence you know
[1:41:33] what brother brown would do i can't
[1:41:34] remember who i heard saying this but
[1:41:36] your brother brother brown would stand
[1:41:38] there
[1:41:38] and he would give testimonies of what
[1:41:40] had happened in the past
[1:41:42] he'd tell about the mexican baby maybe
[1:41:44] congressman upshaw
[1:41:45] maybe different ones have been
[1:41:46] supernaturally healed what was he doing
[1:41:48] he was now building an atmosphere lord
[1:41:51] you did that
[1:41:53] and now we're facing this but you're the
[1:41:55] same god there as here
[1:41:57] hallelujah and he began to let god be
[1:41:59] god
[1:42:00] god you did it there how did he do it i
[1:42:03] don't know
[1:42:05] i just believe his word amen so whatever
[1:42:08] he did for you in the past
[1:42:09] he will continue in the future if you
[1:42:12] surrender to him there and
[1:42:14] and he overcame your problem there
[1:42:16] surrender to him here he'll overcome
[1:42:17] your problem here
[1:42:19] hallelujah didn't he call us out didn't
[1:42:22] he find
[1:42:22] us wherever we were we we may have been
[1:42:25] raised in a church but one day he
[1:42:26] quickened us to his word
[1:42:28] or we came out of the world and one day
[1:42:30] he quickened us to his word
[1:42:31] hallelujah he brought us out he found us
[1:42:34] he turned our heart
[1:42:35] you know marvel the scripture says that
[1:42:37] there's not one that seeks after god
[1:42:40] and that's not i'm not and and sometimes
[1:42:42] maybe i just used to read that well
[1:42:43] that's just the people in the world no
[1:42:45] that's every single human being every
[1:42:48] everyone
[1:42:49] not one man seeks after god the apostle
[1:42:51] paul said and that's actually god saying
[1:42:53] you know no one seeks after me
[1:42:57] well then how on earth do people start
[1:42:59] seeking after him then
[1:43:01] when you let god be god he can turn a
[1:43:05] heart
[1:43:06] that's made up their mind i'm going this
[1:43:08] way hey the apostle paul made up his
[1:43:10] mind
[1:43:10] i'm gonna wipe this out i'm gonna stop
[1:43:13] these fanatics these holy rollers
[1:43:14] shouting bunch of tongue speaking crazy
[1:43:16] people
[1:43:17] i'm gonna deal with them i'm gonna shut
[1:43:19] this up these bunch of heretics he made
[1:43:21] up his mind
[1:43:22] he planned the whole thing that was a
[1:43:24] heart not seeking after god no religious
[1:43:27] but then god met him on the road to
[1:43:29] damascus because god knew that's my
[1:43:31] first church age messenger
[1:43:33] he let him be raised up in the at the
[1:43:35] feet of gamalia he let him become the
[1:43:37] pharisee of the pharisees
[1:43:39] god wasn't panicking god didn't put him
[1:43:41] in a zorb waiting for a time to be
[1:43:42] released upon the earth
[1:43:44] helena he let him be raised up in that
[1:43:46] way because he knew he had a time
[1:43:48] appointed
[1:43:50] and the apostle paul wasn't going on the
[1:43:52] road damascus saying i wonder if they
[1:43:54] are right
[1:43:55] i wonder i wonder if you know are we
[1:43:57] right i wonder if they're right and
[1:43:59] secretly you know reading the message of
[1:44:01] the hour
[1:44:03] you know on youtube on his phone as his
[1:44:05] honest horse what are you listening to
[1:44:06] the apostles
[1:44:08] you know no no he was like i'm going to
[1:44:10] kill these guys i'm going to stamp this
[1:44:12] thing out
[1:44:13] but yet god turned his heart
[1:44:16] if he can do it for the apostle paul he
[1:44:18] can do it for every single person
[1:44:20] hallelujah so don't be don't be so
[1:44:23] worried
[1:44:24] but they're going the wrong way well
[1:44:26] we're built to go the wrong way
[1:44:28] but there's something greater than our
[1:44:30] natural birth
[1:44:31] right there's something far greater than
[1:44:33] whatever traits
[1:44:34] that we receive from our parents and
[1:44:36] whatever traits we pass down to our
[1:44:37] children
[1:44:38] there's something far greater far far
[1:44:41] far far greater than that
[1:44:42] and that's god but when you let god be
[1:44:44] god and you create an atmosphere in your
[1:44:46] home
[1:44:46] and your children and we see actually
[1:44:48] it's from our hearts that we love him
[1:44:51] holy it's not something that we force
[1:44:52] them into a mold and say you better
[1:44:54] conform to this boy or girl otherwise
[1:44:55] you're in trouble no
[1:44:56] something for our heart just comes forth
[1:44:59] oh how i love jesus
[1:45:01] to me he is so wonderful he is so good
[1:45:04] he found me
[1:45:05] he brought me out i was lost and undone
[1:45:07] but one day
[1:45:08] my heart wasn't interested but one day
[1:45:10] there was a seed in there
[1:45:11] that he deposited before the foundation
[1:45:13] of the world and a light began to shine
[1:45:15] maybe just a little ray of sunlight
[1:45:17] but it began to shine down on me i
[1:45:20] realized lord
[1:45:21] yes there's more to life than what i
[1:45:23] know
[1:45:24] and he calls you out hallelujah
[1:45:27] and it's just like glory fills your soul
[1:45:30] you know we can have that kind of
[1:45:32] feeling
[1:45:33] he said oh but you're not going to have
[1:45:34] that feeling going all the way no but
[1:45:36] but you can have that kind of condition
[1:45:38] of your heart
[1:45:39] you know when he first met you your
[1:45:41] heart becomes like baby skin
[1:45:44] all soft and you know pliable and
[1:45:46] everything's good and
[1:45:47] you can keep your heart in that
[1:45:49] condition
[1:45:50] every day of your life remember we're
[1:45:53] not called to actually become all soft
[1:45:54] and pliable and god just does whatever
[1:45:56] and
[1:45:57] and then we become all calloused and
[1:45:58] hard and so i'm set in my ways i'm
[1:46:01] mature
[1:46:02] now hold on you can just be i think it's
[1:46:03] brother eugene braun said you know a rut
[1:46:06] it's just a grave with both ends kicked
[1:46:08] out to the end that's what a rut is
[1:46:11] i'm just i'm just i'm just stuck in my
[1:46:12] ways is it god's ways
[1:46:15] and what is it producing is it producing
[1:46:18] a meek
[1:46:19] loving spirit that power of god around
[1:46:22] you
[1:46:23] or some callous holder you know
[1:46:27] help us lord jesus because remember god
[1:46:30] doesn't put us in a zorb
[1:46:32] and say you know that's why that's why
[1:46:34] the devil said about job well you just
[1:46:36] put up an azorp god
[1:46:37] and you rolled him down the hill that's
[1:46:39] why he loves you and god said no no no
[1:46:41] when he gets out of that you can take
[1:46:43] him out of the zorb
[1:46:45] can we have that back up you just have
[1:46:48] this
[1:46:50] if i've gone too far
[1:46:55] you just have the safety shield hedge of
[1:46:57] protection around him
[1:46:59] that's why he loves you well no no no
[1:47:02] and god proved god proved to the devil
[1:47:05] and to job no no what you have is real
[1:47:08] and that's what he wants to do with us
[1:47:11] amen now
[1:47:16] hallelujah so god doesn't back up on his
[1:47:18] word
[1:47:19] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:47:20] god we read now we know the beginning of
[1:47:23] the creation of god is not
[1:47:25] as as some would say is that he was a
[1:47:28] separate creation that god made and then
[1:47:29] with that he actually created all things
[1:47:32] but he's actually the the beginning of
[1:47:34] the creation of god is actually that
[1:47:35] word beginning means author
[1:47:37] of the creation of god by him all things
[1:47:39] were created
[1:47:40] amen but then he's also what he's
[1:47:42] talking about is actually a
[1:47:44] a separate creation from the finished
[1:47:46] physical original creation
[1:47:48] and what that creation is is actually a
[1:47:51] bride
[1:47:52] created into his image amen okay
[1:47:55] i'll just read it i hope you don't mind
[1:47:57] the reading the beginning of the
[1:47:59] creation of god
[1:48:00] that is who the lord jesus says he is
[1:48:02] but those words don't mean exactly
[1:48:04] as they sound to us just taking them the
[1:48:07] way they sound has made some people
[1:48:09] in fact multitudes of people get the
[1:48:11] idea that jesus was the first creation
[1:48:13] of god
[1:48:14] making him lower than godhead two lords
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:17] then this first creation created all the
[1:48:20] rest of the universe whatsoever it
[1:48:21] contains
[1:48:22] but that is not right you know that
[1:48:24] doesn't line up with the rest of the
[1:48:26] bible the words are he is the beginner
[1:48:28] or the author of the creation of god now
[1:48:31] we know
[1:48:32] for surely that jesus christ is god very
[1:48:34] god he is the creator
[1:48:36] amen john 1 3 all things are made by him
[1:48:38] and without him was not anything made
[1:48:40] that was made
[1:48:41] he is the one of whom it said in genesis
[1:48:43] 1 1 in the beginning god
[1:48:45] created the heavens and the earth also
[1:48:47] it says in exodus 20 and 11
[1:48:49] for in six days the lord made heaven and
[1:48:51] earth and sea and all that's in them is
[1:48:53] and rested upon the seventh day see
[1:48:55] there is no doubt that he is the creator
[1:48:58] he was the creator of a finished
[1:49:00] physical creation
[1:49:01] surely we can see that these uh what
[1:49:03] these words mean now
[1:49:05] to have any other interpretation would
[1:49:07] mean that god created god
[1:49:09] how could god be created when he himself
[1:49:11] is the creator
[1:49:12] but now he is standing in the midst of
[1:49:14] the church
[1:49:16] as he stands there revealing who he is
[1:49:18] in this last age
[1:49:20] he calls himself the author of the
[1:49:22] creation of god
[1:49:23] this is another creation this has to do
[1:49:26] with the church
[1:49:27] this is a special special designation of
[1:49:30] himself
[1:49:31] he is the creator of that church the
[1:49:34] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:49:36] bride
[1:49:37] as the spirit of god he came down and
[1:49:39] created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:49:41] from which his body was born
[1:49:43] i want to repeat that he simply i mean
[1:49:47] um i want to repeat that he created the
[1:49:49] very cells in the womb of mary for that
[1:49:51] body
[1:49:51] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:49:53] simply give life
[1:49:54] to a human ovum supply by mary there
[1:49:57] would be sinful mankind producing a body
[1:50:00] that would be that would not have
[1:50:02] produced the last adam of him it was
[1:50:04] said lo a body has thou
[1:50:06] the father prepared for me god not mary
[1:50:09] provided that body
[1:50:10] mary was a human incubator and she
[1:50:12] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:50:14] to birth
[1:50:15] it was a god-man he was the son of god
[1:50:17] he was of the new creation
[1:50:20] man and god met and joined he was the
[1:50:22] first of this new race
[1:50:23] he is the head of this new race
[1:50:25] colossians 1 and 18 and he is the head
[1:50:27] of the body the church
[1:50:28] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:50:30] the dead and in all things that he might
[1:50:32] have preeminence
[1:50:33] second corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if
[1:50:35] any man be in christ he's a new creature
[1:50:38] old things have passed away behold all
[1:50:40] things have become new
[1:50:41] there you can see now that through man
[1:50:44] was of the old order or creation
[1:50:46] but now in union with christ he has
[1:50:49] become the new creation of god
[1:50:52] hallelujah ephesians 2 and 10 for we are
[1:50:54] his workmanship
[1:50:55] created in union with christ jesus unto
[1:50:58] good works
[1:50:58] i am in ephesians 4 and 24 and that ye
[1:51:01] put on the new man
[1:51:03] which after god is created in
[1:51:04] righteousness and true holiness this new
[1:51:06] creation
[1:51:07] is not the old creation made over okay
[1:51:11] now now we're talking about us okay so
[1:51:14] this new creation is not the old
[1:51:17] creation made over
[1:51:18] or it could not be called a new creation
[1:51:20] this is
[1:51:21] exactly what it is it's a new creation
[1:51:23] it's another creation
[1:51:25] distinct from the old one no longer is
[1:51:27] he dealing by the ways of the flesh
[1:51:30] that was how he dealt with israel he
[1:51:32] chose abraham and of abraham's issue
[1:51:35] through the godly isaac line
[1:51:36] but now out of every kindred tribe and
[1:51:38] nation he has purposed a new creation
[1:51:41] he is the first of that creation he was
[1:51:44] god
[1:51:44] created in the form of man now by his
[1:51:47] spirit he is creating many sons unto
[1:51:49] himself
[1:51:50] god the creator creating himself a part
[1:51:53] of
[1:51:53] his creation i mean this is the true
[1:51:56] revelation of god
[1:51:57] this was his purpose i mean this purpose
[1:52:00] took form through election
[1:52:02] that is why he could look right down to
[1:52:04] this last age
[1:52:06] when all would be over and see himself
[1:52:08] still in the midst of the church
[1:52:10] as the author of the new creation of god
[1:52:14] hallelujah amen his sovereign power
[1:52:17] brought it to pass by his own decree
[1:52:19] he elected the members of this new
[1:52:21] creation he predestinated them
[1:52:23] to the adoption of children according to
[1:52:25] the good pleasure of his will
[1:52:27] by his um omniscience and omnipotence he
[1:52:30] brought it to pass
[1:52:31] how else could he know what uh that he
[1:52:34] would be standing in the midst of the
[1:52:35] church receiving glory
[1:52:37] from his brethren if he did not make it
[1:52:40] sure
[1:52:42] we aren't a patched up job we aren't a
[1:52:45] renovated
[1:52:46] people we are a new creature
[1:52:49] amen that's why i said i think last
[1:52:51] sunday speaking from that
[1:52:52] um interview that brother brahm had that
[1:52:54] he referred to in the message paradox
[1:52:56] where that it uh mum and dad were
[1:52:58] talking about their son
[1:53:00] though he was baptized though he had
[1:53:02] come to the altar done all the right
[1:53:04] things outwardly
[1:53:05] i mean he did something to his fiancee
[1:53:07] that that that really hurt her
[1:53:08] and then brother abraham talked about
[1:53:10] while the lineage of the father was
[1:53:12] german then and the and the mother i
[1:53:14] think was italian or
[1:53:15] or or no no irish or vice versa and
[1:53:18] those traits are now bred into the boy
[1:53:20] and he's saying actually he's still an
[1:53:22] old creation
[1:53:24] because the natural lineage of the
[1:53:26] parents
[1:53:28] though they didn't have those traits
[1:53:30] anymore because they were born again
[1:53:31] brother iran said you're not like that
[1:53:33] because you've met the lord
[1:53:35] right so so they were a new creation
[1:53:37] they weren't a patched up model they
[1:53:39] were new
[1:53:40] right so the family traits that they
[1:53:42] should have had were now gone
[1:53:44] because the old man was there the new
[1:53:46] man had come alive right but the sun
[1:53:48] was still the old creation help us lord
[1:53:51] jesus that now we actually are new
[1:53:53] creation we're not just a patched up
[1:53:55] group where
[1:53:55] you know you know that that that we
[1:53:57] don't just see our natural family
[1:53:58] lineage living
[1:54:00] but we're actually a new creation
[1:54:02] hallelujah
[1:54:04] amen now how we doing okay now
[1:54:08] so he says that he is the author of the
[1:54:10] creation of god he is the faithful and
[1:54:12] true witness
[1:54:14] hallelujah but then now he has a
[1:54:16] complaint against the
[1:54:18] uh church in revelations 3 um if if
[1:54:22] you want to throw i might have it on the
[1:54:23] slide somewhere but he says because thou
[1:54:25] art lukewarm he says i know thy works
[1:54:30] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:54:32] either that thou wert
[1:54:34] i would that thou would cold or hot so
[1:54:36] then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:54:38] neither cold nor hot i will spew the out
[1:54:40] of my mouth
[1:54:41] now to look at this we just want to look
[1:54:43] at now what is in the mouth of god
[1:54:46] we understand that the bible never says
[1:54:48] that that we're in his mouth
[1:54:50] we are in his bosom we're engraved on
[1:54:52] the palm of his hands
[1:54:54] but we are never ever in his mouth so
[1:54:57] what is
[1:54:58] in the mouth of the lord the word
[1:55:01] right out of his mouth came a sharp
[1:55:04] twitch's soul which is the word of god
[1:55:06] amen so now because this church gets
[1:55:08] into this condition now
[1:55:10] they're not further on fire for god
[1:55:12] they're not ice cold
[1:55:13] but they just have enough religion just
[1:55:15] to like say well i'm a christian and i
[1:55:16] go to church
[1:55:18] amen but because they're this way they
[1:55:20] actually nauseate god and he actually
[1:55:22] spews them out of his mouth and what
[1:55:24] that means is now they no longer speak
[1:55:26] for him
[1:55:28] they now speak for their own selves
[1:55:31] so it's more than just yeah so it's not
[1:55:33] just a kicking out of a people
[1:55:35] it's actually what is in his word is i
[1:55:37] mean what is in his mouth is his word
[1:55:39] right and because they're lukewarm they
[1:55:41] no longer are where his word um
[1:55:43] they are not speaking for him anymore
[1:55:46] and if we are
[1:55:47] on fire for god he doesn't spew us out
[1:55:51] to what we are his word
[1:55:53] amen see see this
[1:55:57] has become flesh this has become flesh
[1:56:01] this does not produce a lady i see in
[1:56:03] church
[1:56:05] right this produces a bright church i
[1:56:08] mean so now
[1:56:09] now if we are on fire for god right
[1:56:12] then we will be the word of god amen
[1:56:15] now as i said many times the sermon it's
[1:56:18] not necessarily how it's physically
[1:56:19] manifested
[1:56:21] right because people have jumped and
[1:56:22] screamed and jumped up and down had
[1:56:24] great meetings but nothing's been
[1:56:25] produced
[1:56:26] right so it's not a physical outward way
[1:56:29] but that doesn't take away from the
[1:56:31] genuine jumping shouting and rejoicing
[1:56:33] right i don't want to pull you know the
[1:56:36] gutter on the both side of the road
[1:56:37] that's a ditch
[1:56:39] i want to stay down the middle of the
[1:56:40] road so the holy ghost causes me to jump
[1:56:42] around the church hallelujah
[1:56:44] if he caused me to stand still like this
[1:56:46] hallelujah if he caused me to shout and
[1:56:48] scream and speak in tongues hallelujah
[1:56:50] if it doesn't cause me to do that
[1:56:52] hallelujah
[1:56:54] right god's not a cookie cutter
[1:56:57] i mean so now what's happened is this
[1:56:59] church now does not speak for god
[1:57:01] the lady i see in church does not speak
[1:57:03] for god because they've been spewed out
[1:57:05] of his mouth
[1:57:06] where his word was his word is your amen
[1:57:08] so now
[1:57:09] but there has to be a people that will
[1:57:11] come back to the word again
[1:57:13] that god will actually speak through to
[1:57:14] be the final voice to the final age
[1:57:17] remember if you don't want
[1:57:21] okay we'll just if you don't want a
[1:57:24] spirit how do you get rid of a spirit
[1:57:25] that says jump
[1:57:28] you've got to be the mouthpiece of god
[1:57:31] amen hallelujah you actually have to be
[1:57:34] in such a way that god will it
[1:57:35] won't be you speaking to that thing
[1:57:37] it'll be god speaking to that thing
[1:57:39] oh we need the minister to do it no no
[1:57:41] no what about mummy and daddy
[1:57:44] amen because remember we being a father
[1:57:46] and a mother that's a god-given office
[1:57:49] that's a god ordained office and brother
[1:57:51] i'm even said about adoption a housewife
[1:57:53] that's an adopted place in the body
[1:57:56] hallelujah it means it's a powerful
[1:57:59] thing
[1:58:00] i mean so in that office you have
[1:58:01] authority to cast out devils
[1:58:03] things come and trouble your children
[1:58:04] your authority to cast it out
[1:58:06] i mean father has has had has more so
[1:58:08] being the head of the house
[1:58:10] being the gatekeeper of the home amen so
[1:58:13] that's why we can't blame things when
[1:58:14] when when
[1:58:15] when things come into our family and
[1:58:17] cause trouble well who opened the gate
[1:58:20] and if something else came another way
[1:58:22] well who who dealt with it that god came
[1:58:24] down and cast the spirit out
[1:58:26] we can't blame the world for the reason
[1:58:27] if our children are a certain way
[1:58:29] i mean because we have a power to get
[1:58:30] rid of it
[1:58:32] amen amen hallelujah otherwise we're
[1:58:34] absorbing again
[1:58:36] and zorbing makes you sick go around
[1:58:40] around we don't want to get sick
[1:58:44] okay amen now
[1:58:49] this is from the pergamon age he says
[1:58:52] now
[1:58:53] now jesus knew there was going to be a
[1:58:55] terrible drift away from the word in the
[1:58:56] pergamon age now
[1:58:57] now we're going to come back to what we
[1:58:59] just read there
[1:59:01] um which was yet 200 years from the
[1:59:04] patmos vision
[1:59:05] he knew that that drift would cause them
[1:59:07] to go into the dark ages
[1:59:08] he knew that the the way man originally
[1:59:11] got away from god was by first leaving
[1:59:14] the word
[1:59:14] if you leave that word you've left god
[1:59:17] thus he is presenting himself to the
[1:59:18] church of pergamos
[1:59:20] and indeed to all churches of all ages i
[1:59:22] am the word
[1:59:23] if you want deity in your midst which is
[1:59:25] god himself in your midst then welcome
[1:59:27] and receive the word
[1:59:29] amen that's why you hear even just
[1:59:32] anointed singing you hear the message
[1:59:33] you read the bible you say amen
[1:59:36] amen was it god comes down to that
[1:59:38] praise god comes down into that
[1:59:39] agreement
[1:59:41] hallelujah amen that's why it's
[1:59:43] important to aim in the word from your
[1:59:45] heart
[1:59:46] amen from here it can just be a um but
[1:59:49] that's still an amen
[1:59:51] efforts from here hallelujah god bless
[1:59:54] you brother isaac
[1:59:55] keep powering through don't let no one
[1:59:58] kick you around
[1:59:59] amen well it's true because people can
[2:00:02] stand be standing in front of me going
[2:00:03] like this and screaming and saying amen
[2:00:05] but there's no pull
[2:00:07] amen so you know it's got to be from
[2:00:10] here
[2:00:13] anyway amen don't ever let anyone or
[2:00:16] anything get between you and that word
[2:00:18] this is what i'm giving you the word is
[2:00:20] a revelation of myself i am the word
[2:00:22] remember that i wonder if we are now he
[2:00:24] says remember that i wonder if we're
[2:00:26] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[2:00:28] our midst
[2:00:29] you know that word is the lord of glory
[2:00:31] the great king of glory is the word now
[2:00:33] mitch
[2:00:34] are we sufficiently impressed with god
[2:00:35] himself being in our lives
[2:00:37] not just with us but in us are we has
[2:00:41] that
[2:00:41] impacted us enough i mean has there been
[2:00:43] an impact of the word
[2:00:45] i've been so impacted my life has
[2:00:47] changed forever it's not just a glancing
[2:00:49] blow but i've been impacted
[2:00:51] hallelujah you see like you know you're
[2:00:53] like the running the bulls or something
[2:00:54] you see some bull just run over someone
[2:00:56] i mean they got impacted hallelujah
[2:01:01] that's like god god just i just pray god
[2:01:03] just impacts us in such a way
[2:01:04] that we walk different we talk different
[2:01:06] we we we see
[2:01:08] different we hear different i mean why
[2:01:10] because god just got a hold of us
[2:01:12] hallelujah amen he can do it don't you
[2:01:15] believe it
[2:01:16] amen i wonder if we're sufficiently
[2:01:18] impressed with the word in our midst let
[2:01:19] me give you a thought here how do we
[2:01:21] pray we pray in jesus name don't we
[2:01:23] every prayer is in his name or is there
[2:01:24] isn't any answer
[2:01:26] yet in first john 5 14 we are told
[2:01:29] this is the confidence that we have in
[2:01:31] him that if we ask anything according to
[2:01:32] his will
[2:01:33] he heareth us and if we know that he
[2:01:36] heareth what
[2:01:37] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[2:01:39] petitions that we
[2:01:41] we have the petitions that we have
[2:01:43] desired of him how do we ask what is the
[2:01:44] will of god
[2:01:45] there's only one way to know his will
[2:01:47] and that is by the word of god
[2:01:49] lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth
[2:01:52] and it cometh to pass when the law
[2:01:54] commandeth it not there it is
[2:01:56] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[2:01:58] it so if i say if it's in the word you
[2:02:00] can have it amen
[2:02:01] amen you can have it if it's in the word
[2:02:03] you can have it it's mine
[2:02:04] hallelujah amen if it's in the word you
[2:02:08] can have it
[2:02:09] amen and we can't petition or ask him
[2:02:11] unless it's in his name
[2:02:13] amen there it is again jesus the word is
[2:02:15] the word i mean jesus the name is the
[2:02:17] word the will
[2:02:18] you can't separate god and the word they
[2:02:20] are one
[2:02:21] now then this word that he left behind
[2:02:23] on printed pages a part of him
[2:02:25] when you accept it by faith into a
[2:02:27] spirit-filled life
[2:02:29] he said that his word was life amen
[2:02:31] that's exactly what it is i am the
[2:02:33] and then here's the way on the way the
[2:02:34] truth and the life romans 8 9 be if we
[2:02:37] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[2:02:39] he's none of his there it is
[2:02:40] he is the spirit and he is life that is
[2:02:43] exactly what the word is that is exactly
[2:02:45] what jesus
[2:02:46] is he is the word so when a spirit born
[2:02:48] spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[2:02:50] word into his heart
[2:02:52] and places it upon his lips why that is
[2:02:54] the same as deity speaking
[2:02:55] every mountain has to go satan cannot
[2:02:58] stand before that man
[2:03:00] if the church way back there in that
[2:03:01] third age had only held on to the
[2:03:03] revelation
[2:03:04] of the living word in their midst the
[2:03:06] power of god would not have faded as it
[2:03:08] did in those dark ages
[2:03:10] and right today when the church returns
[2:03:12] to the word and faith amen we can say
[2:03:14] without doubt that the glory of god and
[2:03:16] the wonderful acts of god will be in her
[2:03:18] midst again
[2:03:20] what if we return to the word of god and
[2:03:21] faith amen
[2:03:23] hallelujah amen
[2:03:26] so we so we need to recognize now this
[2:03:29] word that's in our midst is the lord of
[2:03:31] glory
[2:03:32] hallelujah now the word now now this is
[2:03:35] from the church book again
[2:03:36] and forgive me for the reading but this
[2:03:38] is just how we are because you know
[2:03:40] i've said some things today and you look
[2:03:41] at me then i read it then you say okay
[2:03:43] so you know so so that's why it's like
[2:03:47] brother and paul did a couple of
[2:03:47] wednesdays ago we're just going to read
[2:03:48] some quotes and go home
[2:03:50] okay so here we are so now it says in
[2:03:52] revelations 3.
[2:03:53] no it's true you should look at some of
[2:03:54] you like really oh yeah okay you know
[2:03:57] so anyway now revelations 3 15 16 i know
[2:04:00] that works thou art neither cold
[2:04:02] nor hot i would that they now were cold
[2:04:05] or hot so then because they were
[2:04:06] lukewarm
[2:04:07] neither cold nor hot i will spew the out
[2:04:09] of my mouth
[2:04:10] we are going to look carefully at this
[2:04:12] now this is from the churches book
[2:04:13] ladies and church church it says that
[2:04:15] this latest in church age group is
[2:04:17] lukewarm this lukewarmness demands a
[2:04:18] penalty from god
[2:04:20] the penalty is that they'll be spewed
[2:04:21] out of his mouth here is where we don't
[2:04:24] want to go astray as a lot of folks do
[2:04:26] they are very unwisely say that god can
[2:04:28] spew you out of his mouth
[2:04:30] and that proves that there is no such a
[2:04:32] thing as any truth
[2:04:33] of the doctrine of the perseverance of
[2:04:36] the saints i mean perseverance of the
[2:04:37] saints
[2:04:38] so what's that saying people say well if
[2:04:40] you get lukewarm god's going to reject
[2:04:42] you and spew you out
[2:04:44] but then that actually goes against god
[2:04:46] actually
[2:04:48] preserving his saints okay hey if we get
[2:04:51] lukewarm god will bring us back and hot
[2:04:53] again
[2:04:54] we at cold is going to bring it remember
[2:04:55] if he wants us
[2:04:57] the bride though we may walk off the
[2:05:00] track he'll bring us back
[2:05:04] right
[2:05:09] you know people coming for the love of
[2:05:11] god then then that formalistic spirit
[2:05:13] comes along
[2:05:14] and they become formalistic or maybe the
[2:05:16] legalistic spirit comes along they
[2:05:18] become legalistic for a season i mean
[2:05:20] but if they're gods and if they really
[2:05:21] have the holy ghost god will bring them
[2:05:22] out of it
[2:05:24] right so you know just because the devil
[2:05:26] hits you one doesn't mean you're not a
[2:05:28] believer
[2:05:28] but if you do have the holy ghost you'll
[2:05:30] get up and you'll overcome that thing
[2:05:32] amen hallelujah i mean george washington
[2:05:36] lost a lot of battles
[2:05:37] in the uh war of independence but then
[2:05:40] he won
[2:05:41] they won the war i mean the allies lost
[2:05:43] a lot of war battles of world war ii but
[2:05:45] they won the war
[2:05:46] right so it's not him that loses the
[2:05:48] battle it's him that wins the war or
[2:05:49] wins the battle him that wins the war
[2:05:50] right
[2:05:51] amen so now hallelujah
[2:05:55] now it is i want to correct your
[2:05:58] thinking right now this verse is not
[2:05:59] given to an individual
[2:06:01] it's given to the church he's talking to
[2:06:03] the church for
[2:06:04] furthermore if you will keep the word in
[2:06:06] mind you will recall that nowhere does
[2:06:08] it say that we are in the mouth of god
[2:06:10] we are engraved on his palms we are
[2:06:12] carried in this bosom
[2:06:14] way back in the unknown ages before time
[2:06:16] we're in his mind
[2:06:18] we are in his sheepfold and in his
[2:06:20] pastures but never in his mouth
[2:06:22] but what is in the mouth of the lord the
[2:06:24] word is in his mouth
[2:06:26] matthew 4 and 4 but i uh but he answered
[2:06:29] and said it is written
[2:06:30] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:06:32] every word that proceeds out of the
[2:06:33] mouth of god
[2:06:34] the word is supposed to be in our mouths
[2:06:36] too
[2:06:38] now we know that the church is his body
[2:06:41] it is where
[2:06:43] uh it is here taking his place
[2:06:46] that will be in the mouth what will be
[2:06:48] in the mouth of the church the word
[2:06:50] right because we are christ's body upon
[2:06:52] the earth
[2:06:54] first peter 4 and 11 if any man speak
[2:06:57] let him speak of the oracles the word of
[2:06:59] god
[2:06:59] second peter 1 21 for the prophecy came
[2:07:01] not an old time by the will of man
[2:07:03] but holy men of god spake as they were
[2:07:05] moved by the holy ghost
[2:07:08] i mean so what is wrong with these
[2:07:09] people the last day they have gotten
[2:07:11] away from the word
[2:07:12] they are no longer fervent about it they
[2:07:14] are lukewarm about it
[2:07:16] and he says i want to prove this to you
[2:07:18] right now i'm gonna i'm gonna close okay
[2:07:20] i'm about to close okay
[2:07:23] the baptists have their creeds and
[2:07:25] dogmas based on the word and you can't
[2:07:26] check them
[2:07:27] they say the um apostolic days of
[2:07:31] miracles are over there's no baptism
[2:07:32] with the holy ghost
[2:07:34] subsequent to believing the methodists
[2:07:37] say based on the word that there's no
[2:07:38] water baptism sprinkling is not baptism
[2:07:40] and that sanctification is this baptism
[2:07:42] with the holy ghost
[2:07:43] the church of christ majors in
[2:07:45] regenerational baptism
[2:07:47] and in all too many cases they go down
[2:07:49] dry sinners and come up with ones
[2:07:51] yet they claim their doctrine is word
[2:07:52] based go right down the line and come to
[2:07:55] the pentecostals do they have the word
[2:07:56] give them the word test and see they'll
[2:07:58] sell out
[2:07:58] the word for a sensation just about
[2:08:00] every time
[2:08:02] if you can produce a manifestation like
[2:08:04] oil and blood and tongues and other
[2:08:05] signs
[2:08:06] whether in the word or not or whether
[2:08:08] properly interpreted
[2:08:09] from the word the majority will fall for
[2:08:11] it but what has happened to the word the
[2:08:13] word has been put aside
[2:08:15] so god says i am going against you all
[2:08:18] i'll spew out of my mouth
[2:08:20] this is the end four out of seven church
[2:08:22] ages i have seen nothing but
[2:08:24] men esteeming their own word above mine
[2:08:28] and you can bring that right down to the
[2:08:30] individual
[2:08:32] you know the biggest dangerous thing
[2:08:33] people say i feel led
[2:08:36] but it's got to be led by the word but
[2:08:38] that gives a lot of wriggle room
[2:08:40] well i feel led but as it's based on
[2:08:42] scripture
[2:08:44] amen but you see so so we can't esteem
[2:08:47] our own word above his
[2:08:48] amen his word remember he's the amen we
[2:08:51] can say a lot but then he just says the
[2:08:53] final
[2:08:53] bit right hallelujah
[2:08:56] amen so it will be at the end of the
[2:09:00] stage i'm going to spew out of my mouth
[2:09:01] it is all over i'm going to speak all
[2:09:03] right but yet yes i'm right here in the
[2:09:05] midst of the church the amen of god the
[2:09:07] faithful and true witness
[2:09:08] will reveal himself and will be by my
[2:09:10] prophet
[2:09:11] oh yes that is so
[2:09:15] hallelujah and in the days of the voice
[2:09:17] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[2:09:18] to sound the mystery of god should be
[2:09:20] finished as he has declared to his
[2:09:21] servants the prophets
[2:09:22] there it is he is sending a vindicated
[2:09:24] prophet he's sending a prophet
[2:09:26] after almost 2000 years he's sending
[2:09:28] someone who is so far from organization
[2:09:30] education the word of
[2:09:32] uh world of religion that is john the
[2:09:34] baptist and elijah of old he will hear
[2:09:36] only from god and will have thus saith
[2:09:38] the lord
[2:09:38] and speak for god he will be god's
[2:09:40] mouthpiece and he as it is declared in
[2:09:42] malachi 4 and 6
[2:09:44] will turn the hearts of the children
[2:09:45] back to the fathers
[2:09:47] he will bring back the elect of the last
[2:09:49] days and they will hear a vindicated
[2:09:51] prophet
[2:09:51] give the exact truth as it was with paul
[2:09:54] he will restore the truth as they had
[2:09:56] and those elect with him in that day
[2:09:59] will be the ones
[2:10:00] who truly manifest the lord and be his
[2:10:03] body
[2:10:03] and be his voice and perform his works
[2:10:06] hallelujah do you see it
[2:10:10] now if we are the and and
[2:10:13] and then he says now he says god raised
[2:10:17] up others and so it has gone
[2:10:18] on through the years until the last day
[2:10:21] there will be another people again in
[2:10:22] the land who under their messenger
[2:10:24] will be the final voice to the final age
[2:10:27] he says yes sir the church is no longer
[2:10:30] the mouthpiece of god it's its own
[2:10:31] mouthpiece
[2:10:32] so god is turning on her he will
[2:10:34] confound her through the prophet and the
[2:10:36] bride
[2:10:37] for the voice of god will be in her
[2:10:41] now to say that we are standing in place
[2:10:43] we are god's
[2:10:44] mouthpiece upon the earth that doesn't
[2:10:46] mean now we're speaking our own mind
[2:10:48] well god said this but now this is where
[2:10:50] we are so so this is what the jew said
[2:10:52] no
[2:10:52] the only way that that the bride is the
[2:10:55] voice of god upon
[2:10:56] the earth or the mouth mouthpiece of god
[2:10:58] is that god's mind is in her
[2:11:00] that it's not her speaking her own
[2:11:02] thought amen but it's god speaking his
[2:11:04] word
[2:11:04] right that's why we must be very careful
[2:11:06] to say what the message says
[2:11:08] right to actually stick what the bible
[2:11:11] says not to go beyond it we have
[2:11:12] boundaries in the word
[2:11:14] remember ruth was in boaz's field stay
[2:11:16] in that field
[2:11:17] stay in the field of the son of man
[2:11:18] don't look over the fence stay right in
[2:11:20] that word hallelujah and it will produce
[2:11:22] what it's meant to produce
[2:11:24] hallelujah but you see now well what has
[2:11:26] this got to do with kids absorbing in
[2:11:27] roads and
[2:11:28] and things it's got everything to do
[2:11:30] with it
[2:11:31] because if you now if you have the mind
[2:11:33] of christ and it's not your human
[2:11:35] ability
[2:11:37] trying to raise remember we're not to
[2:11:38] fashion our children after our own
[2:11:41] image amen i could make a little
[2:11:45] benjamin
[2:11:46] right i could form them in my image
[2:11:50] i don't want that i don't want them to
[2:11:53] be little benjamin jones loins
[2:11:55] i want them to love the lord and become
[2:11:57] one with him and be little mrs jesus is
[2:12:00] on the earth
[2:12:01] that's what we want amen right but the
[2:12:04] only way i can do that say lord
[2:12:07] come and live give me wisdom my god amen
[2:12:10] fall on our family give us a revival
[2:12:13] may my children may the church may
[2:12:15] everyone see that i love you more than
[2:12:17] anything
[2:12:17] that i am sold out i don't care about
[2:12:20] nothing else this world is falling apart
[2:12:22] but we have a sure word of prophecy in
[2:12:24] this day
[2:12:25] amen that will take us through every
[2:12:26] trial take us through every storm take
[2:12:28] us through every trouble
[2:12:30] hallelujah so lord jesus help us
[2:12:34] the road is paved the cars are out there
[2:12:38] the obstacles are there
[2:12:39] it's worse than it's ever been in the
[2:12:41] whole history of man
[2:12:44] but yet in the great darkness there's
[2:12:45] one standing present
[2:12:48] that can turn on the light which is the
[2:12:49] lord jesus christ you say it's real dark
[2:12:51] around
[2:12:52] now there's one that's the light jesus
[2:12:54] is the light of the world
[2:12:56] and he is working in our midst in our
[2:12:59] lives he is active in our lives
[2:13:02] to guide us through
[2:13:05] hallelujah we must keep our confidence
[2:13:08] upon him
[2:13:09] you say well my child just got hit by a
[2:13:12] truck
[2:13:13] now they want to jump we have a key of
[2:13:15] promise
[2:13:17] we have a key of promise that will open
[2:13:20] every door
[2:13:21] hallelujah we can't keep them from it
[2:13:25] but we can't throw them into it but we
[2:13:28] can by the holy ghost
[2:13:30] and that's just not that age you go read
[2:13:32] through the book of kings
[2:13:34] kings get blessed and there's always a
[2:13:36] turning point in there in their kingship
[2:13:38] they either they either fall or they
[2:13:41] continue on with god
[2:13:43] so it's not just young ages middle age
[2:13:45] too it's older age
[2:13:47] there's always a challenge god prospers
[2:13:49] someone
[2:13:50] and now they either get too big for
[2:13:52] their boots then god has to deal with
[2:13:53] them or they'll continue on with god
[2:13:55] like king uzziah god blessed and blessed
[2:13:57] and blessed him
[2:13:58] he wasn't a young fellow he was an adult
[2:14:00] and then he thought well he's just
[2:14:02] blessed and everything he can do
[2:14:02] anything he wants and he tries to be a
[2:14:04] priest in the
[2:14:05] in the temple there was that challenge
[2:14:09] there
[2:14:10] could he stay actually just under the
[2:14:12] hand of god and stay in his place
[2:14:14] oh but i'm blessed i can do anything i
[2:14:15] want hold on that was contrary to the
[2:14:17] word
[2:14:18] he started walking in his own will but
[2:14:20] yet religious yet
[2:14:22] it looked all fine so i say lord and
[2:14:25] that was what that was how the road was
