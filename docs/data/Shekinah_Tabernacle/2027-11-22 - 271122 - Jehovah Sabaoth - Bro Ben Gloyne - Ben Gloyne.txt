bless you I wonder all to have you here praise the Lord amen thanks guys so happy to have you here so God bless you wonderful to have you home amen amen first Samuel one and one who's going to read three verses here from first Samuel and then we then you can um you can have your seats this morning now see if I can pronounce these names I don't know why I seem to pick scripture as well the names are like this but hey anyway um and there was a certain man of uh ramothy and uh zofim of Mount Ephraim and his name was elkana the son of Johan uh the son of elohu the son of uh tohu the son of an ephraite however you say that and he had two wives and the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was uh uh pinea and pinea I had children but Hannah had no children and this man went up out of a city yearly to worship and do sacrifice under the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hoffney and philius uh uh Phineas sorry the priest of the Lord were there amen let's bear heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's pray together who has a need this morning say Lord would you come my way amen gracious father that's what we desire you come our way this morning Lord you

secret faults and our iniquities Lord knows we all covered in your blood today and may you have your way in the service we love you so much we thank you we have this opportunity together as a people and worship your own spirit and truth and we just want to pray Lord you'll be with us Lord may also be with all those who are watching by the way of the internet as well may he be glorified Lord Jesus may be praised and adored and may we walk out of these doors changed and renewed and refreshed Lord may you grant it dear God and Jesus Christ's name amen I mean God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to take a word I thought it was very interesting where uh uh Brother Jimmy's uh song selection you know he uh he is Jehovah Lord of creation and you know I I really like that uh because I want to take this where where uh we read here in verse three where it says that they went up to um um went out of a city yearly to worship and sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh now it's very interesting when you look into the scripture where where um God you know many times in English we just read God or the Lord or something and we just kind of glaze over really the full significance of of of what this says here and uh so so this uh the Lord of hosts is is Jehovah uh sabath uh yeah I think it's how you said which means so so this is um I was reading this where where we are reading through uh first Samuel as a family and um um I just really liked what um it uh uh Scofield said it as notes Here uh about this name of God which is Jehovah's Lord or Lord Lord of Lord of hosts Jehovah sabath um if that's how you pronounce it for the distinctive meanings of um Jehovah um here it says now it means with a special uh reference to Warfare or service and and they use these two ideas United Jehovah uh so that means Jehovah really in manifestation of power so this Jehovah sabath means it's in reference to Warfare or service and when you bring these two uh ideas together of warfare or service it means Jehovah and manifestation of power it says in Psalms 24 10 the Lord of hosts he is the Lord Of Glory and accordingly in the Old Testament the scripture this name is revealed in the time of Israel's need now this is very significant because when we look into when this name is is is used in the scripture it's tied into um it's it's not used in the first five books of the Bible so it's not time you know yes it's not used when when when when when when Joshua um you know when when Moses comes and takes Israel out of out of Egypt and takes them into the promised land you know it's not used in um and it's not used indirectly and Joshua or judges and it's really used in the Psalms but in Jeremiah which is the prophet where where he prophesies when when Israel is approaching National judgment it's used about 80 times and then in Malachi it's used in 25 times and then so in the Psalms it's used twice but then it's also used in in haggai 14 times now hey guys just two chapters now there's a reason I'm laboring this point now and in Zechariah in 14 chapters um Zechariah calls on the Lord of hosts about 50 times now this is very significant to me because because here this name is first used when when Israel is in a time of great crisis the the priesthood is backslidden the the you know Eli has become fat and he's just you know he's yo yo he's not correcting his sons like he should the you know the ministry has gone sideways the you know it's you know it's during a time of the time of judges of Revival and death and National problems and you know they're not taking the land like they should they're not growing as a kingdom like they should it's just a perpetuation of Revival and death you know that that you know that sin they'd worship the gods of other nations and then they would you know be be be uh delivered to the hand of those Nations then they would call upon God and God will send a judge they'd be delivered and then they'd walk with God for a certain amount of time and then they would fall into the same cycle of of idolatry and so on so so Israel was in a time of great trouble here yeah and and so it's very significant where where this is used because here they are in this time of national trouble but then here comes a man here now it's important when when when the name of God is used because when God reveals himself in a certain way the believer can access that part of God and so this now if I just continue here he says here so so as I said Malachi would use it 25 times the Psalms twice and then Zechariah um um 14 I mean 50 times in haggai twice right now but then but this name gathers so so so if you take this whole name of the hosts of of the Lord being Heavenly and then primarily the angels are meant here but the name gathers into itself the idea of all Divine or Heavenly power is available for the need of God's people saying that all that God is is available during these great times of trouble so so haggai and Zechariah they lived in a time of restoration where where Israel was there in in Babylon 70 years and then God said it's going to time for them to return and they return to Israel to rebuild the Temple so so so rebuild or restore worship and and also to restore Jerusalem so here was here was two prophets prophesying in this time now we know when they rebuilt Jerusalem was in trouble sometimes it wasn't a time of peace they had to they'd have the trail in one hand and a sword in the other when they were rebuilding the walls and and But but so haggai and Zechariah would would would speak about the lord of the Lord of hosts is with them saying that God all of God's Heavenly power was what the Believers to restore Israel to restore Jerusalem and the Temple now I think this is very significant because we understand we live in a restoration time so not only do we live in a time of trouble because we know with Jeremiah it was just a nation approaching judgment but we know in this day it's the world is going into judgment where soon this world is going to step into a Great Tribulation but we know before that the bride has raptured up into Glory where we don't have to go through that Great Tribulation time but we go to the wedding supper of the Lamb amen but this world is going into a time this whole world is going to a time of uh Judgment of of of a Great Tribulation so before this time because Jeremiah we know he prophesied before this happened and even when the Captivity happened but he would call say he's basically telling Israel the Lord of hosts is here you don't have to go into this judgment you can all of Heaven is there behind you to deliver you from going down this road and it's the same thing today where all of Heaven is present amen that we can go we can walk into a body change where we don't have to go into a Great Tribulation that any anything we have need of we can access by the blood of Jesus Christ amen now the first time now this may be a bit laborious this morning we just want to go through this slowly because I think sometimes we kind of take for granted the name of Jesus Christ we know it's the name of God and it's the name above all names but there's a there's the most power and all creation is in that name it's not just a name it is the name amen where the New Testament Church of the other prophesy though preach and cast out devils in his name and the gospel must be preached in his name amen until the you know into the world so you know there's great power in this name and we can see you know if we can look into the scripture and see that the god of the Old Testament is the god of the new it doesn't go one God in the old and then and then you know you know where Matthew 1 1 comes in then it's a different God it's the same god Jehovah of the oldest Jesus Christ of the new so we can draw strength from the name of God from the Old Testament because we can realize that what he was in the old is the shadow he's here in reality form that everything we have need of is in him and we can get access by faith into him now the first time that a Heavenly Host would be recognized in the scripture was when Jacob was returning back to his homeland and he knew that when he returned back there he would have to come and come contact with Esau now Esau was the one who stole the birthright from he was the you know Esau by by by order of birth had the right to the to to the birthright but but there was something in Jacob that wanted it above everything and that shows a real believer that they want the baptism of the Holy Ghost above all things they're not interested in just taking for grinder well I'm a Christian I go to church I believe the message they want to know him and so and so Jacob had the burden he must have that Birthright praise the Lord here's here's the here's the big heavy artillery for this afternoon praise God you're gonna be worried there brother Dave God bless you amen but yes I hear so so here Jacob he wanted the birthright more than anything now as he's returning in Genesis 32 it says and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place Maha name which means a place of two camps so that means that not only there was the camp of Jacob returning back to their Homeland but there was a Heavenly Camp so so so where they were walking there was an Angelic Camp going around them and I think this is very significant because if we can realize who's with us every day it's not you alone in this walk but God is with you the angels of heaven are with you it's very powerful if we realize who was with me in this life's journey where we would never feel alone if we realized he was with us amen that we are not alone he says I'll never leave thee nor forsake Thee I trust there's something in your heart saying that's talking about me it's not just a nice idea but there's something in my heart says I will never be alone amen there may not be a physical person around me but I am not alone because the Lord is with me and then so but but what I love about this is Jacob did not just recognize the Angels were there but he knew that in that atmosphere he could get a hold of someone that he could be changed now Jacob we know his name meant supplanter he was a shyster he cheated his brother out of the birthright he cheated leban out of many things and you know because he was living according to his name now there's great power and significance and names that's why it's important to always look at a meaning of a name before you name anyone a certain name and so Jacob so so Jacob needed to be changed so he knew in that host it was not only Angels God himself was there and he would wrestle with God all night until God changed him and so not only he wanted the birthright he needed real change in his walk because after he was touched by God he says I'll not let you go till you bless me where where the angel which is God Angelic form would touch him on his leg and he began to walk different so after God touches you and I we walk different we talk different it's not our physical step how has changed but it's our character it's our conduct it's our nature it's how we talk to people it's how we dress and different things our whole Christian Walkers changed after the Lord has touched us and so he recognized not only the Angels were there but God was there and he could wrestle with him and be changed and so when he went and he saw saw his brother Esau he was a different man Hallelujah why because the host of God was with him amen and then and then and then even even with the bride there is two camps there's this camper there's a Heavenly Camp around us praise the Lord so I you know I love the story of you know Elisha here where where the enemy has surrounded their city and your brother Brown would dramatize it where where Elisha's servant would go out you know in the morning take the milk bottles which people used to do once upon a time put them by the front gate that you know and then you know and then and then and then the servant would go out and he'd look and see the enemy had encamped around the city and then so now the servant began to panic because he realized we're done we're him done we can't get out the enemy's going to take the city he's going to kill us because he's after you Elijah and you know you know he was getting really troubled about it but then Elijah prayed he said Lord open open the Man's eyes now his prayer didn't cause the angels to come down because after the prayer the servant realized he he looked around so all the hills around the cities it was all the fiery Chariots of the armies of God of the Angelic forces were all around the prophet and then so now they now the servant was more caught up in he wasn't caught up in the fact that the enemy was there he has more caught up in whoa God's God's Heavenly Host is surrounding us now his prayer did not cause the armies to come down it didn't cause the armies to move into position it didn't cause them to there but it caused the servant's eyes to come open to what was already there and if our spiritual eyes could come open this morning see God is here the angels of heaven are here amen Jesus is here we know we'll meet him physically in the air right we know we're physically going to meet his physical body but his his spirit is here All That Heaven is is upon the Earth right all that Jesus is is here the angels of God are here so therefore all that God is is present in this room right now he would say you know where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst you know if we could really grasp that by faith that he's between you and I he's between you and the person next year the person in front of you behind you he's in the midst of us even now his angels have gathered to attention they have come to you know when we were worshiping God they would just stand there and watch because they could maybe sing the same songs but the reality the revelation of those songs they could never sing because they'd never know what it's like to be redeemed and to be you know you're going to be reconciled back to God their sins taken away you know they don't know anything of you know of the atonement but we do so we can sing the praises to God that they could never sing because we know what it's like to be lost and be found Amen to be blind but to be able to see you know to be you know spiritually dead to be alive in Jesus Christ we we understand what those things are like I trust you do amen you can say once upon a time I was one way now I'm a different way because the Lord came and interrupted my life and changed me forever oh look yeah so so that cause so his prayer didn't make the Angels come down it made the servant's eyes come open to see who was already there amen so I pray that'd be the same thing with us we would see who's already with us now now let's say in Psalms 34 and 6 this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the Lord and campeth about those that fear Him and delivereth them so our God encamps about us he doesn't just and and he doesn't just encamp about us just to like you know like someone's who's a spectator you know watching a sports game eating some popcorn and cheering on and no no he doesn't just encamp about us and walk with us as in some silent God that's just observing he's not that way in our lives but he is daily part of our lives right because because he doesn't just encamp around about us but he delivers us right so he actively intercedes on our needs if we have a trouble whatever he actively delivers us from those needs amen amen I mean I mean I mean from those problems that's what he does this is what our God is in the delivering business amen he is not just a silent Observer he doesn't just sit up in heaven with his his arms crossed and just watch the unfolding of his plan no he's actively involved in our lives do you believe that this morning amen you're going to believe that he's not some distant God the you know the devil will will try and make you think he's not interested in you he doesn't care he doesn't talk to you and you you know your prayers don't work and he's distant somewhere and you know that may be uh you know part of the devil's testimony but it's not our testimony no he is our helper amen he's our he's our he's our help in time of trouble right he's a present help in time of trouble right he always turns up on time according to what we need amen so I you know I thank God that God is with us amen Hallelujah now now Israel was in a time of great need when they went up to worship every year and so they were approaching a place of worship of of of the Lord of hosts where they could get everything they had need of was in was in Jehovah God right there now as I said in the beginning it's very easy just to gloss over gloss over when we read God or the Lord God or something in the scripture but each has a great significance now just to just to quickly do a very quick overview of this we're gonna we're gonna go so in Genesis 1 it's very it's very interesting when you read about the order of creation where it says in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth now that word God there is is is Elohim which means object of worship just means god right now now it doesn't change until we come into Genesis 2 where where God is about to form Man Out of the Dust of the earth which says and the Lord God so in chapter one it says God made this and God did this and God did this but then when when man is about to be able to formed Out of the Dust the other says and the Lord God now this made you seem well that's just English it doesn't mean anything but in reality it has great significance because if we can look at what God did in the garden we can look at what God wants to do with you amen because we know in Genesis 1 1 the Earth was about form and void Darkness coveted Waters cover the face of the deep and you know it was in total darkness and we were in total darkness right but but if you read through the order of creation where it talks about botany life it doesn't say he created the seeds but he just caused them to come forth because they were already laying in the earth it's the same thing with you and I there was a seed of predestination in our soul amen before we're born it was there and but when we're born into this world we have a spiritual Amnesia we don't know who we are we don't know who our God is we don't know where we're going you know we may be raised in a Christian culture we may have a message culture whatever it is but there comes a time when God begins to brood over your life like he moved over the spirit of the waters because he knew under those Waters there was a seed amen and he wants every seed to come forth after its kind he wants it to come to full manifestation he doesn't just want to sit there as a seat saying look I've got seed now he wants it to come to life amen it's like if you're growing a garden you don't want to just leave the seeds on the Shelf you want to plant those seeds in its season that whatever you want to harvest from those seeds you'll get if you want pumpkins you put pumpkin seed in a certain time in a certain time you get pumpkins that's what you're looking for or or tomatoes or whatever it may be because you put seed in the ground it's the same thing with God not just now he's not talking about fruit and veggies now I'm talking about you and I right because he wants us to come to our full manifestation so so Darkness covered the world all those things he caused the separation of the darkness in the water to move and different things that that seed would come forth that they that that the darkness would move back and the light would would strike the seat you know strike the soil the soil will come to a certain temperature then life would germinate in the seed and it would come forth it's the same thing with you and I we're once very cold and different in darkness people right but then God began to brood over our lives we're going to move move Darkness back I mean move Waters back move judgments back move trouble back until finally amen a warmth came over our lives then what happened a new birth happened amen a seed came to life a different life that we once were living amen a new life came in Hallelujah why because he knew there was a seed in you that's why he brewed you you know that's why he speaks to your heart tries to get your attention deals with your life you know corrects you when you're wrong convicts you when you're in sin why because he wants you to come and meet him praise God Amen to this word God just means now if we you know if I have my notes here right yeah it just means the South you know Elohim is the Hebrew word for God here the self-existing one but then when but then when you know but we we know and God was attributes and him was to be a father to be a savior to be a redeemer you know to be a Healer to be a restorer to be a God to be a priest to be a counselor to be a comforter you know to be everything every attribute you know I'm just you know you know I haven't covered them all there but you know there's many attributes in them but he must Express them and then so when when man was going to be formed Out of the Dust the Earth it you know changes to the Lord God now this has significance because now remember this is not a different God so it's not and God did this and the and then then the Lord God turns up and then begins to deal with man it's the same God right it's the same God and then so now now Lord here is is Jehovah I mean Jehovah the primary meaning of the name Jehovah is a self-existent one literally as in Exodus 3 14 he that he that who is and therefore the Eternal I am but Harvard from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed signifies also to become so that is to become known thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation now combining these meanings of Harvard we arrive at the meaning of the name Jehovah which he is the self-existent one who reveals himself the name in itself and Advance upon the name of God suggests attributes of deity so here he is he was God but then when man began to come into the picture he becomes the Lord God the self-existent one who reveals himself now he the reason he changes his name here is because now he has someone upon the Earth he can reveal himself too as I said I think last Sunday he couldn't reveal himself to the birds or the bees or the trees or the whales or the chimpanzees or whatever no he could only reveal himself to part of himself because remember Adam and Eve were part of God they weren't a different kind of creation they were his offspring so now he had his offspring or part of himself upon the Earth he could make himself known to them amen that's why you know what the disciples you know after Judas left to try them different things did he begin to reveal things to the disciples he couldn't before he left because he was speaking now to his children amen so so many times God will reveal things to to us you know that's not necessarily to the world right now everyone has a potential to be saved don't get me wrong because God wants everyone to come I wish we'd have to build a stadium to have church in amen what because the Salvation would go to all corners of the earth amen that's what I would love to see not just for numbers sake but people would be saved amen this is what we want to see isn't it amen so so now so so now he has part of himself upon the Earth that he can reveal himself to and that's the same thing with you and I he is the self-existent one who reveals himself now well you could say but he's revealed himself the full Revelation is is here and that is true but is that full Revelation in you see it's one thing for it to be sitting in print form it's another thing for it to be a revelation in your heart right so he has revealed himself in print form but he has to come and make that word live in you amen because remember Jesus said when the spirit of Truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth see a legion guide you into all truth of his word amen so so it's sure it was a revelation to Moses when he wrote it or any of the prophets right or the or or Paul or different ones but it's a revelation to you and I so God is the self-existent one but he wants to reveal himself to you and you're glad he's a personal God this morning amen he's not just any old guy but but he's a personal God he's not just your neighbor's God or your spouse's God he's your God Amen so he wants to reveal his attributes to you amen so we you know we understand that that that before there was any sin any trouble any sickness any death any sorrow any pain there was a God who could save heal and redeem before that amen because what is greater hatred or love love is greater what is greater sin or a savior a savior why because a savior was here before there was sin right there was a savior before anything was lost amen there was a redeemer before anything was here to be redeemed amen there was there was love before there was ever hatred right because God is Fountain of love amen so so in him were all these attributes but he needed to express them so he allowed the devil to do what he did in order for God to be fully made manifest to the Earth so you know it's a strange change thing but you really think when you really think about it Adam and Eve could only know God a certain amount because remember they were never sick they never had sorrow they were never lost they never had trouble they never felt afraid they never needed comforting they never needed guidance they never needed counsel they never needed a high priest they never needed a lamb they didn't need any blood but they didn't need any of those things before sin right but all that was in God they never needed a Shepherd because they never needed guiding so then the Devil comes along he and God knew it was going to happen he allows it to happen and then now the World falls under sin and then God actually allows that to happen that he can fully Express himself in a way that could never before a fall so now we can worship God in far greater Revelation then Adam and Eve could before the fall that may be a strong statement but you think about it before the fall they could never worship him that that they've been healed they never needed healing oh they never they could never worship him a savior or guide or Redeemer or lamb or sacrifice or any of those things because they never needed it right but now we can stand here and and worship God you say but they they never had sorrow they never had sickness they never had trouble surely their worship would have been a lot easier do you know God has made us to worship we can worship God in spite of trouble in spite of sickness sorrow pain hardship trouble we can worship God and be Anointed with the spirit of God and praise him even with these things around because remember we are not Overcomers because God takes away trouble what we overcome even in the presence of trouble right because to take away a Temptation doesn't mean you overcome it it just means the temptation's gone right but but an overcomer can actually stand in the face of Temptation and not give themselves to it that's real overcoming and we are living in the age of the Overcomer right why because the Lord of hosts has revealed himself in this day that all of Heaven all that he is is now behind you and I Hallelujah so now they could worship God but then we can worship God and if I agree to measure than they ever could that's just me you might think that's a bit strong but you know I was lost now I'm found they could never they could worship as Creator as father I can do that too he's my father when when you receive the Holy Ghost you realize who your real father is so so and I know he created me so so I can worship Him in those ways but then that's when their worship stops and mind continues on Amen because I was lost on found I was blind now I see I was dead and sins but now I'm alive in Christ you know I've been sick but I've been healed you know I've been in trouble but now I've got peace you know so I can worship Him far more than they ever could but hey I tell you what when we get on the other side our worship will all join together and it's amazing because you think about it really you know you know on this side of Calvary and even on this side of things when the end of all things has happened the words come open the Lamb's taking the book and loose the seals you know we worship God you know in a way that we're just rejoicing in the promises we have received even even the change of the body we are in a resurrection cycle right now we're living in a Rapture cycle amen because he's transformed our souls from Death to life so our souls you could say are in a raptured condition now our bodies just got to catch up they'll get there but they've just got to catch up I'm into what's already happened within us right but so now if you go back to Genesis they were looking for all these promises to be fulfilled they were standing there saying one day it'll happen and that's why in Genesis 5 you know no doubt when um you know it speaks about Adam's um you know Adam's line it says and then man began to call upon the name of the Lord so so they why would they call upon God because they they had a longing based on their parents testimonies of what was going to happen because no doubt they would have sat there now we know the first bubbles Written in the Stars we don't read that Bible because this is our Bible right but it's all in the Stars right and so no doubt they would they would sit there under the you know around the campfire at night or maybe not even with one no no light pollution who's ever been to a place like that there's no light Blues you're going to see the Milky Way in all of its Glory I remember being in Vanuatu once one of the northern islands and there's just no like they've got generators but they barely work there's no real lights there just a village and it's just a whole sky is just lit up and I just wanted to stand there like this the whole time I've never seen the Milky Way in all of its Glory like that but they were just you know but the locals well they live under it all the time so they weren't they weren't so transfixed like that but the reason they got used to it and they used to living in that kind of condition is because they had no man-made lights really to blot it out but then when when all the man-made lights are going out then we can really see what's above us and I trust it's the same thing you know there's a lot of man-made lights in this day of reasoning of politics of you know of religion you know of of ideas and culture I trust all those man-made lights go out that we can see the host above us we can see God is there and not just above us but with us and in US amen so so you know no doubt they would sit around the campfire even just look at the stars at night and then Adam would begin to begin to read the scriptures and they would tell the promise of of you know because they try and no doubt try and relate to their children what it was like to live in the garden no sickness sorrow death pain nothing it was perfection and then they would always come down no doubt to the to the story where it says yo God promised the seed of the woman's going to come and bruised the head of the seed of the serpents in other words God is going to become a man and undo what happened there so I believe that would have put a real longing in the in in their descendant's hearts that's why they call upon the name of the Lord in other words Lord when are you going to fulfill your promises when is this seed of the woman going to come they were under expectations sure they had the blood of the lamb but they were looking for thee lamb to come they had a longing now it's hard to relate to that because we're on the other side right we're not looking for him to come and take our sins away he already has right and he's already given us the Holy Ghost and he's opened his word to us we're standing on the other side of the promise rejoicing that it's all done now we're beneficiaries of of of all that prophecy being fulfilled now we're living in it but they are on the other side where it was all prophecy Hallelujah so we can stand here and praise God because they're looking they're hey no doubt they are excited they were emotional they would have been a hunger Lord when's this going to happen but it wasn't for them right it was for you and I in this day so we can praise God I think in a real special way amen hallelujah we have a lot to praise God about you can just go through the scripture look all of his promises he's fulfilled and then all the promises he's fulfilled in your life they should link together anyway you just have I don't know how much time you need to clear your schedule for quite a while all the praise breaks you'd have about how good he is amen praise the Lord so now God would reveal himself down through the Old Testament he would he would speak here in Genesis 12 and 1 to Abraham now we're going to jump around a bit here but but God would reveal himself to Abraham it says now the Lord said unto Abraham get the out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from my father's house into a land that I'll show thee now this word Capital Lord is is Jehovah and then he would come in Genesis 17 and 1. he says I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now God's done things in his life since then but you know it's not a different God I just want to emphasize this you know it's not a different God it wasn't then Jehovah spoke to Abraham and told him to leave his country go to another land and then the almighty God comes along that's exactly the same God now this word almighty god um it means it means it means El Shaddai now now the root word of Shaddai means means means the breasted one like a like a mother that breastfeeds her baby so here is Abraham he's well up in years he cannot fulfill the promise of Isaac coming him and Sarah cannot but he's been given the promise of the promised son and then so now God is revealing himself to Abraham as as as El Shaddai and what he's basically saying is he said Abraham I am the life-giver I'm the strength Giver just like a mother would nurse her newborn and and and all the strength and all the sustenance and all the nutrients from her would go into the baby just that way you feed off my promise you nurse off me and you'll get strength to fulfill the promise that I've given you and he is still El Shaddai this morning well we can take the promises of God that he's given to us and we can nurse strength from those promises remember God doesn't wave a promise in front of you to discourage you he doesn't wave a promise in front of you to dishearten you and discourage you no he waves a promise in front of you saying this is yours to increase your faith because he says now this is your promise nurse off it and you'll get strength and it will be fulfilled why because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so so so as we nurse off the promise Faith builds unbelief never builds Faith bills unbelief has to go away as we nurse off the promise mind battles have to leave double-mindedness have to believe has to leave as we feed off the promise of God because if you think about it we are we are you know we are a certain volume right or mass or whatever you want to call it just like this bottle now now if there was oil and water in here you could say that the what floats the oil floats right so you could say the oil is is unbelief if this was full if there's full of so just say this is your mind we're born it's full of unbelief it's full of oil okay but then we begin to get the promises of God and New Birth happens right we get the promises of God and now our mind only contains a certain much our conscious thinking yeah but now in order to replace our current thinking we need something else to come and to replace it with right so now if your mind is doubting and troubled and you know everyone's wrong and this is a problem whatever more you just need your thinking to be changed but because remember With God all things are possible and then Jesus said it all things are possible to them that believe so there's nothing is impossible with you that's what he's saying because all things are possible within belief now how do we but but then how do we come to a place that faith can take a hold well brother Brown taught us that first the word's got to come into the mind and then it's accepted in the mind that it comes down to the soul and then Faith takes takes us you know your manifestation so if our mind is filled of unbelief and doubting and trouble because the devil wants us he wants to preoccupy our thinking he wants us to look at everything else but nurse off the promise because he knows if we come in contact with a promise a nurse of it we'll get strengthened hey he's on his way amen he's defeated he's under our feet so now in order to change our thinking all we need to do is replace negative thinking with good thinking well then how do we do that well you take the promises of God and you begin to feed on them and then eventually all of the oil will become water your mind will be full of Faith right full of promises you have a positive outlook positive thinking and this is not the power of positive thinking but I'm going to show you that really all of Heaven is there at our disposal but it takes you to dispense it and we'll get to that later amen that's why it's very important that we don't just you know don't just sit in doubt but we but we nurse off the promise God is more than able amen just it now he comes as almighty God here in Genesis 17. now if we go forward to the Book of Exodus it says next to the six and one and the Lord said unto Moses this is this is Jehovah this is the same one that spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12 and 1. she said it says then the Lord said unto Moses then now shall see what I'll do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand will he let them go and with a strong uh um hand shall he drive them out of his land and the Lord spake unto Moses saying I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by the name of Jehovah was I not known to them now hold on but we just read that you know the Lord or Jehovah made himself known so what does he mean by that well what he means is that they had never needed a deliverer before Abraham Isaac and Jacob were never slaves they were never in bondage they were never under the oppression of a foreign government you know they weren't slaves so God is going to come as Jehovah in a different way as in deliverer they never needed delivering before right but the Israelites here in Exodus they're under hard bondage they're crying out to God because now comes a time of promise but then also so now God's saying they don't they didn't know me by this name so I'm going to reveal part of my character that I couldn't reveal to them because they didn't need it amen said God's going to come as a delivery and we know that you know he would he would come and deliver and he would take them out of Egypt and take them into the promised land now what I love about this is that he says and I've also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Cain and the land of their pilgrimage when they were strangers and I have also heard the groanings of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I've remembered my Covenant wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I'll bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I'll rid you out of their bondage and I'll redeem you with an outstretched arm with great judgments and I'll take take you to me for a people and I will and I will beat you a God and you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of Egypt and I'll bring you unto the land concerning which I'd swear it to give it to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and I will give you and uh give give it you for a Heritage I am the Lord now so what he's saying is I'm going to return you back to the land of your fathers now we live in a time when we have returned back to our homeland right our homeland is the word of God right the anointed word of God where our where the apostolic fathers were in that land but then down through the Dark Ages and a Reformation you know down to the Dark Ages they left out land for Creeds and dogmas they went under slavery but then under Lutheran different ones that now came a Reformation I mean and then now we live in a time of restoration we've been where we have been restored back to the original faith of the fathers so when it says that now now I'm going to show myself as deliverer here God God is also showing us that he's going to deliver us out of this yoke of bondage of of religion and unbelief and culture and things I'm going to take you back to your true Homeland which is the word of God Amen but he they did not know him by the name of Jehovah Abraham Isaac and Jacob but he's going to reveal himself in this way now just stick with me okay because soon lunch will happen right it'll be there all right so so we'll get there okay I'll get to a certain spot and I'll quit and then we'll sing and then we'll go home now we're going to realize that in Isaiah 43 it says I even I am the Lord besides me there's no savior so there's no different God remember it wasn't a multiple different number of gods that met Abraham it was the same God revealing himself right it was a continuous revelation of the same God to Abraham that's the same thing with you and I you know God doesn't reveal all of his character to us in one go right he reveals himself as we walk with him amen you know maybe we just done first of course as a savior right but then we see that he's redeemed us and then he heals us then he leads us and guide us counsels us you know is Our Shepherd different attributes that he shows us as we walk with him along the way so now he would say in Isaiah 43 and 11 I even I am the Lord besides me there's no savior there's no savior besides the Lord now that Lord means Jehovah right and he and he says in Isaiah 55 and 5 I am the lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I go to thee though thou Hast not known me that and he says that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that is numb beside me I am the lord and there is none else so he's declaring very openly there's no other God it's only me I'm the only one right here there's no other God beside me so he's the only savior he's the only God now Isaiah would say earlier now now we now I'm going to make a transition now because all of these names of God that we could go through the you know the you know the you know the different Redemptive names of Jehovah and all the names of God they're all wrapped up in Jesus Christ the name Jesus Christ so now he would you know you know Isaiah would prophesy therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and it's an Isaiah 9 and 6 run to us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace now if we jump forward here into Matthew um you know the angel comes the angel Gabriel or the angel of the Lord actually appears to Joseph now I'm just taking this bit because earlier we have Gabriel will come to Mary and tell she's going to have the promised son and then the angel Lord appears to Joseph because Joseph is minded to put his wife you know put put Mary away privately different things but then you know so he's pondering these things so he doesn't understand how Mary could be with child because she's a righteous woman you know but then but then she's with childhood how could this be and she said an angel's visited me and it just doesn't make sense to him but then but then God the angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream and he says do not you know fear to take under the Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now now if we think about this but hold on but I thought his name would be Emmanuel I thought his name would be wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace So what's going on here is this Angel wrong no this Angel is right because all of those descriptions of God what he would be is is encapsulated in the name Jesus maybe because even Jesus means Jehovah's salvation so now as he was a deliverer there in Exodus 6. of of Israel out of Egypt and taking them to the promised land he's going to bring a far greater order of Deliverance because that was just a physical Deliverance where they were slaves physically and then they went to a Promised Land but the thing is under the blood of bulls and goats they could never be delivered from the slavery of unbelief so because their hearts could never be changed because the life of the blood of bulls and goats could never come unto them and change their nature I mean that's why that's why David with all of us learned behavior where he'd say I have not you know I always said the Lord before my face I said not against them and you know different things he'd say when he saw Bathsheba all of that learned behavior of Walking with God went to one side because his nature wasn't changed right even though he was he was a man after God's Own Heart he sincerely served the Lord but because it was just learned behavior there was no blood in that day to change his nature as soon as Sin presented itself he jumped into it but unto the blood of Jesus Christ he can change he changes our nature he makes us a new creation he doesn't just patch us up he makes a new creature praise the Lord I'm glad about that I trust you are happy about that too amen that sin nature no longer governs our lives but we've been liberated from the slavery of unbelief from sin amen he's changed our nature to give us a nature of faith praise the Lord that's the only way you can walk with God is is because you know Paul would say in Galatians that it's not circumcision or uncircumcision but it's but a new creature avails that's the thing that has power right so so that's the most important thing now so you call his name Jesus he shall save his people from their sins now we've got to realize that this is exactly what the Lord did so so here was the highest name that God would ever give himself is in Jesus Christ right Jehovah's not as high as that almighty God El Shaddai all those names are encapsulated in the name of Jesus Christ this is the highest revelation of the name of God given to man why because it would show in the Manifest age because with the name is a manifestation of power right just like he was Jehovah to deliver Israel what they were Redeemed by Blood and by Power by the blood of the lamb and The Exodus but was the power of God that delivered them and so every time God's name is there who's with me today okay I trust you're with me no so because there's power in that name we're going to realize who we talk to where to realize who we pray to you know don't take it for granted while I'm talking to God well who's this God he's not just a force like some ether wave somewhere he's a person he's a being and he made all things and so he began to manifest his name praise the Lord why because he was called by that name and you live whatever your name is naturally you'll have a character based on that name it'll influence your character amen so he went about the first thing he did he began to cast out Devils heal the sick raise the dead gather his people to himself why that he would after the after he shed his blood upon the cross and Rise Rose triumphant on the third day would pour His Spirit out of upon the um Church there Amen on the day of Pentecost because this was the Fulfillment where where'd say now all this was done that it might be fulfilled we just spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying behold the Virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted as God With Us now we've got to look at the effect of this name when this name was ever spoken the first time this name was ever spoken through human lips what it did now the first time this name was ever spoken was after Mary Mary would would after she had this visitation she began to find herself with child she was told by the angel that that her cousin Elizabeth was with child as well now Elizabeth's child had never moved in the womb at this stage she was she was six months pregnant normally by that stage you you feel a lot of kicks even even husbands can feel a lot of kicks through the through the womb you know sometimes like just just give him some you know and you get a bit of a kick there you know but but by six months you should be feeling those things but Elizabeth never felt the baby move and to no doubt she was troubled by these things and then Mary comes her cousin comes running you know and and and visits her and she would make her salutation because no doubt they would greet each other and hug each other and you know Elizabeth was with child she knew she was expecting but then when she saw Mary she'd say Mary what happened to you I thought have you been married when was the wedding why did I get an invitation you know those kind of things but you know she'd say no no we're not um married yet and but so so she so Elizabeth was like oh well what's happened here what's going on and then and then Mary was like no no nothing like that happened I was I was going to get water from the well one day and it was like any other kind of a day but there was a man standing there in the way there was a different kind of atmosphere around him and he called me by name I don't know how he knew my name but he knew my name he said hell Mary and you know she's like what is going on here and then he would begin to quote promises that we had read earlier from the Scrolls of Isaiah those ones I heard in the synagogue that just spoke to my heart and now the angel has come to confirm his word and then he would say that I'm going to have the Messiah and and and and and and she you know I was puzzled by this I said well how can this be uh you know we're not married you know I'm not married to Joseph I don't know a man and you know but he'd say no the Holy Ghost is going to come and create the Messiah in your womb and you shall call his name Jesus and the first time that name was ever spoken through mortal lips amen the Holy Ghost fell upon Elizabeth and John began to jump for joy in the womb of his mother amen so now if the if the first time that name is spoke you think about how powerful this name is the first time this name was ever spoken a dead baby in a womb came to life and and also the Holy Ghost fell upon Elizabeth and she began to prophesy and praise God that was the first time that name was ever spoken through mortal lips upon the earth now if that was for a if that could do that to a dead baby in a mother's womb how much more a holy ghost-filled church ought to make it leap and jump for joy if we realize the power of that name what that name has done for you and I amen it hasn't just made us religious people it hasn't just given us a different kind of a church and while we believe this and our founder to listen no it doesn't hasn't given us that it's given us deliverance from sin amen deliverance from unbelief deliverance from you know from all temptation all trouble amen it's given us healing for our bodies healing for our minds amen it's redeemed us back to God Hallelujah add more to make us jump for joy that sacred precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that name is above all names Hallelujah no Jesus would give instructions because remember in that name is resurrection I mean that's why he could because remember he says I come in my father's name and you receive me not well what is the name of the father then Jesus but why because that's the highest name that God has given Hallelujah right of himself why because he's declaring all of his attributes in that name amen under the name of Jehovah there was no deliverance from sin there's just a blood covering to cover their sins by the blood of bulls and ghosts but they could not change their nature but under the name of Jesus Christ amen we can become New Creations you think about David David was an unusual believer really he would sit there and he would write Psalms as the heart paneth for the water Brooks oh my soul Longs after thee he says one thing I've decided I want to dwell in the house of the Lord forever he was king of Israel different things but he just had a longing Lord I want to be in your presence I want to walk into your courts I want to be where you are then you think about he had a longing that God would dwell in him basically but God could anoint him the spirit of God was with him but wasn't in him so he had a desire that he could never actually fulfill on that side of Calvary though remember all the saints of the Old Testament there they'll be in glory too right that's why those who died under the blood of bulls and goats and Faith they went to Paradise they were waiting right but their deed had to be cleared right the blood of bulls and goats cover their sin but something a blood a greater blood had to come to do it away and that's why the scripture says that he led captivity captive right so when Jesus when Jesus's body was in the Tomb a lot of things were going on what Jesus went down and preached to the souls in prison saying you should have listened to Noah because here I am right and then he went down further and he you know kicked in the door of hell and Satan's on his Lazy Boy chair and he thinks now I've got you now I thought I had you when I had Abel I thought I had you when I had no I thought I had you when I had a you know you know all the Believers down Through the Ages but now I know I've got you I thought I had you when I had John the Baptist surely I did but now I've got you but then actually Satan wasn't the one who got anyone God got him right because his blood was on the cross he had purchased the salvation of Adam's Fallen race for the sins of the world he he had died he says no Satan I'm in charge here now you ain't boss no give me the keys to hell death in the grave you act some other side boots him back down and then he ascends on high it's amazing you know we can be walking along in in utter despair and utter broken Ness because the disciples their whole life had fallen apart and now living in a season of Resurrection the Messiah had been crucified the ministry had shut themselves up in an upper room the one who's who Jesus said will be given the keys to the kingdom swore and denied the Lord so in his great trial he actually denied God did those things the the church treasurer had committed suicide the whole movement of falling apart but in an Unseen World God was giving the greatest Victory he'd ever gone I mean taking the keys he held it in the grave of Satan then he ascended up into paradise and all the Believers that are under the blood of bulls and goats they were under expectation for him to come and know that that you know they just spent all that time giving testimonies to when they saw him in their day Hallelujah then the door came open then he stepped in Hallelujah and then he empty Paradise why because the blood had been given to clear their clear their deed that they could Ascend up into Glory right amen so now so a lot of things can be happening up you know in the world and we just think life has just gone sideways and everything's bad because the disciples thought everything had gone bad but the greatest event in history they were living in and they didn't realize it that's why when Jesus appeared to clopidus and his friend on the road to Damascus you know he he was actually asking why are you sad why are you downcast why aren't you happy and here he was the resurrected triumphant Messiah was walking with them but but their eyes weren't open that they would know who he was and then so they were walking along and and and and and and and he asked that question why are you sad and they're and they're surprised what do you mean don't you know what just happened weren't you there the crucifixion do you not hear what just happened to Jesus of Nazareth we believe he was a prophet we believe he is the Messiah he was going to restore Israel do all these things and then Jesus who was walking with him said o fools and slow of hardness to believe and they started at Moses and went through all the scriptures pertaining himself no doubt all the prophecies all the types and the shadows and then when they came to the Village Emmaus they constrained him because he because it looked like he was going to walk on he said hold on come and eat with us and then he sat down and then he break the bread now apparently in the Jewish tradition the head of the house breaks the bread so he even though even before they realized who he was they actually gave him the head of the house they gave the chief seat at the table and then he broke the bread and their eyes came open why because he did something that he did before he went to Calvary because he broke the bread of the Loaves and Fishes different things their eyes came open when they did it when they saw a manifestation of what he did before amen and then they realized that the Messiah had risen and they were once said now they go run back into Jerusalem happy to tell the disciples who have seen him he's alive and they said didn't our hearts burn within us as he spake along the way now it's the same thing with us we've had a Ministry in the end time where the thoughts and hearts of the people have been discerned down to addresses what's wrong Vision scene the same Ministry of Jesus Christ has repeated in this end time he did something before he was crucified he's done again in the end time to show you I'm alive my name has power amen I'm here to gather you to to myself because you're living in a Resurrection season remember the two on the way to Emmaus Jesus went with them until they saw not just the resurrection had happened but they were part of that Resurrection amen because they had to go to the upper room where before that they were dead and trespasses and sins but now they're Alive by the new birth Hallelujah so he needed them to realize they were part of the Fulfillment of the Resurrection hour it's the same thing with you and I the Lord walks with us until we realize and he keeps walking after it don't get me wrong but he walks with you opening his word until you realize not just he's alive but I'm part of the Fulfillment of his word in this end time Hallelujah praise the Lord now we're kind of jumping around here now so now if if if his the first time his name is spoken gave gave a a dead baby life in a mother's womb and she was filled with the Holy Ghost how much more it should do to a holy ghost-filled church amen sir so now they were instructed they were instructed now in Luke 24. he says and then and then he opened their under um either understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffering to raise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations being beginning at Jerusalem so it all had to be done in his name and it's amazing now now it's not just that that's done in his name baptism is in his name right that's why because amazing people will pray in his name they will they will they'll ask for healing in his name guidance in his name but they'll never be called by his name amen and how you call by his name is that you're buried in his name in baptism to come forth in newness of life amen because that name is the name above all names as it's saying Philippians 2 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow things in heaven thinks in Earth and things under the Earth now I'm just gonna I feel like I'm just gonna skip a whole bunch of this because I want to come down to now what has this got to do with us and now we've come to um Jehovah um sabath what has this got to do with all that heaven is that you know we can access it's very important we realize who who we can have access to yeah right just as Jacob could wrestle with God when he recognized the ain't host of angels who are around him right he could rest with God and be changed we're going to recognize that we can get a hold of God that life can come forth why did Hannah pour a life out at the Tabernacle that life would come that Deliverance would a deliverable would come and judges or a prophet would come and open the word restore things how it should be bring a kingly line in that's why I've got to realize the one we can come to can give us life right not just natural life of a baby which is all perfectly well but eternal life God's own life now he after he arose he became our high priest right Jesus Christ is our high priest he ever liveth to maketh intercession for us amen for you and I he is Intercity on your behalf right so he is now the high priest of as as as brother Brown will put it of his own word so he is there to intercede that his his own word would be fulfilled right now but the thing is his word can never be fulfilled in our lives until we confess that he has not only done it but he can do it right it's absolutely important that we do not confess unbelief but we confess the promises of God well because if you think about it when Jesus was on when when Jesus was talking to pilate he says I could call my Father in heaven and he could send 12 Legions of angels right so there were 12 Legions of angels now I didn't do the math but it's a lot of angels one could have done the whole job one could have annihilated all the Romans could have wiped out all the Sanhedrin could have leveled the whole place one could have done it but he could have called 12 Legions of angels but you see those angels were there at attention they were ready to move but Jesus had to give the command amen just like all that heaven is it's all at your attention just like the king would say to Esther what do you have need of I'll give you give you even a up to half the kingdom or make you call um co-ruler in other words you know so so so what do you have need of what is your request all of Heaven is there but you've got to call for it what is your need today amen because remember he's the high priest of our profession amen so so and and that word profession means a confession so he will his hands are Heaven is tied Heaven's hands are tied until you speak life and death is in the power of the tongue right eternal life isn't the power of the tongue amen right this thing's very powerful but you need to speak to God and and and quote his promises and take him at his word that heaven can come and be dispensed on your behalf amen that's why it's so important because those that call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved right but first you've got to call upon the name of the Lord what's the name Lord Jesus save me help me right so he's there as a savior be a call upon him and he saves you amen so he is he is all there you say well why do we bother with this whole service this morning I just I'm just going to wrap it up with this because I think some people are very underwhelmed but that's fine All That Heaven is is at your disposal God can do anything he wants but he's waiting for you he has partnered his his salvation plan with man he works through man he could have got the Sun the moon the stars the trees the birds the preacher's gospel but he's got you to be a living witness right so all of Heaven is behind the believer even before you became a Believer God was watching over you brooding over your life drawing you to himself that's why any religious experience you had before you came to the truth God used God was working in there right he was gathering you through it wasn't in vain he was doing something in your life right but you see now now because he's tied his plan to you you had to speak you have to go on prayer right because he's because he can't do anything until you call for it right and we are not just calling upon a god or just Jesus as in the world wants to make him just this little Aaron boy and he died on the cross and no he's more than that he is the Lord Of Glory you think that we can come into the presence of the almighty God amen his blood means we're coming to his Almighty presence the one who made all things who made every atom every molecule every piece of matter that man can identify he made it all right and we can come into His presence and talk to him like the Angels can't talk to him because we are his children amen I think it's immensely powerful he said well that's Elementary no we must never ever diminish the one we talk to amen because he's the all-powerful almighty Lord Jesus Christ who has come to deliver us in this time of trouble just like he would do see why did see see Jeremiah would preach and say the Lord of hosts sayeth this a different things so as the world was going I mean as Israel was going into destruction he says basically all of Heaven is can be at your disposal if you call upon him if you repent of your sins come back to him all of Heaven is there for you the world has gone into is going into a judgment cycle right so all of Heaven is here that we can call upon say Lord we have needs we have family that needs saving friends loved ones we've got sick among us troubles aren't you know we need direction whatever it is you can call upon him and he'll give you whatever you have need of that his name would be glorified amen praise the Lord if that's how the musician's place this morning but his name is above all names hey man only glad you can call upon him hey man let's um let's stand this morning I mean let's um let's let's sing that
