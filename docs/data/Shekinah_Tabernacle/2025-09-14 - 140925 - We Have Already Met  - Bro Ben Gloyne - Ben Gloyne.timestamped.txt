[6:55] Good morning.
[6:58] How are you this morning? You good?
[7:01] happy.
[7:04] I'll tell you a little story. Want to
[7:06] hear a little story?
[7:11] &gt;&gt; I got dragged along to an All Blacks
[7:13] game last night.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Like I I couldn't Okay, I couldn't
[7:20] really care less about rugby. I'm a
[7:21] little bit too wise to see your value in
[7:27] see the point in sport, right? apart
[7:29] from you get fit. It it it's a but young
[7:32] fellas quite enjoy, you know, stuff like
[7:35] that. So, I thought I'll just I'll have
[7:37] a little bit of fun. So, I um got a
[7:41] South African jersey off um brother Ed
[7:43] and I thought I'll go as a South African
[7:45] supporter, you know, just because
[7:49] why not? Let's have some fun,
[7:51] make it half enjoyable for me. And I but
[7:55] you know I was I went there in that and
[7:57] and as I was walking in I thought this
[7:59] is kind of strange because I'm I'm I've
[8:00] got this jersey on and I'm going to walk
[8:02] in as something that's not really in my
[8:04] heart you know and so when the South
[8:05] Africans score a try I'm going to stand
[8:07] up and go yeah
[8:10] and and if the All Blacks get a try I'm
[8:12] going to say oh boo and I I'll play the
[8:15] part I'll have the jersey I'll pretend
[8:17] I'm that but in my heart I I will know
[8:20] that's not actually me. like in my heart
[8:22] I'm from this place and and those other
[8:24] people on the other team are actually my
[8:26] people then you could say they're sort
[8:28] of like my family you know that that's
[8:30] that's who I know and you know I thought
[8:32] it it struck me I thought you know isn't
[8:34] it the same with a someone that's a son
[8:37] or a daughter of God you might go out in
[8:39] the world and might do things and put on
[8:41] a different look and look look a bit
[8:43] different and try and pretend you're
[8:44] into this thing but really in your heart
[8:46] you belong to the Lord and you you might
[8:48] cheer for that team and all that stuff
[8:50] but you you're never really into do it
[8:52] in your heart. You know, you know what?
[8:53] I actually don't belong on this side. I
[8:55] belong on the other side. I belong with
[8:57] the Lord. That's actually my team. No
[8:59] matter how much I try and pretend it,
[9:01] put the outfit on, do all the stuff,
[9:02] man, it's not really my team, you know.
[9:05] So, I'm glad that we're all sons and

[36:56] into the river
[36:59] I will wait
[37:02] where my sins
[37:04] are washed away
[37:07] from the heavens

[38:49] Hallelujah.
[38:51] Are you glad for that? Amen. He's the
[38:54] same yesterday, today, and forever
[38:55] alive, forever more. Amen. Thank you,
[38:57] musicians. God bless you. Amen. Thank
[38:59] you for the special, brother. God bless
[39:01] you, brother Mo. Appreciate that. Amen.
[39:04] It's great to have Adam here. God bless
[39:06] you, bro. Just feel at home, buddy. God
[39:07] bless you. Welcome. Amen. God bless you.
[39:10] Amy, good to have everyone else here,
[39:11] too. Amen. Let's um turn in the
[39:13] scripture um to we're going to go to
[39:16] Genesis uh chapter 24.
[39:30] I mean, I trust everyone's well today.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Everyone's good, happy. Amen. Just going
[39:36] to
[39:38] read here from Genesis 24 and verses
[39:41] 61-65. So,
[39:48] Amen. And Genesis 24:61-65
[39:51] says, "And Rebecca arose in her damsels,
[39:53] and they rode upon the camels and
[39:55] followed the man, and the servant took
[39:57] her Rebecca and went his way. And Isaac
[39:59] came from the well uh from the way of
[40:02] the of the well, Laarori, uh for he
[40:05] dwelt in the south country." And Isaac
[40:07] went out to meditate in the field at the
[40:09] evening tide, and lifted up his eyes,
[40:10] and saw, and behold, the camels were
[40:12] coming. And Rebecca lifted up her eyes,
[40:14] and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off
[40:16] the camel, for she had said unto the
[40:18] servant, "What man is this that walketh
[40:19] in the field to meet us?" And the
[40:21] servant had said, "It is my master."
[40:23] Therefore, she took a veil and covered
[40:25] herself. Amen. Then we're just going to
[40:28] go to um 1 Peter 1 and:es 3-9. Um
[40:33] probably one of my favorite I mean, I
[40:35] got a lot of favorites, but this I
[40:36] really like this passage, this this
[40:38] piece of scripture here.
[40:43] I mean so first Peter 1 and 3-9
[40:47] reads here it says
[40:50] said blessed be the God and father of
[40:51] our Lord Jesus Christ which hath which
[40:54] according to his abundant mercy hath
[40:56] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[40:58] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[41:00] the dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[41:02] and undefiled that fadeth not away
[41:04] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[41:07] by the power of God through faith under
[41:09] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[41:11] last time. Ruin ye greatly rejoice,
[41:13] though now for a season if need be, you
[41:15] are in heaviness through manifold
[41:17] temptations, that the trial of your
[41:19] faith being much more precious than of
[41:20] gold, that perisheth, though it be tried
[41:22] with fire, might be found into the
[41:24] praise and honor and glory at the
[41:26] appearing of Jesus Christ, whom having
[41:28] not seen uh ye love, in whom though now
[41:32] ye see him not, yet believing, ye
[41:34] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[41:36] glory, receiving the end of your faith,
[41:39] even the salvation of your souls. Amen.
[41:42] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[41:43] this morning. If you have a need, you
[41:45] just want to slip your hand up. Say,
[41:46] "Lord, remember me this day. Don't pass
[41:47] me by. Lord, I want a personal meeting
[41:49] with you today. Oh, almighty God, as we
[41:52] bow our heads and our hearts in your
[41:53] presence, Lord, we just want to praise
[41:55] your great name, give you glory, Lord.
[41:56] We want to lift up your name, Lord,
[41:58] because your name is a name above all
[41:59] names." I just want to pray and ask,
[42:02] Lord, would you come our way today?
[42:05] Would you come by all of our lives,
[42:06] touch our lives, Lord? Father, meet
[42:08] every need, dear God. Father, if we're
[42:10] lost, Lord, may we be no longer lost by
[42:12] the end of the service, Lord. We haven't
[42:14] given our lives to you, Lord. If we need
[42:16] a touch from you, Lord, maybe a
[42:18] stronghold needs to be broken. A healing
[42:19] needs to take place, Lord, to refill
[42:22] with your spirit or even to receive it,
[42:23] Lord. May you grant it this service,
[42:25] have your way, dear God. I just want to
[42:26] plead your blood over our lives and not
[42:28] only us here, but those who may be
[42:29] streaming, Lord, have your way. We love
[42:31] you so much. We commit our lives into
[42:33] your hands, Lord. We especially want to
[42:35] remember brother Phil at this time,
[42:36] Lord, as you continue to touch him and
[42:38] raise him up for your glory. Lord, we
[42:40] commit him. We commit our lives into
[42:41] your hands, Lord. But pray you bless the
[42:43] reading of your word, which we've just
[42:44] done in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[42:49] have your seats um this morning. So, I
[42:51] want to take if I could take a title uh
[42:53] this morning. This is a phrase or I
[42:55] think um Christy and I were talking
[42:56] about this or can't remember where it
[42:58] came up exactly but you know when we go
[43:00] and meet the Lord it's not like we're
[43:02] meeting someone for the first time.
[43:04] Okay, we've actually met him already.
[43:06] You know there can be a lot of um people
[43:08] can think well you know what's it going
[43:10] to be like? Am I going to is he going to
[43:11] accept me? Is he going to welcome me,
[43:14] you know, in in open arms, you know, up
[43:16] into glory? You know, what's it going to
[43:17] be like? You know, the when we leave
[43:19] this world, go to the next world. Who's
[43:21] had those kind of thoughts? You know,
[43:22] what's he what's his attitude going to
[43:24] be like towards me? What's it going to
[43:26] be? You know, is it going to be awkward?
[43:28] Is it going to be, you know, is he going
[43:30] to ignore me? You know, is he going to
[43:32] accept me? Well, the beautiful thing is
[43:35] we've already met. Okay, so this is the
[43:38] whole thing. The Lord Jesus is, you
[43:40] know, his spirit is upon the earth and
[43:42] the believer already knows him. Amen.
[43:44] It's not like we're going to be meeting
[43:45] him for the first time. But no, we're
[43:47] actually well we you should be well
[43:49] acquainted with him on this side. Amen.
[43:51] Because we know that the scripture says
[43:53] to know him is eternal life. Amen. To to
[43:55] know him as life, not just to know about
[43:57] him, to be able to quote his word from
[43:59] Genesis to Revelation or all the message
[44:01] backwards and frontwards. You know, the
[44:03] devil can do that, but he doesn't know
[44:04] the Lord. I mean, he isn't he hasn't
[44:06] become one with our Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:07] No sir, he can't do it. But you see the
[44:09] believer now, you know, we've already
[44:11] met.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that should take all fear away
[44:14] or worry, you know, because if he's
[44:15] received you here, he's going to receive
[44:16] you there cuz he's already received you
[44:18] here. Amen. So you as we read here in um
[44:22] Peter here, it says, you know, having
[44:24] not seen you love in whom though you now
[44:26] see him not, yet believing you rejoice
[44:28] with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[44:31] Now you say, how on earth could you love
[44:33] someone you've never met? Well, the
[44:35] Christians already met him.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you really meet the Lord,
[44:38] when he fills you with his Holy Ghost,
[44:39] he changes your life. You've met him.
[44:41] Amen. Or rather, he's met you. He's
[44:43] changed your life. He's got a hold of
[44:45] your life. There's a whole different
[44:46] walk that you're walking now. Now, we
[44:49] read here about Rebecca and you know the
[44:51] story of as as as Abraham would um
[44:53] Abraham was um you know, he needed a son
[44:55] for his um for sorry, he needed a wife
[44:58] for a son, Isaac. And um he he sent
[45:00] Eleazar, the main servant there of his
[45:03] of his household. And he and he
[45:05] commissioned him, go find a bride for
[45:06] Isaac. And so now here here Rebecca had
[45:09] no idea. She was just living her life
[45:11] and doing what she did. And but she had
[45:13] no idea. But she was tied in with
[45:14] prophecy that her life was more than
[45:16] just, you know, her family, her mom and
[45:18] dad, her siblings, or whoever she had
[45:20] around her and the things she was
[45:22] facing. But it was far deeper than that.
[45:24] And that God God had already ordained
[45:26] her life that she would actually leave
[45:28] all she knew and come into a different
[45:30] land. Amen. into into a land of uh of of
[45:33] the resurrection. Amen. Because you know
[45:35] that promised land is where is where the
[45:37] resurrection will take place. And we
[45:38] know our promised land is the Holy
[45:40] Ghost. Amen. Is the word that you know
[45:42] that is the place of resurrection for
[45:44] us. And so she would be there by the
[45:46] well. And she had no idea that Eleazar
[45:48] was sent with all the wealth of um of of
[45:50] Abraham to find, you know, Isaac a
[45:53] bride. And here she was. And you know,
[45:54] he would he would be by the he would
[45:56] come to where he was sent to go cuz he
[45:58] was told to go to his um told to go to
[46:01] Abraham's kindred there. And you know,
[46:03] she had no idea that before he got to
[46:05] the well, she was uh he was praying
[46:07] that, you know, may the damsel that
[46:09] comes and gives water to me and to my
[46:10] camels, may she be the one. She had no
[46:13] idea this had all transpired. She had no
[46:15] idea that, you know, Abraham told
[46:17] Eleazar before before Eleazar was sent
[46:20] that Abraham said, "The angel of the
[46:21] Lord will go before you." Amen. That
[46:24] that that he will cause what you've been
[46:26] sent to do to be accomplished. And you
[46:27] know, and we live in a day where the
[46:29] angel of the Lord is has come to the
[46:31] earth, amen, to what? To call a bride
[46:33] for Jesus Christ. Amen. To me, it's a
[46:36] wonderful thing. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:38] Where where where God would send a
[46:40] message, amen, into this earth to find a
[46:42] bride. And so, she finds herself
[46:46] giving him water, giving the camels
[46:48] water. and she had no idea she was
[46:50] actually living out the prayer of
[46:52] Eleaza.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Then they have the conversation and you
[46:55] know she uh she's given gifts by by
[46:58] Eleaza. She goes and tells her family.
[47:00] Then they have a big talk about the you
[47:03] know the ministry of Eleaza why he's
[47:04] sent to find a bride for Isaac. And then
[47:06] finally, finally there's the, you know,
[47:08] there's the question is uh given and
[47:11] this is before these verses where where
[47:13] Rebecca um is asked the question, will
[47:15] you go with this man? You know, and and
[47:18] she says, I will go. She had to make a
[47:21] decision. It wasn't a family thing. It
[47:23] was her own personal decision. I'm going
[47:25] to follow. Now, you just think about
[47:27] this. Here's a guy just turns up. He's
[47:29] got men with him. He's got camels. He's
[47:31] got wealth. She has no idea uh really
[47:35] his background, you know, he just here's
[47:38] this guy. Oh yeah, I work for Abraham
[47:40] and we're related, all these things. But
[47:42] turns up has no idea where she's going
[47:44] to be taken. Has no idea, you know,
[47:46] really. Would you do that? You know,
[47:49] here comes someone. Hey, you're actually
[47:52] part of this family. I want to take you
[47:53] over here. And you know, it doesn't
[47:55] really even, you know, just Would you do
[47:58] that? I say you've done it. Amen. Amen.
[48:00] If you've accepted the Lord Jesus
[48:01] Christ, if God has if you have made a
[48:03] full surrender, he's transformed your
[48:04] life by his Holy Ghost, you've made that
[48:06] decision.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, because the same faith she had
[48:09] is the same faith that we had because we
[48:12] travel. You got to realize when you when
[48:13] you leave the things of this world,
[48:15] you're walking into a world you know
[48:16] nothing about.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of God, the reality of
[48:20] the blood. Amen. to walk in the word
[48:21] that that you know even for the fact
[48:23] that the Bible is more than a history
[48:24] book or a you know it's more than a book
[48:26] of you know nice you know nice way of
[48:28] living but it's a book of prophecy amen
[48:30] and it's and we're living in Bible days
[48:32] that's a whole new land that you know
[48:34] before you enter into it you think man
[48:36] where am I going it's a totally alien
[48:38] place we here this morning I trust you
[48:41] know it's all good and so so but but she
[48:43] decided that she was going to go and the
[48:45] same faith she had was the same faith
[48:47] that actually Abraham had because
[48:48] Abraham was called to leave his kindred,
[48:50] leave his um leave his family, and he
[48:52] was told, "I'm going to God told him,
[48:54] I'm going to take you to a place that
[48:56] you're going to inherit." But he would
[48:57] he would be called out into a place that
[48:59] he should after receive for an
[49:01] inheritance. He obeyed and he went out
[49:03] knowing not whether he went. So, he
[49:05] didn't know really where he was going.
[49:07] It's like, you know, you know, he's
[49:08] packing up his camels, packing up Sarah
[49:10] on the camel and all these things. His
[49:11] neighbors lean over the fence and say,
[49:13] "Abraham, where are you going?" Uh, and
[49:16] you know, you going down the street,
[49:17] better house here. He says, "Uh, no, I'm
[49:19] leaving this town." Well, where are you
[49:20] going? I have no idea. You would be kind
[49:23] of questioning that guy's leadership.
[49:25] Right? But it was God leading him. Amen.
[49:28] The spirit of the Lord called him out.
[49:29] Amen. So, he went he went to a place he
[49:32] did not know. And the same thing with
[49:33] Rebecca cuz the same faith in Abraham
[49:35] was the same faith in Rebecca. Okay. I
[49:39] trust this is amen. So, so here they
[49:41] would leave now. Now, but you see the
[49:44] thing is as as Rebecca was going with
[49:47] Eleaza, you know, she would no doubt be
[49:50] asking a lot of questions. Who is this
[49:53] man that I am? Who is this man that I'm
[49:55] going to marry? You know, wouldn't that
[49:56] be a Wouldn't that you know, women like
[49:59] details?
[50:01] They like details. Okay. Yes. You know,
[50:03] so she'd be asking him, "What does he
[50:05] like? What is he what's his personality
[50:08] like? all the things that because she's
[50:10] already said she's going to go, but then
[50:12] you know um she needs to find out who
[50:15] she's who she's marrying. Okay. So, the
[50:18] thing is by the time that the camel
[50:20] train came into where Abra um to to
[50:22] where Isaac was actually Rebecca by the
[50:25] words of Eleaza already knew Isaac.
[50:28] Amen. Because remember God and his word
[50:30] is the same.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; I mean you can't separate God and his
[50:33] word they are the same being. I mean, so
[50:35] Eleaza was not drawing Rebecca to
[50:38] himself. No, a true servant will point
[50:40] the people to a real walk with the Lord
[50:42] Jesus Christ. And so now, as Ele was
[50:44] Eleazing, Amen. What did it do? It
[50:47] caused her to fall in love with Isaac
[50:49] that when they finally met, it was love
[50:51] at first sight. Amen. But she, as she
[50:53] was going on this journey, she, you
[50:55] know, and then she met Isaac, she would
[50:57] have realized, I've already met him
[51:00] through the words of Eleazar. Amen. It's
[51:02] the same thing with the message of the
[51:03] hour. What does it do? It introduces us
[51:05] to Jesus Christ. Amen. That we've that
[51:07] that we already meet him. Praise the
[51:10] Lord. I mean, I'm so glad that I'm not
[51:12] wondering what's he going to be like
[51:13] over that other side. No, I know his
[51:15] presence. I know his attitude. I know
[51:17] his word. I mean, not in here, but in my
[51:19] heart. I mean, I know what he likes. I
[51:21] know what what he is like. I mean, and
[51:23] I'm not interested in his outward
[51:24] appearance. I don't care if he's tall,
[51:26] short, fat, thin, blue, black, purple,
[51:28] yellow. I don't care what color he is.
[51:30] But he's the Messiah. Amen. And I love
[51:32] him. Amen. Because why? We fall in love
[51:34] with him here. The union takes place
[51:37] here. The marriage takes place here. We
[51:39] go to the supper there.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] Praise the Lord. And so now, what does
[51:47] this do? Now, we fall in love with this.
[51:48] You say, "Well, how could a Christian is
[51:50] a crazy person? They've never met
[51:51] Jesus." Well, we have. He said, "I will
[51:54] be with you, even in you to the end of
[51:55] the world." Amen. The world won't see me
[51:57] no more, but yet ye shall see me. Amen.
[51:59] So, those who are the believer actually,
[52:01] they see the Lord. Amen. We what you say
[52:03] have you seen nail scarred hands and
[52:05] prints and no I haven't seen his
[52:06] physical body will meet that in the air
[52:08] but his spirit his word is upon the
[52:10] earth and I meet him that way. Amen.
[52:13] Praise the Lord. And so what does it do?
[52:15] It gives us it gives us joy unspeakable.
[52:18] We rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[52:20] of glory. Amen. Because we're not
[52:22] walking this walk with fear and
[52:24] trepidation. No, he's taken away all the
[52:26] fear. Amen. He has taken away all the
[52:28] fear. All the you know we known whom we
[52:30] have believed. Amen. We have full
[52:32] confidence that what he has started he
[52:34] will complete. Amen. He doesn't do a
[52:36] halfway job. Amen. He never sure we will
[52:39] go through disappointments but we won't
[52:41] be disappointed in him. Amen. Because
[52:43] when we come to a place and realize he's
[52:45] our great shepherd. Amen. That he is not
[52:47] just casually you know sending us off
[52:50] into the wilderness trying to find our
[52:51] way. But we know the way. Amen. He says
[52:54] I am the way the truth and the life.
[52:56] Where we can have such confidence God
[52:58] I'm never out of your care.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:01] Amen. Yeah. It's like um well, I'll just
[53:04] put this in here. It says, you know,
[53:05] receiving the end of your faith, even
[53:07] the salvation of your souls. And that
[53:09] word end, it means to set out of a a
[53:12] definite point or goal properly. The
[53:13] point aimed at, I mean, the conclusion
[53:15] of an act or state. Amen. So the so the
[53:18] receiving the end of our faith is it's
[53:19] come to its conclusion. It's come to
[53:21] we're secure. Amen. It's not a partial
[53:24] thing. No, it's a full reality. Amen.
[53:26] Why? Cuz we're sealed to the day of our
[53:28] redemption.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; I believe in eternal security. If you're
[53:31] in Christ, you're eternally secure.
[53:32] Amen. You'll have your ups and downs,
[53:34] your troubles, but God will see you
[53:36] through all of them. Amen. Even, you
[53:38] know, people like like Fanny Crosby
[53:40] would be asked, you know, you know, she
[53:42] was a singer and, you know, you know,
[53:43] she was a gospel writer and they people
[53:45] tried to come to her and get her to sell
[53:47] her gift to the world to make a bunch of
[53:48] money, but she refused to do it because
[53:50] she realized the gift in her life was
[53:52] God-given. And all she wanted to do was
[53:54] glorify God in her life. Amen. And
[53:57] that's what a Christian does is all
[53:58] they're interested is glorifying Jesus
[54:00] Christ. Amen. So they would ask her, you
[54:02] know, you're blind and you know, you
[54:04] know, you know, when you get to heaven,
[54:06] if there is such a place, how would you
[54:07] ever know him? She says, I'll know him.
[54:09] I'll know him. She stayed on God's word.
[54:11] And when those men turned to leave, she
[54:13] started through the house with her hands
[54:14] up. The spirit struck her and she sang,
[54:16] "I shall know him. Yes, I shall know
[54:18] him. And redeemed by his side, I shall
[54:20] stand. I shall know him by the prince of
[54:22] the nails in his hand. If I can't see in
[54:23] heaven, I'll know him by the prince of
[54:25] the nails in his hand. I mean, she had
[54:27] such an assurance cuz I know him now,
[54:29] I'll know him there. Amen. So, she
[54:31] wasn't worried about, you know, well,
[54:33] you know, if I can't see in heaven,
[54:35] well, I'll know him there. And to me,
[54:37] the fact is when you really meet the
[54:38] Lord, that sweet presence of God, you
[54:41] become very acquainted with, right? You
[54:43] become to realize what anger and
[54:45] jealousy and malice is. And then you
[54:47] know the opposite of what love, peace,
[54:49] joy, comfort, care, stability,
[54:52] reassurance. You know what that is.
[54:53] Amen. Amen. So you know the true
[54:55] presence of God. And the problem is this
[54:57] world has come to a place where the
[54:59] spirit of God is very lean. Amen. It's
[55:01] not in a lot of places sadly. So it's
[55:03] all fussing and fighting and debate as
[55:05] opposed to where's God in the matter. I
[55:07] mean, because when people get into a
[55:08] political fussing, fighting kind of a
[55:11] spirit, there's not that sweet
[55:12] gentleness no more. It leaves sadly.
[55:14] That's why we always got to stay
[55:16] separate from those things and just walk
[55:18] with that sweet humble feeling.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; You know, you should know the presence
[55:22] of God. You say, "Well, you going by
[55:24] feelings." No, that's what his word
[55:26] produces. Amen. His word produces love.
[55:29] His word produces joy. His word produces
[55:32] peace. Amen. His word produces faith.
[55:34] Amen. His word produces meekness,
[55:36] temperance, and all those things, does
[55:37] it not? Amen. When his word comes into
[55:39] you and lives, it produces those things.
[55:42] Amen. So now the thing is that because
[55:44] we know his presence here, we'll know
[55:46] him over there.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't step into his presence
[55:50] and it'll be a totally different kind of
[55:51] an atmosphere. It should be a far
[55:53] greater one.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like this here. If I could I
[55:57] could find this. This really blessed me
[55:58] yesterday.
[56:00] Um he says he says so from revelations
[56:02] 21 1-4 he says I saw a new heaven a new
[56:05] earth for the first he uh heaven and the
[56:07] first earth were passed away and there
[56:09] was no more sea and I John saw the holy
[56:11] city new Jerusalem coming down from God
[56:13] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[56:15] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[56:17] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[56:18] the tabernacle of God is with men and he
[56:21] will dwell with them and they shall be
[56:22] his people and God himself shall be with
[56:24] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[56:27] away all their tears from their eyes and
[56:28] there shall be no more death, neither
[56:30] sorrow nor crying. Neither shall there
[56:32] be any more pain. For the former things
[56:34] are passed away. How wonderful. All of
[56:36] God's wonderful promises fulfilled. It
[56:38] will be all over. The change uh will
[56:41] have been completed. The lamb and his
[56:44] bride forever settled in all the
[56:46] perfections of God. Describe it. Who is
[56:48] able to do that? No one. Think about it,
[56:50] dream about it, read the word says about
[56:52] it. Yes, we can do all of that. Yet we
[56:55] can only know an infantessimal part of
[56:57] it until it becomes reality in the first
[56:59] resurrection. Amen. So we just have a
[57:02] small infantessimal part of it. You feel
[57:03] the prince of God. You're in a powerful
[57:05] service maybe camp or somewhere God
[57:07] moves. You're praying and the presence
[57:08] of God comes out. It's almost it's
[57:10] overwhelming sometimes just how great he
[57:12] is. And that's just a small
[57:13] infantessible part of the great reality.
[57:17] Amen. Of of what we're going to step
[57:19] into in the first resurrection when the
[57:20] dead in Christ rise and our bodies are
[57:22] changed. Amen. So it's not it's not
[57:24] something different. It must be far
[57:25] greater than what we're experiencing
[57:27] because at the moment we're limited by
[57:29] these by these bodies. That's why we
[57:32] need a body change. Amen. But you see
[57:34] it'll come to a place as it says as
[57:37] brother says here it says all the he
[57:39] says he says where all the change will
[57:42] be has been completed. Amen. So the
[57:45] change has already begun in our souls.
[57:46] God comes and dwells in our soul.
[57:48] There's a change there from from
[57:50] unbelief to faith. Right. But then now
[57:52] we're still in these bodies, still with
[57:53] these human spirits. But then those
[57:55] bodies will be changed. Praise the Lord.
[57:58] And then we'll see him as he is. Amen.
[58:00] Up in up in glory when we're taken up
[58:01] there to meet the Lord in the air. And
[58:03] you know all those things. But you see,
[58:05] it's it's only a small infantessimal
[58:08] part of what we're experiencing right
[58:09] now. I'm so thankful. Amen. There's far
[58:11] more. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[58:15] So Rebecca would Rebecca would be on
[58:18] this journey now. She would she would
[58:20] come to realize that this one that is
[58:22] being told her about
[58:25] amen is far greater and is really the
[58:28] one that she's been looking for all of
[58:29] her life. And it's the same thing with
[58:32] you and I. I trust you've had the
[58:33] experience where you've realized this
[58:35] word is different.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a lot of would have been
[58:38] a lot of other eligible bachelors around
[58:40] where she lived, but Isaac was
[58:42] different. Amen. He was a different kind
[58:44] of a man.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this Lord Jesus that we sow
[58:47] now. So, so love and know. Amen. He's
[58:50] different from every other religion.
[58:51] He's not even a religion. We don't
[58:53] follow a religion, a system of system of
[58:55] man. We re we follow Jesus Christ, the
[58:58] living God.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may have a lot of things that
[59:00] look like religion, but this is not a
[59:02] religion. A systematic way of just
[59:04] following God. No, this is a
[59:05] relationship.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then we come to
[59:14] realize now I just want to maybe just
[59:16] this is the whole thing that really
[59:17] blessed me but it's okay.
[59:20] We are never out of the shepherd's care.
[59:23] As I said we are we have already met.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. We've already met. God becomes
[59:29] more real than our own lives. Amen.
[59:32] Where he you know he is not a distant
[59:35] onlooker in life. You know sometimes we
[59:37] look at the world we think how on earth
[59:39] is God ever on the throne. We look at
[59:41] the chaos of this world. We see, you
[59:43] know, Charlie Kirk was assassinated this
[59:45] week and, you know, just trying to, you
[59:47] know, push, you know, push a
[59:48] conservative view and free speech in a
[59:51] dialogue. He got assassinated by a guy
[59:52] got radicalized online who was actually
[59:55] raised in a Christian environment. You
[59:57] see, but you see the whole point of the
[1:00:00] sadly the whole this whole thing is
[1:00:02] America eating itself alive. Amen. This
[1:00:05] world is devouring itself. Amen. It's
[1:00:07] the same. I know I've said it before,
[1:00:08] but it's the same if you look at the
[1:00:10] history of, you know, the Jewish nation
[1:00:12] from when they rejected Jesus Christ to
[1:00:14] when Titus came and destroyed Jerusalem.
[1:00:16] I mean, that that span of time is
[1:00:18] repeating itself right now. I mean,
[1:00:21] where there's different, you know, in
[1:00:22] the Jewish factions back there, you
[1:00:24] know, there were different there were
[1:00:24] the Zealots, there were the Pharisees,
[1:00:26] there different ones, there were all
[1:00:28] these Jewish factions there trying to
[1:00:30] make Israel great again. We've heard
[1:00:32] that phrase before, haven't we? trying
[1:00:34] to trying to bring in Jewish
[1:00:36] nationalism, trying to raise back what
[1:00:38] they you know what they thought Israel
[1:00:40] should be. But Israel was meant to be
[1:00:43] walking with the Messiah. I mean, so the
[1:00:45] believers in the book of Acts, they were
[1:00:46] what Israel was meant to be. I mean, one
[1:00:49] with the Almighty God. You see, but what
[1:00:51] happened is because they rejected
[1:00:52] Messiah, they brought religious,
[1:00:53] political views together and it brought
[1:00:56] the destruction of Jerusalem
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; like Jesus said would happen. Right? So
[1:01:00] everything you see in America going on,
[1:01:02] don't take sides with none of it. We're
[1:01:04] not called to to to be pulled to
[1:01:06] anything. We're meant to walk down the
[1:01:08] middle and show people there is a better
[1:01:10] way.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, you tie in
[1:01:12] politics and Christianity, it's going to
[1:01:14] it ends up with the image for the beast
[1:01:15] which is already there. Amen. It just
[1:01:17] brings in Satan and causes destruction.
[1:01:20] So we're not called to Sure. It's sad he
[1:01:22] died. He said a lot of good things. He
[1:01:24] probably helped a lot of good PO, but
[1:01:26] it's a tragedy. But it's a it's a result
[1:01:29] of America rejecting Christ and just
[1:01:32] taking swapping Christ for religion.
[1:01:35] It's a sad picture, right?
[1:01:38] Don't get caught up in it.
[1:01:41] Remember we have been to him that
[1:01:43] overcometh in this day you'll be given
[1:01:45] is to see right and gold tried in the
[1:01:49] fire. Later you see an age. Okay. The
[1:01:52] the Isav is free but the white robes
[1:01:55] come with a cost and that cost is
[1:01:57] separation. Brother Brandham speaks
[1:01:59] about it. So if you want those white
[1:02:00] robes stay don't let your spirit become
[1:02:03] entangled by whatever is trending. Amen.
[1:02:06] Cuz even like social media is actually
[1:02:07] designed to divide and it has divided.
[1:02:10] Amen. It was meant to bring people
[1:02:11] together but it's just polarized the
[1:02:12] whole world. Everyone's been transformed
[1:02:14] or deformed into a troll. You know
[1:02:16] saying what they want, doing all these
[1:02:18] kind of things. Don't get caught up in
[1:02:19] that stuff. Amen. We are we are in the
[1:02:22] world but not of this world.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how close it comes to
[1:02:25] home with what's going on and how how
[1:02:28] relatable it can be to you. Don't be
[1:02:30] caught up in it.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish
[1:02:32] believer there before Jerusalem's
[1:02:34] destroyed and you know your neighbors
[1:02:36] are are Jews as well, but they just
[1:02:37] don't see that Jesus is the Christ. They
[1:02:39] can't see the message of the hour. Amen.
[1:02:41] But they're being caught up into this
[1:02:42] thing because they're sincere people.
[1:02:44] They want to improve their nation. They
[1:02:46] want to be free and all these things.
[1:02:48] They want their own rights. But you see,
[1:02:49] they're being caught up in that and the
[1:02:50] pressure they try and put on you.
[1:02:53] Hey, hey, Isaac. Hey, hey, Abraham. I'm
[1:02:55] just picking a Jewish name. Hey, Levi.
[1:02:58] You got to take sides with us, man. Look
[1:03:00] at the economy. It's this this Roman
[1:03:01] system. Look at what they're doing to
[1:03:03] us. Look, they're destroying our nation,
[1:03:05] man. We're going to rally. We're going
[1:03:06] to we're going to make Israel great
[1:03:08] again. You're a Jew. You're obligated to
[1:03:10] this thing, but you're a believer.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; There would still be a pressure, but you
[1:03:15] got to realize, no, I've left. I'm here
[1:03:18] but I've left. I'm living in a different
[1:03:20] world.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm now I'm not of this world
[1:03:23] anymore.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, they would have had to stand
[1:03:26] against the pressure to take sides in
[1:03:28] that day. Now, how about you and I I'm
[1:03:30] taking sides with Jesus,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; the revealed word. I'm taking sides with
[1:03:34] my shepherd.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz my shepherd said, "You're in
[1:03:37] the world but not of the world." Amen.
[1:03:39] Or you say, "Well, I you know, if I if I
[1:03:41] join up with them, they might listen to
[1:03:42] what I have to say about the Lord." No,
[1:03:45] they'll be caught up in their thing.
[1:03:47] They have to be called out.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But do you see now? So during this
[1:03:53] very So we live in a complex time.
[1:03:55] Brother Bram says about how you know
[1:03:56] every church age finishes with to him
[1:03:58] that have an ear, let him hear what the
[1:04:00] voice says to the churches, right?
[1:04:01] Spirit says to the churches. He says
[1:04:03] there's never been a time that's more
[1:04:04] important is now to listen to the spirit
[1:04:08] speaking to the church through the word.
[1:04:10] It's so important. I'm not not talking
[1:04:11] about me. I'm talking about listening to
[1:04:12] the message of the hour. Staying in line
[1:04:14] with Christ. Amen. Man, we got to take
[1:04:17] sides with Jesus because he's the only
[1:04:18] one that can fix anybody. Amen. If he
[1:04:21] can take me a drunken university student
[1:04:23] making homebrew, partying, all those
[1:04:24] things, and he can change my life, he
[1:04:27] can change anyone. I didn't need
[1:04:28] psychology. I needed almighty God. And
[1:04:31] him and his infinite grace found me and
[1:04:32] changed me. And I tell you what, I
[1:04:34] believe he can fix anybody.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to be your shepherd
[1:04:38] today. Praise the Lord. So now, as Jesus
[1:04:42] would say here,
[1:04:44] if I can if I can find it, I want to
[1:04:46] find it here where he says,
[1:04:49] Jesus would say, "His sheep
[1:04:52] know his voice
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and they follow him for they know his
[1:04:56] voice." Amen. So there's already So the
[1:04:59] sheep already know the shepherd. Amen.
[1:05:01] We already know the shepherd. We are
[1:05:03] We're not going to meet someone new on
[1:05:04] the other side. I'm going to be
[1:05:05] repeating this through, but I just want
[1:05:07] you to real I just pray it takes all the
[1:05:08] fear out cuz some people get so anxious.
[1:05:11] Am I going to make it? Is my am I really
[1:05:13] going in the rapture? Am I really going
[1:05:14] to get there? Well, if you've been
[1:05:16] received here, you're already received
[1:05:18] there. Lord,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; right? It's not a it's not a two-step
[1:05:21] deal. It's no, you're sealed today of
[1:05:23] your redemption by the Holy Ghost here.
[1:05:24] You're safe and secure for there for the
[1:05:27] translation.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he says to to him, the porter
[1:05:30] openereth the sheep, hear his voice, and
[1:05:32] calleth his own sheep by name, and
[1:05:34] leadth them out. And when he puteth
[1:05:35] forth his own sheep, he goeth before
[1:05:37] them and his sheep follow him for they
[1:05:39] know his voice. Amen. So they always the
[1:05:42] sheep always follow the shepherd. Now
[1:05:46] there's actually nothing. Brother Bram
[1:05:48] says here he says sorrows of tears can
[1:05:51] never keep the shepherd away. I mean
[1:05:53] because there's always times like I
[1:05:54] don't think Rebecca's journey was an
[1:05:56] easy journey. those 300 whatever
[1:05:58] hundreds of miles from from the Chaldes
[1:06:01] to to the promised land. It would not
[1:06:03] have been an easy journey because our
[1:06:05] journey is not easy. It's worth it but
[1:06:06] it ain't always easy, right? But he says
[1:06:08] here that sorrows and tears can never
[1:06:10] keep the shepherd away. I mean sorrows
[1:06:12] of tears, corruption, he proved it at
[1:06:14] the grave of Lazarus. Lazarus was one of
[1:06:16] his little lambs. He was laying he was
[1:06:19] laying in the uh in the body bottom of a
[1:06:20] pit. Stone rolled over it. His body was
[1:06:22] molded. Nose had dropped in. Skinworms
[1:06:25] was eating him up. But the chief
[1:06:26] shepherd, excuse me, came up to the
[1:06:29] grave, and he knowed his sheep by name.
[1:06:32] And if he speaks your name now and calls
[1:06:34] you, you answer. For there's going to be
[1:06:36] a time, said the prophet, that he will
[1:06:38] call and I'll answer him. Amen. So
[1:06:40] nothing can separate us from our
[1:06:42] shepherd.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Nothing can. Amen. He's always there.
[1:06:45] He's always present. Amen. And he's not.
[1:06:50] And then and then even Jesus said he
[1:06:52] said, "I'm the good shepherd and I and I
[1:06:53] know my sheep and have known of mine. As
[1:06:56] the father knoweth me, even so I even so
[1:06:59] know I the father and I lay down my life
[1:07:02] for the sheep and other sheep I have
[1:07:04] which are not of this fold. Them also I
[1:07:06] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[1:07:08] and there shall be one fold and one
[1:07:10] shepherd." He's talking of you there.
[1:07:11] He's talking of the Gentiles. He said,
[1:07:13] "I've got other sheep that are not here
[1:07:15] of this fold, but they are going to hear
[1:07:17] my voice and they're going to know me
[1:07:19] and they're going to follow me." Amen.
[1:07:21] He was He was thinking of you when he
[1:07:23] spoke those words. Amen. Cuz he knew
[1:07:25] you'd be here in 2025. He knew you'd be
[1:07:28] here on the opposite side of the world,
[1:07:29] the last stop before Antarctica. He knew
[1:07:31] you'd be here. Amen. But he says, "I
[1:07:34] know." But he says, "I must bring them
[1:07:36] into the fold."
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I must pick them up wherever
[1:07:39] they're caught in some thicket of sin
[1:07:41] somewhere or down or religion or
[1:07:43] whatever it is things of man. I'm going
[1:07:44] to pick them up. I'm going to bring them
[1:07:45] into my fold. Amen. And they shall hear
[1:07:48] my voice. Amen. So what God is speaking
[1:07:50] today. Amen. He is not finished. His
[1:07:53] word is still speaking out in this day.
[1:07:55] Amen. Because we shall hear his voice
[1:07:57] and they shall be onefolded one
[1:07:58] shepherd. So he's actively he's actively
[1:08:02] working in our lives. Amen. He's not
[1:08:05] some, as I said before, you know, we
[1:08:07] look at this world and we think, how on
[1:08:09] earth can God be in control? He is in
[1:08:11] control.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Everything is working after the council
[1:08:13] of his own will. Amen. This cha even the
[1:08:15] chaos of this world right now, you say,
[1:08:17] how on earth he's allowing it to happen.
[1:08:20] Amen. That his word would be fulfilled.
[1:08:22] Amen. You got to also realize that God
[1:08:24] put man as the as the god of this world,
[1:08:26] Adam and Eve, right? Then they forfeited
[1:08:29] the throne to Satan. And now Satan is
[1:08:31] the god of this evil age. But God
[1:08:33] permits him to do what he's going to do.
[1:08:35] Amen. He's allowing him to do these
[1:08:37] things. But in this chaos of this world,
[1:08:39] God is with us. Amen. He said, "I'll
[1:08:42] never leave you nor forsake you." Amen.
[1:08:44] He is not, See, God is not some See,
[1:08:46] God, like, you know, people say, you
[1:08:48] know, like intelligent design, it's like
[1:08:50] God just kind of started making
[1:08:51] something. He said, "I'll just I'll just
[1:08:53] let it see what it evolves into." You
[1:08:55] know, God didn't do it that way. When he
[1:08:57] said, "Let there be frogs." There was a
[1:08:58] frog. Let there be fleas, whales, fish.
[1:09:03] They were made as exactly what he called
[1:09:06] them to be. They did not grow into
[1:09:07] something else. Right? So God so so that
[1:09:10] idea that God would just kind of start
[1:09:12] something and see how it kind of turns
[1:09:14] out that he's just watching like a
[1:09:15] spectator watching this thing, that's
[1:09:17] totally wrong. No. God is actively
[1:09:20] working in our lives every day. Amen.
[1:09:23] And it doesn't matter what situation
[1:09:24] we're in. And I say if you're if your
[1:09:27] God's God is working in your life. Amen.
[1:09:29] It's like Joseph was put in prison there
[1:09:31] in Egypt. It says, but God was with
[1:09:33] Joseph in the prison. Amen. He was with
[1:09:35] him in that time where where Joseph is
[1:09:37] feeling like, man, this is all falling
[1:09:38] apart. Lord, how on earth are these
[1:09:40] dreams going to be fulfilled that my
[1:09:41] family's going to bow down before me?
[1:09:43] How on earth is this going to happen?
[1:09:44] But God was with Joseph.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God was with him in that despair.
[1:09:49] I tell you what, friends, he is with us
[1:09:50] in our trouble. Amen. He does never He
[1:09:53] never looks for an exit stage right or
[1:09:55] left when things get too hot or heavy.
[1:09:57] No, he's right there with you in every
[1:09:58] situation. Amen. He is not some
[1:10:01] complacent onlooker or a recording
[1:10:03] angel. But there he is expressing
[1:10:05] exactly what he is. He's a life and
[1:10:07] sustainer and the giver of all good
[1:10:09] gifts to the church. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:11] He is our advocate. He's he's con
[1:10:14] constantly advocating on our behalf.
[1:10:17] Amen. Working on our behalf. The high
[1:10:19] priest of our profession. Amen. He is
[1:10:21] not someone who's silent. He's not a
[1:10:22] silent God. No, he's actively working in
[1:10:25] your life every day. Amen. I trust you.
[1:10:28] Look for him every day as he's your
[1:10:29] shepherd. When you get up in the
[1:10:31] morning, Lord, lead me. You're much
[1:10:33] higher. Lord, lead me. You're much
[1:10:34] wiser. Lord, you know the way back home,
[1:10:36] Lord Jesus. And what does he do? He
[1:10:38] says, "Good now. Now I'm your shepherd.
[1:10:40] I'm going to I'm going to work in your
[1:10:41] life. I tell you what, even before you
[1:10:43] meet him, he was your shepherd." Amen.
[1:10:45] He kept you from a lot of things.
[1:10:46] There's some of us here, amen, that
[1:10:48] should have gone to a premature grave,
[1:10:50] but God wasn't done with us. Amen. God
[1:10:52] was God had to bring us to an expected
[1:10:54] end where we would come to a
[1:10:55] relationship with him and he'd transform
[1:10:57] our lives. There's many of us that would
[1:10:58] have been lost somewhere in the world.
[1:11:00] You would think, Lord, how did we get
[1:11:01] here? And you'd say, "I've been your
[1:11:03] shepherd the whole time.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; You didn't know I was there, but I was
[1:11:06] there." Amen. In the hurting, in the
[1:11:08] pain, in the despair, there was Jesus.
[1:11:10] Amen. He has always been present. Amen.
[1:11:13] So it doesn't matter how bad you feel,
[1:11:15] how down, how troubled. You got to
[1:11:17] realize, no, he's the great shepherd and
[1:11:19] he's your shepherd. Amen. And he won't
[1:11:21] lose one of his sheep. Amen. It doesn't
[1:11:23] matter how far they run, how deep they
[1:11:25] go, how lost they can become, they will
[1:11:28] never stay in that condition.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because they are his sheep.
[1:11:32] Amen. That's why we can lift our
[1:11:34] families before the Lord and say, "God,
[1:11:36] they're your lambs. They're your sheep,
[1:11:37] Lord Jesus. They're the sheep of your
[1:11:39] pastor." Amen, pastor. They're part of
[1:11:41] you, oh God. Go get them. Amen. I tell
[1:11:44] you what, our God loves to be put on
[1:11:46] someone's trail. Amen. He loves to be
[1:11:48] dispensed or sent. Amen. Because why? He
[1:11:51] we bind his power by what we pray.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We actually the power of your
[1:11:57] tongue is incredible. Amen. Where your
[1:12:00] prayers can put God in action or they
[1:12:02] cannot put God in action cuz he's the
[1:12:04] high priest of our profession. So if you
[1:12:06] profess, I'm never going to make it. I'm
[1:12:08] never going to get there. My family's
[1:12:10] hopeless. It's over. It's wrong. It's
[1:12:12] done. He can't intercede. He can't
[1:12:14] fulfill his word in your life cuz you're
[1:12:16] confessing negative. Amen. But if you
[1:12:18] start to confess the promises of his
[1:12:20] word, confess the shepherd back to him
[1:12:22] cuz he is his word. Then he can act on
[1:12:25] your behalf. Amen. You say, "Well, I've
[1:12:27] tried that and it hasn't worked." Are
[1:12:29] you sure? God's timing is different.
[1:12:32] Amen. His timing is different to your
[1:12:34] timing. Your schedule's not his
[1:12:35] schedule. Amen. So, we got to take God
[1:12:37] in his word like like Abraham did. He
[1:12:40] didn't bring He didn't confess the
[1:12:42] deadness of his body. Sarah's womb being
[1:12:45] dead. Is that me? Am I doing something?
[1:12:49] He didn't confess those things.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; You know, he didn't look at those
[1:12:52] things. He said, "No, God said."
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I can just,
[1:13:00] you know, yep. I'll just I'll just do
[1:13:03] this.
[1:13:05] God said, "We're having a son, Sarah.
[1:13:08] We're having a son." God said, "We're
[1:13:10] going to have it, Sarah." Amen. And the
[1:13:12] chief shepherd was there guiding them.
[1:13:14] Even when even when Abraham backslid
[1:13:17] because the conditions said, "Well,
[1:13:18] there was a famine." They went down into
[1:13:20] Greer. They went to other places. Amen.
[1:13:22] He even said to Sarah, "Listen, you're a
[1:13:24] beautiful woman. Tell tell the king that
[1:13:26] uh you're my sister. We're not married."
[1:13:28] He was they were half brother and
[1:13:30] sister. So, a white a white lie is a
[1:13:33] lie. Okay? Bending the truth is still
[1:13:35] not right. Okay? And then even that when
[1:13:37] the you know king was going to marry her
[1:13:39] and all these things and God came down
[1:13:40] spoke to that king and said you're good
[1:13:42] as a dead man.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; He says what do you mean you're as good
[1:13:45] as a dead man. That woman that you want
[1:13:48] to marry is actually that man's wife.
[1:13:50] Restore her. And he said Lord you know
[1:13:52] the integrity of my heart. You know I
[1:13:54] wouldn't have done these things if I
[1:13:55] knew it. He says to you that's why I'm
[1:13:56] warning you. You better you. So so even
[1:13:58] when Abraham did that not once but twice
[1:14:01] God brought him out cuz he is the great
[1:14:04] shepherd. Because God was determined
[1:14:06] that the word was going to be fulfilled
[1:14:07] in Abraham's life. And I tell you what,
[1:14:09] for God's elect, God is determined that
[1:14:12] his word will be fulfilled in your life.
[1:14:14] Amen. Doesn't matter how bad things get.
[1:14:17] I'll tell you what, friends, just
[1:14:18] confess his promises. Amen. Don't never
[1:14:20] let your confession be negative. Doesn't
[1:14:22] matter how you feel. Many times I feel
[1:14:24] down. I feel melancholic. I feel what's
[1:14:26] the point of things? I don't let that
[1:14:28] thing become my confession because I'm
[1:14:30] not going to agree with something that's
[1:14:32] contrary to the word. I mean, I'm going
[1:14:34] to agree with the shepherd's word cuz
[1:14:36] the shepherd's word is always right. I
[1:14:38] mean, it's not based on my circumstance,
[1:14:40] not based what I'm going through. No,
[1:14:42] his word is far above those things.
[1:14:45] Amen. If his word says certain things
[1:14:47] and I take him at his word. So, for
[1:14:48] example, if his word says by his
[1:14:50] stripes, I'm healed. Amen. If he says,
[1:14:53] I'm I'm your counselor. I'm your peace.
[1:14:56] Amen. I'm your joy. I'm your satisfying
[1:14:58] portion. I'm your deliverer. I'm your
[1:15:01] savior. I'm your healer. I'm your guide.
[1:15:03] I'm going to take him at his word and
[1:15:05] choose to believe that because that's
[1:15:07] what my shepherd is. Amen. If he said,
[1:15:09] "I am your provider." I'll say, "Lord,
[1:15:11] you're still Jehovah Gyra." I mean, you
[1:15:13] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:15:15] nor God seed begging bread. I've always
[1:15:17] seen God come through time after time
[1:15:20] after time. And you know why? Many times
[1:15:22] we get to a point where there's just a
[1:15:24] bunch of zeros in the bank cuz God wants
[1:15:26] to prove, "Listen, I'm Jehovah Gyra. Let
[1:15:29] me be Jehovah Gyra. Let me do it for
[1:15:31] you." Amen. We get to a point we say,
[1:15:32] "Lord, I can't do it." That's when he
[1:15:34] can step in.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And that's why he allows those things.
[1:15:37] He loves to prove his word. Amen. Our
[1:15:39] shepherd is not some silent guy who just
[1:15:41] watches what's going on. He loves to
[1:15:44] prove his word.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; He loves to prove that he is the good
[1:15:48] shepherd.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why don't we let him do it in a
[1:15:53] greater way?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so thankful that he
[1:15:58] is our great
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; He is our great shepherd. Amen.
[1:16:02] Glory to God. So he's not some silent
[1:16:04] onlooker, but he's working in your life
[1:16:07] every day.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, last week was much the
[1:16:10] same as the week before that." He is
[1:16:12] working.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; He is molding.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Why do I have to do the, you know, I
[1:16:16] remember being at school. I remember
[1:16:17] being at boarding school. Man, I didn't
[1:16:19] even leave the place even on weekends
[1:16:21] half the time. Why am I in this spot?
[1:16:23] Why am I This is so, you know, and you
[1:16:24] just go through motions and God was
[1:16:27] working there.
[1:16:29] You mean God would use that? Yeah.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; God used Egypt to mold Joseph for the
[1:16:35] throne.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God will God will God will use God used
[1:16:41] the backside of the desert to mold Moses
[1:16:43] ready to deliver his people.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will use your everyday life
[1:16:48] and he does. But are you looking at it
[1:16:49] that way?
[1:16:51] I trust we are. He's actively working.
[1:16:54] You know, see, because the devil wants
[1:16:56] you to think, what's the point? There's
[1:16:58] no use. Just give up and quit. He's
[1:17:01] trying to put that upon you because he
[1:17:03] is afraid. When you really realize who
[1:17:05] you are, when you really realize, I'm
[1:17:07] one of his sheep. Amen. And the Lord is
[1:17:10] my shepherd. There is nothing impossible
[1:17:12] with you when you realize these things.
[1:17:14] Amen. That you have the right to push
[1:17:16] the enemy back. Amen. You have a right
[1:17:18] to call on the shepherd. That the
[1:17:19] shepherd will anoint you to destroy your
[1:17:21] enemy. I mean, to destroy the yoke of
[1:17:23] the enemy by the anointing of God. You
[1:17:26] have a right, amen, to take God at his
[1:17:27] word and actually use your tongue. See,
[1:17:30] that's why I said don't confess
[1:17:31] negative. You say, "Satan, you're not
[1:17:32] welcome here." Amen. Depression, you
[1:17:34] ain't welcome here. Anxiety, you're not
[1:17:36] welcome here. Amen. I don't have to put
[1:17:38] up with you anymore. Moodiness,
[1:17:39] whatever. You're not welcome here. You I
[1:17:42] have the joy of the Lord.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "You don't feel joyful."
[1:17:45] That don't matter. I have the joy of the
[1:17:47] Lord. You'll find you begin to take the
[1:17:49] name of Jesus, child of sorrow of war.
[1:17:51] Who's ever sung that song? Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; I remember times I was down. I'd sing
[1:17:55] that song. I never was down by the time
[1:17:57] I finished it.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it works. Taking God
[1:18:03] at his word, letting him work, letting
[1:18:05] him live, works.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what is it? But what does a
[1:18:09] sheep need to do?
[1:18:12] A sheep I'm just going to find that
[1:18:13] picture again. I'll put it back up. A
[1:18:16] sheep needs to surrender to the
[1:18:17] shepherd. Amen. More than just the sheep
[1:18:22] needs to more than just treat the
[1:18:24] shepherd as a bodyguard or an errand boy
[1:18:26] or a protection or someone when things
[1:18:29] get too bad they can call on him. It's
[1:18:30] more than that. The sheep has to
[1:18:32] surrender their will to the shepherd's
[1:18:34] will. Amen. Because we got to realize he
[1:18:37] knows what he's doing. When you have
[1:18:39] faith, see, see, a lack of faith causes
[1:18:43] people to take their lives into their
[1:18:44] own hands. Amen. If we don't believe in
[1:18:48] if we don't have faith in the Lord, how
[1:18:50] can you trust your life in his hands?
[1:18:53] But if you believe, if you're fully
[1:18:54] persuaded, he's more than able to keep
[1:18:56] that which you've given him, your soul,
[1:18:57] your life. Right? Then you can have then
[1:19:00] you'll have full confidence in him that
[1:19:02] it doesn't matter what goes on, I'm
[1:19:04] staying with you.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's like a sheep gets
[1:19:08] up in the morning and they think, "No, I
[1:19:09] want to go down to that that valley and
[1:19:10] have that grass." And the shepherd takes
[1:19:12] them in the opposite direction. If the
[1:19:14] sheep is surrendered to the shepherd,
[1:19:15] they'll follow the shepherd, right? But
[1:19:17] if the sheep doesn't believe the
[1:19:18] shepherd's leadership, they'll go down
[1:19:20] where they've been before. They'll go
[1:19:21] down to their other things. So, we must
[1:19:23] never see, we must not just treat God,
[1:19:25] well, we don't treat God as some some
[1:19:28] security detail. He's far more than
[1:19:30] that. He's our leader. Amen. Not just
[1:19:33] our savior, but our Lord.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's such a thing many people
[1:19:37] want to take Jesus Christ as their
[1:19:39] savior because they're afraid of hell.
[1:19:40] They don't know where they're going to
[1:19:41] go. But he's got to be your Lord and
[1:19:43] Savior. He's got to be your everything.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to realize when you get up
[1:19:46] in the morning that if these unexpected
[1:19:48] things happen in the day, it's working
[1:19:50] for your good. Amen. You say, well, you
[1:19:52] know, well, why did that need to happen?
[1:19:54] This is frustrating. There should be
[1:19:55] nothing that's frustrating.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's a big thing to say. I'm probably
[1:19:59] going to be tested on that. But you see,
[1:20:00] but we should realize, no, God has a you
[1:20:03] get stuck in traffic. There's a reason.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, you burst a tire, there's a
[1:20:08] reason. Well, do you know the reason?
[1:20:10] Not necessarily. But God could have
[1:20:12] saved you from an from an accident.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, maybe maybe you need to learn
[1:20:16] some patience in traffic instead of
[1:20:18] hooning around and cutting corners and,
[1:20:20] you know, cuz that doesn't lead people
[1:20:21] in a good way. They normally crash and
[1:20:23] stuff,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; you know. So, there's and then you real,
[1:20:26] well, well, I'm stuck in the car. What
[1:20:27] am I going to do? You can talk to the
[1:20:29] Lord,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; put on a message, call someone handsree,
[1:20:34] you know. I don't know, you know, but
[1:20:37] use that time. Well, we'll just sit
[1:20:39] there and sing whatever, you know, but
[1:20:41] there's a purpose in it.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, things are going, why is this
[1:20:45] happening in my life? There's a purpose
[1:20:47] for it.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz why? The shepherd wants you to have
[1:20:51] full faith, confidence in him.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you But if you don't if you
[1:20:56] don't believe he's able, you'll find
[1:20:58] your own way. And it's amazing. Sheep
[1:21:01] actually can easily get lost. Amen. They
[1:21:04] can't find their way home. They're not
[1:21:06] migratory animals. They're very actually
[1:21:08] quite useless things,
[1:21:11] you know. But thank God I'm his sheep.
[1:21:14] I don't want to be a goat. I don't want
[1:21:16] to be a wolf. I don't want to be a
[1:21:17] whatever. I'm glad I'm his sheep.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the sheep are the ones that go
[1:21:22] into the go into the um corral or
[1:21:24] whatever at the end of the day. Amen.
[1:21:26] It's like brother Bram when he was he
[1:21:28] was overseas somewhere and you know
[1:21:30] there were shepherds but shepherds of
[1:21:31] different animals. He saw goats, he saw
[1:21:33] sheep, uh camels, different things. And
[1:21:36] then and then you know he was asking the
[1:21:38] guy who was showing him around about
[1:21:39] these things and they came up to the
[1:21:41] conversation of well what do the animals
[1:21:43] do when the sun goes down and and the
[1:21:46] guide said it's only the sheep that go
[1:21:48] into the corral at the end of the day.
[1:21:50] The others are left in darkness
[1:21:51] wandering around. And he said praise the
[1:21:54] Lord. Amen. Because if I'm his sheep
[1:21:56] mean before the sun goes down before
[1:21:58] this chaos of the world comes in he's
[1:22:00] going to get me into a sheepfold. I'm
[1:22:01] going to be safe and secure. Amen. Away
[1:22:03] from the darkness and the predators and
[1:22:05] everything.
[1:22:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So nothing can separate us can
[1:22:11] keep the shepherd away.
[1:22:14] Amen. I just wanted to read this here
[1:22:17] if I can find it.
[1:22:22] We could read this together. There's a
[1:22:23] bit of a lengthy reading, but you know
[1:22:24] this is David in Psalm 139. Just realize
[1:22:28] nothing can separate us from from our
[1:22:30] shepherd.
[1:22:32] He says, he says, "Oh Lord, thou hast
[1:22:34] searched me and known me. Thou knowest
[1:22:37] my downsitting and my uprising. Thou
[1:22:39] understandeth my thought a far off. Thou
[1:22:43] compasseth my path and my lying down,
[1:22:46] and are art acquainted in all my ways."
[1:22:49] See, they've met before. Okay? For there
[1:22:53] is not a word in my tongue, but lo, oh
[1:22:55] Lord, thou knowest it all together. Thou
[1:22:57] hast beset me behind and before and laid
[1:23:00] thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is
[1:23:02] too wonderful for me. It is high and I
[1:23:05] cannot obtain unto it. Whether shall I
[1:23:07] go from thy spirit or whether shall I
[1:23:09] flee from thy presence? If I ascend up
[1:23:11] into heaven, thou art there? If I make
[1:23:13] my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
[1:23:16] If I take the wings of the morning and
[1:23:17] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
[1:23:20] even there shall thy hand lead me, and
[1:23:22] thy right hand shall thou hold me. If I
[1:23:24] say, Surely the the darkness shall cover
[1:23:27] me, even the night shall be light about
[1:23:29] me. Yay, the darkness hideth not from
[1:23:31] thee, but the night but the night
[1:23:33] shineth as the day. The darkness and the
[1:23:36] light are both alike to thee. For thou
[1:23:39] hast possessed my reigns. Thou has
[1:23:41] covered me in my mother's womb. I will
[1:23:43] praise thee, for I am fearfully and
[1:23:44] wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy
[1:23:46] works, and that my soul knoweth right
[1:23:49] well. My substance was not hid from thee
[1:23:52] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:23:54] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[1:23:55] earth. Thine eyes did see my substance
[1:23:58] yet being unper and in thy book all my
[1:24:00] members were written which in
[1:24:02] continuence were fashioned when as yet
[1:24:05] there was none of them. How precious
[1:24:07] also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God,
[1:24:09] how great is the sum of them. If I
[1:24:11] should count them, they are more in
[1:24:13] number than the sand. When I awake, I
[1:24:15] will still be with thee. Search me, oh
[1:24:17] Lord, and know my heart. Try me and know
[1:24:19] my thoughts. And if there be any wicked
[1:24:21] way in me and lead me in the way
[1:24:23] everlasting.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So David came to a point wherever
[1:24:28] I go, Lord, you're going to be there.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever I go, if I go to heaven,
[1:24:33] you're there. If I make my bed in hell,
[1:24:34] the grave, you'll be there. Amen. You
[1:24:37] know all about me, Lord. He says, "These
[1:24:38] thoughts are too high for me. Too
[1:24:40] incredible when we realize that the God
[1:24:42] that made us knows us really well."
[1:24:45] Amen. that even you know even even the
[1:24:48] um you know even brother would say you
[1:24:50] know people would say you don't know the
[1:24:52] Bible very well he says but I know the
[1:24:53] author really well
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; amen so it's not like and and I'm going
[1:24:57] to start slowly winding this up but you
[1:24:59] know we got to realize that the God we
[1:25:02] are going to meet there is the one we
[1:25:04] know here we've already met him on this
[1:25:05] side I mean so there shouldn't be any
[1:25:08] fear or worry if you've really met him
[1:25:11] that settles everything I mean the sin
[1:25:14] questions over the am Am I going to make
[1:25:16] it over? And my acceptance's over.
[1:25:19] That's answered.
[1:25:21] Praise the Lord. Even Ev even would say
[1:25:22] in um uh Ephesians chapter 1, it says
[1:25:26] that he has made us accepted in the
[1:25:29] beloved. Amen. Say, "Well, how do I know
[1:25:31] I'm accepted?" Well, I'm accepted in the
[1:25:33] beloved. I'm accepted in Christ. Amen.
[1:25:36] Where where and then So, how do we get
[1:25:39] into where we're accepted in the
[1:25:40] beloved? Well, Peter gave a real easy.
[1:25:43] He said, "Repent." So change your mind.
[1:25:45] Turn around from your ways. Be baptized
[1:25:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:25:49] the remission of sin. And you shall
[1:25:50] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[1:25:52] that gift is to you to your children
[1:25:54] those are far off as many as the Lord
[1:25:55] our God shall call. So if there's a
[1:25:57] longing in your heart for for more of
[1:26:00] God for the Holy Ghost. Amen. Why? It's
[1:26:02] because he's calling you. He's calling
[1:26:04] you by name. He's calling you. Say,
[1:26:06] "Child, come walk with me. I want to be
[1:26:09] your shepherd. I want you to meet me
[1:26:11] here." Amen. and that it's not, you
[1:26:13] know, that we can walk together upon
[1:26:15] this earth right now.
[1:26:18] Praise the Lord. So, let's just finish
[1:26:21] with Rebecca quickly. Let's go back to
[1:26:22] the story. We've made a big segue, but
[1:26:24] there she was. She was watering the
[1:26:27] camels. She didn't realize she was
[1:26:29] fulfilling the prayer of Eleazar.
[1:26:32] And then she came after she said she
[1:26:35] would go, she realized that the that the
[1:26:38] that the animals that she was winging
[1:26:41] was going to pack her to see her
[1:26:42] bridegroom. I mean, is that right? Amen.
[1:26:45] What is watering? The very power that we
[1:26:47] are watering now with praise and
[1:26:49] thanksgiving and glory and power and
[1:26:50] might is the very Holy Spirit that will
[1:26:52] pack us to see Jesus someday. Amen. It's
[1:26:55] not a different power. It's the same
[1:26:56] power. Look, it was the call of the
[1:26:58] evening when Isaac walked out. And some
[1:27:00] people say, "Well, what if you see him
[1:27:01] and he's a real dark Jew if he's this?"
[1:27:04] I don't care what he looks like. He's my
[1:27:05] savior. And when the bride sees him,
[1:27:07] it'll be love at first sight. When
[1:27:09] Rebecca seen Isaac, she jumped off the
[1:27:11] camel and run to meet him. It was love
[1:27:12] at first sight. I tell you, when we see
[1:27:14] him, it'll be love at first sight. Off
[1:27:16] we'll go. And away will into his arms.
[1:27:18] Certainly, how beautiful. The bride, the
[1:27:20] evening lights coming, the faith that
[1:27:22] was once delivered to the saints
[1:27:23] beginning to restore back to the church.
[1:27:25] The fig trees putting forth its bud. she
[1:27:27] begin to move out. Amen. So the same
[1:27:31] power that you're watering with praise
[1:27:33] and thanksgiving and adoration is going
[1:27:35] to pack you from this world to the next
[1:27:37] world.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; It's going to carry you away.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just going to
[1:27:43] finish with this one story. So actually
[1:27:44] the musicians could come if if you want
[1:27:46] to come this morning. Amen. So brother
[1:27:49] Bram tells a story when he goes to pray
[1:27:50] for a woman called Mrs. Ohia who was who
[1:27:54] was crippled up in a bed. She was she
[1:27:56] was an Armenian and um the Lord showed
[1:27:59] her where she lived and showed um showed
[1:28:01] that you know to go pray for her by a
[1:28:03] vision and then you know she came in and
[1:28:05] she you know he came in and um there was
[1:28:08] a young lady there was about 17 she had
[1:28:10] on her brother's shoe she kindly stepped
[1:28:12] back one side and there laid this old
[1:28:14] woman said that's her that's the one I
[1:28:15] said sister what have you been reading
[1:28:17] she says it's an Armenian Bible I said
[1:28:19] do you believe I said ever since I seen
[1:28:21] in the paper about the man being healed
[1:28:23] I said there's hopes for me. I said,
[1:28:25] "God has heard your prayer and he sent
[1:28:27] me that I might pray for you." And the
[1:28:29] woman jumped out of the bed, running
[1:28:31] around over the house, perfectly normal
[1:28:33] and well, right to her and go see her.
[1:28:35] Many of the people in the neighborhood
[1:28:36] heard the screaming and they thought it
[1:28:38] was a funeral service. Uh, it was an old
[1:28:41] person died, a new one was born again.
[1:28:43] All right. When she came out there, she
[1:28:45] said she's excited, that's all. She just
[1:28:47] got excited and let the muscles down in
[1:28:49] her legs, whatever that means. Some
[1:28:50] excuse that people try and put on God
[1:28:52] doing the supernatural. He says, "About
[1:28:54] 5 years later, I was standing in the
[1:28:55] butcher shop. I seen her through the
[1:28:57] glass come in. She walked with her
[1:28:59] husband. She touched me on that arm. I
[1:29:00] acted like I didn't see her. And I
[1:29:02] looked over this way. She touched me
[1:29:04] back and and and I looked the other
[1:29:05] way." She said, "I fooled you, didn't
[1:29:07] I?" I said, "No." And she said, "Brother
[1:29:09] Brown, you remember a long time ago they
[1:29:11] told me I was excited." I said, "Yes,
[1:29:13] ma'am." She said, "I'm still excited
[1:29:14] because I'm still walking." Amen. Amen.
[1:29:17] Amen. I mean, I mean, you better get
[1:29:19] excited, brother. Excitement don't heal
[1:29:21] the sick. The power of God is what heals
[1:29:22] the sick. It's the evening lights that
[1:29:24] are falling. Amen. So I trust he's
[1:29:26] touched you just like he touched
[1:29:28] Rebecca. Says, "I will go." I mean, put
[1:29:30] an excitement and expectation in her
[1:29:32] heart. I'm going to meet my bridegroom.
[1:29:33] Amen. And the Lord has touched us. Amen.
[1:29:36] I say, "I'm still excited cuz I'm still
[1:29:38] walking." Amen. I'm still walking with
[1:29:40] the Lord. Amen. I'm still walking with
[1:29:41] my shepherd. Amen. He healed me
[1:29:43] spiritually to walk with him. Amen. And
[1:29:46] I'm still excited because I'm still
[1:29:47] walking. Amen. And I pray this morning
[1:29:50] you're still walking with him and to
[1:29:52] realize the one we meet here is the same
[1:29:53] one we meet there. That there shouldn't
[1:29:55] be any fear or trepidation in our
[1:29:57] hearts. I pray if there is that God
[1:29:59] would work in your life and he would
[1:30:00] take that fear and worry away. He just
[1:30:02] replace with a faith of full assurance.
[1:30:04] Lord, I know in whom I have believed.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So friends, let's continue
[1:30:09] this journey watering the the power of
[1:30:12] the Holy Ghost with praise and
[1:30:13] thanksgiving. Amen. because that same
[1:30:15] power is going to pack us to glory soon
[1:30:17] and very soon. Amen. And we will see
[1:30:19] him. I just want to finish with this one
[1:30:21] quote that I thought was was quite
[1:30:23] marvelous. Um it's just a short one.
[1:30:26] He's speaking of the new heavens and new
[1:30:28] earth. But I just feel this is really
[1:30:29] nice just for now. He says, "The bride
[1:30:31] goes wherever the bridegroom is. She
[1:30:33] will never be left by him. She will
[1:30:35] never leave his side. She will share the
[1:30:37] throne with him. She'll be crowned with
[1:30:39] his glory and honor." Amen. So the bride
[1:30:42] never leaves the bride. You know, she is
[1:30:44] where he is and she will never be left
[1:30:47] by him. I love that. Don't you? You're
[1:30:49] never out of his care. Amen. God is with
[1:30:53] you in trouble, strife, questions,
[1:30:56] problems, good times, bad times. He
[1:30:59] said, "I'd never leave you nor forsake
[1:31:00] you." Amen. And if you don't know him
[1:31:02] that way, I pray you'd open your heart.
[1:31:04] Say, "Lord, I want to know you that way,
[1:31:06] Lord. You're a God of reality." Amen.
[1:31:09] Let's stand this morning, shall we?
[1:31:15] Amen.
[1:31:17] Is it you can have it your way, Jesus?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Perfect.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; If you lead through the valley, I'll go
[1:31:32] and in faith I'll believe that you know
[1:31:37] what is best for the plan that you have.
[1:31:42] in your great mind.
[1:31:48] You meet with the eagle soul,
[1:31:53] where my joy and my peace overflow.
[1:31:58] And I know that you must think I need
[1:32:05] refreshing if you pour out the oil and
[1:32:09] the wine.
[1:32:11] Or if you leave through the blazing
[1:32:14] fire.
[1:32:16] If I have to wait until the morning
[1:32:20] comes, I'll wait.
[1:32:25] You can have it your way, Jesus,
[1:32:29] your way.
[1:32:32] You can have it your way, Jesus,
[1:32:37] your way.
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:42] You lead to the battle. I'll stand
[1:32:47] for I know that you save by your right
[1:32:51] hand.
[1:32:53] You teaches my fingers to find my hands
[1:32:58] to war.
[1:33:03] If you leave down a lonely mind
[1:33:08] where there's tear drops and heartaches
[1:33:11] and trles,
[1:33:13] I will know this is just your refine.
[1:33:19] pinninging fire
[1:33:25] or if you lead to the blazing fire.
[1:33:31] If I have to wait until the morning
[1:33:36] away.
[1:33:39] You can have it your way, Jesus.
[1:33:43] Your way.
[1:33:47] You can heaven your way, Jesus.
[1:33:51] Your way.
[1:33:55] When it all When it all looks like it's
[1:33:59] failing,
[1:34:02] you can have it your way. Jesus,
[1:34:07] when all my fail
[1:34:11] me,
[1:34:13] you can have it your way.
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:17] When the blessing
[1:34:20] like a fountain,
[1:34:23] you can have it your way. Jesus.
[1:34:27] And when I conquer every mountain,
[1:34:33] you can have it. When it all looks like
[1:34:37] and when it all looks like it's failing,
[1:34:43] you can help me.
[1:34:48] When all my foes say me,
[1:34:54] you can have it your way.
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:58] When the blessing flow like a fountain,
[1:35:04] you can have it your way, Jesus.
[1:35:08] And when I conquer every mountain,
[1:35:14] you can have it your way.
[1:35:21] If you pour out the oil and the wine,
[1:35:26] or if you lead through the blazing fire,
[1:35:31] if I have to wait until the morning come
[1:35:37] our way.
[1:35:40] You can have it your way, Jesus.
[1:35:44] Your way.
[1:35:48] You can have it your way, Jesus,
[1:35:52] your way.
[1:35:55] Oh, you can have it your way, Jesus,
[1:36:00] your way.
[1:36:02] Yes, you can have it your way, Jesus,
[1:36:07] your way.
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:18] Every time I try to make it on my own.
[1:36:24] Every time I try to stand and start to
[1:36:28] fall.
[1:36:30] All these lonely roads that I have
[1:36:34] traveled on.
[1:36:37] There was Jesus.
[1:36:43] When the life I built came crashing to
[1:36:46] the ground.
[1:36:50] When the friends I had were nowhere to

[1:43:04] great shepherd and you're not some
[1:43:05] passive onlooker, but you're actively
[1:43:07] working in our lives and you love to be
[1:43:09] called on the scene. We love to be taken
[1:43:11] at your word. Father, may we do that in

[2:01:12] when the tears they fall
[2:01:16] through it all,
[2:01:19] I believe.
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:24] And if I look, it seems like it's
[2:01:27] broken.
[2:01:31] I'll lay a hallelujah
[2:01:34] on the altar.
[2:01:38] And if I look, it seems like it's over.
[2:01:45] I'll lay a hallelujah
[2:01:48] on the altar
[2:01:52] because he's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[2:01:57] He's a miracle working God. He's a
[2:02:01] miracle. He's a miracle. He's a miracle
[2:02:06] working God.
[2:02:08] And if my God is for me, then who can
[2:02:13] stand
[2:02:14] against me? If my God is for me, he's a
[2:02:19] miracle working. God is miracle working.
[2:02:24] Death defeating, promiseke keeping God.
[2:02:29] A miracle working, death defeating,
[2:02:33] promisekeeping
[2:02:34] God.
[2:02:36] A miracle working, death defeating,
[2:02:40] promisekeeping
[2:02:42] God.
[2:02:43] A miracle working, death defeating,
[2:02:47] promisekeeping
[2:02:49] God.
[2:02:51] Oh yes. He's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[2:02:56] He's a miracle working God. He's a
[2:03:00] miracle. He's a miracle. He's a miracle
[2:03:05] working God.
[2:03:07] And if my God is for me, then who can
[2:03:12] stand
[2:03:14] against me? If my God is for me, he's a
[2:03:19] miracle working God.
