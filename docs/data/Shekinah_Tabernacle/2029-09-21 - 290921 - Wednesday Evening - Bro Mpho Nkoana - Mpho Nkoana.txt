for the court lord jesus christ the songwriter says lord you brought us from a mighty long way a mighty long stay in the wilderness father and here we are today we can sing the song lord of praise unto thee we thank you we commit the service lord into your hands we commit the word we commit the people we commit every heart into thy precious hands father we say father let you let it be you not

much brother armand for the music and the songs to prepare the service and the atmosphere for the word of god amen and thank you to musicians for supporting and i don't know today i'm more nervous than than any other day and somehow just pray for me because it's not up to me is not up to anyone who can do anything it's actually up to the lord in english they say i i'm a nobody you know for me to stand here doesn't matter who stands i mean nobody it is the lord who speaks amen so before before we can see it perhaps let's just uh read the the word first in the book of um ezekiel chapter 36 amen can we read from the book of ezekiel 36 and then after after that we will sit down after we read ezekiel we'll sit down amen um how many of you had a wonderful week how many of you had a beautiful week amen the lord is good amen hallelujah just losing my touch there but get in there amen if you found it you can just say amen ezekiel 36 let's read 25 to 27 amen for i will take you from among the heathen sorry what did i say 25 my apologies read yesterday is the word of god for i will take you from among the heathens this is 24 then and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land this is where we were supposed to have started here now the one that follows 25 then i will sprinkle clean water upon you and he shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you 26 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh let's pray again father father god we thank you for the reading of your word father anyone can open the bible and even read it but father were taught that it takes you to interpret your weight low and we believe that the interpretation of your weight father is when your weight comes into manifestation when your weight leaves the one that you spoke when it comes to live in the lives of your children that is the interpretation and that is the fulfillment of your weight father i pray therefore that you bless this word as we read it to our hearts may you pour your spirit your presence in the heart the eyes the ears the mind and the body of each and every one of your children they have come from different directions lord with different needs with different testimonies with different requests with different trials with different test temptations and i pray dear father that may you be the one who is the center post of each and every one of their knees i pray my father as we commit the service into your hands asking for thy grace and for that mercy these things will ask in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen you may enjoy the comfort of your sins and as we start um god bless you richly so i somewhat not don't know where to start but uh i would like to start a little bit just with that image there that image that we are looking our title tonight will be will you marry me ask the lord amen the lord is asking will you marry me you know that question is a very important question because each and every young girl each and every young lady throughout all her life as far as i know they look forward to that isn't it ah my girl tell it i always confuse her sister in her tiana isn't it i hope little is also watching there there at the snow isn't it so sister elizabeth yeah every young girl looks forward to that question in her life once upon a time and every young man look forward to express that question isn't it brother marion brother ben that is true isn't it each and every young man look forward to ask that question one day the reason is that it is a very important question and that is the question tonight which i need you to flip it a bit more away from the kernel side to the spiritual side because that is the question that the lord asked you will you marry me he asked you know what your answer was i know what your answer was you know what did you say you said yes i do i will that's what you said am i right is there anyone who did not say so anyone who did not say yes i do come on you may be shy to express it by raising of your hand but the fact of the matter is this you said yes i do that's what you said to the to that question and that's what we are going to talk about tonight because as our subject as our supportive statement below there says his love showing daily in her life when from the day that she said yes i do now she changes everything about her changes she becomes a new person all right that's the context that i want us to take looking more at what happens after will you marry me what actually happens because there is before will you marry me and after will you marry me something happened there that changed the life of this young woman and this is the one that i'm talking to this woman who's standing in front of me that's the one i'm talking to because paul says i have espoused you you are the bride right even so in the book of revelation he says we are the bride he's our husband right and we are the bride we are singing a song that we are going for a meeting in the sky but that meeting the preparations of that meeting begins where after will you marry me after you said yes it starts here i have never heard of a girl who start to prepare a wedding two days three days one week before she gets married i've never had right so let's just continue that's a beautiful picture and you see you see you see that one that's the sim is the most beautiful thing that a young woman will ever receive you know one of my children showed me something about this finger this one is a very special finger in both hands you can try this exercise and you will see how it works you can raise up this one you can raise up this one you can raise up this one you can raise up this one but that one how did it work era i forgot that you know that there was a place where you couldn't raise this one what did they say i forgot the exercise but it was time to demonstrate whatever the head is doing after service go to brother a he's going to demonstrate what i want to tell you now demonstrating the weakness of that finger that that finger cannot function by itself that finger it cannot function by itself that's the fingering it can't function it's weak it needs to function with another finger right we without christ we are us that is why he put that golden ring on our finger after we have agreed i want us to proceed with our lesson and i'll try my best not to be long will you marry me you can see her she's wearing a gown is the word bright that did not take place a week or two before from the day that she agreed she started to prepare because she became a new person are we together now i just want to read for you before we we continue brother branham in that message of the invisible union of the bride and of christ he says the illustration here where here right i'm the one who's referring to that one but that illustration here showing the relationship of bride to christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she will come from and how that should be brought to him the church here in illustration that we go in view is illustration by a woman which a woman is always a type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god that is who you are paul all across the bible he speaks about the love of christ to his bride from genesis to revelation that is about it so brother brendan is trying to tell us there just as if as a foundation he was you know he was trying to show who we are to christ right columbrite shalom right now we have read that scripture i want us to read matthew 25 i would like everyone just to be comfortable relaxed and then don't focus on me the minister just focus on the word because it is him who said will you marry me to you i'm just conveying and reminding you and refreshing your hearts and your minds of what you said right let's read matthew 25 1-10 the bible says then shall the kingdom of heaven be like an end to 10 visions we know the story right and then which took their lambs and went forth to meet at the bridegroom there's two and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them the foolish ones they took their lamps right while the bridegroom turret they all slumbered and slept i've underlined limbs and i've underlined slept in my about i don't know why and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom coming goi out to meet him then all those visions all of them arose and trimmed their limbs and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil for our lambs are gone out why why are they asking such a question you can already see that the foolish ones went in there at unprepared they did not prepare what they were supposed but they said i do are you together they said i do they they took long months and months probably preparing their gowns you know a wedding is a project you know you know sister sister sister priscilla you do decorations right you know probably you have some experience of how on the day of the wedding we decorate many of you here who are married you have been bryce before it take it's a big project arrangements everything but the main focus on the day of the wedding we are looking at the bride that's where our focus is we are looking we are we are not much looking at the man he can wear a suit like me today that is not meshing with the pants but the bright that's where the center of attraction is right now let's just read those last two verses but the wise answered saying not so left there be not enough for us and you but go ye there uh sorry but go eat them to be um but go either rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves right and while they went to buy the bread room came and they that were ready they that way let's say ready went in with him to the marriage the door was shot you see so the story of of of these girls five wives five foolish it goes deeper to the point where you if you just practicalize it you'll realize that they took a long time preparing for this medium of the bread groom i would imagine that each and everyone went and bought a special pair of shoes each and everyone wants when to buy a perfume each and every one of them went to prepare their hair they prepared everything they prepared they bought new new lamps hopefully and they came with everything within them and the day arrived that they were supposed to go and hurry and wait for the bridegroom the only thing that they did not do they did not take the oil they were coming to service every day they were coming for for a long time probably for all their lifetime they were coming to church they were born in the house where my father and the mother are message believers they were born they had the message and the message brought them and they were pulled by the first pool they were pulled by the second pool they came in i'm not talking about those girls the the ones not of the ten those that did not even respond to the invitation no i'm not talking about those ones i'm talking about the ones that came in but the problem the difference with these two they were foolish these ones were wise the only distinctive feature that we see why they were foolish because they did not bring the oil right so they prepared everything right now let let's take this old story that you all know of a girl in the land afar off can you see it a girl in a land after of living in a family where she's actually an orphan he's living with her aunt and her aunt has got daughters also you know this little girl she does not have parents she was just adopted and she came and she's living with this family now now she's being abused she's being given hot jobs she's doing all the chores alone she's a talk she's a laugh because she does not have nice dresses like them she's titted like an outcast simply because she is an orphan their rights are more higher and nicer and important than hairs she's less of a human being than them huh them they are important i read a book called animal farm many years ago you know so but let's let's not go there that's not where we are i was just thinking about when those boxer and and those pigs said you know no no no no no no it looks like oh we are not all equally here and they made a resolution that all animals are equal no anyone why it seems like all other animals are more equal than others so that lady was not really equal with those girls in that house that is why she was treated like that but she was working and she was working and one day a priest a prince came to that village and that man came and then he he came and to see you know the village and then he saw the chief there and visiting and and then and because that that village was part of his kingdom and then uh he was coming also to look for a wife at the same time and when he was there the girls prepared they did exactly like the 10 visions right they prepared and then they went to the ball they went there to to to express their interest when you go on the website of immigration they say there's expression of interest they want to express their interest so that the king can hopefully the chief the prince can choose them and they did all they were supposed to do each and everyone walking passing passing passing but the prince never chose one of them the prince got bored in state it was blossom because of the mannerism so he took a walk he just took a walk he said to his body guys no no i'll just take your walk alone he took a walk and went on the outskirts of the village and he was just walking taking a walk thinking where is he going to get this virtuous woman that he's looking for and then as he was walking then he he was caught up in the eye by a girl who was just throwing water you know in a basin you know you know in my country in the rural areas we don't have running water like where you wake up water just come up from the trap no we put water in the basement we wash dishes then we go through it outside so he was just throwing water dirty water from the dishes wearing an a wreck and an apron that is torn and little dirty and then he he looked at there and then when he saw it he saw a character when he saw he saw he he connected with this girl when he saw her she's here while all other girls are there didn't she know that i'm coming in this village what was wrong with you with her then and then he greeted her then she was shy she didn't want to talk he said hi hi i cannot just have just a word with you then he started to talk to her to engage her and talk and talk to her and then she started to fall in love with him but she knew that she is unworthy if her auntie can just come from that corner there in her mercedes she'll run so the prince said you know i love you and the prince proposed to her and the priest the prince asked her that question will you marry me is that me say yes i love you please and the principal probably did this and said please you know everybody's at the ball they're drinking they think maybe the prince has just gone to the bathroom or just one you know they're waiting to do for the second round of the of the passing before the prince then he says he said it would be my privilege i will but you know in here she said she just thought is this a dream or what he said he said to her listen i want to give you something i'm going to come back in one year from now one year i'm gonna come back to fetch you and i want you to be ready on that day on such and such a day i'm going to come and you must be ready only her she knew only her had the revelation of what the priest the prince said omg it was only revealed to her only her she knew she couldn't talk anybody to convince them because they wouldn't believe it that that word was her only sustenance and that very same way it was something that destroys them that did not get the revelation you see so she told them the friends she told them but they couldn't believe it they ridiculed her they just mocked her and but she knew that the more they do that is because she know that me i have seen the prince so one day he came to fetch it you know the rest of the story but the moral of the story is that from the day that the prince spoke to him from that day she was a different girl from she moved from being a slave she moved from being a nanny she moved from being a dishwasher in her heart she was continuing to watch dishes she was continuing to wear the rest but from that day she was normal from that day she was normal they could give her more work that would be a joy for her because the more they give her the work the more in her she says i'm your queen by the way i i'm going to be the one that i'm going to be giving instructions all those troubles what were they doing to him they were propelling him they were exciting that is why the bible says count it all joy when all these things fall unto you because those things should remind you a christian should not be someone who is brought down and down and down every day the enemy come when the enemy come it's an opportunity to say my you are doing that because you don't know that i am the queen ah you don't have the revelation because the prince never came and spoke to you the prince of peace you see so so so the issue is that from that day she changed she started to prepare every single day her life now surrounded her life everything around her life was about what the prince said every single day i'm sure 99 of her thoughts 98 of everything she was doing it was about what the prince says she will just sit down and just start talking to herself listen here my dear i'm coming in one year he will just repeat those words every day just repeating them they thought he's mad he starts repeating this thing every day she's saying why because she had the prince speaking that my dad my dear one be ready i'm coming to fetch well you know what she did everything in her power she went extra she went and grabbed everything to to prepare to get a dress to get a dress to prepare everything to get ready it was the theme of her daily life after that revelation that way was given to her the word of promise that will you marry me and she agreed from that time she changed now the question that i want to ask you is that uh what does she do daily in preparation for this big day what does she do he's busy preparing for the coming back of the prince she's not worried anymore about her future here in her aunt's house she's not worried anymore about what's going to happen to her she's not worried about their beautiful dresses she's not worried about everything around him anymore right now listen to the korean things for i am jealous i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to to one husband that i may present you as a as a chaste vision of christ did you hear that you are being espoused matthew but he he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god you see that that that lady each and every day the sustenance of her life all her problems you can think of her history and how her sufferings were but only one word i'm coming back for you i promise that is what was keeping her every day now there was food there in the house of auntie there was things she had a room she had but those things mattered less in her life one thing was mattering in her life she was not living by bread alone every single day he was living on the weight of the prince every day so it is it is the issue here brothers and sisters you are the bride and i want to to bring the you know in science they give you formulas and they write them so i want to bring this formula in reverse i want to reverse it we say a plus b is c right so i want to say a minus b is a i mean c minus b is a are we together that's how they do formulas right brother that's how they do mathematics isn't it honey they say a plus b is c but c minus b is a so i want to take it from i want to say you are the bright you've been chosen you agreed you are preparing right the question is uh the manifestation of your preparation your daily preparations your daily lives should reflect that which you are are we together because you you are the bride you agree right you are greed this man is coming man this man is coming to take all your horror on earth whatever you are that you ever know in your life is going to end it is actually begun to end so how should my daily life be it should be c minus b is equals to a because we said a plus b c it can be that a plus b is c and then c minus x is a no it can't it must be in reverse it must give us the same answer the same results so you are the bright you are the lady you are preparing but how is your daily life is it reflecting it's our daily life every day showing that which we are professing every day that's the question and that's the thought that i would like us to look into not judging you not uh trying to prove that you are not you know you are but the question is is it if it's not reflecting that which you have agreed to then that's what we need to deal with that's what that's what we need to sort out because we are greed you are the bright enjoy and love you are in love you have agreed to go to the marriage supper but how come every day you are not preparing for the merit stop how come am i not how come am i easily this upset do you think that lady was anything that was going to really really really upset her brother ben that girl that the way they were upsetting her before the prince and the way they upset her now do you think was just the same not any longer there was nothing that could really touch her i could come to you and say and tell you about your past and say hey brother you say oh brother listen oh i love you brother you know what my past is not an issue anymore the issue is my present and my future the devil will come and say hey a year you are getting married are you sure you must have seen some sochi sorry in south africa eh what is it suzy for armand and so she is you know this useless guy who just work here robbing people maybe it was just a criminal working and you thought it was the prince are you sure are you sure it's you do you understand what you're talking about you are an orphan no no no no no no no me being an orphan me wearing the racks that i'm wearing me my parents dying me washing your dishes and you abusing me and hitting me every day and ridiculing me those things i don't matter anymore because it's the past what matters is what i'm doing now and what i'm going to be that's what matters i love what brother john and he said the other day he said you know it's not what the past that matters anymore no the past is not it is it's actually the past is the past [Music] he took his your sin and threw them in god's sea of forgetfulness if god can forget those things god if he can forget why is it not easy for us to forget huh are we preparing for the wedding because we are supposed to be preparing for the wedding we've got no time to think about my aunts daughters what they are doing to me how they are treating me no no amen let's see what the prophet say there lord he was praying there lord of taking this text as is placed upon my heart to send out across the nations for people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live you see what type of life is required for you and me to live we do come to church brothers and sisters we do we are christians we are god's children we are the children of god that were chosen the only question that we are asking is is our life on a daily basis reflecting back to every iota isn't it it's not used for me to come and tell him i don't worry brothers and sisters we are all going that is true that is correct but your going is not depending on what i'm saying your going it's not depending on what you are saying i can say until i am i won't be blue because i'm already brown until i'm i'm black i can say you can say it until you turn blue that will not make you to go what will make you to go is the life on a daily basis the manifestation what comes out of you the preparations huh the living of the word that the prince promised you that's what matters it's not what i say yes what you're saying is important he did come in and propose to you did you agree yes you agreed wholeheartedly yes so the life must show amen right for so many has asked me the prophet is praying is the christian's life a life of church service is it helping the poor the needy or is it a constant member those things we are all we are all we are doing a shakina tabernacle we are leaving a christian church service church church life we come to church every sunday and every wednesday we are helping the poor the pastor himself go there to take the food to the poor people we help those that we can we help across the pacific and even up to africa we help the people right now is it a loyal loyalty to the church we are loyal even the tithes we pay every sunday every month every week we do those things right to the church and such questions father may the correct answer come tonight through these ways as we we make and and and endeavorance to to bring them to the people in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen he's praying for the people because they were asking him questions he said those things are very important but that's not what we call the word of what the prince said the prince said get ready now that life must manifest itself what the prince said your preparations the way you conduct yourself the way you do things the way you are no more angered you are no more upset you are no more you have changed since the day the prince told you the wait right you can say it but you will you need to leave it every day right let's go further then jesus said visions went out to meet christ some of them fell asleep huh the first watch second one and the second third fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch but in the seventh watch then came before the sound behold the bridegroom comet going out to meet him and the ones that that were sleeping awakened all the age back to pentecost woke up see from the seventh age the seventh such age all the way back through woke up and this that way in the church age living they were changed and they went in and the very time and every time they went in the sleeping visions came and said we want to buy some of your oil and they said no ways your preparation is out you cannot tell me now in the 11th hour it's not even the 11th hour anymore you are still wanting to buy oil that's that was a right decision right that comes from the the sermon called is your life with you of the gospel right let's go forward is your life worthy of the gospel again we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way can you see why we've got to be led by the lord jesus christ if we don't we take an organizational life if we don't we just take shakina tabernacle life beautiful people you know when you come to their country they'll even bring you dishes and food and everything wonderful people you know they'll drive you with their cars from the airport they'll do anything for you that's wonderful right but and a life that doesn't follow christ daily those things are not worthy i'm not worth doing they're good those are good deeds but at the bottom of those things there must be a day hourly life of me preparing to meet my prince right no matter the circumstances he can come from all the angles the devil that must be my preparation amen well i'm gonna read for you now from another spoken word why is it that so many christians find it so hard to live a christian life that is a question of a ceremony the prophet told i like that i like the titles of the prophet don't you like that why is it that so many christians find it so hard to live the christian life why he's not saying why is it that so why is it that unbelievers find it hard people who are drinking no it's not asking about them he's asking about christians why is it that christians you hear visions who went to meet him why is it that they did not prepare the oil didn't they know that lamp uses oil didn't they know they knew and they were told i'm sure they were told get enough oil for without the oil no lamp will go bright without the oil no bridegroom how will you meet him with a lamp that is dark don't kill you out because in those days it was just the arrangement come with the oil i can't come to my wedding i said brother ben we must come with a black suit and a red tie then you come with a yellow tie you you want him to mix up with you must come with red one amen so the point is they knew they were supposed to have the oil but they did not prepare it and we don't want to find ourselves in that predicament and and the worst part of it is that we say we have the oil how ignorant can that be we need to make sure and double sure that we have the oil why because no man can be pregnant and not know that he's pregnant you have to know that you have the holy ghost and the holy ghost in you will manifest its life every day it cannot be that everywhere every year every month we are struggling from the same thing every sunday in sunday out yeah in year out you still have the problem of temper huh why i had problems of temper before all of us no one because we were born with it when we were born you were an orphan like that girl but the prince came my temper was no more an issue no more hallelujah let's let's hear what the prophet says and today i'm not gonna keep you low i promise you you get a new spirit now let's go back to ezekiel the prophet he wants to talk about that this is beautiful the pastor priest about it here some time ago oh was it brother indy it i i almost jumped over my chair because that's what the prophet says he says you see the lord gives you a new spirit huh a new nature then on top of that he pulls his spirit on top of it because you see with this nature i won't be able i won't be able to live for him so now now we don't want to end up where we're just good people we are just changed we're just morally good people why there's so many good people out there brother marion some of them are better than me and you why good good people you think you can just take them and pluck them in heaven the way they are so nice better than me and you but that's just up to where god changes and give you a spirit his spirit now he must give you his spirit and then from there poor his spirit it sounds confusing there while we were reading that as again i'll change give you a heart of flesh and a flesh you know so you need to read it not with these eyes with the new eyes now the prophet says is you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you see what the new spirit does you get the new spirit you quit your drink you quit you're lying you get a new spirit you see you can do most anything with that spirit most anything but that isn't what god is talking about it's not me my brothers and sisters it's not me that's what the prophecy he says but that is not what god is talking about just coming to church doing what i can't tell you about drinking none of you is drinking i can't tell you about those things those are there we cannot just come to church we cannot just talk about the message and say we and just say we believe it no it's not that there must come a time where he said a new spirit he said i will give you now watch i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit a new heart a new spirit come why because they say in the olden days when they were making wine you know you know they say that says you can't put new one in an old uh an old uh skin because the whole skin is going to when that wine the stimulation of the one because that new spirit when it comes not coming to play he's not coming for jokes just to talk and say i'm a believer no he's going to tell people in the train and say hey my sister you know tonight i tell the lady i was sitting next to him i worked with you i said hey today i'm going to she said what is your plan what what what is because you know people want to know every friday they ask what is your plan what are you going to do i said no no tonight i'm going to church and i'm and you know what i'm going to preach i said hey tonight i'm joined on my youtube and my phone was off i wanted to give her the youtube link to watch right she said i'm going to say it was a strange thing for but he didn't want to appear surprised i said tonight i'm going to church she said three times a week i said no no wednesdays wednesdays and sundays every every day every week i go there so now the point i was trying to say is that you can't take a new wine and put it in old skin when the fermentation comes in fermentation when it comes the stimulation of that wine when it start to really get closer to where quality wine is supposed to be that skin the old skin of that bottle is going to break it's going to pop the prophet says somewhere and you lose the bottle and the wine so it must be a new heart that god gives you then so that when he pours his spirit in there it's in a new bottle when the wine spawns that spirit can contain it you see it can manage it can take it and get ready for the prince to come i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit why he would have to give you a new spirit to live for him you see that one you can do almost anything you're a wonderful boy you're a wonderful girl wonderful brother and sister you see so now let's let's let's just continue there and see how far am i why you have had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit it is that's continuation of the previous one why is because you have an awful spirit me and you were born with awful spirits from the day that we were born we were born with it but he has to give us a new spirit i'll give you a new heart a new spirit now watch and i'll put my spirit in you there's the that's the difference there's the difference i'll put my spirit in you and that's what we are after because it does it is that spirit that is going to manage or live in you every minute every hour without you even doing nothing it is that spirit working inside you bride because you are great he gave you a new heart amen notice now i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit notice the new heart is to put right in the middle of you and the new spirit is to put right in the middle of your new heart did you hear that that new spirit is going to sit right in the middle of the new heart and his spirit is put right in the middle of sorry i'm just i just pissed it twice there i must have been excited so it it's the holy spirit that does it god holy spirit in the middle of your new spirit it makes the middle church operate it makes the whole church that whole church we move now from you as a person the whole church that is comes the center post of the church that spirit when it comes huh as the church we've got a new spirit and then he put a new spirit we've got previously wherever we were gathering we were not behaving the way we are now we were not we're behaving according to the traditions according to the upbringing of our churches if you could gather us like this then and just happen to coincidentally bring us together oh man come on we would we wouldn't spend two hours together back then god had to bring us and give us a new spirit and put us here and say change our nature the way we look at things and then he pour his spirit in there right in the center of our hearts let's read the yellow part it's our life ticking and that the prophet is talking about the watch you know he says the watch a watch it's got all the tools around it inside the watch for the bench called that beautiful one there is that watch inside it it has got a lot of things and machines and but there's a spring that is on the center of the watch that is actually taking and controlling every mechanism in that watch that's what you're talking about every other thing that is important but without that spring that watch my brother will get laid to work it won't work it's holding everything tight together on time every day every second every hour that's how important that spring is and that is the holy spirit that spirit god puts it on top right right do do you understand my thought brothers and sisters i just want to be very slow for you to get the point that it is not about just coming to church it is not that i'm going to get married it is not just i'm going to i'm going to get married no when he come if you're going to get married it must be seen that you are preparing to get married what is the use because he's going to come here and he will be embarrassed he's going to come here with messengers with karaokes with cars nice everything prepared and he find that you are not ready when he is coming i told you let me prepare i told you i'm getting married and you are starting to get prepared to look for the oil at the time but all this time you have been telling people that you are a believer and you are going to heaven telling them about the rapture in faith telling them about spiritual food in jew season but not eating the food that's that's that's detrimental if you operate yourself in closing let's read john you see at the center of this woman it's relationship with the prince at the center that spirit i'm talking about is god himself that spirit i'm talking about is love huh that spirit i'm talking about it is centered around love it is love is god himself you cannot be able to separate the holy spirit god and love you can't because he's one and the same he's him the holy spirit love that is at the center she didn't just say oh i love you prince and no is it you no no she felt truly fell in love with him she loved him they connected huh one day i asked a friend of mine and then i said man when are you getting married i think you must get married he says no no no no no i must get a spark first see that girl got a spark a spark came from that day he didn't look to him as a prince he looked to him as a my lover the one that is everybody was looking at him as a prince the rich guy the son of the king no that's not how he he knew he's like that he knew but he was looking at him at personal level a relationship that the one that i love the ma the one who means the world to me that's how she was looking at him that's how she was talking about him when they said the prince he says no no my sweetheart so yes i mean my hobby they were tired of her and she was not tired of telling them love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him you see it's about love brothers and sisters it's about our manifest the manifestation of god's love in us that's the one not much about what we say every day our life must reflect what we say if he does everything we take the reverse formula and we find that it does not give us c minus b is not giving us a then that's where you need to be honest with yourself for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world so what is the love of the world we all know is the things of the world nowadays the enemy is subtle very subtle he won't come and bring you make you you'll be a good person but no life he'll just make you to go and just you know he set up the world and the earth we are living in set it up in such a way that you will be trapped believer just to keep you until they say oh wake up the prince is here then you say oh then he said oh he's here are you ready now the devil he's gonna say are you ready you said you are the bride that's a painful thing eh oh don't we need it friends what to examine ourselves today to make our salvation and our calling sure examine ourselves today examine it by the weight not what brother paul says not by one brother then saying sorry brother you're in the front out also people won't marry you not bible brother marion says no no not what brother phil says but what brother phil leaves he examines himself according to the word he takes the way he lives he takes the weight take the way he leaves nobody's gonna examine you nobody must examine me i must examine myself according to the word and how can i examine myself according to do it if i'm not digging in the weight you know people there's some people that when you talk to them they they hear you selectively my wife says i used to struggle with that he tells me something then i tell her something because because i selectively chose what i wanted to hear and i tell it no we cannot selectively eat the word of god no no no just to find a scripture to tell brother chris that ever the christ you see they said you can't sit like this you see this but the prophet said no no no giving me a head of a chicken you're not giving me a chicken give me the old chicken give me the old chicken then i'll take the feathers myself do not give me a fair say see this this is this is no no no no give me the whole thing and by the way each and every one of you here have eaten full chicken hello one if you have ever eaten an egg you have eaten a full chicken hello sorry that's not relevant to what i'm saying but we need to examine ourselves according to their weight now sorry this might the next slide might be a little hard but the prophet always said you see brother and sister this is also hard for me i i don't mean to be hard to you it is because i love you it is because you are so important to god to a point whereby the way you know well in the world a young man kneels and says can i marry you him he he humbled himself well more than that and he came to earth and he became a filthy and well like us he was poor than most of us poor did not even have his own place where they say he can go and sleep there but today we have got a king bed you just press it and then the pillow comes today the lord was not like that he didn't have those things he did not have an iphone and he came why because that was an important lady there was an important lady that he wanted to come and say will you marry me he even died just look at what kind of a proposal is that one he even dies and say i'm dying because i've come to fetch you the way that you are seeing me going just know i'm gonna come the same way will you be ready hallelujah may god help us sorry now and a man or woman that professes to be a christian and don't live that kind of life by the grace of god is is a jim son jameson weed i don't know what is that it's not any dictionary this is i'm sure it's kentucky in language is that jameson weight must be a bad thing that wheat by their fruits you shall know them and i'm saying to you by your fruits you will know yourself nobody will come and know you you will know me me you we must know ourselves by our fruits the fruits of the word must manifest in ourselves and that's how we examine ourselves according to the word don't be soft on yourself when it comes to the word of god no no no no i know i understand that they say there's legalistic people and they say liberal people we are not none of those things we are god children whether legal whether liberal but we are walking in the middle of the road right we cannot shy away from talking to one another and say no no we we we we in chicago we are we are not like other churches you know we are we are no no no no we can't we afford to tell one another truth the truth and then encourage one another if brother ben says brother hey i saw you driving fast and you passed me brother and that speed limit there was a hundred i don't think you were going hundred should i say no brother ben you are legalistic no i should say thank you brother for correcting me i appreciate your love from from that time onward that way that he said is going to help me to change you see so now now in new zealand we we we we don't want to tell sorry i'm just picking on the country because i've observed that we don't want just to be direct and say no no my friend this this is not according to the word of god don't do that do you the prophet here do you remember the prophet said this this unless i don't understand you my brother this is not according to what the prophet said the prophet said you must drive within the spirit limit was illegalistic there he says she said jim's on wheat finishing now but by their fruits you shall know them now i'm saying by our by our fruits fruit is our daily life that we people are eating from us are they sweet are they the fruits of the spirit from me and not week in week out you know the papa chris works we in we regard not like that no no full time shift first to the 31st monday to friday 24 hours by the grace of god and me and you we can't do it brothers and sisters only the spirit of god can do it in us what we need to cry for and i tell my children i say hey be wise the bible says be wise if you don't have something and you see you are lacking in this area isn't it the bible said ask for anything now what is anything yeah and you realize that amen i'm even failing to ask the lord what should you do you should ask the lord to help you to help you to be able to ask the lord i'm failing to just to sit and ask you can you help me to ask you the lord god does anything he's gonna help you to be able to ask lord help me it is very difficult for me to accept when when when the word is preaching along this area lord can you with an open heart open my eyes open my heart for me to see right let us be bendable by the word of god right ask anything and he will give it to you if that thing isn't in your heart there's no record of what you are somewhere else if that thing is in your heart best record of so what is the prophet saying he's trying to say everything that is in your heart that comes out it is a reflection of what you are that's why i was saying it's hard because sometimes like you can't say ah you're talking to me like that that's a reflection of who you are no no no you don't talk like that but the reflection of what comes out of my heart by myself that is a reflection of what comes from in here and we should be able to say hey yes brother don't don't don't be soft on yourself and say no no no no no that's not just white washi it must be that hey yes the word of god is correcting me as an individual if sorry i wanted to point you if is evil it best record that you are down here when you die you'll you'll have to go to you'll have to go to where you are already if you are good and you are you are your good because god has made you good you are you are born again you are bound to go that way because the life will have to bear record with this place if it bears record here of here that's where you go there's no two ways about it it's either left or right i'm not being legalistic it's either left or right if it bears record up there that's where you go is either there good dog or the dead dog right side of the good or the bed dog the one that i feed the most goes now amen means let it be so may god bless us and may god help us that we can think of that young lady in the words of the prince and to us every day and our formula to give us the same answer that way or that way same answer and in that way i can assure you that when he comes because the world that we are living in now is finished in that spoken word of is the is your life worthy of the gospel the prophet was saying the word reality is finished it's gone and the prophet was saying this in one spoken word in 63 but it is done it is done i think it was a it was this one this spoken word is your life your life with the gospel says it's finished and and i was reading about these countries china and them it's just coming to a point where it's going to an end now and what the prophet said is happening and it's going to happen all these things have covered and everything these are just the beginning it's the beginning we are at the end of the end and when that girl head realized let's say the princess is going to come on the 25th of december when that girl realized that i'm now going into october tomorrow is october you know what she was getting more excited the preparations were getting polished because she can see we can see now that china there's wars there's rumors of wars everywhere it's time for us to get excited to get ready for our gown everything to be in place in our individual life and if you see your brother pray pray for him cry for him help him amen don't go criticize him and label him no love him even more because that is part and parcel of the preparations you are pulling him in the book of hebrews the prophet said if he draws a little circle for himself there you draw a big circle to encapsulate him hallelujah i'm actually finished may we just stand and the musicians can come the lord bless you richly amen the musicians can come if i didn't speak something right please forgive me all i'm trying to say to you let us get ready for the master is coming our prince is around the corner we are not of this world we are the oddballs we are not from here we are coming from god and we are going back to god amen and by the way that song that i said i love the most you forgot it there's a song that blesses me so much and sister chantal also likes it sorry oh no it's not
