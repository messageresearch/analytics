[4:59] god bless your Saints it's good to be in
[5:01] the house of the Lord amen hallelujah
[5:04] you know we're gonna sing a song I just
[5:07] want to thank you Lord for letting me
[5:09] hear your word you know what a privilege
[5:12] and what an honor it is that God rich
[5:15] and mercy would let me hear his word and
[5:18] you know I believe that when John saw
[5:22] the word open and saw the lamb take the
[5:25] book and it said that everything in
[5:27] heaven and under the earth and on the
[5:30] earth heard me rejoicing because he saw
[5:34] that he was part of God's plan that God
[5:37] had let him see his word amen and so as
[5:40] we sing the song just put yourself in
[5:42] John's shoes and Revelation chapter five
[5:45] and let all heavens let all the hell and
[5:48] let everyone on the earth hear you
[5:50] saying blessing honor power strength
[5:53] mine and glory be unto Him who has
[5:56] prevailed to take the book you know he's
[5:59] a human a man he took Redemption back
[6:02] into the hands of a human being himself
[6:04] because God became the human and now we
[6:07] can have Redemption now we can be
[6:09] raptured
[6:09] now the earth can have a Redemption
[6:12] because of what he did amen
[6:14] and one more thing before we start just
[6:17] to give you a perspective of what we
[6:19] have and who we have when Mary went to
[6:22] the tomb that day when it was all
[6:24] changing and you know when she turned
[6:27] around after she had seen there who the
[6:30] Lord not laying there anymore she's
[6:31] looking for his body when she turned
[6:33] around she didn't see a a Bible School

[6:38] didn't see something si she saw a person
[6:42] amen and when that person spoke her name
[6:45] she came to her identity a manner so

[42:50] up against the people for they're
[42:51] stronger than we be and they brought up
[42:56] an evil report of the land which they
[42:58] had searched under the children of
[42:59] Israel saying the land which we had God
[43:02] to search it at his land that eateth up
[43:03] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[43:05] that saw we saw in it a men of great
[43:08] stature and there we saw the Giants the
[43:10] son of anak which came of the Giants and
[43:14] we were in our own sight as grasshoppers
[43:15] and so we were in their sight
[43:19] amen may the Lord blesses word you may
[43:21] have your seats now I want to and we're
[43:27] going to come into it later but I want
[43:28] to talk about standing your ground and
[43:30] defeating your wallow you don't want to
[43:33] you want to get rid of your wallow and
[43:35] so I'm going to go into that today
[43:37] Helu you know it's amazing when you know
[43:41] basically the devil left but he but he
[43:44] left his bags so you know be with me
[43:49] amen delivery can be slow so does Amen
[43:54] but praise the Lord now it's amazing
[43:56] when you look at this report we're so
[43:58] little was put on how great the land was
[44:00] this land was filled with milk and honey
[44:03] they even brought the evidence back but
[44:06] they spent their time looking at the
[44:08] negative I'd like to stand in Caleb's
[44:11] shoes and Joshua's shoes for a moment we
[44:14] they said were able to go up at once and
[44:16] take it and possess it were able to
[44:18] overcome it no doubt they were looking
[44:21] at the promise they were looking at how
[44:23] good the land was and we know that we
[44:25] have entered into a a new age of bride
[44:28] age where brother Brown says in the
[44:30] invisible Union he says the Pilgrim
[44:33] Fathers were very thankful for their
[44:34] newfound way of life this is when they
[44:36] left Europe and went to went to America
[44:39] being separated from the Old English
[44:42] denominations and Creed they could marry
[44:44] to the new anointed word for their age
[44:46] that's right the new anointed word for
[44:48] their age for the day so we can be
[44:51] thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[44:54] separated ourselves from the things of
[44:56] the world all of our associates Abraham
[44:59] was a pilgrim God has separated us from
[45:02] all the dead religions I'm speaking
[45:04] across the nation now all the dead
[45:06] Creed's and to what separated us and
[45:08] open to us a new land the message for
[45:11] this day so he's opened a new land for
[45:14] us he's opened his word for us I mean a
[45:16] land has come open before us and it's a
[45:19] glorious land there's a resurrection in
[45:21] the land there's healing in the land
[45:23] there's redemption in the land there's
[45:25] peace in the land there's joy in the
[45:27] land
[45:27] amen there's joy and peaceful yo joy
[45:30] unspeakable full of glory I'm in this
[45:33] rest I'm in this overcoming power
[45:35] there's deliverance there's a rapture I
[45:38] mean there's all things I mean Jesus
[45:40] Christ is the land the son of man is the
[45:42] land hallelujah so he's opened up he's
[45:45] opened up a new message a new word for
[45:47] this day I mean which is the word has
[45:49] come open to us the Bible has become
[45:51] open to us as a new book it's not a book
[45:53] of mystery we're not wondering what's in
[45:56] it we're not wondering what belongs to
[45:57] us we know what belongs to us in the
[45:59] land hallelujah we know the land belongs
[46:01] to us we're not worried about what the
[46:03] enemy may try and put there and try and
[46:04] push us back I mean it belongs to you
[46:07] and I so we should press in and take
[46:09] every part of that land hallelujah so
[46:11] we've been I mean so we have we have
[46:14] been separated God has separate us from
[46:16] all dead man's religion I mean that we
[46:18] are united we are married for the
[46:20] anointed word for our age which is Jesus
[46:22] Christ the word hallelujah
[46:25] that's why they were thankful that's why
[46:27] we're thankful
[46:28] amen so now and then the brother Bram
[46:33] also says he sees in the message proving
[46:37] his word he said by God in the midst of
[46:41] all of it he raised up a prophet a son
[46:43] of a priest speaking of John the Baptist
[46:46] here went into the wilderness at nine
[46:47] years old couldn't read his name if it
[46:50] wasn't the leader the size of a boxcar
[46:52] why why did he do it he was a prophet if
[46:55] he had been trained in the education of
[46:57] his father he probably would have been a
[46:59] Pharisee or said you see or one of their
[47:00] groups but he had an important job it
[47:03] was to announce the Messiah because why
[47:05] God kept his word and proved it a voice
[47:07] of one crying from the seminary know
[47:10] behold I've got my doctor's degree that
[47:12] might have been in the old lady birthday
[47:14] Almanac but not in God's Word he said
[47:17] the voice of one crying in the
[47:18] wilderness prepare the way the Lord make
[47:21] his paths straight was he preparing the
[47:23] way of the word then that word can be
[47:25] made manifest hallelujah don't you see
[47:28] in the shadows stop here for a minute in
[47:30] the last days there's got to be a place
[47:32] prepared for the word to be made
[47:34] manifest and we're now living by the
[47:36] evidence of the new man new land amen
[47:39] the son of man I mean so we're living by
[47:41] the evidence of the new land Jesus
[47:43] Christ himself hallelujah now it's a
[47:47] glorious land hallelujah
[47:50] healing is in the land divine healing is
[47:53] in the land we've seen healing among us
[47:55] as the children's bread it belongs to us
[47:57] I'm in redemptions in the land the body
[47:59] changes in the land joy is in the land
[48:02] but you've got to stand in your land
[48:04] you've got to put you got to possess
[48:06] your land you can't let the enemy come
[48:08] in and come in like a flood and just
[48:10] take over you've got to stand amen in
[48:13] your land and we see we're just going to
[48:15] read this from SiC and Samuel I mean
[48:19] here's here's the I know I've spoken
[48:21] along these lines before but here we
[48:23] have the account of David's mighty men
[48:26] this is these be the names of the mighty
[48:29] men whom David had the attachment night
[48:32] that sent in the seat chief among the
[48:33] captains the same was a do that is night
[48:36] he lifted up a spear against eight
[48:38] hundred whom he slew and after him was
[48:42] le
[48:42] the son of a dodo the o'night one of the
[48:47] mighty men with David when they defied
[48:49] the Philistines that were gathered to
[48:51] give it to battle and the men of Israel
[48:53] were gone away he arose and smote the
[48:54] Philistines until his hand was weary and
[48:57] his hand claimant of the sword and the
[48:59] Lord brought a great victory that day
[49:01] and the people returned after him only
[49:04] to spoil and after him was Shama the son
[49:08] of eggie the Hara right and the
[49:10] Philistines were gathered together into
[49:12] a troop when where was a piece of ground
[49:14] full of lentils and the people fled from
[49:16] the Philistines but he stood in the
[49:18] midst of the ground and defended it and
[49:20] slew the Philistines and the Lord
[49:22] wrought a great victory you know I read
[49:25] a thing in the paper about training the
[49:27] SAS and the people that go for selection
[49:30] to the if I knows who the SAS are
[49:32] they're the elite of the army of New
[49:33] Zealand either there are special forces
[49:35] and they train them in such a way that
[49:38] the only way the people can actually get
[49:40] into the SAS is because they have an
[49:42] inner drive they they they take them on
[49:45] training till their physical strength is
[49:47] gone all their reserves are godly mental
[49:50] capacity is God and the only way they
[49:52] can get in is because of an inner drive
[49:54] in them and that's how they get part of
[49:56] that army I mean it's the same thing
[49:58] with the bride I mean there's an inner
[50:00] drive hollow in the believer that when
[50:02] all strength is gone even your
[50:04] understanding is gone you don't know
[50:05] where everything is there's something
[50:07] and you said I'm part of the Lord's army
[50:08] I'm gonna take the Lane I'm going to
[50:10] defeat my enemy hallelujah there's
[50:13] something in you that's greater than
[50:14] your flesh that's greater than the enemy
[50:16] better than your mind I mean it's a seed
[50:18] of God hallelujah have confidence in
[50:21] that seed hallelujah see here they were
[50:24] leave this is not a we did not read a an
[50:26] account of a choreographed battle from
[50:28] Hollywood these are men
[50:30] I mean flesh and blood like you and I
[50:32] but they were anointed they knew their
[50:34] King was empower and was coming into
[50:36] power
[50:36] hallelujah they stood in their land they
[50:39] didn't care what the enemy through them
[50:40] I mean they ain't care if you don't
[50:42] house Lee they stood in their
[50:43] inheritance hallelujah to God and they
[50:46] defeated their enemy now well I just
[50:51] I'll just drop this in before we kind of
[50:53] go another way now it's amazing the word
[50:55] Philistine
[50:56] because I like it when the Bible becomes
[50:59] on our address it's all very well I yes
[51:01] standing your ground part of the root
[51:04] word of Philistine that means to roll in
[51:07] the dust to wallow it's what it's part
[51:10] of the root word of the meaning
[51:11] Philistine it means to to roll in the
[51:14] dust to wallow now a wallow is a place
[51:19] where animals like a pig we see
[51:21] elephants or big big mammals or even you
[51:24] know they gon wallow in in in mud or and
[51:27] water and the purpose of this is it's a
[51:30] place with a lie around roll around in
[51:33] mud or water to keep cool and to avoid
[51:36] biting insects a wallow is a place where
[51:40] an animal visits regularly they have
[51:43] their own wallow they have a place and
[51:46] that wallow as I just said is a place to
[51:50] alleviate to get temporary relief from
[51:54] their current circumstances when the
[51:57] bugs bite too much when the Sun gets too
[51:59] hot they go to their wallow they go to
[52:02] the owal oh remember the Philistines
[52:05] came in the wallow came in the wallow
[52:09] came in right here is this wallowing
[52:11] coming in only if you stood against it
[52:14] others read I can't handle this I can't
[52:19] handle this and they ran there into
[52:21] something else but if you stood and they
[52:24] were stood the wallow I'm not gonna roll
[52:26] in this mud I'm not gonna put up with
[52:28] this I'm not gonna find temporary relief
[52:31] in this mud remember an animal the more
[52:34] that they wallow in a wallow the bit of
[52:36] the Warlow comes because it fits them
[52:37] perfectly it's their size as they shake
[52:40] before the animal rolls in it it's just
[52:42] a bit of water a bit of mud on the
[52:45] ground but then they get in and they
[52:46] roll who's ever seen an animal wallow
[52:49] they they roll they get in there they
[52:52] get in their groove and it just fits
[52:55] them just right and so the wallow is
[52:58] actually made by the animal the wallah
[53:00] doesn't make itself it's the animal
[53:02] rolling there that makes the wallow the
[53:05] more they lie in there and they roll the
[53:07] better and more satisfied they become
[53:08] because it fits them just right
[53:10] right people have many different wallows
[53:15] amen people have many different Wohlers
[53:18] today and they think they're getting
[53:21] temporary relief they have the wallows
[53:24] of movies they have the wallows of music
[53:27] because they're trying to escape people
[53:30] are trying to escape they're you know
[53:31] it's like bugs abiding you I need to
[53:33] escape this situation so I got my Waller
[53:36] and then the bugs don't get me it
[53:38] doesn't take the bugs away doesn't
[53:41] actually change there comes a time rolls
[53:43] on and then the mud gets dried and falls
[53:46] off the bugs come back
[53:47] it doesn't permanently change the
[53:50] situation just gives temporary it's just
[53:52] a temporary escape and people always
[53:54] looking for an escape
[53:56] so movies music the internet is a big
[53:59] wallow you can find anything you want is
[54:03] there a mint often and so this is
[54:09] because they're watering and then people
[54:11] also but the reason people wallow in
[54:14] those things is because they are
[54:17] wallowing in their past or their pain or
[54:21] their pride or their self-pity that's
[54:25] why people wallow amen that's why people
[54:29] work why is people caught up in these
[54:31] things because they're wallowing because
[54:33] something happened to them and so they
[54:37] are wallowing in their part in their
[54:38] past or their pain or their pride or
[54:40] their self pity no one understands me
[54:43] therefore I'll go wallow now I'm not
[54:47] throwing away pain or the past or scars
[54:50] I'm not diminishing those things but
[54:53] what do you do with them do you all owe
[54:55] in them or do you get up or do you just
[55:00] stay in the thing you eat well I'm
[55:02] comfortable this fits me just right they
[55:06] become one with the wall oh the animals
[55:08] do this fits me perfectly I'm used to
[55:10] being here this is the thing we're going
[55:13] to get out to where we we're going to
[55:14] get out from where we used to be our
[55:17] current state of thinking how we think
[55:19] how do people get into a wallows their
[55:21] mind goes a certain way they've trained
[55:23] their thinking
[55:24] it's trained a certain way and you need
[55:26] to say Lord I don't want to be in my
[55:28] Waller how did I end up in this place
[55:31] it's not an accident it's like someone
[55:34] training I know it's very obvious but
[55:36] someone who wins the gold of the
[55:37] Olympics it's not an accident they end
[55:39] up on a podium they train all their
[55:42] whole life is focused to get to that
[55:44] goal and it's the same thing of
[55:45] someone's wallowing in something it's
[55:47] not an accident you're in that place
[55:50] amen I start it's actually there's a
[55:54] motive and a purpose behind it because
[55:56] the devil wants you to wallow he doesn't
[55:59] want you to stand up in your God given
[56:00] inheritance cadiz head off put him on
[56:03] the trophy wall and walk on right he
[56:06] wants you to become his trophy like King
[56:10] Saul became a trophy of the Philistines
[56:12] and their temple because he wallowed in
[56:15] his insufficiency I'm this from the
[56:18] smallest tribe in the country and he had
[56:21] a complex about it and he's so worried
[56:24] about what mental because of that and
[56:26] that's what caused them needed up in
[56:27] that place God doesn't actually set us
[56:30] up to fail right it all depends how you
[56:33] look at the story we know but he was
[56:35] never meant to be King God didn't seal
[56:36] it up seen him up to fail right sorry
[56:40] it's all how you look at the story
[56:41] there's more than one way but you got to
[56:43] look at it God didn't set him up to fail
[56:45] God wanted Israel to succeed and God
[56:48] never sets us up to fail he wants us to
[56:50] succeed he wants us to take a body
[56:52] change he wants the devil to be under
[56:54] your feet he wants him to always be
[56:57] under your feet he wants the devil to be
[56:59] in his place under you that's what God
[57:01] wants for you he wants you to be the
[57:04] manifestation of his word in victory
[57:09] that's what God wants he doesn't send us
[57:11] up to fail but it all depends how we
[57:14] react we are not called to wallow get
[57:20] out of your wall oh don't be comfortable
[57:22] in your wallet amen don't worship your
[57:26] past or your pride or your pain or
[57:28] yourself pity whatever it may be
[57:29] get up what are you doing down there
[57:32] what am i well this happened to me yeah
[57:34] but the Lord is our refuge
[57:36] the Lord is our healer the
[57:38] Lord as our Redeemer the Lord allows
[57:40] things to happen to us write the name of
[57:42] the Lord is a strong tower
[57:44] you know the wallet now I wouldn't call
[57:46] this but you know what our wallah really
[57:48] is I mean the city of refuge Christ
[57:50] Jesus that is the place we should be
[57:53] that is the place we're cool to runnin
[57:55] to hallelujah that is the place that we
[57:58] are can running at us safe
[58:00] amen so running to Jesus Christ the word
[58:03] he is our city of refuge hallelujah we
[58:06] don't need to worry about you and the
[58:08] devil says what does know that that
[58:10] won't work whatever you know worthy it
[58:12] doesn't matter the person was different
[58:14] when they ran to the city they were
[58:16] nasty he worthy to be in this place that
[58:18] you knew is the case against them and
[58:19] they were pointed to that place and they
[58:21] ran and hallelujah it doesn't matter
[58:23] what we think we are there's a city and
[58:25] it's open right into the place you're
[58:27] safe hallelujah that's all you need to
[58:30] do they wouldn't examine what lineage
[58:32] what you passed
[58:32] what's your bank account what's your
[58:34] education well yeah the kids they ran in
[58:38] they were safe hallelujah so now we we
[58:43] have to defeat these things now David
[58:45] was anointed to become king we know that
[58:48] that was not a that was not a mystery
[58:51] when he was anointed by vindicated
[58:54] prophet a ordained prophet Samuel
[58:57] anointed him we know that he was
[58:59] ordained to become king it wasn't a
[59:02] mystery that he was going to become King
[59:03] when he was anointed and if we were
[59:06] there and we really believed samuel was
[59:08] the prophet for the Aged we would have
[59:11] said well it's a foregone conclusion
[59:12] he's going to become king right because
[59:15] we believe that was Samuel doing right
[59:17] but a king is not a king unless he has
[59:20] subjects and a kingdom and last but not
[59:25] least a queen he can't be a king if I
[59:28] put a crown on my head and say I'm the
[59:29] king of New Zealand it said no you made
[59:33] prove it now I'm the king
[59:35] I believe it but I've just got a crown
[59:37] on my head in these I got no
[59:39] jurisdiction I got no I don't have a you
[59:41] know I don't have a kingdom nothing's
[59:44] established under my hand no it's going
[59:46] to be manifested right so so it wasn't
[59:50] but it wasn't a mystery
[59:52] David was going to become king after he
[59:54] is anointed but part of him becoming
[59:56] King was Bathsheba becoming becoming his
[1:00:00] Queen right his mighty men his subjects
[1:00:03] rallying under him they weren't there
[1:00:05] when he was anointed but they were part
[1:00:07] of the prophecy they were part of that
[1:00:09] anointing right so now the mystery so so
[1:00:14] they were part though the mighty mean we
[1:00:17] read about they were part of him being
[1:00:20] anointed right Bathsheba was part of him
[1:00:23] becoming king they weren't included when
[1:00:26] Samuel said I know you to be king and
[1:00:29] that and these people will gather too
[1:00:30] you know but they were part of that
[1:00:32] anointing right because when David
[1:00:34] because those are gathered to David and
[1:00:37] followed him the same anointing that was
[1:00:39] upon him fell upon them right that's why
[1:00:42] they did the mighty acts of war fee they
[1:00:45] did has because the same anointing that
[1:00:47] caused David to kill Goliath came upon
[1:00:49] them and they killed their enemies too
[1:00:51] hallelujah and that was really the proof
[1:00:54] that they were following that they
[1:00:56] believed that David was becoming King
[1:00:57] because the same anointing came upon
[1:00:59] them hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:01:02] with us now the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:04] the anointing that was on the bridegroom
[1:01:06] is on the bride right they're the same
[1:01:08] life the same victory comes upon comes
[1:01:11] upon her as well as if one happy this
[1:01:13] morning
[1:01:13] can we just rejoice hallelujah we're
[1:01:16] gonna win I've read the end we're gonna
[1:01:18] win hallelujah it's all good
[1:01:21] amen so now the Messiah the Messiah
[1:01:25] coming to the earth was prophesied since
[1:01:27] Eden right God Himself promised the
[1:01:30] serpent promised you know I'm gonna the
[1:01:32] seat of the woman's gonna come in and do
[1:01:34] what you've done hallelujah and also in
[1:01:38] the scripture was the place place of his
[1:01:40] birth the type of ministry had the
[1:01:43] manner of his death his resurrection
[1:01:44] yeah all those things were included but
[1:01:47] part of that so it was all sitting in
[1:01:50] the scripture to be manifested but the
[1:01:53] mystery of the hidden part was Peter
[1:01:55] James and John right they were part of
[1:01:57] his ministry the woman at the well
[1:01:59] Legion Timothy they were seven Church
[1:02:02] ages there was a fivefold ministry
[1:02:03] through the ages he was
[1:02:05] bride Barrow part of the prophecy right
[1:02:08] just like Adam was manifested upon the
[1:02:10] earth there was man and woman in him but
[1:02:12] the mystery in him was was Eve right so
[1:02:16] she was headed in him and even and then
[1:02:19] and then when then she was manifested so
[1:02:21] the mystery was revealed right she was
[1:02:24] part of him having dominion over the
[1:02:27] earth and so now as I said the Lord
[1:02:30] coming the first time having a gentle
[1:02:33] you know Peter James and John they were
[1:02:35] part of his ministry the Apostles are
[1:02:37] part of his ministry the woman at the
[1:02:39] well Legion Timothy as I see the seventh
[1:02:41] church ages the Apostle Paul they were
[1:02:43] all part of of his ministry but they
[1:02:46] were the unexpressed hidden part but
[1:02:48] then when he came she was revealed the
[1:02:50] bride was big revealed hallelujah
[1:02:54] no I see if I have this now season Luke
[1:03:03] 2 31 32 now if you read the whole
[1:03:06] account of look this is this is Jesus
[1:03:08] being taken to the temple one of my
[1:03:10] favorite pieces of scripture as a baby
[1:03:11] to be circumcised dedicated to the Lord
[1:03:13] and Simon it says earlier in the in the
[1:03:17] chapter Simon is an old man he's there
[1:03:19] in the and the assuming whatever his
[1:03:21] name is you go read it if pronounce
[1:03:23] things better than me you know he's
[1:03:24] there and the Lord has told him that he
[1:03:26] will not die till he sees the Lord's
[1:03:28] Christ and the Holy Ghost comes upon him
[1:03:30] and he's led straight to the baby there
[1:03:32] straight to the Christ child and so he's
[1:03:34] speaking it's the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:03:36] through him saying which thou has
[1:03:38] prepared before the face of all people a
[1:03:40] light to lighten the Gentiles and the
[1:03:43] glory of thy people Israel and he says
[1:03:46] before this behold lit by servant depart
[1:03:48] in peace because mine eyes have seen thy
[1:03:50] salvation so now he is saying that the
[1:03:53] Lord is speaking through him saying that
[1:03:55] he is the light to lighten the Gentiles
[1:03:57] but now but you see but in the book of
[1:04:00] Acts
[1:04:00] x13 47 this is Paul and Silas speaking
[1:04:04] to the Jews it says for as much as the
[1:04:06] lord commander saying I have set thee to
[1:04:09] be a light of the Gentiles thou should
[1:04:11] us be for salvation unto the ends of the
[1:04:13] earth now some people read this they say
[1:04:16] well Paul you're actually just taking
[1:04:18] Scripture that's apply
[1:04:19] Jesus trying to apply it to yourself to
[1:04:21] make yourself something right right
[1:04:26] kindly that's what people would say this
[1:04:28] but that is not what it's saying it's
[1:04:30] that because the same God I mean Jesus
[1:04:32] the word was manifested as our Redeemer
[1:04:35] he continuing his ministry through the
[1:04:38] seven church ages and their ministry
[1:04:40] started to the Gentiles with Paul and
[1:04:43] Silas so they were Jesus in them was the
[1:04:46] light to the Gentiles so it was a
[1:04:48] continuation of his ministry but then
[1:04:50] when when when when Simon held him in
[1:04:52] the temple is an eight-year-old boy I
[1:04:54] mean I mean a eighth day a day old boy
[1:04:58] baby
[1:04:58] when he said this what wasn't a mystery
[1:05:02] here's the baby but Paul and Silas were
[1:05:03] the mystery right they were part of that
[1:05:06] as a continuation of that lujah right so
[1:05:10] you follow me on there so now I put this
[1:05:13] up to show you this the unexpressed part
[1:05:16] is the hidden part down through the Old
[1:05:18] Testament there's a mystery of a Gentile
[1:05:20] bride pointing to you Allu you so now as
[1:05:30] I said Peter James and John the woman at
[1:05:33] the well Legion Timothy all the
[1:05:36] believers Lydia the seller of purple
[1:05:38] Dorcas all the ones in the scripture
[1:05:39] priscilla and aquila they were the N
[1:05:41] Express prior but they were part of the
[1:05:43] prophecy right that part of the word
[1:05:46] that had to be manifested in the day
[1:05:48] hallelujah and I'm so glad
[1:05:50] now when the anointing falls it just
[1:05:52] shows what's in the person I mean many
[1:05:56] times people will read Hebrews 6:4 2:9
[1:05:59] and they will see it as a negative thing
[1:06:00] because it says for it's impossible for
[1:06:02] those who were once enlightened and have
[1:06:03] tasted the heavenly gift and made
[1:06:05] partakers of the Holy Ghost and have
[1:06:07] tasted the good word of God and the
[1:06:09] powers of the world to come if they
[1:06:11] shall fall away - and you again
[1:06:12] themselves unto repentance seeing they
[1:06:14] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:06:17] afresh and put him to an open shame for
[1:06:20] the earth with drinketh in the rain that
[1:06:22] come off upon it and bringeth forth
[1:06:24] herbs meat for them by Hermits dressed
[1:06:27] receiveth blessing from God but that
[1:06:29] which bear of thorns and briers is
[1:06:31] rejected as Niantic
[1:06:33] whose end is to be burned but beloved we
[1:06:36] are frustrated bitter things of you the
[1:06:38] things that accompany salvation though
[1:06:41] we thus speak see saying that the rain
[1:06:43] falls speaking of the spirit it falls on
[1:06:46] the ground and it brings forth the life
[1:06:49] of the seed in the ground hallelujah so
[1:06:53] it just brings out what's really in
[1:06:55] someone hallelujah and we should look at
[1:06:58] this as a negative thing I mean what did
[1:07:01] it bring out of you the rain of the
[1:07:03] Spirit when the word fell on you what
[1:07:05] did it produce hallelujah and either
[1:07:08] produced a a a Brier with thorns or
[1:07:12] herbs meat for the improvement stretched
[1:07:14] hallelujah and produced a life
[1:07:15] hallelujah
[1:07:17] so at rest you can rejoice o Lord your
[1:07:20] spreads fallen your words came upon me
[1:07:21] and it's brought up your life it's
[1:07:24] brought out the wheat it's brought out
[1:07:26] not a tear or a thistle
[1:07:28] let's brought out your life and me
[1:07:30] hallelujah and that's why you've got to
[1:07:32] be born again I mean it's not about
[1:07:34] making noise in the flesh but God is
[1:07:36] equipping your soul I mean you gotta
[1:07:39] come alive get out of your wallow
[1:07:41] but I like the swallow stand up you know
[1:07:45] me to be wallowing get up the devil
[1:07:47] comes and tries to make you wallow
[1:07:49] you've got to defeat you're wallowing
[1:07:50] but I'm used to the swallow stop being a
[1:07:53] creature of habit God doesn't want us to
[1:07:56] be a creature of bad habits he wants me
[1:07:58] a creature of his word hallelujah amen
[1:08:05] you know there will come a time when the
[1:08:08] Internet is no more Facebook is no more
[1:08:11] youtubers no more the music industry is
[1:08:15] no more sport is no more right there

[1:08:54] righteousness seek his kingdom and his
[1:08:56] righteousness

[1:09:00] in you the new birth Jesus Christ in you
[1:09:03] the word of God in you that is his
[1:09:05] righteous and these things will be added
[1:09:07] many times we try and get the added
[1:09:09] things which we think we need and the
[1:09:10] devil puts us on a treadmill you know
[1:09:12] the treadmills will be no more no people
[1:09:16] you know talking it working these people
[1:09:20] that well they don't work there but
[1:09:22] other people are a boss of a so one of
[1:09:26] my work colleagues her son works up in
[1:09:29] Auckland and her boss she lives here and
[1:09:32] her husband lives in Hong Kong they have
[1:09:35] big careers they only see each other
[1:09:37] once a year but they've given themselves
[1:09:41] to their careers what kind of what kind
[1:09:46] of life is that it'll be but people give
[1:09:49] themselves give themselves to things
[1:09:51] that really don't matter get off the
[1:09:55] wheel you can't you can't finish the
[1:09:58] wheel it keeps turning and you'll find
[1:10:00] people run on a wheel and they say this
[1:10:03] time will be better and it's the same
[1:10:05] rung that they put their foot on before
[1:10:07] and they keep disappointed now we're
[1:10:09] running a bit more and it's the same run
[1:10:11] the same disappointment when I give this
[1:10:13] I'll be happy and you're not happy when
[1:10:15] I give this I'll be happy I'm not happy
[1:10:16] I'm just trying to find my way let him
[1:10:18] find your way let him drink your paw I
[1:10:21] mean he gives us peace and rest that we
[1:10:24] are actually content in our state that
[1:10:27] we find ourselves to be hallelujah why
[1:10:31] are you so relaxed well I meet him why
[1:10:36] are you not worried
[1:10:37] he just nonchalant no I'm relaxed I'm a
[1:10:41] rest because he found me and if he found
[1:10:44] me he's not going to leave me here
[1:10:46] he doesn't just meet you just to tickle
[1:10:48] your religious etch a little but but he
[1:10:51] finds you a mean to take you into a
[1:10:53] rapture hallelujah
[1:10:56] so now it
[1:10:59] the paint's now so Hebrew going back to
[1:11:03] Hebrews six it depends what you identify
[1:11:05] yourself to be are you wheat or you
[1:11:08] tears right I heard a testimony of two
[1:11:12] people after they heard brother Branham
[1:11:14] preach one of them was offended the
[1:11:17] other one wasn't he said it was
[1:11:18] wonderful
[1:11:19] the one who was offended said no he
[1:11:21] called me a buzzard and the one who
[1:11:23] thought it was wonderful said well
[1:11:25] that's funny because he called me an
[1:11:26] eagle so it depends what you hear
[1:11:29] it depends what identifies in you right
[1:11:32] hallelujah and it's not just you and
[1:11:34] yours it's not just the power of
[1:11:36] positive thinking it's God coming and
[1:11:38] identifying what you are a man he says
[1:11:42] we so where we're right at the end time
[1:11:44] we're sitting here at the door now
[1:11:45] waiting for him to come notice God
[1:11:48] promised in his word he would choose his
[1:11:50] bride by his original way but there is a
[1:11:53] way he chose the bridegroom he foretold
[1:11:56] it by the Prophet sent a prophet to
[1:11:58] identify the Prophet said sitting on the
[1:12:00] banks of Jordan behold your they sent
[1:12:03] you're the Messiah Roger he said no I'm
[1:12:05] not the Messiah you must be the Messiah
[1:12:07] but I'm not him but he's standing among
[1:12:09] you and his shoes I'm not worthy to
[1:12:11] loosen when he comes he'll make himself
[1:12:13] known and today he's standing among us
[1:12:16] now just think about this and today he's
[1:12:21] standing among us and the person of the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and
[1:12:25] more coming into his church making
[1:12:27] himself known because he and the bride
[1:12:30] and the groom will be the same making
[1:12:32] himself known and one day you'll see
[1:12:34] that the one that your field in your
[1:12:36] heart and see his identification will
[1:12:39] become personalized before you then you
[1:12:42] and hear one you're united by the word
[1:12:44] and the word was in the beginning we'll
[1:12:46] go back to the beginning which is God
[1:12:48] and in that day you'll know I'm in the
[1:12:50] father the father and me I in you and
[1:12:52] you and me
[1:12:52] hallelujah we're here Holly aces I mean
[1:12:55] that you would know I mean the very one
[1:12:57] that you feel and then will become
[1:12:59] personalized in front of you and you and
[1:13:01] him become one Hollies and that day this
[1:13:04] is the day when you know that I'm in the
[1:13:06] father the father may on you and you and
[1:13:08] me hallelujah
[1:13:10] am identifying himself
[1:13:13] to you now God is building a masterpiece
[1:13:18] those those mighty men were a
[1:13:20] masterpiece hallelujah you read when
[1:13:24] they first gather today but it says
[1:13:25] everyone who was in debt and
[1:13:27] discontented and you know that kind of
[1:13:30] way doesn't say if I knew all together
[1:13:32] those who have been fighting for years
[1:13:34] those who had the great strengths those
[1:13:36] who already mighty men give themselves
[1:13:37] to David those this let's just read that
[1:13:40] let's just read that in 1st Samuel I'm
[1:13:45] so gay I'm so glad God does not know I'm
[1:13:51] gonna get in trouble I'm in seeking Sam
[1:13:53] you okay let's go to 1st Samuel it's not
[1:14:01] on my notes I just okay we're in we're
[1:14:08] in 1st Samuel 22 first one David
[1:14:14] therefore departed thence and escaped
[1:14:16] I will veer to the cave Abdullah and
[1:14:19] when his brethren and all his father's
[1:14:22] house heard it they went down headed to
[1:14:24] him and everyone that was in distress
[1:14:26] and everyone that was in debt and
[1:14:29] everyone that was discontented gathered
[1:14:31] themselves under him and he became a
[1:14:33] captain over them and there were with
[1:14:35] him about 400 men so look at the state
[1:14:38] of that I know I've said there's more
[1:14:39] got to keep these things in front of us
[1:14:41] sometimes look at the state and the
[1:14:42] people that gather to him they're there
[1:14:44] in debt he he paid a debt we could not
[1:14:47] pay right we needed someone to take our
[1:14:50] sins away hallelujah we were distressed
[1:14:53] what's happening to us in this world
[1:14:55] this world is falling apart what's going
[1:14:57] to happen we're at the end time who's
[1:14:59] gonna help me whose goodness hallelujah
[1:15:00] then we gather ourselves to our David
[1:15:02] the Lord Jesus right even there was
[1:15:04] distressed discontented I'm sick of this
[1:15:07] world there's got to be more to this
[1:15:09] world than the 9 to 5 and the I remember

[1:15:17] more than just this and partying and
[1:15:19] friends and whatever and you know then

[1:15:24] never ever quench that thirst never ever
[1:15:29] never ever substitute it with something
[1:15:32] else
[1:15:32] because it will never satisfy and the
[1:15:35] devil tries to hush that holy thirst
[1:15:38] that God put on here anyways puts fear
[1:15:40] you don't want to be like those people I
[1:15:42] would say you want to be like these

[1:19:56] masterpiece of Bride for Christ another
[1:19:58] masterpiece and doings and so doing it

[1:20:27] look what God takes to build a
[1:20:29] masterpiece and we can say oh I'm glad
[1:20:32] I'm and that can't agree a people amen
[1:20:39] we are part of us coming the broadest
[1:20:43] part of the coming seeking coming of
[1:20:45] Jesus Christ and everything in the
[1:20:49] scripture God has been revealed being
[1:20:51] revealing his hidden mystery of the
[1:20:54] coming of the Lord
[1:20:55] now God had a purpose in a hidden
[1:20:57] mystery I'm just gonna I'm just throwing
[1:20:59] these things out here this is from
[1:21:00] Christ a mystery God revealed I trust
[1:21:01] it's very familiar now God had a purpose
[1:21:03] in a hidden mystery that's what I want
[1:21:05] to speak to the church this morning the
[1:21:07] hidden mystery of God that he had in his
[1:21:09] mind before the world even began and how
[1:21:12] its unfolded itself right down to this
[1:21:14] present hour that we're living see then
[1:21:16] you'll understand clearly then you will
[1:21:18] you see this on I believe what is being
[1:21:21] done God's great mystery of hearts a
[1:21:24] secret he's kept it a secret nobody know
[1:21:26] nothing about it
[1:21:27] even the Angels didn't understand it see
[1:21:29] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:21:31] I'll thank you hallelujah it's always
[1:21:35] you get a bit desperate when the water
[1:21:36] runs dry it you never miss the water
[1:21:39] till the well runs dry the UM have you
[1:21:41] heard that have you heard that analogy
[1:21:42] that's true you know we get so used to
[1:21:45] things and you miss it when it's gone
[1:21:47] hallelujah
[1:21:48] now even the Angels didn't understand us
[1:21:50] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:21:52] under our seventh mystery when the
[1:21:53] seventh seal was open they were silenced
[1:21:55] Jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[1:21:57] to know when he would come said not even
[1:21:59] the son of man don't know when it's
[1:22:01] going to happen see God has it all to
[1:22:03] himself it's a secret
[1:22:04] and that's the reason there was silence
[1:22:06] in heaven for a space a half hour and
[1:22:08] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:22:09] and John was even forbidden to write at
[1:22:12] sea the coming of the Lord that's the
[1:22:14] one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how
[1:22:16] he will come and when he will come it's
[1:22:18] a good thing he doesn't know he has
[1:22:21] showed it or revealed it in every type
[1:22:23] that's in the Bible therefore the entire
[1:22:25] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:22:27] in Christ the entire Bible is an
[1:22:29] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:22:32] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:22:33] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[1:22:35] believers in the Bible has been in type
[1:22:37] expressing what God's great dollars and
[1:22:40] now in this last day he has revealed it
[1:22:43] and shows it and God's help will see
[1:22:46] right here this morning what the Lord
[1:22:48] has had in his mind all along and has
[1:22:50] expressed it that's why he'd go back and
[1:22:53] you see God's the coming of Lord was
[1:22:56] shown and David becoming King Solomon
[1:22:58] building the house right with Moses all
[1:23:00] the way down through all the prophets
[1:23:01] down through God was expressing his
[1:23:04] coming and expressing what he would do
[1:23:06] and a lot of the parts he takes a
[1:23:08] Gentile bride hallelujah as a shadow
[1:23:11] pointing to what he'll do and it's

[1:25:31] trees that then thou shall disturb thy
[1:25:35] self and then shall the Lord go out
[1:25:38] before thee to smite the host of the
[1:25:40] Philistines and David did so as the Lord
[1:25:42] had commanded him and smote the
[1:25:44] Philistines from giba even until they'll
[1:25:48] come to to Gaza gazer now notice this

[1:26:56] and the prophet introduces the Lamb of
[1:26:58] God to the people right it's like John

[1:27:27] pull you know taking people by the hand
[1:27:29] or the discernment the second pull now
[1:27:32] we're living under the third pole Christ

[1:27:36] himself with a bride right for a going
[1:27:40] right so we are living at the time when

[1:28:36] it's exciting you know your passport in
[1:28:39] your hand on the visa whatever you

[1:29:16] even miss the book get on the plane the
[1:29:19] plane is Jesus Christ now he says when
[1:29:24] you hear the sound of a gang of the tops
[1:29:25] of the mulberry trees so not at the base
[1:29:27] of the tree not in the middle of the
[1:29:29] tree but at the top of the tree
[1:29:31] now romance brings about the restoration
[1:29:33] of the bride tree right as we see the
[1:29:35] fruit at the top of the tree right he
[1:29:38] says this now he's speaking about the
[1:29:40] restoration it starts and Luther says of
[1:29:42] Luther could have gone on it would have
[1:29:43] been here if weasely would have got on
[1:29:45] if pentecost would have gone on what on
[1:29:48] what would they have done now the only
[1:29:50] one thing can happen there has to be a
[1:29:52] message of the end time when there is
[1:29:54] nothing else can follow it and now the
[1:29:56] key miracle world has set up such a
[1:29:59] regime that there can be no denomination
[1:30:02] or nothing to follow else follow it
[1:30:04] you're either in it or you're not in it
[1:30:06] the fruit is on the top of the tree and
[1:30:08] the light is shining on that
[1:30:10] predestinated fruit and she's ripening
[1:30:12] into christ-like fruit
[1:30:14] bringing forth the same mellowness and
[1:30:16] sweetness and the same spirit that he
[1:30:18] had in him is his hope you see it I
[1:30:21] tried to put too much in one day are we
[1:30:24] you out so look they sold out -
[1:30:26] reasoning sold out the reasonings of
[1:30:28] denomination if I can just belong to
[1:30:30] this my mayor goes to this church if I
[1:30:32] can be a Methodist or a Presbyterian I
[1:30:35] say people sell out the reasonings even
[1:30:37] here
[1:30:38] well my parents go here I just say I
[1:30:40] believe it I go along that's just that's
[1:30:42] not it you got to meet him you're gonna
[1:30:45] meet the master you gotta meet the Lord
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ right I just explained them
[1:30:50] limbs of pruned off they did they're not
[1:30:52] connecting with Christ any more they'd
[1:30:54] be bringing forth the same life and I'll
[1:30:56] connect them whether they act like
[1:30:57] citrus fruit any
[1:30:59] fruit can live in a citrus tree but
[1:31:01] it'll bring its own fruit you put a
[1:31:03] grapefruit an orange tree to live by
[1:31:04] orange tree it'll bring full of
[1:31:06] grapefruit although he sees that the
[1:31:08] northern ones the in time and all the
[1:31:09] father has given me in the roots will
[1:31:11] come to me see you get it oh how we
[1:31:13] should love him adore him praise him to
[1:31:15] see the fruit of the Spirit in the last
[1:31:17] days and a bride tree ripening in the
[1:31:19] top of the time the true vine and the
[1:31:21] false vine both have the same anointing
[1:31:23] the water fell on them both and he sees
[1:31:25] in the visible union he says get ready
[1:31:28] the fires gonna fall one of these days
[1:31:31] God's going to let him come and aside to
[1:31:33] behold would you be ready when he comes
[1:31:36] would you really go up with him when he
[1:31:38] comes the secret rapture of the
[1:31:39] supernatural bride
[1:31:41] she'll be made from more mortal to
[1:31:43] immortality be changed in a moment in a
[1:31:46] twinkling of an eye she's saying we're
[1:31:48] at the top right we're at the top it's
[1:31:51] like when Paul sees who have come to
[1:31:53] Mount Zion we know that the base what
[1:31:55] Matt sign represents the Bride of Christ
[1:31:57] the base was where the first church age
[1:32:00] came right and God's been building
[1:32:02] building building we're not at the
[1:32:03] bottom or at the top of Mount Zion we're
[1:32:05] at the peak right the climax with the
[1:32:07] time where the bride has changed
[1:32:09] raptured right went over did in Christ
[1:32:12] rise when she comes to her position
[1:32:14] that's why we're going to come to our
[1:32:15] position I mean they're waiting on us
[1:32:17] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:32:20] or complete I mean that's why the life
[1:32:22] of God manifested and you bring them out
[1:32:24] of the grave hallelujah so he says now
[1:32:27] when you hear the sound of a going we
[1:32:29] still have it there and the tops of the
[1:32:31] mulberry trees so at the top of the tree
[1:32:34] where the fruit is being grown again
[1:32:36] when you hear the sound of it going
[1:32:38] hallelujah
[1:32:39] we're living in that time I mean we're
[1:32:43] living in that time and we are living in
[1:32:45] the time now where it's going to be a
[1:32:47] secret it is a secret growing of the
[1:32:50] church hallelujah so now here we are
[1:32:55] this is when we've got to rise up and
[1:32:57] and and defeat our enemy I mean because
[1:33:00] we hear the sound of it going we see the
[1:33:02] fruit on the top of the tree we are
[1:33:03] their fruit right rise up now that's the
[1:33:07] time
[1:33:10] now many people get concerned maybe you
[1:33:13] don't but some people get concerned
[1:33:15] while the devil's going to close up
[1:33:16] churches and any church that's not a
[1:33:18] denomination is going to be closed up
[1:33:19] and you know because you can't by
[1:33:22] yourself now to me that's that's after
[1:33:25] the brides gone because the Lord is here
[1:33:28] and he is stopping the devil have full
[1:33:31] control right but when the bride leaves
[1:33:33] the Holy Ghost leaves the Gentile world
[1:33:35] I mean that's when the devil s full
[1:33:38] control in the Gentile world right so
[1:33:40] now we brother Graham says this in
[1:33:42] Christ the mystery God revealed is his
[1:33:44] but he was identified by God so I was
[1:33:47] saying it he stood alone speaking of
[1:33:48] Christ his church stands alone she's not
[1:33:51] hooked up with nothing but he was
[1:33:53] identified by God being the body that
[1:33:56] God dwelled in in the church is
[1:33:57] identified by his body doing the same
[1:34:00] thing she is his body the manifested
[1:34:02] truth of his promised word for the last
[1:34:04] days she and she alone stands by it
[1:34:07] that's why the devil's howling these
[1:34:09] great organizations set up something to
[1:34:10] close her up
[1:34:11] they'll never do it I mean she'll be
[1:34:14] taken up not closed up she has now risen
[1:34:16] by the power of the vindicated would
[1:34:18] promise to her amen how the bride holds
[1:34:21] that promise he told me he'd return
[1:34:24] after me and I believe it yes sir you
[1:34:26] see to meet her headship her redeemer
[1:34:27] her husband her king her Lord her lover
[1:34:30] her Savior in the provided meeting place
[1:34:33] hallelujah he's got a place to meet them
[1:34:35] you know the bridegroom don't leave out
[1:34:37] nothing he's got the ring the
[1:34:39] identification who's got the ring
[1:34:41] hallelujah he's got the robe that she
[1:34:44] wears her clothing his righteousness
[1:34:47] hallelujah who's who's wearing the red
[1:34:49] wedding garment of his righteousness
[1:34:53] amen he's got the provided place to meet
[1:34:56] of us in the year everything's being
[1:34:58] provided
[1:34:58] he's got the wedding supper already sick
[1:35:00] guests already invited already chosen
[1:35:02] all the angels are standing around his
[1:35:04] servants and attention he says oh so she
[1:35:07] won't be closed up she'll be taken up
[1:35:10] hallelujah that's why we don't need to
[1:35:13] worry about it now we'll just skip
[1:35:16] through this last bit quick Sam's
[1:35:18] hundred forty nine one two three
[1:35:23] Oh we'll go he's praising the Lord sing
[1:35:27] unto the Lord a new song and praise and
[1:35:30] his praise in the congregation of Saints
[1:35:32] letters are rejoice that made him there
[1:35:35] the children of Israel be joyful in
[1:35:36] their king let them praise His name in
[1:35:38] the dance
[1:35:39] let them sing praises unto him with
[1:35:41] timbrel and harp hallelujah for the Lord
[1:35:46] has taken pleasure and his people he
[1:35:49] will beautify the meek with salvation
[1:35:50] they've the Saints be joyful and glory
[1:35:53] let them sing a ladder upon their beds
[1:35:56] that the high praise of God be in their
[1:35:58] mouth and the two-edged sword in their
[1:36:00] hand
[1:36:01] Alleluia this is how we should be now
[1:36:03] the Word of God is powerful show as
[1:36:06] quick and powerful sharper than any
[1:36:07] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:36:09] dividing asunder soul and spirit joints
[1:36:11] and marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:36:13] thoughts and deeds of the heart so we
[1:36:15] have a two-inch instilled in our hand
[1:36:16] write the Word of God this is this is
[1:36:19] this is what this is what we fight with
[1:36:20] right the Word of God amen
[1:36:23] and that word is nigh us faces we have
[1:36:26] that weapon right it's nice even in my
[1:36:29] even in our mouth and in our heart so
[1:36:31] I'm just carrying it physically around
[1:36:33] here but the word is in here write the
[1:36:36] words and here will come forth here
[1:36:37] right and that's how you use this weapon
[1:36:40] as you've got to speak it you've got to
[1:36:41] speak to your enemy you take the promise
[1:36:43] of God amen and speak it forth and faith
[1:36:46] hallelujah that's why this is a time of
[1:36:49] no more silence
[1:36:50] I guess my time when the bride is
[1:36:52] speaking hallelujah now the people and
[1:36:57] and I'll just finish with this there's a
[1:37:01] veil you got to see the effect of
[1:37:03] carrying the word right the Levites the
[1:37:07] Levites were instructed to carry the
[1:37:09] word when Israel went into the Promised
[1:37:12] Land and they carried the ark into the
[1:37:14] Jordan and it opened the Jordan that the
[1:37:17] people could cross her into their
[1:37:19] inheritance right so it actually cradled
[1:37:21] away where people could cross her death
[1:37:23] because Jordan represents death people
[1:37:25] died themselves they crossed Jordan
[1:37:27] there's actually it's by the Word of God
[1:37:28] in Christ an entrance where people can
[1:37:30] go to the new land become one with
[1:37:32] Christ Jesus right so this is the word
[1:37:35] you carry
[1:37:36] this is your weapon this is what it does
[1:37:38] it's not just the ministry we are not a
[1:37:40] Catholic group where it's all the
[1:37:42] priests and it's not the people that's
[1:37:43] what is in all of us why we're called to
[1:37:46] use our weapon right not just a few of
[1:37:48] us that use it all of us are called to
[1:37:49] use it wholly all of us II I called to
[1:37:52] hold the word then death then awaking
[1:37:55] come open an atmosphere can be created
[1:37:57] God can come down and meet people
[1:38:00] hallelujah
[1:38:01] so the priests they took that Ark and
[1:38:06] they crossed Jordan and he says if you
[1:38:13] put brother Graham says if you put God
[1:38:14] first the AH Queen first if you put the
[1:38:18] word first amen you're bound to come out
[1:38:20] right hallelujah you're bound to come
[1:38:23] out right now
[1:38:26] they also so this isn't trying to guide
[1:38:29] a service without a being as will he
[1:38:32] says watch the Ark and the Bible always
[1:38:34] is the type of the word to us because it
[1:38:36] was the Word of God in the Ark now
[1:38:37] notice the Ark what they brought up look
[1:38:39] how they did it it was not put in its
[1:38:41] original god-ordained position this is
[1:38:43] David taking it on account right now God
[1:38:46] see it back there in the law how it must
[1:38:48] be done but this Ark must be how it must
[1:38:51] be moved and who it must be moved by but
[1:38:53] David under his anointing my brother
[1:38:55] don't you miss this my sister's you who
[1:38:57] want to be woman preachers so forth
[1:38:59] don't miss this no matter how much your
[1:39:00] anointing is you've got to put you've
[1:39:03] got to get in God's provided position
[1:39:05] David's anointing was alright but I'm
[1:39:07] doing it he got enthused and stepped
[1:39:09] over the boundary line what did he do he
[1:39:11] stepped over the boundary line and said
[1:39:13] of putting the ark in its original
[1:39:14] position he carried it on a new cart and
[1:39:16] not over the hearts of the Levites it
[1:39:19] was supposed to be carried on the
[1:39:20] shoulder of the Levites which is over
[1:39:22] the heart the word is not in the mind
[1:39:24] it's in the heart not on a new cat what
[1:39:27] was it represented something new David
[1:39:30] did there spoke of every denomination
[1:39:32] therefore be God's Word is not to be
[1:39:35] carried by state prep precipitous or
[1:39:37] bishops and so forth or denomination
[1:39:39] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:41] the heart of man and not in some
[1:39:43] ecclesiastical move the Holy Spirit is a
[1:39:46] treasure of God's love and the heart of
[1:39:47] men and woman to obey see was on the
[1:39:50] show
[1:39:50] his ministers his ministers was the
[1:39:52] levites put it over the left shoulder
[1:39:55] and they picked the act like that
[1:39:56] because it was over their heart they had
[1:39:59] the burden of the word on their heart
[1:40:02] he says amen he said well I'm not a
[1:40:04] minister but we're called to carry the
[1:40:05] word right a mother is a minister to her
[1:40:09] children you are the fifth gospel right
[1:40:12] so you're a minister a husband as the
[1:40:14] priest of the home right and so now if
[1:40:18] the word is carried right it will
[1:40:21] produce life so he's finished with these
[1:40:25] two points so you read what the acted
[1:40:28] and the Old Testament is carried by the
[1:40:29] Levites when they cross it opened away
[1:40:35] and I mean whether there's just a shadow
[1:40:37] the reality is far greater it opened a
[1:40:41] way for the people of Israel to cross
[1:40:43] the Red Sea and they came in during the
[1:40:45] harvest season season Joshua so it
[1:40:48] opened a way that the people could go in
[1:40:49] and possess their inheritance rights in
[1:40:52] the wood carried today opens a way for
[1:40:54] all those who are willing to die to
[1:40:56] themselves to cross through and it also
[1:40:59] was carried around Jericho and it was
[1:41:02] carried around Jericho and that caused
[1:41:04] the wolves to fall down flat that Rahab
[1:41:07] could be freed hallelujah so now we
[1:41:11] carry a word right oh this thing will be
[1:41:15] better we carry a word they carried the
[1:41:20] word around Jericho and by them carrying
[1:41:24] the word Rahab his old life was
[1:41:26] destroyed right she was no longer a
[1:41:29] prisoner in that city of a world that
[1:41:31] was going to fall apart she was free she
[1:41:34] was free now to become one with Salman
[1:41:37] to become part of the promise of God by
[1:41:39] people carrying the word that's the same
[1:41:41] thing with us there's you know we we can
[1:41:45] carry the word that will free God's
[1:41:47] children from their past and from their
[1:41:50] complexes and from their pain and from
[1:41:52] their sin hallelujah that people can be
[1:41:55] freed and not be held up in the city
[1:41:57] that everyone else is fearful they can
[1:41:59] walk out and become one with the promise
[1:42:01] of God hallelujah
[1:42:03] that's what our weapon is amen
[1:42:07] no we hear the sound of a going
[1:42:11] hallelujah don't wallow defeat your
[1:42:15] Waller whatever you do don't don't get
[1:42:19] comfortable in the wall or any even if
[1:42:21] you are get up you know we can actually
[1:42:24] allow our thinking to be trained to
[1:42:27] certain the way as we get older and it
[1:42:29] can be many times the wrong way of
[1:42:31] thinking say Lord that that's a wall oh
[1:42:33] you got to get out of that wallow you
[1:42:36] got to retrain yourself and it's hard if

[1:42:42] I'm gonna go to a marathon now it's
[1:42:44] gonna be difficult over ten years ago it
[1:42:49] wouldn't have been difficult because I
[1:42:52] was already already had some fitness
[1:42:55] right but now be a lot harder now than
[1:42:58] it would be back then but if I have the
[1:43:00] ambition right even if I pull a muscle
[1:43:03] or just stepping other putting on my
[1:43:05] shoes I pull a Hemi right it can happen
[1:43:08] I know that's ridiculous
