========================================

i'm glad to see each one of you so the song the song that i'm going to sing relates to also what brother isaac the other the other uh stanza that spoke about the fire on the day of pentecost so if maybe this is the italian i've trans my wife translated not me my wife helped me to translate it just for you to follow what it means um or you know that's the closest translation we could get but i'll sing it in my mother tongue and because i believe god is not limited by language language barrier those are the things of the devil language barrier is the things of the devil that's why we can speak of heavenly tongues here and the spirit of the lord just makes us one language amen there was there was only one language before they went to the to the tower of bible isn't it sorry i'm not preaching um so thank you for that song that stanza that that spoke about uh pentecostal fire because this song when that pentecostal fire you know splashed when it's placed and bested some of the sparks fell there in africa somewhere some of those parks they fell and landed somewhere in africa and that's where some of these songs that i'm seeing now emanated from those missionaries went out there although they had some ulterior motive some of them but some i believe they were guided by god because this kind of songs could not just come from the devil and that's why i'm here today because of those kind of inspirations amen so the song if kira can help me i just told him hardly this morning so if the boy can play it well just bear with him but i believe he can catch the inspiration it says [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Applause]
