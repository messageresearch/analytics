No feel what it is sorry anyway it's got a revelations chapter 3 verse 14 that's a one of the instruments of some reason it does that maybe just mute them all revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the Angel of the Church of Lady ACN's write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works thou art neither hot nor cold a cold nor hot I would that they were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth nevertheless I mean because they'll say I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and now it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that they shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I sell that they'll mayor see as many as I love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even I as I also overcame and sit down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I mean let's just bow his it a word of Prayer

your loving kindness is better than life and father we thank you dear Lord for this opportunity and Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean you may be seated god bless you now I want to I want to go into something I won't I'm not going to pick it up on sunday cuz there's still a few things on insults Song of Solomon chapter 2 that I want to speak on but I was really pondering this past past couple of weeks that you know this there's so much that has happened in this day now that we that you know that we live in and really if you look at all the all the church ages from from from the first church age all the way down to this church age if you look at all the scripture that's been fulfilled most of us been fulfilled in this in this generation that we're alive in and I wanted to maybe maybe just just go into these things and maybe a little bit of detail that we could really you know really maybe not only just appreciate what we have but also mainly more emphasized what is going on and what we have what the enemy is doing but not only what he's doing but what God is doing yeah because we live in an incredible time where you know we see so much scripture you know being fulfilled you know if we just go to this is going to be a bit of an overview service but I just want to just just just go through a list of things like if we go for example 22 revelations chapter 13 and and we go down to verse 11 now it says here so we won't read it a save time but we'll go on to it later but the first part of Revelation is 13 it speaks of it speaks of the Beast that was wounded that was healed at all the world worshipped it and that power of course as the it's a political power but it's the Roman Catholic Church but then it has the next part and I just wanted to write because this is interesting because it says I beheld another beast coming out of the earth emember remember what we're reading here is symbolic and so in the in the book of Revelation that says that water's our peoples nations multitudes of yo of people so earth as a place where it's not really that inhabited and so there's another beast coming out of the earth so this piece of speaking of is a is actually a nation because it's a political animal okay and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now we have this so so this nation that's come out of a place it's not very densely populated this beast is coming out the earth this is actually the United States of America and and he had to logg two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon so these two horns are the it's it's the horn speakers of a palace of two horns its its its civil and ecclesiastical power so civil government power and ecclesiastical which is religious power so so it had two horns like a lamb so it was like a lamb but it wasn't a lamb and they found it they found it America on the freedom of religion that's why the Pilgrim Fathers they left the old workers are being persecuted the other Puritans so they moved to the new world to escape the persecution that was in the old world so a lamb it speaks of religion of speaks of freedom of religion they meant so it was so it was a nation founded and and and the purpose of that founding was a freedom of religion where the denominations of the old world that control the true worship of God and that's how America was really founded so it had two horns like a lamb and now brother brahim says that this being like lamb it's actually that's actually and I don't have the quote just saw me but he says it he says it's their Buffalo you know you know the Buffalo that they're you know that roams the prairies espeak you that is watched actually this animals it's a buffalo and and he spake as dragon so to speak as someone it's like a further convinces you have you said something and then I repeated basically what you said i'll be speaking as brother cabin because I'm just repeating what he's saying and so initially America never never ever would would would unite with Rome even you see like great presidents like I think I think it was eisenhower and if you're there other early ones they would not bow down and they would not you know have a meeting with the Pope and kisses ring and you'd all these things but you see that wasn't that long ago but then when Pope John Paul passes away there's a picture and there's there's there's the two george bush senior and junior and there was another president and there was Bill Clinton all former presidents and their kneeling down and you know in front of in front of his body praying that the Pope's funeral so there's been a massive massive shift from where one time the president would never ever go and do such a thing there's all these former presidents they're basically paying homage to this man who's dead and the very very nation that they are actually the head of was founded by fleeing that power and so so comes a time because remember we read scriptures like this and sometimes we just think it's like a narrative this happens in this happens and this happens but this the scripture actually it doesn't you know there's a there's a gulf of time and i'll show you in the scripture how this is so there's a gulf of time between it had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon that's why there's a comma there is actually a golf and time between these two things and so now America now is speaking as the same as the as the Vatican speaks it's saying the same things because they're they've become allies but there was a time where they weren't allies now I'm going to show you in the scripture just quickly or yeah it's like you see this principle if we go to Luke chapter 4 if we're going to Luke chapter 4 and we're going to read the scripture here with Jesus in the synagogue and he gets handed the book so if you go to Luke chapter 4 verse 16 and then we're going to read then we're going to read where where there's actually quoted from Sony came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day stood up for to read and there was delivered under the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so so Jesus searched out this and he and he's quoting it now the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all then there in the synagogue were fasted on him and he began to say unto them this day the scriptures fulfilled in your ears okay but now if we go back to eyes go back to the Book of Isaiah and I believe that it's chapter 61 so this is this is the we're going to read what Jesus quoted okay so as I 61 and verse 1 so this is what he found to read the sprue the Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison's of them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord now that's as far as he read but that's not the whole verse and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that morn so you see Jesus when he read he didn't make a mistake because the word never makes a mistake he was the Word made flesh he never made a mistake so when he found that in the book of Isaiah he deliberately stopped reading halfway through verse 2 he deliberately did it so what he was doing as he is actually showing that that first part of verse 2 he was fulfilling that in the days of his flesh but then that second part was to be fulfilled at a second coming because the day of vengeance of our God that speaks of the day of the Lord the Great Tribulation terrible that's going to be that wasn't when he came the first time that would happen when he comes the second time CC he deliberately split you know split the scripture but if we just read that without understanding that we would think that that is all connected together at the same time you following me so but but we can see here there's at least the others 2,000 year gap between the first part of verse 2 in the second part of verse 2 so so so there's a gulf of time it's all the same word but there's a gulf of time between it being fulfilled and it's the same way we read there in Revelations 13 is it was a gulf of time not quite two thousand years about 200 odd years where where it's at weren't too had two horns like a lamb but then it's fake as the dragon yo now do you want to see it in one more place let's go to Luke chapter one even even even the scripture where it has commas it has you know punctuation all those things those things are put there for a reason it's not just for good English it's there for a reason okay so Luke chapter one and we'll just start reading from verse 13 so this is this is the angel of the Lord speaking to Zacharias which is the father of John the Baptist but the angel said unto them fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord now that's it now we just read there in verse 17 he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father's to the children okay now if we go to melt go keep your finger there and we're going to go to Malachi 4 now I know this is a very familiar scripture to us all so we'll go to verse 5 of Malachi form is going to show you how this this is speaking of two comings of Elijah the scripture split as well behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and she he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the earth with a curse now we read there in Luke chapter 1 verse 17 he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children but there's no talk the angel never says that John the Baptist was going to turn the hearts of the children to the father's yep because that is speaking of a another Elijah ministry so God Himself an angel now a true angel never a true messenger a true angel does not miss quite the word yep so we have here that the angel speaking to Zechariah he actually split Malachi for there shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and that was exactly what he is doing because he wasn't turning them back to the faith of the fathers which was Moses he was turning them from that faith of what they had made of that faith to receive Christ yeah so so there was there was two thousand years between the first part of Malachi to the second part of Malachi amen but we we would just read it we just think it's all one event but there was two different ministries and then we can further Caesar see this if we're if we're going down this way we'll go to we'll go to Matthew chapter 11 and they will go to be civil and as they departed Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment the whole day that we're soft clothing are in Kings houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yeah son to you more than a prophet for this is he of whom has written behold I say my messenger before thy face and he shall prepare thy way before me bill I said to you among them that are born of the woman of women there's has not risen a greater than John the Baptist not with standing he that is least in the kingdom is greater than he that was keep reading and for the days of John the baptism until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied under John for if you will receive it this is elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear so Jesus himself was saying he came in the spirit of Elijah and in that even even that that verse verse 10 behold hace mi mission before thy face he shall prepare the way before thee that was Malachi 3 and verse 1 but I just rent continue reading down because Jesus himself is saying that John came that was this is elias which was for to come and then now we'll go to Matthew chapter 17 and will read will read verse 10 he says now is everyone there yep and his disciples asked them saying why didn't say the scribes that the last must first come and jesus answered said unto them Elias truly shall come first and restore all things but i say to you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but I've done unto Him whatever they listed likewise shall also the sudden man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist so look he says he says a lie so verse 11 a loss truly shall come restore all things so he's going to come he shall come as it in the future he shall come and restore all things but i say to you that license come already and then you have not so they saying he had already come and that was John the Baptist but then here speaking of a future profit that would have the spirit of Elijah that would restore all things so he's talking about the took there's the two comings of Elijah he shall come and he's come he speaking of two different ministries yeah and that and that is all from you see how God can take a scripture he can split it in two and they can be for totally two different Cummings and even the book of Revelation sometimes we read it and we think this happens this happens this happens this happens but it's not all in order that way there's gulfs of time between even it as I showed you that one scripture there's two hundred-odd years between the first part of Scripture in the second part that's why it took a prophet to come and show us truly what is in the word because otherwise we would be you know stumbling around trying to work these things out for ourselves so now let's age that we have you know the short spin when when the lady accenture change that's why i read that read that there in Revelations three the short span of wind of when the Spirit of God was poured out in azusa street 1906 the gifts of the Spirit were restored and then now we're down a hundred and hundred and whatever years I can't do math right in 110 years from then to Nell and as they oh yeah you gotta got a nod that's that I can I can I can I can work that up a short space of 110 years there's been so much of the scripture being fulfilled if you look at it and these things had not happened in the first six Church changes you know we can see we can see in this age Satan has been enthroned as god of this world Jesus Christ has been thrown out of his church Jesus Christ the Son of man has been fully revealed like never before amen so and and the Catholic Church has pretty much consumed the whole earth I meant as an as an in control we're on the verge of a one world government which never would have happened there's been two hundred thousand thousand demons released a mint upon the earth as railsback as a nation the bride is taking her position Satan's churches taking her position I mean there's a lot of things that have happened these last hundred years that have never happened before and it's very important that we would look into them to understand where we are in the world because even just oh and they're very sorry i forgot to mention the very reason that we even went to Revelation 13 saying by the man saying it was a buffalo is because very recently in the last month the official animal of america is the buffalo amen you say well that's just clutching at straws no it's not brother Bram said it would be that way and then finally the Buffalo is now the official official animal of America I thought that I thought that's interesting we also have you know we have we have Protestantism and cat you know Catholicism dev United back together the World Council of Churches was not here a hundred years ago and now pretty much unless you you know we are very much in the minority Amen virtually every do not work no we're not denomination but if you look at Christianity as a whole all of its pretty much been swallowed up into that thing amen and so there's so many things that have happened and it's not just to mentally well you know mentally say well yes I understand how the Bible goes together but if you can really recognize where we are and not only you know and not only where we are what the enemy's doing I think you look at you yourself and you look at the world and you could in a totally different way if you could really grasp you know we had another thing you have this this age we've had we've had a prophetic ministry like never before has come upon the earth the man ages come to an end I'm just throwing these things out because I'm going to go to the greater detail as the lordly suppose one of you know there's been a change of dispensation endless H like never before amen it's like it's like when Jesus came jon was here rather the law was actually the blood of bulls and goats and the you know and the and the and the priesthood and the temple and all these things that have become ingrained into the Jewish Society those are things have been done away and they came a day you know like I'm yo hood I heard by the Isaacs sermon i watch that he had a had a picture of a missile coming out of the ground he sees it'll be a day like any other day and some you know and all these things will be released you know it wasn't they like in the other day when Jesus died the day like any other day when he was there was a day like any other day when when when when he the son of god Karen Elson up Calvary it was a day like many other days they had many executions they have many crucifixions but that day was very different kind of day because that they know the way into the Holy of Holies was going to be declared I'm in the you know I heard brother Bram saying availing of God the the real mercy seat was hanging in plain view on Calvary here is the mercy seat and then the day before that you could take a lamb to the priest and you'd be justified the day after that you take a lamb to the priesthood do you no good it was a big change had just happened but other day like any other day amen and so and then and then so they continue doing what they are doing but God had had had turned a corner and change what he was doing and it's the same thing in this day oh oh I'll put it bluntly there was a time when you could go to denomination and you could receive eternal life then they rejected the source of eternal life and you can go to now I'm not talking now when I say this I'm talking about going in a rapture eternal life I'm talking about becoming the bride of Christ eternal life I'm not talking about white throne judgment eternal life because we don't have a Church that we'd go to white throne judgment we we've gathered around this revealed word that would go to rapture that is the reason we've gathered not nothing I am tamiya this is my heart of any one of us go to the white throne judgment I feel like I failed amen because we're not here to go to weather and judgment week here for a body change we've heard this word because we're going to receive a new body I mean there's something in us that is responded to this word because there is a new body for us amen so so I'm not talking about receiving eternal life the way their own judgment I'm talking about going in the rapture so there was a time where people could be in a denomination and they could become one of the Bride of Christ and so therefore they would be in the rapture but there came a time when they rejected Christ and there's no resurrection for a rapture and denomination anymore that may sound pretty pretty strong but it's just like the first coming of Christ the lamb the lamb the blood of lamb cover their sins but then it came the next day the blood didn't do any good because the real blood was shed on Calvary they came a time because but because they rejected him pilot awesome should I release you Barabbas or Jesus and they said give us Barabbas give us this murderer what should I do with this one called the Christ crucify him will not have this man rule over us amen and so there he came to his own and his own received him not yeah so now and it happened again in this day where Jesus is behold I stand at door knock and that is not some people take that text and they say that's Jesus knock you on your heart because he wants to come in and to a degree that is true but that's not the full truth of that scripture it is that he's on the outside of the church world trying to get back in because they rejected him and they and they because they held on to their creeds and dogmas and man's ideas and they rejected the truth and that's why he was rejected just like when he came the first time they held on to their traditions of the fathers the traditions they had and they rejected the Prince of life and they thrust them out and they killed him so he comes a time and it's already come where to go on a rapture to go on a rapture now you won't find that you won't find that at a denomination but you'll find it where Jesus is now let's go to first John 17 I want to probably lay this principle in and then we'll see here we go I've been listening to brother Lonnie's bible study series as well but i don't want to repeat what he said but i want to kill her in the picture a bit more so and so this is now why you could say oh that's so shocking how could you say there's no rapture for those people they're good people absolutely but there's a principle in the scripture that people forget and this is the principal first John and we'll just read from verse 5 no verse 3 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with a son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say then we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth and then that do not the truth and my imagine that means practice not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus I says son cleanses us from all sin if we say we have not sinned we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and as word is not in US this is a very important principle because John is saying if we walk in the light remember there's a qualifier but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another which is us and God and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from Al elson so in order to be cleansed from all sin you got to walk in the light amen so if you take the opposite of that if you do not walk in the light as he is in the light you don't have true Fellowship you would God and it doesn't cleanse you from all sin yeah this is very important because every church every Church under heaven they would say do you believe you if we ask them do you believe in Jesus dying on the cross all of Christendom would say absolutely and then you'd go to maybe some more I don't know I don't know about the Catholic being go to the vast majority and say well have you accepted him as personal Savior absolutely they would say do you believe that the blood of Jesus Christ was enough to cleanse you from your son absolutely do you believe he died for you on Calvary I'd say absolutely yeah we would all we would all but it's only pointing to an a historical event a meant by one offering here sanctified he has perfected them forever that are sanctified so it was done and you have to believe he died on the cross for you don't get me wrong you must believe he did a mint but then what enables you to receive what he did for you amen now I hope this comes out alright so for example if an order to receive what he did based on the scripture we must walk in the light amen so two people can say they genuinely believe in Calvary but if one is not walking in the light then they do not receive what happened on Calvary and its fullness yeah because that's the way that's the reason that's the reason that the bride doesn't go on a tribulation because the bride there's no sin in the bride she is cleansed from all sin he dwells in his bride she is part of him yep she is part of him she is sinless so there's nothing here that can hold her when the body change happens yeah because the tribulation the Tribulation Period is a whole purging nature is purged amen Israel is purged the world is purged yeah because it because it's a great because the judgments of God are poured out upon the earth and its fullness there's a judgment being taking place and so the church that goes into that they receive that judgment as well because they're in this earth amen but then if he took our judgment on Calvary then why would why would if he took our judgment there then why would we go to a place to receive judgment and the Great Tribulation the only reason that would be is that the people have it fully received what he did on the Calvary for you and so if that is the case so what happens then is that there's people the reason people go and to the great enter the tribulation is because they're not fully walking in the light amen they haven't totally become one with him that's why that's why people you know that's why it's essential No is that clear this is like a Bible study done that make sense a mint because why would God fully pay for our you know why power sundeck clean annihilate anything held against us and then send us into a judgment time why would he do that doesn't make any sense you know so if he if he paid for our if he took our judgment on Calvary the wrath of God was poured out upon Jesus Christ the man there on Calvary if that was poured out for you upon him he became me he took my place I mean that you know that I could be sinless if that happened then why would he send me into a time when the world is judged amen but the only reason I would a people would end up there yet believing in Jesus is because they're not walking in the light amen now we're going to find out what this light is because it's not some airy-fairy thing it's a very concrete thing in the scripture so we'll go to the book of John and I believe it now we got a chapter five we're going to read this member John with yo we just read it in in two places three places John was sent to prepare the way the Lord the scribes and Pharisees went to him and they said who are you are you the crisis is now I'm not and they said who are you says I'm the one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way which is from Isaiah I think chapter forty he was directly quoting The Book of Isaiah saying this is me yep so John John was fulfilled scripture he was fulfilling his part of the word yep I'll go to verse 33 and John five he sent done to John and he bear witness under the truth but i received not testimony for a man but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but I have a greater witness and that of John for the works which the father have given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father has sent me so Jesus saying that he was a great he was a burning and shining light and you're willing for a season to rejoice in his life what was john i said it yeah yeah i've already given you answer John was a scripture being loved out he was the fulfillment of the scripture so whenever the word has manifested because he was he was Isaiah 40 the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was that word made manifest he was the one to prepare the way the Lord Malachi 3 verse 1 he was that word made manifest he was the first part of Malachi 4 we read to turn the hearts of the father's to the children he was that word made manifest so when the word has made manifest it is light yep so when the word has made manifest it is light and that's why Jesus said he is a burning and shining light and you're willing for a season to rejoice in his light because they are rejoicing because it says in the scriptures as many as received John's baptism they received Jesus amen because they were there rejoicing in and in the light that John gave which was a so if you received now here's a principle whenever God does something that is light yep so when Moses came it was light you could say you could take this same same scripture and you could apply it to Moses he Moses was a burning and shining light yeah he was because he was the deliverer that would come he was that part of the fulfillment of the prophecy God gave Abraham how their seed with sojourn in a strange land 400 years I've inflicted then that be brought out with a mighty hand into the Promised Land there was a prophecy so when Moses went God Commission moses god says in Exodus chapter 3 i've i've heard the cries of my people i am come down and says behold i send you so God promised Abraham I'll deliver them with a mighty hand what what did he use he used a man to deliver his people so he came down he came down I could say n Moses to deliver his people from Egypt and take them to the promised land amen and all the people that rejoiced in his life because he was the Word made manifest they receive salvation from the from the from the afflictions of of Egypt they receive deliverance from the from the whoops and the mud pits and all these things now I've delivered out of that and now we'll take it up into the Promised Land amen so they receive deliverance by receiving that but then but then now what happens is that every generation God does something they meant so God so and and it's up to the people of that generation to believe in what God is doing in that generation amen it's not enough just to believe in a historical god yo but you must believe those six but it's not just enough to believe a historical God you have to believe what he's doing in your day amen and because because if every generation they had that challenge you know because the challenge in Moses's day wasn't wasn't just believing that they were going to be taken out of Egypt too I mean you're taking out of Egypt into the Promised Land speaking of Israel when those slaves the challenge was is this the man to do it is this the one that's been commissioned and as I say you know and there was always when when challenges rose up like Quora Nathan and the wilderness the challenge was not against we're going into the land the challenge was it gets Moses amen the challenge was against Moses and then and then so all the trials came because it even says and I don't have the scripture off the top of my head but God even says to Moses he says he says I'm going to get the people to that the people would believe you I meant because the people had to believe Moses because they didn't believe Moses they weren't going to sit down and listen to what he said and they were going to act upon it yes so the challenge so the children that day was not just to believe yes God wrote to our told our father Abraham we're going to leave this place one day the challenge was was Moses the man to do the job was Moses the ones fulfilling that scripture to take us out and then now you come to John the Baptist you know the scribes and Pharisees believe the Book of Isaiah but then when it was fulfilled I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness could they believe that amen because just having a historical God is no good you must have a present they got ya and then when Jesus came they believed Isaiah 9 a virgin shall conceive they all believe that but then when it happened it's a very different thing amen and then now when the when the when the Apostles are in the yarn 120 there in the upper room the Spirit of God fills them like the promise was and then Peter says the is that spoken by the Prophet Joel I'll pull my spirit out upon all flesh he's saying this scripture has been he could say this day this scripture has been fulfilled because because they were the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy for that day and then so the challenge was could they believe and receive now what had happened yeah so they had to receive the people had to receive that and then and then you even come if we go to if we go to Acts chapter 18 we have a group of people here that only have the baptism of John but by the time Paul comes and speaks to them John has come and gone Jesus is come and God the Holy Ghost is poured out and these people actually living in the past they don't know that God has moved on now we're going to read from verse actually the end of X 18 or even verse 24 and a certain Jew named the Paullus now we're going to see these people are Christian people I'll show you bought at Alexandria an eloquent man in a mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit e spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into acacia the Brethren rotek sorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ so here was someone who believed in Jesus yep but then if we got x 91 and it came to pass that while a pulse was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coast of Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether it be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said under John's baptism then Paul then said Paul John veli baptized with the baptism of repentance saying under the people that they should believe on him what should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12 so here was a group now you got to walk in the light as he is in the light there's principles all the way down through the scripture so here was a group of people they had received John's baptism they were preaching that Jesus was the Christ but they had missed the coming of the Holy Ghost they had missed a very purpose of Jesus ministry was that God might dwell in people once again and so now they had a choice they could have either rejected what Paul was saying saying this is some new fandangled thing I'll have nothing to do with it this is what we believe and they would have stayed in darkness because God had moved on or they could receive what God had done and got rebe apt eyes correctly and received the Holy Ghost and we read the end of the story they-they-they believes what Paul told them and they walked in the light as he is in the light amen and they received the Holy Ghost because if you truly if you're truly sealed into the kingdom that means that means now if you've been sealed into the kingdom God has has totally wiped out your past present and future send it amen if you're a finish work then there can be nothing in your future that can be held against you I mean because God doesn't seal you into the kingdom just to unseal you if you do something wrong that's not how it works he seals you in and you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption Amen see your finished work and you just basically grow going and maturing in the Lord until these atoms are changed hallelujah amen of course you're still here yeah I think I've gone over before there's a difference between capital s I NS kept unbelief and then little sis sins which are like you know as it's in a first shot if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us so the things we probably do wrong every day but if we confess them to him than his faithful and just to forgive us amen so then so if we're sealed into the kingdom then God has already wiped he doesn't attribute our past present or future since or unbelief that we had against us amen brother Graham says now we went God sees a believer he doesn't see the believer he sees the blood of the Lamb he just sees it he just hears a voice coming through the blood Oh were you so he doesn't see you he sees he sees the blood and he just hears your voice go through the blood Amy I'm glad that that's true amen so they had the challenge now would they walk in the light as he is on the light because even now if we go back to X chapter 9 and then we'll quickly go we'll go to the book of Revelation which got to accept and I'm very quickly and we'll go to verse 15 but this is after so X 9 is when when Paul meets Paul meets the Lord on the road to Damascus and he gets converted and then now this is the Lord speaking to entice who was meant to go and pray for Paul that he had receivers site and baptize them and so forth I believe it's and he says here actually no just pray from it that he would receive a site and in the Lord towels towels Ananias because it in i sighs but Lord is persecuted many in Jerusalem he's an enemy of your people but then the Lord tells them but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to be a my name before the Gentiles and kings and the show of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake so Paul was now a chosen vessel to take his name the name of the Lord before the Gentiles kings and children of Israel and then Paul writes in the book of I come every was first a second Corinthians this is them that a spiritual among you let them acknowledge that the things are right unto you they are the commandments of the Lord amen so then Paul Paul this is in a few places he he received a dispensation of the gospel a dispensation of the gospel is committed to him so word for an age seven Church ages was committed to Paul amen because all the all the true believers depending upon how it's light now given through the ages at all tied back to what Paul said this was his in Galatians 1 if an angel if we or an angel teach you any other gospel that which you ever received let him be accursed and even repeats it again so what Paul said was the foundation and every true messenger depending on the light that they received well it will dovetail with what Paul said amen so that's why pulsing and in bed Corinthians the things that I write unto you there were two spiritual link them acknowledge they are the commandments of the Lord so there's a challenge now here comes a man and he's actually saying these letters are right to you they are the commandments of God if your spiritual you'll catch it that's what he's saying basically he's saying if your spiritual you'll acknowledge this is actually God riding this is not my idea this is God yeah so the people had a choice now they could say ah but we just believe in Jesus and that's a yo I don't need a messenger I don't need a prophet I just all I need to do is believe in Jesus that sounds very good but jesus said if you receive if you receive them I send I mean if you receive them I've sent you've received me and if you've done that you've received him that sent me amen and I'll find the scripture but it's there Jesus says that and so if you take the opposite of that if you reject them that Jesus sends you reject Jesus amen that's yeah it's that simple and so if that's the case then if you receive who me since then therefore you receive him and you receive him that sent them yep so if you receive who Jesus sends then then you're walking in the light yep are you following me so far yeah this is very important because you must understand we are a church but we're not like other churches it's not trying to be exclusive this is this is a scriptural principle and it's been all the way down through it's been from it's been from Adam it's been as you say first profit there was no or God spoke to they meant if you receive Noah you ought to God in the boat if you reject no there's no way you're getting in the boat there's no way you'd get in the arc why would you you'd say you're crazy old man the world's going to get better it's fine don't worry you know and so it's a scriptural principle if you receive him that God sends you receive you receive Jesus Christ amen that's why people can't just say well all I need to do is believe in Jesus it sounds good but if you're a chick the one that Jesus sends how can you say well how can you say you're following Jesus a mint because God doesn't frustrate his own plans amen so let's just go to revelations and we'll go to revelations chapter one and we'll just read the last two verses now this is all in the church age book but I just wanted to lay it out because it's important that we understand these principles of the scripture right the things which thou has seen and the things that are and the things that shall be Hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which are source of my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks with our source are the seven churches so now we're about to I'll just close with this now the seven churches we know what they are because revelation is two and three John is commanded to write to seven churches but these books are prophetic so they're not just speaking to a local church because I've read a book on the Book of Revelations once I pass through it at your from the Christian group at campus there in Canterbury University he gave me this book about the book of Revelation and basically what this book said was this basically was all fulfilled the seven these seven churches that that Jesus is writing to through John they were literal churches and there were only two them it's not prophetic or anything that's interesting win it because when this commentary book came to revelations chapter 10 it didn't say a whole lot I didn't know what the seventh angel was in the mystery of God should be finished it just it just totally skipped because it was a verse by verse commentary and just totally jumped over that verse so now so these so but these were literal seven churches there in Asia Minor which is Turkey but it wasn't just writing to them or speaking of 7th periods of time from from from when Paul founded the church Ephesus all the way down to the rapture that's a prophetic time and so if there are seven churches and we read the interpretation the seven stars are the seven angels of the seven churches so these angels now they are not heavenly beings here because an angel in the Bible it does mean a heavenly being like Gabriel or you know one of the angels will also means and they would angel means a messenger so while we're while we're here let's go to Gleason's chapter 4 I just want to show you a scripture here glaciers chapter four and 14 because Paul rain through the glaciers season Galatians 4 and 14 I just having a bit of a Bible study so so so i want you to see these things in the scripture and my temptation was not in my flesh I mean so an temptation which was in my flesh you despise not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus so Paul himself is saying to the Galatians you receive me as an angel of God even as Christ himself yep and Paul was the angel to the first church each so they received them correctly they didn't worship him but they received them as an angel of God even Christ Jesus because they they they could see what Paul's ministry was Jesus Christ revealing himself through the foot first you change messenger so now at their seven of their seven churches and there's a start to each H now if the people wanted to walk in the light as he is in the light they had to receive the message of that star but we understand that only it's really only in this end time that we know who these messengers are but it's when but it's not you must understand it's not receiving the vessel it's receiving the Ministry of the vessel such receiving the word that came out of the vessel because that word that is spoken as light yeah so if you receive because remember a star it's like the moon you know you know in the scripture it speaks about the Sun and the moon and the stars and it's just all symbolic the Sun is Christ the moon has no light of itself it just reflects the light of the Sun onto the earth and we have no light in ourselves but we're just reflecting the light of the true son Jesus Christ amen and stars stars you see like we see Jupiter or Mars or we see I think I'm there's um now is another season where one of I think mercury or or Venus I'm not sure which one is actually you can see it going going between it's going between the Sun and the earth and you and you can actually see it move across the Sun we're in it we're in the season every so often they could do that that's why captain cook went to Tahiti one of his expeditions was to actually track I can't move which planet it was but to track that planet go across the Sun it's true it's this way I don't know why that we need to do it buddy but they went there but you see a star like the earth is a start it reflects light or Mars or yo we can see the planets this does they have no light of themselves they're just reflecting the light of the true son yep so a star all it does is reflects the light of the Sun to the earth it's heralding a message like the day style you know whichever one its heralding its heralding the dawn yeah and maybe we're going to that later sometime too but so these seven stars are the seven messages to the church and so to walk in the light you had to receive that stars ministry yep so the people in Paul's age they couldn't just say well I'm just going to follow Jesus I believed he died and rose for me and you know that his blood cleanses they had to believe that but they had to receive what that what that ministry was saying yeah and then you come down all the way through and then brother I'm gives a principal in the judges book he says he says the ministry that affects the age most that is the messenger to the age so Paul we can agree because even when John wrote the book of Revelation or he received those visions over two year period however long it was Paul was already dead he has already been beheaded but his ministry affected that first church age greater than all the other apostles because he was the start of the age and then you can even come down to the dark ages with a worthy with a messenger to the dark angels being I believe it was calamba he actually died before the thigh Tyrone age i believe it was before that actually even started he died just before it started he said well how was he the message ative into that age he found today hey hey he founded a Bible School up on the west coast of Scotland on an island and this and and the person who said this is not a believer but a but a Bible scholar and he said that that that bible school that was founded by Columba for the next nine hundred years all of the evangelical work for Europe came from that Bible School because because that was the Dark Ages when the Catholic Church basically smothered out all the truth but it was from that Bible School for the next nine hundred years amen so the teachings of that one man affected the church for the next nine hundred years because of what he did so to me that is the best and that's why that's to me a further vindication of our brother branham because pem being a prophet he could place the messengers he placed because that ministry was to make all the mysteries of God knowing sews all these loose ends that things that people would look at and they didn't fully understand like you take the church ages you can take Larkins book and brother Branham quotes from it he knew what the seven Church ages were but you know what the messengers were he didn't know who they were so people had partial truth down through but then finally took a profit at the end to tie all the loose ends together amen and so so I took a prophet to identify the men to go to identify the stars to the ages and to me that's a further vindication then he picked the right messenger to the Dark Age it's because history proves that ministry affected the age for the most amen and so now those people in the dark age if they wanted to walk in the light they would come under the effects of their bible school because the because the message of the h founded the bible school and if and if that bibles will continue to faithfully teach what they received and if the people would have received the preaching from that bible school because they went through all of Europe yep they would have been walking in the light amen yep and then Luther came along the just shall live by faith you know and the people that receive that message then they begin to walk in the light yep but it was now another age and down on through things have been out the words been opening up through various things and so that that's what's the principle if you receive whom I send you receive me Jesus saying so if you receive who i sent you receive me so if you do that then you're walking in the light see it's not you know when I talk about walking the light I'm not talking about fully understanding and comprehending everything but if you walk on the line as here's and the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse you from all sin a mint and God and God will keep walking with you that you do and then also G this isn't first John but the Spirit of Truth who you have received that may be so I might begin mixed up but says it says in there yes first John chapter two verse 27 no actually that's not the scripture I'm looking for I believe this in John chapter 14 and maybe after this if we could have some musicians to come I don't want to keep you too long tonight 1320 yes believe us and to you he that receiveth whom server eyes send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me yep so that that's very important I just leave it but he says I yes John 16 and verse 13 he says howbeit when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so when the spirit of truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth that means that spirit of truth is the Holy Ghost yep so if you really know the Lord Jesus because remember Jesus and the Holy Ghost are the same it's not there's not two different things did the same one so if you truly know him he will lead you and guide you into all truth yep so it's not us trying to grasp well am I walk in the light now because the wood has expanded and grown all these things if you walk in the light as he is in the light I'm just going to join these two together and operates pleasing to the Lord if you walk on the lightest tears of the light then you have fellowship who you and God and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin and then if the spirit of truth is come he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen so if you walk if you walk where he is I'm just going to paraphrase those two scriptures if you walk where he is then he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and his blood cleanses you from all sin amen and that's very important because there's so many beliefs around so many ideas but yet God has said now if you walk in my light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin so he'll vindicate whereas lighters and to prove this as me and then all we have to do is walk in it receive it and walk in it if we want our all of our sins to be you know then and then if that is the case then the blood cleanse us from all sin I meant but if we reject what he's doing an hour day then the blood cannot cleanse us from all sin yeah based on that principle amen what would we like to sing praise the Lord for the you girls alleluia amen one of them amen listing one of them but um yeah let's stand but I want to so not this sunday i want to wrap up Song of Solomon or maybe next two sundays but I want to go into this this this this last hundred and ten years has been incredible time and a lot of things have happened we are there's so much scripture being fulfilled you know and it's such a glorious thing and I want to just to put in that kind of introduction to really emphasize we need to walk in the light amen alleluia amen less sickness they were gathered they were baptized with more food for you I'm so glad I can't Oh ha Donna people is virus in the same time I up Wow so glad I can't say think that will fit your heart and we'll start the joy of life I can't say yeah Wow what you have another verse really amen let's just close in a word of prayer amen sorry father we were to tell you that we love you lord we're so glad

as we go what's out of the course so glad I can't I can say I'm so glad I did say ha yes I these people they ever be there when the car yes Oh I I can't say it is turning out within my lord is I can't
