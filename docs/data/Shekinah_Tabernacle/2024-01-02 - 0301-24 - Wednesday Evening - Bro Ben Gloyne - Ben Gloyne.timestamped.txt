[3:13] mountain but you know there was there's
[3:14] a scripture that um the Lord said to
[3:17] Moses you know you've you've compassed
[3:19] this mountain long enough it's time to
[3:21] turn
[3:22] northward you know and and I I just like
[3:25] the feeling behind that because you know
[3:27] it's it's it's time to turn and attain
[3:29] all the prom of God you know to to walk
[3:31] that way and I believe that's we're
[3:33] going to continue on that path this year
[3:35] we're going to we're going to we're
[3:37] going to go northward to the promises of
[3:39] God this time next year we're going to
[3:40] have claimed more of the promises of God
[3:42] for our life we're going to search them

[3:47] Christ for each one of us and we're
[3:48] going to attain them amen we're in for a
[3:51] great year it's going to be a very
[3:53] turbulent year I think there going to be
[3:55] a lot of things happen um in in the
[3:58] world it's going to be very very
[4:00] turbulent like almost like put your seat
[4:03] belts on turbulent you know the when the
[4:05] when you're flying on an airplane and
[4:07] they say that the seat belt light comes
[4:08] on it's going to be a very turbulent
[4:10] year you know I just there's just things
[4:12] happening but you
[4:14] know we can have
[4:18] peace when we keep our minds fixed on
[4:21] Christ you know he says he will keep him
[4:24] in perfect peace whose mind has stayed
[4:26] on thee and that's the victory that we
[4:29] have as a believer you know regardless
[4:31] of all the nonsense that goes on around
[4:33] us we can be in perfect peace when we
[4:35] when we just fix our eyes on Christ and
[4:37] not be anxious or anything like that you
[4:38] know when Jesus was being tossed around
[4:40] on the boat he was just asleep the
[4:42] disciples were anxious concerned very
[4:45] worried about the situation and Jesus
[4:46] was
[4:48] asleep you know and and that that that
[4:51] can be our experience if we just keep
[4:53] our eyes on Christ we can just be
[4:55] relaxed in every storm and every
[4:56] situation we just relax we don't need to
[4:58] be anxious we need he got up he said you
[5:00] have little
[5:01] faith cuz you know when we get anxious
[5:04] some it's sometimes because we haven't F
[5:07] put our mind on Christ and we're looking
[5:08] at the situation and we're just anxious
[5:10] but let's look to Christ this evening
[5:12] let's um stand and um just commit the
[5:14] service to the Lord Heavenly Father
[5:16] we're so grateful that we can look to
[5:18] you Lord and not be

[5:22] Lord but we we know that Lord you are
[5:25] the the the God of Peace Lord you give
[5:28] us a peace that passes all understanding
[5:31] Lord and you give us rest Lord within

[25:43] to talk about Daniel here and you know
[25:45] how really we should have an attitude
[25:48] wherever we are sent we're going to
[25:49] serve God wherever we are yes sir you
[25:51] know and Daniel Daniel had a real um I
[25:53] believe you know as as we'll read later
[25:55] you know he you know he read the book of
[25:57] Jeremiah and he realized that it wasn't
[25:59] very long until the prophecy of Jeremiah
[26:01] of the uh Israelites being in Babylon
[26:03] for 70 years was going to be fulfilled
[26:05] and but you know so so he was a he was a
[26:08] uh reader of the scriptures oh yeah and
[26:10] you know there would have been a time no
[26:12] doubt when he would have he would have
[26:13] been reading I just want to read Psalms
[26:15] 139 here he would have read this Psalm
[26:17] and there's something about the word
[26:19] when it's mixed with faith it becomes
[26:20] yours and you know cuz a lot of people
[26:23] say well this is just a Psalm of David
[26:24] this is David just you know singing this
[26:27] this is song but when the word quickens
[26:29] to your heart it's no longer just
[26:31] David's Psalm it's your Psalm it's no
[26:33] longer his Revelation it's your
[26:35] Revelation so I believe Daniel Daniel
[26:38] would have read this and it would have
[26:39] really Quicken to his heart is a Psalm
[26:41] of David oh Lord thou H has searched me
[26:44] and known me thou knowest my downsitting
[26:46] and my Uprising thou understandest my
[26:49] thought a far off thou Compass compasses
[26:52] my path and my lying down and are
[26:55] acquainted with all my ways for there is
[26:58] not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord
[27:00] thou knowest it all together thou Hast
[27:02] beset me behind and before and laid uh
[27:05] thine hand upon me such knowledge is too
[27:08] wonderful for me it is high I cannot
[27:10] attain unto it wherefore shall I go from
[27:12] thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from
[27:14] thy presence I wonder if this is going
[27:16] through his mind as he's walking out of
[27:18] out of Jerusalem the last time and he
[27:20] was taking the reverse Journey that
[27:22] Abraham took CU actually took where
[27:23] Abraham came from Babylon the Earth of
[27:25] chales came up down down to the promised
[27:27] and they took that reverse path I wonder
[27:29] if this was kind of in his mind when he
[27:31] was being led captivity Lord where can I
[27:34] go from your spirit I'm about to leave
[27:36] the promised land of our you my Promised
[27:39] Land the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[27:41] I'm going to go into a Strange Land but
[27:42] Lord You're got to come with me I'm not
[27:45] leaving you behind as I'm being lead
[27:47] into this place and I think we need this
[27:49] to be very much wherever the Lord leads
[27:51] us in 2024 our hearts should be Lord how
[27:54] can I serve you here amen how can I
[27:57] worship you how can I be a living
[27:58] testimony in this current place and I
[28:01] find myself am me if I Ascend up into
[28:03] heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed
[28:05] and H behold Thou Art there if I take
[28:07] the wings of the morning and dwell in
[28:08] the uttermost parts of the sea even
[28:10] there shall thy hand lead me and thy
[28:13] right hand shall hold me if I say surely
[28:15] Darkness shall cover me even the night
[28:17] shall be light about me ye the darkness
[28:19] hideth not not from thee but the night
[28:23] shineth as the day the darkness and the
[28:25] light are both alike to thee for thou
[28:27] Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast
[28:30] covered me in my mother's womb I will
[28:32] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[28:34] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[28:37] and that my soul knoweth right well my
[28:39] substance was not hid from thee when I
[28:41] was made in secret and curly wrought in
[28:43] the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes
[28:46] did see my substance yet being unperfect
[28:49] and in thy book all my members were
[28:51] written which in continence were
[28:54] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[28:56] them how precious also are thy thoughts
[28:59] unto me oh God how great is the sum of
[29:02] them if I should count them they are
[29:04] more in number than the sand when I
[29:06] awake I am still with thee yeah now we
[29:09] could keep reading but I just want to
[29:10] leave it there you know so so I believe
[29:12] D Daniel would have read this and he
[29:14] would have realized no matter where I go
[29:16] the Lord's with me and I'm going to be a
[29:18] believer wherever I go that's basically
[29:19] what he made up in his mind I'm going to
[29:21] be a I'm going to be a worshipper of God
[29:23] as a slave in the unix's house in the
[29:26] palace in Babylon wherever I'm going to
[29:29] go I'm going to be a believer I'm not
[29:31] going to let it weigh me down I'm not
[29:32] going to let it change who I am I'm not
[29:34] going to let it mold me that I forget
[29:37] who I am I'm going to be a Christian
[29:39] wherever I'm sent and I think this is
[29:41] how we should be cuz we're at we're in a
[29:43] Babylon we're not in modern day Iraq but
[29:46] this world is a Babylon right it's a
[29:48] place of confusion and and trouble and
[29:50] demon powers and the works of darkness
[29:53] and all these things but yet if Daniel
[29:55] could walk into Babylon and be
[29:58] successful under the blood of bulls and
[30:00] goats he had no church he had no
[30:02] favorite preacher to listen to he he
[30:04] didn't have a camp every year to go to
[30:06] he couldn't go visit some other Church
[30:07] some other place he had no other
[30:09] encouragement but he decided see when
[30:11] you take responsibility we talked about
[30:13] the other night when you take
[30:15] responsibility for yourself it's not an
[30:18] it doesn't have to be an external thing
[30:19] saying do this and stop this and start
[30:21] this and go here and do this no when you
[30:23] take responsibility it's in here and
[30:25] it's and it's motivating you So Daniel I
[30:28] believe he he took responsibility I'm
[30:30] going to praise God wherever I am I'm
[30:32] going to praise God Amen I don't know
[30:34] what's going to what's going to happen
[30:35] when we get there Shadrach mesach Ando I
[30:37] don't know but we're going to praise God
[30:39] there you know so I think I think we can
[30:42] we can walk in the same kind of way
[30:44] right cuz Daniel's a shadow there's got
[30:45] to be a reality in the end time amen
[30:48] that everything that Daniel saw we are
[30:50] seeing manifested in this time right I
[30:52] mean a lot of it a lot of it's been
[30:54] fulfilled but you understand what I mean
[30:56] so so if he can walk walk in the blood
[30:58] of bulls and goats and be successful how
[31:01] about you and
[31:02] I see the first thing the first thing
[31:05] not out here remembered is God has a
[31:07] covenant with me God made a covenant
[31:09] with my four bears with Abraham Isaac
[31:11] and Jacob and I'm under that same
[31:13] Covenant it wasn't me making a covenant
[31:15] with Jehovah that counts it's god
[31:17] Jehovah made a covenant with me and we
[31:19] got to realize God has made a covenant
[31:21] with you and I amen and I trust that you
[31:23] react to that Covenant saying yes Lord
[31:25] Lord here I am I'm your child amen let's
[31:28] get everything out of the way and just
[31:29] just I trust God can just establish that
[31:31] in our hearts I'm his son or I'm his
[31:33] daughter I'm maen I've been bought with
[31:36] the price of the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:37] it doesn't matter what I got what I have
[31:39] to go through I'm going through Lord I'm
[31:42] still going to be a Christian see the
[31:43] three three Hebrew children they
[31:45] basically said to the king we're going
[31:47] to be worshiping in the furnace then
[31:49] that was basically what they said to him
[31:51] because we're not going to Bow either
[31:53] God will deliver us or not that's
[31:55] actually not the question in our minds
[31:56] about what God's going to do for us
[31:58] we're going to worship Him Anyway amen I
[32:01] trust that's how you feel tonight you
[32:03] know remember what God has blessed is
[32:05] blessed and he cannot reverse his
[32:07] Blessing and that blessing has nothing
[32:09] to do with the bank balance of size of a
[32:11] house all the material things that we
[32:13] think is a blessing that's not the real
[32:15] blessing the real blessing is the
[32:17] revelation of Jesus Christ to you in
[32:19] your day in your heart that is the you
[32:22] are the most blessed person for God to
[32:23] reveal himself to you and to walk with
[32:25] you you're blessed more than Bill Gates
[32:28] the the guy who owns Amazon Elon Musk
[32:30] all those people you're way more blessed
[32:32] than them you're not even in the same
[32:33] category that's right than them that's
[32:35] right you're blessed totally and what
[32:38] God has blessed has blessed that's what
[32:41] actually God spoke through balam's lips
[32:42] about Israel what God and remember balam
[32:45] was there to try and curse Israel but
[32:47] God spoke through that false prophet
[32:49] saying what God has blessed his blessed
[32:51] and I cannot reverse the blessing I
[32:53] cannot change what God has decreed so I
[32:55] think we've got to take that on board
[32:57] and say Lord if you could look at Israel
[32:59] under the blood of bulls and goats and
[33:00] you say I've blessed those people there
[33:02] was trouble with those people there's
[33:04] all kind of things going on but God
[33:05] blessed them and he could not reverse
[33:07] the blessing how much you and I under
[33:08] the blood of Jesus Christ if you're
[33:10] blessed you're blessed amen you cannot
[33:13] become cursed you're blessed amen and
[33:15] we're worried about falling under some
[33:17] you know the wrath of God is really only
[33:19] reserved for the devil and his
[33:21] angels we're scared about you know we're
[33:23] going to put a foot wrong if we do God
[33:24] will correct us and we'll walk along the
[33:25] path praise the Lord for ction but you
[33:27] know we should not be fear we we we're
[33:30] not ordained to live in fear that he's
[33:31] going to throw us away and brother Bram
[33:33] even said and I remember having actually
[33:35] the same experience before I heard him
[33:36] say it he says if he casts me into hell
[33:38] I'll praise him
[33:40] there and I remember in my early
[33:42] Christian walk you know the devil
[33:43] twisted uh the scripture in my head that
[33:46] basically it's like if you do something
[33:48] wrong and you know it's wrong and you do
[33:50] it then there's no more blood for you
[33:53] and and Lally like a lead balloon like
[33:54] dropped in my heart I thought well I'm
[33:56] I'm toast
[33:57] but I thought well at least but the
[33:59] Bible says that at least one day I'll
[34:01] get to stand before him and I'll be a to
[34:03] tell him I love you anyway and you can
[34:05] cast me to hell if you want I'll worship
[34:06] you there I couldn't go back to the
[34:08] world there's no world to go back to
[34:10] Hallelujah you know that B that bridge
[34:12] was burnt you know and brother Ram said
[34:14] if he had the same Spirit as he had now
[34:17] and God cast him to hell he'd worship
[34:19] him
[34:20] there so let's just get that out of our
[34:23] mind about God's going to cast us away
[34:26] that's right he's called us to keep us
[34:29] right Daniel Daniel had that Revelation
[34:31] I believe I've been called by God I'm
[34:34] going to walk with God I don't know how
[34:36] I'm going to do it but I'm going to do
[34:37] it and God you know because it wasn't
[34:39] just his human grit that kept him on the
[34:43] path because human ability fails there
[34:45] comes a point where H force of will
[34:48] comes to an end so I believe it was more
[34:51] than just his own human ability saying
[34:53] well I'm can I'm going to do this you
[34:55] know that was God God did something in
[34:57] his
[34:58] heart praise the Lord that's exactly
[35:02] Amen brother Bram says here now notice
[35:04] when these Kings before they started out
[35:05] they should have before jehos had ever
[35:07] made an alliance with Ahab uh he thought
[35:10] to have said this first let us pray and
[35:11] see what the will of the Lord is now
[35:13] give me a preacher give me a Christian
[35:15] give me a housewife that's a Christian
[35:17] give me a farmer or a factory worker
[35:19] that will put God first in everything
[35:22] I'll show you a man will be successful
[35:24] in spite of all the devil can put on him
[35:27] he seeks God first he says we must have
[35:30] first we must seek him first so give me
[35:32] a Christian here give me a housewife
[35:35] give me a brother a son a sister a
[35:37] daughter whoever who'll put God first
[35:39] you'll be
[35:40] successful Amen in spite of all the
[35:42] devil can put on you see the devil tried
[35:44] to put a lot of things on Daniel but it
[35:46] wasn't successful over him he overcame
[35:48] it and we got to remember the you know
[35:51] the whole the whole trial of the Lion's
[35:54] Den it wasn't just Daniel got thrown in
[35:57] the den and got out all of his enemies
[35:58] got thrown in the den and they didn't
[36:00] get out am see everything that was
[36:02] causing the trial got eaten up and it
[36:05] was gone thank you Lord amen so a trial
[36:07] isn't just for yeah oh we're going
[36:09] through a trial God wants to deal with
[36:11] some enemies in that trial maybe a bit
[36:13] of humanity and a bit of wrong thinking
[36:15] and things God you know some family
[36:16] spirits and strains God wants to burn
[36:18] away he wants his lies to chew them up
[36:21] and split them out amen that's what he
[36:23] wants to do so trials aren't just for oh
[36:25] we're going through a test here will
[36:26] stand no God wants to get rid of some
[36:28] things yes that's right he doesn't want
[36:30] them bothering you anymore he wants you
[36:31] to walk free of them praise the Lord I'm
[36:35] real happy about that I trust you are
[36:37] too amen thank you Lord hallelujah so
[36:40] and also I believe that Daniel would
[36:42] have would have read here in
[36:44] Joshua especially this be strong and of
[36:47] good courage For unto this people shall
[36:49] thou divide uh for an inheritance the
[36:51] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[36:53] give them only be thou strong and very
[36:55] courageous that thou May observe to do
[36:58] according to all the law which Moses my
[37:00] servant commanded thee turn not from it
[37:02] to the right hand or to the left hand
[37:04] that thou May Prosper wheresoever thou
[37:07] goest maybe he had this in his mind too
[37:09] when he was walking out I just try and
[37:11] make the Bible more real to me you know
[37:14] what was what was he thinking when he
[37:15] was being carried away captive be strong
[37:17] and courageous Shadrach Meshach and
[37:19] abedo let's be strong and courageous the
[37:21] Lord will go with us wherever we go he's
[37:24] not leaving us in Babylon by ourselves
[37:26] we we're not here in this Darkness you
[37:28] know just trying to fend through and
[37:29] just trying to make things through no
[37:31] the Lord's with us he's prepared us for
[37:33] this day you know the Lord's prepared
[37:35] you for 2024 we don't know what we're
[37:37] going to face but the Lord's prepared us
[37:39] for it amen he's already seen what we're
[37:41] going to go through am mean this book of
[37:44] the law shall not depart out of thy
[37:45] mouth but Thou shalt meditate during day
[37:47] and night that thou mayest observe to do
[37:50] according to all that is written therein
[37:51] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[37:53] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[37:55] success have have not I commanded thee
[37:58] be strong and of a good courage Be not
[38:00] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[38:03] Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou
[38:06] goest he's the Difference Maker it's not
[38:09] our Humanity it's not no no it's God
[38:11] that makes the difference so when we go
[38:13] into Babylon when we go out of these
[38:15] doors we go back into Babylon what are
[38:17] we serving Daniel served God Shadrick M
[38:21] go they served God they didn't serve
[38:23] their current state they didn't worship
[38:26] their problem s and what they had to
[38:27] navigate through they worship God as
[38:30] they're walking through Babylon amen and
[38:33] I believe that we can do the same thing
[38:36] we have called to be strong and be of
[38:37] good courage don't be dismayed by what's
[38:39] going on Amen just keep walking on with
[38:41] God amen
[38:44] amen praise the Lord now brother Ram
[38:48] says don't never never try to get to God
[38:50] anything other than to fellowship with
[38:52] God but under the blood that's the only
[38:56] way God knows that the only way God will
[38:58] recognize you must first be Washed by
[39:00] the Water of the word then cleanse
[39:01] through the blood and enter into the
[39:03] shik of Glory go into there into the
[39:04] fellowship then you know where you're
[39:07] standing at it's interesting I was
[39:09] reading before I didn't put it in here
[39:10] maybe I should have but you know how the
[39:12] Jews tried to tried to approach God by
[39:15] their religion by works and not by faith
[39:18] and then the word became a stumbling
[39:20] block to them because they didn't
[39:21] approach the Lord by faith and I fear
[39:24] many message Believers stumble the same
[39:26] way they try and approach God by their
[39:29] good works and what they think they have
[39:30] done instead of by faith right and then
[39:34] when the promises and everything come
[39:35] their way they stumble at the word
[39:37] because they're looking at themselves
[39:38] instead of what God has done for them so
[39:41] we don't want to come that way try and
[39:43] have fellowship with God by what we have
[39:44] done we have nothing to give him nothing
[39:47] to to say look Lord I've done this
[39:49] therefore you got to do this no God's
[39:51] done all things and we're going to
[39:52] receive it by faith yes
[39:55] amen Daniel another one who had purposed
[39:57] in his heart he wouldn't defile himself
[39:59] with the king's meat when he was taken
[40:01] down to Babylon he maintained his
[40:03] fellowship and the presence of lions
[40:05] that was ready to kill him yet Daniel
[40:07] held his fellowship and God sent an
[40:09] angel and stood by him that night and
[40:11] blinded the eyes and shut the mouth of
[40:12] the LI because Daniel had fellowship
[40:15] with the supernatural Daniel had
[40:17] fellowship with the god of Heaven
[40:18] because he was under the blood and
[40:20] that's how he maintained his stand see
[40:23] when you realize you're under the blood
[40:26] that's you're not under a banner of a
[40:27] church or a prophet you're under the
[40:29] blood of Jesus Christ I mean that's how
[40:32] you realize you can maintain your stand
[40:33] because when you realize God has made a
[40:36] covenant with me and if God be me who
[40:38] can be against me amen the Lord is my
[40:41] strength he's my buckler he's my strong
[40:43] tower he's the place I go to and letd
[40:45] off the pressure he's where I go to and
[40:47] a safe he's my defense he's my refuge
[40:49] He's My All In All amen and he made this
[40:52] Covenant with me amen that's how see
[40:54] that's how Daniel maintained his stand
[40:57] the Hebrew children right in the middle
[40:59] of the fiery furnace no matter what you
[41:02] do to them you can't Scorch that
[41:03] Fellowship away from them you can't
[41:06] throw them under enough trials to make
[41:08] them deny it amen a man that's ever been
[41:11] under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[41:13] become filled with the Holy Ghost all
[41:15] the devils in Hell couldn't root it out
[41:17] of him amen he knows where he stands you
[41:19] think I'm crazy swinging my hands but if
[41:22] you felt like I did you'd jump in your
[41:24] seat and do the same thing Hallelujah
[41:26] when really realize we are safe and
[41:28] secure under the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:30] this Satan's Eden can't root it out of
[41:32] us no devil in hell can root it out of
[41:34] us amen why because we're sealed to the
[41:36] day of our Redemption see Daniel when he
[41:39] left Israel he realized I'm a
[41:41] circumcised son of Abraham nothing can
[41:43] change that Glory Hallelujah when you're
[41:46] sealed him by the Holy Ghost nothing can
[41:48] change that the devil can't make you
[41:50] unsealed amen he can't break that seal
[41:52] he can't break that he can't break that
[41:54] Fellowship amen it's he will'll try
[41:56] everything he can but he can't break it
[41:59] amen that's why we can Rejoice cuz
[42:00] nothing can root it out of us that's
[42:02] right what can separate us from the love
[42:04] of God in Christ Jesus our lord as as
[42:06] Paul would say he listed everything
[42:07] under the sun he says
[42:09] nothing Hallelujah so we can that's why
[42:12] we can stand and just rejoice in the
[42:14] trial we can rejoice in Satan's Ed and
[42:16] rejoice in this Babylon because God has
[42:19] ordained that we're going to live
[42:21] victorious in this time amen and then
[42:24] when he would and then Daniel would read
[42:25] in Jeremiah where it said there' be 70
[42:27] years accomplished and you know and then
[42:29] and then and then the children of Israel
[42:31] were coming back amen and they begin to
[42:33] pray and seek God about when these
[42:34] things were going to happen because he
[42:35] knew the time was soon how long have we
[42:38] been here for that's 2024 folks that's a
[42:41] long time praise the Lord there's a
[42:44] countdown's gone on and God has made us
[42:47] ready to leave amen amen we're trained
[42:49] astronauts Hallelujah I don't know if
[42:51] you realized you're wearing an astronaut
[42:53] suit if you got the baptism of the Holy
[42:55] Ghost you're wearing an astronaut suit I
[42:57] you're you're in the space shuttle
[42:59] greater than the Falcon X or whatever
[43:01] whoever's flying trying to get to Mars
[43:02] no this this this machine we're in if I
[43:05] can call it a machine is a is a
[43:07] interdimensional gateway amen I it's
[43:09] going to take us from this world to the
[43:10] next world not to another planet but to
[43:12] a new a totally new atmosphere a totally
[43:14] new world totally new dimension amen so
[43:18] we can Rejoice we can walk in confidence
[43:21] you see Daniel when he read there in you
[43:23] as in as in Daniel 9 he began to seek
[43:25] God about when the um 70 years was up
[43:28] and things see what cuz he knew his
[43:30] position he knew as a circumcised son of
[43:33] Abraham he could seek the Lord and the
[43:35] Lord could open to him when these things
[43:37] were going to happen and we can we can
[43:39] have confidence that the Lord hears our
[43:41] prayers right that we can stand and
[43:43] intercede for our loved ones we have
[43:46] authority remember a Christian that just
[43:49] gave their life to the Lord a second ago
[43:51] has more Authority in heaven than
[43:53] Gabriel or one of the archangels that
[43:55] never fell
[43:56] why because they're just servants but we
[43:58] are the sons and daughters of the
[44:00] king praise the Lord amen so so when you
[44:03] start praying they've got to be
[44:05] quiet why because because our father
[44:08] says sh Gabriel sh Michael sh my child's
[44:11] talking to me and we think we're low
[44:14] down and we're wretched and we're never
[44:15] going to get anywhere but through the
[44:17] blood of Jesus Christ we are Perfection
[44:19] amen and God is waiting for us to call
[44:21] him on the scene amen amen and we feel
[44:24] like we don't maybe we just feel like
[44:26] our prayer just gets to the ceiling
[44:28] that's it and God hears every part of
[44:30] it we have a position and God wants us
[44:34] to use that position but we can't live
[44:36] in
[44:37] fear that's right see brother B says in
[44:40] God of this evil age I'm going to wind
[44:41] this up soon and when the entire word of
[44:43] God incomplete was headed up in the
[44:44] human body called Jesus Christ and there
[44:47] God made me pay for my sins and him
[44:48] there then he rose me raised me up with
[44:51] him in the resurrection and now we are
[44:52] seated with him with power and authority
[44:54] over every devil yeah amen now we're
[44:57] seated
[44:59] now amen over every devil oh if you
[45:01] could only believe what God has given
[45:04] but if you're not seated there you don't
[45:06] have it and if you're seated there and
[45:07] don't believe it and afraid to move
[45:09] you'll never use it but if you are
[45:11] seated there you will use it for you're
[45:13] ordained to do what you do amen Daniel
[45:16] was ordained to do what he did when they
[45:18] had the prayer meeting and he and and
[45:20] God showed the dream of Nebuchadnezzar's
[45:22] image and everything God showed him why
[45:24] because he was seated in a position and
[45:26] he and he was ordained to do what he did
[45:28] he he he used that position to get in
[45:31] touch with God right how about you and I
[45:35] amen no I'm not telling you anything new
[45:37] right we'll understand these things but
[45:39] we're going to look at the magnitude of
[45:41] what God has done for us amen amen
[45:45] praise the Lord look at the magnitude of
[45:48] it it's a great thing what he has done
[45:51] now let's just I'm just going to finish
[45:53] with this scripture because I'm going to
[45:54] go into a totally different thought I
[45:55] think that'll be Sunday so we'll leave
[45:57] that alone um but you see here it
[45:59] doesn't matter what happened the the the
[46:02] book of Acts church just kept preaching
[46:03] the
[46:04] word and Saul was consenting unto his
[46:07] death and um and at that time there was
[46:10] a great persecution against the church
[46:11] which was at Jerusalem and they were all
[46:13] scattered abroad throughout the regions
[46:15] of Judea Samaria except the apostles and
[46:17] devout men carried Steven to his burial
[46:19] and made a great lamentation over him as
[46:22] for Saul he made Havoc of the church
[46:23] entering into every house and and haing
[46:26] men and women committed them to prison
[46:28] therefore they that were scattered
[46:30] abroad went everywhere preaching the
[46:32] word so they continued doing what they
[46:35] were doing they were a witness in
[46:37] Jerusalem God allowed this pressure to
[46:39] come on they didn't crumble that's right
[46:41] they just kept being who they were
[46:43] somewhere else just like Shadrach mes
[46:46] and a bing on Daniel who they were in
[46:48] Jerusalem they were in Babylon that's
[46:50] right who they were in Babylon they were
[46:52] before the king under pressure no
[46:54] pressure whatever it was they were the
[46:56] same person when the Lord came in that
[46:58] that Daniel couldn't pray for 30 days he
[47:00] knew that law was against him but he
[47:02] kept doing he kept being him whereever
[47:05] whatever was going on did not change him
[47:08] right just like the apostles just like
[47:09] the early church whatever was going on
[47:11] did not changed them did not make them
[47:13] shut up sit down be quiet try no they
[47:16] were believers they knew the Lord amen
[47:19] God was alive that seen Mighty Miracles
[47:21] and wonders the word fulfilled in their
[47:23] day just like we have so whatever
[47:25] pressure came on did not change them
[47:28] they said Lord we're going to go serve
[47:29] you somewhere else where are we going I
[47:31] don't know but Lord you lead us you lead
[47:33] us by your spirit yeah amen I believe
[47:35] we're the same way CU God has restored
[47:37] us back to this whatever is going on in
[47:39] life just go be a Christian wherever the
[47:41] Lord lead you amen we should be who we
[47:44] are
[47:45] everywhere Jesus was the same in front
[47:48] of pilate as he was in front of Herod as
[47:51] he was in front of everyone he was the
[47:53] same Jesus with the publicans and
[47:54] sinners he was Jesus Jesus with Legion
[47:57] he was Jesus with Lazarus you know in
[47:59] his grave he was Jesus he was the same
[48:01] person everywhere he didn't change how
[48:03] he talked didn't change how he did his
[48:04] personality didn't didn't become like
[48:07] the people he was with he was the same I
[48:09] think Daniel would have been the same
[48:11] kind of guy we can be the same kind of
[48:13] person we shouldn't be a different
[48:15] person at home than at church than at
[48:17] work than at school than on the street
[48:19] than on online we should be the same
[48:21] person right we don't we shouldn't have
[48:24] many faces we should have one face we
[48:26] should be one
[48:27] person right that's because we can
[48:30] Daniel Daniel overcame everywhere he
[48:31] went being Daniel how about you as the
[48:35] Bride of Jesus Christ as as a Blood
[48:37] Washed redeemed filled with the Holy
[48:38] Ghost
[48:40] Christian amen so be very strong and
[48:42] courageous amen but I trust I trust that
[48:46] this year not just turning over a new
[48:48] leaf and making some kind of resolution
[48:51] but I pray as we have this prayer
[48:53] meeting tonight let's purpose in our
[48:54] heart say Lord
[48:57] I don't want to keep doing what I've
[48:58] always done I don't want to sit here in
[49:01] fear and doubt and trembling and
[49:02] double-mindedness and wondering if the
[49:05] promise is mine and wondering how these
[49:06] things are going to be I don't want to
[49:08] be that person anymore brother makes a
[49:10] statement you got to come out of
[49:11] unbelief to come into Faith so you got
[49:13] to leave behind all the negative
[49:14] thinking and all the trouble leave it
[49:16] behind that was the past I don't know
[49:19] anyone who clicks all
[49:22] calendars I think they get thrown in the
[49:24] bin maybe some people will do if they do
[49:26] that's fine but you know what I'm saying
[49:29] is you don't you shouldn't hold on to
[49:30] the Past like that normally with every
[49:32] month you flip it you rip off the you
[49:34] have there one picture on the calendar
[49:35] you take the old month you rip it off so
[49:37] it's like the Apostle Paul said
[49:38] forgetting the things which are in the
[49:40] past don't let the past Define you let
[49:43] his word Define who you are and walk in
[49:45] that amen that is our identity not not
[49:48] our mistakes not our family not where we
[49:50] came from all those things that's not
[49:53] who we are in heaven I won't be known
[49:55] for my
[49:57] past we won't be known for our past we
[50:00] won't be known we will not be identified
[50:02] by our troubles when we're dancing
[50:04] around the throne I won't say Brother
[50:07] Andy remember where we came out of
[50:09] remember how you know you know all the
[50:11] problem whatever you know we won't be
[50:12] talking about those things we will still
[50:14] remember testimonies of God's
[50:16] Deliverance but our failures and
[50:18] troubles and
[50:20] complexes
[50:21] Gone Gone totally and it's not in the
[50:25] recyle bit on your computer you can
[50:26] resurrect it it's deleted absolutely by
[50:28] the blood of Jesus Christ so why can't
