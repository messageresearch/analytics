tonight Lord Jesus I pray that you would seiver the ties that tie us to the Earth that you would s the ties that hold us EarthBound s the ties Lord Jesus that keep us from our purpose Hallelujah Lord Jesus father I pray that you would just preach down every life preach down into our thoughts and prove that you're speaking tonight Lord cuz Lord we're depending on you we're the branch Lord and

protection to us here in this place and also those that are streaming Divine protection amnesty from demonic distraction Lord even for those that may not want to be here I pray that tonight they would surrender I pray that you would ward off the demons that are holding them over that are hovering over their heads those spirits and demons of procrastination those demons of lust those demons of fear those Demons of distraction I bind every spirit that is contrary to the word of God in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord I just pray you'd have preeminence amongst us have preeminence I'm inviting you to this pulpit and I pray that everyone in this room would invite you to their Pew to their situation and Lord if there's things in our life that we don't even know are holding us down shine your light upon us tonight we depend on you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Christ and we commit the service to you and we just think of our precious brother Ben and Sister Christine and the duck men Lord off there on their lovely little trip Lord Jesus to to have a good time and I pray they'd have a great time I pray you go beyond all expectation Lord and you would just pour out your spirit and bless them and encourage them and give them traveling mercy and Lord we just now come humbly and reverently and father with all sincerity to your word that you've inspired we believe that you're in this and we believe you've got a purpose for tonight and I pray that we would not miss it that none of us would miss it oh God in Jesus name amen hallelujah God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen thank you brother Josh and thank you musicians Hallelujah while you're standing amen and you know it's a prayer meeting tonight so we're just getting prepared to wage war upon the enemy amen hallelujah you know sometimes we get caught up in the human level and we're praying for all these people but we don't realize that it's Satan that's attacking the people and he gets away you say all these prayers and you pray and you're praying for people and people and things but actually the target is on the devil and when the target's fully on him and you recognize your position then you see results but we're also going to speak on a couple of things tonight that is going to help you unlock the supernatural in your life in a greater measure in a greater way Hallelujah by the Lord's Grace that's in the notes anyway you never know what the Lord might do you know how it goes if you pull and you got needs then you pull amen are you with me are we together we're together again just praising the Lord amen hallelujah I won't leave you standing too long but I want to speak tonight on a subject called wrestling with surrender wrestling with surrender come on Hallelujah and and I had this this was already in motion this was already um planned you know that that was already well uh in the uh wine seller getting sweeter and vintage was getting and then Ben finishes his sermon on wrestling with the angel and I thought Lord you definitely got some plans Hallelujah and so I was getting excited cuz Ben was just preaching all my notes and everything I thought man praise God but I'm just going to preach it as it was so as it is amen so let's just turn our Bibles to Mark 8: 34-35 and amen or you can just read it on here and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him or her deny himself or deny herself and take up hers or his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it amen you may be seated Hallelujah isn't he good to us isn't he a wonderful God he's just so faithful oh boy there's people calling me oh my praise God he is so faithful he's faithful to his word he's faithful in all things amen and I believe that tonight the subject that he's got for us is not just so that we can sit here Al loan but this subject is in is so that we can have an experience with him in a further surrender all of us there is no one in this room that doesn't need to surrender something oh yes and sometimes you don't know sometimes you don't know and there's a I'm we'll just get into it but like you know like sometimes you you're just going about and you're busy but there's things that are holding you back and you wonder why that you always struggling I was listening to why people so tossed about today and the prophet was speaking about um you know he had that question he was like man cuz you know when you get saved and I'm just going to speak for myself here I I can identify brother brandom you get so so so so saved that there's you're just in Christ and you're always rejoicing right and it was it was simple it happened in one experience for me and it can happen to all of you all of us and and and so brother brandom had this question he was like why are people so tossed about all these Pentecostal ministers and everything in his day struggling with adulteries and struggling with this and struggling all over the place high-profile low everybody that's right and he's like why and he asked the question he preached it and he said because the entire Christian walk is based upon rest but to truly and unequivocally enter into rest we must be totally surrendered and to totally surrender we must totally trust and to totally trust I'm not just talking about up here because every single one in this room unless you're not really caring about these things but everyone in this room totally trusts the Lord up here and in your soul but the problem is down in your subconscious that's where the problem lies that's where the battle lies and it's those little written things in your subconscious or experiences and things that you've had in your life or dysfunctional upbringings or dysfunctional masculinity or dysfunctional femininity and all that stuff that's all out there corruption and a lot of us have been brought up under those things and have been exposed to those things or been molested or we've been hurt or we've been broken and yet we come to the Lord and we've been healed and we have a glor glorious time but yet locked up down there is still that thing until God deals with it or until you're willing to let him deal with it and maybe there's things that you can't surrender you find it so hard to surrender it's because deep down in your subconscious there is a struggle to trust God as a father or God as a husband or maybe you're struggling to surrender to become the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a lot of things right I'll cover a few I can't promise that I'll cover everything but we'll just be obedient to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit are you with me Lord hallelujah amen you know Jesus Christ and I want to just I'm just going to make a statement Jesus Christ is totally trustworthy on every level amen I want you all to say that with me Jesus Christ is totally trustworthy on every level if you just say say that and believe that I don't know it sounds like you know like some psychological thing like confess and confession and confession but if you just speak that and believe that it will actually anchor down in your in your heart and your subconscious because it's it's trust and Ben was hitting it hard it's trust and I pray that tonight if there is mistrust down in your heart that God will heal you so that you can truly surrender so that you can stop being tied to the world so that you can stop struggling up up and down like a roller coaster struggling with the world looking at the wrong things and can't get out of it why cuz you're holding you're teed you're meant to be flying free With the Wind of the Holy Ghost yeah right you're meant to be you got a purpose with God you got to totally rest and let him carry you right but you're tethered by little things that you're holding on to and you can be filled up and filled up and filled up and filled up and go have a glorious time at camp and it's like pulling pulling hard but you're still teed let it go you have the power to loose amen you have the power to bind amen so stand up and fight hallelujah it's time to get real with the devil amen oh yes I know you're real with God but sometimes you we just let the devil get away with murder let the devil get away with all these things and we pray for people like us we just keep praying for people and people and we get those prayest and we'll have them tonight people people people I don't even know half of the people but what about getting the devil the one that's causing the trouble and actually sitting before God and saying God reveal to me the cause of this that's War do you think Israel just willy-nilly went in there and started firing all their guns bombing the whole thing you know nuke the whole thing no Precision Warfare why because they got to get down deep into those tunnels that's what God is doing he's declaring over there in a natural type what he's doing in your life now he wants to get down deep in your tunnels deep into your subconscious and heal you tonight real healing and real war against an enemy that is destroying your families your children destroying your friends destroying you if he can to pull you down into a vision of defeat death and depression but he's defeated himself Hallelujah he's defeated the Lord hallelujah I'm just going to keep reading I I had little signs on here don't say anything until you finish reading the stuff help me Jesus Hallelujah if I just push this it's going to go to a day yeah I believe that God can use me tonight to speak some things to you that will help you truly trust him it's a surrender so I want you to open your heart amen really open your heart tonight like don't try and learn this you know we're going on a journey but just don't try and learn now I just want you to open up and say God heal me God help me to truly trust trust you I've been hurt Lord in many ways in my life but tonight I'm coming for healing and to surrender whatever you put on my heart whatever is holding me back what's tethering me to the world Matthew 11:28-30 says come unto me all ye that labor in a heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I'm meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light the entire Christian faith is based on rest your Victory is based on totally resting in him but to totally rest in him is a total trust and a total surrender to him and his kingdom and not only will you be able to trust him but you'll be able to trust his people and that's another thing you've got to be able to trust him in his bride him in his body so that you can be edified so that you can be healed so that you can be blessed so that you can bless he will open up your communication he'll be open up your conversation this here is to show you his position in Isaiah 62:4 to5 and remember as I'm reading this he's he's this doesn't matter what your past what future what you're going through right that's in time and that's based on what's happening and it's variable and there's Devils out there and you also got an old nature that you're wrestling to surrender right that's right so regardless of all that and I could the Bible's filled with these sort of promises but I just found one Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but Thou shalt be called hipa and thy land buer I like that he's going to make it all beautiful inside you and he's got it all planned out and mapped out and we're all on a journey and we're at varying places with the Lord of what's Happening inside you in the Kingdom that is in you he's working he's busy and he's very trustworthy he says here for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a Young Man Marth a virgin this is the Lord's position this is what he thinks of you right shall thy Sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice over thee amen hallelujah isn't he wonderful as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice over thee God's rejoicing over you he cares about you he cares about your future he cares about your development he is is Keen on you he he he's interested he's interested in your life your outcome he's interested in all of the things about you he wants to work in your life Hallelujah the Lord he rejoices over you I mean who else would who's the greatest one that could Rejoice over us how King the creator of heavens and earth rejoicing over me my you get all these great people out there in the world they don't Rejoice over you all those YouTube stars and Twitter stars and oh man I'm probably sounding old but what is that one lock Tik Tok stars all that stuff they're not rejoicing over you H they're just fake fake man oh boy I won't get into that right now and you believe beli by faith like Abraham did and was given the Seal of circumcision for a confirmation of his faith and you believe and accept Jesus as your savior then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith you say you believe and haven't received the Holy Spirit something wrong with your faith God circumcises the heart the minute the believer really comes and full surrender so if you're up and down in and out you're not in the holy of holies and your life is up and down there's your there's the key full surrender Hallelujah and if you're struggling to do that then get get on your knees and say God heal me what is it that's stopping me why is there an image inside me somewhere an idol is there something that I'm thinking wrong you know when you really get serious with God and you really mean and you say search My Heart Lord Jesus what is it it can be a small thing that's holding you back from a true baptism of the holy spirit because this is the key to a a real Christian Life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost unfortunately as Jesus says many are called but few are chosen straight As the gate and narrow as the way that leadth unto life but few there be that find it but I believe that I'm speaking to a people that have found it Hallelujah and God in his Mercy is here tonight to heal you to undo all of the confusion to take away all anything that would T you to the world yeah that would tether you to the ground that would hold you only so far to make you plateau in your faith that's it that's what God wants is not that bord a line halfway but an absolute full surrender to the kingdom of God Amen where are you are you totally surrendered and resting in Christ are you partially surrendered and open to surrender more both of those places a good places to be and I think we should be that's where we should be that's the place of a of a True Believer with the right attitude towards any Divine promise right amen are you partially surrendered and not currently open to surrender more you know sometimes we can dig our feet in the ground sometimes we can get a little stubborn sometimes we can get a little hurt in the church or a little hurt between people and then that stops you moving on and you've let your War go into a natural Arena but your war is not against flesh and blood blood as against spiritual wickedness in high places to the pulling down of strongholds and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ are you backslid into selfishness needing to surrender again and fully this time no more nonsense no more nonsense yeah I got to be careful I don't look at people you know CU then they might think I'm talking to them you know I always wondered you know brother Adrian he's a real um he's a real evangelist you know but also quite a you know he gets into the depths of the word but he he never looks at people and I thought man because he knows he he says things that are very raw and striking and sometimes you say those things and you're looking at you know you're just looking at people cuz you do and then they're like oh boy am I is that me oh man you know or are you not surrendered but you're still on the fence with God these I'm just now just we're just laying out some of the different positions that we can find ourselves in okay or not surrendered and totally against the will of God and I'm sure that there's probably more but in this room we're one of these amen hallelujah I just put this together so it's the graphics aren't too good but you're like this hot air balloon right and you've got all this joy and and you go you come to church and you get filled up and you and you you know you you're rejoicing and and that but you feel like sometimes I'm only going so far why what's stopping me and so I was looking at a few different things of what it would be that would could hold us on the earth that could just limit us to keep us going up and and down to keep us fighting a carnal battle why aren't you overcoming why are you still struggling with these common things that people of the world struggle with what is it what's tethering you to the Earth what's keeping you on the ground what's keeping you maybe you're not on the ground like I've shown here but you're just flying up a little bit and there's a few different things that I as I was looking into this let's just say you have a gondola or or a hot air balloon and it's Tethered to the ground with ropes and you want to go up don't put more hot air in the balloon or more things that will lift it up untie the tethers and you will naturally go up so the right thing to do is not worry about going up I mean hey the Lord his purpose is for you to go on a Rapture his purpose is for you to be free his purpose for you is to love to be connected to be able to associate to be able to integrate with all the people and and get on with people and be one of those ones that if you go you know what I don't know their friends from their enemy they're just so lovely and so nice all the time what is it about those people what has why are those people like that because all the tethers to the Earth have been broken and they they they they they're F flying soaring like an eagle with God so don't worry about going up the power of God will take us in his purpose let go of what's holding you down and if you will let go of those tethers believe me your whole being will go up naturally exactly at the pace that it should everything will unfold perfectly but you have to be willing to let go of what's holding you down and I just want to go through some of the struggles that we have with surrender what's tethering you I'm asking this question is it a fear of missing out Children I've asked children this before and this is what they went to you know what's tethering you to totally surrender and become absolutely fanatically joyous for the Lord not worried about what other people think you know like a total surrender to God and I ask these questions to all of us but specifically to to the children does surrender mean that all your fun will be taken does it mean that all your creative flare you can be this cool thing oh you know and Everyone likes you at school and Everyone likes you wherever you go you just call you fit in and you you're like a chameleon and you just become this at school and this at church and then this in the Sunday school and then this at church lunch and then this in front of your family and then this when your family's not there got seven faces seven personalities oh boy oh my you know will it will surrendering take that away no it'll take surrendering will take the falseness of it away but it won't take away your creative flare it won't take away the expression of who you really are but what will what it will do is you'll be the same you'll be like and I said I say this to my children cuz you know they go through things and they ask me questions and I said you know when you totally surrender and you totally untether yourself from the world and untether yourself from all of these things that you think are your Comforts and your who you are and all these things that you've got in place to try and be something and you just lay it all down and you let God reveal who you are and then people love you for that that's sustainable living you don't have to put put nothing on you don't have to change your face you remember how was I you know because you can get so confused now cuz that group of friends you're like this that group of friends are like that and all of a sudden you've got 40 different faces to be but tonight you can be healed of that fear of missing out amen tonight you can be healed of that fear of not fitting inlj there's a fear there especially under the peer pressure the devil is peer pressure that comes from Satan to make children feel like they they a fear of not fitting in but I said to my children especially in the environment here and also around if you just let Jes if you just be the real you the real you yeah and let and totally surrender Jesus will bring out the real you and that real you when they love you for that for who you really are that's Eternal that that's not something that's fickle that's not something that's built on the Sands of of man's ideas or what you think of your opinions because remember what you think when you're this age and then when you start growing up it's all changing all the time by the time you're 20 you'd be crazy you'd be mentally unstable we don't want to be mentally unstable so even as a child as a young one you can totally be healed of the fear of missing out the fear of not fitting in the fear of looking like you're weird because you're dressing differently than all these other girls and boys and whatever you have that the Lord has revealed to you that is right and when you totally untether yourself you are totally free and now you're flying now you're unhitched from the control of man's ideas the control of what your friends think the control of what mommy and daddy think even because now you're free to actually be to express Christ and then you don't even have to worry that what you do is bad or wrong or good or whatever because the Lord is leading you you're free to be yourself totally unequivocally free amen hallelujah does surrender under the fear of missing out does it mean you lose your open mind you know my mom she told me when I became a Christian she goes she cried actually and I thought she was she was giving her life to the Lord but she was actually she actually cried because she's like my son's lost his open mind I thought my my mind has just come off from than it's ever beenen you know I've been the the the fullness of God and all these great events that's taking place in our generation and everything that's going on and my mind's become right open to God to the Creator you know like man when you totally surrender don't have a fear of losing your open mind or losing the ability you know you know do you lose all your Ambitions and dreams does do your dreams disappeared you know no but you surrender them you lay them at the foot of the cross lay them down don't be afraid because you see part of those things will be part of your you know if they're pure and they're real true um Ambitions and dreams and they're right You' be surprised how many of those are actually true and God's placed that desire in you but when you're willing to surrender it will untether you from you won't be held down by you trying to drive it you are trying to make it happen right we don't want to try and make it happen it's not in us to to do that what God is asking is that we just totally surrender that to him the fear of losing control of your comfort stream my my every human being is looking for Comfort every person you sit down down and what is going to produce dopamine for you tonight what is going to make you feel happy tonight what is going to entertain you you know we all have comfort streams everything we do we do for a better life surrounded by people and things that Comfort us physically and spiritually mentally whether it's charity or greed you know we we we bring things into our life we we go and get a job and we want to earn more money so we can buy nice things so that we can be more comfortable we want to live in a nice house we want nice couches we we we want a nice bed you want nice things right God wants you to surrender that tonight Surrender Your Right to have comfort because this world will provide you so much comfort but remember what the Lord said I will comfort you yeah that doesn't mean oh oh man we got to go sell all our cches and beds and houses and everything and everything that I built up all my Comforts man I'm like the creature Comfort man if anyone knows me well I like Comforts but I had to so totally give them over to the Lord and say Lord you can take them if you want you can take me anywhere you want I'm totally in your hands I'm cutting all my Ties on those ropes see those ropes all these these things holding me on the earth I don't want any of them and I pray with all my heart that tonight you are the same whatever vices are holding you on the earth s them tonight don't be afraid to lose control of your comfort stream because I can tell you now I can give you a spiritual guarantee that the comfort that you get out of the Holy Ghost is a billion trillion times greater than anything that this world can give and anything that you can try in your own strength to bring together to make yourself happy and comfortable and entertained oh boy help us Lord help me Lord you know and and there's a fear of missing those things there's a fear of losing control of those things right but we don't have to be under fear you're not being given the spirit of bondage to fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Hallelujah are you with me amen hallelujah I feel like we're kind of just like pressing the plow right now but we're just getting there we're getting through the foundational thought but I've got some things coming so amen hallelujah you just pay good attention to this surrender all your finances fear of having no money so that causes you now I've got to be have the this job because this job pays more but have you are you able to go no God is that the job for me but there's another job there that's less money and you're feeling in your heart I just feel like that's the job but but you're fearful and you you're not willing to go for this job uh that job because this job is paying less and it's harder but there's a purpose there but he's got this job and it's or there's another job offered to you and it's got more money and there's a package and there's cars and everything involved and it looks so good and now you're at a Crossroads are you willing to surrender your finances to the Lord to give them all of them you you think about it right you give God your finances you surrender everything all your money everything to the Lord he will bless you he's your provider he's Jehovah gyro right you don't need to worry you never ever have to worry about finances you could just everything can be crumbling around you but if you just have faith in him and you believe his promises are true and yay and amen surrender your finances to the Lord pay your tithes to the house of God don't hold back because you'll curse yourself that still stands today I know there's theologians out there that try and explain that stuff into the Old Testament but God still promised that if you give your tith to the house of the Lord you'll be blessed yes and it actually shows whether you're scared or not cuz if you have all your bills right and your bills are all cter for and you've only got a little bit of coffee money and everything else is gone and you and and you you look at it and you go I cannot pay for 10% it's just not there you're scared you're afraid and you're living in fear but you can be healed tonight of fear of fear and I've seen people that have been in that and worse they're in dead every week they're just going deck I said just pay your tithe that's it you just pay your tithe and you got less and you might be a couple of weeks before something kicks in oh yeah but it might happen instantly but all of a sudden behind you the bank of Heaven starts coming on the scene and Jehovah Gyra says finally I can see them now working in faith hallelujah amen you can't outg give God God is is tremendously um you know he loves to bless he says it's far more blessed to give than to receive so God said that that means that that's what he thinks so he loves to give he gave his life Hallelujah Lord hallelujah in John 14:18 it says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you he is your comfort right I am the door John 10:9-10 it says I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but to for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly I was like Lord why might might and you know what the answer is choices what choices are you going to make will you make choices cuz this is all your free will you can give your life and be a great Christian what was you know and go so far but there's choices that you make that keep you tethered choices not to surrender choices not to give that last thing that of over to the Lord because of some reason or some upbringing or some wrong image in your subconscious that's holding you back from truly surrendering all and I thought Lord I do not want to be in the might I'm want to be guaranteed Abundant Life I want to be guaranteed joy unspeakable and full of Glory GL I want to be guaranteed peace Shalom to you shalom in the name of the Lord Jesus receive it receive his love because his love is what will neutralize the fear that is stopping you from surrendering whatever that creature Comfort is that is holding you back and has held you back the Lord says he will wait and he will be patient and he will wait but remember it is your choices that is stopping you from having an abundant life it is your choices that's stringing you to the world and all that happens no matter what you do you go to church week after week you go to camps you go to these great sermons all and you hear the word and great experiences but you never get any higher than that because you're tethered because you're holding on to things you're you're you're afraid to let go of what's comforting you and therefore you're not getting access to the comforter you're allowing a devil's invention to comfort you I know these sound harsh but remember everything from the Tree of knowledge comes from the devil civilization comes from the the the PO the the that that it's a result of the corruption in the Garden of Eden they corrupted by by by taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and listening to the lies of the enemy and coming un his wisdom and they started listening and now they've been look at the civilizations that came from C and all the technology and everything that was here and you will let that be your comfort and it's that's the reason why your joy only goes so much and your peace is only so much and then you find yourself struggling and you find yourself battling again and you find yourself doing things that Christians don't do and you wonder why but you know why deep down we all know why if we're really sincere and really you know if we really search our life and let God search us and when the preacher is preaching you ain't pitchforking it over to the one that you know is also into or doing that or you think they're doing that or whatever but you're actually owning it and sometimes you got to own stuff that's hurt you some sometimes you got to own stuff the pastor's preaching and it's taking the hide off you you got to own that cuz that's your word that's your word hallelujah and when you own it then the Lord can deal with you oh yes Proverbs 16:9 it says a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directs his steps you think of a computer you know I think I've got a picture here there we go look at this good old Apple That's my kind of computer man that's what we used to play on huh it took about half an hour to load and you had about seven or eight discs and it had one game on it and it was all green green man that was real computers man those were chunky things right huh but anyway think of a computer most of us are Savvy with computers you'll understand that in a computer there's Ram which is random access memory there is a processor which is like the brain and there is uh graphics card which gives you the visuals and all of those right can be totally powerful and there's a hard drive which stores all the data right so between those things it kind of talks together and does this and then presents to you the information on the screen so you can have and you are you've got the greatest Ram you've got the greatest Graphics you've got the greatest componentry you've even got the greatest hard drive but I tell you what you can have the greatest computer that's ever been invented but if your hard drive is full of just rubbish rubbish just full information overload full your hard drive just totally full of all sorts of stuff because you just allow everything in and you just install all these stupid games and apps and everything and it just fills your thing with spy wear fry wear viruses and every where huh all that stuff filling the hard drive then and I'm talking about computers now you your hard drive get full and you can have the best everything and it's everything's clunky and it's just not working you're like why isn't it working and then you go down to the file manager you think on there and the bar's red you're like ah it's red and now you're like oh man I've done this like how many times I've done this how many times now all the stuff on there I'm struggling to delete now cuz it's all getting better oh what do you do okay you got to format that thing you got to get rid of all that spy wear fry wear app wear everything huh sorry Ando I'm taking your your little question it's like a Brahman told me off she's like stop doing that thing that brother and Pa does but I like them you know it's like when you like somebody you pick up their their their ways you know well I do anyway some people are probably more controlled but I'm just like man if I like somebody I start talking like them and oh man help me Lord okay so this the same thing with us when our hard drive gets full of all the stuff that in this world sometimes it takes you just got to hit the delete button what that's doing is it's tethering you it's bulking you up it's slowing you down all these things things are holding you on the ground this one's for the men natural masculinity verse Divine femininity oh boy that's a big phrase natural masculinity verse Divine femininity brings a hard transition for men to give up their natural manhood to take on the divine feminine role as the Bride of Jesus Christ all the boys they just magnetized to David and and and all these Great Men of the Bible but then when it comes if you say to these boys do you identify as Ruth do you identify as as Rahab and do you identify as as Deborah the boys are like what trying to make me a girl and then the men you know so we can become very masculine and we can be worldly masculine and we can fail to identify as the Bride of Jesus Christ but let me tell you this the only way to understand and express true masculinity I'm talking real Divine masculinity in the flesh is to embrace Divine femininity in the spirit you can only become a real man when you become a real wife and I'm talking to men and women but mainly the men right now amen because sometimes we get so Macho and stoic and I'm a man and a lot of that is just fear you're afraid your identity isn't sure and steadfast yet and we we work our we work our muscles and we become strong and tough because we want to attract but think about this true masculinity is not found in muscle it's good cuz we need to be chalous and we need to be able to help we need to be to protect it's part of being a man you know and you feel like you can protect but the hes prepared unto the day of battle but safety is of the Lord now to be to have true protection in your house is not by our muscles or our guns or our crowbars or whatever we have by our beds it's only by the Lord's Angels amen amen so I believe that a true believer's house that's that that that that that that's not a welcoming Devils into their house by whatever they're watching and doing or saying or treating however you are in your home with your family or by yourself if you're not welcoming demons because some of those tethers do that some of those tethers that we have in our lives can welcome demons and I've had people Christians come and stay at my house and you know they got demons cuz they bring demons into the house and the demons come up and try and attack they're like oh who are these people and they come up and they start trying to attack us in our and then they know they're getting a battle and then those demons they regret when that happens in your house they should have just hid themselves outside down the road and not even showed their face cuz they ended up so fast down and out of Darkness because you've got Authority you can cast Devils into outer Darkness if you know who you are amen hallelujah on but anyway these tethers and sometimes you if if the te let's say you've got those or what ever but if you're not well if your your house is is is pure then there is rings of angels around your house protecting you and Devils can try all they want they just can't get in you've got an identic condition the Lord creates a Haven for you in your home Hallelujah so that you can be a real man but let me just tell you this you need to embrace Divine femininity brothers so that you can become a real man amen you need to identify yourself as the Bride of Jesus Christ so you become a real man and a real man you know Solomon failed to surrender his desire for forbidden woman of heathen Nations he eventually pulled back and turned away from the Lord you know we don't want this to happen in our life so don't let that type of masculinity that's fake masculinity that's actually not like the masculinity that they put out there that is not real masculinity real masculinity is is is honoring to the Fe female it's actually redeeming to the female it's you real masculinity expressed brings the female to walk beside you it actually brings her up to you you you become together that's why the Lord Jesus Christ as the true masculine image you know the true husband he is your real husband woman ladies sisters he's your real husband and brothers he's your real husband you know the true masculine image Glory but if we're not you know we get caught up in these other masculine images and and and you know it can it can you know what we can get influenced by these things of the world and we can pull pull away it can help we can stop us from walking with the Lord and we can pull away pull back but the Lord has no joy in seeing his people pull back you know this action of Solomon led to the destruction of Jerusalem Paul though Paul a Jewish scholar a man of great Prestige of the highest religious order in Israel he had a lot to boast about as we've read in the Bible he was willing to surrender everything and untether himself from all his prestige all of his status in the world what his friends thought about him he was friends with the high priest huh what about you go out there and you become friends with with with great men of the earth Great Men of this world but are you willing to surrender all of that to be untethered so that you can be free this guy here does anyone ever heard of hero or no this is for the brothers because you know we can be stubborn the sisters can uh you can just enjoy the ride your turn's coming in a [Laughter] second this man Isaac actually told me about this man when we were driving one time because I must have been going down this route of conversation but this man is amazing he's got the most tenacity you could ever imagine for a worldly man so World War II you know the Japanese were against the Allies so they were the evil force obviously in their eyes they were wanting to conquer the world and so they were the goodies but as far as we're concerned they're the baddies right they were the ones that they bombed Pearl Harbor and then then they declared America declared war and they joined in with the other um baddies but anyway so this guy here was let me just read this hio trained as an intelligence officer in the Commando class of the futata and the futata Bano of the Nano school on 26th of December 1944 he was sent to lebano island in the Philippines and he was ordered now remember who ordered him it was a it was an evil man an evil directive just like your old nature just like the devil right or some corrupted influence in your life something that's tethering you right to holding you down He was ordered to do all he could to hamper enemy attacks on the island including destroying the airst strip and the peer at the harbor onoda's orders also stated that under no circumstance was he to surrender or to take his own life which the Japanese used to do and they still probably do in the samurai world but anyway this man was told by this thing Never Surrender by some evil force do not give up do not surrender you just do this evil stuff and you stay doing evil you stay Tethered to this island this is what you do until you hear further orders from me amen so so he's on this island and he's doing all the stuff he actually came under the command of other people so he couldn't carry out his thing and then the Americans took took the island all that sort of stuff but anyway the war was over and for 35 years this man rage Guerilla Warfare from his little position on the island he stayed under the orders and people they were sending Fliers and he was he killed about 20 people over the and and it wasn't until 1976 that what actually happened is that he raged all these things but in 1976 finally a man who heard about him and this guy instead of just going there and trying to be he needed a friend and so this man this this guy he went there to the island and he actually befriended this guy on not but under no circumstances was this guy going to surrender there was nothing in him to surrender anything so he just kept fighting and he keept pushing under an evil order for 35 years he kept fighting and the war was over his his whole Vision everything was wrong and he killed all these people and he brought people down until this man came who was a bit of a kind of like a hippie sort of guy from Japan and he actually went there and he said and he got to know him and he finally found out why this guy wasn't surrendering and he was cuz he's a trained army guy you know no he had shootouts with the cops he had ammo he had grenades he had everything from World War II 35 years sometimes we find ourselves bunkering ourselves into a way that we are and we're failing to surrender to the voice of God and we're holding on because some evil thing told us this thing many years ago and we're holding on and we're holding on and we're hearing messages and we're hearing things this is the way walk you in it this is the way of the Lord this is the will of the Lord this is what we Ser many people they stay hunkered down into a certain vision and they hold their ground but then it takes a friend it takes someone with love to go and find out why so this guy was raging War for all these years and no one knew why and it was that he was told never to surrender and he would not he he every time that things came and newspapers they sent them newspapers they didn't believe it they thought it was a setup because under no circumstance so you surrender under no circumstance should you change under no circumstance should you come come into a new vision to realize that that war that battle is futile cuz that Vision under that Japanese regime was finished 30 odd years ago and sometimes we're holding to a vision of years ago and our image is old it's pasted and it's not current we're holding to it but it's time to let it go it's tethering it's tethered him he was tended for 35 years in a in a state of war and he could have been at peace he could have had family he could have done all these great things and yet he was stuck and bunkered and maybe this might not be for anyone in this room but someone on that tape may be listening and if you are listening on that tape now or later on repent turn away from your wicked ways and let God bring you into the present Revelation CU it's time it's time you know and so this friend he actually found out why he was like this what orders he had followed and they brought the this was 35 years later so the general that gave him the orders they actually brought him to the island to tell him to stand down he had to be officially stood down by his General oh brothers let's not get too stubborn let's not get too dig our heels in and stay the same way but why not I embrace Divine femininity cuz to to to this this type of let's say the anoda complex can hinder us and tether us from really developing as a man we can get our feet stuck in the ground and we can have an ambition we can have a a some sort of as brother Ben's been preaching on recently you know some impression we just get a little impression and and we don't even get God to confirm it in the mouth of two or three Witnesses we just go and do it and we stick to it and we stay with it but actually it's false we're being in a NOA but it's time that we Embrace Divine femininity start identifying with Ruth start identifying with Rahab and Sarah some of those females in the Bible and start seeing him as a husband or have you been hurt by your dad have you been hurt by men in leadership and I'm talking to Brothers but I'm talking to sisters now too because being hurt by men can actually distort female image of masculinity and unfortunately because of the wars there's a lot of men that were Unfaithful and fathers you know and our grandfathers a lot of us and our fathers were broken and Shell Shocked by the war and you know sisters your image of God as a father may be corrupted by Earthly cares and failures but his image of you is perfect and he wants to heal you tonight if you're unable to really receive God as a father men women children your image of the Son of God Is Your Divine husband may be decimated by experiences with people on the world on the Earth but his thoughts and image of you as a bride is Rich with love and affection I got this this thing here was really a touching he says an 80-year old man insists every morning on bringing his wife breakfast in the nursing home and when asked why is his wife in a retirement home he he replied she has Alzheimer's disease so he was asked and this is I believe this is the man would your wife be worried if one day you didn't come and bring her breakfast and he said she doesn't remember she doesn't even know who I am she hasn't recognized me for 5 years surprised the nurse asked him why do you bring your wife breakfast every morning even though she doesn't recognize you and the man smiled looked her in the eyee and said she doesn't know who I am but I know who she is you know that's like the Lord many times we've got a distorted image in our subconscious of him as husband or his father because of corrupted fathers or corrupted husbands that have hurt us or corrupted male figures in our life that have broken our spirit and you may not know him how he you should because of these things because of molestation because of of deep hurts from men filthy disgusting Beast animal men that have done horrible wicked things but that's not our Jesus and tonight if you're struggling with that image he's here to heal you because he wants you to surrender to him as husband to him as father there was a brother and he was um the brother uh there was a pastor that came over years ago and he told a story about a man in his congregation who could not receive the Holy Ghost and he was so sincere and and he went into counseling for it and the Lord by divine revelation revealed to the pastor what the problem was and he asked them he said has your dad done a really nasty thing to you when you were a child and he says yes actually and the whole memory just came back up and he actually started crying and the what it was is that he he left the hose on or he didn't he he did something that wasn't even that bad but he made a mistake his dad came home and he had the greatest new Lego truck or whatever it was in the car and he showed him the truck and he said if you didn't if you had turned that hose off I would have given you this and he had been wanting it for months and months and he fin was going to get it and his dad showed him it and said but it's not yours I'm going to give it away and he never got it and he said that complex laid in that man subconscious and he couldn't trust God as a father to be true to his promises this is how a little thing in your life can hold you back and tether you to the Earth I'm sorry that I'm going further and into our prayer time but I believe this is important see Mary when she this is now Mary she got this was a time of transition for Mary Mary she was at the tomb and she had looked in she was looking for Jesus as she had seen him she was her image of Jesus was was the Jesus of uh of the past and yet only 3 or 4 days ago she saw Jesus as another man older more worn out bigger you know and the last time she saw him he he was covered in blood and he was suffering and so her image of him was not correct until he spoke and I believe tonight you know she turned around and she saw him and she thought he was the gardener and so she was looking at the very present revelation of Jesus Christ and yet she couldn't see him but he knew her and he was willing think about this to see that she could see him right what are you looking at to see that she could see him he was willing to stop on the way taking his blood into Glory from the cross down to Hell and then back up he stopped and said I've got someone that needs me right now there is no job too small for Lord and I believe tonight the Lord is not too busy for you he's not too busy to heal you so that you can come untethered he's not too busy there's no job too minor you might think I it's just a little thing you know that I'm doing it's just a little thing that I've held on to it's just a little thing you know don't think that it's a little thing to the Lord he cares he cared enough to stop so that Mary would turn around and see and he would speak her name so that she could come into the full manifestation and know who he is and and and and and and be reassured and be healed of the pain that she was going through Hallelujah Mary had a stale image you could say of Jesus in his partial revelation but she was standing in front of him in his eternal Revelation and when he spoke to her everything came open woman with trust issues towards masculinity struggled to totally open up to the Divine male image of Christ Abused Women broken homes social phobias through failed relationships woman brought up by Broken spirited mothers that you know so sometimes it's not the experience that you go through from your own father but your mother might have gone through the same thing or worse and their complexes get brought onto you they're called learn behaviors and women many times today have been raised masculine and the role has forged to a rut in their subconscious and they struggle to come into a divine feminine role I mean I grew up around woman like that they were very Butch they were very Macho they were very able they were very able to do things they were very competent and man you say one thing about them being you know you know like uh like a misogynistic type of thing may you would be wearing it it was bad you know and and and so there was there was like a massive like it was horrible it's actually a very bad place and a lot of people have been raised that way you know my sister was raised that way man you know far out we had a lot of hardships together you know and the reason for this is war torn conditions broke masculinity and fathers a total absence of Father Figure both physically and relationally Unfaithful fatherhood and selfish fatherhood I say Brothers we cannot raise our children like that let's have the musicians and then we'll pray can you play that song I Give Myself Away oops sorry can you put it back I wasn't [Music] finished it's stand this whole sermon was just a foundation it's not not a usual but I want you to deeply think about these things listen to what the prophet says he says I've often thought how we've deprived ourselves how we've robbed God of his plan by not surrendering Our Lives completely to him if everything that we have to him how that we have disallowed his program how we've lingered May tonight if you've lingered Sarah waited 30 odd years before she got the promise how long are you lingering remember God said he will [Music] wait and have made him to wait and wait and wait trying to find somebody that he could work through trying to find a man somewhere that he could put confidence in some man that would surrender everything and I believe tonight we can surrender everything as we sing the song and we'll go to prayer but just one more thing I'm just going to read one more quote now if a person completely surrendered to the devil will give him twice his strength what will a man completely surrendered to God do See it'll make you so weak maybe you're crippled and can't stand up that can be physically and spiritually but surrender yourself to God and New Life a new strength comes in and you go to walking away I seen little people when their little limbs wasn't hardly that big and he's talking about bones growing men and women eat up with cancer rise to the floor that hadn't stood up for months so weak they couldn't have stood up any other way but under the power of God and get up and walk around through the house praising God and get well what is it full surrender to God Amen that's what it takes a complete surrender and I just want you now as we pray if there's anything that is tethering you to this earth any fear is of what other people think or any Creature Comforts or control or finances or anything that's tethering you stubbornness seeing Jesus in a wrong way or you're you're bruised from the things that you've learn or upbringings or whatever it may be that's stopping you from surrendering and being a real bride and bringing a true wife or a true husband he's here tonight to restore true masculinity he's here tonight to to to restore true femininity not that rubbish out there they're confused they don't even know what a woman is anymore they don't know what a man is oh man but God knows God is trustworthy I trust Jesus do you trust him tonight will you surrender that thing that control that future that ambition that dream that Finance will you surrender what people think in your right to your Comforts will you surrender your future will you surrender he says come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest I will put the sword in your hand so that you can cut those tethers tonight so that you can be free to do the will of God amen so that you can soar in the Heavenly e led by the wind as so he chooses not what you choose not your future it's his future in you Sons and Daughters of God rise up and get the sword of the spirit and loose yourself because you're so full of life and so full of the power of God that is invested in you tonight now that the moment that you s that tie you're going to s you're going to rise and it will take you into the Rapture but you must let it go let it go
