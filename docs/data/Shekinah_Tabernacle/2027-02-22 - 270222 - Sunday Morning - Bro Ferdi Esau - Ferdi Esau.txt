live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness with my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my beard and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth heart after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice in god everyone that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped amen so we're just going to pray one more time but i'm looking forward to hearing from god today i mean i believe that brother i mean our lord jesus has

few months and so i hope it's a blessing to you as well [Music] there may be storms that won't move out the way and trials may come to only test my faith what i've learned about your favor your mercy

testifying of your healing if you want to say a few things if you want to see i'll leave the floor to you amen [Applause] yeah it's really intimidating yeah yeah oh wow such a surprise um god bless you yeah i think you know that's how just testify yeah if us oh my heart stop pumping if i have to really say the goodness of god i may stand here till probably tomorrow keep on talking and yeah i don't know i just know that the lord loves me so much he really loves me sometimes i don't know why because i'm not even wealthy office worthy of his love and care and he just loves me so much and yeah yeah so yeah i was heading if i can just start from there i was heading on because it's really rare for us to to attend the service because we live four hours away from christchurch and three hours from uh from nelson and the south island roads are really windy that's one of the things that sets me off when i think of driving and the other thing is i work at school and if i have to attend the service i'll have to spend the night in in christchurch or either nelson and attend the service and drive the next day back home so i don't often go to church i have a very busy sunday i start by zooming uh pastor greg's church and then i zoom wellington church and sometimes i zoom auckland church last night today like yeah so i just that's how we occupy ourselves and keep ourselves in the way then so yeah on the 26th of december i said to my kids oh yeah we have to go to church because tomorrow there's no there's no school there's no work and i was i had a lot of planning for that week like we had turn this will attend the service on the 26th and we will attend the the wash the watch night service on the same week and we will attend that so i was i thought of spending the whole week in christchurch just being attending the service and fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters and i didn't want to drive on the 25th because it was saturday i said to my kids you know let's just enjoy our christmas and we'll drive early in the morning and early morning the 26th i pick up my stuff and my kid and yeah there's some sometime when the lord speaks to you you don't know that it's the lord just do things and later only realize it was the lord that taught you put that thought in your mind to do that uh on the 25th at night i went out i filled my car with petrol but when coming back i stepped out of the van and something just told me go back to the van and fasten your kids car seats and that's what i did i've my my last bone is about three and parents who have kids you know that you don't have to fasten your two years old sit the way you fast and your three-month-old baby the secret set but that day i fasted my two years old sit and my almost five years old car seat like you do for the babies like i double fastened them i don't know what i was doing that i just double fastened them and you know it was really awkward but something just taught me to do that i don't even know why and that's what what i did and i wanted to go in the house again and something just told me take the prime you know your baby is so clingy and you like you to be carrying him so you can have your pram to push him in so i put the pram in the back of the car and those two things really saved our lives i cannot say really but it helped us and through that crash so i took off to christchurch and we prayed as normal before leaving starting the car we prayed and we left so on our way to christchurch and uh i think i'm still thinking as a south africa driving in south africa i saw that they say that lowest pass road was blocked but for me i thought okay if it's blocked somewhere maybe there's a road somewhere that you can take that away and then carry on to crash it but actually i had to stop there and take another route pass by another town and get to crash it so i kept on going thinking there's another way ahead there so on somewhere there along the road and i saw the the road was blocked and there was an office i would say lady you can't carry on you have to go back where you came from and take that route and then go to christchurch so i was already you know really demoralized i was really not happy because i was i could see that i was missing the service time and it was only two hours to crush it and now i have to make a detour that will take me about three hours in so i was not in my right mind and i kept on saying why lord why only today when i'm trying to go to church really so i went back and on my way i was like okay i'll have to stop and call pastor greg and tell him you know what i may not make it to service because the road is blocked and i have to take a detour and but i kept on going because i couldn't find the stock bay and uh just to stop my kind and and and make that call so i kept going and my gps didn't like the route i took so i didn't recognize where i was going and it kept on telling me to make a detour and i kept on going i was like you need to find a way for me out there so i kept on going and somehow the gps got tired of telling me to make a u-turn it showed me a road actually it got me lost so in road that led to no way and so when i got to the road there was no signage it was really a very forgotten road as most of the south island roads are some of them not most but some of them so it was a forgotten road so i took the road and there was no enough enough signage and yeah so i didn't know that i'll just suddenly leave the ground this the sealed road and hit the shingle there were no signage nothing so i was at normal speed about 100 100 yeah as we drive we all driving the highway i think so i yeah i i left the sil road straight hit the gravel without knowing and the moment i hit the gravel i lost control i was panicking the car couldn't stay the speed was not appropriate for the gravel road so yeah a lot of things went wrong the panic and everything it's when i have the flashback it sometimes really scares me when you're sometimes watching a movie that big bang that comes in so the car just took off and started flipping i think we flipped three or four times and like rolled the car rolled and ended up in the paddock and i was unconscious i was gone so my son was 10 years old he and he was awake he tried to walk me up i was not waking up i was not opening he said to me mom you had your eyes wide open and mouth open and you were not responding and then he left the car too they they they sit the frame that i put in the back of the the car is a pram that push the pressure allow the prime to push the door the back door open and that back door the one that allowed my kids my son to go out and seek help because yeah and all the flipping that happened the car seats were just sitting there my babies were sitting there in the same place you know yeah yeah yeah so it was really yeah terrible one all the windows were broken and so my car my kid my son left and went to the main road walked up to the main road and saw some fuzz farmers passing by and asked them please come and help us we had a cat crush so they were coming back with the farmers when i regained i started regaining consciousness i had blood flipping on my head because i had concussion i had blood on my arm and so i saw when i woke up i came back to life for me it was like a big dream like i was in the dream and i was i even started praying saying oh lord this is a very bad dream don't let it happen but actually when i heard my kids at the bed crying my mama i was like oh god it's not a dream really we are in the car crash and i could look all the windows were broken so i took my car my kids out and the farmers who came they helped us live and they called the policemen the policeman was when he came he was like oh this place again we just lost somebody here at 6 30 at the same spot and it was a young man driving and i think probably also got lost and in his report he said please uh nzta please put some enough signage on this road because of this too but for me when you came he thought you would find dead bodies or maybe some people very badly injured but it was me and my three little kid looking at him and he was so amazed to see us in that state so i thank the lord i really thank the lord for that and yeah yeah i don't know what why he kept me still here but probably still have something to do with me because i would have gone home that day and yeah so i thank god for that and for all the marvelous things he has done for me being here i went through a lot of trials flooding and stuff but the lord still kept us kept us here and and well so i thank him for that and for this surprise opportunity just to testify in front of you today amen yeah okay god bless you soon amen notice we've got quite a number of south africans here so let's head for south africa we're gonna do some south african songs says [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

may you be seen this morning god as we look to you and we lord we're just waiting on you this morning bless us now in jesus name amen and amen amen amen maybe while you're standing we'll read a scripture and then we'll and then we'll greet you afterwards amen i've got um i want to read three places but it's really just four verses amen so um if you bear with me if you can just read look chapter one and then we'll go to matthew 1 and then we'll come back to luke chapter 2 amen it's just four verses i want to read praise the lord amen and then luke chapter 1 and verse 38 amen the bible says luke 1 38 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord appeared unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her amen and then we'll jump to matthew 1 but we'll come back to luke chapter 2 amen matthew 1 verse 18. and it simply says now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise now i know that sounds like a christmas message what is not a christmas messenger man amen and when when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost and let's jump back to luke chapter 2 sorry about that amen and verse 40 and then we'll jump to 52 luke chapter 2 verse 40 and then verse 52 amen verse 40 says and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him verse 52 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated in his presence this morning amen i want to greet you all this morning uh amen in the precious name of jesus christ i want our great brother pastor ben and sister christine this morning in the precious name of jesus blessed will ben and sister christine and amen and and see little boys keeping you busy amen praise the lord amen amen amen if i uh if i look at micah and seth if they anything to go by brother and brother ben we have to pray for you a man answers the christine girls are easy hey girls are easy amen oh my look at those i mean so if you see taz has got a little twitch you know why mike and said amen so i i i i got a confession to make so i enjoy when seth and michael didn't come to my home i i let him do all the things the parents don't want them to do i get great joy out of it i really do i mean always in the world right and so we've got those massive lolli jars at home we fill it hey man we let them sleep whatever time they want to go to bed and yeah and we just love what they meant so yeah we love we love the kids we love the kids but it's not so nice you can tell okay now you go home now good amen and uh and kids they just grow so quick and so fast and i mean one minute they're little ones and then now it's in our home there's six adults right myself and jenny mom and dad and the girls came and named me so they're six adults and we we can't dictate anymore we can't tell them what we want no no we get tall now mom and dad i'm an adult so uh it's it's it's a different it's different dynamics now and and as a parent you you adapt and and so the kids are you know when they get to a certain age there you know i mean they you get to teens they're hormonal and they're changing life you know what i mean and likewise we as parents do i mean we haven't been this way before right i i don't know what it's like to have you know we i mean amy amy's 23 sorry amy i mean she's 23 and i don't know we you know kim is okay 28. i mean and and so this this is my first time through this it's my i mean my first time i've never been through there before so we learned so it's as much pressure on us as parents as on the kids and sometimes i think the kids need to acknowledge that you know it's always a little appearance but sometimes kids you need to acknowledge youngsters you need to acknowledge that we're learning and we make a mess and we make we make a mess but we always have your well-being and heart you may not think that you may not thank you brother onions you may not believe that but we mean well and we i was saying the other day you know now nowadays jenny and i don't even know how to move you know my shall we do this can we do this must you know because you don't know whether you're trapping on someone's toes right you don't know you know so you you do that it's like no mommy don't daddy don't you know and we just said well adult adult you deal with adult and uh and so jenny you asked someone she said what are they what are they doing today i don't know are they going to the office i don't know i keep going to the office i don't know you know it's amy i don't know adults adults so i let adults do their thing and uh and then jenny goes to work and i i work from home speak i love that about covert and um you know and then sometimes she calls and says what are the girls doing sleeping aren't they working today i don't know adults so it's part of an adult responsibility right so if you miss a meeting that you should have had at ten o'clock not my problem you're an adult you know what i mean and you deal with it as an adult oh dad you should have worked i didn't have to wake you no ways you know you wake yourself because you said you're an adult you deal with adult you responsible for adult you can't just do it and say adult and i'll only take that part of an adult oh no oh no

amen and you know just i was um you know when i was brother ben asked me to minister and i was coming up coming i was thinking about the lord what i speak on i mean you could go to all the notes and things and this stuff i thought man maybe i'll preach last week's sunday sermon i thought ah you know certain people are going to pull me up on that and um so i i i think god's got a sense of humor and and so i was sitting with you know you toy with two white thoughts two trains of thought lord which way do you go and so tuesday night i said okay lord i prayed i said lord please brother morgan minister i said please use brother morgan to point me in the direction i said please lord and then we were sitting in church and we'd do our tears there's a zoom and then brother morgan preached oh man and he preached in the he went in the direction where i felt manual he spoke on the one of the thoughts i had and i thought oh lord thank you that's where what you want me to speak on now man god is so great ten minutes later he spoke on the second thought i had so now i said that and then he ends the sermon saying this you need to hear the voice of god so i i left the service on tuesday just as lord what are you gonna do so really i came here this morning i've got two sermons here right here and i've got the sets of quotes with both sermons and i said lord when i'm finished praying you're gonna give me direction all right i've never done that and then someone i said well maybe i should just combine the two sermons so we'll we'll see how we go this is about uh uh probably four or five hours a year i've got but i will never be that long amen and i watched my clock i did ask for the kuben what time uh and brother koben said no time and he said there's no clock at the back but i said i have my watch with me amen and that's why i've got my phone here i don't not to check textures for the time because i always say you know we a lot of people say oh brother we're living in eternity i said ah this body is still in time this body is still in time and you get a certain time and people start going home in the spirit their bodies are here and you can see look it's on your face really it's on your face believe me it's we we carry that on our faces so if i say something that offends you you'll tell yourself i'm not going to show it you'll show it serious you'll show it it's on your face right and a lot of times you look at me the minister preaches you look at me and i can see you've left i look at your face and i can see you've gone home you've left amen and so we we have to have church now with our mosques on in there because we're using a council hall and so you just see the eyes of the believers and i was telling them last week you don't know if they're smiling at you if they're grimacing at you they're frowning at you if they don't like what you're saying i say well you know but it doesn't really matter jude god told jeremiah don't look at their faces saying so i'm just happy to be here this morning amen and um i promise you i won't belong this with you this morning but as the lord leads amen so you pray for us amen but you're happy right it's good to be alive it's good to be healthy right amen with a number of things happening and you know but you know it's good but a little thought this morning i i promise you it's not a it's not a christmas message but i want to bring a thought this one if god will help us and we just see how we go and you know i i'm i'm still old school and i like tell the church i said i write out my notes and i'm old school i i watch your meetings and i see uh brother amand uses that thing and brother samson uses that thing and they got the little pointer and the and the mic over here and sorry i'm old school eh i still i still write out my notes and you know and uh that's just the way i i do stuff i like the i like the simplicity of the gospel that's my that's my revelation right i like so i i get great joy sitting down on a sand and saturday night i put together things on pieces of paper during the week and just sitting down and just putting it together now watch out god put it together i just love that you know and everyone to their own a but this morning little thought to encourage you and hopefully trust the lord will be a blessing amen we'll take it out of out of matthew 1 verse 18 and it simply says the birth of jesus christ was on this wise now i know you think brother this is christmas but you'll realize we want to try and let you know when you leave here this morning where you are in this journey because you know we're on a journey and uh and for a little inspiration i want to leave with you and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit because you see we we can't stay on one place you need to have a testimony that says brother i ain't what i was you know what i mean i'm not what i ought to be but thank god i can look back and i can see there's progress in my life i believe a christian's life is about progress a christian's walk is about you move from point a to point b you you cannot be stagnant you cannot be sitting there and say brother i got saved 20 years ago and i'm still struggling with cigarettes but you can't you can't 20 years later say i'm still struggling with dressing and i'm struggling with this and i'm no there's got to be some progress in your life because i believe god is coming for a perfect bride i believe the bride on the earth today needs to be adopted that's what i believe this morning you know and i and i see what's happening in the world and i you know and i will never ever belittle what is happening but i made a promise to god i said god i will not preach on what's happening in the world because the world brother brown says the world is in the in the end time conditions but i will say i will focus on the condition that brother branham said the bride should be and i love this quote brother branham says you always talk about how bad the world is how wicked the world is he says that's true but then he says but look how great the church is getting all the time and i said lord that's my focus anybody want to preach about russia and ukraine nothing wrong you do that but i said my call is lord i'm gonna see where the bride is because i want to say if this is the fulfillment of prophecy where should the bride be because russia and ukraine is the backdrop they the backdrop the main characters is the bride because if los angeles is ready to sink i'm not supposed to be here and in other words there's got to be a resurrection then there's got to be a 30 40 day period where brother branham visits visits well wellington assembly where the dead in christ arises when those that are dead or alive when they walk into the building and when they walk in there'll be no gray hair when they walk in there'll be no old people when they walk in brother 30 won't be bald when they walk in i'm going to be a young man because i bring the resurrection did you know what i said you bring the resurrection so we need to come into a certain condition to bring the dead out of the grave to bring brother branama to the grave if you've lost loved ones you need to get into a condition to get them out of the grave and then they're going to come walking into church is going to walk in you with that hat and he's going to take his hat off and say god bless you my brother and we're going to be young i don't know what brother honest looks like when he's a young man but i'll know him you may not know me when i had hair on my head but you'll know me oh brother prime of our youth shoulders back hey man brother branson but look how great the church is getting listen to this so when the world gets wickeder that's the brother brandon's words and weaker and wicked he says the church is getting more powerful and powerful all the time so you mean you mean you are a devil killer you mean you walk over covet you mean you trample over cancer you mean you overcome lust you mean you overcome the world you mean you victorious you mean you are more than a conqueror because brother well brother branham said that we're getting more powerful more powerful more powerful he says you always pointing how wicked the world is getting but fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time i promise god that's my focus russia will do its thing america will do its thing the purple curtain will do its thing the king of the north will do its thing and we'll do our thing that's my focus where's the bride what condition is she in what's the condition of the young people are they free are they victorious are they overcoming that's what we're after man amen and what does what does us old-timers doing brother we're fighting this good fight huh only brother onyears and brother samson said amen because they identify themselves as but brother we are i'm a right reverend we are caleb's right and may we we may look old but the bible says we are stronger than ever [Applause] caleb was in the message for 40 years he walked with a prophet message for 40 years and one day caleb got annoyed just looking at his mountain don't you sometimes feel that way don't you sometimes when you see what the enemy does to your children you just get angry i can imagine caleb came to church that morning brother ben amen and the holy ghost brother ben was behind the pulpit and caleb walked to church that morning and he said i want my mountain i wonder what is mine you see he had been looking at this mountain for 40 years he'd been wandering around this mountain for 40 years he'd been quoting the promises for 40 years but he got to a place and he said enough was enough what is that guy of destiny church they went chanting down the street enough was enough enough was enough and that's what the bride should be caleb said man and he walked up to joshua he said hey joshua i'm not asking for permission i'm not coming to ask you is it okay i just want you to know what i'm doing i want what is mine i want what is mine what is yours this morning watch your mountain oh my that's my focus the world is getting more powerful and powerful mind jesus increased in wisdom and stature oh man and this is what i'm looking at this morning a powerful church amen oh my not a wake church not we are not losers church let's try that again we are not losers god bless those are today amen but i mean we are not church because if russia is fulfilling the promises the prophecy if americans will fall in prophecy if rome is fulfilling prophecy if the world is fulfilling prophecy if second timothy 3 is being in fulfillment then where should the bride be ask yourself that question because the world is in place brother oh didn't brother branham say the minister hell i thank god i'm not a minister right thank god i'm not a minister i'm just a witness brother branham said the world am i not quoted correctly but he said the world is in the condition of the end time but he says but the ministers fail to get the people into end time conditions so ministers i don't know the ministers amen but i thank god we're just witnesses right but i believe the bride is on she's on our way and then brother brandon you see brother branham had that vision of the bride marching amen she wasn't wasting time she was marching she wasn't counting time she was marching and she was marching upwards brother oh man she wasn't singing i'm a loser she wasn't singing i'm a failure she was singing onward christian soldiers do you know you're a soldier you know sometimes we need to look at ourselves in the mirror and preach to ourselves you need to point out that guy in the mirror and say do you know you were a soldier do you know you're an overcomer do you know that greater is he that is in you than he that is have you ever preached to yourself yes you preach to yourself amen when last did you stand in front of the mirror let's be honest now let's be honest when lost did you stand in front of the mirror other than to get your hair right other than to pull your tie straight when lasted you stand in front of the mirror and preach to yourself point at that person in the mirror and say man you are more than an overcomer you should try sometimes it works point to yourself and rebuke yourself say stop being slothful stop being a weakling pull up your socks put your shoulders back lift your head in the air preach to yourself and tell yourself the word of god is stronger than ever it may not look like it it may not seem like it but the word of god can defeat satan any time under any condition the word of god that's right just preach to yourself speak to yourself amen and your rebuke tell yourself you slothful thing and after you rebuked yourself now you tell yourself the promises brother take the bible and preach to yourself man read to yourself the promises and you'll find after a while your shoulders will go back your head will go in the air because my question to you is can this word help you overcome is this word powerful enough is this word strong enough is this word great enough i say yes it is do you know what brother branham said how to overcome he said number one recognize there's a devil number one to overcome and number two he said recognize that the god in you is greater and stronger and more powerful than the force against you and then brother branson number three recognize him at his tricks recognize him at his tricks a man amen now you when your brother comes against you your brother's not the devil don't call your brother the devil when your wife upsets you don't say wife you a devil no no no no it's how you react it's how you react to the situation you know we don't want to go around calling each other devils and devils no you recognize him and then you realize he's greater he's stronger he's more powerful amen and brother behind the bible says the preaching of the cross amen the preaching of the cross and this is what we're doing this morning just reminding you of who you and are by the bible says the birth of jesus christ the bible is very specific you know the bible and nothing i can tell you to know the bible is very specific of how this event happened and i'll take you through it amen and and the visitation is very specific and if you go and you look at luke 1 verse 26 to 38 we don't have to turn there but the bible says this in the sixth month of elizabeth's pregnancy very specific the angel was sent just a little bit a little bit of background if you allow me so it was the angel gabriel that was sent the bible says when the bible says who was sent and the bible says from whom it was sent right and the bible even says to where it was sent i just love god amen he says when he says who from who and to whom my so it was the sixth month of elizabeth's pregnancy the angel gabriel came sent from god and to a city of galilee called nazareth and it carries on to a virgin named mary wow hamas to a virgin named mary engaged to joseph of the house of joseph how more specific than that can you be that with god there's no oops with god there's no maybe i'll find maybe i won't maybe what god there's nothing no no what god is six months angel gabriel god sent city of galilee oh my virgin name mary engaged to joseph specific god deals with specifics and so god when he wanted an overcomer he said man i'm going to put a name down and i'm going to put that name in a book oh my and that names will never be lost and then he said i'm gonna find them wherever they are oh my isn't that awesome amen that you are where you are because god found you god went looking for you god didn't care your family you were born in god didn't care that was all part of the plan amen god didn't care where you came from god didn't care he whether you were hindu or muslim or arabic or oh you come from tamba too oh my that didn't matter because it wasn't about this guy it's about that seed of representing [Applause] i have a question for the believers here do you believe in predestination amen i see this side does this sign you believe praise the lord so you believe that god wrote your name in the eternal book before the foundation of the world do you believe that you have representation with god from eternity do you believe that you are before the devil do you know the devil's being created but you were not you were represented in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and here you are this morning just an expression of what god had in his mind some of you don't believe that that's all right that's all right not my job to make you believe it that's brother ben's job and the minister's jobs don't mind i just preach what the word says amen that you were represented as a thought because brother branham said he said when god started the process of creation he said he believes the first thing he created was angels right he says why they needed to worship god right so they were the created but we were a thought but my bible says he chose me in him not created me he chose me in him before the devil he was created but i was before he chose me so before you messed up before you were an addict before you were what you are before your he chose you and then he said you know what and he said you know what and now i'm you're going to be born in south africa i better talk about me you're going to be born in south africa your mom's last name is going to be tabisha your dad is going to be esau what a terrible son surname i always say but that didn't matter to god god wasn't concerned about this guy we're very concerned about this guy i don't like how you look i don't like this i don't know god didn't care about this god didn't care that he took a tapasha and an esau to make this don't blame if this doesn't look appropriate blame god amen all right blame god but we're so focused on this we don't realize that behind this there's a real me so i don't care if you don't like the out of me god loves the enemy god loves the real me so god took some tavisha dust and some ease of dust and he made it to come together and he had a ferdi but inside of that furry there was a seed of representation amen and and the predestination and grace of god it was wrapped around the throne of god and then god went fishing and god knew that on the other side of the hook there was a seed and that seed was born in south africa cape town and that seed walked the world earth and that seed did his thing 16 elements but inside there was a seed a man and one day god said right time to come home somehow some of your situations are worse than mine some of you come out of a darker bestow we all mess let me start rolling and god stood there you see god like a fishing rod hey man one part was hooked of predestination was hooked it oh my god inside of you and you were just walking the earth whatever then you decided to go to uni and go to the right time to reel him in time for the boy to come home i've got a job for him he's got to pass the church he didn't know it brother ben didn't know it and if you didn't know it you brothers didn't know it and god started reeling you in and then you said i just decided to come to church this morning you liar part of the plan of god part of the you said brother my mess-ups is part of the yes it's part of the plan you said brother my mistakes oh yes he's part of the plan god didn't care and god started rolling it in brother am i oh i can pick your bed sorry for me sorry i pitched i'm picturing god sitting on a chair you know the fisherman on the side of the beach on a chair with his rod brother oh man he just started reeling it in and the angels maybe said what are you doing oh i'm just getting 30 back into his position oh hallelujah thank god just started reeling it in and andy was doing all he did as a messed up sinner and god didn't care what you doing oh i'm just reeling him in our mind the critic said i can't see andy don't worry he's on the other side of the line that's predestination he was on the other side of the line and andy oh my and then gray asked god can you see god so yeah i can see him and i can also feel him on the line oh my and as the fisherman you hold your hand on the line and the line goes over here and you can feel that tug you know what it's catchy i caught a fish once in my life or so brother best part you said with that rock brother and just feel that pull and you tell nothing to the guys around you because you're on a boater and just feel it man you just sat there and inside just got that quiet smile inside of you this is going to be a big one this is going to be a big one hey man i don't know why people go hunting that's insane man oh my the best feeling man there's a little rod you feel that little thing on there that thing on the line that line looks like a new finger and just sat there brother and he stopped playing with it oh my what you doing god i've got quintus on the other side of the line but i can't see no don't you don't have to worry i've got my trust in predestination god knows the line won't break god knows the hook won't break because it's a hook of predestination it's a line of foreknowledge it's a line of grace oh my sometimes believers we've got to put our shoulders back and he just reels you in and we mommy and daddy brothers and sister we as parents we pray for our troll and pray for you don't worry he's just something really man forgive me man i've got this verbal imagination i can see god forgive me for it making god like a human sorry god with a little fishing kept on a little piece of straw in his mouth and he says oh my and he's just whistling bring them in [Applause] what a god and he causes things to happen amen listen to sister for rich testimony he caused it he was a reeling in brother and one day brother you landed glory man you don't know how you landed you don't know what it is you landed god landed that fish brother god landed that snapper that 30-pound snapper god landed it and oh my brother ben just already landed one day don't know when it was brother ben but you landed and god took the hook out that's my fish god never questioned his hook god never questioned his gear god never questioned god knew about predestination powerful oh my i don't know where i am but praise the lord that's how specific god is that's how specific god is god said i'm going to uh hey i'm going to a city of galilee of nazareth and god said i'm sending gabriel and god said i'm going to a virgin and she's engaged to joseph oh my and when god found her he said mary you are highly favored that's how god works here my my my blessed art thou among what a what a salutation amen blessed are thou amongst women what a salutation look here the bible says mary thou art highly favored the lord is worthy blessed of thou among women wow amen what a wizard but brother i know of another visit amen says behold malachi 4 5-6 behold what an announcement i sinned who was the i god send you who's the you funny okay by the rest of you that you freddie i'm sorry i'm selfish he says i send you ferdi elijah the prophet brother that's my visitation amen oh my the angel knew your name the angel knew your name the angel knew where to find you oh my so the angel was gabriel came to mary and the angel gabriel came with the words of the prophet oh my and presented the words of the prophet to the church mary that's what the angel did amen oh my what did isaiah say a virgin shall conceive his name shall be emmanuel and to us a child is born shall call his name wonderful and counselor and mighty god and what do we say his name was jesus isaiah just said a virgin isaiah just said wonderful counselor mighty god the angel said jesus oh my what was the angel doing he took the words of the prophet and he brought it to the church the bride mary but he made made more sense to it listen what brother branham said brother branham said now watch god doesn't have to do anything more to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy when the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises the standard of it against it what does he do he makes the word that is already said more positive so here was the word of isaiah a virgin shall conceive right that was the word they needed a standard they needed a messiah year so what did the what did the angel do in the middle he took the word of isaiah that word that was already said and he made it more positive and what was it he put it in flesh that's what he did amen and so today the virgin we call her mary did isaiah call him berry did isaiah say her name was mary did isaiah say his name was jesus no oh no the angel said that so the angel picked up the word that was written brought into our day made more sense and malachi 4 wrote behold i send you elijah the prophet he took the word that had already been spoken made it more positive and today we say oh william branham but we didn't know it was william branham back then when malachi wrote it malachi just got inspired and he wrote behold i sin unto you elijah the prophet he didn't know who the you was he didn't know today we know the you was thirty am i right we didn't know back then we didn't know that that you was brother armand oh brother matt oh my we didn't know that elijah was william branham but today we do me isaiah didn't know when he said a virgin shall conceive that she'll be called mary no no what did he do the angel gabriel took what had already been said and made it more positive and today we look back and we say oh that's mary today we look back at oh that was jesus and today we look back oh that was william branham and today we look back oh that's ferdi and today we're looking so that's birdie the bride and will turn his heart why what was happening he took the word that was spoken not new word that's why brother branham was so in the bible that's why brother branham would not deviate that's why brother branham stood on the word when everybody walked away brother branham knew he had to take the word that had already been spoken and bring it into our day oh my and everybody said oh praise the lord hey remember brother but mary brother i just i love that woman mary there's something about mary hey man she said how's this thing's gonna happen here's my question for you how's the word that you believe going to become flesh glory that's my question how's your family going to be saved how's your children going to be restored amen how are you gonna have a body change when every year you're getting older and every year you're becoming more stooped and you realize today you're closer to 70 than 21. how do you realize man when you turn fifth and you realize i'm closer home than what i was when i started how is that gonna happen that you're gonna turn from an old person to a young person and the world looks at you and says man you mad you are mad mad mad to believe stuff like that but i just say leave me alone leave me alone how did father abraham know when he looked at old sister you know what sister said she laughed and wrapped in that love is all your mistakes wrapped in that laugh it's all out backsliding and failures but you see janice said she laughed hebrews 11 didn't say she lie so when they tell my life story brother when my life story is read in heaven they're not going to say ferdi did this and freddie did that and oh no no no no no they're going to say in heaven fairly stood on the word is all that's all i want to be known as brother samson you want to be known as that we stood on the word we maybe never made good decisions maybe we messed as parents maybe we made this but all you stood on the word that's what i want them to write about me oh my there's a song they said so whenever anyone ever writes my life story i want them to write in my life story that jesus is the best thing that ever happened to ferdi there's a song the gator sing and if anyone ever writes my life story i want him to say that that jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me the fact that he never walked away from me that's what blows my mind that when i messed he never walked away oh man i made some stupid moves brother in the past but he never walked away so that's my song a man i wish i could sing it that jesus is the best thing that ever happened jesus is the best thing that ever happened jesus i'm wrong the tunei is the best not just you're looking at me like brother what you're trying that's how a singer looks at the non-singer what you're trying ah it's a beautiful sister that a man oh my where was i yes the best thing that ever happened and that's grace of god oh my that he called us and he sent william branham and if you listen to william branham's life and he would listen to him preach and he said other people walked away but he said i wouldn't deviate from that word why he was taking a word that had already been spoken and written and it was bringing it into our day making more sense to it him and they said bride he said you are the bride he is they called taste but nobody wanted to talk about predestination nobody in the denominational world wants to speak about predestination my brother branham picked that up and he said that's the foundation of your walk with god that god chose you in him before the foundation of the world that he chose you amen that's predestination on my quarter 212 amen oh my i haven't started a man where were we but elijah came and he turned the hearts and malachi 4 stood on the word and he said that word is going to be real and brother branham goes along and he says not only does god come in with the learning of the word but he manifests that word and i want to let you know there's going to be a manifestation you sound like you're trying to work me up i'm not going to do that i'm too old for that i'm not going to spend my time trying to work you into a believing no i've got time for that as long as i believe you do what you want to do with the word but for us for me and my house this is where we stand brother branham took the word that had already been written and he brought into my day and he said it's yours gabriel what did gabriel do he picked up isaiah's prophecies am i right isaiah's prophecies and he brought it over into mary's day and he said mary isaiah said virgin i say mary mary isaiah said emmanuel counselor mighty god i say jesus what did he do he took the word that had already been spoken and he made it more positive and he made it more real and that's what we're doing hey man what did we know about predestination nothing but the prophet came and he picked up by his ephesians he picked up ephesians he picked up romans 8 and he said him those who have foreign he's already justified already glorified what can we say against god's elect if god is for who can be against them he picked up what had already been written and he brought it into our day what is he doing making it more positive what did he do he knew there were going to be believers that was going to believe it oh my god i never forgot about abram thank you lord for reminding me him it was abraham and sarah he didn't know how it was going to happen oh my oh my you don't know what's going to happen how am i going to become young didn't matter to abraham do you know abraham also laughed but they don't talk about abraham's laughing sarah laughed in hebrews nothing about sarah's laughing do you think you're going to get to heaven and god's going to call you one side and say all right um on a scale of one to ten how many mistakes did you make okay you made 10 mistakes okay you're going to the loser section so write you in heaven but you'll be in the loser section in heaven and then you will be in the okay you never made that many mistakes you'll be in the victor's victory section and then brother branham he was a prophet he'll be in the in the vip section thank you sister amen you think god's got segregation god is gonna look at you welcome you home not only that god said that they without us you read the book of hebrews 11 and you say lord i wish i can be like this and god goes through hebrews 11 and he gets to the losses they without ferdi they without us cannot be made perfect then he goes all along he says now you gonna bring up the resurrection you know what we are gonna meet jesus in the air [Music] he is not gonna put his foot on the earth everybody says jesus is coming jesus is coming do you know how he's coming in you do you know the only jesus this world is going to see is this person called a man from south africa thessalonians says and together we're going to meet him in the sky do you know there's going to be a meeting in the air and he only comes back with the bride when the earth is purified but he's not putting his foot on the earth and i like how everybody says oh jesus is coming jesus is coming and the world don't realize it's coming in you yeah and the world doesn't realize you are the coming of the lord i think that's a bit of a shocker there you mean jesus that got caught up in a cloud and they told their disciple don't worry the way you see him go he's coming back so you mean in 63 he was starting his descent because they said the way he went is how he's coming and everybody looked for jesus and there was jesus the carpenter's son and today everybody's looking for jesus and they don't realize there's jesus brothers he deals with artificial intelligence there's jesus that loves hunting there's jesus that does whatever you do you the pilot brother the pilot jesus flying a plane oh man amen oh man don't you realize that i don't know whether we rely believers we don't realize that that we rep we are the coming of christ today they're looking for jesus there's jesus jesus on two feet jesus saying what a mighty god is that jesus and when you become a manifestation of the word your life is going to be such a power it shakes the graves [Applause] i don't know whether you realize that believers i'm so off my message but it doesn't matter amen i don't know whether you realize that when you come to perfection you are gonna open the graves you are gonna blow my you are gonna be the one you are the one that pulls that trigger something happens in the grave the graves open your body's changed and you're gonna travel like a thought the side before we leave the air and then when we all put oh when we all come to perfection when we all become a reflection of jesus christ not going to be one day one day or not when we all amen what do they say tell me all follow ephesian tell we all come in the unity of the faith till we all come into the stature poor brother ben will have to keep preaching keep preaching keep preaching brother ben how many 99 of them are in there's that one percentage you've got to kiss brother brother ben he's got to stay at it because the bible says don't we all don't we all that includes your children that includes your loved ones that includes you so we all and you say brother but you don't know my life it's good i don't know your life doesn't matter this is my promise to you there's a hook in you there's a hook in you and jesus feels like fishing today oh my mom i'm running in my head i've got two trains of thought here i've got the fishing thought and i've got the resurrection thought i wonder brother i'm so glad brother he went fishing that day uh god help me not to forget that when was it love and when did i get baptized oh sorry i shouldn't ask you but you can't remember either oh man i think i was 12 years old not your business old i am and jesus went fishing he was fishing in the oak man i'm so i'm glad i'm here but now he says now furry you gonna bring on the resurrection my job my responsibility putin is doing what he's supposed to do ukraine is doing what they're supposed to do biden is doing what he's supposed to do and that clever

man he looked at mother sarah he said mum said are we going to be we're going to be parents sarah and sarah said hey look at us in a book that says it say don't worry sarah looked at abyss and ate my love you're getting older you're 100 years old i should say don't worry i met him i met him i fed him i killed an animal and i fed him and he told me and yes you love but he said he told me and abraham man i don't know how it happened no husbands and wives you know you wake up in the morning your wife looks at you man look at this person man getting older i'm not what i was when i got married right we're not what we were brothers when we got married right hey man when you when your precious wife fell for your brother amen let's be honest right my time has been rough on us and abram looked at sarah and sarah was stolen the 90 year old grandma and she looked at him 100 year old abe and one day they just kept fighting the good fight i just want to say church just keep fighting the good fight amen just keep fighting it's hard it's not easy so much drama so much issues so much battles but just keep fighting amen keep fighting giving up is not in you keep fighting devil trips you up keep fighting devil ankle taps you just get up and face with a mud doesn't matter just get up just get up somebody upset you just get up somebody hurt your feelings just get up they don't like you just get up church don't care about you just get up they care church cares believers care just get up amen an abraham brother one morning he woke up and abe looked at said what strange woman is this in my bed and said i looked at abe said abe said you aim i don't know what he looked like brother then but he was in the prime of his youth you say brother come be i tell you it was oh yes because little later king fell in love with her a king fell in love that had a haram of beautiful women he fell in love with a 90 year old grandma so something must have happened to their grandma something must have happened brother for that king to fall for that grammar and this is what i love about god and abraham got sarah to lie man i want to tell you god don't see your mistakes it's covered by the blood don't make them willfully abram said sarah lie and say you're my sister and abram said i'm his sister and the king was gonna marry sarah and god told the king you touched that home and you were dead this is the grace of god oh my and then god told the king you better let my lying prophet pray for you we wouldn't have done that we would have wiped that person off and said man god's done with that person get rid of that person not god god said if you don't let that prophet pray for you you finish my i gotta finish i i haven't it doesn't matter but this is where we are this morning good fighter it's a good fight and when i'm in the fight it's not a good fight when i'm out of the fight i look back at the fight awesome fight but when we're in the fight it's tough eh it's tough we we're down in auckland when life is so uncertain for us in auckland i'm not going to mention that devil's name we this sunday we plan to be in church we have to change now we're going to zoom just things are going crazy in auckland i won't let it hold us back it's a good fight it's an awesome fight i am not going to say lord send more battles i will never be that silly i remember testimony i'm going to close sorry i have to keep saying that remember remember paul paul tez was a brother in our church back in cape town brother paul and the pastor preached about god making the trials and the fire hotter and his brother got so enthused and he said lord turn up the heat was it like yet something like that turn up the heat and god took him at his word and god turned up that heat that week and gave him hell and he came back and he said he's never going to do that again i don't ask for that it will happen in its time i'm not gonna go look for problems i love living without problems i love living without issues and drama and trouble and i love living without it but god gives us grace want to be awesomer when we reach them and their bodies were changed and so the resurrection and your body change is inside of you you're feeding on your body word you feeding on your body change you saying amen this morning to your body change inside out little by little and i think brother brandon said god will slow down to god to that he said god will slow down time to see the change maybe not maybe not maybe not forget it forgive me but imagine you'll see the wrinkles go out you'll see those little things here by the eyes to see about the eyes disappear you'll see this little stuff here where they call it those crow lines laughing lines disappear you'll see the wrinkles disappear you'll see brother as the now what a day they're gonna be brother ben i don't know is god gonna do it like that out here or is it gonna come back little by little same as me brother same as long as it happens amen brother i feel the same what a what an atmosphere here this morning brother could bend it's gonna happen huh i always ask myself now lord is it gonna be like brother benzie or is it gonna be like my hair i had which wasn't too good oh i said lord what's it gonna be lord and am i gonna be i said lord am i gonna be thin am i gonna be overweight i'm gonna be six back i said lord you ask yourself those questions sometimes because to me heaven is real the body change is real so i can i answer you say brother silly no i'm sorry i have a relationship with god i can ask you that i ask him sometimes i ask him i say lord what's going to happen to my nose i ask him what's going to happen to my hair what's going to happen to my eyebrows lord i have a bushy beard and i i talked to the lord brother marin i talked to him and i like brother kubin says doesn't matter wake up one morning and there's hair on the head or or if it brings it back little by little or say lord is it going to be blonde can i ask for the color can i ask for the texture can i ask lord you think i'm silly i'm not silly i believe that because to me body change is reality heaven is real the devil is real but my god is more real and i'm fighting this good fight of faith and so i just leave me man just leave me just leave me i'm happy being a christian i'm happy being a christian i didn't preach what i was

us but my age i tell you about my threat you've got my age right we've done that all our lives it's about god's people it's not about a mic and a pulpit and being in front of the camera it's about doing whatever we can do to promote the kingdom of god that's what it is my poor girls and tesla's poor kids they've got to just fall in line with us right tesla's house is the halfway house i heard as close to the motorway yesterday brother samson said we do what we do for god's people whatever it takes we want to trample the devil and promote the kingdom that's what we're about and i've been doing this when dad started his church in 87 i think 86 in south africa i've been doing we counted the years the other day didn't we how many years have i been the footwash flunky in the church but

early yesterday we came late and brother kuben he was going to march us to the front of the church to put us make us sit right in front i had to beg him so we brother goblin says don't come late we don't come down so i respect the man i respect the man in the office he holds i respect him i mean he is i remember brother ben congratulations this is radical ben's day you're right i remember one day the last time i was here and we had a church and we were going to pray for someone after church i think we had a praise in worship or something like that was it on your anniversary when i came two years back or something like that so june or july june i came i think we're going to pray for someone it was after service the afternoon meeting and i was at the back with a shirt and i had no tie on and i was going to march to the front you know what happened right i got called in no brother you don't go up there without a tie they gave me a tie and you love people like that we're promoting the kingdom of god whatever and i want to encourage you young people i would encourage you believers whatever you can do to promote not the church promote the kingdom of god do it i see our brother brother brother brother phil has those outreach meetings in otaki man i wish i can fly down for that man i wish i could whatever we can do for god's kingdom because the devil has the young people i look at these young brothers men i'm thinking young brothers mean god can use you for the kingdom devil has these young guys the devil has the almost said michael jackson's he's dead right the justin bieber and i don't know all the other guys the devil has these guys god is looking for young men and young sisters that can shape the kingdom of god that's what god's looking for because young people relate to young people i mean i'm my age and i still help out with the young people men the young people i can't relate to to 12 14 15 year olds what do they want to know about me what can i teach them about those social media and things like that right young people relate to young people brother marion the kingdom needs you my young brother i forgot your name the kingdom needs you david young brothers the kingdom needs you young sisters the kingdom of god needs you they need davids they need daniels they need they need mary's they need sarah's they need hannah's they need the kingdom needs young people to shake this wellington to let them know there's a god that's what wellington needs [Applause] [Music] that's what wellington needs yes wellington needs the kubens and the heads and the samsons and the brother hazelden yes wellington needs those two but wellington also needs the younger ones otaki needs the seniors here but otaku also needs the younger ones man because you know why now the devil can't say i've got them all he can't the devil can't say i've got all the young people he can't because he doesn't have all the young people he doesn't have all the mommies he doesn't have all the daddies he doesn't have all the girls he doesn't have all the boys because of all of you sitting here this morning so my encouragement to you this morning is keep the faith i'm sorry i didn't finish what i was going to say i didn't even go there but we'll leave it at that to man keep fighting the good fight keep pressing the battle it ain't easy but it's worth it it means that the whining song that the whiner's woman sings it wasn't easy but it was worth it amen wasn't easy but it's worth it hey man so i want to encourage you put your shoulders back yeah we got problems yeah we got issues yeah we got dramas but put your shoulders back lift your head when you go home this afternoon go have church with yourself in the mirror and talk to yourself tell yourself about the
