[29:21] Lord willing we'll hear from Taranaki a
[29:22] bit more on Sunday as well anyway I mean
[29:26] by trust you enjoyed the service on
[29:27] Sunday I listened to it then and and I
[29:29] just had a great time so I mean that was
[29:32] glorious so let's just go let's go to
[29:34] the scripture let's go I want to try and
[29:36] tie these things together but we want to
[29:37] go to Genesis chapter 5 and verse verse
[29:40] 21
[29:41] I mean components of the bride in the
[29:47] scripture I mean I yeah I I enjoyed
[29:50] Sunday that was that was glorious you
[29:52] know amen
[29:54] thank you for your praise for us as well
[29:57] we we made it home in one piece we had a
[29:59] good time away and so thank you very
[30:01] much appreciate that I mean it's got a
[30:03] Genesis 5 and I'm going to read verses
[30:06] 21 to 23 and then yeah we're just going
[30:11] to read here and Genesis 5 21 to 23 and
[30:15] just keep your Bibles handy just as we
[30:16] go along it says an enoch lived sixty
[30:19] and five years and begat methuselah and
[30:22] enoch walked with god after he begat
[30:24] methuselah three hundred years and begat
[30:26] sons and daughters
[30:27] and all the days of Enoch were 360 in
[30:30] five years and Enoch walked with God and
[30:32] was not for God took him what a
[30:35] testimony Amen may the Lord bless his
[30:37] word you may have your seats this
[30:39] morning I mean I mean this night so what
[30:41] do I want to speak about I want to well
[30:43] I'm gonna go more into Moses but I want
[30:45] to continue I thought about seeing the
[30:47] two spirits within the framework of the
[30:49] church and and we know that you know II
[30:52] not care here's here's the seventh from
[30:55] Adam errs as a spoken of in Jude and we
[30:59] understand that we out of the seventh
[31:01] church age a bride is called to be
[31:02] translated to to walk from this world to
[31:05] the next world so we know Enoch Enoch
[31:07] was a was a prophecy or a type of you
[31:10] where people would walk with God and
[31:13] would be knocked because God took them
[31:15] so he didn't walk with anything else but
[31:16] he walked with God now Enoch had a head
[31:20] of ministry if we just go to Jude well
[31:22] the book of Jude it's what he knows that
[31:25] that that Enoch had a ministry you know
[31:27] many times well I used to think you know
[31:29] Enoch when I think about him maybe I've
[31:31] been reading too many children's Bibles
[31:32] but it's like a perfect blue day
[31:34] a blue squad day every day of his life
[31:36] everything goes fine he just walks with
[31:38] God and goes home you know but but we're
[31:40] gonna understand that you know that's
[31:43] not the case
[31:44] amen but wouldn't that be lovely but you
[31:46] know we have to overcome I mean we're
[31:48] good at yo God wants to prove his
[31:50] salvation in this day and he's going to
[31:52] prove it in your life
[31:53] Amen so in order to prove the power of
[31:55] the blood to prove the power of his word
[31:56] you would have come against some enemies
[31:58] amen but ultimately you know there's got
[32:01] to be there's going to be a faith and
[32:03] it's already been released to the church
[32:04] through the entire message a translation
[32:06] faith I'm in a rapture in faith that's
[32:08] already been spoken in this age and we
[32:11] have been predestinated ordained to
[32:13] receive that faith and to take a rapture
[32:16] I mean so we only read three verses but
[32:18] that but but those three verses we read
[32:20] in Genesis 5 speaks of your entire life
[32:22] because Enoch didn't walk with God 365
[32:26] years he walked with God after 65 years
[32:28] so there's a time of his life he didn't
[32:31] walk with God but then one day God
[32:32] intersected his path at a predestinated
[32:35] moment then he began to walk with God
[32:37] and it's the same thing I don't know
[32:39] what he walked with before that time it
[32:41] doesn't matter the fact as he walked
[32:43] with God you know some people but they
[32:45] may even just walk with God one day and
[32:47] God takes them home but as long as they
[32:49] walked with God they fulfilled their
[32:51] portion of the word that's all that
[32:52] matters I mean so that's what we want to
[32:55] do you know we are predestinated people
[32:57] I mean and we're not predestined unto
[32:59] condemnation as brother Adrian touched
[33:02] on but we are predestined unto glory and
[33:05] to a rapture amen so now now we read
[33:08] here in Jude now Judas the last last um
[33:11] you know book before revelation and and
[33:14] entity speak about to earnestly contend
[33:16] to them for the faith that's once
[33:17] delivered to the Saints and he begins to
[33:19] speak about men who have crept in
[33:21] unawares yo this Antichrist spirits come
[33:23] among them but let's just go - let's
[33:26] just go I'm just gonna go from verse 10
[33:28] but they speak evil of those things
[33:31] which they know not so speaking about
[33:34] antic religious people but they only can
[33:37] lis understand something they do not
[33:39] know the word by revelation but they
[33:42] know naturally as brute beasts and those
[33:44] things they corrupt themselves woe unto
[33:47] them they have gone
[33:48] the way of Cain now we know Cain
[33:49] rejected God's provide away he wouldn't
[33:51] accept the blood he tried to offer his
[33:54] own religion I'm just touching these
[33:55] things very briefly and he killed Abel
[33:58] the true worshipper and ran greedily
[34:01] after the error of Balaam we know Balaam
[34:03] zero as he as he caused he caused
[34:06] Israel to mix with my weapon and in
[34:08] fornication adultery take on their
[34:11] worship and stop them journeying from
[34:14] Egypt to the promised land now an
[34:16] antichrist spirit will always stop you
[34:18] trying to take your inheritance they'll
[34:20] always try and stop you wherever you are
[34:22] in your walk you may be in Egypt will
[34:24] try and stop you in Egypt you may have
[34:26] crossed the red seal try and stop you in
[34:28] the wilderness and it won't just try and
[34:29] stop you there it will even try and stop
[34:31] you when you've crossed over Jordan and
[34:33] will contend with you every step of the
[34:36] journey but you've got to have
[34:38] confidence when God said I give you the
[34:40] land I give you the full inheritance I
[34:42] mean it's yours hallelujah your
[34:44] footsteps of possession you ever going
[34:46] to go
[34:46] don't claim it right but the devil will
[34:49] try and stop you in every part of your
[34:51] walk even before you say yes Lord I'll
[34:53] serve you the devil's it a try to stop
[34:55] you
[34:56] amen you say well that's that's kind of
[34:59] annoying this devil's here to fight me
[35:00] yeah but we have the victory
[35:02] amen and and how can we be more than
[35:05] conquerors if there's nothing there to
[35:07] conquer right so there's got to be a war
[35:11] there's got to be a fight and we got to
[35:13] have some fight you know we were
[35:16] churning up to town where we stopped at
[35:18] the wire uu Army Museum and and it was
[35:21] quite neat to see you know New
[35:22] Zealanders all the way from even the
[35:24] first Boer War to Afghanistan and we
[35:27] never or first the Second World War
[35:29] that said that they were you know they
[35:30] always rose to the challenge and they
[35:33] were actually very excellent soldiers
[35:34] you know they you know general Rommel
[35:37] who was the he was a great general in
[35:40] the and the and the Nazi regime in World
[35:42] War two he said words this effect that
[35:45] if he had adjust a few battalions of New
[35:47] Zealand soldiers he could conquer the
[35:48] world
[35:49] so we appear to be laid back but when
[35:52] the challenge comes we raise to the
[35:53] challenge now that's just naturally how
[35:55] much more spiritually I mean so we
[35:57] appear laid back now we know we're not
[35:59] New Zealanders we're from heaven
[36:01] we just happen to live here right but I
[36:04] think that's the same thing you know the
[36:06] bride when the challenge we are
[36:07] laid-back because we're at rest God is
[36:09] doing everything but when the devil cot
[36:11] comes on our turf boy he's got a fight
[36:13] on his hands and he mouths oh just run
[36:15] because he's going to get whipped he's
[36:17] being whipped for thousands of years is
[36:19] going to get what plum more time holiest
[36:21] or whatever the end of it remember when
[36:22] the enemy comes in like a flood I'll
[36:24] raise up a standard and the standard is
[36:26] the anointed word and you Amen rising to
[36:29] conquer the fire of the enemy amen
[36:31] because the the revelation we have of
[36:34] who we are is prevailing against aim in
[36:36] the lies of the devil I mean that's why
[36:38] there's such a fight the devil says
[36:40] you're not a Christian you're not a
[36:41] believer you're not the bride you think
[36:43] you're this and that in that and you
[36:44] were to say well as brother agent said
[36:46] this is my marriage certificate this is
[36:48] my documentation hallelujah Amen
[36:52] hallelujah so Balaam tried to stop them
[36:56] there and there perished in the
[36:58] gainsaying of korah which is yeah Korah
[37:01] and that gainsaying and in the Greek
[37:04] I've got my major means against the word
[37:06] so a person being against the word being
[37:09] Antichrist of course how did he tried to
[37:11] make me rise up against Moses's
[37:13] leadership because God ordained Moses to
[37:15] take the people into the land but these
[37:17] men rose up thinking they were something
[37:19] and they tried to stop Israel going into
[37:22] the Promised Land and and Moses just
[37:25] said well if God do a new thing and he
[37:27] swallows you up well you'll see whose
[37:28] side is on whose side and the earth
[37:30] swallowed them up so the world swallowed
[37:33] these people up and you see people rise
[37:35] up trying to try to take away the power
[37:37] of the blood saying well we could just
[37:39] be Christians but we don't need to
[37:40] change we don't need to surrender we can
[37:42] do whatever we want what happens is they
[37:43] separate themselves having not the
[37:45] spirit and the earth the world swallows
[37:47] them up amen
[37:50] it's happened all the way down through
[37:51] the scripture it will keep happening
[37:53] maybe because spirits do not die so
[37:56] history repeats itself that's why you've
[37:59] got to see the spirit in you what is it
[38:01] motivating you to do is it motivating
[38:04] you to walk closer with God you want
[38:06] more of them or is it motivating you
[38:08] just to let go turn and and your
[38:11] fictions are on something else you know
[38:13] people
[38:14] felice sir into brother Bram says a
[38:16] statement he says if you want to be if
[38:17] you want to be a Christian be a total
[38:19] Christian you know he even says if
[38:22] you're gonna be a bumpy the best bum you
[38:24] can be I mean if you're gonna be
[38:26] something be the best so if you're gonna
[38:28] be a believer be the best believe
[38:30] you can be don't be wishy-washy inside
[38:32] outside that are if you're gonna be a
[38:33] Christian be a Christian I mean because
[38:37] it's the thing that stumbles people is
[38:39] religious people that's the greatest
[38:41] stumbling block the devil can put in
[38:43] front of other believers as other
[38:45] religious people and we'll come to that
[38:47] because that's what the devil tried to
[38:49] do in Egypt to stop the people one
[38:52] applying the blood in order to leave it
[38:54] an exodus so he says these are spots in
[39:00] your feasts of charity these are spots
[39:03] in your love feasts so these ones gather
[39:06] around they feed on the word they
[39:08] worship they rejoice but they're not the
[39:11] real deal remember I said Legion came
[39:15] and worship Jesus but it was the demons
[39:18] in him worshipping remember we read that
[39:21] weren't we so people can shout they can
[39:22] jump they can cry they can run around
[39:24] and scream but it's actually demon
[39:26] spirits worshiping God well it's very
[39:29] easy to see with Legion because he was
[39:31] naked in the tombs you could tell man
[39:33] this guy's not in his right mind right
[39:35] but then you but then it comes down to
[39:36] the you know it comes down brother and
[39:38] sister the thin edge of the wedge in
[39:39] this day this is the thin edge of the
[39:41] wedge where people can look right act
[39:44] right but not have the life just like
[39:46] brother Adrian put that quote up how
[39:48] those parents came to brother Brown said
[39:50] their son you know he wouldn't apologize
[39:52] that girl he was going with and he
[39:54] talked about their natural lineage and
[39:56] and how how but but the father was so
[39:59] convinced I know my son has come to
[40:01] Christ but he was not converted yet
[40:03] outwardly he went through the emotion of
[40:05] being a believer but he wasn't changed
[40:07] now what is that that is a Caine spirit
[40:10] trying to stop a person come to a birth
[40:12] because we must recognize what you once
[40:15] were should not be what you are now
[40:18] right sure we have a personality you
[40:20] know I will still be this kind of way
[40:22] but my unconverted self should be very
[40:25] different to my convert itself if you
[40:27] saw me how I
[40:28] as you'd say there is I trust a big
[40:30] contrast in me from into now but if I'm
[40:34] they're still the same old person but
[40:35] you're quoting scripture and quoting the
[40:36] message something hasn't happened yet I
[40:39] meant so we don't just want to be
[40:42] talking about being a believer but we
[40:43] want to be a believer where God has
[40:46] transformed us now sure above you but
[40:48] you know it's a process yeah maturity is
[40:51] a process but there's got to be a birth
[40:53] it's got to be something you don't just
[40:55] walk into this with age you meet him
[41:01] amen so these are spots in your feasts
[41:03] of charity now I'm just reading
[41:05] Scripture so I'm not I'm not throwing
[41:06] any javelins at anyone when they feast
[41:09] with you feeding themselves without fear
[41:11] without reference without godly fear
[41:12] clouds they are without water what's
[41:14] that a cloud without water has no
[41:16] substance got the nourishment and can't
[41:18] water the earth it can't it can't feed
[41:20] the ground it's just something that just
[41:21] blocks the sunlight we don't want
[41:24] nothing to block our sunlight right
[41:29] carried about of winds every wind of
[41:33] doctrine blows people around you
[41:34] whatever stabilizer in your life amen
[41:37] when you know if you're built upon the
[41:39] rock of Revelation nothing will move you
[41:41] things will try and move you I mean but
[41:43] when the devil comes in with with half
[41:45] courts and half Scripture and thinks
[41:46] there should be something in you saying
[41:48] hold on something doesn't something's
[41:51] not clicking this should be that alarm
[41:54] bell member my sheep know my voice you
[41:56] know and and a shepherd the real ship
[41:59] and a fake ship it can can't call the
[42:01] same name they can give the same
[42:02] instructions but then the ship will say
[42:04] no that doesn't sound like my Shepherd I
[42:06] mean but if you don't know the Word of
[42:08] God right if he and if you don't know
[42:11] the author of the word then a false
[42:14] shepherds voice will mislead you but if
[42:17] you know his voice through something and
[42:19] you say hold on this is not right that's
[42:21] why we know in reality there's no black
[42:24] gray and white the gray area is actually
[42:28] where there's no discernment to make a
[42:29] black or white I mean stuff this well
[42:31] I'm not sure about this you should pray
[42:33] about and say Lord show me what the
[42:35] black and white is in this gray area
[42:36] because it can look so nice it can seem
[42:39] so right but hold on
[42:42] and the Lord will show you in his word
[42:43] somewhere yes or no amen trees whose
[42:50] fruit withereth without fruit not
[42:54] producing the fruit of the Spirit amen
[42:57] twice dead plucked up by the roots
[42:58] raging waves of the sea foaming about
[43:01] their own shame wandering stars of whom
[43:04] is reserved the blackness of darkness
[43:06] forever and Enoch also the seventh from
[43:09] Adam prophesied of these so we just read
[43:12] about he spoke about under inspiration
[43:14] he prophesied these ones would come so
[43:17] he had a ministry behold the Lord cometh
[43:19] with ten thousands of his Saints to
[43:20] execute judgment upon all to convince
[43:23] all that are ungodly among them of all
[43:25] their ungodly deeds which they have
[43:26] ungodly committed and all of their and
[43:30] all of their hard speeches with ungodly
[43:33] sinners have spoken against him these
[43:36] are murmurers complainers walking after
[43:38] their own lusts and their flesh mouth
[43:40] speaketh great swelling words having
[43:42] men's persons in admiration because of
[43:45] advantage that is a lot of that but I'm
[43:47] just gonna leave it there buddy see he
[43:48] had a ministry so he prophesied of these
[43:51] so what is these the things we just
[43:53] spoke about and all of those spirits we
[43:56] just identified as to stop a people
[43:58] translating going from this world to the
[44:02] next world now Paul would write to
[44:07] timothy if we go to 2nd Timothy 3 I'm
[44:09] just gonna basically we're just gonna
[44:12] hit some highlights and then maybe we'll
[44:14] do some borrowing another time but you
[44:16] know I just want to give you these
[44:17] things because your God has fully
[44:19] equipped us to identify the Antichrist
[44:22] spirit and to withstand him not a person
[44:26] just like when brother bayon speaks
[44:27] against denomination he says no it's not
[44:29] the people it's the system because the
[44:31] system holds the people back there's
[44:33] good people in those systems and it
[44:35] still is right but it's the spirit it's
[44:37] a system it's not the people
[44:42] that's why Lord Jesus help us with
[44:45] wisdom as wise as serpents but harmless
[44:48] as doves help us our heart should be
[44:50] redemption right our whole life should
[44:53] be Lord I want to see someone meet you
[44:54] on a seesaw
[44:55] on being redeemed I want to see I want
[44:57] to see the power of the blood come upon
[44:59] them that same God I met I want them to
[45:01] meet that should be our houses I every
[45:04] where we go even if they don't you know
[45:06] what I read in the family ultra volume I
[45:07] think as one this morning of brother BAM
[45:09] says about some some believer said lord
[45:12] help me to speak but but give me a nod
[45:15] when I've said too much or give me a
[45:17] nudge when I've said too much
[45:18] so basically help me to speak to them
[45:20] but when but when that signal comes -
[45:22] hold on stop help me to be led by that
[45:24] because someone's to be above an opening
[45:26] and then no sometimes no opening than no
[45:28] sometimes a big opening there comes that
[45:30] you know you need wisdom when to speak
[45:31] to people but he'll guide us you know we
[45:33] just need to relax and let him have his
[45:35] way you know it's not we have this kind
[45:37] of pre-planned speech and you know kind
[45:39] of like a big like a pathway diagram
[45:41] talk about this yes or no speak about
[45:44] this yes or no this yes or no it's not
[45:45] about that don't just be led just let
[45:48] the Lord lead you amen hey if he lead
[45:51] all the prophets all the believers all
[45:52] the way down through do you think he do
[45:54] you think now I've got too hard to lead
[45:56] people that we're still the same people
[45:59] they mean second Timothy 3:1 notice also
[46:03] than the last days perilous times shall
[46:05] come now we understand in the scripture
[46:07] that a day a day upon the earth as a as
[46:10] a thousand years and and that when one
[46:13] thousand years is a day with God so in
[46:15] these last day in the last days plural
[46:18] mm two days two thousand years perilous
[46:21] times shall come we are living in
[46:22] perilous times for men shall be lovers
[46:25] of their own selves this is the age of
[46:27] the selfie why people are broadcasting
[46:30] themselves that's why I see many YouTube
[46:32] influences they get suicidal and
[46:34] depressed because they're trying to
[46:35] project themselves it's all about them
[46:37] and the more you try and push about
[46:39] yourself the more downward and depressed
[46:41] you'll become why cuz we're not built to
[46:43] focus upon ourselves we're actually
[46:45] built to help others amen
[46:48] life is not one big self vanity project
[46:51] it's actually we're here for one another
[46:54] that's all you know people sing that
[46:57] song it's all about you it's all about
[46:58] YOU Jesus I'm going back to the heart of
[47:00] worship well a lot of people actually
[47:02] sing it's all about me it's all about me
[47:03] Jesus it's all about him I didn't get
[47:07] that mixed up there is a song I'm going
[47:08] to
[47:08] to the heart of worship who knows it
[47:09] it's all about you well that's his word
[47:12] if it's all about him anyway lovers of
[47:15] their own selves covetous for a few
[47:18] people are satisfied with what they have
[47:19] in this day you want to read today's
[47:21] news oh this is the news right we don't
[47:24] want to be under this spook because this
[47:25] is an anointing right we are influenced
[47:28] by two powers God or Satan your choice
[47:31] your free male choice to be who's gonna
[47:33] guide you right covetous boasters this
[47:38] is the age of look how awesome I am
[47:40] proud and and pity party having a pity
[47:44] party's pride as well it's all about
[47:45] look about me look at what I'm going
[47:47] through look at this look at this no you
[47:48] got to take your eyes off what you're
[47:50] going through and look at the Word of
[47:51] God I mean but David in his great trial
[47:54] when his men consented to stone him when
[47:55] he lost all of his children and his
[47:57] wives and they lost everything at zyg
[47:59] leg he encouraged himself in the Lord he
[48:02] didn't say well poor poor as me well was
[48:04] me God look God United me to be Kingdom
[48:07] I mean want to kill me look how you
[48:08] gonna get me out of this mess no he
[48:10] encouraged himself in the Lord and
[48:12] that's how we got out of that and it's
[48:14] always through a time of transition when
[48:16] crisis hits because remember when he was
[48:19] a zigg leg saul has been taken out of
[48:21] the way the one obstacle that stopped
[48:23] him taking the throne was being taken
[48:25] out the way by God and during that time
[48:27] of transition this is where David lost
[48:29] all and we're going from this world to
[48:32] the next world
[48:33] amen our Lord Jesus go from son of man
[48:36] to son of David in the Millennium it's a
[48:37] transition our sin this transition out
[48:40] there has to be a loss but there has to
[48:41] be a a receiver getting back a redeeming
[48:44] of everything that's been taken amen
[48:47] that's why it doesn't matter what the
[48:50] devil is taken from you there will come
[48:51] a day and I believe now is we will get
[48:53] it back I mean where you have had to
[48:55] have god-given rights God it's my
[48:57] property Satan take your hands off God's
[48:59] property doesn't matter who does what it
[49:01] is
[49:02] give it back in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:03] and he recovered all that failed I
[49:06] believe we shall recover all that fail
[49:08] as well you ever think that person is
[49:10] not savable they've gone too far they've
[49:11] done too much who said I'm not God he's
[49:16] the righteous judge
[49:18] amen if Jesus could hang between heavens
[49:22] and earth on the cross and say Father
[49:23] forgive them they don't know what they
[49:24] do they saying Lord don't condemn them
[49:27] because of what they're doing give them
[49:28] another chance even Stephen said lord
[49:32] lay not the son of their charges they
[49:33] were stoning him that was Christ on
[49:36] display to be like Jesus we want to be
[49:39] like him amen
[49:43] without blasphemers no boasters proud
[49:47] blasphemers disobedient to parents don't
[49:51] let that anointing come upon you that's
[49:53] the first law of promises Oh children
[49:56] obey your parents in the Lord for this
[49:57] is right that's the first commandment
[49:59] with promise so you want the Lord to
[50:01] bless your life you want to serve God
[50:03] obey your parents because as you obey
[50:05] your parents you're serving God amen you
[50:09] know there there may be great battles
[50:11] raging in your family well then how do
[50:12] you actually win those battles serve
[50:14] your parents David was serving his
[50:17] father when his father said take take
[50:19] this food down to your brothers in the
[50:21] battle and he went down there Israel and
[50:24] and the Philistines are on either side
[50:26] of the valley Goliath came out made us
[50:28] both bring me a man bring me a man and
[50:30] here's a little boy who's just serving
[50:33] his dad operating in the body and this
[50:35] Devils making a boast he just says who's
[50:37] this uncircumcised Philistine you know
[50:40] and and and his brothers who just say to
[50:42] him you're just being naughty David go
[50:44] away you just want to see the battle
[50:45] he's serving in the body and the Devils
[50:49] on Ana's ground right and he takes that
[50:52] Goliath down amen we want to you know
[50:59] don't be just you know you say well my
[51:01] parents are old-fashioned dirty litter
[51:02] we the same Devils you fighting we have
[51:07] already fought them you may not believe
[51:10] that but it's happened they don't
[51:14] understand me
[51:15] oh yes we do but maybe sometimes we're
[51:18] gonna sit them down and say I was right
[51:20] where you were amen hey I was whatever
[51:26] age you are younger than me once
[51:29] believe it or not anyway without natural
[51:33] affection see people have no natural
[51:36] fiction towards family no loyalty
[51:38] towards anyone these days there's dog
[51:40] eat dog don't this anointing fall upon
[51:42] you
[51:43] trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
[51:46] fierce despisers of those that are good
[51:50] you know but jesus said won't you if all
[51:53] men speak good of you he said you
[51:55] actually you're actually in a bad state
[51:57] if everyone thinks you're awesome you
[51:59] know the biggest curt you you know the
[52:01] biggest problem brother man speaks there
[52:02] are three things that can that can doubt
[52:04] a minister and I'll say it's anyone
[52:06] money woman and popularity
[52:08] it's the popularity that's actually the
[52:11] most subtle dangerous one because people
[52:14] tribe I'll just be popular with these
[52:15] people of your influence with these
[52:16] people that I can do this
[52:18] now hold on we don't want to be I'm not
[52:21] this is not a popularity contest if this
[52:24] was a popularity contest
[52:26] this place wouldn't exist amen
[52:29] we would find the biggest church with
[52:31] the biggest one ever whatever would do
[52:32] what they do but we're gonna follow the
[52:33] Word of God I mean so it's not whatever
[52:36] no because remember a group of people yo
[52:40] the majority is not correct you say what
[52:44] do you mean we're educated we're smart
[52:46] Nazi Germany was smart too and they all
[52:49] swung under what Hitler was preaching
[52:51] those demon powers of being released on
[52:53] his words they came under that anointing
[52:55] and they and they massacred the Jews and
[52:57] all the gypsies and whoever else that
[52:59] they'd and all the undesirables educated
[53:02] nation so it's not majority is correct
[53:06] it's those that stand with God a correct
[53:09] but you take Micaiah there you know
[53:12] there's there's a habit I believe
[53:13] Jehoshaphat Jobs got 400 prophets Azrael
[53:17] Israeli prophets and they're about to go
[53:20] fight the battle and Ahab says you know
[53:22] we'll just get our prophets to prophesy
[53:24] they'll tell us which way to go and all
[53:26] they see with one Accord go up fight
[53:28] you'll win even the leader made some
[53:31] horns he got all the real charismatic
[53:33] and exciting until you work with these
[53:34] you'll push them out of the country of
[53:36] the enemy but the enjoy Haase Fett was a
[53:39] little bit kind of young here he had a
[53:41] bit more religion than
[53:42] have did hey she doesn't not one more
[53:45] who knows the story brother and place
[53:46] himself right in there and actually
[53:48] that's the bride's portion he actually
[53:51] where the bride is living out that
[53:53] scripture because it's not Elijah there
[53:56] Elijah's gone off the scene now he's
[53:59] another one standing by himself and they
[54:02] go get my car a hab sits at your house
[54:04] about are you there's one more but I
[54:05] hate him he always preaches against me
[54:07] he always balls me out tells me when I'm
[54:09] wrong Crick's me by the word you know he
[54:11] sees all these things and you know but
[54:13] John service is I don't need the King
[54:14] say so let's go get him so so some men
[54:17] go and get micaiah and they say don't
[54:19] dharmakaya you want her fellowship begin
[54:21] you want to be you're gonna be accepted
[54:23] you want to be popular again just say
[54:25] what we say this is what we've said this
[54:28] is how the meetings been going
[54:29] everyone's been sharing rejoicing has
[54:30] been wonderful revelation but McCoy says
[54:32] I only say what God put in my mouth he
[54:34] wasn't willing to be bad bye-bye bye-bye
[54:37] the pressure of a of a group hallelujah
[54:41] I believe I'm looking at some more cars
[54:43] here
[54:44] amen and then he and then he prayed and
[54:46] he saw a vision of Israel scattered on
[54:49] the yo on the hills without a shepherd
[54:51] and then he saw a big yo but but then
[54:55] the head prophet said you know when did
[54:57] the Spirit of God leave me and God you
[54:59] and he yo he slept him in the face and
[55:01] then Mike I said no I saw a lying spirit
[55:04] I saw a council up in heaven remember
[55:06] this word should connect us with what's
[55:08] going up on and him he said I saw I
[55:10] serve counsel up in heaven God sitting
[55:12] on a throne saying what can I do who can
[55:14] I see it because they had to fulfill
[55:16] what can I do to cause Elijah's prophecy
[55:19] to be fulfilled upon the earth and the
[55:21] lying spirit comes up from Hell says
[55:23] I'll go they'll believe me why will they
[55:26] believe him because they don't know the
[55:27] word they did not acknowledge the
[55:30] prophecy of Elijah right you see this
[55:33] world even now the Christian world
[55:36] thinks it's gonna all unite together and
[55:38] going to Christianize the world
[55:39] we're gonna bring everyone to get these
[55:41] to be great harmony but Elijah has stood
[55:43] on this day and says Jezebel is gonna be
[55:46] destroyed by a bomb and Ahab's going to
[55:48] be killed as well Russia will destroy
[55:50] both that's the prophecy of Elijah right
[55:54] so the vision that
[55:56] I received matched the prophecy of
[55:57] Elijah so he knew it was correct
[56:00] that's why we've got to look back into
[56:02] the message and say you know what was
[56:04] prophesied of this day and then we can
[56:07] see now the inspiration that comes upon
[56:09] us does that match the inspiration of
[56:10] the message or does it not because if it
[56:12] doesn't match the inspiration of the
[56:14] message it's a wrong spirit amen
[56:18] Yvonne singing I've got to listen to the
[56:20] message I've got to read my Bible more
[56:21] you do it's daily food kids about you
[56:25] know people get caught up Annie you know
[56:27] in Iran and and what Trump's doing it
[56:30] says in the book of Revelation God puts
[56:32] it in the hearts of men to fulfill his
[56:34] word right so don't be focused on what's
[56:36] going on over there look at where God is
[56:39] bringing you in your inheritance right
[56:42] where God is bringing you and your walk
[56:44] remember Enoch walked with God and he
[56:47] was not for God took him that's how
[56:51] we're gonna be I mean so so micaiah
[56:55] compared his version with the largest
[56:57] prophecy and it proved to be correct and
[57:00] he didn't he didn't bow because there
[57:03] was 400 prophets saying something
[57:04] different or the kings were there he
[57:06] said no this is what's going to happen
[57:08] because you have indicated prophet have
[57:10] been in the land and he spoke certain
[57:11] things we have to be the same way now
[57:14] we're worried this bunch right you're
[57:16] having a form of godliness but denying
[57:18] the power there are from such turn away
[57:21] now the power of God is not initially
[57:25] healing remember by His stripes we were
[57:29] healed so it's not even a miracle when
[57:31] people get healed because they're being
[57:32] paid for people all given faith to
[57:34] receive it it's already happen see see
[57:37] healing when we asked for healing it's
[57:39] actually Lord thank you you've already
[57:40] done it I've come to claim it that's not
[57:42] Lord can you heal me he has already
[57:44] healed you it's like it's not Lord can
[57:46] you save me he already has you have to
[57:47] accept it
[57:48] right but if you don't my brother I'm
[57:50] saying Jesus could be standing right
[57:51] here right now but he can't heal you
[57:53] because he's already healed you right he
[57:54] already saved you that down Calvary I
[57:56] mean you just have to accept it
[57:59] hallelujah are you glad that's here you
[58:02] just got to accept it say yes Lord I
[58:03] accept it
[58:05] amen so but the power of God denying the
[58:08] power of what
[58:09] that power to transformer people that
[58:11] the wood becomes manifested in them and
[58:13] its fullness a meant for the sort are
[58:18] they which creep into houses and lead
[58:20] silly woman women captive later with
[58:22] sins lead away with diverse lusts ever
[58:24] learning and never able to come to the
[58:27] knowledge of the truth
[58:28] now as Jenison Jambres withstood Moses
[58:31] so do these also resist the truth men of
[58:34] crop Minds reprobate concerning the
[58:38] faith but they shall proceed no further
[58:40] for their folly shall be manifested unto
[58:42] all men as this also was now jettisoned
[58:48] generous we understand were the
[58:51] magicians in pharaoh's court now just
[58:55] like brother Adrian said on Sunday Moses
[58:58] was the first Exodus prophet we know
[58:59] brother and preach a sermon the third
[59:01] Exodus and we were under the third
[59:03] Exodus now so now if a Exodus prophet
[59:07] comes he's going to take you from
[59:09] someplace didn't take you to another
[59:11] place but the thing is these two men
[59:15] here were working miracles in Egypt to
[59:19] stop the people trying to so they had in
[59:22] the heart of Pharaoh and it confused the
[59:25] people in order that they would not
[59:28] apply the blood and go in an exodus that
[59:31] was their job now brother branham he was
[59:35] the initiator history tells us and this
[59:37] is not even pro there's not even message
[59:40] believers it's just historians
[59:41] Pentecostal historians and even not even
[59:43] Pentecostal ones they said brother
[59:45] Branham has healing Revati initiated the
[59:49] post-world War two healing revival so he
[59:51] came with the two science I mean the
[59:54] angel Lord came down people knew the
[59:56] angel was there he had a ministry that
[59:59] eclipsed everything else but then what
[1:00:01] happened is there was other people said
[1:00:02] I can do that too and they imitate it
[1:00:04] some could some say they could smell
[1:00:07] demons others said they could yo you
[1:00:08] know that you know they tried to
[1:00:09] impersonate the gift in the hand or you
[1:00:11] know saw balls of fire and blood coming
[1:00:13] out of hands and oil and different
[1:00:15] things they were impersonating what was
[1:00:17] going on but Moses came I mean brother
[1:00:19] Bram came with the gift first of healing
[1:00:21] to show God was Allah
[1:00:23] just like Moses he cast down the right
[1:00:25] into a serpent first and then Jennison
[1:00:28] Jerry's the magician's cast down their
[1:00:30] rods right so so so God God through the
[1:00:33] Ministry of the Prophet now what I'm
[1:00:35] doing is I'm showing the scripture has
[1:00:37] relived itself right so I'm showing that
[1:00:40] we're still living in the Bible this is
[1:00:42] not just some obviously book where we
[1:00:44] try and get stories and make it match no
[1:00:46] history has repeated itself and then so
[1:00:49] here here brother Bram did they did the
[1:00:51] two signs first and then surely after
[1:00:55] that many other people were inspired by
[1:00:57] his ministry and and the and the healing
[1:01:00] revival became crowded with many other
[1:01:03] ministries there was at the height of
[1:01:05] the healing revival there was about two
[1:01:07] hundred tenth healing revivalists they
[1:01:10] would travel with their own tent that
[1:01:11] hold healing revivals in America 200 of
[1:01:16] them that's not even people who just
[1:01:17] operated out of churches so so so the
[1:01:20] whole arena became flooded with these
[1:01:22] other ministries what is it to confuse
[1:01:25] the people to stop them I'll say
[1:01:28] applying the blood to go in an exodus
[1:01:32] right because if the blood has really
[1:01:34] been applied why why does that now we
[1:01:37] know in this day it's not the chemistry
[1:01:39] of the blood I could have a vial of
[1:01:41] Jesus blood right now can be authentic
[1:01:43] proven but it will do me no good because
[1:01:46] it's because that Bloods been here boots
[1:01:48] a life in the blood I could physically
[1:01:51] cover myself in his blood but it won't
[1:01:53] change my soul right it's the life and
[1:01:56] that blood has to come unto me and
[1:01:58] transform me change my nature come and
[1:02:01] dwell in me and and if that happens now
[1:02:03] then the power and the blood has come
[1:02:05] upon me now I'm a new creature I meant
[1:02:08] so so it stops people what does it do
[1:02:12] you know we're not here to promote any
[1:02:14] church you go read the history of the
[1:02:16] healing revivals / so people had you
[1:02:19] know like there was this young little
[1:02:20] you know a preacher boy David or
[1:02:22] whatever it was other denominations had
[1:02:24] their boy preachers there's all this
[1:02:26] great big competition but what it was it
[1:02:28] was to exalt at a denomination or a
[1:02:31] church movement
[1:02:32] we're not here to exalt any church I
[1:02:34] would like it if they we did
[1:02:37] even have a name on the door we don't
[1:02:38] need it we are Christians we're not here
[1:02:41] to promote a brand amen who cares about
[1:02:46] the name even who cares about the
[1:02:47] building
[1:02:48] I appreciate the building you understand
[1:02:50] cuz we can gather but it's not about
[1:02:52] this is not building an earthly Kingdom
[1:02:54] that's like I remind him brother ed were
[1:02:56] at dinner you're at our place brother a
[1:02:58] man was saying about Enoch because Cain
[1:03:00] had a son called Enoch and he built a
[1:03:02] city called Enoch so here was the
[1:03:05] perverted type building the so it's Oh
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:08] through through Seth slide head and
[1:03:10] Enoch he was translated into heaven Cain
[1:03:12] had an Enoch and he built a city upon
[1:03:14] the earth showing that that that that
[1:03:16] the devil was perverting even Enoch now
[1:03:19] through the cane line to actually say
[1:03:21] we're just going to build a kingdom upon
[1:03:22] the earth this one is not interested in
[1:03:24] being translated but God's one called
[1:03:27] Enoch took a translation right so we're
[1:03:29] not here to build an earthly kingdom who
[1:03:32] cares who cares about some brand or
[1:03:34] whatever I'm not interested no the
[1:03:36] kingdom of God is within thee what is
[1:03:39] the what is the mission statement of
[1:03:41] this church that God the Word of God
[1:03:43] would be would be made flesh in you and
[1:03:45] I that we would have a genuine real
[1:03:47] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:03:48] and that's not a catchphrase as actual
[1:03:51] reality he becomes your best friend he
[1:03:54] becomes your comforter he becomes your
[1:03:55] guide he becomes your all and all more
[1:03:57] than your next breath you'll love your
[1:03:59] joy everything you are is wrapped up in
[1:04:01] him and he is the word amen that's the
[1:04:05] mission statement that's why we're here
[1:04:07] and whosoever will let them come Amen so
[1:04:12] I'm not interested in building an
[1:04:13] earthly kingdom I don't care
[1:04:15] amen so now Jennison generous they were
[1:04:18] there and they would and and they were
[1:04:21] there to confuse the people to stop them
[1:04:23] applying the blood to leave now because
[1:04:28] as you read through Exodus you can see
[1:04:30] that they did up to a certain point the
[1:04:32] same miracles Moses and Aaron did so the
[1:04:34] first one is recorded as I said about
[1:04:36] these snakes Moses got Aaron to cast
[1:04:39] down the rod and it became a serpent
[1:04:41] Pharaoh said I've got boys that can do
[1:04:44] that too and they took this rods and
[1:04:46] threw them down they became serpents as
[1:04:47] well but Aaron's rod swallowed them up
[1:04:50] and then he picked it up by the talat
[1:04:52] turned back into a ride well where did
[1:04:53] their rods go wasn't that one showing
[1:04:56] that the power of God consumes the enemy
[1:04:58] right and also I have power to bind them
[1:05:00] power to loose remember Pharaoh was the
[1:05:02] Cobra he was the king he was the God
[1:05:05] over over Egypt but but Moses as he as
[1:05:08] he put the rod down or Aaron did he sees
[1:05:10] a power to loose you to move then I can
[1:05:12] bind you I can make you stick again so I
[1:05:14] can loose you and bind you as much as I
[1:05:16] want until my job is done showing that
[1:05:19] we have the same power to loose the
[1:05:20] devil and to bind the devil it's been
[1:05:23] given to you hallelujah Amen so so
[1:05:26] Jennison generous the other me you're
[1:05:29] the court magicians did the same thing
[1:05:31] and then when Moses turned the water
[1:05:34] into blood
[1:05:35] Genesis generous turned the water into
[1:05:37] blood and then even even in Exodus 8
[1:05:41] which is where civil innate as where
[1:05:43] these are mainly recorded they actually
[1:05:46] called frogs forth as well after Moses
[1:05:48] did but as after Moses did something
[1:05:51] they just copied it now it's amazing the
[1:05:54] thing is they could bring frogs but they
[1:05:56] could never take them away now in the
[1:05:58] book of Revelation we see that out of
[1:06:01] the mouth of the beast comes three
[1:06:02] unclean frog spirits like like like
[1:06:04] frogs
[1:06:05] so there's actually demon powers being
[1:06:07] released and so now Pharaoh Pharaoh's
[1:06:11] magicians could actually release these
[1:06:14] frogs but they could never take them
[1:06:15] away and Pharaoh actually says to Moses
[1:06:18] can you take them away and Pharaoh
[1:06:21] actually says let's just read it because
[1:06:23] to me this is astounding let's go to
[1:06:25] Exodus 8 and 9 X to the Seder 9 and
[1:06:38] Moses say Amen when you are there and
[1:06:41] Moses said unto Pharaoh glory over me
[1:06:45] when shall I entreat for the infamous
[1:06:48] servants and fly people to destroy the
[1:06:50] frogs from me and from my houses that
[1:06:53] they may remain in the river only and he
[1:06:55] said tomorrow and he said be it
[1:06:58] according to thy word so basically Moses
[1:07:00] is saying to Pharaoh when do you want
[1:07:02] these demons to stop plaguing you
[1:07:03] and Pharisees tomorrow I'll spend
[1:07:06] another night with these frogs and
[1:07:09] that's the insanity of some people you
[1:07:12] can be free but they say tomorrow I'll
[1:07:15] have another night with the devil why
[1:07:20] tomorrow don't you want a good night's
[1:07:22] rest
[1:07:23] don't you want peace for your soul don't
[1:07:25] you want the assurance that you know
[1:07:27] that you know that you know that you're
[1:07:28] gonna leave in a rapture tomorrow
[1:07:32] that's what he said Pharaoh you picture
[1:07:35] it
[1:07:35] you know who's seen the cartoon yeah
[1:07:37] here the children Bible yeah this fair
[1:07:39] honest road and frogs are hopping over
[1:07:41] them and all over the place and the
[1:07:42] servants are trying to scare them away
[1:07:44] they're everywhere it wasn't just one
[1:07:46] there one there that way everywhere
[1:07:48] it's very saying tomorrow so Pharaoh do
[1:07:51] you really want listen you're being
[1:07:52] again tonight well I guess I do I see
[1:07:54] tomorrow do you really want them in your
[1:07:55] pantry in your fridge you know and your
[1:07:57] closet and your hole in your bath and
[1:07:58] your shower everywhere
[1:07:59] yeah tomorrow that's how some people
[1:08:02] want to be they want to live with the
[1:08:05] devil one more night
[1:08:06] why oh why yeah can you put yourself
[1:08:11] imagine living in a house full of frogs
[1:08:13] and you got into your car it's full of
[1:08:15] frogs and you go to your school and it's
[1:08:17] full well people say well yeah it's full
[1:08:19] of frogs I know but you know you go to
[1:08:20] your work they're just everywhere and
[1:08:23] yet say no tomorrow
[1:08:25] keep them you know anyway it's amazing
[1:08:29] but they could not take the frogs away
[1:08:30] only Moses could take the frogs of way
[1:08:32] and then eventually win win the if you
[1:08:36] jump over to verse 16 if you still got
[1:08:38] your Bibles handy you know there's the
[1:08:40] young Moses says unto Aaron stretch for
[1:08:42] thyroid and smite the dust of the land
[1:08:44] and then it may be that it may become
[1:08:46] life throughout all the land of Egypt
[1:08:47] and then it you know then it happened
[1:08:51] and then if you read down verse 18 and
[1:08:54] the magician's did so with their
[1:08:55] enchantments to bring forth lice but
[1:08:57] they could not so there was Lysa pond
[1:09:00] men and upon beasts so it came to a
[1:09:03] stage where they could not do the things
[1:09:05] Moses and Aaron did brother ham said the
[1:09:08] devil could not impersonate the third
[1:09:10] Pole he can not impersonate the third
[1:09:14] Pole what is it so cool that's the
[1:09:16] opening of the word
[1:09:17] it's when and that's not intellectually
[1:09:19] it's when the wood comes open to you and
[1:09:22] changes you like brother BAM saw the
[1:09:23] great big vision of the great big tent
[1:09:25] and then that big tent on a platform was
[1:09:27] a little wooden room and people were all
[1:09:29] crippled and things went into the room
[1:09:31] and there was a reporter the essay you
[1:09:33] know wanted to see what happened and
[1:09:34] then wins there are more crippled they
[1:09:35] walked out fine
[1:09:36] and so the person asks what happened to
[1:09:38] you in this I don't know saying haven't
[1:09:41] we see the reason it was a secret is
[1:09:43] because so the devil could not in person
[1:09:45] that he can't impersonate the full word
[1:09:48] of God and then the Lord says I'll meet
[1:09:51] you in there the pillar fire goes in
[1:09:54] there so you take saying I'll meet you
[1:09:55] in there so it's a mystery Union in a
[1:09:58] tent between the bride and Christ and
[1:10:01] when that union takes place where once
[1:10:03] crippled with sin but now we walk out
[1:10:05] fine and yet because people can really
[1:10:08] ask you you know you tell them the
[1:10:09] testimony I mean you tell them your
[1:10:11] testimony and you try and describe what
[1:10:14] happened but you can't really describe
[1:10:15] what happened what happened to you in
[1:10:18] there I don't know but now look at me
[1:10:20] I'm not the same person when I walked in
[1:10:22] so I'm not the same person I was when I
[1:10:24] heard the word I'm now different and the
[1:10:26] devil kind of person ate the full Word
[1:10:29] of God on display so that's why the
[1:10:32] magician said oh we can't do this come
[1:10:34] to a certain point we can't do this a
[1:10:38] man didn't omit didn't the magician sit
[1:10:40] under fear this is the finger of God and
[1:10:42] Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he
[1:10:44] hearkened not unto them as the Lord had
[1:10:46] said why saw so them him operating those
[1:10:49] gifts it was to harden Pharaoh's heart
[1:10:52] to confuse the people to stop them
[1:10:54] applying the blood and going in an
[1:10:56] exodus see that's why sure other people
[1:11:02] have healings that's all fine remember
[1:11:05] it's already been purchased they have
[1:11:06] visions they have dreams sure but it's
[1:11:09] the word that's received what is the
[1:11:11] word to do it's to take us from this
[1:11:13] world to the next world as Enoch walked
[1:11:16] with God and was not because God took
[1:11:18] him right this is what this message is
[1:11:21] actually God walking with you I meant
[1:11:25] just like I've said about Luke 24
[1:11:26] brother Barron preaches the sermon
[1:11:28] modern events and make clear by prophecy
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:31] Luke chapter 24 the two on the way to
[1:11:33] Emmaus what is now what happens normally
[1:11:35] and I don't know if I really achieve
[1:11:37] this but the opening scripture I read
[1:11:39] the rest of the scripture the rest of
[1:11:41] the sermon expounds upon what I've read
[1:11:43] so in brother and preaches mondo Vincent
[1:11:46] made clear by prophesying goes to Luke
[1:11:47] 24 he's now saying that them these
[1:11:50] modern events and made clear by Luke
[1:11:53] chapter 24 which is a prophecy so what
[1:11:57] does the prophecy entail the
[1:11:58] resurrection the two on the way to
[1:12:01] Emmaus are brokenhearted because their
[1:12:04] Messiah that they loved had just been
[1:12:05] crucified putting the Roman two and they
[1:12:08] think he's dead he's never coming back
[1:12:09] and they're going back to Emmaus
[1:12:11] downhearted because their world has
[1:12:14] fallen apart but then there's a man who
[1:12:17] comes walks with them and they don't
[1:12:19] realize who it is and he says Oh Falls
[1:12:23] and slow of heart and he starts at Moses
[1:12:26] and he goes all the way down through the
[1:12:28] scripture concerning the prompt the
[1:12:30] words that Jesus who who he is has
[1:12:33] fulfilled in their day and he walks with
[1:12:36] him for six hours showing them in the
[1:12:38] scripture who he was and then finally
[1:12:41] they go into the house and secret he
[1:12:43] breaks the bread he does something he
[1:12:46] did before he died to show that he is
[1:12:49] the same and it's the same thing so but
[1:12:51] the reason that he did that as he walked
[1:12:53] with them that they would recognize they
[1:12:55] are part of the resurrection also
[1:12:57] because they had to be in the upper room
[1:13:00] remember we once dead but now being
[1:13:02] quickened we've been been made alive by
[1:13:03] the Holy Ghost right so they it wasn't
[1:13:06] just Jesus caming out of that roman tomb
[1:13:08] right it was also the bride coming out
[1:13:11] as well and they were part of that
[1:13:13] bright so that's why he walked with them
[1:13:15] showed himself in the scripture that
[1:13:17] they would understand and know that they
[1:13:20] would not miss what was going on in
[1:13:23] their day
[1:13:23] not that they would just know about it
[1:13:25] but they done durst and they are part of
[1:13:27] the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:13:29] well I'll pour my spirit out upon all
[1:13:31] flesh which was happened in the upper
[1:13:33] room so now the Son of Man comes in
[1:13:36] another form just like the turn the way
[1:13:38] to Emmaus he came in and you're in
[1:13:40] another form they didn't know who he was
[1:13:42] it says their eyes were holding from
[1:13:43] them that they would
[1:13:44] who he was he came in another form and
[1:13:46] Jesus has come out of history in another
[1:13:48] form and a prophet Vail right and opened
[1:13:52] his word to us and he's been walking
[1:13:54] with you all the way until your eyes
[1:13:58] come open and see Lord it's you
[1:14:01] amen remember he did something now I'm
[1:14:03] just going to close with these points
[1:14:04] but he did something in this state that
[1:14:07] he did before he was crucified well is
[1:14:09] that discerning the thoughts and tends
[1:14:10] of the hearts of the people brother and
[1:14:12] said this is the sign of the
[1:14:13] resurrection the sign of the Messiah
[1:14:15] right and he says then you become the
[1:14:18] sign of the resurrection because he was
[1:14:19] dead now you've been quickened alive to
[1:14:21] the Word of God right sir so he walks
[1:14:23] with you
[1:14:24] that's why you know it's you know it's
[1:14:27] so astounding we've seen this would be
[1:14:29] crucified we've seen it be rejected
[1:14:33] we've seen our world almost just fall
[1:14:34] apart and we under what's going on and
[1:14:37] it had to happen that way around the
[1:14:40] world because of the prophecy happy euro
[1:14:42] so if it happened in the prophecy it's
[1:14:44] got to happen in the fulfillment but he
[1:14:48] walks with you he's walked with you that
[1:14:51] you had known understand your part of
[1:14:53] the rapture that's why after he did the
[1:14:57] side of the you know broke the bread and
[1:14:59] he disappeared they realized who he was
[1:15:01] she didn't our hearts burn within us as
[1:15:03] he spoke along the way so that word that
[1:15:06] he has spoken gripped them like other
[1:15:09] words didn't and it's like this message
[1:15:13] I pray it it's gripped you more than any
[1:15:15] other words around
[1:15:16] it's gripped you our hearts burn within
[1:15:19] us we didn't fully understand who it is
[1:15:21] but in our eyes come open Lord it's you
[1:15:23] hallelujah and he's walked with you
[1:15:26] because you're part of the rapture amen
[1:15:31] they he walked with them till they
[1:15:33] understood they were part of the
[1:15:34] resurrection he the same son of man and
[1:15:37] a different form has walked with us and
[1:15:39] word for me has walked with us that we
[1:15:41] would understand we are part of the
[1:15:43] bride we're part of the rapture amen how
[1:15:46] we doing
[1:15:49] but the thing is now I'm gonna finish I
[1:15:53] don't want to go too long but we have to
[1:15:55] examine and
[1:15:57] see if the blood has been applied
[1:15:59] because remember Jennison generous were
[1:16:02] there those spirits were there upon me
[1:16:04] and to stop the people applying the
[1:16:06] blood and leaving in an exodus and it's
[1:16:09] the same thing that they religious
[1:16:10] spirits are here to try and stop us
[1:16:12] applying the blood and going in a
[1:16:15] rapture amen that's why that's why the
[1:16:19] devil just says no not just just go
[1:16:21] along to church you boys know and I'm
[1:16:23] sure you have you know you've always
[1:16:25] been a believer and sure and gods mom
[1:16:28] avoids being a believer but it's got to
[1:16:30] come a time when you meet him right
[1:16:31] there's got to come a time when it's
[1:16:33] more than just a mental understanding
[1:16:35] but God actually you know I was I was
[1:16:38] just you know I'm just simple enough if
[1:16:40] he's alive forevermore I can meet him
[1:16:43] that's just me maybe I'm just too
[1:16:45] elementary but I'm pretty happy that way
[1:16:47] so don't try and confuse me with some
[1:16:49] complicated stuff you know so if he's
[1:16:52] alive you can meet him and he is alive
[1:16:54] she can meet him right so there has to
[1:16:57] come a time just like the Apostle Paul
[1:16:59] the pillar of fire came on the road to
[1:17:01] Damascus he was doing his own thing in
[1:17:03] life but then God came his way and the
[1:17:05] God that he read read about if history
[1:17:07] became a reality and then he began to
[1:17:09] realize who he was in the scripture I
[1:17:12] mean but that was not just something he
[1:17:14] learned it was an experience and it's
[1:17:17] got to be the same thing with us I mean
[1:17:19] because that's why you know people are
[1:17:20] so confused Who am I what bathroom do I
[1:17:23] use you know am i whatever walk in yo
[1:17:25] because the world today you can be
[1:17:27] anything you want but who does God say
[1:17:30] we are you know and if you know who God
[1:17:33] says you are that gives you stability in
[1:17:35] life you know it's like my girls it used
[1:17:37] to be you know that every game they'd
[1:17:39] play I'm the you're the daddy beer
[1:17:42] mummy's the mummy beer with the baby
[1:17:43] beers oh I'm the mummy eagle this is the
[1:17:45] Betty eagle we're the baby Eagles it was
[1:17:47] always like how do we fit in this game
[1:17:49] and I don't have to tell them now now
[1:17:52] this is how you've got to play games
[1:17:53] know that just playing games because
[1:17:56] they needed to see how do we fit in this
[1:17:58] unit right it's human nature to want to
[1:18:02] fit somewhere that's why people are
[1:18:05] looking for identity right but the thing
[1:18:09] is it's when God God is here to give
[1:18:11] your identity he's the daddy Eagle
[1:18:14] you're the baby Eagles hallelujah and
[1:18:18] you fly up on the heavenlies hallelujah
[1:18:21] remember that your brother Ram says just
[1:18:25] examined to see if the blood is there
[1:18:27] didn't let off the pressure but the
[1:18:30] thing is the blood has to be applied not
[1:18:31] just to your body you know people get
[1:18:34] anointed in their flesh but their souls
[1:18:37] unconverted people allow the Holy Spirit
[1:18:40] you know cuz remember it's the door and
[1:18:41] the lintel three sides body spirit soul
[1:18:46] people go to meetings they get anointed
[1:18:48] they have a wonderful time but then they
[1:18:49] crash back down whether it's just on
[1:18:51] their spirit but the blood has to be a
[1:18:53] play and people get inspired there
[1:18:55] become ministers they've become song
[1:18:56] leaders deacons whatever more they get
[1:18:58] inspired anted but then they go back out
[1:19:00] into the world why because the blood was
[1:19:02] never applied to their soul the life of
[1:19:05] God was never in the soul that's why
[1:19:07] you've got to say Lord don't just anoint
[1:19:09] me one time change my nature change my
[1:19:13] desire change everything I am remember
[1:19:15] it's your choice that leads to them that
[1:19:17] that door that goes between the spirit
[1:19:19] and the soul ground brother Graham says
[1:19:20] that's free moral agency member faith
[1:19:23] and doubt operates it but it's exact he
[1:19:25] says in one place free moral agency it's
[1:19:28] your free moral choice we you know will
[1:19:30] you give up and let them come in or will
[1:19:33] you just keep them back for a bit and
[1:19:35] I'll pick that up another time but
[1:19:37] that's that's where we're going
[1:19:38] hopefully in a couple of weeks time but
[1:19:41] the blood has to be applied to every
[1:19:43] part and never ever let some spirit try
[1:19:48] and stop you applying the blood to go on
[1:19:50] a rapture because the devil is trying to
[1:19:52] hold on this world is trying to become a
[1:19:54] cage to keep people and you know brother
[1:19:57] Graham says those spirits that were that
[1:19:59] were released against the Jews in the
[1:20:01] Holocaust Feast of the trumpets he says
[1:20:03] those same spirits in ecclesiastical way
[1:20:06] a religious way I turned against the
[1:20:08] bride what did it physically do put
[1:20:11] people in death camps just exterminated
[1:20:14] them very efficiently horrible those
[1:20:18] same spirits now turned against you in a
[1:20:21] different way we have to recognize it
[1:20:25] they men I'm not cool to live in a
[1:20:28] spiritual death camp I'm a free son of
[1:20:31] God where are free people I'm in the
[1:20:34] devil has no right to put us in any kind
[1:20:36] of prison and exterminate us as he will
[1:20:39] I know as the Jews were you know as the
[1:20:43] Jews came out of World War two and they
[1:20:45] came to Israel and they're determined
[1:20:47] we're never ever ever going to let this
[1:20:49] happen again and they and some of them
[1:20:51] are still very determined we're never
[1:20:53] ever ever going to let this happen again
[1:20:55] and they pass it down to their children
[1:20:56] as their national identity but now it's
[1:20:59] come 70 odd years where people are
[1:21:01] starting to forget and the devil's
[1:21:02] trying to tell people the Holocaust
[1:21:04] never happened right but there's a
[1:21:06] people in that land saying we're never
[1:21:08] ever ever gonna let it happen to to us
[1:21:10] again and it should be the same thing
[1:21:12] with us we've come out of Darkness week
[1:21:14] I came out of a death camp hallelujah
[1:21:17] but but but those prison robes have been
[1:21:19] taken off well-being rope with the robe
[1:21:21] of his righteousness I've come out of
[1:21:23] the death camp and I'm determined I'm
[1:21:25] never ever ever going back I've never
[1:21:27] ever ever going back
[1:21:29] I mean I'm free God has called my
[1:21:30] Liberty I've walked out hallelujah and
[1:21:33] so we've got to instill not just an
[1:21:35] appearance for the young people there's
[1:21:36] a devil trying to destroy us but we're
[1:21:38] never never never going to be slaves in
[1:21:40] any form where are free people we've got
[1:21:43] our own nation we're going to run flag
