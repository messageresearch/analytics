George and Sister Sister Esther here from Christ j God bless you trust you feel at home welcome it's great to have brother anini back as well after being on you know work for so long but God bless you great to see you amen let's turn to Genesis 24 let's see if I can drive this thing is that me perfect amen let's go to Genesis 24 and then we're going to um go to the Book of Mark and um also the book of X here amen God bless you all so this is um not going to read the whole piece I take portions out of Genesis 24 which is alas are going to go get uh a bride for Isaac and um I just want to use this as a bit of a context if I want to could put a title to this I want to say uh it's a new day this in Genesis 24 and the servant this is elazer took 10 C uh 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to uh Mesopotamia unto the city of nahor and he um and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that the woman came out to draw water so the evening time it's very significant time in the scripture and we're going to drop down to verse uh 53 and the servant brought forth Jewels this is after Rebecca comes out and after Alazar has prayed he says Lord uh let let the damsel come out I'm just paraphrasing and may she not only give me water but give water to to the camels and this is what uh Rebecca does and then it says in the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and rment and gave them to Rebecca and he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and they tarried all night so this is this is so so the evening they come to the well then now they're teing all night now it comes to another day and and Rebecca's life is already changed quite significantly we'll come into this and then he and the men that were with him and they Ted all night they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at least 10 after that she shall go we drop down to verse uh 56 and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master and they said well we will call the damsel and choir at her mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her wil thou go with this man and she said I will go and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servants and his men amen unless just go to uh Mark 16: 1 and 2 but just as you're turning there notice it wasn't elazar wasn't there very long he turned up in the evening and the next morning they were gone Hallelujah so Rebecca went to that well many days no doubt but that day was different she was part of Prophecy she was already been influenced by the angel of the Lord she didn't realize it but she was already predestined to be the Bride of Isaac amen hallelujah but then at the dawning of a different day things were different Hallelujah Mark 161 and2 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary uh the mother of Jesus and and salom had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him so this is anointing the body of Jesus this is the this is the day after the Sabbath and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the Seiler at the rising of the sun now I'm just going to read one more scripture because I well how are we doing can I can I drive here we go and it's go to acts 5: 18 and 20 this is my so next next weekend is Easter we're going to be up at the convention in Oakland this is my Easter messag amen hallelujah I'm glad he's risen aren't you amen and so and he and and they laid their hands on the apostles this is the scribes and Pharisees and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them for and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life amen Hall let's bow our heads again for a word of prayer Lord Jesus how glad we are amen father I pray you just Hallelujah speak to us in a special way want to commit the service into your hands Lord may all critical Spirits be gone father May every heart just receive your word and Faith dear Lord wherever this will go Lord I pray Lord you would find prepared ground may your word come forth a h hundredfold take all gloom and doubt and fear away from every heart Lord in Jesus Christ's name I ask amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning in the presence of the Lord so I want to speak about you know it's a it's a new day as I said about about uh Rebecca as I said you know she she came to a you know she came to the well and she came to this well many times but there came a I can't I can't don't worry about it I'll just leave it up um but this was a different this was a different time she knew the well very well but there came a different day in her life where she wasn't meant to stay at her father's house she was ordained to be married to Isaac she was ordained to leave her father's house and be United with the son of Promise Isaac and we know that the son of promis is our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so so here she is she has no idea that that Abraham has commissioned alaza you know to go find his son a wife she has no idea that that that Abraham has said the angel of the Lord shall go before you and shall find the damsel she has no idea about this she's just living about her everyday life but you know she was being influenced by the angel of the Lord to to not only give water to the camels but give water to to to alasa and not only that but to say yes I will go this was a very brief you imagine this everyone who has who has daughters that can get married you know marriageable age someone just turns up some long lost someone from somewhere other side of the world maybe and says my f you know my master has a son and and he's fall iner of all things and I've come to find him a wife and the angel the Lord led me here and I was maybe I walked out the airport and I prayed and and your daughter was here and you know and all these events just happened and now you know imagine it imagine it you put it into today's language imagine that happened and then something and then you'd say well hold on but alas says no don't don't hinder us and then it comes down to her decision see it wasn't you know you know it came down to her decision will you go she said I'm going because she come beg to realize this as alaza shared the testimony of the prayer and the angel of the Lord going before Amen to prepare her she began to realize I I'm the answer to that prayer I mean I'm the answer to this and she just said I will go Hallelujah she has influence it was a different day it was a different day in her life Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I amen you got to realize we're part of the word we are where where it says the and the bride has made herself ready in Revelations 19 and it was granted unto her that she' be a raid and fine Lin and clean and white which is the righteousness of saints I trust when you read that there's something in you says I'm here to fulfill that amen cuz it's been granted to me that I'd be ar raid and fine Lin and clean and white it's not my own ability it's what he's given me to put on he's given me the weding Garment the word to put on hallelujah amen so I trust you see the you the marriage of the Lamb has come and it has come who's been United Hallelujah to our Lord amen so now I'm just going to skip through these a little bit but I just want you to think of it's such a adorning of a new day can mean so many different things to so many different people to a lot of people another day is another day but to the bride of Christ another day is wonderful hallelujah hallelujah amen Mary Magdalene they they they came to the tomb they're expecting to find a dead form of who they believe would be the Messiah they're expecting to anoint him they knew all about death they knew all about burial they all knew all about anointing the dead amen and and mourning over them and you know they knew about tombs but this was a different day Hallelujah and they found themselves it wasn't them uh orchestrating this whole thing God was orchestrating the whole thing they just happened to find themselves there happened to find themselves come under the influence of this Jesus of Nazareth come to just find themselves hearing his word and it wasn't in them to say he's beab it was in them to say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God they just found themselves in this state Hallelujah and they you know and I'm sure they come to realize they were predestinated am mean to receive the word in their dayj but they came to the tomb expecting to find a dead form but he wasn't there Hallelujah but the stone had rolled they came at the rising of the sun it was a different morning AMJ amen Saturday morning was a sad morning Sunday morning the day after the Sabbath was a very different kind of day hallelujah hallelujah because it wasn't someone had stolen his body away they found he was risen am he was now alive Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends I trust that he's become so alive to you amen that it's not as as Brother Andy I don't know if he C coined the word or if it's actually a part of our English vocabulary you know how people historification real one was where they crossed the Red Sea all those things are all perfectly well but he's still a god of History well you could go to the den and tuon you can go to Jeffersonville you can go to mount Sunset you can go to the Ohio River all that's all perfectly well but that's history amen all those things should build your faith sure but it's when he comes out of History the god of the Prophet the god of the word comes out of history and he reveals himself to you now that's very different that's a different day cuz now it's not someone else's testimony it's your testimony amen as it says it says in the law Thou shalt not bear a false witness and many times we take that as people saying lies about one another but bearing a false witness is when you have no testimony to be a witness right if you're a false witness you don't have a true testimony right and if you have a and if you are a false witness it means you weren't there when it happened amen you're bearing false witness so it's it's like a you know it's like Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them and the scribes and Pharisees saying no we are the real Believers we have Moses but they weren't bearing the fruit of Moses they were bearing the fruit of religion they were a false witness of Moses right they were a false witness of Moses and it's the same thing with a real believer in this day by their fruits you shall know them the life that is produced by that you shall know them amen and if the life is the life of God then they are a true witness but if it's not the life of God there are false witness right amen amen and that's why I love this I love reading through the Bible don't you amen four chapters a day you'll get through it in a year apparently wow but he says here go tell stand and go stand and speak in the temple of the to the people all the words of this life amen he didn't say go and explain it amen or go tell where everyone's wrong go speak of all the words of this life amen this life he was living was very different to the life he lived even just a few days before amen this was a different kind of life this was now eternal life was now in them resurrection power was in them Deliverance was in them Hallelujah healing was in them amen they were redeemed people you know I was thinking about it if someone's been redeemed they're very they live a very very different life to when they were a slave very different you take the you know you take those in Israel you know we're here not just to talk about him but we're here to you know and we should have the evidence the proof that he's risen amen the EV the the the direct evidence just as the disciples had the evidence the living proof that he was alive from the grave he arose not just because the tomb was empty but because the life that was in him was in them am mean that they could actually prove by the that they were living that that he had risen that he was not dead that it wasn't just some religion not some other man's idea but he truly was Messiah I mean that he poured his Spirit out upon All Flesh and now they were living witness I mean that God had truly poured his Spirit out upon them Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends we are to be a living witness I mean our lives are a living evidence a living proof am mean that Jesus is not dead amen that is not just some tradition but he is alive forever more because his life is in US amen I'm going to probably plow through that point a lot but I really want it to Anchor deep amen that we are amen the bride is living proof amen that he died on Calvary he is living we are living proof that the seals are open amen hallelujah the bride is living proof that this is true amen hallelujah amen so go stand and speak to the people all the words of this life as the as Jude would write to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered for the you know once delivered to the saint to contend for it not against something but for something and that's why we're here amen I believe our lives are contending for the faith not against the world but sure it's wrong but for the faith we're going to have a cause for something Hallelujah not just against the scribes and Pharisees their whole cause was this man's beab this is something hatched up this is wrong this is contrary to our understanding it must be wrong they were just against that's right but the disciples were for amen hallelujah so we should be contending for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we should be contending for reality of the word amen we should be contending for healing amen for deliverance amen for to be made new creatures in Christ amen we should be contending that the word is true that this message lives hallelujah amen that he's not a god of History shouldn't we be contending for something hallelujah oh Hallelujah now he says this is in the rising of the Sun he says now the day now the Sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and and and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live amen and the first light that was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the Earth then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across it's raised uh and dried up the waters from the Earth and it made an atmosphere above and for the first time it was to bring forth joy and life to the Earth by a seed that was a great hour oh but it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning this time when the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater Sunrise than ever because it because it came greater news with this Sunrise than it did at the Sunrise of the beginning this Sunrise brought a news that said he is risen he is quick from the dead as he promised he is risen from the dead amen the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose it was a duel sun rising another sun rising it was not only the Su n Rising it was the s o n had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promis seed that by for knowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth amen amen no more could the boty life lived back there at the beginning without the Su to bring it to life no more than today when the sons of God is upon the Earth it takes the S so n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world so I just I just didn't know where to stop with this and on Easter morning then in this dirt laid somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven uh there was a book of memory and as attributes was in him knowing that because this son of God raised it would also raise to life every son that was foreordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious Sunrise than what it uh than what it was at the beginning at the time when it first dawned oh this great breaking of the Easter seal Hallelujah we have to friends this is more than just a sermon to me when he preaches it's the rising of the Sun he's making a declaration am the same one that Rose there on on on the first Easter as the same God that's come now in this end time to Quicken the predestinated ones to bring them to life because the son of the word amen has risen Hallelujah and now he's shining upon the Earth am mean this word broed upon you over the Earth just like any Prophecy in the scripture like Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive 800 odd years later it found a seat to land into and me to bring for the promise and it's the same thing with you and I this message has been maybe sitting for 40 50 60 years amen but it's waiting for you to come H waiting for you to come upon the Earth amen there's something in you said Hallelujah I believe it and it quickened and it became alive a living reality to you amen hallelujah hallelujah we have the direct evidence that Jesus Christ is risen Hallelujah we have the living proof amen Amen brother BR said you want to see proof of Resurrection just find someone who's been quickened from Death to life that want living in the gther of the world under all kind of demon power and God Quicken them am me the life they once lived they live no more Hallelujah the world has evidence of a resurrection Hallelujah We Were Once Dead I don't know where you came out of it's irrelevant where you started it's where you finish that's the thing that matters hallelujah we're going to finish around the throne redeemed Hallelujah but we may have come out of religion may have come out of the world Amen but one day say something quickened to your soul it became a living reality his word became a living reality oh hallelujah amen Ephesians 3 And1 for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of grace of God that has given me to you woods now he's saying I'm going to if if you've heard about this dispensation of Grace is given to me how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four and a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ amen I won't go down the rabbit hole I'm thinking of which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men but it is now revealed unto his holy prophets I mean Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit see he's saying it wasn't revealed now but now he's saying it's been it has been revealed to His Holy Apostles and Prophets by his spirit so he's saying there are prophets in the New Testament that God brings his word too amen is this okay Hallelujah you know you know Jesus said that the that the Lord and the prophets were un to John and many people take that and say well there's no more prophets now but what what Jesus is saying is there was that dispensation but now here's another day you're not under the blood of the blood of bulls and goats is coming to an end because the real lamb is upon the Earth Christ is our lamb Hallelujah so he say the law and Prophets are un to John but now everyone presses into the kingdom of God Amen so now the Apostle Paul is saying that th things that weren't known into the Old Testament is now Reve is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit amen I mean that the Gentiles should be fellow and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power hallelujah hallelujah now these things are made known amen as I said if we've been redeemed we live a very different life we live a very different life we do not live the same life and just say we're Christians right amen the the children of Israel when Moses came to deliver them they didn't stay in Egypt being slaves that's right they left slavehood they left Egypt amen those those slave masters were no longer beating them was no longer whipping them no longer taking their trying to take their sons and throw them in the Nile after they were born amen they weren't under that Dominion no more God redeemed them by Blood and by power brought them out of Egypt amen hallelujah and took them into the promised land and you could take Caleb and you'd say one day I was in Egypt but then it didn't it you know but then there was a dawning of a new day when the death angel passed over that night but the blood covered the house we were safe and we left Egypt am Hallelujah and all it was after that was now just the victory or the manifestation of that Redemption amen here they were they came to the Red Sea what's going to happen they're all panicking have you brought us out here to die no God God told them God told Moses exactly where to take the children of Israel amen God was sitting up an ambush it wasn't the Egyptians sitting up the Ambush but the Israelites said thought this would be the greatest Massacre that ever be but God brought them there you know the Red Sea parted amen these ones are not slaves anymore they're not going back amen hallelujah they cross the Red Sea the Egyptians try to follow and then the water comes crashing down and the ones that used to oppress them have been now killed and destroyed in the Red Sea Hallelujah and it's like us when we repent to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what's happening because redemption's come upon us am mean they the those demon spirits that were upon us and making us slaves am mean they get drowned get destroyed amen their their effect is no longer on us anymore we've been redeemed sir Hallelujah and then hallelujah you know that's right then they then they become free people are you following me so I'm I know it's very obvious but they didn't stay in Egypt when Moses came along amen they left Egypt amen they went to the promised land amen hallelujah and we are in a Third Exodus hallelujah we're no longer slaves to the devil or slaves to this flesh hallelujah we're a free people amen now he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it couldn't not live it had to be on the earth and also gerti no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the S wi shines upon it notice now he came to share it with with us he says no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news what if a man died for our sake that's good news if Christ was born that's good news but never a news never was there news like this that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise that he's alive forever more and has the keys of Hell death death and hell in his hand all the Gloom was shook away there's no more Gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave there was no well he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel the good news amen so isn't it what see so it's like so so he's the one who made the promise has confirmed the promise Hallelujah and it's not only that he rose from the grave but it's I trust he's confirmed the the promise of his word to you amen hallelujah amen when he said if you repent and be baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen I trust that he's confirmed that promise to you Hallelujah that he's actually received your repentance amen how do you know he's received your repentance when he fills you with the Holy Ghost amen when you're willing to give every part of yourself to him then he confirms it by sealing you into the kingdom amen amen that is great news Hallelujah notice the very message of the Gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen go tell my disciples I'm risen from the dead and I'll meet with them and confirm this to them oh God how in this last day there shall be a light across the Earth and I'll prove it to my disciples go tell them I'm not dead and I'm not a tradition but I'm a living Christ I'll meet them take this message to my disciples that I'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right that's exactly right amen amen that's what our Commissioners go tell that he's alive go tell this message is true amen the message has always been he's risen and it's not an argument to prove he's risen there you should be living evidence that he has risen Hallelujah that's why the devil tries to tell us to push back and you know compromise on what we believe no He's Alive amen amen my redeemer is alive Hallelujah my headship is here amen the resurrected Christ is here amen hallelujah and that's why we need to go tell us to disciples he's not dead He's Alive amen hallelujah hallelujah what does this message come to do unite the body with the head amen unite the body of Christ with the headship of the word that's what the message is here to do Amen to unite you with Christ Hallelujah and what and and and what has happened I trust you can say yes that did happen to me I became United amen with my Lord Jesus Christ and the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God it's not the life I used to live amen it's not just a patched up life it used to be it's not just me changing my ways a little bit no it's a totally new life it's not my old life patched up amen it's not just me conforming to an idea but he has risen amen he's now in me producing his word in me hallelujah amen aren't we new creatures in Christ am mean we're not a this is not a patch up this is not the aa7 steps to coping with your problem that's not what the gospel is the gospel is a Deliverance a total Deliverance amen a new birth amen healing and Redemption that is what the gospel is to make us new creatures hallelujah amen amen if we jesus' first Doctrine is you must be born again amen now to be born again does not mean that we just turn over a new leaf and try something different a you a real birth is when you die out to your thoughts die out to everything you were die at the altar am mean that he fills you with the spirit changes your nature and you become a new creature in him amen hallelujah the dawning of a new day amen see cuz I don't just want to bring this out while it happened there it's got to be a new day to you hallelujah hallelujah that brother bramwood tell a story in the pardon about when the emancipation of Proclamation was signed for the slaves in in America now the emancipation of Proclamation was was was when it was put into law am mean that every slave had to go free on a certain day you know hallelujah amen and and this was after the Civil War was fought so great Great War was fought in order for the slaves to go free and then there finally came a time when the war was won and the and the law was put in force by the by the government that on a certain morning at the rising of the sun they were legally free people hallelujah amen and and and we're told on that day that you know because it's when the sun came up is when the law came into so at a new at the dawn of a new day these people are no longer slaves but they are free men and women Hallelujah so so when but yo before the sun came up Hallelujah before the sun came up the youngest ones who could climb up to the top of the mountain amen they climbed up there waiting for the dawn to raise and the and the Young and the old who couldn't climb up there they waited down the bottom Hallelujah so so they watched their young ones go up to the top of the ridge or wherever it was and they're waiting for the sun to come up Hallelujah and when the sun and no doubt cuz you know when it's just before Dawn you see the Sun come come come I mean you see the Sun Ray come above the Horizon who's been at adorning of a sun Hallelujah so the sun rays come up and then then the Sun comes above the Horizon then the sunlight hits you Hallelujah so they saw it Dawning but when the sunlight hit them Hallelujah they were in darkness it's always the coldest and darkest before Dawn but when the sun comes up I mean the of the Sun hits you you're no longer in the gloomy darkness no more you're an adorning Hallelujah so when the sunlight hit them they could cry down to the bottom we're free amen the Sun's Up hallelujah we're a free people and then no doubt the people down the bottom could look up and see them bathed in sunlight they begin to Rejoice but they haven't felt the sun rise yet Hallelujah but as the sun dawned Higher and Higher and Higher and me the Shadows went away then that same sunlight that hit the one at the top of the mountain now hit everyone at the bottom of the mountain Hallelujah and now that's why the prophet went to the top of the mountain the top of the pyramid and he says it's the dawning of a new day it is the rising of the sun amen the same one that rose out of the grave as aisen in this hour Amen to Quicken you to his word amen that you'd become a living reality of his word hallelujah that this would not just be written you know written on paper be written in the hearts of your flesh and the your in your heart that you would live Hallelujah and he declared it's the rising of the sun many of us weren't born at that time oh amen many people didn't ever catch what he was talking about but he's making a declaration it is the rising of the Sun the so n is risen hallelujah we're living in a different time I trust it means a lot to you it means a lot to me Hallelujah and then uh and then but then finally we're like the ones at the bottom the sunlight hits us H we're no longer in cold gloomy darkness of religion but the so n light strikes us and we can Rejoice saying we are free amen hallelujah amen hallelujah we are the beneficiaries of his life amen he has the same yesterday today and forever we his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life there was never a life lived like that he was the son of God and he died and that shuted out but when he raised again from the dead on on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living how can you do it by word only for it's written the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive amen so this gospel is not word only it's not argument only it's not debate only it's not putting facts together only amen but is the power of the I just we'll just read it he says he says for the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manif uh uh manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive Hallelujah and he says so this is what I was want to go to he says knowing bre knowing Brethren beloved your election of God for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know that what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you became followers of us you know the Apostle Paul said be ye followers of me that's right he wasn't ashamed to say be follow me as I follow Christ be followers of me he was pointing to himself is that extreme that's what he did go read your Bible he said be followers of me Hallelujah this is this is what you should do amen as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you became followers of of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost so he says that the he says the gospel did not come unto you in word only hallelujah amen this is very this is very important because it's more than just man am mean the gospel is you know if we read in Mark 16 go into all the world preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe not just the and these signs shall shall follow them that believe H do we have Believers here today I me that means that means this will happen in your life lay hands upon the sick they shall recover amen speak in new tongues you know drink any deadly thing that shall not harm them these signs shall follow Hallelujah and it says at the end of the chapter and the Lord went with them confirming the word was signs following so it's more than the disciples and their words but what they spoke God came and behind am mean to vindicate what they were saying was not their words but it was God's words am Hallelujah that's why you take virtually every message Amen brother br's preaching he says now if I've said the truth if I be a servant of the Lord if I've said the truth let him come down and prove it to be true amen and what happened God came down in a way that was unique to the other minist trees that were on the field amen hallelujah and God came down with the sign of the Messiah not just healing but the sign of the Messiah amen the revelation of the people's hearts Hallelujah and that was God now coming in behind saying I'm here to back up what he said hallelujah amen and it should be the same God's behind his bride the Lord Jesus Christ is behind you amen hallelujah we're ambassadors of Heaven are we not amen that means All That Heaven is is behind you I mean you've been you've been given the you know you've been given the authority to speak in Heaven's name and if you really speak in in in Heaven's name you won't say anything contrary to the word amen hallelujah amen so the so the gospel came not in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance I trust it's come that way to you amen I mean this message has it not has it come in power to you not just on tape now the same God that was on tape that was was with the prophet is now with the bride hallelujah amen amen so I trust he's come to you in power Hallelujah and in the Holy Ghost amen it's more than an argument more than changing your lifestyle but God comes and lives he manifests his word he proves himself alive Hallelujah and in much Assurance well how's it much Assurance well the God we read about in the scriptures alive today the god you hear on tape when God comes down at the end Hallelujah I heard a prayer line uh was it was 1956 God test God using his gift and Sh port and God just comes down at the end and there's and there's a discernment line and there's a woman who's not feel sorry um I don't have it on me but but she's not she's been feeling very bad for Years brother Brown prays for her and he says you feel different though you uh uh don't you lady and she just cries out yes I do Hallelujah and God discerns all you know you know many people and brother Braham has has taken off the platform cuz he's so weary and you I think you hear I think it's brother Jack Moore you if anyone wants to receive the Lord come forward and hear everyone come around and someone some woman screaming out thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and everyone's crying out Hallelujah I say I've heard that before I've experienced that before Hallelujah because the same God that was back there amen is present today amen hallelujah he hasn't changed one bit he hasn't diminished in power one bit amen it would it would have been wonderful Amen to to to sit there in brandom Tabernacle and hear the seals preached it would have been wonderful to be there when he when he after he preached the revelation Jesus Christ the church Age series that that God came down the pillow of fire and Drew out the church age on the wall that would have been incredible it would have been incredible to see a woman uh you know you know a girl with no eyeballs be prayed for and then and then the prophet asked mid prayer what color eyes do you want and and she says well I hear Blue's the best and two blue streaks come down to her eyes and blue eyes are formed in her eyes that would have been pretty amazing amen but God put us here in this day amen to be a living witness Hallelujah that he is the same today as he was yesterday the same God in the book of Acts is the same God today he hasn't diminished he hasn't changed one bit oh we're living in a different season well when the enemy comes in like a flood or raise up a standard Hallelujah we don't need to be afraid we don't need to be worried the world has to be this way that's right everything is running on God's time piece perfectly fine that's right Hallelujah he's not worried oh it's so dark you know even even the prophet when he said he said I predict I do not prophesy okay so so anyone who knows English will know the word predict and prophesy not the same word but he says I predict I do not prophesy that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and to usher in the Millennium he's not one he's not prophesying it will happen he's saying I predict I do not prophesy because he saw the world was getting so dark so quickly that surely it could not continue on past 1977 he says it ought to terminate the World Systems and ought to usher in the Millennium you look at the death who's been ushered into a place amen who's come to a restaurant and there's a sign that says please wait here to be seated but I'm I'm going to go sit down so now now you're the you know are you with me so no no please wait to be seated I'm waiting to be seated so it's going to take time for me to be ushered to my seat and then now here comes the weight stuff welcome to blah blah blah with your how many table for what I'll now Usher you to your seat and there's a process of time where you leave from where you told to wait and you walk along and he says can you sit here and now it's like I've been ushered in hello it's just you just look at English definitions ushering actually means a period of time as well amen hallelujah Glory but he was he was saying it's getting so dark so quickly I can't see it go past that time and you just think you know I think about it yesterday you take the Prophecies of the Old Testament you take you take when you know David he said uh my God my God why has th forsaken me and he's speaking in first person and it was so real to him he was living out the crucifixion you know and and you know there you know when Joel would prophesy of behold I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh what do you think he would have been like if he was actually allowed to go from that prophecy and live out the prophecy he would have been next to himself what do you think would have been like for David remember under the blood of bulls and goats the seed in them wasn't Quicken like it was under the blood of Jesus Christ and he says as the heart pan for the water Brook so my soul Longs after thee he was an odd kind of man he had a longing I just want to be in the presence of the Lord and dwell in his Tabernacles and you know but but the longing in his heart could never be fulfilled because he was living under the blood of bulls and goats so imagine that when he had that longing as the heart paned for the water Brook so my soul Longs after thee Hallelujah he had seen God Live come on he had seen God live he had seen him do many mighty things but his heart longed for him imagine if he was transported to today oh my hallelujah or or to The Upper Room hallelujah hallelujah where it wasn't just a desire that that that could never be met but that desire could not you know wasn't just just long for but it could be me I mean that the seed in him could have been could have been quickened he would have been beside himself Hallelujah rejoicing now imagine if the prophet was here today the things he saw my what do you he would be he'd be tearing the place up hallelujah hallelujah are you following me when he saw the world go it's going to go insane the seven Visions he saw in 33 what do you think he would be like Hallelujah Hallelujah these people would be rejoicing hallu because it's more than just when you know God's going to do something it throws you into expectation amen so if you're just so so if you're a prophet in the Old Testament or even imagine the Apostle Paul imagine him in this day he writes to the Thessalonians we which are alive and remain he's prophesying Hallelujah most of his writings are prophecy we which are alive and remain should not hinder or prevent them which are asleep but the dead in Christ arise first will be called up to meet the Lord in the air the Lord himself will desend with a shout voice and you know imagine if he you know he was imagine if he was here right now do you think he would be excited Hallelujah he was he was he was under expectation that that that he would be in that group of alive and remain amen but but he'd be the dead in Christ so imagine if he was here and and and the Lord quickened to him you mean the Lord is descended with a shout oh yeah you mean we're living in that se you mean you're living in that season Hallelujah he'd be rejoicing amen you mean the consummation of the ages is on you mean Israel's back as a nation you imagine yo Matthew scribing down Matthew 24 when the Fig Tree puts forth its buds and it's been there for 71 years or whatever give or take Hallelujah do you think it wouldn't throw them into expectation it wouldn't throw them into just great excitement and rejoicing saying Lord you're they're living in the season cuz Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree put forth his buds you know that summer is n and this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled Hallelujah do you think that would get them excited it would get them real excited hallelujah amen now even so we as I said we're living in a time well I was saying about to be redeemed if we're really redeemed we live a different life amen than you even so we when we were children we're in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth the son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and we know that that word adoption in the Greek is the placing of a son in the family Hallelujah so it's not getting someone just like me going to China and and finding a baby and and bringing it to back to New Zealand and writing some papers and saying this is now my child this is not what adoption is in the Bible the adoption in the Bible is the placing of a son in the family amen so so they are no longer just a you know that they come to a position that their word is good as the father's word hallelujah so so this is where we have we we have come to I'm saying if we have been redeemed amen it manifests in our life Glory Hallelujah is everyone okay today amen I trust this means a lot to you so to redeem them from under the law that that we might receive the adoption or the placing of sons and because ye are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and of a son then an heir of God through Christ Hallelujah so because we are Sons because we are daughters that's why he moved upon your soul that's why he quickened his word to you because you are not because you became this I'll just Rejoice myself Hallelujah cuz cuz I like this I didn't become something and then I received the Holy Ghost because I am because I am a son or a daughter that's why I Reed the Holy Ghost where the son of his Spirit into my heart where I cry Abba Father or my father my father Hallelujah wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and of a son than an heir of God God through Christ Hallelujah can we go again one more second Corinthians 3 but unto this day when Moses has read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so he's saying when Moses is read this day there's a veil upon their heart they can't see what he's saying right it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense and it's not clear he says when that Veil is taken away amen then then they shall see amen and it says that now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now this word Liberty means a freedom and that and and the root word of this word Liberty means to go unrestrained to go at pleasure as a citizen and not a slave as Freeborn Hallelujah so it's not someone so so someone who's a free man or a free woman to be at Liberty so that means that this so with the spirit of Lord is there is liberty so that Liberty means that we're no longer slaves amen we're now Freeborn we're now we're no longer servants but we're citizens of the Kingdom hallelujah we're no longer slaves to the devil no more amen but now we're citizens of the kingdom of God hallelujah and that's why you see someone when the veil is taken off because people are still veiled today amen the world is veiled today today but when that Veil is taken off their heart amen they are no longer under the bondage of the devil or under the slavery of this flesh amen but now they're at Liberty hallelujah amen but we will with open face unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord hallelujah so we are TR changed we are transformed into the same image Amen to the image of his word by the spirit of the Lord Hallelujah so we're a free people amen now I'm going to get back into um I am talking about uh Alazar and Rebecca still because it's a different day and you Havey quickened I trust you don't mind the reading who were dead in trespasses and sins according in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air that spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also you we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so saying you have he Quicken so you were once dead amen you once dead and trespass and sins and you once walked according to the course of this world so so the arrangement of this world I mean you once walked according to it amen by the I mean according to the prince of the power of the year which is the the prince of the power of the year is the so we all walked in this world under his Dominion all of us did amen we all did amen and that spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience this is how you once were but you've been quickened amen you're now alive I mean you're not a dead person anymore you're a living being am mean you've been raised to eternal life thank you Lord what a rising of the sun this is I mean when a sunrise struck your heart Hallelujah I mean among whom we had our conversation which is Manner of life in Times past amen and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so our nature was of the children of Wrath that's right I'm just waiting to bring these things out cuz this is what we were that's right but we're not anymore am we once were this way Hallelujah but now we've being made new creatures in Christ so I'm saying that if we' been if you've been redeemed you're a different person am so much amen but then um I don't know if I have it on here but it says but God who's rich in Mercy Hallelujah has redeemed us to himself Hallelujah now I said all this I can't wait I go to the last one I said all that because I trust that in your own life that the sun has risen amen that the sun has risen in your life that is not someone else rejoicing it's not someone else that the words come open to am mean that you see the son of man and the hour it's not someone else's testimony but it's your testimony amen that he's risen in your life Hallelujah that you were once dead hey you can be raised in a message church and still not be quickened I mean you can be dead and trespassed in sins you're not exempt because of the family you are from or whatever you know you got to be made alive amen hallelujah but if you have been made alive amen it should mean the world to youen Hallelujah because now you have the evidence you are a living witness that he rose from the grave yes Hallelujah that is not someone else's testimony you are now living witness go and tell the people all the words of this life Peter was told Hallelujah this life is eternal life am mean there's a full Redemption Hallelujah there's healing in this life we now walk in newness of life we're no longer slaves to sin Hallelujah we''re been quickened hallelujah amen brother brandham in the last part of his ministry he uses the term genan seed the gene seed of God 1965 he uses it more there than he does in the past however many years he preaches cuz he comes down to about now he says it's like he says he says it's like you know just take Natural children you're in your father you are part of him but he wanted to have fellowship with you there was a desire we want to have children but he couldn't have fellowship with you if you still in him she had to be born into the Earth Hallelujah and then he could have fellowship with you amen but you are a part of him am mean genetics has proven it right DNA has proven it they can even take now there's um technology at the um um at my work and they can actually differentiate multiple blood uh um sources in a crime scene amen they they can divvy it all up and anyway that's another conversation but you know but but they can they can work out and then and then they can even now they're trying to work out from blood and and DNA from identical twins based on different uh chemical patterns in the DNA but you know he talks about the Jin seed of God Amen and he says it's like God you were part you were in him just like uh just like Levi was in the loins of Abraham when he paid tithes to mzc he was in him the scripture says right but you had to be born into the Earth cuz God wanted fellowship with you amen and the reason this word is Quicken you is because you're a you're a part of God you're one of his children you're one of his attributes upon the Earth Hallelujah so it goes you know God's taking it down to the very core of the believer the reason that it's quickened to us the reason we're drawn to him amen the Lord Jesus Christ is because we're a gene seed amen we're part of his family and you'll find out that family traits are passed down Hallelujah you take Natural you know children you look at your parents the older you get the more realize you're more like them you can't help it the traits they have they passed down to you whether you like it or not now that's just a natural lineage amen but God has traits as well God has traits of faith God has traits of being an overcomer Hallelujah God has a traits of Deliverance of healing hallelujah amen and the more you walk with him I trust the more you can see I'm just like Daddy hallelujah hallelujah because of because of our Lord Jesus overcame he overcame hell death in the grave he overcame his culture he overcame the religions of the world he overcame all manner of pressure Hallelujah and then he birthed some children forth in the upper room and they overcame their culture they overcame their religion they overcame all kinds of pressure why because they were manifesting what was in their dad hallelujah what by the new birth they were manifesting what was in their father hallelujah hallelujah and it's I trust it's the same thing with us hallelujah amen if we're his children we'll do like he did amen hallelujah and that's why when you go back through the scripture Enoch was a genan seed and he walked with God and was not cuz God took him amen so so if part of the family did that the rest of the family will do that amen he's pointing to you there's a trait being manifested amen Abraham could you know staggered not at the promise of God not even coming into consideration the deadness of his own flesh or the deadness of Sarah's womb but he believed the promise amen amen if he did it we'll be the same way hallelujah amen because family traits are passed down Hallelujah and brother brah brings out the Jean seed and it's very to me it's very there's a reason why he spoke about it so much at the end of his ministry cuz he's saying now it's more than just people get anointed they do all kinds of things but it's that seed on the inside amen and the devil what does the devil always try and knock you about you're not a Believer you're not a Christian do you think you're really walking in the faith and he's trying to attack your identity he's trying to attack your family origin right amen just like imagine now this sounds very ridiculous but imagine someone went up to my girls you think you're a gloin you think Ben and Christine are your parents you think you really are and it wouldn't take too much you just that's a hold on come meet come meet them then they come stand next to us so there's family resemblance and you see facial expressions traits it's like people time travel but but if someone came against their identity that's say that's say that's just ridiculous come meet my parents just the life they live and the life I live Prov that they are my parents Hallelujah and it's the same thing people come against you you say oh this is this is all Folly this is wrong this is a cult this is you know crazy he said hold on hold on the life that I read about in here the same life I see in here amen is it cuz Christianity is not an argument amen Christianity is a life am it's eternal life in a people that's what to be a Christian is to be Christlike and the only way you can be Christlike if he is in you amen so that to me pushes all the argument away Hallelujah because it's a Life by their fruits you shall know them by the life that is manifested in them amen amen that's how you know them that's right Hallelujah so the Devil comes along he says you think you're really one of them you think you're really a Christian you think you're really saved by grace he's trying to attack your identity that's right amen but you've got to stand there and say no I know who I'm born of Hallelujah I know who spoke to my heart and it wasn't a preacher it was more than a preacher more than a tape even more than letters in a book but it was the Living God took his word and anchored it in my soul Hallelujah and you got to stand there and you say devil I know when I met him am I know when I met him Noah was so gripped by a short visitation of God I'm going to destroy this Earth because the wickedness of the world now build this Ark and he saw by Vision the ark and he so gripped by it it didn't matter what people said you know there would have been voices on the outside of the ark that turned people to get out of it or turn people not to go in That's How Strong the criticism would have become oh yeah but Noah was so convinced amen Noah was so gripped am he said this is the way am this is going to bring us safety hallelujah hallelujah and it paid off amen it doesn't matter how ridiculous it was to the world it was God's provided way was that Ark you know the Apostle Paul you go read you go read the Apostle Paul most of his writings he doesn't reference with the Old Testament amen he says this just like what we read the Revelation I received that when you read it let's go back to that I'll put it up maybe I go here he says for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of Grace of God which is given to me to you so I've received a dispensation in that word is the economy of God the economy of Grace that I received that I'm going to giving to you how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery how he he's not he's not AO you know he's not apologetic he says God showed me the mystery that the Gentiles will become the body of Christ God showed me this mystery and I'm going to tell you amen amen he wasn't looking for a consensus among the Apostles he said God has shown me this and I'm going to show you this hallelujah amen how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote before you in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of God so when so this is what he said I'm just reading the Bible amen I want to go into this because it's amazing you know but he said this is the mystery I've been told and I'm telling you that when you when you read it you may understand you need so what he's saying is you need to catch my Revelation that's if you you need to understand what I have received I didn't go to Jerusalem to get this I didn't speak to Peter about this I received it directly from the Lord where are we which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men so what I'm telling you they did not know what I'm telling you Moses didn't know what I'm telling you David didn't know what I'm telling you Abraham didn't know what I'm telling you Isaiah didn't know hallelujah it's been headen but now I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you what it means Hallelujah are you following me that the Gentiles should be fellow amen by the gospel wherefore I was sorry which is now revealed let's go back to verse 5 again so which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men but it's now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so what they didn't know now is being declared Hallelujah the Apostle Paul was actually moving into new territory amen amen you follow me he was breaking new revelation and he didn't ask Peter what it meant he just received it from God and he gave it out Hallelujah and he says in other parts of the scripture he says well if they don't see what I believe they're just blind the God of this world has blinded them that's why they don't see it you read the New Testament he wasn't apologetic he was just saying this is how it is if people don't see it they're just blind if they don't understand what I'm writing I mean they they're just blinded by the God of this world that's right Hallelujah but he's saying now it was been hidden now it's been Reve revealed Hallelujah that that' be to the Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit amen that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel wherefore I made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power he was not he was not reluctant to say these things but these kind of statements are very inflammatory in this day and age that we live that's right amen if the Apostle Paul was alive in this generation he would have been he would have been murdered on social media amen he would have been murdered on social media his his his word would have been cast to the ground he would have been labeled as a fanatic and and Outcast right amen but he was not he was not ashamed he said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen he knew who he was he was so gripped by that visitation on the road to Damascus amen he said I met the Lord Jesus Christ he has come and met me he was not ashamed amen and his life was now a living witness that he met the Lord now if he was so unashamed how about you and I that doesn't mean you just blast it to the four corners of the Earth but you live a life I know who I've been called by I wasn't called by man you read you got to read so many of his Epistles I was not called by men I was I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ has called me how you say well I'm not an apostle brother Ben you've been called by God youve been called by the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so now if that's the same way we should be unashamed of what God has made us amen if I've been redeemed I've been redeemed if I'm a new creature I'm a new Creature if he says I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer if he says I'm more than a conqueror I'm more than a conqueror Hallelujah if he said that's what I am that's what I am if Daddy said Daddy said my daddy's the biggest than all the daddies Hallelujah so so my daddy said I'm just going to take my daddy's word and if someone comes to you and says no you are not you are not a Christian I'd say hold on look at the life in this word and look at my life and my life should reflect this hallelujah amen because we are living manifest we are living proof that he rose from the dead hallelujah how do you know he lives because I met him one day amen and he changed my life when I wasn't looking for him he found me now I might get it wrong but it says that Mercy goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days of thy life it says in the Old Testament where's that effect that word follow actually means to chase after and capture and to actually get hold of chase after and and and pursue and get amen so when I wasn't looking for his goodness and mercy it was hunting me down GL and it found me Hallelujah and I trust it's the same thing with you and I when you weren't looking for God God was looking for you you say well I sought God no no man seeks God God seeks man amen it says in the Book of Romans not one seeks after him not one but he found you and there was something he put that Gan seed in you that responded when his word came your way something in you said yes yes Father amen my father my father oh yes Hallelujah and you had a and God reveal to you man didn't reveal it to you you know if man can you know the most dangerous words a person can say about the message is it makes sense because that's just up here amen it should go more than just making sense it's got to be anchored down in here because someone can come along with an argument that makes more sense and can talk you out of it but if God has revealed himself to you personally amen that you can be like the Apostle Paul I shall not be moved hallelujah hallelujah I know I know in whom I have belied and am persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've given to him against that day Hallelujah so I think we should be unashamed oh yes amen you mean God would use me as a billboard absolutely absolutely you look at the category of people God used in the scripture amen we are no different Hallelujah that's right amen let's just leave it there shall we we have the musicians please I trust it's a different day for you the life you now live is a different [Applause] life let's stand shall we going to sing that song I know my redeemer lives but I know my redeemer lives not just cuz the tomb's empty but because he's revealed himself to me how
