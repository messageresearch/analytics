meeting leave human control father the devil might be under your control of God Father in Jesus Christ's name pastor all the doctors father in Jesus Christ's name we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name Lord we ask amen hallelujah thank you both Isaac thank you musicians I mean good morning everyone hallelujah glory amen it's just a couple of announcements just before we turn to the scripture so we're having our second Thanksgiving on the 10th of November and on the desk there at the front there's two invitations for each family here or individual and one invitations for you and the other invitation is for South your family or friend that you want to invite so amen so we're gonna have a glorious time and also so just a reminder 4 p.m. today we've got communion foot washing we have lunch at the hub as well and on the 9th of September the Saints from fielding are coming down with some fellowship whatever give Li time hallelujah amen so let's let's turn to the Gospel of John let's go to eighth chapter excuse me amen so John 8 and verse we're gonna read from verse 30 31 let me go down to verse 38 then jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free I want emphasize that if you continue in my word there's a continuing then you are my disciples indeed who wants to be jesus disciple and then and then let's see the the what will happen and then you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and they answered him we be Abraham's seed were never in bondage to any man shall say thal you shall be free jesus answered them verily verily I say to you who so whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sins and we know ultimately is unbelief and the servant abideth not in the house ever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father Amy may the Lord blesses word this morning you may have your seats I want to speak from I want to speak from the from from verse 32 my subject you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad that there's a jesus promised that you know if jesus promises anything it shall be so so it's not you might know the truth or you might know part of the truth but you shall know the truth and the and the manifestation of knowing truth is you shall be free Amen so now the truth is not a coping mechanism to cope with the devil and his devices it's not be something a crutch to get through life no we have Liberty and in the saints of God the Bride of Christ has full Liberty I mean we are not here to put up with a devil part time no we're here to be free indeed hallelujah whom the Sun has set free is free indeed and I am very convinced that the Sun the Word of God is present to make us free indeed we're not here to be stuck up with the devil half the time and God half the time now we're free maybe we're God's property we belong to him we don't belong to Satan or his devices hallelujah so we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free the purpose of the truth is to make us free from the devil that's the purpose of the truth now this isn't verse 31 if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed now to continue it's a verb it means to stay in a given place a state relation or expert expectancy to abide to continue to dwell to endure to be present to remain to stand to tarry you to continue in his word and if you can when you lose worth then you are his disciple and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free hallelujah so we're going to continue in his word not just start and then get off and someone's idea because if you get off on someone's idea you won't be free if you continue in his word you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now the truth is not relative it's not relative to the day or you know time has changed societies change therefore the truth changes the truth doesn't change it's not relative to anything around us that you know man is still actually the same you know civilization may change culture may change but man is still the core of them are still the same and God does not change the truth is not just a collection of ideas that are correct it's not just it's more than that now you say well and I just want to drop this in here what is alive a lie is the truth perverted a lie can carry a lot of truth you take the serpent speaking to even the garden yay hath God said he preached a lot of truth to to Eve to the woman but it was a lie because it was that it was that little bit that he injected that caused death to come into the world send to come into the world so a lie will make you bound the truth will set you free mostly truth will bind you just like Eve got back she was free she was living eternal being there's no sickness or pain death nothing to hold her down but in the devil gave a mostly truth and the outcome of that statement was sin and was death so you going to look at what does it produce what does the product produce people bring out all kinds of health drinks and health medications thing well what does it actually produce people can make a lot of claims but the proof of the pudding is the eating their off and what I mean by that is what result you get out of it is the proof of it works or doesn't work I mean if it works it works hallelujah this message work for the kingdom I've experienced it I'm free and I'm still free hallelujah you got a look at so be that what does a lie he says it is the truth perverted somebody said it was Saturday night 9 o'clock yet Bill Brandon was and Jeff ins a vote this is correct down at Anthony's saloon drunk alive what was it I was in Jeffersonville that's true I was it was the righteousness perverted to a lie see what I mean see a lie provide it's something that told where I was at now if I see it at the church preaching correct that's righteousness he told the truth at the tavern drinking alive right so the there's choice given was alive that makes it a perverted truth yes perverted truth will not free of people amen as I said the truth is not just a collection of ideas that are correct it's beyond that the truth is actually a person jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so it goes beyond the collection of ideas is this right is this right yes well that's truth now the truth is a person truth is God God is truth right and then and then John 1:14 in the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth it means for the truth is the person so when Jesus said and you shall know the truth he's saying you shall know me and I will make you free hallelujah and there's no power greater than our God and then he went down to hell strip the keys of health in the grave of Satan a man ascended on high hallelujah he defeated he defeated death he defeated sickness he defeated unbelief he defeated every kind of devil he conquered everything he conquered it all places like people playing computer games he said well like luck the game hallelujah he clocked everything he completed the highest level hallelujah he conquered all and he's still the mighty Conqueror and he wants us to be free hallelujah truth is a person that person is Jesus Christ the Living Word more than words on print anyone can quote the scripture but what is it produced I mean he's a living God and I'll say this in a fee if if the truth is a person which is the truth became flesh and dwelt among us the truth heals I was gonna say the truth healed because he read the Gospels he did but it but he's still the present God so the truth heals the truth casts out Devils the truth went to Calvary the truth took our sins upon himself the truth came out of the tomb the truth came down there Peter come the truth met Paul on the road to Damascus hallelujah and the truth I pray and I trust has got ahold of you amen that he came down when we when you are not looking for him the truth found you and the truth set you free holy the truth reveal themselves to you I'm in the another servant of sin anymore your your love prisoners of Jesus Christ hallelujah I mean in the truth shall make you free and here in the Sun is set free is free indeed hallelujah we don't have to put up with a devil raging against us amen my battles they can come to an end they should come to an end demon not just position but oppression kick it out you don't have to put up with a devil warring against you makes me feel down and we're in with drunk it costs it up the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all these things amen I believe it the truth sets people free and the truth still sets people free yes no all the Bible is true yeah all the Bible is true but it's the truth and the season that is important right brother Brown gives a very simple illustration what would good Moses come preaching knows message let's build an ark well it was a different season what Noah did was truth the ark was true it was true the flood you know the rain came and the flood happened but now Moses was living a different season yes what good was what good was Moses to preach Noah's message because it was now a different season but still true right I mean what good was John the Baptist to preach Moses message because John the Baptist ministry was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children to turn them away from the traditions of the Pharisees and scribes in the Old Testament to turn the hosta there and see the Living God right so what was good would he be to say now let's restore the priesthood he was in introducing the everlasting priesthood hallelujah Melchizedek himself becoming flesh a real high priest and you can go down all through so now what's good me standing here preaching those message to you it's true what could be preaching Moses message to you it's true but we're in a different season the Apostle Peter said this wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things that you know them and be established in present truth we need to be established and present truth because present truth is where God is manifesting himself and where God is manifesting himself that is the truth manifesting and if the truth is manifesting then he heals then he delivers I mean then he you know sets us free he forgives sins hallelujah everything that Jesus purchased on Calvary has manifested through the truth so we want to be established in present truth now the truth the truth is vindicated and when I now this is my this is the being blind dictionary definition of vindication I'll say divine vindication when God comes in and he says this is me speaking that's vindication I mean it goes beyond human argument goes beyond he should see said he did that when God comes in and you take a perfect example of Korah Dathan against Moses they rose up against Moses they said you think you're the only holy one God doesn't only speak through you and then Moses is okay what we're gonna see who's actually speaking for God and if God opens up the earth swallows you up then you'll know and then God came in it's one thing for a man to say something now for God to come in behind and back up who is actually speaking and then what happened the earth swallowed them up it was done I believe I think that as a vindication God was with Moses because God came in behind what that man said when he stomped into Pharaoh's Palace he let my people go I mean God began to vindicate to prove the Pharaoh was too proud his heart became hotter and hotter and hotter we know where he was raised up for that purpose but he feels just neutral he could essentially said well now this is actually their God doing this right I don't want to fight against this one oh my you can go if he had half a brain cell he would have said that half a spiritual brain cell but he didn't it goes beyond argument of two opposing views God comes and behind it and proves it then Jesus spake again unto them and we're in John eight again saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life holy I'm glad we're not walking in darkness and fear the Pharisees therefore said unto Him thou barest record of myself though recorders not true jesus answered and said unto them though I be a record of myself yet my record is true for our know whence I came and whither I go but you cannot tell whence I come and whether I go ye judge after the flesh I judge no man and yet if I judge my judgment is true for I'm not alone I am the father that sent me has also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true I am one that bears witness of myself and the father sent me birth witness of me amen well how did that how did that happen Jesus spoke something and it happened well he calmed the storm Jesus said it's not me that doeth the works as the father dwells in me he doeth the works see saying that God came in right and backed up what he was saying hallelujah and I say the sale it's just jumped down to 2018 right the Bride of Christ has a witness God backs her up it goes beyond man's discussion amount argument with God comes down produces a life and the people that's God saying this is what my Bible produces this is what my word produces amen by their fruits you shall know them by the life that is living out of them that's how you'll know what they are hallelujah and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and that will be manifested in their life because they're free hallelujah I mean that's exactly right I don't fear it's one that bears witness of me that's the father you should be able to say the same thing it's one the best witness of my life that's my father in heaven he comes in and confirms what I'm doing to be true amen you had a look at the life you're manifesting jesus said in john 5:39 I don't have this on the PowerPoint search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are that which testify of me the very word they are claiming to search they're testifying of who Jesus was and it's the same thing today the Scriptures testify through the brightest in this our true John 14 10 see it's believeth doubt not that I'm in the father and the father and me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake so if you can't take what the word spoken he's basically saying just look the life that's manifested and believe the works they testify of Who I am hallelujah that is truth when God comes down supernational Eve indicates his word you gotta say that's true God saying that's me right and and the lettuce in church age as as Jesus is declaring himself he says the faithful and true witness is speaking to you right Jesus himself is saying I'm the faithful and true witness so he's there he's declaring that he is faithful and true and if he is a faithful and true witness he will back up his Scripture right he will manifest why the scripture says what happened in this day now I'm going to read this from works his faith expressed but now remember keep this in mind you got to go you got to take yourself back 2,000 years ago when Jesus was there a lot of people said a lot of things about him but what was the life he was living what did that declare because that should be your argument right what life was manifesting out of his life what was he producing amen you got to take that that's the truth right that you'd say no that's true John the Baptist they called him a wild man but what life was he living he was fulfilling the scripture for his day it was true yes but if it is taking place didn't believe that it's him and that day the Son of Man will be revealed amen the Son of Man will be revealed in a body of flesh you people the church just exactly like it was before the days of Sodom right a called out group away from all them sitting out believing the promise of God glory then the works of the Holy Spirit is doomed to think by these visions never-failing promises never failing all the Apostolic Science promised in the Bible of Malachi 4 no revelations 10 7 and all that's being fulfilled and proved by scientific every other way and if I haven't told you the truth these things would not happen but if I've told you the truth they bear record that I've told you the truth he's still the same yesterday today and forever and the manifestation of the Spirit is catching away a brain let that faith revelation fall into your heart this is the hour now now let us pray he says did God who was manifested in the flesh and the person of Jesus Christ that raised up from the dead on the third day according to the scriptures and it seemed it on high and sent the disciples out to disciple all the world he said these signs shall follow them that brought to the Pentecostal church of this day the restoration of the gifts may God Lord these men may be some of them prison here some of them hearing the tape around the world may they realize that this is the calling out of the bride not a Pentecostal age the Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back to the church but this is the calling forth of the bride and other message that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned let them understand their God faith I believe this because it's revealed by your spirit through the Word of God and has been vindicated and made manifest to the whole world he always has done it he never changes his pattern seeing the Prophet could only speak if he's true what God tells him is that right that's true now do you believe him he could tell me what's the matter with this woman before I even look at her do you believe it why is she suffering with cancer that's right it's on her breast she's got to blow on her mind he's suffering with a kind of a mental condition nervous condition and complications that's right you believe that and that's true isn't it you believe now that your faith by saying that has anchored that you've got it and you're going to have it then go and the Lord Jesus will make you well Amen see do you believe do you believe with all your heart now do you believe without looking at this woman now speaking to someone else the Lord Jesus can tell me what your trouble how many believes then I've never even I only the thing is I just seen a skirt I don't know couldn't tell whether it was a man or woman just standing there I want her to believe you believe lady here's the patient do you believe raise up your hand if you believe if you believe with all your heart you can have that baby you're asking God for you believe you have faith in God now that don't heal that just identifies that's the works that identifies the faith of the presence of God his word made manifest now he's speaking this woman is wanting a great need to to someone else it's not a baby but she's wearing the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what to do if you'll get rid of them cigarettes God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost God believe it see do you believe have you faith in God this man standing here is a man I've never seen in my life I don't know him but he's suffering with something wrong in his chest he's had a fall that did that not longer he wasn't from here he comes from I can saw he's a preacher gone home and preach the gospel I've never seen the man in his face there's a woman standing here I don't know the woman never seen her in my life God knows her if he can reveal what her trouble is or something about it would you believe all of you this is the only work identifying the faith that I had to preach that I've told you about tonight this is what God's revealed and this is the works proving it now you've got to have faith to get well this woman here I don't know I don't think I know her yes I don't know who but I know somebody knows her because I've seen him standing here before me she's suffering with a headache isn't that right lady you believe that God will heal you peregrines sister that's right I've never seen her in my life that try to seem Peregrine standing here looking at me going like that that's all right I don't know where Peregrine's at do you believe how much do you believe if you can't believe all things are possible I don't believe sorry if you can't believe nothing can happen that little lady with gray hair sitting there looking at me right here do you believe God you believe that God can reveal to me what you're thinking about there you've got a tumor on the breast you believe God can take it off you that try to have faith and belief now what did she touch the woman that touched the border of His garment the Bible said you that want to get the Bible he said he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities isn't that right he said high priest he's standing right here now people are touching him here's a little thin woman raised up her hand sitting right here I've never seen her in my life but she just then touched something here's what it was she's praying to God she has trouble in her chest she also has stomach trouble God healed you if you believe it you must believe all things are possible to them that believe there's a man sitting way back in the back looking this way about second row coming this way suffering with asthma you believe God will heal you sir if you believe it God will make you well you can have what you asked for if you believe it here's a woman sitting right here looking at me across here gray-headed if you believe the all your heart you believe it all right that gallbladder trouble will leave you then if you believe what do you think about it laying here on the Kop you believe God can heal you what did I read so much that was God saying this as me this is God saying this as me it goes beyond you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free hallelujah and that same God is present here that same God isn't just back there he's present here he healed those people he healed me he set me free he made me the truth came to me hallelujah amen now John 16:13 14 howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and will show it unto you so in the spirit of truth has come a min to you he's not just speaking broadly speaking when the spirit when the truth spirit of truth is come he'll guide lead you and guide you personally into all truth you'll you'll receive a guide hallelujah and that God will keep you free amen amen notice the Lord says all truth he will guide you into all truth not just a little bit of it but it's all truth brother Graham says that by word in 1951 he says and now God wouldn't let me tell you part truth and not rest of it truth he wouldn't stand for that God is all truth hallelujah now we want to walk in all truth I just want to read this here now all truth people can take phrases we say the church world speaks about being born again the evangelical by the church world and they believe in the blood those terms are true but what is what happens when people take phrases then you've got to see what does it produce right and so now let's read this Jude one and three and four beloved I give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith we want to contain full right we want to not against I'm just going to go this way a little bit we're not here to go against we're for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints try for the faith that delivers for the phrase that fills people at the Holy Spirit well the faith that produces the life in Jesus Christ the people for the faith that heals for the faith that guides people through darkness for the faith that comforts for the faith that's hits free when contending for that faith holy which is Bible faith I mean you'll see what you're contending for what product are we selling we got eternal life hallelujah what does eternal life do you shall know the truth of the truth shall set you free he whom the Sun is set for his friend deed Paul II and God can chop you free you don't have to be put up with the dealers not some Tiger walk let them cut the rope walk on with God leave your past behind you hallelujah well there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our Lord dot of our grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now what did they do they turned the truth they turned it into something else right but they all seek but they said oh we all believe in grace grace is true but they made into something else which was false all right so turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness now let's just you know when I I know I've shown this to you before but I just prayed last night Lord it's us and every soul this is what grace really is it's not some fluffy idea of looking sin graciousness is gratifying this is from the Strong's Concordance of manual act abstract or concrete literal fricative or spiritual especially like they would especially especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life that is God's grace I mean with is a divine influence the influence of God the spirit of truth comes down upon someone's hot and it influences their heart that descends you once said you cannot do once love you detest holy are the things you would never do now you love hallelujah I would never be here before I wouldn't be interested in a Sunday morning I'd be hung over someplace hallelujah I never come into a place like this and a divine influence came to my heart walk this way son go the way you walk the way of life and it's reflected in the life that's why God says with your lip stage or denied to me but their heart is far from me that's not grace upon someone that's just lip service God looks beyond lip service he looks at the faith in your life because now the life we now live we live by the faith of the Son of God right I let not faith in the Son of God but the faith we live by the faith of the son of God God's revelation comes into you and now the life you live how you conduct yourself how you treat your family how you treat your colleagues how you treat people on the street you treat them according to the faith of the Son of God in your life hallelujah some real dance dance that have the faith of God in their lives there they are Jesus Christ their family they treat them like Jesus would treat them hallelujah they would love them give their lives for them like Jesus would they're not selfish in are self-absorbed of God thought self-absorbed as he self-absorbed no he gave it he gave all he gave all and he's not somewhere far away not interested in your life he's there every step of your life he understands what you go through he understands your battles Hillary understands the questions you may have amen our God is not some distant fellow he's more interested in himself in an and his children his bride oh yeah I'm glad way the Bride of Christ how God loves us I've got kids for us I've got it's here to Thank You Santa rapture yeah he's got some distant husband the beach down a beach town beat up he's here to lift us up Peleliu easier to lift us up boy I wish I had boys to scream this everywhere hallelujah I've got kids by the brand saw the vision of us you know he saw his mother but it looked like his mum but wasn't his mom than his dad who had a club but it wasn't as dead a three-sided club every time that woman would try and get up that man would beat her down and then should recover try and get back up again he'd take that Club beat her down again and he realized that's the devil three-sided Club Trinitarian doctrine even denying we're in there let's go back even denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ you see you see the attributes of it it beats people down it beats down you say well oh that's in the church world in the family that religious spirit beats people it beats the children down it beats the wife down amen God's here God's here to lift up and I say if you may have been beaten down in your past don't be a slave to your past we should be so gripped by our future will you be so gripped I got streets of gold to dance on I live in a rapture to take that should affect us a lot more than our past I mean Caleb had a resurrection Mountain he wasn't worried about the scars of being a slave in Egypt that was done his oppressors died in the Red Sea brother Liu he is on the way he was gripped by words totally wish me gripped by this words caretakers in a rapture amen he received his inheritance he wasn't a slave to us past we should not be a slave to our pastor Peter the blood of Jesus Christ the path the life that was in that blood is in this room hey I mean I guarantee you I mean he is here he said well I but I've been this way for many years Moses was 30 years in the wilderness I mean in the desert that's a long time who's 80 heaney when he 80 oh yeah worried but you know Eddie is a long time he was living 40 years the backside the desert with a desire that wasn't meat he knew he was the deliverer he sent in for that much time I think God called him on a burning bush that burning bush came God came down and his past was gone haleh he delivered there's not be a slave to our pass range be a slave to your future whatever you do they mean especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life that's New Testament gross that's the power of the Cross to release a divine influence upon the heart of the people and it's reflected in the life amen now the graces as I see it it's a truth phrase or saying but what is produced in the life is different if this error with that now voice wondered what does this word lasciviousness it's not common Street lingo these days so I looked at it and in the Greek let say what see this an uncertain driven drivet ization but apparently meaning contentment but in a negative contentment Lyceus nurse sometimes including other vices filthy the Sevilla sness wantonness now we're just going to and so the definition of Lyceus nurse is lacking legal or moral restraint especially disregarding sexual restraints the Cistus behavior marked by disregard for strict rules of correctness this is part of this word lasciviousness right and the definition of wantem because wantem this is another word for lasciviousness one term means merciless and you who main wanton cruelty having no just foundation or provocation right being without chick or limitation and Julie lavish playfully mean or cruel hard to control undisciplined unruly it's also one given to self-indulgent flirtation or trifling used especially in the phrase to play the wantem a lewd or lascivious person a pampered personal animal pet especially a spoiled child a frolic aresome child or animal that's what this word lasciviousness is they turn the grace of God into this unchecked no just foundation no limits right hard to control undisciplined unruly so what have they turned it into basically they turn it into God is a good God you can do what you want you see a spoiled child here so let me leave me give a let me give a demonstration what a spoiled child errs Johnny go clean your room it's a spoiled child doesn't listen doesn't care not interested it's all about them that's a sport cha so why had he turned the grace of God into that they have changed a divine influence upon the heart and the reflection it's life too basically God's grace is so great I can do what I want and his word is not important well where do they get that idea from that's the old serpent preaching again Genesis 3:4 and the Serpent's II don't woman ye shall not surely die so basically saying you're God's Word doesn't really have that effect it doesn't really matter what he says that serpents been preaching down through the ages amen they go people who have turned to this they don't care what the scripture says 1st Corinthians 14 37 I said it last week I want to say it again if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge to the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord that means if your spiritual or a prophet you will acknowledge that the writings of Paul are the writings of God and not his ideas his his way of leaning the Pharisee background whatever it may be it's God speaking it's God's Word hallelujah and if it is God's Word and grace is coming to you I mean then that word will become flesh in you amen hallelujah now from the from the you know Christianity is a life Christianity is a life it's not a phrase it's not something we say it's a life lived its his life in us living right it's a life that's limp so if we're free that'll be manifested in our lives won't be bound by bound by a depression oppression guilt you know our past whatever it may be we're free hallelujah now brother babe seizing the token their token today's the Holy Ghost he says listen take heed we just trample on easy think he's so loving a young fellow said the other day God loves me so well God is a good dog that is true but he's a God of anger - he's a God of judgment he's a god of Wrath we fail to get that you make him so good til you make him some old dhoti grandpa I mean he's not an old dirty grandfather he's God Almighty and it doesn't have no grandchildren he has sons and daughters of God I mean not shook hands and adopted and you must be born again and the blood applied it's the sons and daughters of God not some old soft grandfather leaders kids his grandchildren give by with anything he's not a grandfather he's a father yes sir every child must be born of him and he's a father of Correction and when he corrects he has our best interest in mind he's not cruel Brady has our best interest in mind and the problem is people do not understand God's love they think people think and Israel thought that God's love should be like a love I like parental care where a parent does not want their children to get into any trouble do you want to see your children get hurt I'm glad I didn't hear an Amen otherwise we'll have pray straight away but God is not like that you say well how's it so I'll just read this now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he seem the tribulation no he doesn't he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wondered if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches as people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 and 1 2 3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you say the Lord yet you say word has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care and the same God and the autism is the same God in the new and Paul speaks about Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated and the new you tease me people misunderstand it right God's love is an election I've chosen you before the foundation of the world I chose you you've been a you've been predestinated and to the adoption of sons hallelujah and that's why it's so glorious brother Isaac song you chose me hallelujah how do I know he loves me because he chose me and if he chose me he's called me and his Corby's justified me if he's testified me he's already glorified me who feel a charge to God's elect that's probably justified romans 8 if you're anywhere I'm going hallelujah amen what can separate us from the love of God in Christ amen persecution tribulation sword famine whatever nothing hallelujah amen but what God sees that his love was elective the proof was love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact we were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul wasn't expecting your hallelujah from them he may commit you to suffering as he did joke that is his prerogative his sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strengthened settled hallelujah I mean so after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect let's be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength he put strength in us job 23 be in the I mean 6 in the beep oh you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8 2:9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey Him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection he has our best interest in mind because he has your perfection in mind hallelujah but why did he want this James 1:2 to for my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing alleluia I'm glad for tribulation that's a funny thing to say isn't it but God God's love as he leadeth hallelujah I'm glad he chose me now jesus said oops Jesus says in John 15 I am the true vine the true vine right so if there's a true vine then there has to be a false farm but I'm going to talk about the false phone talk about the truth I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit who feels like they've been perched Oh amen now ye are clean through the word which I spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye no cat no more can ye except ye abide in me so the true vine will produce a true life amen the Spirit of Truth is the life of the truth as I say it's more than a collection of ideas it's a person right so the Spirit of Truth is the life of the truth the fruit produced shows what seed that was planted originally now I used to work for a lab here in Wellington they had a seed lab up in Palmerston North and people are trained to study seeds see how pure a bunch of seeds are Joe crops they so if people buy barley they won't barley they don't want to have a feel the pumpkins and have a feel the valley that they bought a kg of barley seeds or whatever they want barley now to the untrained eye a lot of seeds actually look quite similar and the best way for us to see and the simplest proof is really to plant it and see what's made because you may have two very similar looking seats but one can be a watermelon one can be a turnip I don't know you know but could be very two different kinds of life but yet it could look the same so the fruit produced shows what the seed was that was planted right by your fruits you shall know them sir by their fruits you shall know what life is in them okay now if true bible seed is planted in the right ground it will produce the same life I'm not talking about stony ground you know grout yo Jesus gave the parable of the four types of ground I'm talking about the good ground the prepared ground right if true bible seed is planted in the right ground it will produce the same life amen it will howl ouya it will now if that is this if if that is so then that is a good way you know the truth right because the truth the spirit of truth is in you manifesting the truth right the truth of the scripture we are living epistles written on of all men if you follow Darwin you become a living epistle of Darwin right and people will see the life you live shows what you believe amen it'll show you say well you're a Christian they'll say well what do you believe you should be able to say follow me around amen when Jesus was preaching the sermon on the mount listen to the meek and the peacemakers and all these things he's describing the attributes of the of God's children I mean what the life that will live out of them hallelujah and so now we want to you shall know the truth you know a you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the Spirit of Truth is the life of the truth now this is in the token again in shreveport now that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible for any persons out from under the blood not one no matter who it was he was not responsible all had to take not only himself but his whole family their only safe when the token was displayed you cannot feel safe until the token is displayed that's right you must come under this token God's holy spirit and it displaced you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives in you amen as I said last night and up in New York one of the messages I told you that if Shakespeare lived with me I'd do the works of Shakespeare because I couldn't help it I'm no more myself I'm did Shakespeare and I can't live together in here Shakespeare was a poet I'm a minister we can't live together but if I am did to myself then and Shakespeare lives in me the works of Shakespeare I'll do the life of Shakespeare in me will be lived out like Shakespeare if the life of Beethoven's was in me I'd be like Beethoven right if the life of John Dillinger was in me I'd be John Dillinger that's right and if the life of Jesus Christ lives in the person they become identified with him its Christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power hallelujah not a not a church system not a church man but a resurrected power the truth is a resurrection power hallelujah it's the Holy Spirit is a token upon you and your life says Amen to every scripture the promise is written in here and you are not yourself no more your Christ's I'm glad I'm Christ glory you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say I think you have no thought coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the works that was in crisis in you Christ himself as in you you're dead your life was hid in God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Ghost you're not your own he was not responsible for anybody the whole family must be brought into and the token must be displayed it had to be if it wasn't displayed then there was of none effect you could believe in it you could say yes I believe it but that didn't do it well I'll tell you what I'll do I'll put it in a bucket I'll sit it over here against the wall but really I think as long as I have it here if I have the blood over here he says no sir you can't be a secret boy about it no sir you've got to have it you've got to have it on display so it's no good just saying I believe in the Holy Ghost it's got to be in you living out I mean the life that was on Calvary that came out of the body of Jesus the blood cell was broken his life was released has to come into a people that's whatever they have Pentecost the life that was in him was released and it came into 120 hallelujah and they weren't themselves anymore God was in them God was manifesting in them the life they now lived they lived by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah and it's the same thing today he was that true token shows us that he never that he ever never will fail to honor his tokens if Jesus don't come for 10,000 years you have the token he's still got to honor it no matter how many things changes whatever more he's got to honor that token he said God would all right weeks we expect us now to display his token over our god-given faith he says to every unbelieving cult in the nation in the world that believes that signs and wonders don't follow the believers and be true to this token it shows that the fear has been paid and you've been accepted for the resurrection that the token life inside of us he says that's a cutting message Bruce the truth that's what we need is truth god help us to know truth you shall know the truth of the truth shall make you free I claim that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe that God gives the Holy Ghost as a token right now just before the exodus of the bride going out of the church hallelujah and I believe the same thing I mean if the life of Shakespeare was in me I'd be sure this is more than a quote you're to think about it if the life of a Pharisee was into me I'd be a Pharisee at the life of the Spirit that were in Legion would be I'd be in the tomb right right at the life of Jesus Christ with me I do the works of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not me living anymore attend ye shall know the truth what do we need to be free from sin unbelief the works of the devil as I see the beginning we don't have to put up with him anymore we put up with him Pharaoh Pharaoh was plagued by frogs hey and here's a discussion with Moses Moses bases his windy want these frogs to go away in Ferris hid in the morning that's crazy he's by saying I want to live with this plague a few more hours who likes frogs and they beard everywhere maybe in a tank this is what he's basically saying I want to live with this plague until the morning then you can take them away that's madness it should have been can you make them go now everybody go mrs. Ferris this is Pharaoh's idea I'll just put up with this I'm not worthy to be them taken away I would advise you I'd say I'm not putting up with any more frog I'm not waiting for the morning I'm not waiting for Nick service I want them gone I want the devil gone out of my life call us to be free I mean God never made humans to be bound by the enemy he made us to walk with Him have relationship with him hallelujah walk with Him be free amen hallelujah we've received good ground we are good ground that's the seat if the seat falls in the right guard it will produce a life hallelujah I'm glad you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free we've received truth in this hour I mean whom the Sun sets free is free indeed this revealed son whom he sets free is free indeed we've been set free hallelujah now how're we doing I'll finish with this Hebrews 2 for as much soon as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took on the same the speaking of our Lord Jesus there through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham this is why he came to destroy the works of the devil there are people who were bound by fear fear of death would be liberated hallelujah this was this was his purpose of coming to destroy the works of the devil right he might destroy him that had power of death that is the devil right before God comes into a person's life they're afraid of death they don't know where where am I going to end up if time should go on life leaves this body where am I going to go and people in this in Syria they have all kinds of different religions trying to gain some you know brownie points with God but God doesn't want to stare brownie points that's not his salvation God comes down he paid the price we accept the price that life comes into us and it lives out the victory totally that's what the Holy Ghost is to do manifest the victory of the Cross in you how are you glad that we can dance over the devil wall today hallelujah we can rejoice we can be free I mean we don't need to be bound right by any such thing amen he whom the son has set free is free indeed now Jesus was manifested in the flesh the truth was manifested in the flesh and this would and the point of this was to destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil now God isn't just wasn't just manifested in Jesus right God was manifested in 120 in the upper room all the way down through the New Testament era God was manifested God came in the flesh to destroy the works of the devil right God put his body upon the earth and he used that body to destroy the works of the devil are you following me right now where is his body today right here's the head that right is the body right he comes down into you to destroy the works of the devil in your life hallelujah that now when you meet him you're not afraid you're not you know you know yeah you've been delivered he's been delivered I mean it says in Ephesians 2 yo you once walked according to the spirit of the world the Prince of the power of the air you once walked according to him the devil the devil was the throne of your heart once upon a time you were born that way the devil was in control of your life you're a slave to him a slave doesn't enjoy being a slave as many times well I remember from my passos you know I'm never doing that again and like a pig to its wallow dog to its moment you jump back in because he's a nature and you have a pig or a dog the thing you puked out that you know made you vomit you began to eat that thing up like why you know you see a dog do that kind of thing you think why would you do that it's because they're a scavenger they are predators but they'll eat whatever they can eat amen we had a Labrador growing up in Gisborne we were there at the beach and a man was sitting up hooks to go fishing he just he jumped up the bait he had these fish hanging over his mouth why because he's a scavenger he's looking for food you think why would you do that and then there's vomit then they eat the vomit you think well why would you do it the thing that made you sick you try and eat it again why would you do such a thing it's cuz it's part of their nature you can't help it now God doesn't reform us he doesn't patch us up and this is not seven steps to maybe overcoming maybe not it's not that it's transforming power and then where God makes us new creatures and then when you creation we're not a pet separation we're a new creation Tolu that we are new people I mean that's why Paul said the life I now Luke he never used to live that come up with life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God he lived by the faith of us a Pharisee intellectual conception he didn't live their faith anymore he didn't live that life anymore he was new that's how it should be this is not a patch-up center I mean the church is not here just to patch you up and put you in a ward someplace this place is to heal and restore whole ouya and redeemed that's why God's furnace here to heal and to restore intervene well that's what the trenches to do hey you may have to sit in the bed for a while this thought you know this is not palliative care there's not a place of palliative care this is a place of of transformation once coming crippled and sick and near spiritually dying I mean God takes his word I mean shucks your heart to life how do I come back to yourself my hair I'm alive I nearly died how did I get here I don't know but I'm living Chucky's back to life I thank God for a mighty angel descending I thank God for coming down among us earlier you shall know the truth the truth of the pressure he's not some abstract idea he's a living beating hallelujah amen so God comes down he manifests himself in your flesh that the power of the works are destroyed the power of the devil is destroyed rather and now we're free and then now here you are he says have I've been since I sinned are you oh yeah so now you've got a job you've got a commission you've got a commission go into all the world preach the gospel you say well I'm not a preacher live it live this word that when people see you they read Peter James and John they read the Gospels they read the book of Hebrews they read the book of Revelation and then they read the book of Ruth the book of Esther polio they read all those they read the scripture they read the Psalms I see it in you hallelujah go into all the world live this word cast out the devil wherever you'll find him divine love is stronger than any work of the enemy the enemy is defeated that damned Calvary was he defeated could the grave hold our Lord could he hold him could those soldiers could the earth will seal the term up oh that's a good idea so I think it's insanity I just think of Lazarus four days in the grave Lazarus come forth and if he didn't say that Jesus and said that word Lazarus it would have been a January's erection because this is I am the resurrection and the life and then here comes Lazarus out of the tomb and then the scribes and Pharisees they say we have to kill him cause those testimonies making people believe that's insanity but that's how people are again the soldiers they seal the tomb up then they begin to you know no doubt the high priests and the Pharisees like that's the last we see of this Jesus of Nazareth that's all done how how wrong they were oh we need a center it mean to seal this thing oh yeah they'll keep them good luck devil then here the soldiers we have to stop this one coming what are our orders sir keep this body in this tomb why is here an army gonna come there's a lot of us here oh no these these disciples how are they with their swords well one one tried to kill a guy the only manage to cut his ear off what's their background fishermen tax collectors what do you mean guys with office jobs you know are they physically strong woman at the well you may find a bunch of woman sir yes sir we're gonna guard this thing God the devil can't stop God's life he's a God is unstoppable nothing can stop him and there and they're there guarding and in first day nothing you're on the lookout second day nothing did looking at the wrong thing because Angel Lord is gonna deceive they should have been looking up oh yeah and then God comes down there's your Lord the Saints they fall over like dead men the stone rolls away and then he walks out oh yeah oh yeah and now brother Bram says what a resurrection that was and but then he says well the resurrection this is where our people who once dead in trespasses and sins have come alive other that they're living people I mean it's like this world tried to put you in a tomb tomb of religion tomb of the world tomb in your mind of reason whatever ball do you think the devil could keep you there he couldn't stop Jesus he couldn't stop the disciples he couldn't stop the truth through the Dark Ages he couldn't stop the Reformation he stop though outpouring of Azusa Street he couldn't stop the messenger he won't stop the bride hallelujah I know I passed from death to life hallelujah oh do you feel it all the time no I believe it and he confirmed my faith Amen it's like abraham believed he's given the sign of circumcision to prove that he believed we believe god cuts off all the excess everything that's not part of the problem let's just cut away holy he gives us a seal of the Holy Ghost I need the proof that he's received a fake just take him at his word so now here we are what is he God's Word which destroys the work well at least out from them here he says now God's taking from there holding out a bunch to make a ministry just exactly like the word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up now Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that now I can't explain all this and but he says God was manifested to destroy that works of the devil amen he says what was God God's Word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to do that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is the head and the body together hallelujah the devil couldn't stop and then and then I'll just you know the devil cannot stop you no weapon formed against thee shall prosper you have to look you're gonna get a think about it what is stopping the Word of God manifested in my life what is stopping it it would be baptism Holy Ghost coming in whatever it may be real salvation that's all that brother cadre preaching are you saved that's more than just giving a confession have you been redeemed has his life coming to you and manifesting it out hallelujah you think what is stopping me manifesting the word it's not God there's only two spirit is the Christ and the endtime cry against this one lives produces life this one's against what is stopping you manifest me would it's the devil not God so if I was you this let's just stand let's have the musicians but I would just purpose in my heart I'd say Lord he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed I've continued in your word I am your disciple I don't want to put up with the enemy anymore I mean it some love Lord this morning easy to sit free who's free who's been made free hallelujah who's not bound you know god you have to confess it I mean you have to believe he saved you yes you can't say well I'm white no you say thank you Lord for saving me and then he and then he backs up your confession say thank you Lord for making me worthy thank you Lord for cleansing me thank you Lord for setting me free thank you Lord for filling me with your Holy Spirit thank you for making me free indeed you have to confess it he's waiting for you to say thank you Lord that you've done this for me that's what it wants to stop your voice that's why I say it's don't shout don't rejoice don't say thank you don't be happy because you have to respond to God amen do we we have that song thank you thank you Lord for saving me you came into my life and set me free hallelujah once I was lost but now I am found now my soul is
