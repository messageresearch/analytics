mean if you want to stand with me and take your take your Bibles we're gonna turn to Genesis chapter 24 we're going to read a couple of well well familiar scriptures are I'm sure to us all if we go to Genesis 24 and we're gonna read verses 61 down to 64 and then we're going to turn to Ephesians chapter 2 so Genesis 24 and and verses 61 to 64 do you want to say Amen or wave your hand or I mean when you are when you are there amen since so let's forget the read here it says and Rebekah rose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebekah and winters way and Isaac came from the way of the well llama Rory for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the Eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel I mean let's just go to Ephesians chapter 2 we're gonna read from verse 1 down to verse 6 I mean so Ephesians 2 in in in verse 1 I mean say mean or wave your hand with you there amen amen praise the Lord Amen hallelujah I mean Ephesians 2 and 1 and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins weird in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the mind and of the desires of the flesh of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who's Richard mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and now now know where we have gone so we've gone from being under the spirit of this world but then we've been quickly made alive and we've been moved the Lord has moved us and has raised us up together too and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus a means this is bow hits in a word of Prayer this morning dear Lord Jesus truly father we long to worship you give you glory Lord for everything you've done for us in our doing and we want to thank you for this hour that we're alive had Lord it's the most exciting time to be alive Lord that their Lord because there's a people upon the earth that will not taste death but they'll walk from this world into the next and father I just pray dear God as we have read your word Lord oh lord I just pray you and just take the service Lord Jesus under your control Lord may you anoint not only to speak about the hearer Lord may you be very real in every home Oh God may be very presently Lord may your by the atmosphere you now be changing your law maybe be like a holy hush come into every place Oh God father because we know where you are little the supernatural is happening and anything could happen in your presence our God so father may we all have a welcoming heart Lord Jesus to receive you and welcome you Father and so main come by our way today Lord may be very pressed or may be very real law - may you anoint the service father feel glorious Lord may you just have Lord may just have preeminence every life we just want ask you to forgive us of all about wrongs and our sins and our whole lives be covered under your blood the devil can't work no place Lord of Maine just receive all honor glory and praise from the service grinder please Lord we committed into your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning I mean it's good to see each and every one of you today I mean better but if I could if I could take a um if I could take a subject I would I want to speak about being closer to heaven than here this is my subject being being closer to heaven than here and you know we read in Genesis 24 that you know Rebecca made her journey to to marry Isaac and I just want to focus on the part you know because we know that the the wedding happens here the Union happens here you know we go here to the in supper you know you know you know by a rapture but you know there's also we are going on a journey from this world to the next world and so I want to take that part of Rebecca's journey where she left where she lived where she was born and then she was transported she was taken from from from there to her future home it's just like the same way we are being transported we're being taken I mean from this world to the next world so you know we are on our way from here to glory I mean whose good think it's I mean I'm I'm a pilgrim I'm traveling through this land hallelujah I mean so but I really pray that the Lord would make this real personal today you know I don't want this to be some abstract thing some kind of new thought of different angle but I want this to be a reality and I prayed it you know as this lockdown has been going on that the wood has become more personals become more real and it's all from theory to to to reality and there's God's from abstract to to material you know it's not a not as an idea you know we're not here you know we don't for this message like like we sit in some University Hall and he lecture after lecture believe me I've been there I can help be there listening to lecture out the lecture and you cram for an exam and then after the exam you forget most of what you've learned this is not how this works I mean we're walking with the Living God I mean he's molding and shaping us amen he's taking us from this world to the next world I mean but it's just like with you know Rebecca when she was born to wish she went to is quite a distance you know just just googling and searching you look on the map it's about 500 miles there's not just a day journey it's not just like I get my car and I could come see any of you you know 500 miles by camels quite a long way Oh amen but but I want you to notice now that the same how she got there was not herself walking me right she didn't go on foot and walk those 500 miles you know because when we when we when we talk about we're you know we're walking with God as he not walking with God from this world to the next world you know the nipple like to try and twist it in our mind saying well now what do we have to get their tribe you following me I'm in but but I want you to notice that the sand camel she wanted by the well we're exactly the same camels that took her to her eyes that came in so wasn't her walking there but the same power the same camel she watered and it took her from from from where she was born to her future her hallelujah I mean so you know we wanna you know song I'm just gonna call it a follower you know this thing I mean sometimes believers can get in such a twist is just by comments sometimes believers can get in such a twist okay we're on a journey from this world and we're going to take a rapture to the next world but we you know we you know it won't be that anybody did all that for me in spite of me you lived amen so this may be very obvious and and and I've seen it before but this may be very obvious but those camels that pecked her there those camels picked her there they carried her she didn't walk herself they carried her amen and brother Brad was saying show us the father and we've seen the father in the cell hallelujah he says now the Lord Jesus bless you help you he says I love you and God loves you God wants you to get well God and His creation you believe it God in His Word you believe it God was in his son you believe it God indeed himself in Jesus Christ you believe it God emptied himself into the church is that right being God's and his word gods and his creation God's and his son and God as in his people do you believe it in Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever is that right what he did then he can do now is that right we love him we believe him we've got we got soles magnetized with power tonight that'll take us in the rapture I mean the Holy Ghost I mean now soldiering mega times of the power then I'll take us in the rapture oh my I think of that beautiful Rebecca that afternoon watering the camels watering the very thing was going to take her I mean that's what it was watering the camels represents power and the Church of Living God today is rejoicing and watering the power of the Holy Ghost that'll pick up some day and take your yonder to meet the Isaac in the air for the winning stuff a hallelujah a means do you believe it I mean to the same cow I mean so just as that you said that camels represented the Holy Ghost she watered it with praise amen and giving it glory I mean that same power from that place where her bridegroom was and the holy guys that we have her seat we'll carry out orders from this world to the next world be gone forever hallelujah amen isn't that wonderful I mean whoa does that mean we sit back and I say well no if the Lord is in your heart you'll do like the Apostle Paul did what did the Apostle Paul do that's a good question and I'm glad I've got the answer for that question he's in Philippians 3 and 12 not as our ha I have already obtained neither were already perfect that we know that perfect is fully mature but I follow after if that I make every him that's which also I am every handed off Christ Jesus so Paul's gold he was gripped by something I mean he he was on the road to Damascus and he met the log and then and it gripped them I mean the Lord had prohibitive grab them seize them and then to his whole life's ambition now was every hint that which had apprehended her I mean this is the thing that he was wanting to do I mean that this this is what he wanted this was his hostas ire I mean that he would get ahold of God as God had got ahold of him amid so now this way isn't that why we read the world I mean isn't that why we listen to the we pray I mean that we would every and we'd get a hold of this goddess got a hold of us man it's not that you know Lord I want more of you I mean you've got a hold of me and now I want to get a hold of you that your mayor hostas I mean to the thing we wore I'm in this powered water without praise and our worship is the work you know you know as the wood comes up and what happens it just generates a praise out of our lives I mean I was thinking and maybe I'll come with the this is in the future sometime but I've been pondering them on John's response to the book coming open now to me it's you know you know it's not about the volume of a shot though he had a shout yeah but but it wasn't like he he took some notes and say that's a good thought but something came out of his life when he's little lamb' advice from glory and take the book and open the seals and it should be the same thing when the word comes out but that you generated praise they made she generated glory and you such a worship I mean it's not just a new idea or wasn't mad and I saying but it was sold that way before he began to praise God was becoming material what uncalibrated was now going to be fully complete amen in terms of he purchases bride now he's come to redeem his bride means letting you know the very power I mean this that's why I would give God glory hallelujah why because we're watering that power I mean we're wondering the camels they mean that same cow that the world is going to peck us into the next world I see it's not trying to use our own human effort to earn it earn something now this may sound a bit ridiculous but this just how I wrote it down and you know I don't mean to be joking but sadly many are trying to learn their way dress modestly enough their way listen their way into getting some favor with God that he will then move on their behalf you know it's kind of like people having a - kind of like a reward system you know it's like getting brownie points with God who's following made you understand what I mean it's like people evident they buy they do something thank God is all the guys to do something in return it's just kind of like her look system is how people are subconsciously you know so just let I earn five brownie points with God then they're entitled to a small healing God you on because I prayed this much I read this might try study this cut oh maybe you are didn't in brownie points with God then you get a big healing I prayed more and I I studied more I booked us again tomorrow I dress this way born what is it trying to add something right all 50 points is of deliverance because God you owed me now I made a thousand points in the one ticket safe but this sounds ridiculous but it said we have some people up they think I have done this fearful God you owe me goodness knows nothing amen and sadly they do not see by the revelation of the powers of the world God has done all we just need to walk in the victory hallelujah Amen see you know Rebecca just got on the camel she made a decision Oh God and she went Medici got to a place in her and her journey wish she was closer to her future Hartman to her previous home the Lea so so sadly maybe do not see that see see faith seat see faith is a revelation it's not something you study out now I just want to say I'm not against study I'm not against spending time looking at courts looking at scriptures i I'm all for that okay so I want you to understand I'm not against those things but if that's what we depend upon to take a rapture sadly we're going to be least behind amen it's not that's not how much we know I mean to me I mean that that will change our bodies Mitch we're we're face receives the word and the dynamics the Holy Ghost coming to a person and that will transform this mortal body I mean so so it's not about trying to get some kind of breath the weather stares rubbing my brownie points consciously think they have to do enough I'm just looking down as well look at the camera looking at you I mean you know you know weird understand it's not us trying to learn something with God I mean grace obtains the problems faith is a revelation sadly many people do that because they have not actually grossed the revelation of the power of the blood that is released upon the scene part right through the entire message a because the entire message takes us back to the scripture Texas back to the unadulterated Word of God remember basics did not come to replace this you're following me the message to talk to him to replace the Bible the message came to establish this is the Word of God this has a power I mean when this is received into a heart of faith I mean it'll move mountains I mean so sorry so the message reveals Christ in the scripture it's very important we need to see this message in the scripture I mean because the mises came to reveal Christ in the scripture but it doesn't replace the Bible I mean it just actually places the Bible in its correct place hallelujah amen amen say see when you see I mean so I mean I mean I was just in tears I was having such a good time to sing brothers when you see that it was all seen on that day on Calvary I mean that the blood of God was in the life of God that was that was in him now comes into the believer I mean by the shed blood and you begin to see I mean before the wood was just think on paper I mean before became real I mean always just quotes or just books or tapes or just [Music] such a fight and produces such a fight I mean when you see it smaller the story it's more than even a brother preaching better voice but the voice behind the voice begins to grip your soul I mean hallelujah oh my when he comes I mean personally to you and tell you child the books open prevail I've heard this young only so I just get excited hallelujah I'm in MCS jomkwan Manas division represents a whole body of people I mean this one says dog is the collective thing that the lamb takes the book and Joe's a seeing it all happen it's going to become a reality tear listener produces such a faith like I say even when you recognize it the black payroll that produces such a face in your life Holly I produced such a piece I made such a joy nothing held against me hallelujah amen and that face you begin to see working in your life what kind of faith is it isn't just human faith nas got this human face Paul Paul would write to the Galatians an end and he was speaking to a people that have been derailed by legalism he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God I live by the faith of the Son of God we say what's happening you find yourself to be closer to there than here amen Hebrews 11 and I didn't steal this off sister Lundy's our Sunday schools already of my notes now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which has seen are not made of things which to appear by faith aid offered so you know I just want to stop there I don't need a big documentary series to explain creation to me I don't need Sun look I work in the field of science so I can kind of say this I don't need science to prove me that God created the world's my faith I understand it right I received a revelation I understand he made the world world class work amen I find Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and putting out he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God so his faith I know I've seen this before but his faith took him in a rapture my faith Enoch was translated so saw his faith translated him right you follow me that's like a part we need to come visit you now by my car I came and visited you I was translated from my address to your address because my car took me there hallelujah so his faith took them from this world to the next world and the scripture tells us he walked with God and was not so he was just walking he entered into a relationship with God and he just began to walk with God but they came a day in his life where he realized that he was a shape change human shape from a mold until you look more heavily more like the earthly injecting us I need to look more like the world and even by the blood room creation so that we we not be in the Himalayan sea of the earthly though we may be still at least by sufficiently change but I betcha I mean our character because what happens we getting closer to heaven and to the earth hallelujah his faith translated him now and he had this testimony there before his translation he pleased God now we just read we just read in Hebrews I'm sorry I texted an extra for that faith but I'm going to come back to Enoch it's impossible to please him he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so Enoch space took him in a rapture but then Paul would begin to write without faith it's impossible to please him so in our ability we cannot please God it takes faith to please him right so without faith it's impossible to please him but I'll say with the faith of the Son of God and you it's impossible not to please go hey maybe he's going to take the vice versa right I mean we live by the faith of the Son of God the bride does Amen so now with faith it's impossible Lisa sure we have our ups and downs of disappointment whatever but it's all part of our journey yes and even I think it was brother I'm speechless hit it and just place me so well even many things that we bet that God delivers us from he allows us to remember those things and those things are still in our mind not to condemn us and keep us down but that we remain thankful that we were delivered from them louia so sure we have our ups and downs every but we're walking with God before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God now automatically people were going to think now how can I have a taste for that pleases God because I'm going to get into condition then I'm rapture ready yeah the brides in rapture condition all right but it's not our own ability I just want to I just want to kick them I just want to kick what he calls supports out of human ability the way I've seen I've seen a perfect streets of perfect weakness he said one thing we must master is our own human ability but you can actually master than the fact it's not your human human ability that can actually produce the promises of God so I thought I just want to kick that thing down or maybe beat on it for a while yes I mean because we have to we have to understand it's not it's not us and our ability okay now okay so I better have a taste right it pleases God so I need to have a certain demeanor and I need to treat people a certain way and be happy with me and I've got a dream you know I'm all for holiness living I believe the Holy Ghost makes you live holy but people what they do is we're gonna kind now I need to have you know they try and maintain you everything in their own strength how's my prayer life doing it so long enough am I reading enough it might have my personal time I'm not against any of those things but but but they try and maintain this I've got to achieve the standard of Christian living you know he'll know my is my skirt to the floor now it's not it should be to the floor hold out now now I'm getting into condition because it becomes a legal thing right and and now I have the quotes for every question but everything hold together cross at the eyes and you know because he his life in the world I'm gonna be translated Jesus was asked the question what shall we do that we might work the works of God that's a good question because fielding well I'm gonna I'm going to get in this condition I'm going to have a teacher that I please God my behaviors going to be a certain way and I get upset at anything nothing bothers made I'm just in this crowd of serene kind of state and you know everything's fine and and I have no sickness I have no worry I have no stresses I'll say this sickness will be with us till the rapture why rain will be with us till the rapture birds will be with us till the rapture they will think I'm sorry they will be what but that doesn't mean just because you're burdened or you're sick or you worry about something that doesn't mean you're not going in a resurrection amen yeah so we just need to we just need to take all the you know take all those things put them to one side see because the devil puts it on us or you've got to worry you've got a burden maybe you're sick in your body you have this or you're not reps you're ready since when is it actually your those things will actually get your reps ready or not yeah I mean if it was then the problem would just preach human psychology he didn't preach human psychology and he preached rapturing faith in the world I mean sighs oh Jesus what shall we do that we might do the works of God and jesus answered and said unto them and is it well now now did he say you better be in every service I believe in that you better dress room obviously I believe you know we should your dress immodestly oh you better pray now every day read your Bible I mean you better listen to all the tapes you better have all the doctrine down packed no did anyone read that in the Bible let's have some people are on their mind right right he said this is the work of God he's gonna answer it they'ii believe on Him who he has seen I didn't believe this word bleep it this is how you do the work I mean this is how I believe in us and works it Bob he believes the word she believes the work and she believes that word and it changes I mean someone who sees they believe it in there's no change I don't know I kind of doubt the faith a men I thought you actually believed the word and they act upon the word they have World Bank hallelujah so we need to believe on Him whom he has see a men hallelujah no I'm just gonna jump back into Philippians how how Paul said I'm going after him that which has apprehended me and then the next thing he sees breather I count not myself to have apprehended so our pool was still trying to grab this one I believe their entire lives who wants more Jesus I meant I don't believe you'll be a time where we ever get satisfied when we think we have it all we just want more the more you have the more you want the more you have the more you walk and then the more you have them you know you just keep wanting more what's more tell us the reality of God merely wants a way to become flesh your name he wants all the promises of God and in workers the reason is because there's something that you were apprehended hallelujah but this was see see brethren I taught myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do now the Apostle Paul says this one thing I do I want to listen to what he does and I want to say I want to do what he did I mean forgetting those things which are behind so this is the one thing he does behind and reaching forth unto those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I preached towards the mark of the full of prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus this was Paul's ambition this was her sure manifested and begin apostles a bigger profit messenger to the aged and all those things but but the same the same desire should be in every believer I mean that we forgive the things which in the past and we're pressing on let's keep pressing on church okay man let's not slip back and say well five years ago this place off hallelujah so they came at time and her journey wish you and I'm going to make to Rebecca now there was actually a time in her journey where she was actually closer to her future home then the home she was raised and now I just want to I don't I just have a couple of slides here I trustee everyone's following me and I trust there's something in you that says he's talking about me and you know the Lord is good I think we can rejoice now now who can see that this is the court now those equations answers number 3 1964 remember Isaac had lived the Tina was standing out in the field meditating in the late afternoon amen when he saw a bigot coming and she had never seen him he'd never seen her but it was love at first sight she fell in love with him and he was happy and she was even Val they made oh my and look when she seen him her heart was so full of joy she didn't know who she was going to marry but by faith amen and remember Jesus will leave the kingdom and will not meet him in glory will where to meet him in the air between heavens and earth where it's expanded to redeem us and he met Rebecca in the middle between her home and his high-minded took her into his home and married her and tell it everything has father had a mean are perfect just perfect alright so he sees that we're gonna meet the Lord halfway between here and there right where heaven has come and expanded down to redeem us now we know redemption is where God purchases our salvation any times to claim us again to get a hold of us so heaven is expanded and and I just want to meditate on the stolen but heaven has expanded to redeem us probably so hippin is actually extended itself out I need to get a hold of us now we not think of heaven expanding to redeem us I think of lucky nations at war now this picture here is a as I am it's from world war two and it's a prisoner of war camp which i think has just been liberated I mean but but we know think of heaven expanding to redeem us I think it's like nation is at war and and and that nation is beginning to expand its territory taking enemy land and as it's doing that it's looking to do two things number one is looking to engage the enemy and destroy it but also looking for its own forces that have been previously taken captive and present I mean of the devil but then God you see the you know you know you see the faces of these men here but they're happy why because I see deliverance is coming very much they look like this without mice into that prison camp in the beginning they would be down and serious and fear defeated in there and the shoulders hanging down and said I always stuck Carol you know why can't we be free and we want to fight the war whatever war but you know when when they're our side time to get them halia and turned their faces from Doncaster rejoicing why cuz here was their liberation our I mean why because you could say that I mean expanded it their territory and they were driving their enemies out but also driving the enemy up but also rescuing redeeming those hadn't ordered previously taken captive by the enemy hallelujah glory to God sorry so this is what has happened to his friends we have been liberated and also that liberation now what happens is those prisoners of war what would either happiness is that would be either rehabilitated and put back into the fighting forces or they would be set free to be well what's happened you know and then and then I you know I want to point this out to if you aren't going just say you know you know you are taking to me territory and you see a prison camp there and you are armed forces of there you don't leave that prison camp hold it up you go liberate the thing I mean but you're looking for your on side right you're looking for your arm on comrades you're looking for the same rods with the same kind of uniform as your hallelujah as the same thing heaven expanded because God is looking for his attributes I mean God is upon the earth and in liberating his attributes now we are the attributes of God in flesh amen I mean and we didn't become that father give birth we already were us I meant we already were as attributes I mean but the Holy Ghost indeed breath I mean just polkas attributes alive right so here they are I mean and and they're here I need to liberate all of their own forces and they not gonna lead one who's behind it's exactly the same with God human has expanded that upon the earth to meet us and Inter Dimas and he has done the same in that he's not really one who's behind he's not gonna leave a single attribute upon the earth he's gonna find every member of the bride hallelujah yes they were all in a prison of sadness or loneliness of torment of sickness ah celebration is here now I wanna I just wanna I'm just gonna leave that picture up a bed sore eyes now amen that's exactly the same in this battle it's a contest between God and Satan going on who does is it caught this guy everyone has expanded to redeem II every attribute of God upon the earth that's why this message is gone round the world hallelujah that's exactly that's exactly mother man has a story of mama eagle she knew she knew she had two eggs but but but one time when she was off hunting a farm you know the store a well book but let's just go they because it makes me happy I mean so you know you know farmer goes gets one of the eggs takes it puts it down to the chicken cook and then and then finally eat that yo you know that that baby eagle hatches and he opens his eyes he has no idea what he is they give us a look around me Caesar he sees his mama well thinks it's his mother as a hidden you know you know his brothers and sisters old little chickens and he and he follows him tries to mimic armor and eat worms and eat corn but doesn't says fires you know he just feels he doesn't fit it because no reflection but in all this time when he's in that prisoner of war camp and that time when he's born into that slavery trying to be like a chicken mama knew that she had another attribute Amy because she because she had two internet repeats and what was hence one was flying one was fledgling but she wasn't satisfied just with one coming to birth coming to its position I mean she had a burden I had another eight subway and she because o open a big great big wings fly into the hip atleast and then she's looking and she's flying she's looking there's a bird another hot seat she's a mama bird on her hop we said other ink whiz another attribute and she saw a slapping to the flap into the sky and then her eyes looked down at a place and she sees a chicken yeah but one of those chickens does not look like a chicken because now she's thinking is this black chick what's happening outside I mean heaven expanded I made that Eagle you could say its character I expanded over that chicken cook was that one thing in mind I want my places we gonna fly the chicken yeah to be good to scream with that Eagle spring I mean because they in regard to claim an edge should be just like that mother Eagle I mean her territory expanded until she found that one and then they went up in DeHaven Lee places I just want to point out something as I said that there's a call this between God and Satan this is God's battle this is God's battle I mean face phase following this is God's battle he's in Sound City for medal singing at the inter-service I don't know but this is this poor man cried Sam City for verse 6 and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles I mean how God is a God of deliverance I mean our God is a God of Liberty Sam City 4 verse offside as verse 6 now now verse 7 I think the angel of the lord encamps around them that fear him and lower thing losing kent by the angel of god and then he delivers us from all our fears I mean sounds 34:19 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of being all they say that o Lord you have got me out of my all my afflictions I mean any may be my affliction - love me out of them all hallelujah I mean I love the story of this in second chronicles and chapter 20 and and it's going to be a battle between King Jehoshaphat and and Israel and his enemies and and and they begin together they don't know how they're gonna fight this battle within a season in verse 14 and the Spirit of the Lord is in the midst of the congregation so God's going to give it us that's why it's all water death right atmosphere and how harmless unplugged at the right atmosphere in church I've been to spirit alone with common come among the congregation because God's going to give us battle orders he's gonna show us how we're gonna win the spell hallelujah and he said verse 15 I can heal all Judah this is God speaking and II inhabitants of Jerusalem and now King Jehoshaphat listen to me that side the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of the scrap multitude for the battle is not yours but gods and because I don't be dismayed sure hell is literally indeed itself upon the earth I mean yeah it is way more demonic power and besides if it has been in any aids but don't be dismayed by their great multitude I mean because the battle is not yours I mean you're not in this walk I mean try to work later and your eyes straight your there's any demon power by your own ability I mean you know either coming by your own shake not the battles like Moses gods battle I mean when they're recognized and he's in charge of this battle holy we can try and take it our hearts tricks I mean you know but say god this is your battle hallelujah Amen he say well I'm in a great battle also humans here to fight fear I mean humans expanded to her demons our reason I can say this is because yo say it's God's battle because now here's a diagram of the spectrum of the spectrum of light now this world that we live in we only see a very small portion of this you can see there that you know cosmic rays are very small broadcast bands are cooler kilometers and hike but the visual spectrum of the light is a very small band in the middle that's in expanded in that other beauty on the bottom so we can only see a small portion of light and that shows us actually that that most of the world that we live in is actually unseen right there's actually a very small person posture of the squirrel directly in contact with that doesn't mean it's not there right radio waves are here I can't see them I mean you know gamma rays x-rays ultraviolet and for red broadcast fans radio microwaves all those things are here I can't see them it doesn't mean they're not here right I mean and it's the same thing with us now we have to recognize Amen angels are here my father's here the captain of the hosts the Lord which is the Lord Himself is prese hey man this I'm saying we're not in this bad Lord but God is with us in this battle oh I just want us to quit now is a reason why Rebecca got on that Camel there's a reason why human has expanded amen - to redeem us in the south there's a reason that that Enoch walked with God and was not because God took them there's a reason and and the reason is because they had a man a theophany body an eternal body already in the heavens for them I mean if we are part of the word we already have an eternal home waiting for us I mean Paul would say though this earthly tabernacle of this house Peter's old I have one eternal in the heavens waiting for me already right so there was actually a call there was a call from an unseen world upon their lives and I was actually drawing them amen - to their future home now brother Graham would say this this entosis mark is like he says that's the alternate is something you could not see it could be right here now you could not see it should be right here that's just like well my television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there is cows also but the eye is only subject to the five senses I mean you're hoping is only subject to the five senses rather and you and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see that's why I showed you the spectrum of life you're only limited to that little band but there is another dimension that can be seen by transpire transformation by television that television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels it into a circuit and in the television screen picks it up but the picture is there too to begin with television was here when Adam was here television was here when Elijah MC remarkable television was here when gzip nez earth walk the shores of Galilee but we just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you would have been crazy to have said something like that but now it become a reality so does crisis here the angels of God are here and some day and the greatly needed to come it will be just more real than television or anything else because they aren't here he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as here more face himself into his servants to prove himself anybody sees that all these so those things are all here televisions here even now I mean as I'm standing in my lounge speaking to you I mean you know I could be we can be having the service just just me and my family here I could be doing exactly the same thing saying exact you're saying the same things I mean and you'd never see it but because of this technology we have I mean my image in my voice is transported from my my lounge into your heart amen that's the same thing now I mean the angels of God I hear the Holy Ghost is here I mean what God gives us faith in contact at odds in world hallelujah but it's more real as as brother Baron would send either they quote I mean it's just more real than television or anything else because they are here so now we're living in this world where most of this world is actually unseen and these five senses do know declared and these five senses would all make - contacted I remember faith that sixth sense that we have has made to contact an unseen world and the reason that that we do recommend field you know the reason that that we do contact an unseen world or their unseen world contacted us is because we have a body that we're going to step into as I say now we're closer to there than here amen I mean the bride the bride has been walking right the bride has been ascending alia not just a nice idea but we're XE let me be descending I mean climbing higher each day hallelujah where where once where we started the journey maybe something would fathers and toss us around but then we overcame it but haven't we climbs a little higher I mean and then there's nothing no I climb a little higher and there is nothing we conquered a little conquer throws every climbed a little higher I mean and when we started our journey I mean you know it's just like a natural child when they born you know sometimes it's hard to say you know you heard that's all she just looks like you or he just looks like you your mom or dad and sometimes you look at the baby and you look at the fair I don't know how this is working you know you know to me but then eventually as they grow and then they begin to walk and they begin to speak Indonesian personality come out you begin to see actually there are a lot like I'm and day I met and even when they're well off in years any of the things that parents that I mean they they said character a night did you see it living in their lives because as they're walking as they were walking along last journey they become more like the seed of the gene that was in them but that life that natural efforts and then becomes manifested greater and greater way and it's the same thing with you and I mean as the wolf of God maybe when we first start a little crawling along in your yard you know whole thing along and picking up and falling down juanzi so to speak trying to get a long walk with God I mean we didn't look the whole bunch like the word right now we're not saying about looking like the word I'm not just talk about being modestly dressed right I'm doing better nature and a character that's what I'm talking about because remember this is the character of God revealed in here and this is a love leader this is the heart of God I mean reveal to you in a lovely - right and the more you read this the more you become like your lover amen right so as you walk with God I mean we've become looking more like him and what we are actually doing this because mimic God has an image of us God has an eternal body and the heavens I mean already waiting for us and he knows what it looks like now know what I'm saying well it looks like it's more than just all we look can look like we're 19 18 or 18 or whatever age it's more than just a physical look that's the character of nature he knows that he knows what nature in character we have we will have after the rapture but he knows he knows what that is so he has an image of us and the heavens and then now as we're walking with God right we become more and more like that image following more and more right so I just say you know we start walking with God at first we look like this but I'm it looks like this but as we're walking with God and God gives us one of a kind power more of his nature we surrender Marty you know fills with the Holy Ghost changes matures us stabiliser I'm stabilized I'll walk that of each lead we go from looking like this which doesn't look like an open hand there is to walk with them we become more and more and more like him I know it's a very crude illustration but but but but I'm sure you get what I mean but we just got to walk with them and love them what but the reason now the reason now we are walking with us because we have representation and hip and already now our brother man would say this is an expectation in 1954 he says he says now I mean well I'll just say this first seat we may not see we may not see the unseen but we feel it's a fix amen he says now on expectation I pray before now I'm Pentecostal or fog or Full Gospel people around the world I find them with a great faith and the reason they have faith is because they just skipped up a bit Father they have been born of the Spirit of God which is the supernatural and many people tell me brother Branham as you get older you look like you're dead well he's my dad that's the reason I look like him well now the same thing many things that we have that that we favor by a family strain like that through each other ending in the family strain of God if we become born of the Spirit ago we take on the nature God then we are his son we are the sons of God and this is where I find that the Full Gospel people has become sons and daughters of God they believe the supernatural now the other has never stepped up be performed why because they've climbed a little higher right amen so they can't believe the supernatural there's nothing to believe would see so he's saying the people who believe you just believe the supernatural The Full Gospel Church they've come a little higher then then then the others right why because they've been walking with God and so it's the same thing with us friends we've been we've been walking with him and we'll be kind of looking for life from all the time amen now have you ever um you know I'm sure during this lockdown maybe maybe you yeah you know as I say this like a we may feel the effects of the unseen realm just like brother Graham said and who's the smoke is the public was when you realize that this this message is eagle food you heard from your theophany yeah right I think I think brother Nene you said on we're on but you know you know but you heard from your theophany so you actually have this eternal body wedding in the heavens and when you recognize that this message is the word of God this eagle food then he says you've heard from that eternal home but the thing is now the thing is is but they still a dimension between us and here right we can't see our theophanies we can't see that realm as you know like brother Brad is caught up in the anointing as a and he could see from eternity to eternity all right but we're not all built that way I thought that that realm are still live Amy that realm is still there and it's still affecting this realm and to me it's kind of like you know maybe maybe you know during this lockdown you may have bumped into another believers when you've gone to the supermarket or gone somewhere but there's like so so so before when you're just going about your business amen you don't realize they're there but suddenly they appear and you and you begin to actually feel their influence in the place right because you sees that their presence is there and you know their presence there is because you can see them right now we can't see the angels we can't see God but we feel as presence come down and so we know he's here with us right so then you begin to see another believer I mean but because of the social distancing which I'm sure we've all get to know and we should you know there's still a gulf between you and them right but but they can talk to you and you can talk back to them I mean but it's kind of like now and in this world right now because of the star meets you know get amen well theophanies come close and and they begin to affect us I mean the angels of God come down God Himself comes down and we'll feel that presence I mean we we feel their effect we feel their influence hallelujah but we've got to understand it's not going to stay that way brother Branham would would would say and go awake Jesus in 1963 now I'm asking the quit no I'm answering the question maybe better nasca but you know why did why is he even expanded or how do we know heavens expanded I mean because I mean we feel the effect of that unseen world because we've got a new body to see right he says could you imagine a person that's never had the sense of sight and evidence see and you would bump against objects and you would have to derive your food from energy or some other resource but you would bump into something you have a sense of feeling but not and then all of once somebody opened their eyes up and seen a complete different world they'd never seen they had never seen anything and if then you could say well well now what should feel real woman you it's the Sun and the blood business is well what is the Sun it's a life that's a what's a life he'd never seen he'd even lived in that sense he doesn't know what it is that you bump against it's a certain thing well what's it see he never lived in that dimension at all it would be very strange to him to know it well know if God leads us look we are broadly here in five senses but there is another sense and then when we wake up into that sense and that is the sense of vision and we see that thing and what it is makes us feel these things that we do and try to tell someone about it that's like trying to tell man that never did see in his life that he wouldn't understand because he's not acquainted with that sense and that is that and that's the way it is in the gospel they don't understand it it's hard for them to see it because they never lived in there they know nothing about it they feel it and they can have a reaction to it but to actually know what it is we don't so when we can see beyond that curtain where it comes from and then try to come back and tell the people that's on the Felda with the seeds of feeling well never being able to see it aside to tell a man but you just have to do the best you can until we all see face to face I mean is like the throat towards a whole other world that's there but you've got to have a siege to contact that world now we have bits of faith now brother man would speak about and in quite a few places I mean we're we're eternity he says you don't understand and now because you're just bumping into us so basically we're just walking along this life we notice that heaven to God do we know there's a rapture to take I mean we know there's a God whose name is the Lord Jesus Christ we know he's redeemed us I mean but that eternal realm is influencing us constantly but it's like we can't see you just kind of bump into it amen and it bumps into you and it influences you and he and he says that quite a few times about you know that thing that you're bumping into it ought to say that condemns you when you're wrong you know he says it's actually it's actually eternity bumping into you or rather you were bumping into it you know these cannot come a time and and maybe I'll just close with this thought I remember to Rebekah we don't know journey and she got to a place that she was closer to there than here and heaven expanded Justine's brother Browns woods heaven expanded or he even has expanded to redeem us right so at first I mean when when Rebecca first got on the camel maybe the draw wasn't so strong what but as she journeyed as the camels carried her just like the Holy Ghost is carrying us from this world to the next world maybe maybe the influence got stronger you know maybe she began as she was listening to early days and isn't what's what's Isaac like what's he really like and she no doubt would have would have put him under that great you know what a porter of a question after question and Eliezer would have been telling her this is what he's like a missus character this is what he looks like this is what he likes and doesn't like if this is us hot and all these things you know s and she was hearing and she was hearing and the ASA tell her about Isaac I mean she became more like trouble all the time hallelujah I was like eternity was bumping bumping into her I mean changing her changing her but then eventually and to me that's like a CO threes they come close they bump into us hallelujah men we begin to hear from them more and more right but then eventually you're not just gonna bump into us ain't never actually get a hold of us right we're gonna become one with them I mean your father hallelujah sighs our eternity is literally get a comments carry us away I mean because as we become more like the word hallelujah I'm ending as you become more like kid bottle side what I have in my mind is down with my bride Thalia now it's going home time for my bride hallelujah amen this is where we have friends we closed it too there than here I think we should rejoice but a God that called you as the God that will rapture you I mean the God that called you unwashed you insane you he'll deliver you from all your fear in trouble I mean the battle is the Lord's hallelujah memory bacon just got off the camel and the camel characterising I mean and this palace Holy Ghost is worth that we water without price now Thanksgiving it out join I'm in that same word hell are the same holy God's will pack us from this world to the next world amen till we have nothing to fear hallelujah but trust that's how you feel about it amen don't try and do it on your own work I tried work it out in your human understanding I mean I'm trying to preach the message in a legalistic way of trying to find favor with God you won't get anywhere you're XenApp disappointed I mean but if you really fall in love with him give me a life and he makes the wood glue hallelujah I mean you'll never be disappointed doolally hardships you let me sorrow would worry but but deep down in your soul you won't worry about those things only why because
