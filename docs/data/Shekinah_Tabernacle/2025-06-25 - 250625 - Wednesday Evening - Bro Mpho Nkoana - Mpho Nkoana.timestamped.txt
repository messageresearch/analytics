[0:00] [Music]
[1:08] You're right.
[1:14] [Music]
[2:55] Praise the Lord. Good evening.
[2:59] It's good to be here. You happy?
[3:02] You're refreshed. Had a good day.
[3:05] winning.
[3:09] [Music]
[3:12] I feel like the day is, you know, those
[3:15] days where the day is about there and
[3:17] you're kind of you're trying to catch up
[3:18] with it throughout the day and it's sort
[3:19] of just slightly ahead of you all day.
[3:22] You don't quite catch it. But I'm um
[3:26] yeah, I think I do too many things. I
[3:27] run too many too much stuff and you get
[3:29] all But I'm glad to be um here tonight.
[3:32] I'm glad to to um
[3:36] to do the main focus in our lives, which
[3:39] is the Lord.
[3:41] You know, it it all of the other stuff
[3:44] that we do
[3:47] outside of that is is
[3:50] like I know it's it's I know there's
[3:52] purpose in everything that we do, but
[3:53] when you boil it all down, it's not it's
[3:55] it is it is just a use of time, a waste
[3:58] of time because we got to use our time
[4:00] on something. So we just use it here,
[4:01] use it there, use it there, you know,
[4:02] but you know people take things. It's
[4:05] funny you you people take things so
[4:07] seriously. Say say today there could be
[4:11] a deadline that you have to meet
[4:12] tomorrow and it's all this panic about
[4:14] meeting this thing and it's it's very
[4:16] serious and there's jobs are on the line
[4:18] and whatever it might be and all this
[4:19] sort of stuff, you know. But it's funny
[4:22] how let's say a nuclear bomb was
[4:26] launched in some country and blew up
[4:28] another country. Suddenly that deadline
[4:30] would mean nothing,
[4:33] you know, it it suddenly would be like,
[4:34] "Oh no, that who cares about that now?"
[4:36] It's like, "Hang on, two hours ago that
[4:38] was the most important thing in the
[4:39] world and we were losing hair over it
[4:40] and it was this big stress." You know,
[4:42] we we sort of put all this stuff on
[4:44] ourselves and and it's, you know, I know
[4:45] we got to do that. We got to have things
[4:46] like that. But in all of our endeavors,
[4:49] we want to do the main thing, which is
[4:51] put the Lord number one. We want to be
[4:53] like Mary, not like Martha.
[4:55] you know, she was busy doing stuff, but
[4:58] Mary just sat at Jesus' feet and just
[5:00] learned from him. And the Lord said,
[5:01] "Actually, she's done the better thing."
[5:03] So, let's stand this evening and um
[5:06] worship the Lord. And and and I always
[5:08] love Wednesdays cuz it's always like a
[5:09] it's a good time. It's a good time to to
[5:12] remind the devil whose team we're on and
[5:13] just to come and worship the Lord
[5:15] tonight. So, let's um let's open in a
[5:16] word of prayer and just invite the Lord
[5:18] here. Lord, we thank you that we can be
[5:19] here tonight. Lord, we thank you that

[23:56] Every moment I
[24:01] Oh Lord, have your way in me.
[24:10] Brothers and sisters, I greet you
[24:11] tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus
[24:13] Christ. Amen. Amen. And
[24:16] it's true that what brother Isaac said,
[24:20] you know, everything else
[24:22] even in the book of
[24:25] at least
[24:28] he says everything is just vapor.
[24:32] Everything is just vapor. So the things
[24:34] that we can actually worry ourselves,
[24:38] they are not worthy. They are not worth
[24:40] worrying. and the things that we
[24:43] shouldn't we should be worrying about we
[24:46] leave.
[24:47] So may God help us and guide us tonight.
[24:50] Amen. We are going to read the Bible.
[24:52] Let me just open this computer cuz I
[24:55] never really use this. Brother Isaac and
[24:57] the musicians, the Lord bless you very
[24:59] much for the songs. Amen. and I'll open
[25:03] this thing and then we will read our
[25:06] Bible.
[25:11] God bless you richly.
[25:13] So
[25:15] um it was supposed to be me according to
[25:18] the schedule and then uh then then then
[25:24] I was off off the list because it was
[25:26] going to be my wife's birthday and then
[25:29] I'm back again. So, uh, it looks like I
[25:32] was I tried to get off, h of the Lord,
[25:35] but I couldn't. I tried I tried very
[25:38] hard, but it looks like the footsteps of
[25:41] the children of God are ordered of the
[25:43] Lord. Amen. So, let's just read a
[25:46] scripture while we standing and then uh
[25:50] um
[25:52] let's read the book of James chapter one
[25:56] and we can we can sit.
[25:59] James chapter 1.
[26:03] Once you are there, just say amen. Amen.
[26:05] Amen. How many are happy to be in the
[26:07] service of the Lord tonight? It's a
[26:09] great privilege to be here. Amen. James
[26:12] says, you know, James was a pastor. He
[26:15] was a pastor of a church. So listen to
[26:18] what he says from verse two. And he
[26:21] says, "My brethren,
[26:24] count it all joy when he fell into
[26:28] diverse temptations."
[26:30] I want you to underline the word joy.
[26:34] Count it all.
[26:37] Joy. When all sorts of temptations fall
[26:40] unto you, count it as joy.
[26:43] What a statement. Someone can say, "Ha,
[26:46] what kind of a statement?" But let's
[26:48] proceed. Verse three, knowing these that
[26:52] the trying of your faith workketh
[26:55] patience.
[26:57] Three,
[26:59] but let patience have her perfect work,
[27:03] that ye may be perfect and entire,
[27:06] wanting nothing. Verse five, if any of
[27:11] you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that
[27:15] giveth to all men liberally and araidth
[27:19] not, and it shall be given him. Let's
[27:23] just pray. If you have a need, maybe you
[27:26] can just show the Lord by raising off
[27:28] your hand and your heart before him.
[27:30] He's attentive and he's listening. Our
[27:33] heavenly father, Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:36] Lord, you know all my weaknesses that
[27:40] I'm I'm just but vapor before you. But
[27:44] Lord, in this vapor, you chose to come
[27:47] and dwell. We know in ourselves, Father,
[27:50] we are incapable.
[27:52] And that is why, Father, we first of all
[27:54] welcome you. As brother Isaac was
[27:57] saying, Lord, you are our priority
[27:59] tonight. And we are so thankful that you
[28:02] brought us here to come and fulfill the
[28:04] very purpose of why you created us. I
[28:07] pray that you bless your word tonight.
[28:10] And Lord, when where we have gone wrong
[28:12] in our thoughts, our behavior and
[28:14] actions, please forgive us, Father. We
[28:16] are we love you very much, Lord. And we
[28:19] don't want to let you down. And we pray
[28:21] that you just wash us clean with your
[28:23] blood.
[28:24] As we stand in your presence, bless the
[28:26] husband that are here listening, those
[28:29] that are streaming. Also, we think of
[28:31] our precious sister Christine, Lord, and
[28:34] her family. May you just touch her
[28:36] tonight, heavenly father. Lord, we know
[28:39] that the enemy, Lord, he he so wish to
[28:42] have us, but he can't. He wishes to harm
[28:45] us, but he only does it, Lord, according
[28:47] to the conditions provided. And we pray
[28:50] tonight, Lord, that you just heal our
[28:52] sister completely. Lord, let there be no
[28:54] more concussions. Let let the pain
[28:56] disappear. And we bind all the pains and
[28:59] all the the inconveniences in the name
[29:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ. We commit uh
[29:04] um the brothers and sisters here. I
[29:07] commit myself, Lord. Lord, help us
[29:10] tonight as we read your word for your
[29:12] honor and for your glory. We ask these
[29:14] things in the name of our loving Lord
[29:16] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Please enjoy
[29:19] the comfort of your seats while I remain
[29:22] standing. Um, so the the Bible here in
[29:28] the book of James
[29:31] talks about us counting it all joy when
[29:34] all sorts of things fall unto us. So
[29:36] tonight I just want us to speak about
[29:40] this topic. Um,
[29:42] let me just
[29:45] put a stopwatch.
[29:47] So I would like us to speak about you
[29:49] know how okay let me put it this way our
[29:54] view
[29:56] our view
[29:58] or our perception the way we look at
[30:03] temptations
[30:05] the way we look at uh you know you know
[30:09] the word trial trials trials
[30:13] you know hard times the way
[30:16] the The way we look at a reproach,
[30:18] reproach, the way we look at
[30:20] persecutions,
[30:22] you know, troubles, problems,
[30:24] situations
[30:27] of life, the way we look at them, h how
[30:31] we understand them and how we appreciate
[30:34] them
[30:36] because
[30:37] James tells the church, he says, "Count
[30:40] it all joy." So this uh if the brothers
[30:44] are listening,
[30:45] this is what what what we spoke about on
[30:47] Monday at the minister's meeting and I
[30:51] thought maybe we can just have a slight
[30:53] maybe add a few things here and there.
[30:54] If not um those that that listen to the
[30:57] tape, please forgive me. I'm happy
[31:00] brother Ben and brother David are not
[31:01] here, but maybe the other brothers have
[31:04] already listened. But if you hear that
[31:06] I'm repeating things, I'm sure the Lord
[31:08] would like to bless someone with
[31:10] something. But you see, we always we
[31:13] often say God is good, isn't it, brother
[31:16] Collin? God is good. And you'll even
[31:19] hear some of us sitting there saying all
[31:20] the time. If brother Isaac said God is
[31:23] good, we say all the we say it. I'm the
[31:26] first one.
[31:28] All the time. But hey, if go God is so
[31:31] good, h God is love. He's wonderful. Why
[31:38] he allowed these things that I'm talking
[31:40] about at temptations, trials and
[31:43] persecutions, pain, pain,
[31:48] trouble and situations that are just
[31:51] just above my my they're just above my
[31:53] level. A
[31:55] why must I face this situation? You see,
[31:58] so the key is not those things. The key
[32:04] is how I'm approaching or how I'm going
[32:08] to look my attitude towards those
[32:10] things.
[32:12] And you know why I'm saying this? This
[32:14] is the reason why I'm saying this.
[32:16] Because there's one thing that is very
[32:17] clear, sister Maggi, that you are a
[32:19] daughter of God.
[32:22] That is clear. Crisp.
[32:25] There's no crisp. Is that right way to
[32:27] pronounce it? It's crystal clear. That
[32:30] is crisp. It's so clear. is is there's
[32:33] no there's no ruler needed to straighten
[32:36] it. That is very clear that you are a
[32:38] son and you are a daughter of God. One
[32:41] out. And it's also very clear that the
[32:45] Bible taught us that all things works
[32:47] together for good to them that loves the
[32:52] all things all things good and bad. You
[32:56] see that this is this is what is
[32:58] happening. the
[33:00] God
[33:03] before he was God
[33:05] h he he wanted to share himself and his
[33:11] eternity with someone
[33:15] that's the good his goodness when you
[33:17] know when he starts to show not when it
[33:19] starts when it starts to show he wanted
[33:22] to to share himself and then you were
[33:25] there in his mind you were in his mind
[33:28] and he created you and he said, "Yeah,
[33:30] this is the one I want to spend eternity
[33:34] with."
[33:36] You see his goodness. And then h he then
[33:40] he started to to have a plan. Now he
[33:42] started to have a plan and he put a plan
[33:44] together and then a master plan in
[33:47] there. There's other plans. Plan of your
[33:49] life. How your life is going to unfold.
[33:52] How how you're going to come through
[33:53] your grandparents and and how your
[33:55] children and everything. He has a plan
[33:57] how you're going to to to get lost and
[33:59] how he's going to redeem you. He has a
[34:01] he had a plan of of of of of redemption
[34:05] and he puts all those things together
[34:07] just that what he saw in his mind can
[34:10] come to pass. Amen. One of them being to
[34:13] share it with you. So that kind of a God
[34:17] and isn't he good? Yes. And sorry I
[34:22] forgot this thing locks. So then then he
[34:26] then uh allowed us and allowed
[34:30] everything to happen as it was and allow
[34:33] allow the situation of Adam to go the
[34:37] way that it went. H he allowed it to a
[34:40] point where he uh let me just say
[34:44] forgive me. Okay. still still thinking
[34:47] to a point where h Satan thought ah
[34:52] this guy I can actually be above him
[34:56] because you see there was there were two
[34:58] two angels was powerful Lucifer and
[35:02] Michael by the way this is not in my
[35:04] nose even those two angels this one was
[35:07] more beautiful this one called Lucifer
[35:10] he was more gifted
[35:12] he was more beautiful more good-looking
[35:15] more He he he was a bling bling guy.
[35:20] Do you know what is bling bling?
[35:22] What do they call it? So if you came
[35:25] there from somewhere and look and I look
[35:27] wrongly, you could say ah that one is
[35:31] the right one. Lucifer is a guy and you
[35:33] could miss it. Michael was humble.
[35:36] Michael was the humble humble one. It
[35:38] even appeared as if Michael is more
[35:40] powerful.
[35:42] But Lucifer lacked revelation. and he
[35:43] didn't realize that the very Michael who
[35:45] came to the level of an angel is
[35:47] actually the one who created him.
[35:50] So h let me just put this um your
[35:59] sorry save my password
[36:05] so I will
[36:08] right so I won't allow it to log again
[36:11] so
[36:13] now that was not in my nose I don't know
[36:15] why I said it but the point I wanted to
[36:17] bring across was he was so humble and he
[36:22] wanted us to look like him. In other
[36:25] words, he wanted us to be gods
[36:29] to everything that is was in him, he
[36:32] wanted us to manifest it. So that is why
[36:35] him he wanted also to be like us.
[36:39] We'll we'll get to that point. But and
[36:41] and you'll understand as I go along why
[36:43] I'm talking about this persecutions and
[36:46] how we need to have a view because the
[36:48] Bible says, you see, God's view is
[36:52] different from our mind's view. It's so
[36:56] opposite like from the north. What's the
[36:59] opposite of north? South or the east and
[37:02] the west. They are like this. When God
[37:04] thinks this way, the cannal mind goes
[37:06] there.
[37:08] That is why the Bible says h the Bible
[37:11] says
[37:13] the straight is the gate and the narrow
[37:16] is the way. But then you who's walking
[37:20] on the narrow road, what do you think is
[37:22] there on the narrow road? The narrow
[37:24] road is not an easy road. The we is
[37:28] clear is explaining that it's narrow.
[37:32] It won't be easy to walk like you're on
[37:33] the highway. But the highway, that one
[37:36] is so broad that
[37:39] broad the broad gate. So the narrow one
[37:42] is the one that he chose. He he chose
[37:44] for you. Can I surprise you? He also
[37:47] chose it for himself that road because
[37:50] everything that is in him, he wanted it
[37:52] to reflect in us. And everything that is
[37:55] in us, he wanted it to reflect in him.
[37:58] Then he then he he became then he he
[38:00] decided to become a a human being.
[38:04] He decided to become a human being to to
[38:07] be hungry.
[38:09] Imagine God they change a nappy on God.
[38:14] How humble can that be? God
[38:19] he get hungry and he gets flu. He gets,
[38:24] you know, he he came to the level of a
[38:26] sinful level
[38:28] so that we can get to the level of God.
[38:31] So that's that's that's the whole idea.
[38:34] Everything that he he he made or he
[38:37] planned, he did not want me and you to
[38:41] go through ourselves without seeing him
[38:44] going through that.
[38:47] Did you get me? So he he he these things
[38:51] that happens to us, these persecutions
[38:54] or whatever a situation a what whatever
[38:58] a trouble they are done purposefully.
[39:05] They were they are done intentionally.
[39:09] You know he's doing them in a very
[39:10] deliberate way. They are very deliberate
[39:13] and they are very h and they are
[39:15] seasonal. By the way they are not
[39:18] permanent. The Bible says h
[39:21] these things are temporal. Anything that
[39:23] the Lord can allow you to go through is
[39:25] temporal. It's not permanent. But why
[39:29] I'm saying is seasonal because a season
[39:31] comes and go.
[39:33] It something again something can come in
[39:36] a different form because there's
[39:38] constantly a discussion before God and
[39:40] the devil. You know the devil went
[39:42] before God. The Bible says there was a
[39:44] meeting between God and the devil Jonah
[39:46] and they discussed and they discussed
[39:49] about a man called Job. You know his
[39:51] story. We we'll read about him now. So
[39:54] the way the way things happen, I'll talk
[39:56] about Job just now. But but the way that
[39:58] things happen, it is because God wants
[40:01] to achieve something. So can I can I can
[40:04] is it fair for me to say therefore
[40:07] brothers and sisters actually
[40:11] brother Isaac touched touched on this
[40:12] point. Can I say it's not really much
[40:16] about me and you first it's about God.
[40:21] It's about him. So everything is about
[40:25] God. So if we start like that in our
[40:27] hearts, in our mind, if we can say h
[40:31] it's about God, it's about him and us
[40:38] cuz first is about him. It was him who
[40:40] who was sitting there. He was not even
[40:42] God. He was there in his whole existence
[40:47] being everything and everywhere. There
[40:49] was no time. Then he decided to start
[40:51] thinking and he had thoughts. He had
[40:53] you. He created you. And you see the
[40:56] thought of God as I said before is is
[40:59] not like my thought and your thought.
[41:00] The thought of God is it is a reality.
[41:03] When God thinks something is tangible,
[41:05] is more than tangible. So you were there
[41:09] more better than the way you are here
[41:11] now in God's mind. So it's about him. If
[41:17] we think and start to think like that
[41:19] every time then young people we will get
[41:22] it right all the time because everything
[41:24] that happens to you you first think of
[41:27] him.
[41:29] Everything that is coming your way you
[41:30] think about him. Everything that you
[41:33] want to do you think about him
[41:36] but it's about him and you but not you
[41:41] and him. Amen. Are are are you with me?
[41:45] So, it's all about him first. And I'll
[41:47] show you why. Let me show you. And what
[41:52] example can I give you? Can I give you
[41:53] an example maybe of the word of
[41:56] forgiveness? Let's just talk a little
[41:58] bit about forgiveness, you know, the
[42:02] gift. Is it a gift or but forgiveness?
[42:04] You know, forgiveness.
[42:06] You you you must have God in order to
[42:10] properly forgive. Look at it this way.
[42:14] He was there and then he decided to die
[42:19] and then h so that my sins and your sins
[42:23] can be forgiven
[42:26] so that
[42:28] we can receive a salvation for free so
[42:32] that he can redeem us so that you know
[42:35] we can be justified you know the word
[42:37] justified it it's like sister s it's
[42:40] like just as if you never did did just
[42:43] like you never did nothing. if you ever
[42:46] did anything and and I I forgive you
[42:49] just like you have never done it
[42:52] and or you know there's just so many
[42:55] things I'm getting overwhelmed and then
[42:57] he had something called an atonement for
[43:00] us and atonement is like if you go and
[43:02] look at the word atonement you'll
[43:04] actually find it's from two ways at one
[43:08] at onement at one meaning an atonement
[43:13] was like sin came in between and death
[43:16] and they broke that connection between
[43:18] God and you. They broke sin broke it and
[43:21] there was this thing called sin in
[43:23] between that that caused a disjuncture
[43:26] between your connection and God and then
[43:28] now he brings a plan of atonement
[43:31] through the blood and then he he applies
[43:34] atonement and then the atonement seal it
[43:37] seal your connection like like if to a
[43:42] point where if you say ah but Isaac did
[43:44] this to me he says what are you talking
[43:46] about because you know you know If you
[43:49] break this hole here,
[43:53] shatter it. And we ask brother Ben to
[43:55] fix it. And he come and seal it. He fix
[43:57] it in such a way that you can't even see
[43:59] that there was a crack here. Isn't it?
[44:01] That's what atonement does. Atonement
[44:04] come and and then you won't know that
[44:07] there was ever a break called of sin
[44:10] there. So forgiveness works like that.
[44:13] He he forgiveness.
[44:16] I don't know how to explain it. But if
[44:19] we can't have his forgiveness,
[44:22] then God cannot be God.
[44:25] Because God in his mind had these things
[44:28] that must be fulfilled,
[44:31] healing, forgiveness,
[44:34] protection.
[44:36] He had all these things. Then he had to
[44:39] there had to be things to happen. He had
[44:41] to make the devil. He had to make all
[44:43] these things h so that everything can
[44:46] work to bring what was in God before.
[44:49] You never heard the prophet saying h
[44:51] before there was a a a fish
[44:55] before there was water there. What did
[44:57] he say?
[44:59] So before you sin, before you sinned,
[45:02] there was already forgiveness waiting
[45:04] for you.
[45:07] So as if you have never done it before.
[45:10] So now you you you find people sitting
[45:14] there condemning themselves even after
[45:17] God has forgiven them.
[45:20] You see now you are looking at it the
[45:22] wrong way. God does not understand what
[45:25] you are talking about until another
[45:28] brother said we keep on saying oh sorry
[45:30] my lord I'm sorry. God has already had
[45:32] you
[45:34] for you is to accept his plan of
[45:36] atonement and for his forgiveness and
[45:37] move on. Yeah. What? All what God wants.
[45:41] Actually,
[45:42] he said, I was listening to this
[45:44] brother. He said, no amount of sorry is
[45:47] going to bring forgiveness to you.
[45:50] Sorry. Sorry doesn't bring forgiveness.
[45:52] What brings forgiveness is your
[45:54] repentance here in your heart. When you
[45:56] truly repent and God applies that,
[45:58] that's what actually true forgiveness
[46:01] is.
[46:03] When I just are sorry and I don't mean
[46:04] it, that's I just said sorry. It means
[46:07] nothing because I never repented. I
[46:08] never said sorry here. So how can I'm
[46:11] I'm actually failing God because what
[46:14] God wants is something that happens from
[46:16] the heart for his attribute of
[46:18] forgiveness to come. Amen. What God
[46:21] wants is for me to believe him so much
[46:24] so that he can do what he promised me.
[46:26] If I don't believe, how can he? That's
[46:29] right. So I'm failing him if I I I I
[46:33] don't believe him. and he he's given us
[46:36] all these things. So problems and
[46:40] troubles and temptations when they come
[46:42] our way, it's not time for us to say why
[46:45] me.
[46:48] No. God does not want to hear what? No.
[46:50] No. God wants to to hear Aiden.
[46:53] Lord, thank you for this fire. Lord,
[46:56] tomorrow when this one is finished,
[46:57] bring another one.
[47:00] Am I right? I I want to be sensitive
[47:03] because I know our sister got injured
[47:06] yesterday and I'm I'm very considerate
[47:09] of that.
[47:11] But what I'm trying to say is that
[47:13] everything that happens in our life in
[47:16] our life. It is to bring it's got a
[47:20] purpose that God wants to fulfill.
[47:23] uh me the amount that I can use to
[47:26] stress or to worry or to you know I I
[47:29] should actually be taking it the way God
[47:32] takes it because I know I'm a son of
[47:35] God. I know that he says he cares for me
[47:38] and I know he's not is not a liar. The
[47:42] devil is a liar and a father of lies.
[47:44] Therefore, God is the opposite. So if
[47:47] God is that like that and he was alone,
[47:50] he was not forced to create you. God was
[47:53] not forced to create the earth. He just
[47:56] willingly created you
[48:00] along the way. We we get lost and he
[48:02] restores us with his plan of restoration
[48:05] and he restores us for us to fulfill
[48:07] what he saw. The actually the what
[48:10] counts most is not much the people out
[48:12] there brother Ben in the world. Those
[48:15] ones, yes, they they can be part of the
[48:17] whole drama or plan, but the actual crux
[48:23] of the matter who participate in the
[48:26] plan of God is you. If you can't be
[48:29] there, God's plan can't work.
[48:32] You don't don't don't don't no don't
[48:35] don't don't belittle yourself. I'm
[48:36] saying you. If you cannot be there, so
[48:40] for me to be there, I must fulfill God's
[48:43] plan. So that means every time I must
[48:45] always say, "God, show me the manual."
[48:48] What says the manual? That's right.
[48:50] Because if I do it not according to his
[48:52] manual, I'm failing him and I'm part of
[48:54] his main team. What what what would God
[48:58] do? So God, as another brother says,
[49:01] wants to work in partnership with me and
[49:04] you. He wants to work together with you.
[49:06] You know, he wanted to be men and he
[49:08] wanted men to be him. That is why all
[49:11] these things he allowed them. Those
[49:12] things they are the triggers. They
[49:15] trigger God.
[49:17] Like brother Ben Glor said here one time
[49:19] when you No. No. Isaac was made to meet
[49:22] me
[49:24] and I was made to meet him and to be
[49:28] happy and to upset him and him to upset
[49:30] me.
[49:33] Yes. Because look if if he doesn't upset
[49:38] me then who should upset me?
[49:42] And and and who who is God must forgive
[49:44] now because God must forgive. I must do
[49:48] wrong so that God forgives me. I must
[49:50] get sick so that God must heal me. Those
[49:54] things are painful when you say them.
[49:56] They even say it's easier to say brother
[49:59] because you are not in that situation.
[50:00] Yes, it's easy. But God will also put me
[50:04] in a situation. One day my husband, you
[50:07] know, and I thought my children were
[50:09] inside there and I ran one day. I said
[50:12] to the brothers, I'll give you a
[50:13] testimony about this one day. And then
[50:15] and then and then it burnt to ashes and
[50:18] I realized I don't even have any
[50:20] insurance, brother
[50:22] Colin. I realized I didn't have any
[50:24] insurance. The all my plans
[50:28] zero. So God don't want you at that time
[50:32] to worry. He wants you to look to him
[50:36] and to look to him meaningfully connect
[50:39] with him from your heart. You see a very
[50:42] weak Christian, a weak weak weakest
[50:44] person, if that person comes before God
[50:48] with a a sincere heart, God hears that
[50:51] person. The person that you say all of
[50:54] you saying ah this one
[50:57] if we I don't we don't do that. But a
[51:00] weakest believer who can be sincere and
[51:03] come with a sincere heart, God listens
[51:05] to that person and a God do something
[51:07] for that person because of the heart. So
[51:10] God is a God of hearts. In his heart he
[51:13] thought out of the heart a man
[51:15] thinkketh. Right? So we okay let's let's
[51:18] move on otherwise I'm not going to
[51:19] finish. I'll keep on deviating from my
[51:22] context. I'll read for you a few
[51:24] scriptures just to to show you that
[51:27] trials and temptations are not for you
[51:29] to say, "Oh,
[51:32] you know, they are not yours." You know,
[51:34] God put them there for a purpose, for a
[51:37] reason, and they are seasonal, but they
[51:39] are intentional. Your father approved
[51:41] them.
[51:43] Stamp stamp stamp. And I didn't
[51:47] negotiate with us because he knows
[51:49] better. He never negotiated with us for
[51:51] us to be born. He doesn't negotiate with
[51:53] us when we go home. No, he doesn't. So
[51:57] he whatever history we can think about
[51:59] ourselves, God does not know at this
[52:02] point in time what you are talking
[52:03] about.
[52:05] He does not
[52:12] apologies about that again. Let's let's
[52:13] read the book of Psalm.
[52:16] Psalm
[52:18] Psalm 34:E 90
[52:22] Many are the afflictions of the
[52:24] righteous. Many
[52:30] a righteous person is a person who's
[52:32] who's got God in their life. A righteous
[52:34] person is a son and a daughter of God
[52:37] because only the word of God is
[52:39] righteous, Sister Jo. There's nothing
[52:40] else. Only the word of God. So a a
[52:43] person who's got the word of God, he's
[52:45] the righteous person. But the Bible says
[52:47] many are the afflictions of that person.
[52:50] Many.
[52:52] But
[52:54] the Lord deliverth him out of them all.
[52:59] Is that the same all that said all
[53:01] things works together for good? That's
[53:04] the same all. A double L. All of them.
[53:08] So, and it even says somewhere that when
[53:11] the enemy brings,
[53:13] what does it say? That God raises up a
[53:16] standard.
[53:19] Where am I Bible readers?
[53:22] Like a flood. When the enemy comes like
[53:24] a flood, God raises up a standard. In
[53:27] other words, when the tide comes high
[53:30] and strong, I'm above the tide. Didn't
[53:32] he raise your standard for the ark?
[53:35] When the flood came,
[53:38] what happened to the unbelievers
[53:40] and what happened to the ark? And the
[53:43] righteous people were inside there
[53:45] because they believed the word of God
[53:47] and they moved inside. They were
[53:49] therefore righteous. So the ark, God
[53:52] raised the standard for it. It was the
[53:55] standard of God that lifted up the ark.
[53:58] when the flood came,
[54:01] he keepeth all his bones and not one is
[54:05] broken. I I rather take the word of God
[54:08] regardless of what happens to me. That
[54:10] is why Paul and Silas when they were in
[54:12] prison.
[54:15] You know the Bible says they were,
[54:18] you know, do you know stalks? Those
[54:20] little sticks, not little, but they with
[54:23] chains, those blocks of wood. They tie
[54:25] your feet like this and and you and and
[54:27] and here and and and your neck. You
[54:30] can't move. And they put you in the
[54:33] inner inner prison.
[54:36] So they psychologically destroying you
[54:38] that you you you know that even if you
[54:41] get out of these talks, there's three
[54:43] more prisons to go through. But what
[54:45] what did Paul and Silas do? How did they
[54:48] look at that situation?
[54:50] The Bible says they started to sing the
[54:52] hymns and the songs and they started to
[54:55] say hallelujah.
[54:58] Hallelu
[54:59] hallelu.
[55:02] Let's praise the Lord. The Bible says
[55:04] they started to sing like that. And the
[55:07] Bible says when they sang like that the
[55:10] atmosphere changed because they looked
[55:12] at their situation differently. They
[55:16] didn't look they knew that hey brother
[55:19] as a son and a daughter of God there is
[55:20] nothing that the devil can do to you
[55:23] Marion
[55:25] nothing. Not even death can do anything
[55:29] to you. And it's not about we are not
[55:31] breaking. We are just saying what the
[55:33] word of God says. When he saved you, he
[55:36] meant it. When he chose you, he meant
[55:40] it. And he knew that this is my son.
[55:43] Think about that boy that the brother
[55:45] showed us here, brother Ben, when he was
[55:47] in the pig star in with pigs there. What
[55:50] what went through his mind? Because
[55:52] before then, he lost his mind and he
[55:55] asked for everything, he left. Then one
[55:57] day when he was sitting with those pigs,
[55:59] the revelation struck him and then he
[56:02] started to realize actually who he was.
[56:06] I told about Job. So I won't repeat Job.
[56:09] I'll just quickly jump to
[56:12] Romans.
[56:19] Romans chapter 5,
[56:22] it says uh from verse two, by whom also
[56:28] we have access by faith into this grace
[56:31] wherein we stand and we and rejoice in
[56:34] hope of the glory of God. And now only
[56:38] so and not only so but we glory in
[56:43] tribulations.
[56:45] You see the very reason why why God also
[56:48] put us together was that we can be an
[56:51] encouragement to one another because if
[56:54] brother Ed has gone through some
[56:56] situation in his life before and then
[56:59] brother Ben went through a situation in
[57:01] his life before and then brother Isaac
[57:04] here brother Lena if if don't you think
[57:06] that is a benefit when they come and
[57:09] testify to someone about what they went
[57:12] through before
[57:13] amen when I have gone through a
[57:15] situation
[57:17] and then one day you fall in a similar
[57:19] situation and I share with you how the
[57:22] Lord delivered me. Don't you think that
[57:23] is an encouragement?
[57:25] So we I I come into that trial already
[57:29] with a triumph in my heart knowing that
[57:32] God has already delivered me because he
[57:35] has delivered one of his children in
[57:37] this situation. In fact, when I brother
[57:40] Ben situation was worse, my one is half
[57:43] and we are all his sons. So definitely
[57:48] because time for him is not an issue.
[57:51] You just wait in the Lord and see.
[57:56] He told the children of Israel.
[57:59] He told them. He said, "Hey, stop. Don't
[58:02] don't cry, Moses.
[58:05] Uh he said tell them to look there.
[58:09] Do you see those Egyptians?
[58:13] You will see them no more.
[58:17] Not
[58:19] not that they will be on the other side
[58:21] and then you'll be you won't they will
[58:23] be no more existing. You'll see them no
[58:26] more. So God does not want us to worry
[58:29] when when the river looks uncrossable.
[58:32] So we go into the tribulations
[58:36] glorifying God already. We go before God
[58:39] already saying, "I am healed. I am
[58:41] healed. I can see. I can see. I've got a
[58:44] job. I've got a job. I am healed. I am
[58:47] already."
[58:49] While he's still there and we say it and
[58:52] we until it becomes part of us.
[58:55] As a son, the daughter of God approach
[58:57] things the way God approaches them. We
[58:59] don't approach them the way the enemy
[59:01] approach it. and cry hopelessly.
[59:04] No. And that's why we hold one another
[59:08] like this and we go forward. You say,
[59:12] "Brother, this thing, let's just take a
[59:15] few examples I wanted to share with you.
[59:17] Let's take Joseph as an example. Can I
[59:20] just drink some water?
[59:24] Let's take Joseph.
[59:26] You all know the story of Joseph, right?
[59:29] Who would have thought when Joseph
[59:32] was was was taken by his brothers and
[59:35] they even throw him in it, I think they
[59:37] beat him first, they kick him and they
[59:40] spite him and they they did all sorts of
[59:43] things
[59:45] and then before they just keep give him
[59:46] a finishing touch and they throw him in
[59:48] the pit.
[59:50] Who would have thought who who could
[59:53] read that scripture for Joseph at the
[59:54] time? He said, "My brother, just know
[59:56] that it works together for good for you
[59:59] down there.
[1:00:03] All things works together, Joseph.
[1:00:07] Who would have who would have said that?
[1:00:09] Don't worry, my brother. Count it all
[1:00:11] joy." That's right. Now, but it was
[1:00:16] Joseph later on who told his brothers,
[1:00:19] remember, he told them that no, no, no,
[1:00:21] no, no, no. Don't even apologize.
[1:00:27] Don't even apologize. Because before you
[1:00:30] even did that, you know, it was meant to
[1:00:33] preserve life. We must come to a point,
[1:00:36] brothers and sisters, where you you
[1:00:37] don't have to wait for your brother. I I
[1:00:39] I don't wait for your brother to
[1:00:41] apologize or your sister. Right.
[1:00:42] Beautiful. No. Because you are a son of
[1:00:45] God. You are a son of God. We are sons
[1:00:48] and daughters of God. We don't operate
[1:00:50] the way the world operate. That's right.
[1:00:52] You produce so much.
[1:00:56] Can I say you induce so much love
[1:01:02] until he just you just swallow your
[1:01:04] brother and he just swallows you or your
[1:01:06] sister. Love. Real love. Not no love.
[1:01:12] Yes.
[1:01:13] And you
[1:01:16] we we are given that capacity to produce
[1:01:18] it. We have it. If you have you have
[1:01:21] that capacity, God has given it to you
[1:01:23] in the form of the Holy Spirit. Inside
[1:01:26] there, there's everything to produce
[1:01:28] real love
[1:01:30] to your brother and love even the
[1:01:33] unlovable. Let alone out here. Love
[1:01:37] those ones also there on the street.
[1:01:40] have a pity for them. Be in the position
[1:01:43] where I can take my shirt and cut it
[1:01:46] half and share with that man. Those ones
[1:01:49] love them. I always love what brother is
[1:01:52] said that you know the Lord said to him
[1:01:55] if you are going to go out there be
[1:01:57] ready that those ones out there with
[1:02:00] wounds and drunk are going to come here
[1:02:02] and your wife is going to dress them up.
[1:02:05] Are you ready for that?
[1:02:09] First Peter chapter 1 verse 6. Oh, I was
[1:02:13] telling you the story of Joseph. I left.
[1:02:16] You see Joseph, he told him later that
[1:02:19] no brothers, please stand up. Stand up.
[1:02:22] Stop kneeling before me. I am still the
[1:02:25] same Joseph, your brother, the same one.
[1:02:28] Everything that happened, it was for a
[1:02:30] for the good. It was for me to be ahead
[1:02:32] of you. But the devil said, "No, this
[1:02:36] you you are supposed to die. You guys,
[1:02:38] you especially you, Simeon. You were so
[1:02:41] spiteful, Simeon. In that movie that we
[1:02:43] watched with the kids, Simeon man was
[1:02:45] characterized as a bad guy. They wanted
[1:02:48] to take his brother out of the pit. He
[1:02:50] said never. He was drunk. Simeon. And he
[1:02:53] was a rough one. So it was to preserve
[1:02:57] life. It is true. If I had the
[1:03:00] revelation that time, I I wouldn't be
[1:03:02] spitefully saying. I would just say,
[1:03:04] "Joseph, don't do my brother."
[1:03:06] all works together for good. At that
[1:03:09] time, it didn't appear like that, but it
[1:03:12] was the reality.
[1:03:14] Maybe it's painful to the flesh, but God
[1:03:17] doesn't look it through the eyes of the
[1:03:18] flesh. God looks it through the eyes of
[1:03:20] the spirit. Your spirit, did you ever
[1:03:22] realize that if you go on a fast, this
[1:03:24] is just my experience anyway. If you go
[1:03:26] on a prayerful fast and you fast and you
[1:03:29] fast and you fast, on the third or the
[1:03:31] fourth day, you don't feel hungry
[1:03:32] anymore. If you are praying, hunger
[1:03:35] doesn't bother you anymore. And then in
[1:03:37] fact when you start eating, you feel
[1:03:39] guilty. You feel ah I'm you I feel like
[1:03:43] I'm I'm now contaminated.
[1:03:47] So I'm trying to say that there are
[1:03:49] certain things that the spirit
[1:03:50] interprets them different from how the
[1:03:52] flesh the flesh deceives us big time.
[1:03:55] That is why the prophet went and
[1:03:57] preached that message that says lean not
[1:03:59] unto your own understanding.
[1:04:03] That was the first example. Joseph,
[1:04:05] let's take an example of brother
[1:04:07] Brenham.
[1:04:08] Pastor Brenham
[1:04:13] me I'm going to have a big discussion
[1:04:14] with you just I'm going to just book him
[1:04:17] that brother I would like to be with you
[1:04:20] even if it's just 10 years
[1:04:22] then brother Arman can come after us
[1:04:26] just to tell me how did you I mean that
[1:04:29] man and it goes against all odds against
[1:04:32] all what we know better
[1:04:35] education none his family none
[1:04:39] He he he he couldn't even say pull pit
[1:04:42] pullpit just like me. I can't pull pit
[1:04:45] until they corrected him. Then he takes
[1:04:49] then the very same man he takes a and
[1:04:52] then he takes a thought I'll have a
[1:04:54] piece of paper. He takes he takes that
[1:04:56] 1.5 million check
[1:05:00] dollars.
[1:05:02] I'm sure he was crying. I'm sure his
[1:05:04] body was saying what are you doing?
[1:05:07] Ah
[1:05:09] because he looked at things through the
[1:05:10] eyes of the
[1:05:12] what will you do more
[1:05:17] you tell your father that man is gone
[1:05:20] it's gone
[1:05:22] so I must look at things through the
[1:05:25] eyes of the spirit to come out right and
[1:05:27] the spirit is not here it's not in my
[1:05:30] five senses here the holy spirit
[1:05:33] so that was Joseph brother Brham
[1:05:37] same
[1:05:39] from a family of drunk people. Who how
[1:05:43] can a prophet come from such a family?
[1:05:45] Huh? A mother and a father. The day he
[1:05:48] was born, his father was there drinking
[1:05:50] moonshine the outside and the say
[1:05:53] Charles Brennham is a boy. Then he comes
[1:05:56] in that film that brother Isaac is going
[1:05:58] to make. You'll hear him. Charles
[1:06:00] Brenham is a boy. His grandmother did
[1:06:03] not even have shoes there. He never had
[1:06:05] a pair of shoes.
[1:06:07] How how can God get a prophet to leave
[1:06:10] the age the time the closing of this age
[1:06:15] to come and reveal God's plan?
[1:06:18] Yes, that's how Michael operates,
[1:06:22] not Lucifer. Lucifer operate blame,
[1:06:25] shine, shine. So be careful of shiny
[1:06:27] stuff.
[1:06:31] Let's read a
[1:06:33] you know you know the story. What I'm
[1:06:35] trying to demonstrate for you is that
[1:06:37] look at our clouds of witnesses
[1:06:40] and look at their lives. All their lives
[1:06:43] are characterized by hardship. I'm not
[1:06:46] saying you should suffer. I'm not saying
[1:06:49] you should go troubles. It hurts me too.
[1:06:54] But I'm just saying how we look at it
[1:06:57] should be different. How we approach it
[1:07:00] should be different. We shouldn't hit
[1:07:02] ourselves and sit there and No, no, no,
[1:07:04] no. We should be courageous
[1:07:06] and know that we have we have a father
[1:07:10] and that father has highly considered
[1:07:13] this trial. Therefore, let me not worry.
[1:07:19] Let's read first Peter. First Peter 1
[1:07:22] from verse 6. Wherein ye greatly rejoice
[1:07:26] through now for a season. If need be,
[1:07:30] you are in heaviness through manifold
[1:07:33] temptations. Many
[1:07:37] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:07:40] more precious than gold.
[1:07:42] Did anyone hear that? That our trials
[1:07:46] are more precious than gold.
[1:07:49] They they seek to sharpen no gold today
[1:07:52] in today's standard. They even want to
[1:07:54] make it a currency gold. Our trials are
[1:07:58] more precious than
[1:08:01] meaning we need them.
[1:08:06] We need them. Otherwise, if we don't
[1:08:08] have them, God is is God going to be a
[1:08:11] way maker. We sang a song,
[1:08:15] promisekeeper. Is he going to fulfill?
[1:08:17] Is he going to be a healer?
[1:08:19] If we don't have those ones, will he be
[1:08:22] a who will who will make a way if you
[1:08:24] don't get lost?
[1:08:27] God was supposed to restore you. I was
[1:08:29] supposed to be a naughty boy and be
[1:08:32] snacked and then I feel it
[1:08:37] and then I I see it differently.
[1:08:41] So it's not wrong to be
[1:08:43] Josh.
[1:08:45] They say they say that shepherd when
[1:08:48] that sheep went astray. Okay, maybe
[1:08:49] you'll say that sheep went astray. But
[1:08:52] that shepherd, a good shepherd, he went
[1:08:54] to it and he even broke his leg. a a
[1:08:56] good shepherd break his leg. Why didn't
[1:08:59] he just say no no sheep don't go there
[1:09:01] and bring it with his staff and then put
[1:09:03] it into the flock and say walk this way
[1:09:06] why why must he bring his leg if he
[1:09:08] loves it he's a loving God that he did
[1:09:12] out of love that is why long time when I
[1:09:15] was giving my children a good one I was
[1:09:19] doing it with a smile and they thought I
[1:09:22] was spiteful and I said no no no when I
[1:09:24] hit you pains me too so I'm hitting you
[1:09:27] with love of correction. How many should
[1:09:30] I How many then will just say one and
[1:09:34] then then more he get upset he'll just
[1:09:37] say three four
[1:09:40] that guy
[1:09:42] because he'll be upset with me he can
[1:09:44] just say 10 okay I must give you 10 come
[1:09:47] then so God when all those things be
[1:09:52] fall on us
[1:09:54] is for our good is better than gold
[1:09:57] let's read Corinthians we are closing or
[1:09:59] I jumps. I can just jump Corinthians and
[1:10:01] just quickly read for you Matthew or
[1:10:05] remind you about Matthew. Matthew
[1:10:06] chapter 24 it says and then
[1:10:09] 24 verse 10 to 40 it talks about
[1:10:12] endurance you know to to endure to
[1:10:15] endure
[1:10:18] is it
[1:10:20] does it make you think of the word
[1:10:21] resilient you know in today's language
[1:10:23] to endure. It says, "And then shall many
[1:10:26] be offended and and shall betray one
[1:10:28] another." That's from verse 10. Matthew
[1:10:32] 24
[1:10:38] I'm closing. I think today we'll just
[1:10:41] make it a if it's okay, we'll just make
[1:10:43] it a prayer meeting. I know it was
[1:10:44] supposed to be a preaching service, but
[1:10:45] let's just make it it a prayer meeting
[1:10:48] and then we can have time to pray, you
[1:10:50] know, for our sister. That's why I'll
[1:10:51] stop just now, then we can pray. But and
[1:10:55] and then verse verse 11 and it says and
[1:10:58] many many false prophets shall rise and
[1:11:00] shall deceive many and because because
[1:11:03] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:11:06] shall works cold
[1:11:08] and then but he that shall endure that's
[1:11:12] what I wanted to read for you. He or she
[1:11:15] that shall endure unto the end the same
[1:11:19] shall be saved.
[1:11:22] It's not our endurance. It is the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost endurance. By myself, I can
[1:11:27] endure. You can endure it.
[1:11:31] And I cannot even endure your problem or
[1:11:34] your challenge or your situation. Only
[1:11:36] designed for you by the designer. And
[1:11:40] even the solution is designed for God to
[1:11:43] come through you.
[1:11:48] and then until the end
[1:11:51] then you are saved.
[1:11:54] But don't don't misunderstand this verse
[1:11:56] to be saying you can only get saved if
[1:11:59] you endure. No, because you are you are
[1:12:02] saved. You are going to be able to
[1:12:03] endure. That's how I see that's how I I
[1:12:05] want to to put it. Romans says, oh this
[1:12:10] one, I love it. This is my favorite
[1:12:12] verse. My favorite verse in the Bible.
[1:12:15] Romans 8. You can go home and read it.
[1:12:17] For the law 8 from verse two, Romans,
[1:12:20] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:12:23] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:12:25] law of sin and death. The law that law
[1:12:28] is not the law thou shalt not. The law
[1:12:31] of the spirit looks at trials
[1:12:34] differently. For what the law would not
[1:12:36] do, that law in that it was weak through
[1:12:40] the flesh. God sending his own son in
[1:12:43] the likeness of a sinful flesh. Remember
[1:12:45] I told you and for sin condemns sin in
[1:12:49] the flesh
[1:12:51] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:12:53] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[1:12:56] the flesh but after the spirit. For they
[1:12:59] that are after the flesh do mind the
[1:13:01] things of the flesh. But us I like how
[1:13:05] brother Ben says put yourself there as
[1:13:08] but they that are after the spirit
[1:13:11] things of the spirit. So we look at
[1:13:13] these things through the eyes of the
[1:13:15] spirit when they come. Everything that
[1:13:17] happens, everything that you do,
[1:13:20] everything that you go through,
[1:13:21] everything, look it in the eyes of the
[1:13:23] spirit. Look it in the eyes of the Lord.
[1:13:26] Then you'll have a better view.
[1:13:30] Am I
[1:13:32] brother says temptations come, there
[1:13:36] will never be a temptation unless he
[1:13:38] give you grace to bear it.
[1:13:40] Yes. He says that and he's promised to
[1:13:43] meet you on every battle front right
[1:13:47] there. Stand in your place. He says that
[1:13:51] in that message, redemption by judgment.
[1:13:54] He says it and then I believe the
[1:13:56] apostle said that our trials are better
[1:13:59] than gold. We already spoke about this.
[1:14:01] He's confirming that brother Brandham
[1:14:03] that might be God might have God might
[1:14:07] have let you get sick in order that you
[1:14:10] might you might you might be a
[1:14:12] testimony.
[1:14:14] How will I know that God heals cancer if
[1:14:17] God does not heal brother Colin? He
[1:14:20] that's going to be a testimony for me
[1:14:22] that peradelter one day I if I come
[1:14:24] across that thing I can say wow even my
[1:14:27] brother God has healed him and that is
[1:14:30] why it's important for us to bear him
[1:14:32] for us to bear him in prayer
[1:14:34] meaningfully claiming that God no no no
[1:14:37] no we can't allow that Lord you you said
[1:14:40] in your word you will heal him and he's
[1:14:42] already healed that's the attitude we
[1:14:45] need to go before the Lord with Right.
[1:14:49] Each and in the message uh for him will
[1:14:52] I accept. I'll just read just touchups.
[1:14:56] He says every son that cometh to God
[1:14:59] must first be just chastened
[1:15:04] patched. Is that right? If you cannot
[1:15:07] stand chastisement of the Lord then you
[1:15:11] become a bastard unfortunately or an
[1:15:15] illegitimate child. You you claim God to
[1:15:18] be your father and you know nothing of
[1:15:21] him.
[1:15:24] A real true bornagain child of God
[1:15:26] stands firm.
[1:15:29] We are we are sw with the incorruptible
[1:15:32] seed of God. It cannot perish. See what
[1:15:36] I mean? When trials and troubles and
[1:15:38] temptations and heartaches and
[1:15:40] disappointments set in, something holds
[1:15:44] you.
[1:15:45] Not you holding
[1:15:47] something holding you. See, it isn't a
[1:15:50] question whether I hold or not. It's a
[1:15:53] question of whether he held or not him.
[1:15:58] That's the partnership that we have with
[1:16:00] he holds us.
[1:16:04] I would like us to stand and call the
[1:16:07] musicians
[1:16:09] and then we are going to pray
[1:16:12] tonight. We're going to pray for our
[1:16:14] precious sister Christine. We're going
[1:16:16] to pray for brother Colin. We going to
[1:16:19] pray. We are needy people, brothers and
[1:16:20] sisters. And God allowed this news to
[1:16:23] come among us. Sometimes you think that
[1:16:25] is your brother actually who's tested,
[1:16:27] who's tried, but it's not your brother
[1:16:29] maybe who's going through that. God
[1:16:32] wants to test you to see whether you'll
[1:16:33] pray genuinely
[1:16:36] and and you fail the test by not
[1:16:38] praying. Sometimes you think ah it is is
[1:16:41] brother Ed going through that. Oh I will
[1:16:43] remember you brother and then you go
[1:16:45] home and you don't even pray. God wants
[1:16:47] to see if I give Ed a problem. Will you
[1:16:50] pray?
[1:16:52] Be careful. We do we don't come into a
[1:16:55] body in Africans we say
[1:16:59] for mahala for nothing. We come for a
[1:17:02] purpose. Remember that same one where we
[1:17:04] spoke about a building. Some another one
[1:17:07] is a window, another one is a door,
[1:17:08] another one is this, another is a body.
[1:17:11] A body means it works together
[1:17:14] locally, your body, global body. That's
[1:17:18] how it works. So don't say I can't pray
[1:17:21] for people there in Somalia that I don't
[1:17:23] even know. It's part of you. It's the
[1:17:26] bride. You pray for them that are in
[1:17:28] Ukraine, that are right now in Israel,
[1:17:30] that are in everywhere. You pray for
[1:17:32] them. Even in Iran, if there's brother
[1:17:34] and sister there in Iran, sitting
[1:17:36] somewhere in the corner being bombed,
[1:17:38] remember that part of the bride because
[1:17:40] it is part of you. You'll go nowhere
[1:17:42] without them, without that part of the
[1:17:45] bride.
[1:17:47] So, we are going to sing a song, brother
[1:17:49] Isaac, and then I I I just feel that we
[1:17:52] can have a prayer meeting, you know, if
[1:17:54] it's okay, brothers, and then we can
[1:17:56] pray and remember also brother Ben. And
[1:17:58] then I don't know if there's more
[1:18:00] requests that were mentioned here but uh
[1:18:03] we can check them and then we can pray
[1:18:05] for them. We just become you know and of
[1:18:08] course today sorry to to be selfish it's
[1:18:11] also my darling wife's birthday. So we
[1:18:14] thank the Lord for sparing her and for
[1:18:16] keeping her. She's young today. And then
[1:18:20] we just want to remember sister
[1:18:21] Christine and we remember brother Ben
[1:18:24] and the children and then brother Colin
[1:18:29] and the Lord has healed you already
[1:18:30] soldier and then every desire that is
[1:18:33] among us. We're going to to pray for
[1:18:36] them. Do you want to to bring your your
[1:18:38] request sister?
[1:18:42] Brother Ben also is supposed to be
[1:18:44] preaching in Brisbane
[1:18:46] and then flying out tomorrow.
[1:18:51] already
[1:18:54] know.
[1:18:58] No matter what I see,
[1:19:01] no matter what I feel,
[1:19:05] no matter what I hear,
[1:19:09] I believe.
[1:19:12] No matter what I'm told,
[1:19:16] no matter how it seems,
[1:19:20] no matter what it cost,
[1:19:24] I believe.
[1:19:28] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:19:32] broken,
[1:19:35] I'll lay a hallelu
[1:19:39] on the altar.
[1:19:43] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:19:47] over,

[1:20:54] I believe.
[1:20:58] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:21:02] broken,
[1:21:04] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:21:08] on the altar.
[1:21:12] And if I look and it seems like it's
