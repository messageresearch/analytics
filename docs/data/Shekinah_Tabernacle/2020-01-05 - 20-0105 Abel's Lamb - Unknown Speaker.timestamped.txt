[6:47] changed and we're the most blessed
[6:50] people on the face of the earth you know
[6:52] to have we had food and raiment which
[6:55] would be continued but we have so much
[6:57] more than that we gave you an
[6:58] opportunity to to meet the King of Kings
[7:01] this morning to have the Spirit of God
[7:02] change our lives to make us make things
[7:05] better in whichever way that he would
[7:07] desire so let's um let's just give our
[7:09] full attention to God and put off the

[7:35] thanks for all that you've done for us
[7:37] Lord for paying them the price of our

[8:19] morning and meet you moving our midst
[8:21] the Lord that that that this would be a
[8:24] supernatural meeting this morning that
[8:26] it wouldn't be natural wouldn't just be
[8:28] a Lord sewing a ritual that we go
[8:31] through law but it would be a
[8:32] supernatural law to end and where Lord
[8:36] we're just under expectation it's not a
[8:38] hope so law but it's a no so because you
[8:40] said that we're two or three gathered

[43:12] of the 17th to the 19th of of January
[43:15] which is a couple of weekend it's time
[43:16] brother El Rey is gonna he's confirmed
[43:18] he's gonna bring his youth down and
[43:20] brother Canaan as is going to well he
[43:23] hasn't confirmed numbers yet with me but
[43:25] bring down the youth from Whanganui and
[43:27] and fielding so if we could just have a
[43:29] meeting directly after service to speak
[43:31] about what we're going to do a rough
[43:33] timetable but you if we could just
[43:35] that'd be really good also
[43:37] Easter weekend brother areas are having
[43:39] a convention and and Taranaki and
[43:41] Stratford you're going to host it at the
[43:42] war memorial hall and brother Jason
[43:44] Watkins from South Carolina will be the
[43:47] guest speaker now can I can I have that
[43:50] slideshow so there's just a report from
[43:55] from brother Ronnie and Papua New Guinea
[43:58] regarding the convention in December
[44:00] that is quite small anyway so I just
[44:04] want to read this out and and and I want
[44:06] you to keep this in mind he says you
[44:08] housewives you don't have to be a
[44:09] preacher
[44:09] there's brother Barron speaking you do
[44:11] something for the glory of God remember
[44:13] eternal things is what lasts forever
[44:15] and that's getting soul saved let that
[44:17] be the first thing of all your work all
[44:19] your ideas all your motives yesterday
[44:21] standing he's holding a mother's hand my
[44:24] arm around her her chin quivering and a
[44:27] a new boy laying there dying she said
[44:29] Billy I've longed and longed for you to
[44:31] come back to the tabernacle I said
[44:33] sister Ferguson I'd like to do that I
[44:35] said well look sister I could get maybe
[44:38] 50 soul safety at the Tabernacle that
[44:40] would be a good crop for a year I could
[44:42] get a hundred thousand of them saved in
[44:44] some other land see when I walk into
[44:47] glory he says I don't want to god save
[44:49] me he done saved me that settled but the
[44:52] thing of it is when I get there I want
[44:54] to look around and see the stars shining
[44:56] I mean I want to see something that that
[45:00] makes something if you've if you would
[45:02] have died and I was a great man to
[45:04] present like Lincoln or something like
[45:05] that they'd build a big memorial but one
[45:07] day it wouldn't be but one soul saved
[45:10] and glory says your name will be wrapped
[45:12] in that as long as is an eternity
[45:15] rolling on so he saying to that sister
[45:17] because he could go out and minister all
[45:19] the souls that he saved their names are
[45:22] wrapped up amen and that in the church
[45:24] that that sent him forth right so so we
[45:27] will be identified with every soul
[45:29] that's been saved I mean by our giving
[45:32] by our prayer by by by support amen so
[45:36] now so brother Rodney just just a
[45:38] background to this before I share his
[45:40] his report some of you don't know but so
[45:43] in June last year I went up to Papua New
[45:45] Guinea to speak of the natural at their
[45:48] National Convention which was hosted by
[45:49] brother Robert naka and Goroka and
[45:51] brother Rodney was the translator that
[45:53] that translated for me in those services
[45:55] and at the time he wasn't even a message
[45:58] believer he was a he was a formerly a
[46:00] Pentecostal not a pastor but an area
[46:03] overseer of a denomination there but it
[46:06] wasn't so but the Lord was really
[46:10] working on him in those services you
[46:12] know after one of the first services I
[46:13] spoke you know after I had closed the
[46:16] service in prayer and it was just me and
[46:17] him standing on the platform he said to
[46:19] me he said brother pen did you put your
[46:20] hands on my shoulders when you prayed I
[46:22] said no I didn't touch you when I prayed
[46:24] he said I felt two hands come upon my
[46:26] shoulders like you're staying behind me
[46:28] as you're praying I said no that wasn't
[46:30] me God was dealing with them and
[46:33] and then there was a service where I
[46:34] speaking about this that you know the
[46:36] fact that this message returns us to the
[46:38] original Pentecost and then in that
[46:40] service
[46:41] he stopped translating for three or four
[46:42] minutes because everyone could
[46:44] understand perfectly in pidgin English
[46:45] like I was fluent and I'm not fluent at
[46:47] all that's why he has to translate and
[46:49] all the ministers everyone saw what was
[46:51] going on they were so moved
[46:53] I've been one of the ministers that
[46:54] tried to close the service and prayer
[46:56] very stoic man he was just weeping over
[46:58] the pulpit he was so gripped by what was
[47:00] going on and then also brother Rodney he
[47:04] would can you can you turn this down a
[47:05] bit please he was also really amazed to
[47:09] see himself as Esther in the scripture
[47:10] you know he would say after every
[47:12] service yeah this is so powerful you
[47:15] know he says he's never been in services
[47:17] like that with a word or so so alive
[47:19] even though he was a you know a regional
[47:22] leader and a Pentecostal denomination
[47:23] for many years now this he was so moved
[47:27] by this convention that he became a
[47:28] believer and then he went and he started
[47:31] witnessing to others now one of which
[47:32] was a Pentecostal pastor that he invited
[47:35] to come to the message church in broker
[47:38] to hear brother Robert knock a minister
[47:40] on the Sunday now the night before so so
[47:44] the Saturday night brother Robert had a
[47:46] dream and and in this dream a
[47:48] Pentecostal man and woman came into his
[47:50] church and the Lord said you will work
[47:52] with this man and the next morning that
[47:55] man saw so the Pentecostal pastor the
[47:57] brother Ronnie witnessed who and his
[47:58] wife came into church and and they they
[48:01] really enjoyed the service and that
[48:02] Pentecostal pastor invited brother
[48:05] Robert to go speak at his church and
[48:06] when he went to speak of that church
[48:08] there was about seven or six
[48:09] denominational churches came together to
[48:11] hear that message and some of them they
[48:13] said they're praying for 12 years to God
[48:15] to visit their Manor and T is rejoicing
[48:17] saying this is what we've been waiting
[48:18] for so this is what catalyzed now the
[48:21] convention they've just had now I want
[48:23] you to keep in mind this quote when I
[48:25] read this because remember every soul
[48:30] that's saved because of what what what
[48:33] your your support your prayer your
[48:34] giving your name will be identified with
[48:36] it an eternity now and I also want you
[48:39] to keep in mind that my rough estimates
[48:42] on the high side before this convention
[48:45] there was only two hundred believers in
[48:46] the
[48:47] tree so now this is brother Ronnie's
[48:49] words he takes us to me says praise the
[48:52] Lord brother Benjamin this is the this
[48:54] is the report accurately taken from the
[48:55] crusade he says 5p aww churches with
[49:00] five pastors converted to the message of
[49:02] the hour each Church has more than 100
[49:05] Souls 3 UPC pastors one with a hundred
[49:09] and sixty-eight church members and two
[49:11] or 30 members each have converted to
[49:15] pastors from oneness churches also
[49:16] converted to the message of the hour
[49:18] with their entire families one st a
[49:21] pastor and five if sta members
[49:23] rebaptised in jesus name - 58 year old
[49:26] woman who are members of the EBC church
[49:29] also converted to the message and one
[49:31] Foursquare pastor with six of us church
[49:33] members converted that was one
[49:36] convention we've been praying for this
[49:39] for years that God would just sweep
[49:40] across their country because there's
[49:42] some up and some valleys up in that
[49:44] country that are God's elect they must
[49:46] hear this word they must become one with
[49:47] the Lord Jesus Christ then we can go
[49:49] home so that list you say well that's a
[49:52] lot of people they'll be brighter than
[49:53] that
[49:53] and that number but your names you will
[49:56] be associated with those souls because
[49:59] you gave because you prayed because you
[50:00] lifted that up before the Lord your
[50:02] names will be identified with this for
[50:04] eternity

[54:35] are and who you are oh Lord father may
[54:37] you grant it bless the reading of your
[54:38] word now bless a service Lord in Jesus
[54:40] Christ's name Amen amen god bless your
[54:44] friends you may have your seats this
[54:45] morning I'd like to speak about Abel's
[54:47] lamb but I read here in Joshua chapter 1
[54:50] because you know brother Branham would
[54:53] he would he would speak during his
[54:56] entire ministry he touched on it but but
[54:58] he came to the end of his life any any
[55:01] City you know he had a desire that he
[55:02] wanted to speak on the trail of the
[55:04] serpent now we know that he never
[55:06] condensed this into one service but but
[55:09] if you look into the entire message you
[55:11] can see the trail of the servant has
[55:12] already been preached but I mentioned
[55:14] last Sunday
[55:15] like to go through the scripture and see
[55:18] how the devil works in every age because
[55:20] he will come he will come against you in
[55:23] the same way and we know the Bible says
[55:25] that we are not ignorant to the devil's
[55:27] devices you may think well why do I need
[55:30] to know what the devil does in every age
[55:32] well you know I want to ask you the
[55:34] question do you know how to survive in
[55:36] your environment that you're living in
[55:38] you know your workplace your school your
[55:40] community your country this present age
[55:42] you know but and not just to survive but
[55:44] to overcome now so here we go now this
[55:49] now this is from Africa this is not my
[55:51] photo but this is a termite now when
[55:53] when we were at we're with brother Bryan
[55:56] Jones who am a hollow hollow there was a
[55:57] termite mound by the lion I'm enclosures
[56:00] he said brother put your finger in this
[56:01] hole so so so he put my finger in this
[56:04] hole and these termites started biting
[56:07] me now when they bite see they've got
[56:08] these big pincers here they bite and
[56:11] they just hold on now what he told me is
[56:14] you take the adult ones just say if
[56:16] you've cut yourself badly in the bush
[56:17] you take those termites and you get it
[56:20] to bite over where the wound is and and
[56:22] and the pincers just hold your wound
[56:23] closed then you rip the body off it'll
[56:25] stay there so they are they are nature's
[56:27] stitches now the thing is if I was in
[56:30] the bush in Africa I might need to know
[56:33] that because that's the environment I
[56:34] would be in right but if I don't know
[56:36] that I could be in trouble if I badly
[56:37] word myself how am I going to stitch
[56:39] myself up amen oh you say well or you
[56:44] could come across some predators or
[56:45] something now now in the bush and use
[56:47] yawn there's no there's no natural
[56:49] predators but you need to know just say
[56:50] if you're in the bush you would need to
[56:52] know what everything does you know most
[56:54] of us like myself you know we were at at
[56:56] at CEO and we're at Zealandia yesterday
[56:59] and there you you're walking along
[57:00] there's all different plaques and saying
[57:02] this tree does this and this Bush does
[57:04] this and I didn't know those things it
[57:06] just looks like a bush and that's a tree
[57:07] and and you're evidently we have the
[57:09] biggest protea in the world so I thought
[57:13] Africa I mean South Africa was at your
[57:14] national flower we've got the biggest
[57:16] one here anyway national sprint right so
[57:20] but you know but but they just like but
[57:23] but everything has a property now if
[57:25] you're living in the bush you would need
[57:27] to know how your environment works
[57:29] in order to survive and not just to
[57:32] survive but actually overcome you know
[57:34] sadly for myself you know I could maybe
[57:37] build a very rudimentary you know
[57:39] no shelter I know that there's like this
[57:41] green like hood or my stuff that grows
[57:43] and treats it that that's a very good
[57:44] firestarter that's as far as I know I
[57:47] would die I'd go hungry this food
[57:50] everywhere you can find it if you know
[57:51] what you're looking for you know but but
[57:53] you've got to know you got to know how
[57:55] your environment operates if you don't
[57:56] you'll die and it's the same so you know
[58:00] even but then and then if you take it
[58:02] another step higher and and you
[58:04] introduce predators into the into the
[58:06] environment now you really got trouble
[58:08] now this is now we got better photos
[58:10] than this but I just grabbed a couple
[58:11] like you take a hyena or a cheetah or
[58:15] you you you run to a herd of elephant
[58:18] how you're gonna survive that some
[58:21] people say well you just run no that's
[58:23] when you get killed but that's human
[58:26] instinct you run you don't run see but
[58:29] the thing is if you don't know how to if
[58:31] you don't know the behavior of these
[58:33] animals when you come across them you're
[58:35] in big trouble but if you do know the
[58:38] behavior of it then you can actually
[58:39] sidestep you can you can avoid them you
[58:41] can get around them or if you're hungry
[58:43] you can hunt them and and and eat them
[58:45] you say well I don't live in the Kruger
[58:48] National Park
[58:49] no but there's worse predators in New
[58:51] Zealand than a hyena it's called the
[58:53] devil and there's a lot of them and they
[58:56] hunt in packs and they're very good at
[58:58] what they do so you've got to know your
[59:02] environment you've got to know what's in
[59:05] your environment because we can't just
[59:07] walks like me wandering into the bush
[59:09] somewhere you know you can say I'm a
[59:11] tough guy I can handle the bush now
[59:13] you'll die doesn't matter how tough feel
[59:15] you think you know how great Bushmen you
[59:16] think you are if you don't know how to
[59:18] live in your environment you will die
[59:20] and it's the same thing in the spiritual
[59:22] if you don't know this environment this
[59:24] evil world you live in
[59:25] you will be charred by the devil you'll
[59:27] be chewed up spat out by him but if you
[59:30] know his trucks you know how he'll come
[59:32] against you you can withstand in this
[59:33] evil day and you can overcome Amy as it
[59:37] season you know season first Peter 5:8
[59:41] be sober be vigilant because your
[59:43] adversary
[59:43] three the devil as a roaring lion
[59:45] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[59:48] so we need to be very aware of his
[59:51] devices now last week we know when when
[59:54] I was at work I was talking to Christine
[59:56] on the phone and she was driving with
[59:58] the girls and and and the girls are
[1:00:00] singing the song and heavenly armor will
[1:00:02] into the land the battle belongs to the
[1:00:03] Lord no weapon that's fashioned against
[1:00:06] us will stand the battle belongs to the
[1:00:08] Lord and something struck me when I
[1:00:10] heard them singing I mean we have
[1:00:12] heavenly armor with heavenly armor I
[1:00:14] mean we have heavenly armor we have the
[1:00:16] whole armour of God I mean the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost anointed word living at us we have
[1:00:20] the heavenly armor I mean we've been
[1:00:21] equipped by God in this day now if we've
[1:00:24] been equipped by God in the state and
[1:00:26] now we've entered the land hallelujah
[1:00:28] but we're going to recognize that
[1:00:29] there's squatters there's a devil
[1:00:31] sitting on every divine promise of God
[1:00:33] to try and stop you I mean obtaining the
[1:00:36] promise that is rightfully yours I mean
[1:00:38] as as as God told Joshua every place
[1:00:42] your foot shall tread I give it unto you
[1:00:44] you have to go and possess he says the
[1:00:46] whole land is yours but you were to go
[1:00:48] make it yours amen so now every divine
[1:00:51] promise hallelujah amen is yours but you
[1:00:54] got to go get it so so in heavenly armed
[1:00:56] amen we've been to the land now now this
[1:00:59] land we know as Christ it's the word
[1:01:01] brother Branham says and proving his
[1:01:03] word 1964 he says the voice of one
[1:01:05] crying in the wilderness prepare the way
[1:01:07] of the Lord and make his paths straight
[1:01:09] was he was he preparing the way of of
[1:01:13] the word then that the word might be
[1:01:15] made manifest how old are you don't you
[1:01:16] see in shadow stop here for a minute and
[1:01:18] the last days has got to be a place
[1:01:20] repaired for the word to be made
[1:01:22] manifest which is the Bride of Christ
[1:01:23] and we're now living by the evidence of
[1:01:26] the new land amen the son of man so the
[1:01:29] son of man the word is the new land but
[1:01:31] you have to go in and take every promise
[1:01:33] I mean so that's why you know but you
[1:01:36] see the devil his job is to stop you
[1:01:39] obtaining the promise that is yours now
[1:01:43] Joshua was told now we are going to get
[1:01:46] to Abel's land but I wanted background
[1:01:48] this now Joshua was told that no there
[1:01:52] shall not be any man shall be able to
[1:01:54] stand you all the days of thy life as I
[1:01:57] was with my
[1:01:57] so I shall be with thee I'll not fail
[1:01:59] thee nor forsake thee now why did God
[1:02:02] tell them that no man would be able to
[1:02:04] stand before him all the days of his
[1:02:05] life is because men would try and
[1:02:07] withstand I mean try and stop Israel
[1:02:09] possessing their land now we know we are
[1:02:12] not here to possess a physical land but
[1:02:15] a spiritual land a spiritual inheritance
[1:02:17] so that that those that I was standing
[1:02:20] US and not men but they are spirits
[1:02:23] they're demon powers but you've been
[1:02:25] equipped in the south to dis possess him
[1:02:27] and take your inheritance in the Word of
[1:02:28] God hallelujah now brother Bram is as
[1:02:31] when he had the vision of the hand
[1:02:33] coming down and pointing to Joshua 1 2 9
[1:02:35] and he says he's to way I mean I mean
[1:02:38] 2/3 of the way over to Canaan sphere
[1:02:40] land and every promise laid in the land
[1:02:42] he was walking on the Kings Highway and
[1:02:44] some of the people were afraid because
[1:02:46] he also feels that there was a black
[1:02:48] mamba snake there was death was was was
[1:02:50] slithering around on me on the on the
[1:02:53] highway and he had a vision there that
[1:02:56] this that this Mamba came out and tried
[1:02:59] to bite Yvonne now we know when a Mamba
[1:03:00] a black mamba bite someone its death
[1:03:03] amen it's death and they're very
[1:03:05] aggressive creatures you know and and
[1:03:08] sometimes snakes can be very small but
[1:03:10] very poisonous
[1:03:11] you know we saw did one in the Kruger
[1:03:13] was a Boomslang snake it was about yay
[1:03:15] long but they're deadly snakes they
[1:03:18] don't look like much but they're deadly
[1:03:20] one bite will you're done basically if
[1:03:22] you can't get anti-venom so the devil
[1:03:24] doesn't always come along as some great
[1:03:26] big something but there's poison behind
[1:03:28] his fangs right and you got to be very
[1:03:31] careful I mean because death is moving
[1:03:33] in this age I meant by but thanks be to
[1:03:36] God we have something to overcome that
[1:03:38] death now in that snake when that Mamba
[1:03:40] tried to bribe a bite brother branham in
[1:03:43] the dream I mean it tried to get closer
[1:03:44] to him and eventually it came to a point
[1:03:46] where it couldn't get any closer to him
[1:03:48] why is that because there was a power
[1:03:49] there was a force enter my baptism the
[1:03:51] Holy Ghost that kept this away I'm a
[1:03:54] that's the only way we can go and take
[1:03:56] every promise of our land as ever
[1:03:58] God Himself is present I mean he is in
[1:04:01] US but then he had to now speak he had
[1:04:04] to speak to that that that mama to bind
[1:04:07] it I mean you've got to speak to your
[1:04:09] Mountain
[1:04:10] I mean you just can't say well as me no
[1:04:12] you were to say uh and heavenly Amma
[1:04:14] I've been to the land
[1:04:16] I've been equipped to overcome in the
[1:04:18] south I mean God has given me the power
[1:04:20] hallelujah
[1:04:21] this word is living in me Christ Himself
[1:04:23] Ananda is in his bride I'm equipped
[1:04:26] hallelujah I am able I mean so then you
[1:04:29] know you've got to speak to your storm
[1:04:31] you've got to speak to the devil that's
[1:04:33] fighting you all fighting your family
[1:04:34] you've got to address it I mean cuz you
[1:04:37] have the power and you I mean you have
[1:04:39] the authority to do it I mean as the
[1:04:42] Prophet was given the authority you can
[1:04:44] bind death in every spirit under I mean
[1:04:46] combine this and all the ones under it
[1:04:48] hallelujah and then so and then so
[1:04:50] brother says I bind you in the name of
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ and that and that mama
[1:04:53] turned into a glass like a tempest and
[1:04:55] sign and the life went out of it
[1:04:57] hallelujah and they said that I may know
[1:05:00] I lost you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:01] it came back to life in and then he
[1:05:02] bound them again just to show now you
[1:05:05] say well that's the Prophet no that's
[1:05:07] not just him I mean we got to understand
[1:05:11] wait can we have this back up again now
[1:05:16] brother Brown would speak he would speak
[1:05:20] in the in the church age book and he
[1:05:25] said now the key was given to me of the
[1:05:27] Lord says when he's identifying each
[1:05:29] messenger for the age but he says now
[1:05:31] the key was given to me the Lord whereby
[1:05:32] I was able to determine the messenger
[1:05:36] for each age as a most scriptural one in
[1:05:38] fact it might be the whole Keystone of
[1:05:40] the Bible it is the revelation that God
[1:05:42] never changes and that his ways are as
[1:05:45] unchangeable as he is and Hebrews 13:8
[1:05:47] it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:49] today and forever now a key stone a key
[1:05:53] stone if you look at old old buildings
[1:05:55] this stone here is the key stone and it
[1:05:58] actually holds the arch together
[1:06:00] it holds everything together if you pull
[1:06:02] that stone out the whole thing will
[1:06:04] collapse so he sees that that this is
[1:06:07] actually the thing that holds the Bible
[1:06:09] together this is the key stone the most
[1:06:11] important element of the scriptures that
[1:06:14] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:06:17] and forever that he does not change and
[1:06:19] even the definition of key stoners as
[1:06:21] the central principle
[1:06:23] on which all else depends that's what he
[1:06:27] says I mean I mean there's the
[1:06:28] dictionary definition so he says it's
[1:06:30] the keystone of the entire Bible that
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:06:34] and forever so the same God that was in
[1:06:37] the prophet as in the bride
[1:06:39] the same anointing that was on Elijah
[1:06:40] fell upon Elijah right so the same
[1:06:43] authority given to the Prophet over the
[1:06:45] devil the bride has the same authority I
[1:06:47] mean she has the same power to bind or
[1:06:50] to loose just as the Prophet now it says
[1:06:52] in 2nd Corinthians 4 he says we having
[1:06:55] the same spirit of faith according his
[1:06:57] room I believed and therefore I have
[1:07:00] spoken ye also believe and therefore
[1:07:03] speak hallelujah so we have the same
[1:07:06] spirit of faith amen hallelujah so
[1:07:09] therefore we believe in therefore speak
[1:07:11] you've got to address your enemy amen
[1:07:16] now he would say at the start of his
[1:07:20] ministry when he would relate when the
[1:07:21] angel Lord came to him and commissioned
[1:07:23] him to take the gifts of divine healing
[1:07:25] to the world he says this in 1948 at thy
[1:07:28] word and Phoenix he says you have never
[1:07:31] seen them so we have never seen them
[1:07:33] come by by humbly and appreciative oh
[1:07:36] that's where God moves right in that
[1:07:39] channel it's wonderful isn't it
[1:07:41] certainly God is making up as jewel you
[1:07:43] understand what I'm speaking of now now
[1:07:45] now shall we bow our heads now for
[1:07:47] prayer father realizing that I'd be
[1:07:50] afraid to step into this realm now
[1:07:51] without you would would hold my hand now
[1:07:55] my mind is going back to around two
[1:07:57] years ago when in the room that night
[1:07:59] the angel the Lord came walking in there
[1:08:01] and said you've been born in this world
[1:08:03] to take a gift of divine healing to the
[1:08:04] people many will not believe you yet
[1:08:07] many will if you'll be sincere and will
[1:08:09] get the people to believe you not even
[1:08:11] cancer shall stand before your prayer
[1:08:13] angel of God I do not see you but I know
[1:08:16] you're standing near please don't know
[1:08:18] us my heart and know how I love these
[1:08:21] people see he was taught by God if
[1:08:23] you're sincere and get the people to
[1:08:25] believe you now why would he have to get
[1:08:28] the people to believe you because of the
[1:08:29] people did not believe him then unbelief
[1:08:32] would hinder the moving of the Spirit of
[1:08:33] God
[1:08:33] and it's very easy to say oh I believe
[1:08:35] in Jesus but
[1:08:36] he I mean he's in his word presently
[1:08:39] here now I mean so even even as Jesus
[1:08:42] when he was a Nazareth it says in
[1:08:44] Matthew 13 58 and many things and he did
[1:08:48] not many mighty works there because of
[1:08:50] their unbelief they were in that they
[1:08:52] had their synagogues they believed in
[1:08:54] Jehovah God but Jehovah God became flesh
[1:08:56] as Jesus Christ Jehovah the Old
[1:08:59] Testament as Jesus of the news that same
[1:09:00] God they claimed to believe was standing
[1:09:02] in the inmense made flesh but because of
[1:09:04] their unbelief he couldn't do many
[1:09:06] mighty works now in Exodus 19 and 9 and
[1:09:09] the Lord said unto Moses i lo I I come
[1:09:13] unto the in a thick cloud that the
[1:09:15] people may hear when I speak under the
[1:09:18] am believed thee forever and Moses told
[1:09:21] the words of the Lord unto the people he
[1:09:24] said why would why would God come to
[1:09:25] Moses and say I want the people to
[1:09:27] believe you forever because God was
[1:09:29] going to speak through that vessel and
[1:09:31] so God wanted to supernaturally
[1:09:32] vindicate Moses that the people would
[1:09:34] believe the words of Moses and that they
[1:09:37] were not his words but they were God's
[1:09:39] words now it is the same thing today God
[1:09:41] I'd say over Vindicator brother Browns
[1:09:43] ministry Amen that that we would be able
[1:09:46] to have we would recognize that was not
[1:09:49] his thoughts or his interpretation of
[1:09:51] the scripture but it was the author
[1:09:53] himself the Lord Jesus Christ saying
[1:09:54] this is what my word says it means so
[1:09:57] now as as we read their brother Browns
[1:10:01] Commission he said he was told nothing
[1:10:03] would stand before his prayers now we
[1:10:06] actually must recognize that as not just
[1:10:09] for the prophet that's for the Bride of
[1:10:11] Christ I mean it's also for the bride
[1:10:14] because the same Living God that was
[1:10:15] veiled in the Prophet is now on the
[1:10:17] bride doing the same works hallelujah we
[1:10:20] must recognize that you've got to know
[1:10:22] who you are you're to recognize what
[1:10:24] you've got I mean not all one day know
[1:10:26] what you've got right now maybe brother
[1:10:28] I see when the weakness of Christian
[1:10:29] gets on their knees the king of house
[1:10:31] shakes while they I say and they take
[1:10:33] the kingdom of hell a time or two yes
[1:10:35] I'm not very strong in faith that's fine
[1:10:37] you'll still shake hell ain't meant you
[1:10:40] got to recognize what God has given you
[1:10:41] and you say Lord thank you it's mine how
[1:10:44] do I claim
[1:10:45] your name hallelujah thank you Lord I
[1:10:47] mean like I said to you last year you
[1:10:49] got to make a list have you made your
[1:10:52] list have you made your list I've got my
[1:10:55] list I wonder what's on the list
[1:10:59] well as it manifests you'll see it
[1:11:02] hallelujah amen so we you know so
[1:11:07] brother bran was asked a question 1963
[1:11:11] he was asked a question with the Bride
[1:11:13] of Christ heaven ministry before the
[1:11:15] rapture his answer is sure that's what's
[1:11:17] going on right now the Bride of Christ
[1:11:19] certainly it's the message of the hour
[1:11:20] see the Bride of Christ she consists of
[1:11:23] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:11:25] and pastors is that right that's the
[1:11:27] Bride of Christ she's got a ministry
[1:11:28] great ministry the Minister of the hour
[1:11:31] but it'll be so humble so the bride has
[1:11:33] a ministry right now and you're part of
[1:11:35] that ministry say I'm not five fold but
[1:11:37] you're part of the body of Christ I mean
[1:11:39] even you here you can create an
[1:11:41] atmosphere of faith where God can come
[1:11:43] down and change your life how that your
[1:11:44] amens your prayers how you sing how you
[1:11:47] worship you can bring God on the scene
[1:11:49] and change this whole service change
[1:11:50] someone's life forever
[1:11:51] you're very powerful in the eyes of God
[1:11:53] amen God will stop listening to an
[1:11:55] archangel to hear your prayer
[1:11:57] Ilia because you're more important to
[1:11:59] him than Gabriel or Michael or one of
[1:12:02] the great angels whoever it is you're
[1:12:03] more important because he never died for
[1:12:05] them but he died for you I mean he rants
[1:12:08] some doing ever rent some them
[1:12:09] hallelujah so he will say that quite
[1:12:12] Gabriel quite Gabriel I'm listening to

[1:12:19] to talk my brides talking to me shush
[1:12:22] hallelujah of course they're good angels
[1:12:24] so they will say yes sir yes and they
[1:12:27] will so we we must recognize the
[1:12:29] ministry we have the devil always try
[1:12:32] and belittle what you have but never let
[1:12:34] him we have to look through the eyes of
[1:12:36] God at who we are and that doesn't make
[1:12:38] us proud that should make us more humble
[1:12:40] and more thankful Lord if you take me
[1:12:42] from the gutter of death and sin lift me
[1:12:44] up into heavenly places and wash me and
[1:12:46] cleanse me and change me make me a new
[1:12:48] creature hallelujah shouldn't that make
[1:12:50] us more humble and appreciative or thank
[1:12:52] you Lord Jesus
[1:12:54] hallelujah now he would also say the
[1:12:57] lady I see in church
[1:12:58] the church age book he said then God
[1:13:00] sent Wesley and he was the voice with
[1:13:03] the word in his day the people who took
[1:13:06] his revelation from God became the
[1:13:07] living epistles written own of all men
[1:13:10] for the generation when the Methodists
[1:13:12] failed God raised up others and so it
[1:13:15] has gone on through the ages until in
[1:13:17] this last day there's another people in
[1:13:19] the land hello people in the land under
[1:13:21] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:13:23] to the final age so the same same Christ
[1:13:25] that came to the Prophet that same Lord
[1:13:27] Jesus comes to you and he manifests the
[1:13:30] same word through you hallelujah now
[1:13:32] this is done I mean the only way that
[1:13:35] this can be done as is the fulfilling of
[1:13:37] Revelations ten eight to eleven I mean
[1:13:40] with John we understand as a symbol in
[1:13:42] the book am I going too fast I really
[1:13:45] want you to get this because you're to
[1:13:46] say and heavenly armor I've entered the
[1:13:48] land the battle belongs to Lord I've
[1:13:51] been equipped for this hour I've been
[1:13:52] made for this hour been ordained for
[1:13:54] this hour every devil every weapons
[1:13:56] going to be at my feet I'm going to be
[1:13:57] conqueror I mean Christ Paul said we're
[1:14:00] more than conquerors through him that
[1:14:01] loved us how are you gonna say this
[1:14:03] morning I'm more than a conqueror you
[1:14:05] know we say well the devil's big he
[1:14:07] moves in shadows I don't know how to
[1:14:08] fight him he'll give you God will give
[1:14:10] you the ability he'll give me the
[1:14:12] revelation
[1:14:13] I mean how to conquered how to get out
[1:14:15] of the pit you maybe and even this
[1:14:16] morning
[1:14:17] Allu you saw it's the only way that this
[1:14:19] can be fulfilled is the fulfillment of
[1:14:21] revelations 10 8 to 11 we know all
[1:14:23] scripture must be fulfilled all
[1:14:25] scripture is going to be fulfilled so
[1:14:27] there's gonna be a be a people on the
[1:14:29] earth that become one with the revealed
[1:14:31] word I mean and then they begin to
[1:14:33] prophesy again so they become one with
[1:14:35] the open book which is Christ and they
[1:14:37] speak the contents of the book amen to
[1:14:39] tear down the your Satan's Kingdom
[1:14:42] hallelujah amen as as John was told I
[1:14:46] mean take the book eat the book become
[1:14:49] one with the word don't just talk about
[1:14:50] it don't just just just discuss it
[1:14:53] become one with him become one with
[1:14:55] Christ li to manifest in your being
[1:14:57] I'll let the word let the word put on
[1:15:00] flesh in you I mean as Christians we're
[1:15:02] more than just to talk about being a
[1:15:04] Christian I mean but to be a Christian
[1:15:06] the only way you can be a Christian is
[1:15:08] of Christ Himself comes and dwells in
[1:15:10] you
[1:15:10] and he's the Christian and you you can't
[1:15:12] do it in yourself we must understand
[1:15:14] that man has miserably failed trying to
[1:15:17] be a Christian man has miserably failed
[1:15:19] because they've tried to do it in their
[1:15:20] own ability if I just try harder if I do
[1:15:23] this if I do this you can't do nothing
[1:15:25] you've just got to surrender and die and
[1:15:26] let him live everyday oh now that's real
[1:15:30] victory hallelujah and and and the Lord
[1:15:34] told us to do it and the reason he told
[1:15:36] us to do it is because he gave the
[1:15:37] ability to do it he never put something
[1:15:40] on his people and says you can't fulfill
[1:15:41] this hallelujah I can do all things
[1:15:45] through Christ which strengthens me
[1:15:47] that's more than a nice Instagram pickle
[1:15:49] something to put on the fridge it's a
[1:15:50] reality hallelujah now so we hit a bit
[1:15:55] where we're here in the fulfillment of
[1:15:56] prophecy now Abel we read in Revelations
[1:16:00] I mean sorry Hebrews 11 and for by faith
[1:16:03] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:16:05] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[1:16:08] witness that he was righteous God
[1:16:10] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:16:14] being dead yet speaketh now Abel Abel
[1:16:17] had a revelation that it was a blood set
[1:16:20] in the garden his gift was a
[1:16:23] manifestation of what was in God's mind
[1:16:25] that the Lamb of God will come and take
[1:16:26] away the sin of the world
[1:16:27] now Genesis we know is the sea chapter
[1:16:30] so everything starts off in a seed form
[1:16:32] and then it grows to a great big tree in
[1:16:34] the Book of Revelations everything
[1:16:35] starts in Genesis so we have a principle
[1:16:40] in the in the book well in Genesis 4
[1:16:44] here where Cain kills Abel the the
[1:16:49] wicked religious destroy the righteous
[1:16:51] now it's spirits and it's spirits to try
[1:16:55] and destroy holy ghost worship a true
[1:16:59] spiritual union with God that's what the
[1:17:01] Antichrist spirit tries to do see see
[1:17:03] the Antichrist spirit doesn't try and
[1:17:05] make even atheists it wants people to be
[1:17:08] religious because the devil Satan wants
[1:17:10] to be worshipped he says I'll be like
[1:17:12] the Most High in Isaiah so to be like
[1:17:14] the most high he has to be worship like
[1:17:16] the Most High he all is as a mimic of
[1:17:19] who God is he's trying to mimic God so
[1:17:22] so the Antichrist
[1:17:24] what it does is it tries to destroy a
[1:17:27] mean holy ghost worship Amy now let's go
[1:17:31] to know we know that spirits don't die
[1:17:34] the people may die but the spirit on
[1:17:36] them that manifest that lives on their
[1:17:39] brother Burman saying in in the god of
[1:17:41] this evil age he says as she is part of
[1:17:44] the groom true to him in every point
[1:17:46] waiting and waiting the wedding uniting
[1:17:49] not at the ecumenical council but in the
[1:17:51] sky at the wedding supper she has been
[1:17:54] given he says this is for our own church
[1:17:56] he's been given and revealed to her the
[1:17:57] seven sealed mystery of the Bible see
[1:17:59] she sees the folly of the of the
[1:18:02] deceiver so every so very close to the
[1:18:05] truth
[1:18:06] that almost deceived the elected she
[1:18:09] sees it see the two opposing spirits at
[1:18:12] work in this evil age can you see it
[1:18:14] each every each very religious Cain and
[1:18:17] Abel spirits again coming to their heads
[1:18:20] still same as they started one
[1:18:22] worshiping by beauty and by knowledge
[1:18:25] about education by science and by ethics
[1:18:27] the other one by faith of the revelation
[1:18:30] of the Word of God
[1:18:31] both them standing right in this
[1:18:33] building this morning he says that's
[1:18:36] right what's he saying cuz those spirits
[1:18:37] have come to unto this age one by ethics
[1:18:40] and beauty and knowledge by education by
[1:18:42] science the other by revelation of the
[1:18:45] word of God well what do you mean by by
[1:18:48] by by ethics well it's ethically right
[1:18:52] morally right to be a Christian so its
[1:18:55] reason comes in well I should because
[1:18:57] it's good you know I don't want to be
[1:18:58] like those people I want to be good so
[1:19:00] it's oh it's ethically right what about
[1:19:03] by science
[1:19:04] well people try new science to be
[1:19:05] believers I spend before I met the Lord
[1:19:08] because I studied biochemistry at
[1:19:10] university I read creation science till
[1:19:12] I could find it no more to read nothing
[1:19:15] wrong with it but it didn't help me meet
[1:19:16] him I learned about his crashing it was
[1:19:19] excel in terrestrial hallelujah
[1:19:27] this Bible became a living reality
[1:19:29] hallelujah so it's all good to know
[1:19:32] about creation and how God's hand
[1:19:34] because God is in nature if you look
[1:19:36] long enough you
[1:19:37] right he's a nature they mean but you
[1:19:40] got to meet him
[1:19:41] they met and and the other by faith of
[1:19:44] the revelation of the Word of God he is
[1:19:47] both him and standing right here this
[1:19:48] morning now let's go to let's go to get
[1:19:53] let's go to Genesis 4 and 1 let's just
[1:19:56] read this little bit I have this thing
[1:20:16] ok good
[1:20:17] and Adam knew his wife and she conceived
[1:20:22] and bare Cain and said I've gotten a man
[1:20:24] from the Lord
[1:20:25] we know all life comes from God yep and
[1:20:28] she bear his brother Abel and Abel was a
[1:20:30] keeper of the sheep but Cain was a
[1:20:32] tiller of the ground and the process of
[1:20:34] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[1:20:36] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[1:20:38] unto the Lord so there's something in
[1:20:39] these people to worship because then men
[1:20:41] to worship something you'll worship some
[1:20:44] people just worship themselves
[1:20:45] you see Instagram and all that yo
[1:20:47] YouTube bloggers that is worshiping
[1:20:49] themselves it's all vanity projects that
[1:20:51] yo most of it see so you worship
[1:20:55] yourself a job your family a car some
[1:20:58] hobby people give their lives to such
[1:21:00] small things I mean but we should be
[1:21:03] worshipers of God and spirit and truth
[1:21:05] so so they're both worshipers now and
[1:21:08] Abel also brought of the first things of
[1:21:11] his flock and the fat thereof and the
[1:21:14] Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
[1:21:17] offering now it's not recorded that that
[1:21:20] that their parents were Adam and Eve
[1:21:22] told them anything about what happened
[1:21:24] in the garden but something moved in
[1:21:26] them they have to worship this God that
[1:21:29] that created them now Cain Cain's altar
[1:21:33] he brought his fruits he brought his
[1:21:36] works of his hands his own ability but
[1:21:41] it doesn't have any life in it it just
[1:21:44] had it it just that plant life I didn't
[1:21:45] have any animal life didn't have any
[1:21:47] blood member the scripture is without
[1:21:49] the shedding of blood there's no
[1:21:50] remission of sin and people will try and
[1:21:52] take the blood out of the gospel the
[1:21:55] reality of the blood they'll just
[1:21:56] explain it away talk it away oh you
[1:21:58] don't need that you don't need a real
[1:22:00] birth I mean what is that that's a cane
[1:22:02] spirit try to take the reality of the
[1:22:05] Holy Ghost out of the message I mean
[1:22:07] this message is called to restore us to
[1:22:08] original Pentecost and I'm not talking
[1:22:11] about denomination Pentecost as
[1:22:13] experience where God came in 12th of
[1:22:15] this church and manifested his word out
[1:22:17] to the aged I mean we may not be there
[1:22:19] in the 1st and the beginning of the
[1:22:20] church but at the end I mean a we've got
[1:22:23] a work to fulfill we're going to work to
[1:22:24] manifest upon the earth Holly we're not
[1:22:27] here just to try and go back into
[1:22:28] history no God is here to fulfill his
[1:22:31] word and he's put you to fulfill it here
[1:22:33] so I'd say Lord take my life make it by
[1:22:35] and come and live hallelujah so here he
[1:22:38] was he had his beautiful fruit because
[1:22:40] of why cuz of knowledge it was
[1:22:42] reasonable to him I should offer
[1:22:43] something to this God he was a believer
[1:22:45] he wasn't an unbeliever he was a
[1:22:48] believer right and enable Abel broader
[1:22:52] brought the first things of his flock
[1:22:54] now something struck Abel I don't know
[1:22:58] what had been like but no doubt you know
[1:22:59] he would have seen this lamb be birth
[1:23:01] maybe help the mama I don't know would
[1:23:04] you know would lead it out into pasture
[1:23:06] look after it and there would have been
[1:23:07] other lambs around but something struck
[1:23:10] him I've got to take the slam he looked
[1:23:14] into the eyes of that lamb this is just
[1:23:16] me and something struck him said this
[1:23:18] one is an offering he'd never heard
[1:23:20] about offerings before I don't know but
[1:23:22] something that I'm seeing I've got to
[1:23:23] take this one he picks it up Cain's got
[1:23:26] his beautiful altar all the flowers and
[1:23:28] the fruit and all these things that
[1:23:29] looks over so lovely
[1:23:30] here comes brother am said he found a
[1:23:32] vine or something he said I don't know
[1:23:34] if they had him to make ropes in those
[1:23:35] days he took a like like a vine tied it
[1:23:38] around me I'm lambs Nick and and he
[1:23:41] began to lead it to the altar just as
[1:23:43] Christ was laid up Calvary and then he
[1:23:46] took him and then you know there's no
[1:23:47] record of them having any kind of metal
[1:23:49] so he took a sharp knife and he laid the
[1:23:51] lamb down who seen a lamb be killed
[1:23:53] who's actually seen that you want to see
[1:23:57] something you go see that say what
[1:24:00] because you'll understand
[1:24:02] the penalty of sin that our Lord paid
[1:24:04] was horrible and he was more than just a
[1:24:07] lamb being you know his throat being
[1:24:09] slit he has marred more than any man but
[1:24:11] you see the bleeding of the lamb the
[1:24:12] crying is its life is going out some of
[1:24:15] us need to spend some more time on some
[1:24:16] farms I think you know you know but but
[1:24:20] he took that sharp stone he said begin
[1:24:22] the hacking hack on the throat of that
[1:24:24] lamb and until finally his blood was
[1:24:26] released and its life was poured out it
[1:24:28] doesn't look pretty
[1:24:29] neither is that when a people are struck
[1:24:32] by a revelation and give their life to
[1:24:33] God snorting crying boo-hooing ain't
[1:24:37] meant pouring themselves out it's a mess
[1:24:38] at birth anywhere is a mess amen but
[1:24:41] when he was giving that lamb God said I
[1:24:44] can identify myself and that boys
[1:24:46] worship because that lamb is a
[1:24:48] revelation of who I am holy it's the
[1:24:50] same thing with you and I when God could
[1:24:52] look down at you and say I can identify
[1:24:54] myself than those people because their
[1:24:56] worship as me
[1:24:57] holy their life was me how they dresses
[1:24:59] me how they speak as me how they how
[1:25:01] they treat each other it's me hallelujah
[1:25:05] amen - he had so it says that that God
[1:25:08] had respect unto Abel and to his
[1:25:10] offering now we read in Hebrews 11 he
[1:25:14] had a more excellent sacrifice than that
[1:25:16] of K so Cain's sacrifice was excellent
[1:25:20] it wasn't haphazard it wasn't lazy it
[1:25:22] was sincere it was serious they knew
[1:25:25] that something something moved on them
[1:25:27] we've got off of something so that we
[1:25:28] can have peace with God so he didn't he
[1:25:31] did just haphazardly take it or leave it
[1:25:33] here you know here's some oranges or
[1:25:35] apples throw it down on some rock here
[1:25:37] it is you know blase he was serious but
[1:25:41] it wasn't according to the revelation of
[1:25:43] God it was by his own understanding and
[1:25:46] we can't be believers because of our own
[1:25:48] understanding of the Bible you know the
[1:25:51] one of the most dangerous things I hear
[1:25:53] as people say the message makes sense
[1:25:58] well the Bible makes it now that's
[1:26:00] dangerous because that's just
[1:26:01] intellectual reasoning of course the
[1:26:04] Bible makes sense the mystery of God's
[1:26:05] finished in this day right although we
[1:26:08] know what the Bible says from serpent
[1:26:10] seed all the way down to the messenger
[1:26:11] and the ladder rain
[1:26:12] mother brown said this in time minister
[1:26:13] I mean I mean messenger will reveal that
[1:26:16] so it's not it's not a surprise I mean
[1:26:19] where someone can come and just show you
[1:26:21] every type and shadow through the Bible
[1:26:23] because the books open but when science
[1:26:26] is that just makes sense now that's
[1:26:27] dangerous because intellectual reasoning
[1:26:30] as opposed to revelation amen
[1:26:33] it should make sense but don't just stop
[1:26:35] there do you keep walking till you meet
[1:26:37] the lamb until you meet the author of
[1:26:39] the word himself I mean because remember
[1:26:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:43] forever if the Apostles could meet him I
[1:26:45] could meet him maybe a brother Brown can
[1:26:47] meet him I can meet him oh yeah you know
[1:26:50] you can have visitations of angels in
[1:26:52] your heart you know there's more
[1:26:54] visitations of angels and the New
[1:26:56] Testament than the old and just didn't
[1:26:58] quit visiting just because Jesus shed
[1:26:59] his blood upon the earth amen
[1:27:03] so we don't just want to stay we don't
[1:27:05] just want to stop there and say well it
[1:27:06] makes sense no you got to meet him and
[1:27:09] when you meet him it changes your life
[1:27:11] forever it changes how you think you can
[1:27:13] actually operate in the environment
[1:27:15] you're in because the one who allowed
[1:27:17] the environment to come into being the
[1:27:18] one who created it actually comes out
[1:27:20] says I'm gonna be your guide through
[1:27:21] this wilderness hallelujah amen I did
[1:27:27] now Abel I mean I mean Cain it says but
[1:27:32] unto Cain and to his offering God did
[1:27:34] not have respect and Cain was very wroth
[1:27:36] and his countenance fell he got mad he
[1:27:39] got offended he got offended at God God
[1:27:42] why didn't you receive my worship let's
[1:27:46] see it's all about attitude if thou
[1:27:48] doest well but in God but yea but then
[1:27:51] the Lord spake under Cain that's there's
[1:27:53] no record on the scripture that the Lord
[1:27:54] ever spoke table and then the Lord asked
[1:27:57] Cain why are you angry why are you Roth
[1:27:59] and why is our countenance fallen well I
[1:28:02] mean yeah wait we'll go here if thou
[1:28:07] doest well shalt thou not be accepted
[1:28:08] and if thou doest not well sin lies at
[1:28:11] the door and unto these show and to thee
[1:28:14] shall be his desire and thou shalt rule
[1:28:17] over him so basically saying Cain just
[1:28:21] do like your brother did you'll be
[1:28:22] accepted see God gives you about an
[1:28:24] opportunity
[1:28:26] whosoever will let him come all the
[1:28:29] company or no wise cast out but it
[1:28:31] wasn't in cane to come and we'll go into
[1:28:35] that later it wasn't in him to come and
[1:28:39] then so Cain talked with his brother
[1:28:41] Abel and it came to pass that when they
[1:28:43] were in the field that Cain rose up
[1:28:44] against Abel and slew him so here's the
[1:28:47] spirit in the beginning religious
[1:28:50] worship God but hates the true worshiper
[1:28:53] that God receives and is not willing to
[1:28:56] surrender their will to God's will that
[1:28:59] God will receive them as well my Lord
[1:29:02] Jesus help us right now amen so then
[1:29:06] what happens Cain kills Abel Abel you
[1:29:10] can't worship like this why did you
[1:29:12] offer a lamb tell me why why do you do
[1:29:14] like I did we're family we should be
[1:29:16] doing this together why did you do why'd
[1:29:18] you take a lamb as hideous all the blood
[1:29:19] everywhere it was all over you and all
[1:29:21] over hallelujah I mean the blood of the
[1:29:23] offering went all over the altar all
[1:29:25] over you I mean that same smell of the
[1:29:27] lamb was all over yours it was all messy
[1:29:30] hallelujah same thing with you and I the
[1:29:32] blood that was in our sacrifice comes
[1:29:33] all over us
[1:29:34] that life that was in the blood comes
[1:29:36] all over us hallelujah the smell the
[1:29:37] lamb comes all over us hallelujah that
[1:29:39] when you see Abel you see the lamb
[1:29:41] hallelujah you see that same life Halle
[1:29:43] that innocent life comes upon him
[1:29:45] hallelujah ha but you shouldn't worship
[1:29:48] that way let's me see look I had this
[1:29:50] fruit like my best my best fruit it was
[1:29:53] perfectly shaped everything was
[1:29:54] perfectly right why didn't you just do
[1:29:57] like me he was jealous because one had
[1:30:02] God come down and say yes you're my son
[1:30:07] you more than Adam son go back another
[1:30:09] step you more than Adam son you're my
[1:30:11] son and that's why I moved on your heart
[1:30:13] that you would recognize
[1:30:15] hallelujah then it takes the shedding of
[1:30:16] blood parlor this is why hallelujah but
[1:30:20] a but Cain was jealous because he stood
[1:30:25] there do this thing I guess we got hope
[1:30:28] now he's jealous
[1:30:31] and so that spirit now comes and tries
[1:30:34] to stop the moving of the Holy Ghost it
[1:30:37] tries to just make us have a form and
[1:30:39] become formal cold dead and powerless
[1:30:42] and brother and says God hates a
[1:30:44] powerless Church because that's not
[1:30:47] that's not what he died for he didn't
[1:30:49] die just for a society of people just to
[1:30:51] talk about things and live the same kind
[1:30:52] of life he died that a people would be
[1:30:54] transformed I meant that the life that
[1:30:57] was in the blood of Jesus Christ would
[1:30:58] come unto you the Holy Ghost and would
[1:31:00] transform your life and make you a new
[1:31:02] creature in Him and saying that we're
[1:31:04] new creatures is more than just a
[1:31:06] buzzword or something nice to say it's a
[1:31:08] reality I mean once when some of us were
[1:31:10] with drunks and lost and caught up with
[1:31:13] all kind of spirits and and darkness and
[1:31:15] depression and brokenness and whatever
[1:31:17] it was but then God came and he says I'm
[1:31:20] not just gonna patch you up I'm gonna
[1:31:22] transform you that you're actually a new
[1:31:24] creation hallelujah amen and when you I
[1:31:29] don't know the person I once was died
[1:31:32] hallelujah it's like when Abraham became
[1:31:35] Abraham he received a new name because a
[1:31:38] new life was living write a name
[1:31:40] represents a life so Abraham he had
[1:31:43] Ishmael here - male but then when he
[1:31:46] received a new birth and became Abraham
[1:31:48] and type he you know he received a new
[1:31:50] birth and type became Abraham then he
[1:31:52] has Isaac and God says to him Abraham
[1:31:55] take thy son thy only son and go and go
[1:31:59] offer him on the mountain go well hold
[1:32:01] on God but there's a schmao he even
[1:32:04] looks a bit like him but when God looked
[1:32:08] down he says no Ishmael as Abraham's son
[1:32:11] it's not Abraham son
[1:32:13] I cannot attribute Ishmael to Abraham
[1:32:16] because it was Abraham's son Abraham is
[1:32:19] now a new creature that man Abraham died
[1:32:22] he's now Abraham so the works of his
[1:32:25] flesh are not attributed to him anymore
[1:32:27] because he's a new creature hallelujah
[1:32:30] so the things we once did they may even
[1:32:33] haunt us but when God looks down he says
[1:32:36] I do not attribute that to you because
[1:32:38] you know a new creature and me I've made
[1:32:40] you a new creature so those things
[1:32:42] I don't i cannot reconcile them with you
[1:32:45] with them hallelujah amen if god looked
[1:32:49] down and said that about abraham he says
[1:32:52] that about you
[1:32:53] hallelujah but but these things are
[1:32:57] still around me I'm still haunted by
[1:32:58] their memories
[1:32:59] Ishmael was still in the camp but God
[1:33:02] says I don't attribute this day brahim
[1:33:03] that's Abraham son glory hallelujah
[1:33:08] I like that don't you Amen so he rose up
[1:33:12] Cain rose up killed his brother and slew
[1:33:15] him and then the Lord said unto Cain
[1:33:17] where is like where is Abel thy brother
[1:33:19] and Cain said to him I know not am I my
[1:33:24] brother's keeper keeper we are our
[1:33:28] brother's keeper the answer actually is
[1:33:30] the issue I Cain you're your brother's
[1:33:32] keeper he's part of the family of God
[1:33:35] you're actually responsible for his
[1:33:37] welfare maybe not to be some selfish and
[1:33:40] with looking person who doesn't care
[1:33:42] about no one else know that was casing
[1:33:44] am I my brother's keeper
[1:33:45] yes you are your brother's keeper and
[1:33:47] then we are here for one another we're
[1:33:49] not here for ourselves I mean we're not
[1:33:51] here to see well what can I get only no
[1:33:53] God what can you pour through to help
[1:33:56] someone else that's like you know the
[1:33:58] scripture says those that are friendly
[1:34:00] have friends right so in order to our
[1:34:04] friends you be friendly it's real simple
[1:34:07] you want to have friends be friendly to
[1:34:10] everyone around you
[1:34:11] hello you'll create an atmosphere around
[1:34:13] you you have such a personality people
[1:34:15] say I want to hang out with that guy or
[1:34:17] that girl why cuz they're friendly
[1:34:19] somebody's old no one loves me no one's
[1:34:21] have talked to me are you friendly their
[1:34:24] respective of how they're treating you
[1:34:25] just be friendly and eventually those
[1:34:28] those bits of ice will thaw and warm up
[1:34:31] to you hallelujah
[1:34:33] I meant remember the merciful shall
[1:34:37] obtain mercy so if you want to receive
[1:34:40] mercy from others be merciful Amen it's
[1:34:46] pretty straightforward really you know
[1:34:48] you want people to make treat others how
[1:34:50] you want to be treated and how we treat
[1:34:53] others we want to basically we have
[1:34:56] be beaten up thrown on the gutter cast
[1:34:58] aside that's that's how sometimes we
[1:35:00] treat each other like that's the thing I
[1:35:02] tried and still am i girls do you want
[1:35:04] to be treated that way
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:08] do you want to be treated that way you
[1:35:10] know I've got to the one who did it
[1:35:11] do you wanna be treated that way no of
[1:35:14] course not what don't treat her that way
[1:35:16] Jesus is how you treat others you'll be
[1:35:18] treated the same way you followed me
[1:35:22] if it works for children works rattles
[1:35:24] to you amen that's that's good for
[1:35:27] everyone so he is he should have been
[1:35:32] his brother's keeper because of
[1:35:33] selfishness and pride he killed his
[1:35:36] brother to destroy the Holy Ghost moving
[1:35:38] amen and he said and then and then God
[1:35:41] says to him and verse 10 I think it's
[1:35:44] there he said what is thou done the
[1:35:46] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[1:35:48] me from the ground now the blood of
[1:35:50] Jesus Christ speaks better things in
[1:35:52] that of Abel because the blood of Abel
[1:35:54] all could do is cry out for you know
[1:35:57] I've been killed
[1:35:58] revenge me avenge me O Lord but the
[1:36:01] blood of Jesus Christ cries out mercy it
[1:36:03] cries out freedom and cries out
[1:36:05] Redemption how that cries out salvation
[1:36:08] hallelujah
[1:36:08] it doesn't just cry out avenge me it
[1:36:10] says no he said forgive forgive them
[1:36:12] father they don't know what they do says
[1:36:14] blood cries out freedom how it cries out
[1:36:17] Liberty hallelujah amen it's not a blood
[1:36:20] just sit sit your your the life of God
[1:36:23] is it's busy it's working hallelujah
[1:36:27] it's busy upon the earth it's looking
[1:36:30] for honest hearts to come and dwell in
[1:36:33] hallelujah
[1:36:35] that's up to you what are you gonna do
[1:36:37] with it now Jesus would say in John
[1:36:41] eight when people speak about serpent
[1:36:43] seed I like John chapter 8 he says I
[1:36:45] speak Jesus being to the Pharisees I
[1:36:47] speak that which I've seen with my
[1:36:49] father and you do that which you have
[1:36:51] seen with your father
[1:36:52] he's saying we have two different
[1:36:54] fathers I do that though job so you know
[1:36:57] my father Jesus says but you scribes and
[1:36:59] Pharisees are doing that you do that
[1:37:01] which you've seen with your father what
[1:37:03] were they doing
[1:37:04] it was Cain and Abel once again the same
[1:37:07] spirits had come down now I'm making it
[1:37:09] one big mess
[1:37:10] big jump thousands of years but the same
[1:37:12] spirit and Genesis's same spirit in the
[1:37:14] Gospels I mean that's why they did not
[1:37:16] receive him receive Christ because here
[1:37:19] he was didn't come through any of their
[1:37:20] organizations Abel didn't come to Cain's
[1:37:23] altar he came outside that that that way
[1:37:27] of thinking brought his own offering it
[1:37:30] was a revelation of God he bypassed
[1:37:32] Cain's way of doing it
[1:37:33] Cain got jealous you know here comes
[1:37:36] John the Baptist's out of the wilderness
[1:37:37] why didn't he come the way of his father
[1:37:39] being a priest because his job was too
[1:37:41] important you think naturally minded
[1:37:43] well of course Zacharias would be a
[1:37:45] priest in there of course the forerunner
[1:37:47] would come through a priest home because
[1:37:49] then he'd learn the scripture and he'd
[1:37:50] Belva you know know how to treat it
[1:37:52] you know conduct himself in church and
[1:37:54] all these different things God said no I
[1:37:55] can't have him come that way you're
[1:37:57] going into the wilderness to till your
[1:37:59] appearing of Israel why because this job
[1:38:01] was too important to be contaminated
[1:38:03] with man's ideas and it's the same thing
[1:38:05] with us God has to take our thinking I
[1:38:08] think I've seen it before I think
[1:38:10] brother Andy said it first and I just
[1:38:11] loved it yeah people say oh you're
[1:38:12] brainwashed well yes my brain needed
[1:38:14] washing it needed a good for soaking
[1:38:17] well because it was filthy and dirty and
[1:38:20] mucky with the world that needed a
[1:38:21] washing hallelujah so that's why you
[1:38:24] know we our job is too important as well
[1:38:27] what's your job we're gonna take a body
[1:38:29] change we're gonna walk from this world
[1:38:31] to the next world amen
[1:38:33] Jesus says in Matthew 24 this gospel of
[1:38:36] the kingdom shall be preached in to all
[1:38:38] nations in the end shall come who wants
[1:38:41] the end to come who wants to go home so
[1:38:44] we have a job to do we are here well you
[1:38:47] know there's a reason we are here in
[1:38:50] this great place why aren't we in the
[1:38:53] fancy suburb because the Gospels
[1:38:55] preached to the poor Jesus said that's
[1:38:57] why we're here hallelujah I love this
[1:39:01] place I actually do I like it and they
[1:39:08] answered and said unto Abraham is our
[1:39:10] Father jesus saith unto them if you were
[1:39:12] Abraham's children you do the work you
[1:39:16] would do the works of Abraham so if he
[1:39:17] really was spiritually your father you
[1:39:20] would do the works of Abraham but now
[1:39:22] you seek to kill
[1:39:23] me a man that hath told you the truth
[1:39:25] which I have heard of God this did not
[1:39:27] Abraham you do the deeds of your father
[1:39:30] they said unto him we are not born of
[1:39:32] fornication we have one father even God
[1:39:34] they knew exactly what happened in the
[1:39:36] garden you do the deeds of your father
[1:39:38] and they said then they said to him
[1:39:39] where be not so I'm just repeating this
[1:39:41] you are not born of fornication you're
[1:39:43] you have one father even God Jesus say
[1:39:45] said unto them if you if God were your
[1:39:48] father you would love me for I proceeded
[1:39:51] forth and came from God neither came I
[1:39:53] of myself but he sent me ye are of your
[1:39:57] father the devil and the lusts of your
[1:39:58] father ye will do he was a murderer from
[1:40:01] the beginning and abode not in the truth
[1:40:02] because there is no truth in him when he
[1:40:05] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:40:07] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:40:10] Cain and Abel it's all through every age
[1:40:15] no during that I'm just gonna skip into
[1:40:19] the church ages very quickly but I want
[1:40:21] you to I just you know we are called
[1:40:25] if you get start reading through the
[1:40:26] church age book I'm just making a
[1:40:27] journey through brother Graham
[1:40:29] emphasizes so strongly
[1:40:32] we have been returned to the original
[1:40:35] book of Acts Pentecost before the
[1:40:38] Ephesian age started when when the
[1:40:41] church fell we've been restored back to
[1:40:44] that now that now that that doesn't mean
[1:40:48] we just preach acts to receive the holy
[1:40:51] God no we receive it he lives and then
[1:40:54] we grow right but we have not come to a
[1:40:58] place where we just have a formal
[1:41:00] culture CH and we do not just have
[1:41:03] formal cold lives he would say in the
[1:41:06] ephesian church age now this is speaking
[1:41:08] of the of the temple that was an
[1:41:10] emphasis of Dhyana he would speak about
[1:41:12] how that that is very fitting of what
[1:41:14] they did in that temple to speak of what
[1:41:16] the Antichrist spirit was willing to do
[1:41:18] through the age but I just pick up a
[1:41:20] part of his secondarily the temple had
[1:41:23] within its confines the Virgin
[1:41:25] priestesses who performed the religious
[1:41:28] acts of the temple this showed fourth
[1:41:30] day that ceremony informing ritual and
[1:41:33] works would take place of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:35] and no law
[1:41:36] would charismatic manifestation fill the
[1:41:39] temple of God shall read that again he
[1:41:42] says this showed forth the day that
[1:41:44] ceremony inform and ritual and works
[1:41:46] would take the place of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:48] and no longer would the charismatic
[1:41:51] manifestation filled the temple of God
[1:41:53] I want the charismatic manifestation of
[1:41:55] God to filled my temple I want him to
[1:41:58] come and live through me weird living
[1:41:59] stones without dead stones where living
[1:42:01] stones brought to bring the praises of
[1:42:03] God holy you may be quiet that's fine
[1:42:06] but there should be something in you
[1:42:07] bubbling fourth parlor you may not be
[1:42:09] the most expressive person we should be
[1:42:11] a living stone to be a cosmic
[1:42:13] manifestation god you're so good Jeff
[1:42:16] cleanse me you made yourself known to me
[1:42:17] I'm alive in you I'm not dead no more
[1:42:19] being quickened Holly you've you've
[1:42:21] saved me you've loosed me from sin
[1:42:23] hallelujah and not just one time but
[1:42:26] forever and ever and ever hallelujah
[1:42:29] so a charismatic manifestation should
[1:42:32] fill the temple that's why the devil
[1:42:33] says shut up sit down don't say Amen
[1:42:35] don't raise your hands don't do nothing
[1:42:37] just sit there like a but like a dead
[1:42:39] stick you see anyone who's into anything
[1:42:42] they allowed they're excited you see you
[1:42:46] see soccer you go to South America you
[1:42:49] go to Europe do they just well Renaldo's
[1:42:53] pretty good today did you see did you
[1:42:56] see Messi do that never seen him do that
[1:42:58] before pretty good are they like that
[1:43:01] no they celebrate and they celebrate and
[1:43:04] the next day they're still celebrating
[1:43:06] you know they're still shouting and
[1:43:08] dancing and whatever more white because
[1:43:10] they're in the spirit of the game and
[1:43:12] they can sit there for hours and hours
[1:43:14] and hours and just watch a ball go
[1:43:16] nothing in soccer but you know or rugby
[1:43:18] going back and forth League whatever
[1:43:20] sport you want they can sit there watch
[1:43:22] Test match after Test match after Test
[1:43:24] match keep the score should right there
[1:43:26] with their sandwiches on the on the
[1:43:28] boundary why cuz they're in the spirit
[1:43:31] of the game and they love what they're
[1:43:34] doing because something in them is
[1:43:35] feeding on it right and the spirit in
[1:43:38] them can't get enough what about eternal
[1:43:42] things what about this God this Lord
[1:43:45] Jesus Christ you just think about it he
[1:43:47] says in John 4 the Father seek
[1:43:49] such to worship Him in spirit and truth
[1:43:51] here's the God that made everything not
[1:43:55] just the earth but everything and now it
[1:43:57] says I'm gonna seek oh my I'm gonna seek
[1:44:03] worshipers I'm gonna look for them I'm
[1:44:07] gonna start hunting over this nation in
[1:44:09] this suburb this house this place I'm
[1:44:11] gonna start hunting through ages through
[1:44:13] the Ephesian age all the way down to
[1:44:14] later I said I'm gonna seek them but God
[1:44:18] you made everything you know from from
[1:44:21] you you know from eternity to eternity
[1:44:23] you know role be this is now I'm gonna
[1:44:26] seek you because I need something to
[1:44:29] worship me
[1:44:30] that's not mechanical that's not just a
[1:44:33] form of a because they've been
[1:44:35] programmed or made he wasn't satisfied
[1:44:37] with the Angels worshiping him they
[1:44:39] would say that's incredible but he
[1:44:41] wanted something with a free moral
[1:44:42] agency that willfully gave their lives
[1:44:45] knowingly over to him and worship him
[1:44:48] out of a sincere thankful appreciative
[1:44:51] heart wholly of that out of their own
[1:44:53] choosing why you're Christian because I
[1:44:56] chose he said will you I see the hope
[1:44:59] thank you this is what I've been looking
[1:45:02] for my entire life
[1:45:03] oh my hallelujah this is this is what
[1:45:06] he's been he is seeking hell Eddie found
[1:45:10] me how to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:45:14] truth but don't leave the devil say no
[1:45:17] you've done too much wrong no you listen
[1:45:19] this and this tell them to shut up and
[1:45:21] sit down because remember the Antichrist
[1:45:23] spirit does not want God he doesn't want
[1:45:26] Holy Ghost worship to happen and because
[1:45:28] when the Lord comes down to worship then
[1:45:31] healing can happen prophecy can happen
[1:45:33] discernment can happen
[1:45:34] deliverance can happen new births can
[1:45:36] happen we can be refilled with the Holy
[1:45:38] Ghost we make change hallelujah the word
[1:45:40] can put on flesh I mean that God can
[1:45:43] mold this character into our character
[1:45:45] to make us like him oh yeah we should
[1:45:49] never put God in a box this year 2020
[1:45:52] should be God all things are possible
[1:45:55] but all things are possible to them that
[1:45:58] believe therefore there is nothing
[1:46:00] impossible with you
[1:46:02] oh that's just motivational speaking no
[1:46:05] that's a scripture that's the scripture
[1:46:08] brother I'm said if there was not a law
[1:46:10] to stop it you could create your own
[1:46:12] private world and go live on it
[1:46:15] oh my wouldn't that be cool I'm not
[1:46:18] talking about Minecraft I don't know
[1:46:20] about something that's minecraft I don't
[1:46:22] want something real
[1:46:22] you could go build your own private
[1:46:25] world and go live on it hallelujah why
[1:46:29] because the Creator is in you if the
[1:46:33] Holy Ghost is in you the same one that
[1:46:35] made Sun Moon and stars made all things
[1:46:37] now comes and dwells in you so let's not
[1:46:40] put God in a box oh we have our order
[1:46:42] and yes sure we have Church order we
[1:46:44] could have all those things but don't
[1:46:45] put God in a box if the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:47] moving and you know it's the Lord you
[1:46:49] you should have confidence I can step
[1:46:50] out on this if you can see it in his
[1:46:52] word
[1:46:52] everything in its word you saying Lord
[1:46:54] it's mine the scripture says that he
[1:46:56] will withhold nothing from them that
[1:46:58] walk uprightly he's made us walk
[1:47:01] uprightly he's made me righteous so
[1:47:05] therefore he will not withhold anything
[1:47:06] from me and if he's put the Holy Ghost
[1:47:09] in my life I will ask according to his
[1:47:11] word it will not be selfish things Lord
[1:47:13] I want a billion trillion dollars I
[1:47:16] don't think he's you know unless he gave
[1:47:19] me the character to handle that kind of
[1:47:21] thing and I would if I had the character
[1:47:23] I would use it for his glory right but
[1:47:27] he will give you he said Lord yo if you
[1:47:30] have the mind of Christ what you pray
[1:47:31] for will be according to the scripture
[1:47:34] amen hallelujah so nothing is impossible
[1:47:37] with you little old me absolutely now it
[1:47:44] says in the ephesian church age again he
[1:47:45] said Paul saw it coming but he warned
[1:47:49] him about the subtle priesthood that
[1:47:50] would come and take over with his false
[1:47:52] doctrines he knew they would they would
[1:47:55] emblem in a way of worship that excluded
[1:47:57] the people from any part in a Holy
[1:47:59] Spirit ministry he knew they would
[1:48:02] implement a way of worship that excluded
[1:48:04] the people from any part in a Holy
[1:48:06] Spirit ministry I repeated that on
[1:48:08] purpose
[1:48:08] and even right today among those who
[1:48:10] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[1:48:12] there is not too much freedom and the
[1:48:14] lighting and the best we can see is a
[1:48:17] few preachers with inspired preaching
[1:48:20] while the flock just sit there and tries
[1:48:24] to absorb it and even right today I say
[1:48:32] God when I read as I say Lord not here
[1:48:35] not here and even right today among
[1:48:41] those who claim to be free and full of
[1:48:42] the Spirit there is not too much freedom
[1:48:45] in the laity and the best we can see is
[1:48:48] a few preachers with inspired preaching
[1:48:50] while the flock just sits there and
[1:48:52] tries to absorb it this is a far cry
[1:48:56] from Paul who said that when we all come
[1:49:00] together all had the leading of the
[1:49:03] Spirit and all participated in spiritual
[1:49:07] worship we have no this is serious we
[1:49:14] have been restored to a time where as
[1:49:16] not just inspired ministers or inspired
[1:49:19] song leaders its anointed people where
[1:49:23] cuz we are all the body of Christ by one
[1:49:26] spirit we baptized into one body and the
[1:49:29] body is to operate according to the Word
[1:49:31] of God right so it should be it should
[1:49:33] be God behind the pulpit is the same God
[1:49:36] that's in the pew that's the same God
[1:49:38] that's in the deacon the same God behind
[1:49:40] the sound desk the same God behind the
[1:49:42] instruments it should be the same God
[1:49:44] operating not just are sitting here
[1:49:47] trying to grasp something but should be
[1:49:49] the same God that speaking is the same
[1:49:51] God receiving in the people I'm in the
[1:49:53] same god that's anointed to speak I mean
[1:49:56] the same God and the preacher should be
[1:49:58] the same God in the pew hallelujah
[1:50:01] that's how it should be we want to be
[1:50:06] when we come together
[1:50:07] that's why brother Brahim said when when
[1:50:09] John he says I was in the spirit on the
[1:50:12] Lord's Day revelations chapter 1 he says
[1:50:14] if you want to do anything first get in
[1:50:16] the spirit get in the spirit first
[1:50:19] then do what you gonna do don't just go
[1:50:21] through the order of it no get in the
[1:50:23] spoon get under the anointing of the
[1:50:25] Holy Ghost say God come and live in me I
[1:50:28] want to get in the spirit you want to
[1:50:29] read the word and actually catch
[1:50:31] something get in the spirit just like
[1:50:33] when you hear the message get in the
[1:50:34] spirit say Lord hallelujah well how do
[1:50:37] you do that they were gathered in the
[1:50:40] upper room all praying in is there one
[1:50:43] of them one of them that's why the devil
[1:50:47] doesn't want us to sing he doesn't want
[1:50:49] us to clap her hands he doesn't want us
[1:50:50] to be free do you know my heart's desire
[1:50:53] as we stay like a man beating a
[1:50:55] tambourine on a street corner I say Lord
[1:50:58] may we stay like that all there's no
[1:51:00] substance to it hey sure amen
[1:51:04] the disciples in the book of Acts I went
[1:51:07] from house to house they had liberty God
[1:51:09] lives wherever they were we don't want
[1:51:12] to say oh we've arrived
[1:51:13] no when when when this body changes
[1:51:17] we've arrived right but right now we're
[1:51:21] on our way and if we're on our way
[1:51:23] there's more promises to possess there's
[1:51:26] more land to take I mean there's more
[1:51:28] work to fulfill I mean so we should keep
[1:51:30] pressing the battle amen until where we
[1:51:33] have received everything that God wants
[1:51:35] to give us as now in our position police
[1:51:38] will never ever let the devil try and
[1:51:40] rob you
[1:51:41] I'm in the same Holy Ghost that was on
[1:51:43] the Lord Jesus should be upon you I am
[1:51:45] in the same worship tub yeah I'm in the
[1:51:48] apostles hat you should have it as well
[1:51:50] where God comes down you say we don't
[1:51:52] believe in gifts no more why why not
[1:51:56] it's part of the word I meant there's a
[1:52:00] gift of the sermon it's part of the word
[1:52:01] gift of knowledge part of the word
[1:52:03] thanks prophecy it's all part of the
[1:52:04] word I mean if we sing let's sing in the
[1:52:07] spirit if we pray let's pray in the
[1:52:09] spirit I'm looking with some great big
[1:52:11] rush no just open your heart say Lord

[1:53:12] the people how they should be I believe
[1:53:15] the people should be more anointed of
[1:53:16] the minister why because then it should
[1:53:19] be the only reason that the words any
