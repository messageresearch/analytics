[4:02] Praise the Lord. Good
[4:05] morning. How are you all doing?
[4:08] Good. It's good. Good to be here. Praise
[4:11] the Lord. Let's um stand. I've got a
[4:14] um scripture I want to read from uh
[4:17] Psalm
[4:18] 89:8. I'm going to go from 8 down to
[4:23] 17. It says, "Oh Lord God of hosts, who
[4:26] is a strong Lord like unto thee? Or to
[4:28] thy faithfulness round about thee? Thou
[4:31] rulest the raging of the sea. When the
[4:33] waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
[4:35] Thou has broken Rahab in pieces. As one
[4:38] that is slain, thou has scattered thine
[4:40] enemies with thy strong arm. The heavens
[4:42] are thine and the earth also is thine.
[4:44] As for the world and the fullness
[4:46] thereof, thou hast founded them. The
[4:47] north and the south, thou hast created
[4:49] them. Table and Hermmon shall rejoice in
[4:52] thy name. Thou hast the mighty arm,
[4:54] strong as thy hand and high as thy right
[4:57] hand. Justice and judgment are the
[5:00] habitation are the habitation of thy
[5:02] throne. Mercy and truth shall go before
[5:04] thy face. Blessed is the people that
[5:07] know the joyful sound. They shall walk,
[5:10] oh Lord, in the light of thy
[5:11] countenance. In thy name shall they
[5:14] rejoice all the day, and in thy
[5:16] righteousness shall they be exalted. For
[5:18] thou art the glory of their strength,
[5:20] and in thy favor our horn shall be
[5:22] exalted. Those last three verses are for
[5:25] us this morning. Blessed is the people
[5:27] that know that know the joyful sound. We
[5:30] know a joyful sound this morning.
[5:31] There's a song that says, "We have heard
[5:33] the joyful sound. Jesus saves. Jesus
[5:35] saves." There's a lot of unjoyful sounds
[5:37] in the world at the moment, but we know
[5:39] we've heard the joyful sound. So, that's
[5:41] what we're going to uh do this morning
[5:42] is is um sing some joyful sounds. Let's
[5:44] just pray. Lord, we thank you that in
[5:46] your presence there is joy, Lord, and
[5:48] there's love and there's life, Lord.
[5:50] Lord and we thank you that in the midst
[5:51] of hopelessness, no matter what our
[5:53] situation might be, no matter what state
[5:55] the world is in, no matter anything,
[5:56] Lord, we have a living hope in you, we
[5:58] have joy in you, Lord. Matter if there
[6:00] if we live in a world full of
[6:01] depression, Lord, in you, there's joy,
[6:03] there's hope, there's life. So Lord, we
[6:05] just want to sing to you this morning,
[6:07] Lord, and rejoice that you've Lord,
[6:09] you've given us the joyful sound, Lord.
[6:11] We've heard the joyful sound that comes
[6:13] from you, Lord, that says Jesus saves.
[6:15] So we just commit the service to you.
[6:16] May you bless us this morning. bless the
[6:18] songs and bless the the word. May we

[36:52] Praise God. Amen. Let's um yeah. So 2
[36:54] Kings um 6 and 8 says here, "Then the
[36:59] king of Syria wared against Israel, and
[37:01] took counsel with his servants, saying,
[37:02] "In such a such a place shall be my
[37:04] camp." And the man of God sent unto the
[37:07] king of Israel, saying, "Beware uh that
[37:09] thou pass not such a place, for hither
[37:12] uh thither, however it says, the Syrians
[37:14] are come down." And the king of Israel
[37:16] sent to the place which the man of God
[37:18] told him and warned him of and save
[37:21] saved him there not once nor twice.
[37:24] Therefore, not once nor twice.
[37:26] Therefore, the heart of the king of
[37:27] Syria was sore troubled for this thing.
[37:29] And he called his servants and said unto
[37:31] them, Will you not show me which of us
[37:33] is for the king of Israel? And one of
[37:36] his servants said,"None, my lord, oh
[37:38] king, but Elisha the prophet that is in
[37:40] Israel, tellth the king of Israel the
[37:42] words that thou speaketh in thy bed
[37:44] chamber." And he said, "Go spy where he
[37:47] is, that I may send and fetch him." And
[37:49] it was told him, saying, Behold, he is
[37:51] in Dothan. Therefore, uh, sent he
[37:54] thither horses and chariots and a great
[37:56] host, and they came by night, and he can
[37:58] pass the city about. And when the
[38:00] servant of the man of God was risen
[38:02] early and gone forth, behold, and host
[38:05] compass the city both with horses and
[38:07] chariots, and his servant said unto him,
[38:09] Alas, my master, what shall we do? And
[38:11] he answered, "Fear not, for they that be
[38:14] with us are more than they that be with
[38:16] them." And Elisha prayed and said, Lord,
[38:18] I pray thee opened his eyes that he may
[38:20] see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the
[38:22] young man and saw, and behold, the
[38:24] mountains were full of horses and
[38:25] chariots of fire round about Elisha.
[38:29] Hallelujah. Then we're just going to
[38:30] read one verse from John. You don't need
[38:31] to read it. I mean I mean turn to it.
[38:33] Sorry. Uh John 19 and5. This is where
[38:36] Pilate brings the Lord Jesus forth
[38:38] before the people. It says, "Then came
[38:40] Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns
[38:42] and purple robe and Pilate saith unto
[38:44] them, Behold the man."
[38:48] Amen. Let's bow heads in a word of
[38:50] prayer this morning. Amen. If you have a
[38:51] need, just lift it up in faith to the
[38:53] Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Gracious father,
[38:55] we're so thankful, Lord. We can say
[38:57] death has lost its grip on us. Lord,
[38:59] you're the God that can do anything.
[39:01] Lord Jesus, you there's nothing that you
[39:03] cannot do, Father. All things are
[39:04] possible, Lord, with you. And you said
[39:06] all things are possible to them that
[39:07] believe. So I pray, Father, you'd raise
[39:09] our faith this day, dear God. May I pray
[39:11] a rapturing faith would strike every
[39:13] heart. May your spirit of revelation
[39:14] touch every life. Father, may the gloom
[39:17] and discouragement of this world be
[39:18] gone. Lord, I pray that Lord, that you'd
[39:20] be exalted in our midst, Lord. Go from
[39:22] heart to heart, Lord. Touch every life,
[39:24] Lord Jesus. break every chain and curse
[39:26] and feder of the enemy, Lord. Every
[39:28] sickness, may it be gone, Father. Every
[39:30] doubt and frustration, Lord, may it be
[39:31] gone as we sit at your table, Lord, in
[39:33] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[39:36] bless you, friends. You can have your
[39:38] seats um this morning. So, I want to
[39:40] speak about looking at the Lord. I put
[39:43] um I put the uh um I put the quote by,
[39:46] you know, from um from I say, Brother
[39:48] Martin Luther um on, you know, my status
[39:50] during the week. I've been chewing on
[39:52] this for a while. I'm not sure where I
[39:54] heard it from, but Martin Luther said,
[39:55] "When I look at myself, I can't see how
[39:58] I can be saved. But when I look at
[40:00] Christ, I don't see how I can be lost."
[40:02] Amen. So, it depends who you're looking
[40:04] at this morning. Even your whole life,
[40:06] if you look at yourself, you say, "How
[40:07] on earth can I ever make it?" But if you
[40:09] look at him, you say, "How on earth can
[40:11] I not make it?" Amen. So, it depends who
[40:13] you're looking at. Now, you know, what
[40:15] you look at affects your attitude. It's
[40:17] it it affects the atmosphere you carry.
[40:20] Amen. It affects how you treat others.
[40:22] It's what you look at affects what you
[40:24] say. Now, you got to look at when people
[40:27] uh are are down in the dumps is because
[40:29] they're looking at stuff that make it
[40:30] down in the dumps. If you look at world
[40:32] news, it cannot make anyone happy,
[40:34] right? If you feed off the things of the
[40:35] world, you'll never get any joy from
[40:37] those things. Amen. But if you look at
[40:39] the Lord, Amen, how can you be unhappy?
[40:41] How can you be down? Amen. Why? Because
[40:43] the joy of the Lord is our strength and
[40:45] his word is a fullness of joy. Amen.
[40:47] He's put it into your heart. Amen. This
[40:49] morning, amen. God is here to lift you
[40:52] up into heavenly places. Amen. So let's
[40:54] not look at ourselves or this world.
[40:56] Let's look to him. Amen. Because if you
[40:58] look at him, nothing is impossible.
[41:00] Amen. You know, you if you look at him,
[41:02] just just one moment looking at his word
[41:04] as he opens his word to you, you think,
[41:06] how on earth could anyone be lost? How
[41:08] on earth can my family ever be in lost?
[41:10] How could I ever be stuck here? How
[41:11] could I ever not miss the you never
[41:13] never take the rapture? No. If you look
[41:15] at him, you're fully persuaded God can
[41:17] do it. Hallelujah.
[41:21] Amen. You know, I realized um uh you
[41:24] after coming back from Canada, I
[41:25] realized, you know, I've been negative.
[41:27] I've been too negative for a while. I've
[41:29] been negative. I thought, Lord, take
[41:30] this negativity out of me. Take the
[41:32] spirit of negativity out of me. So, I
[41:34] pray we're going to be positive from now
[41:36] on. Amen. Cuz we got a positive word, a
[41:38] positive message. Amen. It's not a
[41:40] message of condemnation. It's a message
[41:42] of deliverance, of salvation, of peace.
[41:45] Amen. Of joy unspeakable. Amen. So, this
[41:48] is just how I want to be from now on.
[41:49] You know, that spirit tried to come
[41:50] back. I said, "No, I see you. Get out of
[41:52] here in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen.
[41:54] So, if you ever feel negative or down,
[41:55] that's not God. That's not you. That's
[41:57] your enemy. Amen. We should be positive
[41:59] beyond positive. Can you be too positive
[42:01] in the Lord? I don't know. Let's find
[42:04] out. I don't think so. Amen. So, see the
[42:07] king of Syria now. So, now we find in
[42:09] our scene here, Elisha and Gahazi, who
[42:12] was his servant, found themselves in
[42:13] Dothan, surrounded by the enemy. Now the
[42:15] king of Syria sent his army there
[42:17] because he was told that Elijah knew his
[42:19] thoughts even in his bed chamber. Kind
[42:22] of reminds me about the fact that we
[42:23] know the devil's schemes. Amen. As
[42:25] brother Bram would say in the second
[42:26] seal they says the opening of the seals
[42:28] it doesn't just reveal Christ but it
[42:30] reveals the devil and his schemes and
[42:32] who he is. It unfolds the enemy. Amen.
[42:35] So just like Elisha I say the seals were
[42:37] open to him. Amen. He understood the
[42:38] workings of the enemy, working out how
[42:40] he moves and where where he's going to
[42:42] ambush and how he can trip him up and,
[42:43] you know, cause devastation to Israel.
[42:45] But it was all revealed to Elisha
[42:47] because the word came open to him. I
[42:49] mean, he wasn't ignorant of the devil's
[42:51] devices and he told the king of Israel
[42:53] what he would be doing. I mean, so the
[42:55] uh uh the devil or I mean the king of
[42:57] Syria, you know, sent his imps or his
[42:59] army, I mean, to go find Elisha and
[43:01] Gazi. Now, let's just stop for a moment.
[43:03] Don't you think that God could have
[43:04] shown Elisha that the enemy was there?
[43:07] He didn't seem too surprised, right? And
[43:10] we shouldn't be surprised when the enemy
[43:11] tries to take us out or surround us, but
[43:14] it all depends what you're looking at uh
[43:16] in the situation. Now, I believe the
[43:19] reason that God allowed this to happen
[43:20] is because God wanted to open Gahazi's
[43:22] eyes to the fact that they're not alone.
[43:24] I mean, that the you know that the
[43:26] armies of heaven that were around Elisha
[43:28] were there the whole time. Gahazi never
[43:30] seen the chariots of fire before. Elisha
[43:33] did. Amen. When he followed Elijah over
[43:35] the Jordan River, you know, we know that
[43:37] that chariot of fire picked up Elijah
[43:39] took him up in a rapture. And brother
[43:41] Bram said that when they crossed Jordan,
[43:43] that every bush and every tree had a
[43:45] chariot of fire hitched to it. Amen. So,
[43:47] so when they crossed that Jordan, Elisha
[43:49] could see into the unseen realm, he had
[43:51] seen miracles before, but now he saw
[43:53] heaven come open. Amen. So, he realized
[43:55] that those same chariots that lifted up
[43:57] Elijah into heaven were with him even
[43:59] now. Amen. So, so, but Gahazi didn't
[44:02] know this. So, I believe that God
[44:04] allowed the trouble to strike Gahazi
[44:07] because God wanted Gahazi to know you're
[44:09] not alone in this walk. You've been
[44:11] following the bride of Christ for a long
[44:13] time. You're one of the believers. But I
[44:14] want you to know, Amen. There's more
[44:16] than just you. What are you looking at,
[44:17] Gahazi? Don't look at this thing. Look
[44:19] at heaven. Amen. That's why Elijah
[44:21] prayed, "Lord, open his eyes." Because
[44:23] because Elijah knew those armies that
[44:26] see his prayer didn't bring the armies
[44:28] of heaven down. No, they were there the
[44:30] whole time. Amen. But it opened up
[44:32] Gahazi's eyes to the reality of what was
[44:34] with him. I mean, it was more than the
[44:35] Syrians. It was the armies of heaven or
[44:37] around him. Amen. And God will use
[44:40] trouble to open the eyes of his people.
[44:43] Amen. God will have a testimony, right?
[44:45] Amen. God will have a testimony in every
[44:47] situation. And what is the really the
[44:49] outcome of every testimony? God lives.
[44:51] God wants to prove his word. Amen. God
[44:53] will send you trouble to get a hold of
[44:55] your family. Amen. God will send you a
[44:57] trial. God will send you a problem.
[44:59] Amen. that God can step into and those
[45:01] who are around you can look and say,
[45:02] "Yes, this message is true." Amen. This
[45:04] word lives. Amen. God is the same
[45:06] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[45:08] why trouble comes. Amen. Brother says
[45:11] that God harnesses trouble, puts bits in
[45:14] its mouth, and makes it obey him. Amen.
[45:16] Those troubles bring us into a closer
[45:18] fellowship with God. Amen. So you say,
[45:20] "Well, I've got a lot of trouble." I
[45:21] say, God actually wants you very close.
[45:23] Amen. He's not sending you trouble to
[45:25] drive you away. sending you trouble to
[45:27] pull him, pull you closer to his bosom.
[45:29] Hallelujah. Say, Lord, praise God for
[45:31] trouble cuz you want a closer walk with
[45:33] me.
[45:35] Hallelujah. And Gahazi, God wanted that
[45:37] walk with
[45:38] Gahazi. Amen. So there, so so there at
[45:41] first, Gahazi is looking at the Syrian
[45:43] army. He's stressed. He's anxious. He's
[45:46] talking about, "Wo is us. We're trapped.
[45:48] The game is up. There's no escape." Now,
[45:50] see, he's looking at the wrong thing. By
[45:54] looking at the Syrians, he realized
[45:55] there's no way we can escape.
[45:57] It's inevitable. It's just going to go
[46:00] through the motions. The Syrians are
[46:01] going to maybe starve us out. We're
[46:03] going to die. Maybe they'll assault the
[46:04] city. Take it. We're going to die. The
[46:06] sum of his thought process was they were
[46:09] going to die. It was just a matter of
[46:11] time. That's cuz he was looking at the
[46:13] wrong thing. Amen. He's looking at the
[46:15] wrong thing. Never look at the natural
[46:17] things around you. No. Because those
[46:19] same angels that were with Elisha are
[46:21] with the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[46:23] And as the word would say in Psalms
[46:25] 34:7, the angel of the Lord encamps
[46:27] about those that fear him and deliverth
[46:30] them. Hallelujah. Amen. So, and and the
[46:33] next verse says, "Oh, taste and see that
[46:35] the Lord is good. Blessed is the man
[46:37] that trusteth in him." Amen. So, the
[46:40] angel of the Lord encamps about you.
[46:42] Amen. He's around you wherever you go.
[46:43] He's not just up in glory. He's with
[46:45] you. He's on your level. Amen. If you're
[46:47] on a mountain, he's with you next to
[46:49] you. If you're in a valley, he's with
[46:50] you. Doesn't matter where you are, he's
[46:52] with you. the entire time. And he
[46:54] encamps about you not to just be a
[46:56] silent onlooker, but to bring
[46:58] deliverance. Amen. To bring a way out.
[47:00] Amen. To to to to bring you out of
[47:03] trouble. Amen. Praise the Lord. See, so
[47:06] Elisha wasn't looking at the Syrians. He
[47:09] said, "There's more for us than against
[47:10] us." Amen. And then Gahazi got the same
[47:13] revelation. And he was more And then
[47:15] when he saw the armies of heaven, well,
[47:17] before they saw it's impossible for us
[47:19] to get out of this situation, he saw the
[47:21] armies of heaven. and he say it's
[47:22] impossible for us not to get out cuz
[47:24] God's in control. Hallelujah. Same thing
[47:27] with us friends. We're not alone. We're
[47:29] not alone in this walk. We are not we're
[47:32] we are not defeated. We're victorious in
[47:35] every situation. God will have a
[47:37] testimony in every day of your life.
[47:38] He'll have a testimony. He wants to
[47:40] prove his word more than you realize.
[47:42] Amen. We cry out, "God, bring a miracle.
[47:44] Bring deliverance. Bring the
[47:45] supernatural." He wants to give it more
[47:47] than you want to receive it. Hallelujah.
[47:50] Well, then why why is he sometimes
[47:52] silent? Because he wants you to be
[47:54] certain of him in silence. When I don't
[47:56] feel him, he's working. When I don't see
[47:58] him, he's working. You got to be certain
[48:00] of God. Amen. Elisha was certain of God
[48:03] cuz he had a supernatural transformation
[48:05] when he received the uh mantle of
[48:07] Elijah. Amen. But he was certain of God.
[48:09] He didn't, you know, we got to be
[48:11] certain of God in the silence. It's not
[48:13] always in the rejoicing and the happy
[48:15] time. No, be certain of God in the
[48:17] silence. Job was certain of God when he
[48:19] didn't have an answer. He had lost his
[48:21] family except for his wife. Lost all of
[48:23] his, you know, uh, livestock and all
[48:25] these things sitting there with boils
[48:27] busted out in his body. His friends came
[48:29] and accused him that he was a secret
[48:31] sinner. But he was certain of God. Amen.
[48:34] Cuz he was certain he had met Jehovah's
[48:36] requirements of the blood of the lamb.
[48:38] Amen. And brother Ram says, "When you
[48:40] turn over every stone of your life and
[48:42] there's nothing, just be certain of
[48:44] God." Amen. Be certain that you've met
[48:46] every requirement. You say, "What are
[48:48] the requirements?" Repent. Give your
[48:50] heart to the Lord Jesus Christ. Be
[48:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:54] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[48:56] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[48:57] Ghost. That's you. That's Brother Bam
[48:59] said that's you meeting God's
[49:00] requirements. And if you're sick, call
[49:02] the elders of the church, be anointed
[49:03] with oil, be and then be certain of God.
[49:05] God will answer his word in his time.
[49:09] I mean, I believe if there's a people
[49:10] that are certain of God, I'm looking at
[49:12] them this morning. I mean, we've seen
[49:13] him do too much not to be certain of
[49:15] him, to start doubting him now. No, he's
[49:17] done too much for us to doubt him now.
[49:19] Even if we feel trouble and hardship and
[49:20] we don't know which way to go, we are
[49:22] certain he will lead us. We are certain
[49:24] he will speak in his season. We are
[49:26] certain that we can stand on the rock of
[49:28] revelation no matter what what we face.
[49:31] Amen. God wants to prove your faith
[49:33] works. Amen. God wants to prove this
[49:35] rock of revelation you're built upon is
[49:38] not shifting sands. It's not a man-made
[49:40] construction that can decay and fall
[49:41] apart, but it's an unmovable rock. Amen.
[49:44] It doesn't matter what the devil pushes
[49:46] against you of doubt, trouble, splits in
[49:48] families, hardship, whatever it is, God
[49:50] wants you to know, I built you on the
[49:52] rock. Amen. That rock will not fail. You
[49:55] will not fall. You might feel like
[49:56] you're going to slide off the thing, but
[49:58] God says, "I've got you on this rock."
[50:00] Amen. You see, every material is always
[50:02] tested. I remember when I was uh very
[50:05] long time ago now was an American sire.
[50:07] I was on a building site. I was in the
[50:10] office. Don't know how I got the job,
[50:11] but I was there. Every time they poured
[50:13] concrete, they take two cylinders of
[50:15] concrete or make two cylinders and they
[50:17] would pressure test them at certain days
[50:19] to prove that the concrete they poured
[50:21] was was fine. So they put it in this
[50:23] pressure test and you know it would
[50:26] break over a certain pressure was okay.
[50:28] I tell you what, God. But so the
[50:30] concrete had to be proved. Right? Your
[50:33] faith must be proved and and God will
[50:36] allow the devil to put a pressure test.
[50:38] And it may seem very very great, but
[50:40] actually the material is indestructible.
[50:43] Revelation is indestructible. Amen. That
[50:45] you're built in. Amen. That is it. It
[50:47] doesn't matter what pressure can come,
[50:48] that thing can't bust.
[50:51] Hallelujah. Well, are you sure? Are you
[50:53] still a believer? Are you still a
[50:56] believer? We're going through many, many
[50:58] pressure tests, many, many things we've
[51:00] gone through. We're still here.
[51:05] Why? God wants you to know your faith
[51:07] holds. When you think you can't hold, it
[51:10] holds you. Amen. Like brother Brand, you
[51:12] know, he has asked when he lost his wife
[51:14] and his daughter, you know, uh he was
[51:16] asked, you know, are you still holding
[51:17] on to your religion? And he said, "No,
[51:20] no, my God's holding me.
[51:22] My God's holding me."
[51:27] Hallelujah. Amen. The Apostle Paul would
[51:30] speak of, you know, we just read this in
[51:33] sec um 2 Corinthians 4. He says, "We're
[51:37] troubled on every side yet not
[51:39] distressed." The Apostle Paul is looking
[51:40] at something, right? We are prop
[51:43] perplexed but not in despair, persecuted
[51:46] but not forsaken, cast down but not
[51:47] destroyed, always bearing about in the
[51:49] body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[51:51] the life also of Jesus might be made
[51:53] manifest in our body. We which live are
[51:55] always delivered unto death for Jesus'
[51:57] sake, that the life also of Jesus might
[51:59] be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So
[52:02] then death workketh in us, but life in
[52:04] you, pardon me. We having the same
[52:06] spirit of faith according as it is
[52:07] written, I believed, and therefore have
[52:10] I spoken. We also believe and therefore
[52:12] speak, knowing that he which raised up
[52:14] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[52:18] Jesus and shall present us with you. For
[52:20] all things are for your sakes, that the
[52:22] abundant grace might through the
[52:24] thanksgiving of many rebound to the
[52:25] glory of God. For which cause we faint
[52:27] not. For though the our outward man
[52:30] perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[52:32] day by day. For our light affliction is
[52:34] but for a moment. See, he wasn't looking
[52:36] at his afflictions. Remember, he had
[52:37] been shipwrecked. He had been stoned. He
[52:39] had been put in jail. He had been, you
[52:42] know, battles of religious spirits, all
[52:44] kind of things. But he wasn't looking at
[52:46] those things. Amen. He really he was
[52:48] looking to the Lord.
[52:50] Amen. So, and he said, "Those things are
[52:52] all just but light afflictions at which
[52:54] our for just above um just for a moment
[52:56] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[52:58] eternal weight of glory. Why we look not
[53:00] at the things which are seen, but at the
[53:03] things which are not seen, for the
[53:04] things that are seen are temporal, but
[53:06] the things which are not seen are
[53:08] eternal." Amen. That's why you know
[53:10] Elisha, you know, he he wanted Gahazi to
[53:13] look at the unseen realm. Look at that
[53:15] realm that was already around him. Amen.
[53:17] Amen. And that's why the apostle Paul
[53:19] would come down, you know, after he
[53:20] would after he'd go through the heroes
[53:22] of faith in uh Hebrews chapter 11, he
[53:25] said, you know, then he would say,
[53:26] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[53:28] finisher of our faith. Amen. Who is who
[53:31] for the joy set before him endured the
[53:33] cross, despising the shame, and is set
[53:35] down at the right hand of the throne of
[53:37] God. Amen. See, see, it all depends what
[53:40] you're looking at. Amen. Are you looking
[53:43] at yourself or you looking at the word?
[53:45] Amen. And if you look at the word then
[53:48] the there's no way you can be lost. If
[53:51] you look at yourself you you know that's
[53:53] when you get into jeopardy. Remember the
[53:54] devil doesn't want you to look at him at
[53:57] the word. He wants you to look at
[53:59] yourself and your own ability. See this
[54:01] has always been the problem down through
[54:03] the ages is a legalistic spirit has
[54:05] always been there. People have always
[54:06] thought if I do a certain thing
[54:08] therefore I'm saved. Right? You know
[54:10] brother Ram said the Pentecostals were
[54:12] great legalists. What did they do? as
[54:14] they believed that they did something.
[54:16] What was that? Spoken tongues. They were
[54:17] sealed to the day of their redemption.
[54:19] But grace goes beyond all those things.
[54:21] But what happens when it comes to the
[54:22] message realm? Well, if I understand the
[54:24] seals, therefore, I'm redeemed. But it's
[54:27] not a mental understanding. You just
[54:28] walk with God. God unfolds his word. No,
[54:30] we're saved by the grace of God. And
[54:33] it's not our doing. It's his doing. We
[54:35] just let him do it.
[54:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, you
[54:41] know, we got to make sure that we're
[54:42] looking at him and his word, not at what
[54:45] people have done with the word. You
[54:48] know, you say, "Well, brother, brother
[54:49] so and so took this quote, this
[54:50] scripture and said this, or sister so
[54:52] and so had this attitude cuz she had
[54:54] this quote and all these things." You
[54:55] are you're looking at the wrong thing.
[54:58] Amen. We're all still human, right? We
[55:00] all are a work in progress. Amen. We all
[55:03] want a closer walk with God. Hallelujah.
[55:06] We're all, you know, we're all being
[55:07] refined and molded. You know, none of us
[55:10] are perfect
[55:11] Christians. Amen. But you see those
[55:13] things, if you look at the wrong things,
[55:15] it will build a complex in your life.
[55:17] Amen. But the blood of Jesus Christ has
[55:19] never given anyone a complex. Amen. If
[55:21] you look at him, that's why I read Pilot
[55:23] saying, "Behold the man." Amen. The
[55:26] greatest one that would ever stand in
[55:27] flesh was right there in front of them.
[55:29] They weren't looking at him, right?
[55:31] Pilate even wasn't looking at him,
[55:32] right? But there were some believers
[55:34] there that saw him. This is the Messiah.
[55:36] This is the Christ. He's come to take
[55:38] away the sins of the world. If you
[55:40] behold him, everything will work out
[55:42] fine.
[55:43] Amen. Because if you behold him and how
[55:45] great he is, then you are actually
[55:46] allowing his word, his power to manifest
[55:49] through
[55:49] you. Amen. You don't get a complex by
[55:52] the blood of Jesus Christ. You get love.
[55:54] That's where you get love, not a
[55:56] complex. So, brother Bram says, "Amen."
[55:59] Praise the Lord. Now it says in Isaiah
[56:01] 59:19, he says, "So, so shall they fear
[56:04] the name of the Lord from the west and
[56:06] his glory from the rising of the sun."
[56:08] We have had the rising of the sun in
[56:10] this day. When brother Ram stood there
[56:11] on Easter Sunday, I believe it was, and
[56:13] preached this, it is the rising of the
[56:15] sun. He wasn't just picking a nice
[56:17] title. He was making a declaration.
[56:19] There's been a dual sun rising. Not just
[56:21] a natural sun, but the sen, the son of
[56:24] God has risen in these last days. Amen.
[56:26] to transform a people to make them into
[56:29] his image. Amen. That we can look upon
[56:31] him. Amen. We can look upon him and
[56:34] realize our God is alive. He's the same
[56:36] yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[56:38] present in this age. He's just alive in
[56:40] 2025 as he was back 20,000 years ago,
[56:43] back in 1963. He's the same God today.
[56:47] I'm persuaded about that. I don't think
[56:49] we can lift that up enough. I don't
[56:51] think we can emphasize it enough that
[56:52] he's the same God. Amen. Why do we allow
[56:55] trouble and fear to grip our lives
[56:56] because we're not looking at him? Don't
[56:59] give don't give fear power in your life.
[57:01] No, fear should be powerless in your
[57:03] life. And the enemy will try and put
[57:05] fear upon your uncertainty. But how does
[57:06] he do it? Makes you look at you and your
[57:09] personality and your struggles and your
[57:12] things. I say those things are all lying
[57:14] vanities.
[57:15] Look on the Lord and he will fix you. We
[57:19] are his workmanship.
[57:21] Glory. I'm not my own workmanship. Not
[57:23] I'm not trying to reform myself. Not
[57:25] trying to turn over a new leaf. How How
[57:27] has that worked for anyone?
[57:30] No good. New Year's resolution. January
[57:32] 2nd, they're all turned back again. You
[57:35] know, oh, but I've got a strong
[57:36] willpower. It will come to an end. Amen.
[57:39] Peter had a strong willpower when he
[57:41] said, "Lord, I'll never forsake you.
[57:42] I'll never deny you. I'll never be
[57:44] offended there." But he was offended. He
[57:47] denied the Lord. He swore and cursed
[57:48] doing it all these things there before
[57:50] the crucifixion. But he he he thought my
[57:53] willpower I can be a real Christian.
[57:55] Ain't it ain't willpower, it's a give
[57:57] up. It's a surrender. Oh, that's
[58:00] weakness. No, that's strength. Because
[58:01] when you give up, then he can take over.
[58:04] Amen. The the unconquerable. Amen. All
[58:06] conquering, all powerful Lord God
[58:08] Almighty can step into your human
[58:10] battles and take over. Amen. Amen. When
[58:13] the enemy shall come in like a flood,
[58:15] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[58:16] standard against him. Amen. Now, many
[58:19] people look at the flood and they forget
[58:21] the standard, right? We know there's a
[58:23] flood in this day. The enemy has come in
[58:25] like a flood. That's not coming in the
[58:27] future. He's already here. There's been,
[58:29] you know, the lid of hell has been
[58:31] lifted off. Demon power is streaming
[58:33] everywhere. Amen. Spirits of unbelief
[58:36] have heaped up. Gross darkness has
[58:38] covered the people. But if you read that
[58:39] in Isaiah, it says, "Behold, arise and
[58:42] shine, for thy light has come." He says,
[58:44] "Thy light has come." And then he says,
[58:46] "Gross darkness covers the people." So
[58:48] it depends what you're looking at. I
[58:50] mean, if you look at the gross darkness,
[58:51] you think, "How on earth can I ever get
[58:52] out of here?" I mean, the millions of
[58:54] voices and opinions that have flooded
[58:56] this world. How can I ever find truth?
[58:58] Well, you can. Jesus said, "You shall
[59:00] know the truth, and the truth shall make
[59:02] you free." Amen. The mechanics of the
[59:04] beast system are set up ready for the
[59:06] devil to become incarnate in a man. It's
[59:08] all here. But we know when the devil is
[59:11] when the devil is cast out and incarnate
[59:13] in a man, the brideges up. Amen. Amen.
[59:16] So, but we may look at these things,
[59:17] look at all the unbelief, the
[59:18] skepticism, all the, you know, science
[59:21] and all these things that have flooded
[59:22] this planet, you know, reasoning and all
[59:24] these things, philosophy and things. We
[59:26] think if you look at that flood, you
[59:28] think, how on earth are we ever get out
[59:30] going to get out of here, but you're
[59:31] looking at the wrong thing. You see,
[59:33] what you look at will affect your mood,
[59:35] will affect what you say, will affect
[59:38] your actions. Amen. It's like you look
[59:39] at your children. If you look at the
[59:41] flood, you think, "How on earth are my
[59:42] children ever going to get out of here?
[59:44] How are we ever going to get out of
[59:45] here?" And then what happens? You become
[59:47] a helicopter parent. You get all tense.
[59:49] You get all stressed. You're just trying
[59:50] to beat them down and keep them
[59:52] contained. Be trying to be negative and
[59:53] all these things. That is not faith.
[59:56] That is fear. But we're not here to have
[59:59] fear. We're here to have faith. Amen.
[1:00:01] Because if you look at the flood, that's
[1:00:03] how you begin to speak. You speak
[1:00:04] negative and worried and troubled and
[1:00:06] all these things. But turn your eyes up.
[1:00:09] Turn your eyes up to the standard that
[1:00:11] has been raised in this age. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:13] The manifested word is here. Christ
[1:00:16] himself. Amen. Is present. It's the
[1:00:18] greatest standard that's ever come.
[1:00:20] Amen. Behold the man.
[1:00:23] Amen. Behold this great one. Amen. That
[1:00:26] holds holds back the hordes of hell
[1:00:28] until his bride gets
[1:00:30] home. Amen. So don't forget the
[1:00:33] standard.
[1:00:34] No. Look at the standard. If you look at
[1:00:37] the flood, you think, "How on earth how
[1:00:39] on earth am I going to get out here?" If
[1:00:41] you look at him, you think, "How on
[1:00:42] earth am I going to stay?"
[1:00:45] You think about how great he is. He
[1:00:47] hasn't called you to lose you. I mean,
[1:00:49] he hasn't called you to take you halfway
[1:00:51] or 3/4 of the way and leave you in a
[1:00:54] desert. No, he's come to place you in
[1:00:55] his promises. Place you in the baptism
[1:00:58] of the Holy Ghost. I mean, every divine
[1:01:00] promise belongs over Jordan. And he's
[1:01:02] opened the Jordan, tooken us through,
[1:01:05] placed us placed us in in our
[1:01:07] inheritance. Amen. If you look at him,
[1:01:09] you think, "How on earth could I ever be
[1:01:11] lost?" Amen. You look at him, you think,
[1:01:13] "How on earth can my family be lost?"
[1:01:17] They can't. Amen. How on earth can that
[1:01:20] spirit of unbelief grip them and keep
[1:01:22] them keep them captive? It cannot. Amen.
[1:01:25] Amen. He loosed you of unbelief. He
[1:01:28] loosed you of skepticism. He loosed you
[1:01:30] of religion. Amen. He leaves loose you
[1:01:32] of evolution. All these kind of
[1:01:33] nonsense. God loosed you. Amen. So the
[1:01:36] same faith that God gave you to that you
[1:01:38] would be free. Apply it to your family.
[1:01:40] Amen. Don't fear about what the enemy
[1:01:42] can do. No. My God is greater. My God is
[1:01:45] stronger. My God is more powerful. Amen.
[1:01:48] So have faith. That same faith.
[1:01:49] Hallelujah. That you had for yourself.
[1:01:51] Amen. Apply it to your family. Lift up
[1:01:54] that standard and say, "Lord, how on
[1:01:56] earth can my family be lost?"
[1:01:59] Hallelujah. How can we be in jeopardy
[1:02:00] for a moment? You say, "Well, they've
[1:02:02] gone real wayward." You're looking at
[1:02:04] the wrong thing. You're looking at the
[1:02:06] wrong thing. Amen. The prodal son went
[1:02:08] wayward. He planned it. He went out
[1:02:10] there. A spirit got on him and he
[1:02:12] thought the world had something more
[1:02:13] than he ever had. Amen. At home in his
[1:02:15] father's house. But what did his father
[1:02:18] look at? Was he upset? Was he hurt?
[1:02:20] Sure, he's human. He loved his loved his
[1:02:23] son. But what was he looking at? He
[1:02:25] wasn't looking at the direction his son
[1:02:26] went in. I mean, he's looking at the
[1:02:28] covenant promise God gave him. Amen. The
[1:02:31] revelation that he was a son of Abraham.
[1:02:34] Amen. He looked at that. He thought,
[1:02:35] "How on earth can my son stay away?"
[1:02:39] Hallelujah. What' that do? It causes
[1:02:41] angel of the Lord to go into a pig pen.
[1:02:43] Amen. Cause the angel of the Lord to
[1:02:45] break a cycle in a life. Amen. People
[1:02:47] try and turn a new leaf. I'm going to do
[1:02:48] better. I'm going to serve God. They
[1:02:50] fall and fall and fall. But God wants to
[1:02:52] break that cycle. Amen. God wants to
[1:02:54] break that cycle. Amen. I do. The angel
[1:02:56] of the Lord went down into the pig pen
[1:02:58] and he came to himself. What did that?
[1:03:00] The father looking at the promise.
[1:03:03] Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] Amen. The father look at the promise. I
[1:03:07] say we got moms and dads, brothers and
[1:03:08] sisters here that God has shown them the
[1:03:11] promise. Hallelujah. Why? Cuz God has
[1:03:15] transformed your life. He's shown you
[1:03:16] this message. Amen. He's shown you that
[1:03:18] the angels of heaven are around you and
[1:03:20] he's shown you that he's with you. He's
[1:03:22] already proved it. Glory.
[1:03:25] How can we be negative?
[1:03:28] If heaven fights for me,
[1:03:31] hell better watch out. Amen. If God
[1:03:34] before us, who can be against us?
[1:03:36] Nothing. No weapon formed against you
[1:03:38] shall prosper. There'll be a lot of
[1:03:40] weapons formed. They won't prosper
[1:03:41] against you. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Amen. Praise God for the weapons. Why?
[1:03:49] It draws me a closer walk with God.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:55] Hallelujah. Amen. What is the standard?
[1:03:58] It's the anointed word living in a
[1:03:59] people. It's this message putting on
[1:04:01] flesh. Amen. God has made you thus
[1:04:05] already. You have the baptism of the
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost. You're the living word in
[1:04:08] flesh today. Amen. You're the Bible in
[1:04:12] flesh form, reality form. That's what
[1:04:15] you are. Amen. You're the seventh seal
[1:04:18] walking around upon the earth. What is
[1:04:19] the seventh seal? Christ himself coming
[1:04:21] down to redeem his earth, redeemer his
[1:04:24] bride. Amen. You You're already part of
[1:04:26] that process. Hallelujah. You want to
[1:04:29] see the seventh seal? Here I am. Don't
[1:04:32] cut that out and make something out of
[1:04:33] it, but you know what I mean.
[1:04:36] Christ is in his body. If Christ is in
[1:04:39] me, the hope of glory, how can I be
[1:04:41] lost? How can my family be lost? How can
[1:04:44] things be? You know, we're not here just
[1:04:46] to We're here to overcome. We're here to
[1:04:49] overcome. Amen. And brother Ram said
[1:04:51] that to in order to overcome you got to
[1:04:53] recognize the enemy. Right now he talks
[1:04:56] about cancer but to me it applies to
[1:04:57] everything. Depression, negativity,
[1:05:01] anxiety, fear, whatever sickness,
[1:05:03] doubts, frustrations, trouble. If you
[1:05:06] got to recognize, yes, that's a real
[1:05:07] enemy. And yes, it's come against you.
[1:05:09] But you're going to realize the one in
[1:05:11] you already has already overcome that
[1:05:13] thing. He says that's perfectly
[1:05:15] sensible. That's overcoming. You say,
[1:05:18] "The enemy's on my case, but God's on
[1:05:19] his case." Amen. The enemy is trying to
[1:05:21] destroy me, but no, my God is greater
[1:05:24] than him. Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] Amen. Brother Ram would say in the in
[1:05:30] the uh Pergamin church age, I believe it
[1:05:32] is, he says, "Now Jesus Jesus knew that
[1:05:35] there would be a terrible drift away
[1:05:36] from the word in the Pergamian age,
[1:05:39] which was as yet 200 years off from the
[1:05:41] Patmos vision. He knew that drift would
[1:05:43] cause him to go into the dark ages. He
[1:05:45] knew that the way man originally got
[1:05:47] away from God was by first leaving the
[1:05:48] word. If you leave that word, you've
[1:05:50] left God. Thus, he is presenting himself
[1:05:52] to the church at Pergamos and indeed to
[1:05:55] all churches of all ages. I am the word.
[1:05:58] He says, if you want deity in your
[1:06:00] midst, then welcome and receive the
[1:06:03] word. Amen. Don't put your feelings
[1:06:06] above the word. Don't put what you're
[1:06:08] going through above the word. What are
[1:06:10] you looking at? I say, behold the man.
[1:06:12] And the answer to all your problems is
[1:06:13] Christ Jesus the word. Amen. Every
[1:06:16] situation you can't get yourself out of,
[1:06:18] he is the answer. Amen. So what do you
[1:06:20] look at your feelings? Well, you I'm
[1:06:22] hurt. You know, this is going on. You
[1:06:23] look at the wrong thing. If you look at
[1:06:25] your hurt, you'll just stay being hurt.
[1:06:27] But if you look to him, you'll be
[1:06:28] delivered.
[1:06:31] Amen. Don't don't ever let anyone or
[1:06:34] anything get between you and that word.
[1:06:36] That this which I'm giving you, the word
[1:06:38] is a revelation of myself. I am the
[1:06:40] word. Remember that. I and he I'm sorry.
[1:06:43] Remember that. I wonder he asked the
[1:06:46] question if we are sufficiently
[1:06:47] impressed with the word in our
[1:06:50] midst. And I had to ask myself this
[1:06:53] question during the week. Am I
[1:06:54] sufficiently
[1:06:56] impressed by the very God of heaven? The
[1:06:59] very God of the word, the very God who
[1:07:02] gave the promises, gave every prophecy,
[1:07:04] the one who spoke this whole world,
[1:07:06] everything into existence, the same one
[1:07:08] that died on Calvary, the same one that
[1:07:10] redeemed me. Am I sufficiently impressed
[1:07:13] with him in our
[1:07:15] midst? Am I impressed with him? You
[1:07:17] know, am I sufficiently captivated by
[1:07:20] the standard that he's raised in our
[1:07:21] lives? Am I impressed by it sufficiently
[1:07:24] or has it become
[1:07:26] common? You know, Brother Bram tells a
[1:07:29] story of a poet. He had he had spent his
[1:07:31] life writing about the ocean, great
[1:07:33] works of poetry about the ocean, but yet
[1:07:36] he had never seen the ocean. So one day
[1:07:38] he decides what I've what I've written
[1:07:40] about what I've heard about I want to go
[1:07:42] see it. He wanted to go see another
[1:07:44] world. Amen. So he starts walking down
[1:07:46] towards the towards the ocean and you
[1:07:48] know first of course before he ever sees
[1:07:50] the sea he hears the boom of the waves.
[1:07:53] I love that sound. I grew up listening
[1:07:54] to that sound in Gizb hearing the boom
[1:07:56] of the surf just a couple of blocks
[1:07:58] away. You know he begins to hear that.
[1:07:59] Then the salt smell comes into his
[1:08:01] nostrils. You know so he begins to
[1:08:03] experience that which he's only written
[1:08:04] about. And you know, he begins a bit,
[1:08:06] you know, get a bit happier, lighter in
[1:08:08] his step, more more excited. But then as
[1:08:10] he's going on down his way to the ocean,
[1:08:12] you know, he sees this old salt, you
[1:08:14] know, this old sailor, this old
[1:08:16] fisherman who's there with a big bed,
[1:08:18] he's got a pipe in his mouth, and he's,
[1:08:19] you know, encrusted in salt. And, you
[1:08:22] know, this, you know, this sailor sees
[1:08:23] this um sees this young poet says, "Yo,
[1:08:26] good day to you. Where are you going?"
[1:08:27] And this, you know, this poet's super
[1:08:29] excited. And, you know, he's walking
[1:08:31] down there and he says, "Well, I'm on my
[1:08:33] way to see the ocean. I'm a poet. I've
[1:08:35] written about the um ocean all my life.
[1:08:37] But finally, it's my opportunity, my
[1:08:39] time to come and see it. But then this
[1:08:42] old salt, he just spat, you know, spat
[1:08:43] on the ground, took a puff of his pipe,
[1:08:45] and said, "Oh, there's nothing to it. I
[1:08:47] was born on this thing. I was raised on
[1:08:49] this thing. I worked on this thing, and
[1:08:51] I'll die probably on this ocean as well.
[1:08:53] There's nothing to it." And you see what
[1:08:55] had happened is is the ocean the sailor
[1:08:59] was not sufficiently impressed anymore
[1:09:02] by the ocean by the word. I mean because
[1:09:05] if you think about he says you know
[1:09:06] there's nothing special about it. I was
[1:09:08] born on it. So he wasn't sufficiently
[1:09:09] impressed by the very thing that shaped
[1:09:12] who he was which is the ocean. Now you
[1:09:15] could you could take the ocean. Yo yo I
[1:09:18] love to hear the boom of the surf. The
[1:09:20] thunder of the waves. Amen. You know,
[1:09:22] it's like when the wind begins to move,
[1:09:24] the Holy Spirit begins to move upon the
[1:09:26] word. Amen. The washing by the water of
[1:09:28] the word and the word begins to move and
[1:09:30] you hear the voice of God thunder out.
[1:09:32] Hallelujah. I mean, something that stirs
[1:09:34] my soul when you hear the word of God
[1:09:36] preached by, you know, under the
[1:09:38] inspiration. Amen. You know, but but the
[1:09:40] salt just saw what's going to be harder
[1:09:42] to go fishing today. Harder trouble.
[1:09:45] See, he had lost his enthusiasm and now
[1:09:48] it was just a burden to be a fisherman.
[1:09:51] You know the you the I love to see the
[1:09:53] sun reflecting off the ocean. You got to
[1:09:56] see the sunlight of the you know reflect
[1:09:58] off the word of God. And you can see the
[1:10:00] sun you can see Jesus Christ in the
[1:10:03] ocean. Hallelujah. As the as the
[1:10:06] anointing reflects it off. Amen. And I
[1:10:08] don't know if anyone's experienced but
[1:10:09] who's ever truly become salt encrusted.
[1:10:12] I remember sailing many times, young
[1:10:14] boy, you know, waves washing over you,
[1:10:16] everything, and you the sun dries you
[1:10:18] off and you're basically just one big
[1:10:19] salt crystal by the time you get into
[1:10:22] the get into the beach. Amen. It's a
[1:10:24] glorious feeling. Hallelujah. Why?
[1:10:26] Because when the when the water when the
[1:10:28] word moves, it makes you salty. Amen.
[1:10:31] There's a spring in your step. Amen. You
[1:10:33] come out those doors with joy bells
[1:10:36] ringing. Doesn't matter what's going on
[1:10:37] in life, there's a joy that's ringing
[1:10:39] deep in your soul. you become salty.
[1:10:42] Amen. It changes your outlook, you know.
[1:10:44] But you know, the salty thought, well,
[1:10:45] that's just work. I've just got to, you
[1:10:47] know, the old, you know, the old um
[1:10:49] fisherman, well, I've just got to wash
[1:10:50] off and I hate salt and all these
[1:10:52] things. Why? It became common to him.
[1:10:55] Amen. The joy of catching a prize fish
[1:10:57] out of the
[1:10:58] ocean. It was just work to the old salt.
[1:11:01] It became common. The thing that he was
[1:11:03] on was feeding him, sustaining him, but
[1:11:06] he took it for granted.
[1:11:09] There's prize fish in here. There's a
[1:11:11] prize meal in here. Hallelujah. Amen. I
[1:11:15] trust we haven't lost our enthusiasm
[1:11:19] for for where we live in the word of
[1:11:22] God. Amen. You know, big storms come.
[1:11:26] You know, I was enjoying the storm we
[1:11:28] had, you know, this this wind. I was
[1:11:30] enjoying it. You know, I went outside
[1:11:32] and you can hear the wind. It makes
[1:11:34] different sounds. as it goes through
[1:11:35] different trees, you know, and it kind
[1:11:37] of reminded me of a good oldfashioned
[1:11:39] meeting. You know, the spirit of God
[1:11:40] begins to blow. Amen. And it creates a
[1:11:43] different sounding hallelujah out of all
[1:11:45] the trees. I mean, out of all the
[1:11:47] bushes, amen, as the wind begins to
[1:11:48] blow. Amen. What a different hallelujah.
[1:11:50] Different praise comes out. It's all
[1:11:52] praising the same God. And we all have
[1:11:54] the life of God in us, right? But it
[1:11:56] reminded me of that. I just stood out
[1:11:57] there for a while and I just enjoyed the
[1:11:59] sound of it there. Or that epic kind of,
[1:12:01] you know, I love that sound. And and you
[1:12:03] know what I love about that kind of a
[1:12:05] storm when the spirit of God blows. See,
[1:12:06] it's not just persecution that makes our
[1:12:08] roots go down deeper. The wind of
[1:12:10] persecution. No, it's the wind of the
[1:12:12] Holy Spirit shakes us. Cause our roots
[1:12:15] to go deeper. Amen. You get moved by the
[1:12:17] spirit. Moved by the word and it touches
[1:12:20] your heart. What's happening? Your roots
[1:12:21] are going down deeper. Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] And I love to see a green tree. You
[1:12:27] know, you know, you know, we normally
[1:12:28] say green is inexperienced. Oh. Oh, that
[1:12:30] guy's green behind the whatever. You
[1:12:33] know, that guy's green. He's not
[1:12:34] experienced. But we need to stay green.
[1:12:36] Not in a experienced way, but in a
[1:12:38] flexible way. Amen. I love to see a tree
[1:12:41] that's green can just sway. Sway in the
[1:12:44] breeze. Move as the word moves them.
[1:12:46] Amen. But one without any leaves is a
[1:12:48] mournful sound. I don't believe there's
[1:12:50] any mournful sounds in here this
[1:12:52] morning.
[1:12:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[1:12:57] that salt, you know, that old that old
[1:12:59] sailor, it he wasn't sufficiently
[1:13:02] impressed. Another thing that happens
[1:13:04] when a storm whips up on the sea is all
[1:13:06] the trash gets washed out onto the bank.
[1:13:08] Amen. We went down to Eastborne and we
[1:13:09] saw the seaweed and trash and be washed
[1:13:12] up by that storm. And you know what?
[1:13:14] Some people they see, "Oh man, now we
[1:13:16] just got to clean up now." And some
[1:13:18] people subconsciously, I hate to say it,
[1:13:20] they don't want revival. They don't want
[1:13:22] the spirit of God to move because when
[1:13:24] the spirit of God moves, trash gets
[1:13:26] taken out of people's lives. Complexes,
[1:13:28] pains, hurts, secret sins, all these
[1:13:31] things just get washed out and then all
[1:13:33] these things are up on the bank and
[1:13:34] people say, "Oh, now we've just got to
[1:13:35] take care of this trash." Praise God for
[1:13:37] taking care of trash. It means it's not
[1:13:39] in a person anymore.
[1:13:41] Hallelujah. So, spirit of God, move.
[1:13:44] Touch our hearts, Lord. Change us, Lord.
[1:13:46] Get into those secret places. Amen.
[1:13:49] Manipulate us, Lord. Mold us, shape us.
[1:13:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We got to
[1:13:55] realize that whatever the enemy sends us
[1:13:58] is never enough to
[1:13:59] win. Amen. Now, it depends what you're
[1:14:02] looking at. I'm looking at my standard.
[1:14:04] Amen. Who's with me now? Amen. There's,
[1:14:07] you know, in Noah's age, the mockers and
[1:14:10] scientific research of that age were
[1:14:12] never enough to stop Noah. He could not
[1:14:14] be stopped. Amen. Egypt wasn't enough to
[1:14:17] stop Moses. S and remember Satan was in
[1:14:20] Pharaoh. God was in Moses. Everything
[1:14:22] Satan had in Egypt was never enough.
[1:14:24] Could not stop Moses getting the
[1:14:27] children of Israel out of Egypt. You
[1:14:29] know, if Moses just saw looked at looked
[1:14:31] at his humanity, 80-year-old man,
[1:14:34] shepherd staff, that's all he had. He
[1:14:36] was going into the superpower of the
[1:14:37] age. If he was just looking at himself,
[1:14:39] he thought there is no way that God can
[1:14:42] fulfill his prophecy of deliverance out
[1:14:45] of out of Egypt if he just looked at at
[1:14:47] his humanity. But when he saw God in the
[1:14:49] burning bush, when he received that
[1:14:52] commission, when he saw that God was
[1:14:53] with him, he thought, "It's impossible
[1:14:55] for Egypt to hold us."
[1:14:58] Hallelujah. Amen. Goliath wasn't enough
[1:15:02] for
[1:15:03] David. Naturally, Goliath should have
[1:15:05] just stood on just should have stood on
[1:15:08] David like a bug. Naturally, right? But
[1:15:11] because David knew the Lord. So, see,
[1:15:13] revelation will prevail. Amen. See, the
[1:15:16] standard is a revelation. It's not a
[1:15:17] learning. Learn it all you want. Go for
[1:15:19] it. But let it become a revelation. Let
[1:15:21] the word become quickened into your
[1:15:22] heart. And because David went out there
[1:15:24] with a revelation that this
[1:15:26] uncircumcised Philistine is going down,
[1:15:28] nothing could stop him. Amen. Nothing
[1:15:31] could stop him. So all of Goliath's
[1:15:33] training and his and his reputation and
[1:15:35] his ability could not stop David. Amen.
[1:15:39] If David just looked at himself, he
[1:15:40] thought there's how can I kill this guy?
[1:15:42] But when we looked at God's promise, he
[1:15:44] thought, "It's impossible for Goliath to
[1:15:46] live another day." Amen. You got to see
[1:15:49] your problems the same way. Amen. When
[1:15:51] you look at your standard, you realize
[1:15:52] this thing is going down. Amen. This
[1:15:55] problem is going down. This this
[1:15:56] Goliath, this giant that's taunted me
[1:15:58] for day after day after day. Who has a
[1:16:02] who's ever had that? So, I'm feel like
[1:16:04] I'm struggling to get words out right
[1:16:05] now, but but who who's ever had that
[1:16:07] you'll never overcome this this anxiety?
[1:16:10] You'll never you know, because you're
[1:16:11] built this way, right? This is your This
[1:16:12] is your temperament. You know, this is
[1:16:14] how you're born. You always be an
[1:16:15] anxious, nervous person. What was that?
[1:16:17] That's a Goliath just trying to hold you
[1:16:19] there. I say, "No, no. Look at your
[1:16:22] standard that's been lifted and you
[1:16:24] realize this thing can't hold me.
[1:16:26] Negativity couldn't hold me." Amen. All
[1:16:29] the problems of this world can't hold
[1:16:30] me. No, I cannot be held. Amen. Cuz the
[1:16:33] one who couldn't be contained by the
[1:16:34] grave comes and lives in me. Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. So nothing could
[1:16:41] stop David. Amen. Why? It's because
[1:16:45] nothing because the grace of God came to
[1:16:47] them and anointed the word of their age
[1:16:49] to them. Praise the Lord. Now if you
[1:16:53] take Passover night, the blood's been
[1:16:56] applied. There's darkness covering the
[1:16:58] Well, it didn't. I don't think it
[1:17:00] covered Go. They had light in their
[1:17:01] dwellings. That was the main thing. But
[1:17:02] you know, just imagine we're in Passover
[1:17:04] night. That first Passover. You're the
[1:17:06] firstborn. We have some firstborns here.
[1:17:08] E I'm number two.
[1:17:11] But you see there's firstborns there. So
[1:17:13] imagine now you are the firstborn in a
[1:17:15] family in Passover night. What are you
[1:17:17] looking at? The father applies the
[1:17:19] blood. Of course in sincerity and
[1:17:21] reverence with thanksgiving because he
[1:17:23] knew in his heart that every word the
[1:17:25] prophet said worked. Amen. The prophet
[1:17:29] said, "Let fleas come, frogs, flies,
[1:17:31] locust, whatever it all happened."
[1:17:33] Right? So now the prophet said it's time
[1:17:35] to apply the blood. We're leaving. Amen.
[1:17:38] Now, now, now the firstborn could panic
[1:17:40] all he wanted if he was looking at the
[1:17:43] circumstances. You mean death's going to
[1:17:45] strike? You mean you mean the
[1:17:46] firstborn's going to die and I'm the
[1:17:48] firstborn? If he was looking at his
[1:17:50] humanity or even at his father's
[1:17:52] humanity, then he could he could think,
[1:17:53] "How on earth is this going to work?"
[1:17:55] But if he turned his eyes from those
[1:17:57] things and turned his eyes to the
[1:17:58] promised word, he'd realize, "I'm as
[1:18:00] safe as safe could be." You know,
[1:18:04] Brother Brham says, "It's not even the
[1:18:05] preacher that prays for you that gave
[1:18:06] the promise.
[1:18:08] God gave the promise. Amen. Well, so and
[1:18:11] so prayed for me. No, no, it's the
[1:18:13] promise. Preachers don't give promises.
[1:18:16] God gave the promise. Your faith in the
[1:18:19] promise will cause it to come to pass.
[1:18:20] Amen. Cuz God gave the promise. Amen. So
[1:18:23] the father could say, "Son, you're
[1:18:25] looking at the wrong thing. Don't look
[1:18:27] at me. Don't look at yourself. Look at
[1:18:29] the promised word that's come into our
[1:18:31] house. We've applied the blood." Amen.
[1:18:33] It's impossible for you to be lost, my
[1:18:35] son, because the blood has been applied.
[1:18:39] Hallelujah. Amen. So, he can go from
[1:18:42] panicking to rejoicing.
[1:18:44] Amen. Well, how do you apply the blood,
[1:18:46] the token in this day? As I said, repent
[1:18:48] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:18:49] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:18:51] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:18:53] the Holy Ghost. Amen. So then what do
[1:18:55] you do now? So after the standard has
[1:18:57] been raised, what do you do? Start
[1:18:58] thanking him for it. Start praising him.
[1:19:00] The promise is here. Amen. See, we're
[1:19:02] not looking for, okay, we're looking for
[1:19:04] Jesus to physically come. Okay? But in
[1:19:06] terms of the promised word coming to be
[1:19:08] fulfilled, it's already here, right?
[1:19:10] Right? So, we can thank God, he's raised
[1:19:13] his standard. Amen. So, we can be begin
[1:19:16] to thank God that every promise he's
[1:19:18] given us is here now to be fulfilled.
[1:19:21] Amen. So, don't be down and don't look
[1:19:23] at this world and all its troubles. No,
[1:19:25] look at the standard that has been
[1:19:26] raised. Amen. And it says in Proverbs
[1:19:29] 17:22, "A merry heart doeth good like a
[1:19:32] medicine, but a broken spirit dryth the
[1:19:34] bones." Now, to me, that's more than
[1:19:35] just a natural effect of your body. It's
[1:19:38] your spirit. So, if you're looking if
[1:19:41] you're looking at this world and its
[1:19:42] problems and situations in life, how can
[1:19:45] you have a merry heart?
[1:19:47] Right? But if you're looking at the
[1:19:48] standard that's been raised, that will
[1:19:50] give you a merry heart. You'll begin to
[1:19:52] rejoice in the trouble, rejoice in the
[1:19:55] storm. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] And then what happens? That begins to
[1:19:59] spread onto other people. Why? Why are
[1:20:02] you so positive? How's life going? Well,
[1:20:04] this has happened. This has happened.
[1:20:06] This Yeah, but why are you positive in
[1:20:07] it? Well, let me tell you. I'm looking
[1:20:10] at something else. I'm looking at my
[1:20:12] Lord. I mean, I'm looking at the one
[1:20:14] who's the promisekeeper, the light in my
[1:20:16] darkness. Amen. He's my God. He's my way
[1:20:18] maker. Amen. We should be the most
[1:20:21] positive people in all the world in
[1:20:23] spite of everything that's going on.
[1:20:25] Amen. See, nothing could hold our Lord.
[1:20:29] Death couldn't hold him. The tomb
[1:20:31] couldn't hold him. The Roman seal
[1:20:33] couldn't hold him. Nothing could stop
[1:20:35] our Lord Jesus. It says even Acts 2:24,
[1:20:38] Amen, that it was even impossible. It
[1:20:40] was not possible that death should hold
[1:20:42] him. You know, he was loose from the
[1:20:44] pains of death. Amen. And the reason he
[1:20:47] did is because he went to he went to
[1:20:49] Calvary with one scripture that he would
[1:20:51] rise again. And the scripture was Psalm
[1:20:54] 16:10. For thou will not leave my soul
[1:20:55] in hell, neither will thou suffer thine
[1:20:57] holy one to see corruption. I will not
[1:21:00] suffer I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. I will not
[1:21:02] leave my soul in hell, neither will thou
[1:21:04] suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
[1:21:06] That was a promise that was anchored in
[1:21:08] the heart of the Lord Jesus. So as a
[1:21:10] man, he had a revelation that I'm not
[1:21:13] staying in the grave. I'm coming out.
[1:21:16] Amen. So with that one scripture, he
[1:21:17] went to Calvary. Amen. And the
[1:21:20] revelation of that one scripture
[1:21:22] conquered hell, death, and the grave.
[1:21:26] Now remember, you've got a scripture,
[1:21:27] too. We shall not all sleep, but we
[1:21:30] shall be changed in a moment, in a
[1:21:32] twinkling of an eye. That's the standard
[1:21:34] that has been raised in your life as a
[1:21:36] resurrection standard. Amen. That he is
[1:21:38] the resurrection and the life, and he
[1:21:39] has raised that. Amen. So, if you look
[1:21:41] at that, you realize I'm going to be
[1:21:43] changed. Amen. If I'm going to be
[1:21:45] changed, then my family's going to be
[1:21:46] changed.
[1:21:48] Hallelujah. See, if you look at the the
[1:21:51] flood that's coming, you you think,
[1:21:53] well, unbelief is going to hinder God.
[1:21:55] Unbelief doesn't hinder God. That's
[1:21:57] right. Brother Ram says many people
[1:21:59] think it does, but it does not. God has
[1:22:03] a program and his program is, as John
[1:22:05] said, he's able of these stones to raise
[1:22:07] up children to Abraham. Amen. That's his
[1:22:10] So, so that's his program. Amen. So,
[1:22:12] nothing will hinder God in this age.
[1:22:14] Yeah. We think, oh, there's unbelief on
[1:22:16] every hand. man, it's going to hinder
[1:22:17] God moving in my life. Absolutely not.
[1:22:19] Why? Because he said he'll raise up
[1:22:21] stones to be children of Abraham. I
[1:22:23] said, I'm looking at some stones, amen,
[1:22:25] that have been risen up. Amen. Came out
[1:22:26] of nowhere. Amen. Out of drug dens and
[1:22:29] pubs and bars and sport and all these
[1:22:30] kind of things in the world. God just
[1:22:32] called you. Say, I'm going to raise you
[1:22:33] up as children because you are my
[1:22:36] children. Hallelujah.
[1:22:39] Amen. Why? Because God that that's God's
[1:22:41] program.
[1:22:43] Amen. But remember now he has done it
[1:22:46] for a purpose. I'm going to be winding
[1:22:48] up a bit
[1:22:51] soon. It's you know it's the same thing
[1:22:53] if we look at this standard. You know
[1:22:54] brotherwood when he preached it's the
[1:22:56] rising of the sun. He went to Leviticus
[1:22:58] he spoke about how there was a there was
[1:23:00] a wave sheath offering that had been
[1:23:02] offered. So what happened is well you
[1:23:04] know if you look at corn or or wheat or
[1:23:06] any plant like that well anything you
[1:23:08] know that's that's grown right part of
[1:23:10] it matures before the other part right
[1:23:13] so what they did is they took a part of
[1:23:15] the field that had come mature they cut
[1:23:17] it down it was given to the priests and
[1:23:20] and he would wave it before the Lord
[1:23:22] thanking God the rest of the harvest in
[1:23:24] the field was going to come to the same
[1:23:26] condition as the one that was cut down
[1:23:27] and waved right and brother said that
[1:23:29] the that the life that that Christ is
[1:23:31] our wave sheath offering, right? And
[1:23:33] he's been waved over the people. Amen.
[1:23:35] This anointed word has been waved over
[1:23:37] the people. And and what is it? It's
[1:23:39] it's God giving thanks, saying the rest
[1:23:42] of the field, rest of the seed in the
[1:23:44] field will come to maturity just like
[1:23:46] him. Amen. Brother Ram says the same
[1:23:48] thing has happened in this end time
[1:23:50] through the message as God has waved
[1:23:52] what a standard has been raised of a
[1:23:54] life that's been lived of the word. It's
[1:23:56] been put in front of you. Amen. That and
[1:23:59] God is saying hallelujah. Because the
[1:24:01] rest of the seed in the field are going
[1:24:03] to come to the same maturity as the w as
[1:24:06] the life that's been waved. Amen. So, so
[1:24:10] now if you look at the field now, there
[1:24:12] could be remember the field is the
[1:24:14] world, right? And we can be planted in
[1:24:17] all kinds of things. We can be planted
[1:24:19] in a dry part, right? Seed wheat seed
[1:24:22] can be in a dry part of the field. Can
[1:24:24] be in a bogggy part of the field. It can
[1:24:26] be in a stony part of the field. It
[1:24:27] could be a part where there's lots of
[1:24:29] weeds with a part where there's lots of
[1:24:30] shade. Don't look at those things. You
[1:24:33] say, "You don't know my background. You
[1:24:35] don't know what I came out of." Don't
[1:24:36] look at what you came out of. Look at
[1:24:38] what you're being made into. Amen.
[1:24:40] Because remember, it's the wheat that
[1:24:42] was gathered. So the wheat that was
[1:24:44] waved, the same life in the wheat. So
[1:24:46] the same life in Christ is the same life
[1:24:48] in you. Amen. That's why, remember, he
[1:24:51] said, "All the father has given me will
[1:24:54] come to me." Amen. and all that comes
[1:24:56] I'll know why he's cast out. So he's
[1:24:57] saying that that we are part of him.
[1:25:01] Amen. So you're going to realize now it
[1:25:03] doesn't matter what part of the earth or
[1:25:04] or whatever problems you're going
[1:25:06] through. God said you will become into
[1:25:09] the same likeness as his word. Amen. But
[1:25:12] what are you looking at? Are you looking
[1:25:14] at the shade that you're under by a
[1:25:16] tree? Are you looking at a rock that's
[1:25:17] pushing you this way? Are you looking at
[1:25:20] the problem? Because you think, man, how
[1:25:21] on earth you you you can look at some
[1:25:24] fields, you say, "How on earth are they
[1:25:25] going to get a harvest out of that
[1:25:26] section?" You're looking at the wrong
[1:25:28] thing, right? Are you with me? Amen. No.
[1:25:31] No. You're looking at the wrong thing.
[1:25:33] Don't look at the problems around you.
[1:25:36] Look at the one that's been waved
[1:25:38] over you. The life of God. This message
[1:25:41] has been waved over you. saying that
[1:25:43] what you see in the message of a life,
[1:25:45] an overcoming life, a one that can love,
[1:25:49] can forgive, amen, can can turn the
[1:25:52] other cheek, can walk just like Jesus
[1:25:54] walked. See the character of Christ in a
[1:25:56] people that same life that you saw lived
[1:25:58] through the prophet what has come into
[1:26:00] you to produce the same
[1:26:02] thing.
[1:26:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Now I want you to read
[1:26:09] this one one verse with me and this is
[1:26:11] going to be one of my closing
[1:26:13] statements. So 1 Thessalonians 5
[1:26:16] and23. I heard brother Freddy quote this
[1:26:19] when he gave his testimony at the
[1:26:20] ministers meeting. I thought man this is
[1:26:22] absolutely powerful because it depends
[1:26:24] what you're looking at. Okay so let's
[1:26:26] just go to that 1 Thessalonians 5
[1:26:33] and23 because I I like to all read this
[1:26:37] together.
[1:26:38] Okay, I'd like us all to read this
[1:26:40] together. Okay, he says this here now.
[1:26:43] Is everyone there? Or you can look at
[1:26:45] the screen, whatever you want to do.
[1:26:47] Because remember, you think if you're
[1:26:48] looking at the flood that's coming, you
[1:26:51] think, how on earth can I get out of
[1:26:52] here? Right? But if you look at the
[1:26:54] standard that's been raised, you think,
[1:26:55] how on earth can I not get out of here?
[1:26:59] Okay. He says now and the very God of
[1:27:02] peace sanctify you holy and I pray God
[1:27:06] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:27:08] preserved blameless until the coming of
[1:27:10] our Lord Jesus Christ. So he's praying
[1:27:12] now that all you are your body, spirit,
[1:27:15] soul will be preserved blameless. In
[1:27:17] other words, there's no sin, nothing, no
[1:27:20] ought that can be held against you. It's
[1:27:21] all gone. Be preserved, be kept. And
[1:27:24] then we go to the next verse.
[1:27:27] Faithful is he that calleth you, who
[1:27:29] also will do it.
[1:27:32] Hallelujah. Amen. So he's praying God,
[1:27:35] you know, I pray to God that you pre be
[1:27:36] preserved and all these things
[1:27:38] blameless. But he says, "Faithful is he
[1:27:39] that calleth you." He will do that.
[1:27:42] Amen. Now, if you look at yourself, you
[1:27:44] think, how on earth can that happen? But
[1:27:45] if you look at him, you think, God,
[1:27:47] you're going to do it. You're doing it.
[1:27:49] Hallelujah.
[1:27:51] Amen. So, so in
[1:27:55] closing, what you're looking at affects
[1:27:57] your attitude, the atmosphere you carry,
[1:27:59] and how you treat others. If you look at
[1:28:01] the flood, you won't have a positive
[1:28:03] attitude. Your atmosphere will be
[1:28:05] negative, and you'll treat others with
[1:28:08] contempt and disdain and just be
[1:28:09] stressful and anxious, right? But if you
[1:28:12] look at the standard that's been raised,
[1:28:14] you'll love everybody. Amen. There'll be
[1:28:17] a atmosphere of the love of God around
[1:28:19] you. Amen. You'll be salty. Praise the
[1:28:22] Lord. There'll be just an atmosphere.
[1:28:23] People want to be around you. Why?
[1:28:25] Because you're looking, you're not
[1:28:26] looking at yourself. You're looking at
[1:28:28] the standard that's been lifted. Amen.
[1:28:30] It will affect what you say. Just like
[1:28:33] just like Elisha said, Lord, open his
[1:28:35] eyes. There's more for us gahazi than
[1:28:37] there are against us. Why? He had he was
[1:28:40] certain of God that God was there to
[1:28:42] deliver them. Amen. And as I said,
[1:28:47] Martin Luther, he said, "When I look at
[1:28:48] myself, I can't see how I can be saved.
[1:28:50] But when I look at Christ, I don't see
[1:28:52] how I can be lost." Amen. And what are
[1:28:56] you looking at? Yourself or you looking
[1:28:58] at him? Now, say like Pilot said,
[1:29:00] "Behold the man. Behold his lovely face.
[1:29:02] Behold his word." Has he ever failed?
[1:29:06] Can he fail? Then why worry? Just give
[1:29:10] him thanks that he has given you light.
[1:29:12] Give him thanks. He's brought salvation
[1:29:14] your way. Give him thanks that he has
[1:29:16] redeemed you by his blood. Give him
[1:29:18] thanks that he is working all things
[1:29:20] after the council of his own will. Amen.
[1:29:22] That there's nothing there's nothing
[1:29:24] that is out of his control.
[1:29:26] We can have we can be certain of God
[1:29:29] that he is in control in every
[1:29:30] situation. And what does that cause us
[1:29:32] to do? Rejoice.
[1:29:35] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's have the
[1:29:37] musicians uh this morning,
[1:29:40] please. Amen.
[1:29:43] [Applause]
[1:29:51] Amen. I think we should sing that.
[1:29:53] Magnify the Lord with me. Amen. Let's
[1:29:56] magnify his name. Isn't he good?
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. Oh, taste and see that the
[1:30:04] Lord is good. If you have not tasted
[1:30:05] you, just open your heart. Say, Lord, I
[1:30:07] want to taste you, Lord. I've heard of
[1:30:09] thee, but I want to see you. Amen. You
[1:30:11] may be looking all just the natural
[1:30:12] problems things. I say Lord open our
[1:30:15] open our eyes Lord. Amen. Let's stand.
[1:30:19] Amen. I sought the
[1:30:22] Lord and he answered
[1:30:26] me and delivered
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:29] me from every
[1:30:33] fear. Those who look on
[1:30:37] him are
[1:30:40] radant. They'll never be
[1:30:44] ashamed. They'll never be
[1:30:48] ashamed. This poor man cried.
[1:30:53] And he answered
[1:30:55] me and saved me
[1:30:59] from my
[1:31:03] eneies. The son of
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:07] God surrounds his
[1:31:10] saints. He will deliver
[1:31:14] them. He will deliver them.

[1:48:15] Gracious father, thank you, Lord. we
[1:48:17] could look to you. Hallelujah. Lord
[1:48:19] Jesus, thank you for opening our eyes so
[1:48:21] we can see you in this day. Father, see
[1:48:23] the standard you have raised. As your
[1:48:25] word says, when the enemy comes in like
[1:48:27] a flood, I'll raise up a standard
[1:48:28] against him. Lord and truly, you've
[1:48:30] raised up a mighty standard that cannot
[1:48:32] be conquered, cannot be downed, Lord,
[1:48:33] which is your anointed word in our
[1:48:35] lives. So, Father, I ask that we would
[1:48:37] not look at the flood. Sure, it's here,
[1:48:39] but Lord, may we not look at that, my
[1:48:40] God, but may we look to you, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:43] And father, as Martin Luther said, when
[1:48:45] I look at myself, I cannot see how I
[1:48:47] cannot um I can't see how I can be
[1:48:50] saved, but when I look at Christ, I
[1:48:52] can't see how I can be lost, Lord. And
[1:48:54] may we just look to you, Father, because
[1:48:56] we know every need. I mean, Father,
[1:48:58] every answer to every need, Lord, you're
[1:49:00] the Lord, is in you, dear God. You're
[1:49:02] the answer to every situation, Lord
[1:49:04] Jesus. May we just look to you. And I
[1:49:06] want to pray for everyone here, Lord.
[1:49:07] Lord, if there's some here that like
[1:49:08] Gahazi, their eyes have have not come
[1:49:11] open to the supernatural realm, Lord.
[1:49:13] That you are with us. You're in us to
[1:49:14] the end of the world, Lord. They're
[1:49:16] still looking at carnal things only.
[1:49:17] Open their eyes, Lord. Open their eyes
[1:49:19] to the reality of your word, that you're
[1:49:21] mighty in battle. You're the same
[1:49:22] yesterday, today, and forever. That
[1:49:24] you're faithful and true, Lord. Father,
[1:49:26] you will fulfill your word. Grant it,
[1:49:28] dear God. We love you, Lord. And we
[1:49:30] thank you for this day in Jesus Christ's
[1:49:32] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[1:49:36] friends. Just a reminder, there's a
