be in the presence of the Lord it's good to be with fellow Believers that come with the LI of fire to worship and praise God the word that I have over you this evening is surrender and maybe we we think Lord give me Victory give me power give me all these things but we get none of that none of that unless we make a total surrender you know the Lord tries to overtake us with his love we we see our life going going down and things and it's the Lord trying to overtake us and when we're finally ready to surrender he hands us terms and conditions which are total surrender and you know if we're not ready to make a total surrender he'll keep battling on there's no half measures there's no I'll give you some and I'll keep the rest I don't want to make it sound hard but if we want the Holy Ghost it's a total surrender you got to say Lord I to totally surrender I totally surrender there's no unless you forsake all and follow me you cannot be my disciple that's the truth you know when I'm when I really made the total surrender a song came and it was oh sweet Jesus take my life all its failings all its Strife you're the only thing I've ever done that's right I Surrender now completely wrap your arms around me sweetly as I hear you softly say you are mine and I believe you know if you haven't received the Holy Ghost and made that total surrender you will tonight and you know even if you've gone on down the road you actually need to surrender daily what as Paul said I Die daily I Surrender daily we can go on in our walk and then start to get a little bit and we start to stand up against God a bit more than what we used to we do and we need to stop that we need to say Lord I Die daily I Surrender daily but we are of those that surrender cuz that's why we're [Music] here the song I'm going to sing is I am marked you know when you make a surrender and you become the Lord you get marked oh that's that person they're funny people that's right as long as he doesn't think I'm

mean we could give that to the devil but they've decided to give it to the Lord amen amen so this is the um just as they get set up so I made a wee bit of um put your hand up Sister Priscilla so we bit of fun with fun of her this morning because she asked you know for her item to be first so no one if someone has the same item they won't do it but um well they would have to change the item um I had the same fears I'm being honest remember last year we did we had two churches do the same item so we I figured well the only way to get around that is maybe if we write one ourselves a new song then unless people were really spiritual and you know caught the same inspiration then they wouldn't know the song you know so we we wouldn't risk it but um we had um just as they're getting set up so we yeah I sort of said that to the choir I said now they were putting forward songs I said now let's let's write one and we'll expect the Lord to just give us one that we can sing at the camp and do it but it was um time was running out I think it was a Wednesday and we had to have the first practice on the Sunday and then we had one more practice and then it was the camp so yeah we we w't as tight spot so we um went to church on a Wednesday and brother um adaman spoke about dry bones and how speak to the dry bones Speak Life and um you know you just hear something and it kind of came it comes alive and so um this is I guess a little song We Made For You at the camp here um I like slower songs I write slower mow mellow songs I just play the guitar and St and more heartfelt but I find with a choir they get they've got a short attention span they like it to sort of you know you got to be moving hey you do a slow one they're like no I don't do that I sent forward slow songs no boring you know you got to it's got to move so this is like a little bit different than what I usually write but it's they wanted something with a bit of snap so are we ready 1 2 three 4 [Music] Valley of D

may we just lay aside everything Lord Lord every distraction every Everything of the day Lord and may we just lay it all aside as we come into your presence Lord and may you just have your way in the hearts and lives of your children and Lord we'll just be sure to give you the glory and all these things we ask amen amen if you have your Bibles we just turn to the book of Isaiah thank you m Isaiah thank you musicians and just a little thought on our heart tonight and uh just pray the Lord give us Grace Isaiah 60 and then we'll go to Isaiah 21 just a couple verses in each 60 Isaiah 60 veres 1-2 a familiar reading to all of us um brother brandom used it in the many times and in the message Shalom it says arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and in then in chapter 21 of Isaiah uh just just verses 11 and 12 I'd like to take a thought tonight on it's time to shine it's time to shine verses 11 and 12 there um it says the burden of Duma he calleth to me out of s Watchman what of the night Watchman what of the night and the Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come and me you may have your seats and we just want to take this little thought on it's time to shine and brother brandom would show us that the heavens are a type of what's going to happen on Earth how God wrote his first Bible in the heavens how how you could look at at Vergo and Leo and it would declare his first coming through a virgin birth and his second coming as Leo the Lion and in the heavens would declare what what what God would show us in the scripture and what what what God was going to do on the Earth Earth and we brother brother brandom says that every Christian is a star and we know that God speaks through the heavens and so he he even called the children of Israel as the stars and and he would say these these are my children and and Abraham tried to number them they're as the stars of the sky and and so we know it's a very very powerful type and and God uses stars all throughout the Bible the star led the wise men and and brother brandom said what did the star mean to us today friend and and then he goes to Daniel he said Daniel gives us the answer in Daniel 12:3 it said those that are wise and know their God shall shine as the firmaments of the heaven and those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the Stars forever and ever and so he says what are we today then he said We Are Stars he said every born again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ a star to reflect reflect the power and Holiness of the Lord Jesus to reflect him in his life and to perfect him in his speech to perfect him in his healing power to perfect him in his resurrection to reflect him in every way that he was reflected To Us by God the Father we are stars and uh I may just do a little reading to lay a foundation here so just bear with me um but he said every Christian is a star to guide the lost to guide the weary the star cannot be guarded by uh Guided by itself it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the brilliancy of God in its life to abstain from the things of the world to live Godly and soberly in this present life it must reflect the light of this great one that shined and and and a star is not Guided by its own power it's Guided by another power and the Bible tell us that that there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and so as Christians to reflect the presence of God we're not looking to be guided by our own our own selves or or our own mental Powers but we're Guided by a higher power and we're meant to abstain from the things of the world we're not meant to blend in with the world we're not we're not meant to build a church that looks like the churches of the world we're not meant to live a life that looks like the lives of the world but you're meant to be a separated people you're Meant To Be A peculiar people and Abstract people according to the ways of the world but glorious according to the word of God he said come out from among them and be separate touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you separate yourselves onto this word for the glory of God Amen not Guided by our own power and in 1 Corinthians 15:41 it says there is one glory of the sun another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star differ from another star in glory and brother B would take that and he said we're told in the Bible that the Stars differ one to another one star differs from another he said there's a difference in Heavens and Angels Angelic beings there's angels and chims and seraphim he said they're different and we're all different we're not meant to compare our lives one to another and and our looks and our talents and our abilities because God has you where he wants you God has you where he needs you to be in the body of Christ and God's placed you there according to his knowledge of of of what you could do best and how you could serve the body of Christ best so we're not meant to get little schisms amongst us and little jealousies but one star differeth for from another amen and it would be becoming of you to serve the Lord according to what he's called you to do amen but we're not just going to talk about stars in general but specifically the Morning Star brother Brandon would tell us about the morning star and what does the morning star mean it it comes out just before Daybreak when all the other stars begin to fade away when the moon itself begins to fade away right at that day break that's when the Morning Star comes out and and brother BR said he stands alone he's God's Watchman that stands alone and what he's doing is that Sun's fixing to rise and that morning star stands up there as a Watchman to reflect that Sun reflect that Sun as it begins to rise and let us know that this Sun's fixing to rise we're fixing to see the Sun but we know it's there because we see its light reflecting on the morning star and it reflects the True Light of the true sun it's reflecting not its own light it's not reflecting the church light it's reflecting the light of the sun amen and brother Bram said what is it the Morning Star the Church of the Living God today and he says down he says what is the true Church's Ministry he said the ministry of that church will be the ministry of the sun because it's a reflection of the same sun power in the same sun light that the world will know when the Sun rises what it will look like he says it's ready to reflecting the light the suns are shining on the star he said now it isn't the church it isn't the person it's the sun reflecting on the star that reflects the sunlight to the Earth so if we could ever get back to the same light if you could ever get back to the sunlight that Shone in the life of Jesus Christ if you could ever come back to that same light that Shone on the day of Pentecost in the first church if you could ever get back to that light it'll have to produce the same Ministry for the same light will bring the same Ministry it'll bring the same power it'll bring the same signs it'll bring the same reflection because it's the same light amen and God's light doesn't change so we've seen it progress from Luther's light to Wesley's light to to Pentecostal light and now brother Brandon said the it's coming into that morning star begin to reflect and all the churches pulling out of every church every nation every people a bride for his nameen so brother Brandon would begin to describe this and Watchmen what of the night he said the Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquire your return come and brother B said Isaiah wasn't out of order he said Isaiah wasn't out of order when he said the night cometh in the morning morning cometh in the night also he said it wasn't out of order but said we know the moon shines in the absence of the sun because the light that we walk in is the light of the sun reflected from the Moon he said now that's what the church is supposed to do he said when the sun come uh what reflect the presence of God while the sun is gone and when the church comes up or when the sun comes up the moon's gone but just before day did you ever notice the moon gets real pale and it goes out and I'll tell you the church has already turned pale it's anemic it got away from the blood it got away from salvation and the Holy Ghost and the teaching of the word and it's become anemic so so we begin to see that there's a pattern here that there's a little bit of light and then there's darkness and then there's another light the breaking of the day so he's saying morning's coming but there's night coming first and mean and this is the order of the night and brother BR said we've had that first little light he said uh notice the morning cometh in the night also we've had a great Revival amongst the Full Gospel people it's been a a great thing we've seen healings done and signs and wonders but remember now he said the morning cometh but the night also he said it's begin to darken up again and he would tell how how they used to fill the buildings and and how they would see Mighty Miracles and he would tell a story about a Mr Mrs waldrup that raised from the dead he said they used to pack the churches and he would talk about this great first light this great campaign that would take place and he said now you preach 20 minutes and people get sick of it he said what happened there was a first little light but that Darkness Be to creep back in and he said the alarm went off and they shut the alarm off because it seemed like well maybe it's not time to get up yet so they shut the alarm off and went back to bed during that that first light and then Darkness began to creep in and instead of shining like the Morning Star should they went back to bed and they shut the alarm off he said brother brandom commands us not to do that he says don't shut the alarm off but this is the time when the Morning Star is supposed to rise and shine this is the time when you're supposed to rise and and trim your lamps and Shine for the glory of God he said don't shut your alarm off and say well uh we'll put it off to another day we'll put it off to another time there there may not be another day coming there may not be another time coming so don't shut the alarm I say you should get out of bed and and get about the business of the Lord and Shine for the glory of the Lord amen he said when the preacher warned of the coming of God and the coming of the Son of God he said don't turn your alarm off don't try to drown it don't go back into the world say I got a few Wild Oats to sew he said you 35 ye olders and you teenagers don't try that jump to your feet let the alarm glow that's God's holy spirit warning you to flee from the Wrath that is to come amen he said when that dark time comes then the Morning Star comes out and it's the brightest stars in the heaven is the Morning Star he said don't miss this now the Morning Star comes out between the little light spell and the real breaking of day as soon as it gets real dark just before the break of day The Morning Star shines its brightest and and we're living in a dark time we're living in the Leo DEA age where Darkness has come in but but though we're in the world we're not of the world and and though darkness is coming and though there's a great Darkness it it's time for the church to rise and shine amen is that the church is to reflect his light and God's light will be reflected in his church and more powerful than ever just before the coming of the Lord Jesus amen we see the order we see the order of the night and we know it's dark dark we all know it's dark and brother Brandon would preach a message Shalom he said behold in Isaiah 60 how we read it he said the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon these so the Watchman has a warned us that danger is approaching he he said that that that people would come and talk to him and say if the world knew what they were talking about amongst the the military and things he said they would be scared to death and and he would talk about these men com and say I wish I could could just you know take my old wagon and drive it out into the woods uh we were excited about advancements but it's got so far advanced in the hands of evil men that they're going to use it to destroy the world and they would try to escape it but what was it it was Darkness was approaching and and and we had a Watchman up in the tower that said it's the time it's the running out of time and the coming of the Lord we're witnessing them both at the same time the Watchmen could look up and see these things and he said morning is coming for those that are prepared prepared but night is coming for those that are not prepared and me it's darkness and gross Darkness we see Darkness on the earth we see modern events made clear by prophecy we see the world shaking and trembling all around us we see the darkness it it's easy to see the darkness and it's a Gloom that's hanging on the earth and it's also gross Darkness on the people uh it's a spiritual Darkness that's crept in on the people just to be a pretty good person just to be a good church member just to not really really ser serve the Lord under the reality of the word but just to go to church and fill a Pew and and just to put your name on a book or shake a hand it's spiritual darkness that has crept gross darkness that has crept over the people amen and and it's not just enough to be a be a part of the church for the church is condemned brother BR said we know she goes to outer Darkness but the bride goes up but he says what does that he said it's Pride it's Pride that gets in and because you want to fit in and and and you're not willing to fully cross over into the blessings of the word you you don't want your work friends and your school friends to to think that you're uh maybe a heretic or to think that you're some crazy man so you'll just kind of sit there in the middle and try to blend in and and it's Pride that gets in and tries to tries to keep you from fully entering in and and what it is it's it's what brother B would say is what does it all mean he said what made the moon Fade Out what made the moon which is the church Fade Out is it's the world got in its shadow he said the world shuts out the light that we're supposed to be reflecting swings itself around and gets into it and as they pass one another it throws Darkness over it he said the world has come into the church in the name of denomination the name of some Creed and we're religious and all this and all this but yet it denies the resurrecting power of Christ to vindicate the word that's prophesied for this day me what is it uh we are all familiar with the picture of the of the church ages and it has all the the different moon phases on it from the seven Church ages and and brother Brandon would tell us about this and he said recall that in the first stage it was almost a full orb Church of Truth and and it would go through in the next stage more Darkness crept in and and then Darkness covered the circle and the third age it was Eclipse still more and the fourth age which was the Dark Ages the light had all but gone and and and then he talks of course about restoration began to come and and Luther begin to come in Wesley and and light began to creep back in and and more light begin to creep back in but then in that seventh age when it looked like illumination was coming back to the church all of a sudden it went into total eclipse and it went into total darkness and and and brother BR said that in the seventh stage the total darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul the 6 went to Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem and and his name was Paul I 6 which brother Bram said was no coincidence because well Paul was the first Messenger to the age we all know that and this man goes by that name he said but notice it's the sixth or the number of man and when he went to Jerusalem the moon or the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass until all away until all be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come quickly and and it begins to tell about this Darkness the total eclipse of the church as this Pope visited Jerusalem and and and his name was Paul I 6 but we know that a pope is just an impostor of a true Prophet here here he was named Paul which was our first church age messenger but he was an impostor it was man it was darkness and and brother Brandon would talk about how uh um he said that that people would flock to him he said he was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem and and people would flock to him and people would bow down them and brother BR talks about how this Darkness spiritual darkness and and those going across the street might have worshiped them but they didn't realize that it it wasn't really a true light but it was a a a a total eclipse coming on the church amen and Christ was on the outside in that seventh age Christ was knocking at the door but the church shut him out the church didn't let him in and brother brandham but brother Brandon when he drew that last seventh moon in the seven Church agency put a little light in there and he put it in there for me and you because there was an elect upon the Earth that wasn't a part of that Darkness but they were a part of the light and mean we find that that that that natural Jerusalem is not is not our representation but in Revelations 21 it says I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and he said the Bride of the church is the New Jerusalem how many knows that the church itself is the New Jerusalem he said you believe that he said and we're taught in the New Testament in the message Shalom don't fail to get this in the New Testament that we are not of this city Jerusalem on Earth but we are from the New Jerusalem Above So then he says so this must be the Moon Jerusalem and not the noon Jerusalem above so the moon representing the church Earthly the Moon that was in total eclipse was representing Jerusalem Earthly but not Jerusalem Heavenly but we are of the city New Jerusalem we are the bride adorned for her husband a a and God put a light in this age because he knew there would be some Believers that wouldn't shut him out but they would let him in and we've received a true Prophet to Jerusalem and we're walking in True Light and our King isn't the pope but our King is MDC the King of Kings the Lord of lords without beginning of days or ending of days but he came from God God stepped into flesh and brought us a message and and God brought us a Word of Life in this day that we could walk in light that we wouldn't have to walk in darkness but we could walk in truth reveal Truth for this day amen aren't you thankful that God gave us a true Watchmen aren't you thankful that God gave us a true word of light amen we should never take it for granted and brother B said if God put them in there talking about a a five-fold Ministry and things he said they're qualified for the job God wouldn't put a man in a tower in a position like that that said the days of Miracles are passed God wouldn't put a man in the tower that said Jesus Christ was not the same yesterday today and forever God would not put a man in the tower that would preach a wishy-washy gospel and not tell the truth and warn the people of the Wrath that is to come but he put someone that's bold he said but he said God will never put a blind prophet in the tower God will never put someone with spiritual blindness in the tower but he put an eagle with Clear Vision in the tower that could look out and he could see the darkness and he could see the light and he could declare unto you what's coming and give you a proper warning Amen brother BR say if the Bible said that the baptism of Holy Ghost ceased then he would teach it that way but that's not what the Bible said he said if the Bible taught Miracles ceased with the apostles then he would teach that but that's not what the Bible said if the Bible would have said healing was no more then brother Brandon would have taught it because he was a word Prophet but because that's not what the Bible said brother brandom didn't teach that but he was high enough up to see the scriptures tying together and give you a true revelation of this word that you could walk in the light for your day amen because he was an eagle that's the reason he could get so high and see the light and the Darkness he could see the night's coming but don't worry the morning morning is coming also amen and God has beg to separate light from darkness and and what does it mean God has beg to separate the light from the darkness pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of the new day and he says down farther you are not of the world Little Children You are of heaven and this is not your home so we're in the world but not of it and mean in Solomon's day brother Brandon would talk about he had such a gift of discernment that the people would come and flock to him and the people would come and they prospered in wealth and riches and and they would never lose a battle they were prospering and brother brandom said it could have been a golden age for them it could have been a golden age or or even it was a golden age in that hour but he would talk about even in our day that we could have had that same thing that we could be living in a golden age and even America where where we're from because brother Brandon came from America and he said if they would have received his gift if they would have accepted his ministry then America could be in a golden age but the world rejected it but there is a people that Reed this message and though the world is in darkness though Leo DEA is going into darkness there is a bride who is living in a golden age there is a bride who is not in darkness but she's reflecting the true sunlight the very same Ministry that Jesus had when he left the Earth is coming back into a bride body don't you know in Hebrews 11 it said that they without us canot be made perfect what's it going to take friends to bring them from the graves it's going to take the very same Ministry that Jesus had when he was here on the Earth would have to come back into a bride body to produce the very same life recognize who you are you're more than just a the son of your parents naturally but you're a son and a daughter of God bringing forth the very same Ministry the very same life that was in Jesus Christ amen don't ever underestimate the power of what's inside of your life amen and brother BR said the spirit of God moved upon the face face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness he said I believe we're living in that hour again when God is separating light for Darkness he said we're not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of the day there's something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that we've looked forward to the press and coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking Over The Horizon's horizontal realm it's breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from an EarthBound nness and troubled world into a bright shining day as of an immortal life and an immortal body and Immortal Earth that shall never pass away it's shalom onto the church it's the light time coming for the Believers but a gross Darkness for the people brother Burley this is what you've been looking for for years and years and years We're Not Looking Backward we're not looking to turn around but we're looking to press towards the breaking of the day we're looking to press into the light it's a pressure because the darkness is being separated from the light that's what you feel this great pressure of darkness in this age and you look at the news and you you look all around you and you just feel the pressure of Darkness but what is it it's pushing out the light it's the breaking of the day it's the coming forth of the fullness of the word of a bride manifested fully that'll be here on this Earth and take a Rapture she'll fulfill the word that was spoken over her amen the darkness is gathering to show the light How can there be Darkness and Light it's got to be separated and only one thing separates it the word manifested separates it presses it to the other side but he said when the manifested word of God the son which it was spoken into existence by the word shows itself Darkness runs to the other side and that's what's taking place now Darkness separating itself from the light and and further down he said it's the going between It's always darkest just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day because the light is pressing the darkness but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning shalom shalom to the elected lady Shalom to the bride Shalom to those that are walking in the light amen for Paul said you were sometimes Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light Shalom to those who have the word down in their heart Shalom to those who have received that light amen we have light to walk in amen just laying down this word from from the message shalom in these different areas brother and now we can see in Psalms that it says Thy word is the lamp unto my feet and the light unto my path and we read last night about that day star shining down that Vindicated word lighting our path that we could walk in it amen and brother brandom said we'll just cut right to the point here about this message that we believe he said to my precious dear brothers and sisters to all of you as a servant of God I never said this before in the world in this church I never said but as a prophet of the Lord I say to you this is the light walk ye in it we're not looking for another light we're not looking to a partial light but we've already received our light and you can walk in it amen and when when the word is manifested it becomes light when the word is Vindicated it becomes light but this message is already Vindicated so brother you can walk in it you can walk down through the channels you can walk down through the messages and it's light onto you brother and and and one of the prayers of my heart is that I want to take my family I say Lord walk me through this message Lord every day I just want to walk with you through this message and you're walking in well-lighted paths because the word has been uh already Vindicated and you can walk in it and you don't have to be scared to walk in in Mark 11 you don't have to be scared to walk in Mark 16 you don't have to be scared to walk in the third pole you don't have to be scared to walk in the Rapture because it's already been Vindicated and you can walk in it because the light has already Shone upon your path and mean you don't have to be worried uh about walking in this word because it's already been Vindicated ated amen and there's light on it and there's no light outside of the word of God Amen all man-made lights will fa and and and we have beautiful lights in this building but one day if it would go on long enough they would they would go out they wouldn't last there would be a time where they began and a time where they ended but brother brandom said the first light that was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word and he said the only light that we have today in the church is God vindicating his light to this generation amen and all man-made lights are going to go out but there's a spoken word light that's going to last and if you walk in that spoken word light it's going to last and and if God spoke you as a a as one of his thoughts and as one of his seeds and brother you're going to last because you weren't just lit by man-made lights but you were lit by the light of God and it's a spoken word light and it's going to last it's not just going to uh uh be dim one day and bright the next day but it's a light that never goes goes out it's the spoken word light and every word that he promised will be will be Vindicated brother B said everyone every word that he promised will be Vindicated amen and that's why we preach the way that we do Amen brother Burley that's why we can stand here and declare unto you that the Lord is going to come because it may be tomorrow it may be a year from now it may be 5 years from now I don't know when he's going to come but I can declare unto you that he's going to come because every word will come to light every word has to come to light and so I can tell you that brother it's going to come the Rapture is going to come the resurrection is going to come and I don't have to know when it's going to come but I know that every word in this Bible will come to life will come to full Vindication will come to full manifestation and so you can trust it and walk in it until it comes to light and every seed of God will come to light every seed of God will have to come to light and we're living in a great light because because when when God spoke in Genesis let there be light it was one wonderful but it was only speaking of light that would bring botney life it it would bring the botney to life and the plants would begin to shine but in this this Resurrection in this day in this sun rising it's a dual sunrising but the sunrising that we've witnessed under this message didn't just bring botney life to life but it brought you to life it brought those Jee seeds that were laying in the earth to life and it resurrected you and showed you that you can have eternal life that you came from God and you're going back to God you possess an eternal equal equality I mean that's what this that's what this this light did it it's a greater light than that dawn of creation light that was spoken in Genesis because it brought you to eternal life amen more than just the grass out on the fields amen it's a light that we can rest in it's a light and you say it looks awful dark but brother man said no matter how dark it gets you can't see your hand before you just remember there is a man here that can turn on the light he said who'll Rapture that church he's talking about how that church won't go through the tribulation he talking about how they won't go through the persecution he said no matter how dark it gets every word will come to light so just hold on and there's a man that can turn on the light and there's still a man here tonight that can turn on the light no matter how long you've walked in darkness no matter how long you've walked in unbelief there's a man in this building that can turn on the light and it'll dissolve all doubts about this message it will dissolve all doubts about your identity because there is still a man here that can turn on the life and he can make this word come to life in your being in your personal walk he can turn on the light and you won't be walking in confusion anymore but you'll be walking in Clarity oh it's a man that can turn on the light amen he's still here and when every promise is fulfilled when death is swallowed up in Victory Jesus will come and the last one will be Vindicated then there will come an eternal peace upon the Earth an eternal Shalom an eternal shalom peace will rest upon the Earth amen he can do nothing until this Bride Comes hither I can do nothing till you come hither but when that last one is Vindicated there's coming an eternal Shalom when that last seed when that last word when that last thought that was expressed comes to light there's going to be an eternal Shalom and we'll enter into an eternal Shalom amen Watchmen what of the night brother brandom told us of the darkness and of the light amen he told us of of of of the seven visions of this world and the Judgment that was coming he told us of all these things but but he says when we see these fearful sides coming earthquakes tidal ways Falling Away gross Darkness heady high-m minded lovers of pleasure now that's all for the world that's what the world is pointed to he said but the church has another sign he said that blessed called out sign he promised that there would be a latter rain in the church the church spiritual in the last days he'd pour out both former and latter rain remember former rain came first latter rain came second both former and latter rain in the same season he promised it so you see the promise to this world isn't the same promis to you but we've got other promises we've got a promise of a former and latter Reign being poured out upon us we've got a promise uh of a word Revival in our day of a bride's Revival that we can enter into and enjoy and have a constant Revival though the world all around us is dying we've entered into a Revival into a rest in this hour we have promises we're not with without promises in this time of of judgment we're not without a refuge but Brotherman said uh he's a rock a mighty tower he's a shelter in the time of storm so he's our shelter the righteous run into the tower and our safe they're safe that's right he's on the home plate he's called safe
