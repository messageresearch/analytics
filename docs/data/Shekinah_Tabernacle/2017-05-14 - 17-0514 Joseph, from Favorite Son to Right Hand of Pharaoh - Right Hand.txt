I just said Lord your will be done and not mine so whatever door should close let it close whatever door should open you open it because usually I wanted the door to open so badly that I'll make it open you know because you you you just make it happen and and so there was three I was looking for a new job and it was three opportunities that came up and I shot two the three opportunities and I asked the Lord to to guide me and all of a sudden I have the fourth one coming in as well and and I just didn't feel good with it and so I prayed I said Lord you know your will be done so if you want me to go into this field I'll go into that field if you want me to go to the other one or if you want me to stay I'll stay but you must close the doors now and then he just started closing the doors and it is the one job to say that it's fine and the other one was pushing hard but because I didn't feel comfortable with it I say close it came to a place where I had to choose between two jobs in one day and I said lord please help me now and I went and I prayed and I was walking in a field in Belmont Park I think a walk and I just prayed I said Lord really your will be done because now I'm confused what goes Bo's need to answer me today and I need to give them answer back as well and I walked and long story short I went back to the Lord and I prayed and I went in the car and I emailed

bless you friends god bless you all great to have you all amen if you've got your Bibles handy we'll go to Hebrews chapter 12 I want to say happy Mother's Day as well I mean god bless all the mothers amen god bless you all you know brother Bram said if you break motherhood this how important the Prophet put motherhood he says if you break motherhood you're broken the nation right then he says he said motherhood is the backbone of the nation it's not the men it's the mothers so god bless real mothers amen god bless you all now let's so we've got a Hebrews 12 and 1 and then we're going to go to the book of Genesis and I want to continue on from from last week but in a different direction I am I had to stop my heart last week but I thought well I don't know how to put it all into one service so here we are so Hebrews 12 and 1 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and a set down at the right hand of God and now let's go to Genesis chapter 45 and we're going to go into the life of Joseph I'm here it's going to take the scripture ducks familiar to to you all about the about when his brothers come before him so Genesis 45 and one this is where Joseph reveals himself to his brethren says then Joseph could not refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with them while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph that's my brother father yet loved and his brethren cannot answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his brethren come come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I'm Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God had sent me before you to preserve life for these two years have the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be earring nor harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a prosperity in the earth and to save your lives by great deliverance and now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he has sent me hither and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all's house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt I met Lord blesses word you may have your seats now if I could take a title I want to I want to take a I'd like take Joseph so Joseph going from the favorite son to the right hand of Pharaoh now we read their last yah we your last Sunday we were talking about let us run and there's a race we must run and that race has been set up before us so the track that we're to run has been laid out before us and Paul's admonishing us let us run our race with patience and so now Joseph he had a race to run he did not know the path that was going to take him but he was so gripped by the two dreams he had about his family bowing down to him and be him becoming the head of the tribe that he that was he was fixated by that because God spoke to him in dreams this is what's going to happen but he didn't know how is going to end up that way right and so now it says and if we go to second Corinthians 13 because pulse is looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith so he monitors us let us run but you got to look unto the Lord Jesus the word in order to run so you can't look at your circumstances or what you may be going in the here-and-now you look under him because if you look under him he gives you the strength to run and what you look unto is what you become right so singing proteins 3 and 13 it says now just just going halfway through what Paul is speaking about but he says now and not as Moses which put a veil over his face the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain if the same vail untaken away in reading of the Old Testament which Vail has done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses read the Vail is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of Lord so Paula saying what you beholding we're beholding the you know the glory of the Lord and we have changed into that same image from glory to glory so there's a transformation as we walk with God he is changing us or transforming us from glory to glory until because one time we had a fallen we were made in the image of a fallen man but then God by his Spirit transforms us and he makes us into his image Alleluia and this word transformed is where we get the word metamorphosis from there the Greek word Metamorpho and we know a metamorphosis we think of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly it is a transformation it's the same life in the animal but it changes from one form to another form but also the minute the word metamorphosis from the British dictionary it's also a complete change of character or appearance so it's not just a physical way that something has changed its the character or the nature of the person amen so now they went God when you meet him he changes you from a fallen son of Adam and he changes it you are metamorph you are transformed amen you're not reformed or patched up you're transform that your nature and everything you are has changed Amen that we go from me you know let's just go there right now let's go to Genesis chapter one and three because Joseph now I'm just going to drop it in right now Joseph was the favorite son he would have been spoiled and we'll go I was going to be kind of giving an introduction and and and his family you know these family traits and his family there was a great thirst for revenge and we read about it where their only sister was was abused by someone in the land and how they got even as two other brothers wiped out every man in the city and took the woman and children captive that was them getting revenge that was in the family so that trait would have been in Joseph but God had to change him that when finally he had the ability to get the revenge on his brethren he didn't wipe them out anybody gave them life Aliyah is the same thing with you and I there's a position we're running to well then the position were it in but God has to change our character change our nature and order for us to really come into that position hallelujah that's why it's not just a mental assent of an idea God's got to take you you know when you really meet them you know you've met them because your life and nature's been changed amen it's not a hot surah maybe you know it's happened where once your brother Graham said he what you're those five young guys beat him up he's y'all get my gun I'll shoot them and he loaded his gun any fight he was it wouldn't go off they ran off he put it towards the tree and every all five shots went off that was unarmed he wanted to kill them he oh yeah a mint but then when he met God I look just like the guy who killed his favorite dog and enough and then he wanted to go kill that guy as well but his father stopped them but then after he met God he did that same one to Christ holy cause his character change Lord to God now let's go to Genesis let's read from Genesis 1 hey but now so this so we go so Joseph goes from spoil favorite son right hand of Pharaoh where where one place he would have wanted revenge and that but then he was transformed then he gave life and mercy but now Adam Adam takes the opposite step Adam goes from this is go to Genesis 1 and 26 and we know in Genesis 1 God makes man spirit man he's made in them as image God as a spirit and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so man created a God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them so he made man as spirit male female and spirit man one being and they had dominion over the earth rights and they were they lived out that dominion and then in Genesis chapter 2 when let's go to let's go to verse 7 this is in Genesis 2 when God he didn't create man he formed a body for man to go into and so in Genesis 2 and 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and we know after this God took the woman out of out of Adam and the Neels Adam and Eve right there but they were the same person masculine and feminine so Adam was made in the image of God so the character and nature of God was an atom member and and God was to be a redeemer and him was to be a guide and him was to be a have dominion you know all the attributes you see in christ yarn go you see you would have seen an atom because he has made in his image so when you saw how Adam conducted himself upon the earth that's how God would have been in flesh and has attitude towards anything would have been the same as God's attitude towards anything so they would have been exactly you know you would a you saw an image of God you would have seen it an atom and everything he did now so this is now so then the serpent comes along the devil uses the serpent as a vehicle to bring sin into the world now the scripture tells us that Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived in the transgression so Eve was was tricked into it she didn't understand what was your the magnitude of what was going on but then when when Adam came along and saw his wife had fallen he's a son of God he must redeem he must try and you know take her and lift her back into the place years once and because it's in him he can't help but he's in the nature of God he's made in the image of God and so he quickly the prophecy as quickly takes her to himself amen and does the same act the serpent did with her puts his life into her because God Adam knows as a son I'm part of God God can't lose a part of himself I mean because I made it as image I'm not a separate year I'm part of him I'm in his family lineage partly so he can't lose me so therefore he jumps in the breech puts his life into her because Adam knows if his life is in her God can't destroy his life well there's the same thing with you God puts his life into you amen and then therefore the God cannot destroy you hallelujah so he acts as a redeemer Alleluia because the scripture says in 1st Corinthians 6 know ye not that your that your bodies are members of Christ shall I take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot God for but what know you not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh he's tongue yo so Adam joined himself with his wife who was deceived into prostitution and to adultery but because he was his nature was to be a redeemer he quickly did it Amen because he was acting as Redeemers trying to stand between because he knew God he knew God would destroy her so he quickly stood in the priests to try and save her and he did it away but then in that fall Adam his nature changed when he fell right his nature changed because when we go to Genesis chapter three and eight notice notice Adams change of character Genesis 3 and eight so you know it says and they heard the voice of God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I had myself and he said who told thee that was naked has our eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee not to eat and the man said the woman which thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat so now what's happened he took before the fall he took responsibility I'm going to because it's in me to be a redeemer I'm going to try and redeem my wife I'm taking any because it says in the scripture by one man sin entered into the world shows Adam's choosing to follow the sly wife to let sin come into the world right but then now when God comes down to deal with what's just happened what does he do he he's basically blaming God for the reason he's in this situation this is the woman you gave me so basically he said he's saying I didn't ask for for Eve to come out of me I didn't ask to be put into a deep sleep I'm asked for this woman to come out of me this is not my fault this is your fault God amen he was actually blaming God the one who made him this is man and fallen state now he was blaming God for the predicament he found himself in hallelujah this is a man who has fallen he was blaming the one who made him it is your fault I remember man has free moral choice man has a choice but because he was in his fallen condition he would not take responsibility for his choice a meant he was saying that this whole predicament was because of God and God causes that's why people get angry at God how dare you God why should this happen to me but their choice and a lot of it causes them to go down that way a mint so yeah this this is characteristics of a fallen man they will always blame someone else for their predicament now there are some things in life such as a child has been abused they are always the victim they are never responsible right taking the extreme case but the one who does it to the child will blame the child yeah they will it's their fault they did whatever and they're innocent as can be they did they did way and it caused me to do it no they yielded themselves to a demon power and they gave their will to that demon power than they did the deed Amen but it's the same thing with us than anything else when we fall into sin we have to yield our will to because we're going to fall the nature will yield our will to that and then we'll go do whatever it is Amen because our our free moral choices governed by our nature right but then now people fall into all kinds of things and they say I'm the victim 99% of time no you chose to do it but if you never actually come to the acknowledgement I chose to do this sinful B then you'll never truly repent because you're just sitting back as the victim and if you just sit back at the victim you'll never be free I mean but if you take responsibility God can step on your behalf and because there's a land that's been slit as a blood that's been shed is a life that's been given to cleanse you of whatever course you need to go down that way amen because now well we have to understand certain points we are haunted by our past I mean it was not truly dealt with it haunts us Amen because the devil knows that there come this coming a time where destruction will come he knows there's a lake of fire with his name on it he's trying to drag everyone he can there as well amen so he knows there's a time of destruction but friends we're living in a very different hour because it is the same now I'm still talking about Joseph but you take the likes of Queen Esther Esther comes to her place it's the comforter positioners Queen and when she comes to her position as Queen and she goes before the king there comes a time where the rule records are opened because the king can't sleep the book becomes open now before the book comes open Haman has already signed into law by the Kings authority that is coming a day the 13th day of the 12th month or whatever it is that all the Jews will be destroyed and no doubt all the enemies of the Jews would have said have you read this have you read this I have legal right amen you're going to die and all your stuff is going to become mine amen and the Jews would have been haunted by this because he he would come here torment as their devils I'm going to get you it's a day closer it's another day closer your end is coming they will haunted amen but then when Esther came to a position the record the book became open Alleluia surely after she came before the king for mercy for her people the book came open right and then suddenly it changed from where where it was men doing the Jews were going to be destroyed on that day now the enemies of the Jews we're going to be destroyed on that day so it's the same thing today friends that God has appointed a day where it's not the enemy getting his revenge upon you but there is a feast of Purim hallelujah that you can rise up and destroy your enemy hallelujah and we are living versus the day amen where we are living in that day I'll loo you but well how do I destroy my enemy you got to bring it to God he's already been defeated on Calvary don't let him haunt you anymore hey the the orders been sent Holly the word has come through a prophet I mean that we're now living in a very different day or one day I can revenge myself no today we're living in a feast of Purim three hallelujah amen so you've got to but so don't hold on don't say I'm the victim get us actually my sinful nature made me do this amen and if you do that now God can you can truly repent and God can free of that haunting why be haunted by the devil we meant to haunt him I mean the tables have been turned Alleluia we are we are his you know we are his torment glory to God Alleluia so del we should we don't need to worry about anything this is no you got to don't let the enemy haunt you don't let him haunt you of your past put it under the blood amen the only way pueblos say Lord I my nature did this I chose he made the devil may have deceived you into it because that your this pleasure and sin for just a season right but you got to say ultimately Lord I agreed with him and I went down that way yeah Alleluia amen so rise up and kill your enemy now's the time hey man hey the stalemate the time of stalemate has come to an end right as total victory it's been given to the bride and we should not live below our privilege Amen at us remember you think about feast of Purim comes member it's in the Jews revenge we can oh we're going to eradicate them and they would have hunted down their enemy mm legal right and they would have butchered them whatever they did taking all their possessions they wouldn't have rested till the Sun went down on that day only had once one day to do it Olu you find your enemy amen hunt them down do it yeah hallelujah take back what belongs to you Amen just do it where we're living in the hour it must be done now this is looking unto Jesus so I'm going to Paul says let us run with patience the race it before us now look under Jesus the author and finisher of our faith now to look unto is to consider attentively to stare at a meant to discern clearly and then and then and in the Hebrew meaning is to experience right so to look under Jesus you can't just can't just be a casual glance right to run this race you've got to stare at him you got to behold him you had to experience him Amen you got to keep your focus upon him and because of you keep your focus upon him he will transform you from glory to glory amen remember Joseph had to run from favorite son to the right hand of Pharaoh right and it was his race his his race that that he was running made the transformation right so he had a lot of bad moments in his race but that was all God there was all the disappointment all the slavery all the false accusations all the imprisonment that was God he could say I'm being transformed hallelujah that was part of his transformation and so but he was so as us in the beginning he kept looking to those two dreams he believed that was going to happen he believed was going to happen now friends have you not been called have you not heard a prophetic message in this end time Elijah's come upon the earth to find a bride have you not heard it I mean I trusted become a living reality so just keep that why is he called you I'm going to make you the Queen of Heaven I'm going to put the enemy under your feet Amen you're going to be victorious in this life I mean in this life we're called to have a Dominion friend lujah and our Dominion is Christ's Dominion because we joint heirs with him so if that's the case there every part of our life is part of our transformation right good Ambe cat you can't lose I mean Joseph he could have been I'm a slave into Egypt hallelujah I've been falsely accused by part of his wife glory I'll because God knows what he's doing all ooh yeah I have disappointments along the way hallelujah I think it's all going well sell it all falls apart just like memory isn't part of his house everything part of her head was put into his hands maybe you're sinking surely now's the time right now now some because he was the captain of the guard now's the time and it all falls apart just like this I won't went wrong now nothing was going wrong nothing's going out of kilter it is God ordering your steps hallelujah but you got to keep looking unto Him now brother branham use this I mean brother Andy users quote on on Wednesday as brother Brown from being led of the Holy Spirit in 56 and he says the only thing I am is God's servant and by trying to keep try to bring you to Jesus Christ through a divine gift that was given to me then maybe then something can happen I trust it will will you believe you will so he's talking to a lady I believe you will too now the first thing the lady is suffering with a tremendous nervous condition she's just on the verge of a breakdown she feels like she's about to lose her mind the reason is because of a burden she's burdened about someone she has a burden on her heart who's got a burden this morning I mean and that person is her husband and the man has got something like a stroke or something that's bothered him and she's pulled around with him until it's caused her to have a breakdown that's the truth is that right if it has raised your hand you believe now all your heart look Satan is just you feel alright now see you feel better because as soon as you accepted it that feeling left you see it's gone now that's right you see you don't feel it now do you it's gone from you that's right raise up your hand if that's the if the weary feeling is left you see because I've seen it when it left see but that's just a shadow now it won't it can't hurt you it's the devil and he won't come to you no more you'll believe it you believe that you're standing by Jesus Christ now which is a supernatural being here that'll keep him away from you all the days of your life you're going out here happy and rejoicing and rejoice in the Lord you believe that then Heavenly Father I lay hands upon this little woman I say Satan you have lied to her and keep away from her in the name of Jesus Christ you're defeated and we adjure thee by the Living God to depart amen now go rejoicing lady be happy just as happy as you can be singing hymns and praising God you'll be all right amen you believe it lady thank you Jesus head of dark hands belief Amen is that right now notice he didn't say anything about the condition of her husband nothing was changed in that department so her circumstances whatever what's your spacing before she came to the meeting and what you're facing when she left were exactly the same but her joy and her peace was restored amen so so the nervous condition was gone amen and she could go rejoicing in victory I mean because many times in life God doesn't change the situation sometimes he does but sometimes he doesn't but first he wants you to overcome the situation for it that your faith will not waver based on what's around you but you can be victorious however things are going on and then God can act on your behalf because character remember is not a gift every program says character is not a gift amen character is a victory you understand so it's a victory then there has to be a battle a man if there's a battle there has been opposition and if there is a battle against an opposition you have to beat it amen there has to be a struggle you understand so it's not just given to you or here you go yeah God doesn't just push a button there you go you're made in my image everything's fight you have to overcome I mean Joseph knew he was going to be it was going to be the head of the tribe but he needed the character for that position is the same thing with the Bride of Christ we know we're cool we know reelected and then we know we're made being made Jamie God has an image of us in heaven amen and he sees what you're going to become and everyday you just walking through them and he's molding you transforming you you're growing from glory to glory he knows what your going to be a be in the end hallelujah but then that that character has to be molded and shaped into you earlier because it's a victory amen so now so she now had overcoming power over her situation and she can be happy she can be in the Lord in spite of what's going on and that to me is real overcoming faith I mean because of everything's going well it's very easy to say glory hallelujah I'm having a jubilee but it takes real character and faith that your world is falling apart and you still feel the same way hallelujah and that to me is a great victory Alleluia I mean brother BAM says in the message action having reaction to an action this is on the in the family altar we think we have it hard and sometimes Trials come I think of this woman in the wheelchair and these children where you out there with heart trouble maybe did in a week from now eat up with cancer it may look awful dark but if you'll just keep coming closer to God to find out his purpose it's the angels of God ready to rejoice for a victory that God wants to give sometimes it's in disguise Minh there as soon as perhaps sitting here and think what would I do if I die tonight what if this would be the last night I'm on the earth what then it may look dark may look like you're going to die maybe you're here to be playful for your sickness and you're still a sinner you get right with God first say why did I take this I've got children at home how do you know that might be angels wings beating together trying to get you close to God so you can be a real mother or dad to those kids it looks dark like it does to the little woman but if you just take God's promise now that whatever will let him come and drink from the waters of life the Fountains of life freely drink the water freely it's for whosoever will that might be that might have been put upon you you might have done that evil you may feel condemned into your heart you Christians now as I said a while ago because something iniquity lays in your heart maybe it happened for a purpose to get you closer to God right you look at why why is this happened right that happened to me my life has been different since I seen that I thought I was just living fine but I found out that let God raised his hand one time Satan's got me we're mortal and it's just and it's just a blessing in disguise mantilla preciate a more now to know that he's loving and willing to take us back so he's saying that all the hardship and things it's God's blessing in disguise meant because God is trying to gather you closer to himself hallelujah so you know one of my favorite quotes are brother Brown you just can't lose being a Christian Alleluia just can't lose every situation life is for your good amen he knows he knows we he wants to get you hallelujah and he will use whatever means a meant because he wants to get your attention because he has to get us out of these five senses of this world and live by sense of faith Amen sealer Joseph now Joseph could see he said yo-yo opening text he said it wasn't you that sent me down here is God I mean so he could look at the whole picture of the thing because now he was actually more spiritually minded it wasn't looking at the five senses and poor me I'm now slave and all this hardship no he knew God's God caused you to send me down here hallelujah as the same thing with David he's on the run from Epsilon you know and and shamea whatever his name is you know he's crippled up guys cursing him throwing mud and rocks at him and his bodyguards you know and what if David's bodyguard says you know will I let that head of that dog stay on him you know and David says no leave him alone God told him to do that you got to read it he says God told him to do that he could see the big picture because now here he comes in the great test how's it going to react to his enemy how is he going to react to his enemy right and so he could see beyond the big picture and we know what happens he comes back into power shemales at his feet cry for mercy Alleluia now let's go to let's go to Genesis 37 and to it's just read a bit now Joseph his brothers hated him he say well why are you talking about Joseph Joseph the type of Christ absolutely but you got to see yourself and you got to see yourself and Joseph Amen cos he had to be prepared to be the right hand of Pharaoh and we we have you know we have to overcome there's a there's a throne or a Dominion for you amen to them that overcomes the promise of this ace them and overcome they'll sit with me and my throne as I've sat down with my father in his throne and means that throne is a Dominion so now there's a throne for us there's a position for the overcomer right and so we have to be prepared to go into that place you know many times we read John 14 I go to prepare a place for you Jesus speaking you know of I go to prepare a place for you and if I do I'll come again receive you to myself the place is prepared but the people have to be prepared for that place and that's what this life was about now he is preparing you amen to rule and reign with him Alleluia so that's what he's doing now Genesis 37 2 says these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren in the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah has father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all of his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him so he was the he was obviously the favorite son and they all they couldn't even speak because oh you know just everyday get out of the tent and breakfast why they do they couldn't even speak peaceably with him they hated them that much this is God's doing it wasn't them this is God made them angry God made God made his brothers hate him right this is God's doing and so he went from that now until finally he had to be transform laboring this bar I want you to see it he had to go through metamorphosis amen to be the right hand of Pharaoh now let's go to Genesis 34 let's go back a bit because I want to show you the revenge like I mentioned it but this is a family trait and his family and we know family traits sometimes it's more extreme in other members than others but it's still there yeah right so we see here in Genesis 34 this is when Joseph I think he wasn't he wasn't very old and we'll read from 34 one down to seven and we're just going to go read the whole chapter he's going to skip through it because I just want you to see this and and Dino the daughter of Leah which she bare unto Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and when she Shem the son of a ham or the high white prince of the country saw her and took her and lay with her and defiled her and his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel and and she come i'm spake unto his father Hamor saying get me this damsel to wife and jacob heard that he defiled Dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and Jacob held his peace till they will come and home or the father of Shechem we now unto Jacob to commune with him and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in Israel and lying with Jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done now they had a right to be angry they had a right to be angry didn't they right they had a right but now let's see their revenge okay sister let's drop down to verse 13 and the sons of Jacob answered chicken and ham or has his father deceitfully and said because he had to file Dinah their sister and they said unto them we cannot do this thing which is giver in marriage to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were for that were a reproach unto us but in this will we consent to you if ye will be as we that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people but if you not hearken unto us to be circumcised then we'll take our daughter and we will be gone and their words please harm or end and and she come a harmless son and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had the light and Jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father so now he wants to know they all want to get religious to try and join up and make it right okay and then we go down to verse 24 and unto hammer and other Shechem his son hearkened all went out of the gate of his City and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of a city and it came to pass on the third day now this is them getting their revenge when they were saw that the two sons of Jacob Simon and Levi Dinah's brethren each men took his sword and came into this upon the city boldly and slew all the males and they slew hammer and chick him his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Chekhov's house and went out and the sons of Jacob came upon this land and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister and they took their sheep and their ox and their asses and all that was in the city and that was in the field and all their wealth and all their little ones and all their wives took they captive and spoiled them even all that was in the house well that's revenge that's a revenge isn't it now it doesn't you know he should never have done that to it to their sister sure but this is them saying we're going to get revenge not just on him the whole city I don't know how many people was but they killed all the males and took everyone else captive took all their goods now we're square that's in the family that kinda revenge's in the family now God had to take Joseph because that's in him yep that's in him he had to take Joseph and he had to take that out of him right now if you just look at things naturally you will always want revenge right if Joseph said no you actually caused me to come down here now is my chance I'm going to deal with you they all would have been wiped out I believe that's just me but because he could see God in the whole thing and so this is God's doing amen and God changed him in such a way that now instead of them because they came to him there's a famine there's nothing growing they came to him for life yeah we need grain otherwise we'll die he knew who they were he knew exactly who they were they didn't know who he was they came to the one that they hated and desperation to receive life to receive food amen and he was changed in such a way that he gave it freely because remember he gave them the grain and put their gold on the top of the sacks he gave it without manual price Amen his character had been changed him he's a perfect type of Christ the Prophet tells us so he was he's the life giver now he's in place at the right hand of Pharaoh holy just like our Lord Jesus he's at the right hand of the Majesty on high and that's not a right hand as in God as a right hand it's a place of power and authority and position hallelujah so here he was and because he was placed in that way he could give life even to those who hated him couldn't even speak peaceably to him that's how much he was changed hello friends God works through his body hello God works the life comes through the body Amen just like in the book of Acts the angel goes to Cornelius said that you're your prayers and your arms have come up before God you know the angel didn't preach eternal life to Him he said go get Peter because the life comes through the body and so he goes gets Peter God's dealing with Peter Peter comes to the Gentiles he preaches and as yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them they received life so it all works through the body of Christ life is given through the body amen but now if your character see there's the thing you're yet to have the right kind of character to give the life I meant to impart eternal life to others you got to have the character to do it you following me because Joseph if he had his first character he would just wiped out his brothers will throw them in prison whatever more make them pay I'll make you pay you'll be my slaves how long was I slaved you can have to live that out but his character has changed in such a way his life hallelujah he was changed amen his his character was no longer what he once was but he went through a metamorphosis amen - finally when he came into his position he could live it out hallelujah this was all done that life would be safe would be preserved amen now God has a power to transform right God has a power to transform the devil has the power to default okay and so now I'll just read this from God's power to transform now it had to be in that way because he made it that way and he made a channel that anything that stays in his channel and the line of his work it will bring forth exactly like His Word said it would do it could not move from there if it's channel just exactly right so with everything and the trust and his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest is speaking about Adam now and each one of those seeds had the power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desired to be that's what it must be because I've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself and it's potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I wanted to be God has never changed just the same today as he was then God has determined to do something he'll do it nothing's going to stop him he'll do it now after it's all so well and said in order God felt sure now that this would be all right and then when he did then came in the enemy I'm going to so God gave the power to transform I'm going to call this fellow with power not to create again he had power to deform Satan not transform but to deform now anything deformed is taking from its original state this something that's wrong with it they see it some years ago on patrol going up through the cornfields I would think over there was a limb that blowed off of a tree and it fell over on a stalk of corn and the stalk was trying its best to get up straight like it was supposed to be but it was deformed because that something had happened and the stick was laying over it then we find a wild creeper in the field which many of you men here maybe a woman from Kentucky the woman used the hoe they're like the same as the man get out in the field with a hoe they call the old gooseneck hoe chop the creepers out if you didn't get those creepers where the corn was in the row like this then that creeper would reach over grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself around it gradually so easy so slyly and you'd hardly tell what's wrapping it was wrapping finally get stronger and stronger and it pulls the corn till it's the form pulled itself against itself wraps it around its own vine deforming it from what it was to something else yet it's corn but it's deformed corn and we are still in the image of God but some are so deformed the sons of God that walk contrary to his word and to the way that he had us and provided us to walk sitting setting something the world twists us out of the way pulls us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted us in to be sons and daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters of God the deformer I know this seems rather strange to speak on this 2d form but that's what he was he deformed or perverted pervert means to be changed over made something different and deformers the same thing that has that's been brought over and deformed and made another way yet is still the same seed but it's deformed now we find out this deformer has also had the same amount of time to deform as God had to transform amen he planted the seed or never planted in the gun he had 6,000 years of deforming the seed of God the Word of God to deform it to make it something different the first time Eve listened to him and God herself just on one little phrase remember first Satan quoted the scripture just as clear as it can be God has said you shall not eat every tree of the garden see so Satan has had the power to deform right but God has the power to transform right and if he has it in you now if he has it in you you are the Bride of Christ not you will be but you are right as not if you will you know you may one day become you are right and David member ----n Joseph was to become the right hand of Pharaoh that was in him before his birth God saw him in that position right David and David it was a waste to be a king that's right David was yo so Samuel was told by God go to Jesse's house my king is in his house there's a little boy he's just shepherding sheep around this is a man made after you're after God's own heart yo God so thought highly this little shepherd boy I'm going to attribute me coming in the flesh after him as the son of David so here he was the potentials were in him if follow me everything to be King was in him everything that take full dominion of the land was in him remember when he came to the throne they subdued the whole land man I mean they took the whole possession when the king came to his throne so ennum was to be it but he needed the anointing from the Prophet right and then as they happen he went through a metamorphosis I mean from a shepherd boy to being on the throne of the you know house of Israel hallelujah but you see his metamorphosis just like Joseph he was on the run I mean here's a fugitive in his own land he had hardship Amen he was on the run from Saul it tried to kill him more than once you know his own son tried to throw him off the throne all kinds of enemies without and with him but what did he keeper for him remember we're two looked unto Jesus well he look unto anointed a vindicated prophet a proven prophet a word prophet took a horn of anointing oil poured the whole thing upon his head pulled out an anointing upon that sea hallelujah brought it to life it says from that day on the Spirit of God was with him and he kept that before him hallelujah God said I'm going to be Jehovah he said I'm going to be on the throne hallelu he looked unto that Amen he looked under that hallelujah it doesn't matter where he was on the run not on the run it's not the first time kids Christ I don't be prai's about it hallelujah everybody he looked under that me hello friends he didn't ever lead he didn't ever live 100 tapes to listen to you never but well maybe had some Scrolls benighted me he doesn't have what we have but he kept himself in such a way god you're gonna make me king Amy you're going to make me king he didn't know how it's going to happen maybe he thought could member he was the right hand of Saul maybe thought in his mind just like Joseph now's the time he wasn't ready yeah but then him was to be king and him was to be king of ready hallelujah so he was so that anointing brought the sea to life and he looked unto the promise looking unto Jesus I mean I mean looking under the kingship and then one day he's on the throne the crown was on his head hallelujah because he delighted himself in the Lord he encouraged himself in the Lord he didn't look at a circumstance when the times got tough he looked at him Amen when the times he didn't look at his circumstance he looked at the Lord he following me so it's the same thing with Joseph he had to do the same thing and it must be the same thing with us yeah yeah Amen we have it we are called to be made into his image now we have some musicians to come soon I'll just I just want to close with us now if that is the case we have to get our eyes off our circumstance yep as I said yesterday last Sunday it's irrelevant what you're going through yeah amen it doesn't matter member out this moment of light affliction right it is just a space of time it'll come to an end amen Joseph would have he would have known if he if he really believed that was God saying your whole all your brothers are going to bow down to you he would realize I'm a slave in Egypt this will come to an end I'm in prison this will come to me because that vision had to be fulfilled amen David knew he is going to be on the throne when he didn't know but it had to come to an end hallelujah so he wasn't you let's get our eyes turn your eyes what look under what don't look at your circumstance the devil bombard us look at this this is happening this who cares what's happening I feel this way I don't feel this way who cares how I feel oh I'm gonna take a rapture I'm not going to take a rabbit I don't know who cares what are you looking unto what are you looking unto you if you look under you you'll fall and you'll be disqualified from the race but if you look under Jesus aim it doesn't matter what people say I don't care what people say about me does it doesn't matter if it's from without all with it well I don't care what people's opinion e-mail tell you what I think I'm making you my image your love gift earlier programs said that we are Christ's love love gifts to Christ and he doesn't find happy as it gives budget gifts he doesn't go to the warehouse and buy the cheapest thing $2 shop I want to find a gift for my son I love my son hallelujah then this word comes why because your love gift he picks you up hallelujah washes you transforms you changes you so so if I'm his workmanship you know it would love to criticize I don't know that they don't do the haul of critics is never the own artist right but then at the artwork could speak back they could say I don't care what you say he's the one who made me right and it's the same thing with you and I who cares what other people say about you what's what you make you're saying about you what does he made you to me hallelujah who cares what people say look whipping we are going through a metamorphosis amen everyday life you're being transformed a member it depends what you're beholding because we have the power to transform the power to deform as present what are you looking unto Jesus to be transformed we should be so caught up we should be so just consume hallelujah well don't you want to do other things too I'm just caught up I'm obsessed I mean I'm obsessed with this but God becoming flesh and me that's what we should be obsessed with friends I mean because if you behold him you will become him if you behold the world you'll become the look at people that you know you see the people there made in a skater boy image or a bank or a goth or whatever image why cause they're beholding it and they're looking unto how do they act how what things are they say what things that they do and they become that thing Alleluia we don't want to just behold what are you beholding what are you looking unto me Amen do you say well I've got a lot of bad things going on in life he was David has has has might yo all of us people go because yo he flees into the desert says everyone who is destitute and you know down and afflicted whatever they give themselves under David made him a captain here the men who are with him through thick and thin there was a lot of thumb there's a lot of thumb that they had to go through then they come into Zig leg they come back to Zig leg they're there their base it's an it's in flames all their families had carried away is David now he doesn't say now I'm the victim amen he he takes his to take responsibility because where are we going from here these men are looking for leadership I mean because there's a vision that has to be fulfilled where are we going God and he encourages himself in the Lord they were going to stone him right have we ever has anyone been in that place amen but he what he encouraged himself in the Lord and the Lord said what to do amen it doesn't say how long he encouraged himself for I don't know but he did until God said now you move this way this way Alleluia and it must be the same thing with us don't worry about what you see forget about it forget about this five-set who cares who cares where the family is who cares how you feel how sick you are who well you are doesn't that's irrelevant I mean don't let it hinder your face at all all my friends will hate me who cares Amen all yo everything's goin sideways it doesn't matter doesn't matter how my family despises me they despise Joseph and it was all part of his transformation holy is why we should just count it all joy amen it says it says in Isaiah and I'll try and find it says thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts us in thee a mentor he will you will be kept in perfect peace amen if you keep it your mind stayed on him that's a promise of the word you just keep your mind stayed on him and you'll have perfect peace earlier we're not two we're not called to bring in into account as I said last Sunday Abraham didn't say well I can't do it Sarah can't have the baby forget about it it was a great experience look no his life was his whole life was governed by that one thing we're going to have the promised son there's a land we're going to the land we have in the promised son it says he staggered not at the promise of God this is under the blood of bulls and goats friends under the blood of bulls and goats he's taking other promise of God how much more now us we're summits vindication of God being real amen there's so much evidence of a land beyond the river I mean there's so much reality and we feel the Friends of God come down as word quicken to us why has it become a reality for the God saying there's a place I have prepared you a play parlor and I bring my spirit down to show to you you're going to that place Alleluia sought that is the case what do we got to worry about there's an eternal realm that's been made there's a place in that realm for us and he's calling you because he wants you to see that's you know we're not just to be this is not the end we don't just live threescore and ten and go and just disappear but we're being prepared for a place and if we are caught up and I've been I'm on my way we have some musicians to come if we are caught up I'm on my way to heavens fair land amen and he's calling me from that eternal place hallelujah what do we got to worry what if everything else you just not even be on our radar Alleluia well we've got burden struggles just to light yourself in him just encourage yourself at him and he will fight your battle how is this going to work out I don't know but I'd like myself a new Lord you will take care of me and you'll take care of that hallelujah if David could do this if David could encouraged himself in the Lord what would he would have said to him you've called me to become King you have delivered me from the mouth of a lion and a bear Goliath was in the same bracket I've been delivered from sword as armies amen you've kept me safe I went down to the Philistine lands and I was preserved Alleluia he could he could just allied himself God you brought me this way hallelujah and in as hard as Troy was on men wanted to start because they believed they believed he was coming into power but remember it wasn't the promise was to David it became personal to David they could see it in their lives because the anointing that came upon him came upon them when they take a spear kill 800 minha wherever they did it wasn't Hollywood friends I mean they literally did it one man taking a sword killing a hobo because that anointing came upon them they knew he was coming into power right but their faith forget to waver because their circumstances so they needed someone in charge you could look beyond the circumstance I mean that's why we must always look at beyond whatever is happening in life and look upon the promise God has given you amen if he promise you that you'll rule and reign with him amen whatever that path is to you and your transformation just just running just enjoy every step of the journey earlier because God wants to show himself amen does David look at David zyg leg yeah he overcame to me that was one of the biggest challenges of us of his life they know Epsilon raises up now sure maybe he should have been a bit of dad and should have dealt with the son sure but he had confidence that if God placed him upon the throne then when God's timing was right God would tell him now you get off the throne amen so he had confidence Epsilon raise up he has to run for his life sure but he knows he's going to go back it's just me because he had have confidence delivered him there he's he'll deliver him here the circumstances may be slightly different but it's just still the same the same God and we have to have the same assurance you have the same assurance if God helped me here doesn't matter namely every aspect of your life Amen if God helped me in this place will he not help you in this place a man of God if God delivered me from this you'll doesn't live to deliver me from us isn't that right when he does you just have to rest keep your mind on him amen and you'll have perfect peace Alleluia amen shall we stand Hey you stand this morning Amen hallelujah amen I'm daughters an awesome God Amen Alleluia well I just had
