[20:37] you,
[20:38] musicians. Amen. God bless everybody.
[20:40] You may all have your Oh, just while we
[20:42] stand, let's all turn to
[20:45] um uh John
[20:48] 10:30. So that is John 10:30. And my
[20:51] title for today is Jesus was both man
[20:56] and God. Amen. So he was more than a
[20:59] man. Amen. He was indeed God. Amen. So
[21:01] if we go here to
[21:04] John John 10:30 and it says here in John
[21:09] 10:30, it says, "I and my father are
[21:14] one." Amen. So I and my father are one.
[21:17] Amen. You may you may all have your
[21:20] seats. Amen. I mean I I had a great week
[21:23] this week. I thought I was going to be
[21:25] in the bush on um Friday and Saturday,
[21:28] but we had I I was blessed to be able to
[21:31] work. Amen. It's a good thing. And also
[21:34] while I was working, I actually um the
[21:36] dude doing the carpet was a fellow from
[21:37] Carpet Court, which is a contractor that
[21:40] we sort of work with. And um he was
[21:42] like, "Oh, I heard you've been
[21:43] outreaching to some of these fellows at
[21:45] Carpet Court a while back, and you know,
[21:46] I'm actually a Christian." And I was
[21:48] like, "Oh, wow. I didn't think you were
[21:49] a Christian, but he was." And
[21:51] um yeah, I that was quite nice you know
[21:54] I was because you know I was I was
[21:56] blessed to work but I was a little bit
[21:57] distraught that I wasn't in the bush but
[21:58] still I had a very wonderful Friday.
[22:01] Friday was the my third best day of my
[22:04] life. Um Saturday was my second and
[22:06] today is the first best day of my life.
[22:08] Amen. This is the best day. Amen. Cuz
[22:10] I'm a I'm a day closer to God.
[22:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So Amen.
[22:16] We're going to Yes. So Jesus was both
[22:18] man and God. Amen. And brother Brandham
[22:21] says here, he says, consider this who
[22:24] was the father of Jesus. Matthew 1:18
[22:27] says, "She was found with child of the
[22:30] Holy Ghost." But Jesus himself claimed
[22:32] that God was his father. God the Father
[22:36] and God the Holy Ghost, as we often
[22:38] express these terms, make the Father and
[22:40] the Spirit one. Indeed, they are. Or
[22:43] else Jesus had two fathers. Amen. But
[22:46] notice that Jesus said that he and his
[22:49] father were one. Amen. Not two. That
[22:52] makes one God. Amen. So there's not
[22:54] there's not multiple gods. Amen. It's
[22:56] Jesus was God almighty.
[22:58] Amen. And then if we go here to
[23:01] Acts 9 and
[23:04] 3:5 and this is this is Paul when he was
[23:08] journeying into Damascus. And um Paul
[23:11] says here, "And he journeyied, and he
[23:13] came near Damascus, and suddenly there
[23:15] shined round about him a light from
[23:18] heaven, and he fell to the earth, and
[23:21] heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul,
[23:24] Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And he
[23:26] said, "Who art thou, Lord?" And the Lord
[23:29] said, "I am Jesus, whom thou
[23:31] persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick
[23:33] against the
[23:34] pricks." Amen. So here we can see that
[23:38] that Jesus isn't in a um a body of
[23:41] flesh. He is in in the light. Amen. So
[23:44] he he was more than than just a man.
[23:47] Amen. Because he he is here in the
[23:49] light. He's not in a in a body of flesh.
[23:52] Amen. And brother Brandham says here
[23:55] um he says God is in his universe. God
[23:58] is in his word. God is in his son. Now
[24:01] let's see when he was here on earth. You
[24:04] say it was his son. Yes, sir. When he
[24:09] was on earth, he said he was God. He
[24:11] looked like God. He act like God. He
[24:13] healed like God. He died like God. He
[24:15] rose like God. He was God. Was God the
[24:19] Son. And we know that the Son is God
[24:22] manifested in in the flesh. Amen. So So
[24:25] he could redeem what what Adam what Adam
[24:28] had lost. Amen. And like like dad said,
[24:32] God is everywhere and God is God is
[24:35] everything. Amen. But but we see his
[24:37] word manifested in in different places.
[24:40] Amen. Cuz before he was the word, he he
[24:42] was a the thought. Amen. And he becomes
[24:46] tangible when he is manifested.
[24:48] Amen. So we can see God expressed in the
[24:51] flesh as as his son. Amen. And you know,
[24:56] I love how brother Brandham said that
[24:58] indeed there are there there's not no
[25:00] devils in the bush. So when I go into
[25:02] the bush, I just always feel God. Amen.
[25:06] And he is in his creation the same way
[25:10] he was in a body of flesh. Amen. So
[25:12] isn't that that quite like when you
[25:13] touch a tree in the bush, you're just a
[25:15] part of God. Amen. He is in his
[25:17] creation. I always find that so
[25:19] powerful. I love I just truly love that.
[25:23] Amen.
[25:25] And then I'll finish off that quote. And
[25:28] when God the Father came down and dwelt
[25:29] in the Son, Christ Jesus, and they in
[25:32] unity were
[25:33] one, that's what they was. That was God
[25:37] speaking. Amen. So So, so Jesus was was
[25:40] indeed God. He wasn't just a just a man.
[25:42] And you know, I trust we all know the
[25:44] story of that lady and she went to
[25:46] brother Brandham and she she said,
[25:47] "Brother Brandom, I can prove that Jesus
[25:50] was only a man." And he said, "Okay,
[25:53] prove it." And she said, "Um, because he
[25:56] wept when um Lazarus Lazarus died." And
[26:00] Brother Bram said, I believe he called
[26:02] that too shallow. They too shallow of an
[26:04] argument. And
[26:05] um uh he said indeed he did weep like a
[26:08] man, but then he rose Lazarus from the
[26:10] dead and that was God. Amen. And also
[26:13] when when Jesus went and fasted for 40
[26:17] days and nights and he was hungry like a
[26:20] man. And brother Brandham actually said
[26:21] he was looking through trees to find
[26:23] some food and stuff because he was just
[26:24] so hungry. And but then brother Brandham
[26:26] said, you know, when then he took the
[26:28] two loaves and five little fish and he
[26:30] fed 5,000 and and and that was God. I
[26:33] mean that that was much more than a man.
[26:36] And you know, he he was also a man when
[26:38] he he slept in the ship in the Sea of
[26:40] Galilee. And brother Brandham said it
[26:42] was so the waves are so big that he and
[26:45] but he was so tired that he just slept
[26:47] through the whole thing. But um and then
[26:50] he got up and he said, "Peace be still."
[26:52] And that was, you know, that that was
[26:54] God. That was that was much more than
[26:56] than a
[26:58] man.
[27:00] And now we come here to to our last
[27:04] quote. And this is just before this
[27:08] quote starts. This is about the the
[27:10] woman at the
[27:11] well and Jesus has just told her that
[27:14] she has five husbands and the one she is
[27:16] not one she is with is not her husband.
[27:18] Amen. So, and brother Brandham says here
[27:21] and that startled the
[27:23] woman. She knowed that couldn't be a
[27:26] man. Amen. Because he wasn't a man. He
[27:27] was more than a man. Amen. She knowed he
[27:30] was more than a man. Certainly he was
[27:31] more than a man. He was God. Amen. See
[27:34] this day when they want to make him a
[27:37] prophet, he was God of the prophets. I
[27:39] mean like like um Islam tries to do make
[27:42] him a prophet. Amen. But he he is God of
[27:44] all the prophets.
[27:46] Amen. He was God himself made flesh in a
[27:49] body his own creation that he built
[27:52] himself a tabernacle holy and he lived
[27:54] in it and he walked through it and he
[27:56] talked through it and he expressed
[27:58] himself through that body. Amen. Just
[28:01] like he expresses himself through his
[28:03] creation. Amen. That he might by that
[28:07] one body give it as a sacrifice that he
[28:10] might bring all of us to him as sons and
[28:13] daughters of God that the Holy Spirit
[28:15] can speak through us. Amen. And continue
[28:17] his work, God and his
[28:20] son. Amen. So, if we could have the have
[28:23] the musicians come
[28:26] up. Amen.
[28:29] Um, if we could all stand. Amen. And I'm
[28:32] just going to close the service in a
[28:34] word of prayer. But, um, if anyone if
[28:37] anyone has has a need, you know, you
[28:39] know, there are some things, you know, I
[28:41] didn't understand this until a little
[28:43] while ago. Like my whole life, I've been
[28:45] in church my whole life and I sort of
[28:46] never really you understand but you sort
[28:49] of you sort of don't. But, but now I
[28:51] fully understand it. Amen. And that was
[28:53] quite recent and I was probably Yeah, I
[28:55] was 21. Um, so you know, if we want this
[28:59] revelation, we want to understand these
[29:00] things, if you could just raise your
[29:01] hand to the Lord and just ask because
[29:03] the Lord will reveal himself and Amen.
[29:06] We'll just pray. Dear heavenly father,
[29:08] dear Lord Jesus, I thank you for this
[29:10] blessed time, oh Lord. And dear heavenly
[29:11] father, I pray that dear Lord, if anyone
[29:13] struggles with not understanding some of
[29:15] the things, dearly father, dear Lord,
[29:17] dear Lord, may they just know that
[29:19] you've opened it all up, dely.
[29:21] Dear Lord Jesus, that we can understand,
[29:23] fully grasp everything, de heavenly
[29:25] father, that you've granted unto us,
[29:26] dearly father. Dear Lord, I thank you
[29:28] for this, dear heavenly father. I thank
[29:29] you, dear Lord Jesus, that you're here
[29:31] and you you're dwelling in us, dearly
[29:33] father, and you're expressing yourself
[29:35] through us, dear Lord Jesus. Thank you
[29:37] for that, dearly father. And dear Lord,
[29:39] I just pray that you bless us, dear Lord
[29:40] Jesus. In Jesus Christ's name I pray.

[33:46] your heart.
[33:51] Amen. Let's just bow our heads this
[33:53] afternoon, Lord Jesus. We thank you,
[33:55] Lord, that we can gather again, Lord
[33:56] Jesus. And Lord, we thank you, Lord,
[33:58] that we can know, Lord Jesus, that the
[34:01] same Jesus that was the same God that
[34:03] was in Jesus, Lord, is the same God in
[34:05] us, Lord, is all the same person, Lord.
[34:07] We thank you for that, Lord. And Lord, I
[34:09] just commit this time into your hands,
[34:11] Lord. I'm insufficient, Lord. I just
[34:13] pray that you'll take over, Lord Jesus,
[34:14] and that you'll just have your way,
[34:15] Lord. We commit it into your hands in
[34:17] Jesus name.
[34:19] Amen. Amen. Uh let's just uh before you
[34:22] sit, grab our
[34:27] Bibles. And uh yeah, this afternoon, I
[34:29] want to speak on the pill of great
[34:31] price.
[34:33] Um, all right. We'll just start in
[34:36] Matthew
[34:41] 13:44. And uh, the Bible says here
[34:45] again, the kingdom of heaven is like
[34:47] unto a treasure hid in a field, the
[34:49] which when a man hath found, he hideth,
[34:52] and for joy thereof goeth, and sellth
[34:54] all that he hath, and buyth that field.
[34:57] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
[34:59] unto a merchant man seeking goodly
[35:01] pearls, who when he hath found one pearl
[35:03] of great price, went and sold all that
[35:05] he had, and bought it. And then you
[35:08] don't have to turn to it. We'll just
[35:10] we'll just read it.
[35:12] Um says here, "Whereby are given unto us
[35:15] exceeding great and precious promises,
[35:17] that by these you might be partakers of
[35:19] the divine nature, having escaped the
[35:22] corruption that's in the world through
[35:23] lust."
[35:25] And then lastly before we before we take
[35:28] your seats, uh, Matthew 6, it says here,
[35:31] "Lay not up for yourselves treasures
[35:33] upon earth, where moth and, uh, rust
[35:36] doth corrupt, and where thieves break
[35:38] through and steal. But lay up for
[35:40] yourselves treasures in heaven, where
[35:42] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
[35:45] where thieves do not break through or
[35:47] steal. For where your treasur is, there
[35:49] will your heart be also." Amen. You can
[35:51] have your seats.
[35:56] Okay. Well, I'll just start with this
[35:58] word
[35:59] value. Um, this is just um I think it's
[36:02] the Miriam Webster dictionary that gives
[36:04] these definitions. So, um the one I
[36:07] really want to look at is just where it
[36:09] says uh value the definition or value
[36:12] relative worth, utility or
[36:16] importance. So, there's obviously
[36:17] monetary value as well um and things
[36:20] like that. So if you buy something, how
[36:22] much that's worth in money and how much
[36:24] you're willing to pay for what you're
[36:26] getting. So it has to be uh in your
[36:30] eyes, it has to be valuable enough that
[36:33] you're willing to give your money for
[36:34] whatever it is.
[36:38] So all right. So and we obviously all
[36:41] have a perception of what is valuable.
[36:43] Like what I think is valuable, you might
[36:46] not think is valuable and vice versa.
[36:51] Um and uh and you know there's many
[36:55] things that we maybe pursue or we like
[36:57] to do it or we like to
[37:00] um uh have a uh ju just do it because it
[37:04] makes us happy or it makes us feel good.
[37:06] It might be for the ladies it might be
[37:08] shopping or whatever whatever they like.
[37:10] And for us for for the blo it might be
[37:12] like building or fishing or whatever the
[37:14] bloss like.
[37:15] So you know we all have a different
[37:17] perception of what is is value right
[37:19] like as human beings like there's it can
[37:21] be many things it can be it could be
[37:24] sports it could be um you know physical
[37:27] things you own it could be riches even
[37:30] your family and those things are
[37:32] valuable but they have you know varying
[37:34] degrees of
[37:36] value and
[37:40] uh yeah and you know the Lord made us a
[37:43] certain way so certain things make us
[37:45] happy and then we we we sort of crave
[37:47] that. I know for me and Dave it's both
[37:49] being in the bush like we both like
[37:50] that. It's uh and for some of these lads
[37:53] here it's might be support. I know you
[37:55] guys really into into that. What? So um
[37:59] but I want to ask this question. Um is
[38:02] our perception of what is valuable the
[38:04] same as the law's perception of what is
[38:07] valuable?
[38:09] So we'll just read this here. It says,
[38:13] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[38:15] neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth
[38:17] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[38:19] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[38:21] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[38:23] your
[38:27] thoughts." And uh here in Corinthians,
[38:29] it says, "But the natural man receiveth
[38:32] not the things of the spirit of God, for
[38:34] they are foolishness unto him, neither
[38:36] can he know them, because they are
[38:38] spiritually discerned. But he that is
[38:40] spiritual judgeth all things, yet he
[38:42] himself is not judged of no man. So you
[38:44] can see it says the natural man um
[38:47] receives not the spirit of God. Like our
[38:49] natural man is not inclined to receive
[38:52] the things of God. Um but because we're
[38:55] spiritual men and women um but we we we
[39:00] we can receive that.
[39:05] So, all right. And in Corinthians a bit
[39:08] further on, it says, "But God has chosen
[39:11] the foolish things of the world to
[39:13] confound the wise. And God hath chosen
[39:15] the weak things of the world to confound
[39:17] the things which are mighty, and base
[39:19] things of the world, and things which
[39:21] are despised hath God chosen. Yay. And
[39:24] things which are not to bring to not
[39:26] things that are."
[39:28] So you know even though a lot of the
[39:31] things we perceive as value as human
[39:32] beings um are not
[39:35] wrong um we are naturally as human
[39:38] beings inclined to place value on things
[39:40] which the Lord doesn't see as valuable
[39:43] as what we
[39:45] do. So um so let me ask you who is whose
[39:49] perspective is correct? Ours is human
[39:51] beings like me or you individually or
[39:53] God's perspective? Well, it's a bit of a
[39:55] no-brainer really because um God is the
[39:59] creator of the universe. He created this
[40:01] heart that likes certain things. He
[40:02] created your heart that likes certain
[40:04] things. He um he made us in a certain
[40:07] way to be motivated by something or feel
[40:10] happy by
[40:11] it. Um so I mean he made us so so I
[40:17] would definitely say that his
[40:18] perspective um is the right one. So um
[40:22] above what we might think is
[40:26] value and uh you know brother Bam says
[40:29] God wants you to be happy and that the
[40:32] human heart was made to be happy. So so
[40:34] it's it's good it's a good thing for us
[40:37] to be
[40:38] happy. So, you know, if if our natural
[40:41] inclination is not is not to perceive
[40:44] things as value the same as the Lord
[40:46] does, then may the Lord give us the mind
[40:48] of Christ to be able to see things from
[40:50] his perspective and what he considers as
[40:53] valuable. Amen.
[41:00] Uh it says here, "And be not conformed
[41:03] to this world, but be transformed by the
[41:05] renewing of your mind, that you may
[41:07] prove what is that good and acceptable
[41:09] and perfect will of God, and let this
[41:12] mind be in you, which was also in Christ
[41:18] Jesus." Yeah. So um so we have to put on
[41:21] the mind of Christ. So whatever we think
[41:23] is is is is what is value and important,
[41:25] let us put on the mind of Christ and and
[41:28] and take what he considers as valuable.
[41:30] The Bible says, sorry, brother Brandham
[41:32] says that the Bible reveals the mind of
[41:34] Christ. So if we want to know what the
[41:35] mind of Christ is, what does his word
[41:37] say? We've got to look into his
[41:42] word. All right, I'll just read this
[41:44] quote here from brother Brandham. Father
[41:46] God in heaven, this word, how it makes
[41:48] us free and sets us free. the waters of
[41:50] separation. It sets our thinking free.
[41:53] We don't no longer think with our own
[41:55] mind. We just depend on what he said in
[41:57] the word. Can't go wrong. God, uh you is
[42:01] the one who said it. You've separated
[42:03] it. And then if we're separated from our
[42:07] own thoughts, separated from our own
[42:08] ideas, we are lost then in you. And we
[42:12] just believe what you said. No matter
[42:14] how unreasonable it may seem, you are
[42:16] the God of circumstance. you are able to
[42:17] keep that what you have promised.
[42:22] Amen. And just another story that
[42:24] brother Brandon tells, a fellow said he
[42:27] went out into a pasture and caught a
[42:28] pony here the other day. He put around a
[42:31] ro he put the rope around the pony's
[42:33] neck, then made a half hitch across the
[42:35] muzzle of his face and was leading the
[42:37] pony back to the barn. Before he got
[42:39] there, the pony was leading him. That's
[42:42] what it is. So, you know, you caught the
[42:44] horse and the horse didn't want to be
[42:46] caught, but as soon as he was caught, he
[42:47] was so used to going to the barn and he
[42:48] just started leading the guy to the
[42:49] barn. Um, that's what it is. God catches
[42:53] us and we try to lead him. Let him lead.
[42:56] He knows the way. He has traveled the
[42:58] road. He made the road. We don't know
[43:00] the road. So why do we try to reason
[43:02] these things out? Let us just submit
[43:04] ourselves to him. Say, "Lord, you lead
[43:06] me. I'll follow."
[43:09] Amen. Amen. and he knows the way we
[43:13] don't. So, uh, now we're just going to
[43:16] look at some, um, um, examples of people
[43:19] in the Bible that, um, either chose
[43:21] God's perspective of value or their own
[43:23] perspective of what is
[43:25] valuable. So, uh, so you all can see who
[43:28] these two people are. There's the rich
[43:30] young ruler and then there's Moses in
[43:32] Egypt. So, uh, we'll talk about Moses
[43:34] first. He was um in quite a unique
[43:37] situation where he could he could choose
[43:40] to be the ruler of Egypt and have
[43:44] anything that money could buy, all the
[43:46] riches and power that he could ever
[43:47] want, or he could choose to be
[43:49] identified with the slaves and the
[43:52] mudbing people, which to the eyes like
[43:54] especially the eyes of the Egyptian was
[43:56] nothing, was probably um was probably
[43:59] lower than filth, you know, that in
[44:01] their eyes.
[44:03] And the Bible says that Moses chose
[44:05] rather to suffer affliction with the
[44:08] people of God than to enjoy the
[44:09] pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming
[44:12] their reproach of Christ greater riches
[44:14] than the treasures in Egypt. Amen. So
[44:17] that's that's the that's so Moses chose
[44:19] to put his perception of what is
[44:20] valuable aside, and he chose what God
[44:23] saw as valuable
[44:24] instead. And the rich young ruler, I
[44:27] mean, we all know the story. He um he
[44:29] was rich and and he had lots of you know
[44:32] earthly things and he he came to Jesus
[44:34] and asked him how
[44:36] um what he must do to be
[44:38] perfect and Jesus said well go sell your
[44:41] possessions give to the poor and follow
[44:42] me. I don't I don't necessarily think
[44:44] that the Lord asks that of us today like
[44:46] if someone's rich to do that but he knew
[44:49] what that man's that rich man's weakness
[44:51] was and what he would have to do to
[44:54] really sell out and he wasn't willing.
[44:56] The Bible says he went he was sad. The
[44:59] rich young ruler was sad at that saying
[45:01] and went away grieved for he had great
[45:03] possessions. And we know like brother
[45:06] Aaron says later on he died and he
[45:08] lifted up his eyes in hell. Um so he was
[45:10] not willing to let go of what he thought
[45:13] was value and and accept true value. You
[45:16] know um like we say at the beginning
[45:19] what we have is a pearl of great price.
[45:33] Yeah. So, um this pearl of great price
[45:35] that the Lord has offered us is
[45:37] obviously eternal life. Um, I mean
[45:40] that's one of the big things and not
[45:41] just that but to be able to walk close
[45:44] to him in this life and um walk in, you
[45:49] know, play our part in his kingdom in
[45:52] this life for each one of us. And if we
[45:56] can if we can if we can just perceive
[45:58] what a valuable thing it actually is,
[46:00] it's the most valuable thing there
[46:03] is. And you know, unfortunately, because
[46:06] it's so contrary to the vast
[46:09] um um majority of people, because it's
[46:13] so contrary to a human way of thinking,
[46:15] it's um they miss it completely. And and
[46:18] I mean, look how many people chase
[46:20] riches and this or that, but it's
[46:22] they're missing it. They're missing the
[46:24] point. Um so really thankful that the
[46:27] Lord has obviously revealed it to us.
[46:31] And this pearl of great price, you can't
[46:34] buy it because it's without money
[46:36] without price. You have to just accept
[46:37] it and believe
[46:39] [Music]
[46:40] it. Right? I'll just go down a little
[46:43] side road here. Um it says, "For he that
[46:46] sweth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[46:48] reap corruption, but he that seweth to
[46:50] the spirit shall of the spirit leap reap
[46:52] life everlasting. And let us not be
[46:54] weary and welloing, for in due season we
[46:56] shall reap if we faint not." So uh how
[47:00] can we not be wearing welloing
[47:03] um and not faint if we don't see the
[47:06] value in what we are
[47:08] um well doing if if we don't see the
[47:10] value in what we are um um aiming for
[47:13] you know um
[47:15] so so um yeah I mean like with
[47:20] anything anything in life it's you know
[47:23] the word of God is a seed and we have to
[47:25] keep watering it and keep um keep
[47:27] believing
[47:33] it. And um if we realize the value of
[47:35] the crop that we will that we will um
[47:38] reap at the end of it, we we won't
[47:39] faint. We will and you can apply that to
[47:41] anything where there is something you um
[47:43] um you a giant in your life. Like the
[47:46] giant might not be overcome at once, but
[47:49] we've got to keep watering that seed and
[47:51] believing.
[47:55] Um yeah. Um so just have a look
[48:00] here. Yeah. And um and obviously it's
[48:04] very basic but how do we water and keep
[48:07] believing like we we need to get into
[48:09] his presence um into the presence of
[48:11] God. Not just here at church but at home
[48:13] when we're alone. Uh um praying I think
[48:17] that's one thing some of us don't do
[48:19] enough including myself is praying.
[48:22] Um, you know, brother Arab says prayer
[48:24] is the most powerful weapon that was
[48:26] ever put in the control of human beings.
[48:28] There's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb
[48:30] as powerful as prayer. Prayer will
[48:32] change the mind of God. Did you know
[48:34] that?
[48:35] Amen. So,
[48:38] uh, yeah. Amen. So, let's water that
[48:41] seed with
[48:45] prayer. Okay. Um and I just want to take
[48:47] a moment and just speak of a few things
[48:50] that um are of value in the eyes of God.
[48:53] So uh we are very valuable in the eyes
[48:56] of God. We are of value in the eyes of
[48:58] God. Um it says in Isaiah, "For I am the
[49:01] Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
[49:04] thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
[49:07] Ethiopia and Sa for thee. Since thou was
[49:10] precious in my sight, thou has been
[49:12] honorable and I have loved thee.
[49:14] Therefore will I give men for thee." and
[49:16] people for their life. And this was he
[49:18] said this to natural Israel, but we are
[49:20] spiritual Israel. So I believe it
[49:22] applies to us as
[49:23] well. Um I will say to the north, give
[49:27] up and to the south, keep not back.
[49:29] Bring my sons from afar and my daughters
[49:31] from the ends of the earth. Even
[49:33] everyone that is called by my name, for
[49:35] I have created him for my glory. I have
[49:37] formed in him. Yay, I have made him. So
[49:41] I mean that that just shows us that we
[49:42] are valuable in his eyes.
[49:47] It says in Romans, who shall separate us
[49:49] from the love of Christ? Shall
[49:50] tribulation or distress or persecution
[49:52] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[49:54] sword? And a bit further down it says,
[49:57] for I am persuaded that ne neither death
[49:59] nor life nor angels, nor principalities,
[50:02] nor powers, nor things present, nor
[50:04] things to come, nor height, nor depth,
[50:06] nor any other creature shall be able to
[50:08] separate us from the love of God, which
[50:10] is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.
[50:15] So uh you know if if God values each one
[50:18] of us, each one of us bloodwashed sons
[50:20] and daughters so much, should we not
[50:22] have the same um should we not have the
[50:25] same attitude and view of each other as
[50:28] brothers and sisters? um and and love
[50:31] each other and
[50:42] Yeah. but as touching brotherly love ye
[50:45] need not that I write unto you, for you
[50:47] yourselves are taught of God to love one
[50:49] another.
[50:50] Amen. All right. Well, another thing
[50:53] that is of great value in the eyes of
[50:55] God is souls.
[51:00] Brother Barham tells a story how he went
[51:01] to a museum. So some time ago down in
[51:04] Tennessee, I was standing in a great
[51:05] museum and I was looking in the glass
[51:07] with some young fellows that was
[51:08] standing next to me and I was showing
[51:10] the chemical worth of 150 lb man. And it
[51:14] might surprise you to know how much
[51:16] you're really worth if you're in good
[51:18] health. A good strong man at 150 worth
[51:21] you're worth 84 cents. Well, you're not
[51:23] worth very much are you? just about
[51:26] enough whitewash to sprinkle a hen's
[51:27] nest, a little bit of calcium and so
[51:30] forth, all weighed up into 84 cents
[51:33] worth of chemicals in your body. Uh, one
[51:37] young at the museum, the one young
[51:39] fellow said to the other, he said,
[51:40] "John, we're not worth very much, are
[51:42] we?" I thought this was a grand
[51:44] opportunity. I laid my hands on each one
[51:46] of the boy's shoulders and I stepped
[51:47] between them and I said, "That's true,
[51:50] son. We're not worth very much in this
[51:51] body, but in that body's got a soul in
[51:54] it worth that is worth 10,000 worlds.
[51:57] But we want we want to take care of this
[51:59] 84 cents. We give it the best of
[52:01] clothes, feed it the best of foods, and
[52:03] put a $10 hat on it. And how we love to
[52:06] take care of this 84 cents and how we
[52:08] love to do things that we think is
[52:11] valuable because it because we enjoy it,
[52:13] but yet our soul is worth so much more.
[52:20] Sorry, a lot of reading this afternoon.
[52:22] But
[52:23] uh uh brother says, "I asked my wife not
[52:26] long ago. I said, I want to ask you
[52:27] something, honey. I said, what is real
[52:29] true
[52:31] um value placed on? I believe I told you
[52:34] that though the other night, what real
[52:35] true value? Nothing but lost souls is
[52:38] the only thing that's got any value in
[52:40] it. Money passes away. Homes decay and
[52:43] go away. Everything in the earth moves
[52:45] away. The only value lasting value I'd
[52:48] rather have one soul in glory that I
[52:50] want to Christ to know and see that the
[52:53] light of God circles around that soul
[52:55] through all eternity. My name to be
[52:58] associated with that than to have every
[53:00] penny of money in the whole earth cuz
[53:02] I'd have to lose it all. But what you
[53:06] send up there is eternal. Amen.
[53:11] Yeah. So, uh, if the Lord places such
[53:13] value on lost souls being saved, may he
[53:16] help us to live a salty life and not be
[53:19] scared to witness when we have an
[53:20] opportunity to witness to lost souls.
[53:23] The Bible says, "They that be wise shall
[53:25] shine as the brightness of the
[53:27] firmament, and they that turn many to
[53:29] righteousness as the stars forever and
[53:31] ever."
[53:32] And you know, I often think um uh this
[53:37] opp this what we have, this life that we
[53:39] have is an opportunity. Um as like Andy
[53:42] says, we should look around because
[53:44] we'll never see we'll never experience
[53:46] things as um quite the same as what we
[53:49] do right now on this earth. We won't and
[53:51] it's an opportunity and you know, we can
[53:53] we can invest in in in the life
[53:55] hereafter. And one of the ways is by,
[53:58] you know, just being a witness and
[53:59] allowing the Lord to to to use you to,
[54:02] um, to touch souls. May the Lord help
[54:05] us. Cuz I know for myself, um, I'd
[54:06] rather shy away than speak to people.
[54:09] But, um, I believe he can make us bold
[54:12] like they did like he did them on the
[54:13] day of Pentecost.
[54:21] Um, yeah. So, another thing that um is
[54:25] precious in our eyes, but sorry, in in
[54:28] God's eyes, but not necessarily in our
[54:30] eyes, unless we can see it, um for what
[54:33] it really is, is our trials and
[54:36] testings. So, it says uh Peter says that
[54:39] the trial of your faith being much more
[54:41] precious than of gold that perisheth,
[54:43] though it be tried with fire, might be
[54:45] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[54:47] the pairing of Jesus Christ. So it's
[54:49] much more precious to you than gold even
[54:52] though we don't always feel that way. Um
[54:56] and and obviously those things that we
[54:58] go for through there's a purpose and a
[55:00] reason for them and is it's to produce
[55:03] something of real value in
[55:06] us. And you know the devil tries to keep
[55:08] us preoccupied with what we think is is
[55:11] valuable.
[55:13] um he tries to keep us blind to what is
[55:14] real value
[55:17] um which is the purpose of God being
[55:19] fulfilled in our lives and you know God
[55:20] living through
[55:23] us and it's um it's like brother Ben
[55:27] preached the other day on spiritual
[55:28] amnesia if the devil can just keep you
[55:31] um if he can just keep you
[55:34] um tied up in your mind and not not
[55:41] um Yeah, if he if he can if he can just
[55:43] keep us, you know, in this little world
[55:45] where um I do this because I enjoy it
[55:48] and that's what I do, but actually just
[55:50] take a bigger perspective. Hey, why are
[55:51] we here? Um you know, what is what is
[55:54] actually valuable? What what actually
[55:55] should I be striving for? You know, may
[55:58] he just take that um amnesia, may the
[56:00] Lord take this amnesia off our eyes if
[56:02] any of us, you know, have some of that.
[56:06] And uh yeah, I just want to say, you
[56:08] know, we are the sons and daughters of
[56:10] God. We are the spiritual seed of
[56:12] Abraham and we have a promise to possess
[56:14] the gates of our enemies. And um yeah,
[56:17] may that just be made real to us. So uh
[56:21] I just as I close I just want to um one
[56:25] more
[56:26] thing. So uh just um from the angle
[56:30] again of your perspective and looking at
[56:32] things the right way. So, you know, when
[56:34] when Jesus died on the
[56:35] cross and um and yeah, and he was in the
[56:40] tomb, the disciples from their
[56:41] perspective, everything was lost. It was
[56:44] like everything we hope for and believe
[56:46] is is gone. What what is happening? But
[56:49] they weren't they they weren't aware
[56:50] that the greatest thing that happened in
[56:52] history was unfolding right around them.
[56:55] And it was yeah, it was all it was all
[56:59] because their perspective wasn't what it
[57:00] should be. And I believe on the road to
[57:01] Emmas um the Lord said, "Oh fools and
[57:04] slow of heart, um basically look at it
[57:07] from the right perspective."
[57:09] And uh yeah, so uh yeah, that's all I
[57:13] have for this afternoon. So if we can
[57:14] just bow our heads and
[57:16] pray and um I just want to pray that the
[57:20] Lord will help us to see things from the
[57:21] right perspective and help us to strive
[57:24] for that which is actually value, not
[57:26] what we think is value. Dear heavenly
[57:29] father, Lord, we just thank you, Lord,
[57:31] for for your word, Lord Jesus, and for
[57:34] the valuable gift that you gave us,
[57:35] Lord. That pearl of great price, Lord.
[57:37] It's like that man that sold everything
[57:39] he had to buy it. Um if we can just
[57:42] grasp what the the value of what we
[57:45] have, Lord Jesus, how valuable it is,
[57:47] Lord. We'd we' would put it at first in
[57:49] our lives, Lord. And we we just pray
[57:51] that you'll help us to see it for for
[57:53] what it is and just look at things from
[57:54] your perspective, heavenly father. And
[57:57] Lord, may we just lay aside every weight
[57:59] and press towards that mark, the prize
[58:03] of the high calling, Lord, and just lay
[58:05] aside everything that's not important.
[58:06] We just thank you, Lord, in Jesus name.
[58:08] Amen.
[58:09] All right, Mo, I don't know if you
[58:11] wanted to come and yeah, leave us in a
[58:13] few
[58:14] songs. Amen. God bless you.
[58:50] Amen. God bless you, Marian. Just sing a
[58:52] couple songs before I pull up for the
[58:59] Ben. Thank you.
[59:03] Let's just
[59:13] stand this thing touched by his
[59:23] fire. She's blinded all my darkness.

[59:35] passion to my

[59:45] night I am
[59:48] [Music]

[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:22] I want
[1:00:24] free. I'm going to take you by his
[1:00:29] [Applause]
[1:00:33] power.
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:37] He's
[1:00:39] all of
[1:00:41] my so
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:55] to
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:08] IP
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:22] shused.
[1:01:23] His holy
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:29] fire has changed my
[1:01:35] life inside of
[1:01:38] me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot
[1:01:43] give it. There's only hurting inside of
[1:01:48] me.
[1:01:50] I can
[1:01:52] only keep quiet this morning by inside
[1:01:58] of
[1:02:00] me. I've been touched by his fire. So
[1:02:05] let the world come and watch me
[1:02:11] burn. Shout it from the rooftops.
[1:02:16] Shout it
[1:02:17] till my
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:25] eyes. So let the world
[1:02:32] come sh from the
[1:02:35] rooftop
[1:02:39] sh I cannot hold inside. I cannot hold
[1:02:43] inside. I cannot keep it quiet cuz
[1:02:49] only inside of

[1:03:08] let the world come and wash me first.
[1:03:15] Shout it from the
[1:03:19] rooftops. Shout it to everyone.
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:24] [Applause]
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:28] [Applause]
[1:03:35] Lordise. Amen. We just heard God and
[1:03:38] flesh. Jesus was God and man. And then
[1:03:43] Marion spoke about
[1:03:45] value. The Lord, you think God became
[1:03:48] man. The greatest value, the greatest
[1:03:50] person to ever walk the face of the
[1:03:52] earth was him. Right? But yet he put
[1:03:56] your life at greater value than his own
[1:03:59] life. That's why he died and purchased
[1:04:01] your salvation on
[1:04:02] Calvary. Amen. Aren't you thankful Lord?
[1:04:06] Because many times we look at ourselves
[1:04:07] say Lord what values in me? But God
[1:04:10] says, "No, no, no. You have great value
[1:04:12] in you. That's why I purchased your
[1:04:14] redemption that day." Amen. I value you
[1:04:16] more than my He values himself. Right?
[1:04:18] So, praise the Lord. I enjoyed both
[1:04:20] those. Thank you so much. Amen. I was
[1:04:22] actually looking I don't need to preach
[1:04:23] on value anymore. I was looking at value
[1:04:25] because Judas valued the Lord at 30
[1:04:27] pieces of silver. That was the value he
[1:04:29] put on him. So, so he traded him, right?
[1:04:32] But may we never devalue the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:38] May his value, may his true value
[1:04:40] continue to be revealed to us as we walk
[1:04:43] with him. Praise the Lord. So, I enjoyed
[1:04:45] the youth service. Thank you so much.
[1:04:46] Thank you, brother Mo. Thank you,
[1:04:48] musicians. Appreciate it. Amen. So,
[1:04:49] let's um bow heads in a word of prayer.
[1:04:51] You got a couple of songs you want to
[1:04:52] lead us in. Amen. But praise the Lord.
[1:04:55] Amen. Gracious father, we thank you,
[1:04:57] Lord. Just to think, Lord, you the no
[1:05:00] one else like you, Lord Jesus. The
[1:05:02] greatest one that there ever will be,
[1:05:04] ever was, Lord. And yet you saw a joy
[1:05:07] set before you which was us redeemed,
[1:05:09] Lord. You put a greater value on our
[1:05:11] lives than you did your own. That's why
[1:05:13] you took our sins upon yourself and went
[1:05:15] to Calvary. Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[1:05:17] You fulfilled your own law, Lord Jesus,
[1:05:19] and redeemed us. You gave your life that
[1:05:22] we would live. And I pray, Father, may
[1:05:25] may we uh may you continue to reveal
[1:05:28] your value to us, Lord, as we behold
[1:05:30] you, the pearl of great price. Thank
[1:05:32] you, Lord. You put something in us, Lord
[1:05:34] Jesus, to see your value, Lord. Thank
[1:05:36] you, Father. Lord, that we gladly gave
[1:05:39] it all away. Gave this world away,
[1:05:41] opportunities away, Lord, that we would
[1:05:43] we would keep this pearl of great price.
[1:05:45] Keep you, Lord Jesus. And Father, as we
[1:05:47] hold your word, which you are, Lord, up
[1:05:49] to the light, Lord. And Lord, may we
[1:05:52] look at you and see how great you are.
[1:05:54] And Father, may you continue to reveal
[1:05:55] yourself. We love you so much. Thank
[1:05:57] you. You became a man to redeem us back
[1:05:59] to yourself. We love you, Lord. We just
[1:06:01] pray you dismiss us with your blessing
[1:06:02] now in Jesus Christ's name. Thank you
[1:06:04] for the service that we had tonight,
[1:06:05] Lord, this afternoon, Lord, in Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:06:10] you. Turn it to you,
[1:06:13] bro. Let's just sing one song and then
[1:06:16] we'll be
[1:06:22] dismissed. Sing our God is tremendous.
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:28] When I'm in
[1:06:30] need on the
[1:06:33] Lord and he helps me. Yes, he helps me.
[1:06:38] He is
[1:06:40] faithful and true. I forget his own.
[1:06:48] Oh, Michael
[1:06:51] Pine, my best friend, the only true God.
[1:06:56] There's no one greater, a wonderful
[1:07:01] savior. Jesus, the lion of
[1:07:06] Judah, our
[1:07:08] God. He made us, his strength never
[1:07:12] failing. You go through the fire used to
[1:07:17] save the
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:29] slight powerful I cannot handle. Our God
[1:07:35] is simplicity.
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:38] You and me came down from his glory and
[1:07:42] gave us the victory. The greatest of
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:52] story to see the rainforest.
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:05] We will stand for
[1:08:09] you for your future will come. Not the
[1:08:13] way that you think it should my
[1:08:17] Jehovah just paradox stand in your
[1:08:22] position and watch a
[1:08:25] miraculous come into action. I said our
[1:08:31] God is
[1:08:33] tremendous never fail. He'll conquer the
[1:08:37] fire just to
[1:08:40] save his
[1:08:43] almighty. He says his
[1:08:46] angels to
[1:08:51] me
[1:08:53] don't like I cannot handle. Our God is
[1:09:00] simplicity. You came down from his
[1:09:03] glory. He gave us the victory. The
[1:09:07] greatest of all came down from his
[1:09:14] glory. Gave us
[1:09:17] salvation. The greatest love
[1:09:23] story. Amen. Dismiss the name of the
