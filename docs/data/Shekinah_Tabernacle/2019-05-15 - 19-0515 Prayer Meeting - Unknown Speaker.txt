that the Lord would sleep over your soul this before brother in brings the word and leads us into free I just asked you know we've changed how we do pre meetings how we're praying all together I know you know for the little ones it can be seem a bit long but you know just if you could just be still talk to the Lord you know don't go out out and in and you know talk to him you're not too young for him to speak to you in an atmosphere like this so you know just just just be reverent and talk to the Lord and you'll find that the time doesn't take that long to go I mean so this just thing that just again just as brother it brings the brings the word and I'm under expectation you know we God as anything can happen God's here need to say where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the middle so he's praising here and you thankful he's not just in some place I mean [Music] [Music] probably see sites first time for everything yeah I am thank you for coming out thank you for being obedient to the heavenly vision and thank you that I can for you feminine the Lord's been good to me it's been good to us we should always expect more than a box yeah and we've got miracles so my thought today is the miracle before the miracle and I'll start off I have no idea how to start after England but I'll start with a definition the definition of miracle is an extraordinary and welcome event there is not explicit explainable by natural or scientific laws and therefore it's attributed to a divine agency the miracle of rising from the grave synonyms net supernatural phenomenon mystery prodigy sign and in quotes his first miracle was to turn water to wine this this comes from from the tree of knowledge of good and evil good old Google out thee so it's not like I've I've altered anything here so they had to quote it feels like they almost given up on that definition like we cannot explain this must be divine agency and I said praise to praise be to God I quickly better better search and the word miracles appear 27 times in in the Bible I have on my phone miracle appears 10 times in the Bible so remember those numbers that this is one us for free I I only got it this afternoon and yeah I was trying to hold it together anyway so weird all started so we were up in Auckland and we were having a wonderful time in the convention and and I think some of the constant constant conversation went around or good wholesome ones and then there was one concerning ones as in where is the miracles around us why can't well why are we not seeing miracles now today eyes I went quiet i sat back in it that I actually don't know how to answer that right here and and and explicitly but that gave that that brought the thoughts and I think that's the Lord just placed the seed so I sighs just started thinking about that and while we were doing our little convention on the other side of the world there was a youth meeting on and a youth camp and one of the sermons mercy walked in from of the Doni watered the seed and that mercy walked in and how Merkel's attached through that faith keep on walking that's all attached right and a while ago I wrote a song and clearly I'm not finished yet call don't miss your Messiah there's a bit of a miracle and and and witness and this Dominion that on its own but that made me think if you miss your Messiah you miss your daily miracle right so that's now where I want to head there's a sermon that the Prophet preached if God be with us then where is all the miracles I'll read you judges 6 verse 24 to 27 if you want to read with me judges 6 verse 24 to 27 and an Amen if you D sounds like majority vote then Gibeon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom very very very nice name God of peace God's peace unto this day it is yet in the Opera of the abyss she writes and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto Him take thy father's young Bullock even the second burlock of seven years old throw them down the altar of Baal that thy father hath and cuts down the grove that is by it and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock into the ordered place and take the second block and offer burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shall cut down then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city and he could not do it by day but he did it by night I will quickly and you can have your seats thank you very much I'll quickly I'll carry on and then I'll get back to that so in the sermon so I'll do a bit of reading here which just highlights where we are now what I'm reading here is as strong as zealous as passionate but this is what the Prophet brought us and this message I feel is for us here today that he spoke of in 1960 oh we living in a grand time immediately when the profit went off the scene what happened the Lord came on the scene as soon as John went off the scene the Lord came on the scene very strange our God works but he does it works in mysterious way that's the way the devil does so this is now just dropping another paragraph this that's the way the devil does it we get a little church started everything going well going fine how many preachers don't know this to be the truth just about the time everything is going right some old impostor will come right amongst that group and tear it to pieces that's right snatch the church right from a man if he can do that see that's the devil come in like grasshoppers and take take what's been given right so come like grasshoppers this is now where Gideon was surrounded basically and the angel of the Lord appeared and there was a and as he was saying and I think it comes down to that yet so I'll carry on and Gideon asked a question what a scriptural man that was that's the kind of man that God comes through somebody who knows Gideon said if God is with us if you are the messenger then where is the miracles that the Prophet told us about he knows he knew everywhere God went his miracles followed him he know that wherever God would be miracles would be I ask you now is God here tonight it's a simple law it's a promise it's given to us thus saith the Lord miracles are here I've had a terrible day today at work I'm here wife is lying Valentin vanities but there's sore throats and this just nothing everything in our house we're here right this is not me this is not the know Deus this is God and I'll carry on where's all the mighty miracles because we understand listen now scripture Gideon was in other words he said we understand that God is a great God of mighty workings he's a great God of miracles and if he is for us if he is with us if he is the same yesterday today and forever how where can I see his miracles it means it way I'm waiting I'm expecting there's a hope where is this where can I see this God in action where he's at if he is for us he's for us now that mighty men of valor could refer back to the old word and know what's right because he know that God is a supernatural being and wherever and supernatural being is he'll do supernatural signs because supernatural is in him you just can't get out of it how can you stand in the face of wind without being wind blowing how can you get in water without being wet water is wet that's a chemical it's wet yeah and when you get in water you're going to get wet expect a miracle tonight expected pray abundantly pray boldly pray with authority Lord's just given this to us out of grace and when you get into the presence of God the supernatural there's going to be a supernatural science and supranational workings of a supernatural God therefore he said where is the working where's the miracles if God be with us that's it glory see where God is miracles are we God is the sign of God is there okay a miracle before the miracle I'll refer this quickly okay I'll jump back I've said that miracle appears 27 times miracle appears 10 times in the Bible okay we read scripture that said take thy father's young Bullock even the second block of seven years okay drop down to verse 20 drop down to verse 27 then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him now they said there's quite a few pastors and preachers out there that love to take the numerology I'm Way too dumb for us but this jumped out to me I was saying Lord there must be significance in the in the amount brother James did the while back in his sermon and that I love that that kind of thing that kind of homework that they go and do but this just jumped out I said Lord but wake and I find this I was I was in the book of Acts looking at extant when he save and they're like whoa how can i that's me so that's flesh that's trying to put something together that might not be here I am looking and reading up on a sermon and I said oh I should just maybe catch up on the on the actual scripture and go to judges 6 hello come back to the wood come back to the wood right so let's okay so back to our my thought from our convention and the youth camp there were two preachers from the same country okay but kilometres on their case miles apart from each other so bro brother Andrew Glover flies 1260 kilometers to a youth camp in Louisiana do I say that right Louisiana brother David Siler flew to us to Oakland 13700 kilometers to New Zealand Louisiana is in Central Standard Time I think on the and New Zealand sits in New Zealand Standard Time 17 hours apart okay on Saturday morning twinny April I stand corrected but this is how I thought it was in that sermon on Saturday morning 20 April u.s. time rather Andrew delivers our powerful Burrell sermon which ends with the story of Lazarus Lazarus come forth and congregation the youth they went ballistic it was magnificent to behold and please go and listen to that on even evilly night tabernacle brew David brother David silo so on the same day on the other side of the world he delivers a powerful liberal sermon he was free he was he was expressing himself he didn't have focus and he refers to the same exact event yeah both of them exclamative that Jesus didn't walk over and whispered at the grave he didn't say to Mary and Martha turn away I just want to you know just give me a second he said Lazarus come forth okay and in in the same way it was delivered miles apart now I'm just going pulling in the right direction we're entering into the same Channel keep on walking in the middle of the road one thing that clearly I was I've skipped I was a bit too in my haste but I'll come maybe that's how I should end the Prophet also said if the weakest of Christians get on their knees hell shakes I'll tell you now back in 1999 I was one of the weakest Christians there was I was ironically in service year for Christ and we had different names for that it was just in some cases it was a joke right but at that point we had a youth camp there was about thousand four hundred kids on the grounds I've told someone that we had kitchen duty of two hours sessions he would just cut cabbage for two hours or it was stinking hot it was not good right there was a fire that erupted it was this this was in the war pops in the Western Cape Province I cannot remember for the life of me the campgrounds name hopefully maybe Lundy can but the fire came towards the ground and we know all the fire storm and wind and how it causes its own you know path and trajectory and everything and we as meek as weak Christians stood on the boundary and said god save these kids we're here for your glory we're not here for any anything and any of everyone else I wish I had a photo the fire stopped at the at the white fence that's it there was I was witness I gave that yes that's 1999 but like I mentioned just now recently there's miracles happening here these testimonies as I mentioned that's about now it is you are testifying you are witnessing you are living in this hour take the take the miracles it's yours live the promise the word is in you Christ is in you the hope of glory and like some ministers would go to shout glory hallelujah do you love the Lord this morning I want to say how much do you love the Lord tonight amen can we pray Lord Jesus Christ our blessed Redeemer the Rose of Sharon just a lovely fragrance that you come and and and spoil us with Lord bring your peace here tonight thank you that you can lead us into pray thank you and welcome Holy Ghost Holy Spirit to be here amongst us and in us that we can be here humble and and and and just in one Accord Lord we want to be that X Church again we want to have that liquor fire we want to feel that rush of a mighty wind through this building tonight Lord we believe that we can see miracles here tonight forgive us Lord for where we make mistakes and we fall short and we are in this flesh Lord we fight that every day but in Jesus Christ's name I want to ask you if you can be liberal among us Lord if you can supply us with our needs Lord if you can make a miracle happen here that can only refer to divine agency Lord we love our Creator Lord and we love it that you can come and sit and be an individual garden next to each and each one of us you are outside of time and space and matter Lord so that you can provide to us everything we do not need to be short on everything Lord and I just want to be humbled here I want to glorify your name I want to come and speak to you Lord and hear my heart and surrender Lord everything I have like brother Donny said I want to really surrender my heart I don't want to come to this church because it's a tradition or a routine because I love my brethren and sister even so it is I want to come here because I have a surrendered heart oh Jesus see it Lord and discern it come as a tooth sharp two-edged sword Lord and just may we enter in tonight and give you everything give you all the glory have a wonderful time and fellowship Lord I want to ask that everyone pray now together may they enter in may they may they ask the creator of this universe to supply your needs tonight
