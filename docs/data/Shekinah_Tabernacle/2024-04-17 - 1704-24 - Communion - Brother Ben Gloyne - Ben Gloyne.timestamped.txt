[25:39] amen God bless you friends you can have
[25:40] your seats tonight I just want to you
[25:42] know it's it's it's it's odd uh well I
[25:45] found this odd this is me in my little
[25:47] thinking but where the Lord would say do
[25:51] this in rembrance of me isn't it strange
[25:54] when he was talking to his 12 disciples
[25:56] he was talking to the the apostles that
[25:59] would take the gospel that would go to
[26:01] Pentecost would be filled with the
[26:03] spirit of God they would be they would
[26:05] uh F fulfill the prophecy of Joel of
[26:07] pouring you know God would pour out a
[26:09] spirit out upon All Flesh and the God
[26:11] that was with them would would would
[26:12] then come into them but then the Lord
[26:14] would say do this to remember me isn't
[26:16] that a strange thing really you know you
[26:18] think how could they ever forget if God
[26:21] is in them if God is changed them and
[26:23] God had called them out of many dark
[26:24] places like he has us he's taken us from
[26:26] many different walks of life many
[26:28] different situations and he's and he's
[26:30] brought us out of you know a lot of dark
[26:31] places but just like he did them but
[26:34] then he says do this in remembrance of
[26:36] me I think it's very important we never
[26:38] forget what the Lord has done for us you
[26:40] know not not just the fact that he's
[26:42] done it but the power that's contained
[26:43] in it amen that you know we understand
[26:46] that that what you know by by by his
[26:48] sacrifice that day on Calvary he he
[26:50] didn't just patch us up he didn't just
[26:52] cover our sin amen he took our sins far
[26:54] away as we well we haven't sung it
[26:56] recently but living he loved me dying he
[26:58] saved me buried he carried my sins far
[27:00] away am amen Rising he justified me
[27:03] freely forever one day is coming oh
[27:05] glorious day so there's great power
[27:07] there's tremendous power you think about
[27:09] where we were born lost we were all born
[27:11] lost not one of us were born saved not
[27:14] one of us were born a saint we were all
[27:16] lost we all needed salvation and we were
[27:18] on our way to hell but yet the Lord
[27:21] Jesus and his great love and mercy and
[27:23] compassion amen interrupted the devil's
[27:26] plan amen took over over our lives when
[27:28] we surrendered to him he saved us he
[27:31] called us he found us he saved us he's
[27:33] done an incredible work and he hasn't
[27:35] left us he hasn't left us half done amen
[27:38] he's going to finish the work he started
[27:40] and you know it's incredible when he'd
[27:42] say but but do this in remembrance of me
[27:44] I think if we could keep the the the
[27:47] uttermost focus on what he done I think
[27:49] it would revolutionize Our Lives I think
[27:52] it would keep everything in perspective
[27:54] I think it really would I mean you
[27:55] people you know there's always uh you
[27:57] know in the Med and different things
[27:59] there's always things are are Amplified
[28:01] or or or you know hyperbolized or
[28:04] however you say it you know to to to try
[28:06] and get people's attention and the devil
[28:08] loves to do that with trials and
[28:10] suffering and hardship he loves to make
[28:11] them look bigger than they really are
[28:13] and we know without God in the equation
[28:15] we're without hope but with him you know
[28:16] all things can happen and and you know
[28:18] he can do all things and we understand
[28:20] with him in the equation it's all
[28:22] working together for our
[28:24] good God is working amen he is He is
[28:27] wanting to reveal tell himself there's
[28:29] nothing in life that was is without
[28:31] purpose for a child of God I mean
[28:33] everything is for a purpose and it's for
[28:36] him he wants to work out he wants to
[28:38] work everything for our good amen so I
[28:41] think you know if we just keep really
[28:43] that that that um I wouldn't say even a
[28:46] thought but the reality of it you know
[28:49] the you know this may be quite simple
[28:51] tonight but I think if we could just
[28:52] really think Lord you found
[28:54] me I was lost and you found me
[28:58] amen I needed salvation and you saved me
[29:01] amen I've been sick but you've healed me
[29:03] amen I needed guidance and you guided me
[29:05] I I felt troubled and you comforted me
[29:08] amen you know everything he's done and
[29:10] you know I think if we just can can can
[29:12] keep that on the Forefront of our hearts
[29:15] when we're talking with people amen that
[29:17] should be on our hearts the Lord is my
[29:19] savior he's in control he can he can
[29:21] save anyone amen there's nothing too
[29:23] hard for God Amen things may look like
[29:25] things may look hopeless without him but
[29:27] if you include him amen everything's
[29:29] going to work out just fine you really
[29:31] think about if you've fully surrendered
[29:33] your life to the Lord Jesus Christ you
[29:35] can never have a bad day amen you'll
[29:37] have unexpected days y amen relative to
[29:40] other days you'll have good or bad days
[29:42] but in reality you'll never have a truly
[29:43] bad day because God has ordained your
[29:46] steps amen God knows what you need amen
[29:48] God knows the situations that he he will
[29:51] allow to come into your life for him to
[29:52] prove himself in those situations amen
[29:54] he wants to prove his word in your life
[29:56] amen and how else can he do it but allow
[29:59] the devil to come in and try and try and
[30:01] attack you but but he wants you to see
[30:04] that his salvation is more than enough
[30:06] amen his blood is not just a a little
[30:09] thing amen no it's complete salvation is
[30:13] of the Lord he's done a complete work
[30:15] amen the blood of Jesus Christ is
[30:17] nothing can defeat it amen like brother
[30:20] Ram said about when he saw the vision of
[30:22] the boy in Finland and then he and then
[30:24] when he came to Finland he finally
[30:25] realized that he was stepping into that
[30:27] vision he said you could line every
[30:29] devil up in hell and they couldn't stop
[30:32] that boy coming from from the dead dead
[30:34] to life again amen as the same thing
[30:36] when we realize if we if we could look
[30:38] at like the world is falling apart we're
[30:41] at the end time we understand that but
[30:43] we're walking in the vision of the
[30:45] Resurrection we're walking in the vision
[30:47] of the Rapture we're living in a Rapture
[30:48] season and no devil in hell can stop it
[30:50] that's right amen and he died that our
[30:53] bodies would be changed amen he died
[30:55] that when we stand before him we are
[30:57] perfect we are sinless amen I don't
[31:00] believe one of us you know if you're
[31:01] really under the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:03] on that day there'll be no one who's
[31:05] ashamed hallelujah amen because you see
[31:07] the one who died for you you're standing
[31:09] in front of the one who called you
[31:10] you're standing in front of the one who
[31:11] loved you is you're standing in front of
[31:13] the one who wanted you there you're
[31:14] standing in front of Amen this it's
[31:16] going to be incredible moment amen it's
[31:18] going to be wonderful amen when you
[31:19] really see him amen so shall we love him
[31:21] even the Bible says yet without seeing
[31:23] him we love him see how is that even
[31:26] possible it doesn't make sense but when
[31:27] you really meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:29] you fall in love with him and the one
[31:31] you have loved since the day you've
[31:32] surrendered your life is the one you'll
[31:34] stand in front of and he won't say you
[31:37] never knew
[31:38] me he you'll never if you're really
[31:41] under the blood of Jesus Christ you
[31:42] really know him you won't be
[31:43] disappointed that day amen amen you
[31:46] cannot be disappointed that day he'll
[31:47] say Well done my good and faithful
[31:49] servant you may think man I'm a failure
[31:51] I've done nothing good but just to
[31:53] believe his word to take him at his word
[31:55] surrender your whole life to his word
[31:56] and let him live that's good faithful
[31:58] servant amen amen where because remember
[32:00] the drunk servant started to do things
[32:02] he wanted to do right but the faithful
[32:04] servant said no the Master's given me
[32:06] instructions and because I love him I'm
[32:08] going to let it live out of my life we
[32:10] have our bad days we have our good days
[32:12] but he says they're faithful hallelujah
[32:14] hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen so
[32:17] I'm looking forward to that
[32:19] day we're a day closer this world is
[32:22] falling apart well people have been
[32:24] saying that for decades well here we
[32:26] are slow motion train wreck but we're
[32:29] not in a slow motion train wreck no
[32:31] we're on the steps of Ascension going up
[32:32] into Glory but you've got to realize God
[32:35] has made you and I probably want to go
[32:37] into it on Sunday but he's made us Kings
[32:38] and Priests remember the first time
[32:41] communion was ever served was by by mesc
[32:43] to Abraham and Abraham was a king he had
[32:46] Dominion he was a priest he had
[32:48] fellowship with God Amen and he was a
[32:50] prophet the word came to him amen and
[32:52] God has made us all three things the
[32:54] word comes to you cuz you received him
[32:56] didn't you not amen he's made you a
[32:58] spiritual King you got dominion over the
[33:00] devil do you not amen dominion over the
[33:02] flesh dominion over self God gives you
[33:04] that Dominion amen and then he gives you
[33:05] what you're a priest you can enter into
[33:07] the fellowship of God and you can
[33:09] intercede for those who are without just
[33:13] like Abraham did remember you know you
[33:15] know the Angels were going down you know
[33:16] the Lord was going down into Sodom he
[33:18] sent two angels before him and what was
[33:19] Abraham doing standing in the office of
[33:21] a priest interceding for lot if you find
[33:24] 40 righteous will you destroy it and you
[33:26] know you know God keep bring the numbers
[33:28] down why because Abraham was standing as
[33:30] an intercessor amen and lot got called
[33:33] out because of Abraham standing in his
[33:35] position amen and it's the same thing
[33:36] with you and I there's power in the
[33:38] office God has placed you in because of
[33:40] Calvary he's placed you in an office
[33:42] because of his blood he's placed you in
[33:43] an office he's given you Authority amen
[33:45] so you must never ever diminish what God
[33:47] has made you you say am I worthy well he
[33:49] called you to the office so you're
[33:51] worthy amen he's made you worthy he's
[33:52] made you able amen so I think it's very
[33:56] uh tremendous that we can stand here
[33:57] this night and say thank you for your
[33:59] blood Lord because the power of your
[34:01] blood I have fellowship with you now God
[34:03] there's not some big golf there not some
[34:05] theology to try and you know know you
[34:07] but you you've revealed yourself to me
[34:09] you've changed my life you've cleansed
[34:11] me I'm sure if we had time we could all
[34:13] stand here and say something that was a
[34:15] besetting thing is now
[34:16] gone what is that the power of the blood
[34:19] amen before you a skeptic didn't even
[34:21] believe but now you're believer what is
[34:22] that the power of the blood amen there's
[34:24] a time when you took your life into your
[34:26] own hands but now you let him take get
[34:27] over what's that the power of the blood
[34:29] amen so so I'm sure we can all boast in
[34:31] the blood of Jesus Christ tonight but we
[34:33] should never ever let it become common
[34:36] amen I think that's one thing if we
[34:38] could have some themes in this you know
[34:39] as a body of Believers we cherish the
[34:42] blood what God has done for us the power
[34:45] of the Cross amen because it's not just
[34:46] something we glorify in and see no
[34:48] results no we see the power of it that's
[34:52] why we glorify in it right so we don't
[34:54] just get caught up with a historical
[34:55] fact no we're rejoicing in the benefits
[34:57] of it amen I'm a living beneficiary of
[35:00] Jesus going to Calvary amen I'm a living
[35:03] beneficiary of him going to hell in my
[35:05] place carrying my sins far away I'm a
[35:07] living beneficiary of him raising again
[35:10] amen and I'm sure we can all say yes we
[35:12] are living beneficiaries of it amen so I
[35:14] think that's why to me that's why you
[35:16] know the Lord said do this in
[35:17] remembrance of
[35:19] me of what I that the greatest week
[35:22] brother R said was the death bar
[35:24] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:25] the greatest week in history there's
[35:27] been some great weeks but that was the
[35:28] greatest week sir amen so let's just um
[35:32] let's just uh turn to uh 1 Corinthians
[35:36] um
[35:37] 11 and um brother Ed if you could bring
[35:40] the bring the um the bread and the wine
[35:44] up cuz you know I I probably say this
[35:47] every communion but I feel the same way
[35:48] every communion I'm so thankfully found
[35:51] me but I don't take it for granted I'm
[35:54] not afraid I'm going to lose my
[35:55] salvation that's done you say if you're
[35:58] if you're sealed in you're sealed to the
[36:00] day of your Redemption but I don't take
[36:02] it for granted I don't say oh yeah
[36:04] that's just some common thing yeah
[36:26] sure
[36:56] e e
[37:45] this cup is the New Testament in my
[37:47] blood this do ye as off as you drink it
[37:50] in remembrance of me for as
[37:56] often e
