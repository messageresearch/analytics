[37:31] we've got peace that passes all
[37:33] understanding and we've got testimony
[37:34] upon testimony of people that's in the
[37:36] workplace and that's just being
[37:38] themselves themselves as being the
[37:41] spiritual man and daughter that they are
[37:43] and they acknowledge that this there's a
[37:46] there's a higher being inside of them
[37:47] working
[37:49] taken over the soul
[37:50] and that's the one that's speaking and
[37:52] the people cannot fathom this why is

[37:57] there's times of turmoil and everything
[38:00] it's not going to get any better

[38:13] um
[38:15] i i am afrikaans and english is my
[38:18] second language and me and the lord had
[38:20] a bit of a tussle and saying how do i
[38:22] put this title lord do i say are you
[38:25] looking do i say do you see do it and
[38:28] you'll see what i said was
[38:30] do you look
[38:32] do you look and hopefully it will all
[38:34] come together
[38:37] let's read the first let's read saint
[38:38] john 20 from about
[38:41] verse
[38:42] 11
[38:45] but mary stand without
[38:47] attacker weeping as she whipped she
[38:50] stooped down and looked into this apoca
[38:54] and sea of two angels in white sitting
[38:56] the one at the head the other at the
[38:58] feet where the body of jesus had lain
[39:01] and they say unto her women
[39:03] why who was thou whip is thou
[39:06] she saith unto them because they have
[39:08] taken away my lord and they hear she's
[39:11] probably not speaking of angels of of
[39:14] people or the disciples or the apostles
[39:18] and i know not where they have laid him
[39:22] and when she had the safe
[39:24] uh she turned herself back and saw jesus
[39:27] standing and knew not it was jesus jesus
[39:30] saith unto a woman why we bestow whom
[39:33] with secrets thou
[39:34] she supposing him to be the gardener
[39:37] saying unto him sir if thou born
[39:40] hence
[39:41] let tell me where thou
[39:44] has laid him and i will take him away
[39:47] jesus saith unto her
[39:49] mary
[39:50] she turned around and saith unto him
[39:52] rabboni which is to say
[39:55] master
[39:57] may the reading of the word be blessed
[39:59] by our lord god almighty you might have
[40:01] your seats
[40:04] right hopefully this is not too
[40:07] there you go do you look
[40:11] um
[40:12] yes um that was that was the thought i
[40:15] got do you look and and because like i
[40:18] said i'm i'm a bit of a afrikaans
[40:20] thinker please don't hold that against
[40:22] me
[40:22] um
[40:24] it is basically what it comes down to
[40:26] what
[40:27] do do you look
[40:29] at your circumstances if i can start in
[40:31] that fashion do you look at
[40:34] at your god-given gift do you look
[40:37] towards where the trouble is coming from
[40:39] or do you look
[40:41] where are you looking
[40:42] where are you looking what are you
[40:44] looking at
[40:46] yeah now
[40:47] oh i played this in my mind and yeah
[40:50] please please just forgive me if it
[40:52] doesn't work out but i wanted to be a a
[40:54] little practical example
[40:57] can this go higher the crazy little
[41:00] maybe not that high
[41:04] it's wednesday night so we can be
[41:05] slightly more relaxed yes
[41:09] so
[41:10] mary comes in into the sepulcher into
[41:13] the tomb so that she stoops down she
[41:15] bows down and here's the angel sitting
[41:18] what were the angels talking about what
[41:20] would they think like
[41:22] that the one say to the other yes i
[41:25] actually really want to be out there
[41:26] jesus said we need to sit here
[41:28] and mary's gonna come in here like why
[41:30] would she come in here we told her jesus
[41:33] won't be here it's the third day
[41:36] it's past he's outside he's in the
[41:38] garden he's waiting she walks past him
[41:40] he goes
[41:42] here's mary
[41:43] what are you doing why are you weeping
[41:45] didn't you see him you know what was the
[41:47] conversation there between the angels
[41:49] saying
[41:51] i want to see mary's face on the outside
[41:53] i want to be there i don't want to sit
[41:55] here
[41:56] why did jesus say we need to sit here
[41:58] and now these angels are seeing the
[41:59] flesh just you know the natural just way
[42:02] looking look past now here comes mary
[42:05] out of the tomb
[42:06] and now this is important for me
[42:09] is
[42:10] and and this was a massive revelation
[42:12] for me probably almost here two years
[42:14] back when when brother ben read this
[42:18] and jesus just said mary
[42:20] and it turns back to her uh to to to to
[42:23] yeah to her to saying
[42:25] master rabboni
[42:27] so here she comes out of the and and she
[42:29] bumps into jesus and it's like oh sorry
[42:32] sorry apologies and walk but now she's
[42:34] all snot in tears because she's not
[42:36] seeing
[42:37] where she needs to look yeah you know
[42:39] she's not looking
[42:42] why why was she looking in the tomb why
[42:44] did she not
[42:45] believe the message of her l in due
[42:48] season right
[42:49] she should have had that revelation now
[42:51] he comes and
[42:53] he stops her now by the grace of god he
[42:56] will stop you where are you looking why
[42:59] are you looking there
[43:00] here am i amen and that's what i like
[43:02] about brother
[43:04] ryan's testimonial to say
[43:07] turn away
[43:09] to jesus
[43:10] this flesh this natural wants to go the
[43:12] opposite way
[43:14] so if you are on your way there you're
[43:16] gonna you're gonna get stuff in the way
[43:18] and you're gonna be you know
[43:20] ah the opposite think the opposite of
[43:23] this this flesh wants to go yeah
[43:26] there's things that's happening in the
[43:28] spiritual realm
[43:29] with with yeah just brothers and sisters
[43:32] in this congregation
[43:34] and i would sit in my natural and i go
[43:39] how did they
[43:40] get to that conclusion how why did they
[43:43] make that decision
[43:45] from a business from a personal from
[43:47] whatever
[43:48] but then i step back and i go but where
[43:51] am i looking i'm looking at what was i
[43:54] fed
[43:55] 39 years ago and for 39 years
[43:59] what was i fed in my traditions and
[44:01] cultures and denominations and all this
[44:02] kind of thing
[44:04] this is where you're supposed to look oh
[44:05] lord that's we so that's and and by the
[44:08] grace of god it was good i could i could
[44:10] speak to brother matthew a bit and um
[44:13] we had to have a clean cut
[44:15] so us coming from a denomination and all
[44:18] these views and all these peoples and
[44:20] interpretations and we have to have a
[44:22] clean cut
[44:24] and by the grace of god and by sister
[44:26] lundy's testimony she was seeking for
[44:29] that hunger seeking for that
[44:31] i've been baptized but something's not
[44:33] right something hasn't changed where's
[44:34] the new creation why am i not looking
[44:37] towards what this the holy living word
[44:41] is saying where i need to look why am i
[44:43] still not there
[44:47] but you were not correctly baptized so
[44:50] get yourself baptized get yourself
[44:53] married get in that marriage and be
[44:56] one with the maker the creator
[44:59] living breathing gospel that we have
[45:02] right in front of us
[45:05] oh yes mary at the tomb
[45:08] why
[45:09] why would you look into this
[45:12] old smelly tomb
[45:14] what what what what's your expectation
[45:17] what would you find in that too
[45:20] a tomb is for burial a tumor is for dead
[45:22] people okay
[45:24] looking at the sorry this is slightly
[45:27] segueing i don't even have it in my
[45:28] notes but the pyramids
[45:31] everyone's raving about the pyramid to
[45:32] build there it's a burial site for all
[45:34] these pharaohs and all that
[45:36] so why right in the middle of the
[45:39] pyramid they talk about enoch circle
[45:42] the egyptians talking about enoch circle
[45:46] and i want to tell you what are you
[45:48] looking where are they looking
[45:50] do they look at the right thing right
[45:53] they're seeing this pyramid and and
[45:55] again it's the egyptians it's pharaoh
[45:57] it's egypt it needs to it must be
[46:00] because no one could build that
[46:02] um brother lonnie uh sorry lonnie i've
[46:05] got lonnie that's coming brother donnie
[46:07] reagan has a has got a real good sermon
[46:11] around enoch the stonemason and i can
[46:14] highly highly recommend that
[46:16] but what were they looking at
[46:19] so
[46:21] a few quick examples
[46:23] and and and i want to say
[46:28] let's take a team sport again so here i
[46:31] was standing in the you know we're gonna
[46:33] run out now onto the field and there's
[46:35] the other team and i'm here and uh my
[46:37] captain is motivating us and saying come
[46:39] on boys you can do it we can win this
[46:42] and
[46:42] i'm standing there
[46:45] this guy's seven foot
[46:47] how long am i going to tackle him
[46:49] no and there's my circumstances yeah i'm
[46:52] not seeing maybe he's a fat or blob
[46:55] i'm just seeing this tall how am i gonna
[46:58] tackle them you're not thinking maybe
[46:59] you can run around and maybe you've got
[47:02] the energy to outlast in your 80mm or 90
[47:05] minutes and you you you've got fitness
[47:08] you've got endurance you can run that
[47:10] race keep your eyes on the prize little
[47:13] ones
[47:14] eyes on the price the price that was
[47:17] paid
[47:18] and eyes on the prize where are we going
[47:21] yep
[47:22] all right
[47:24] just imagine noah building the ark
[47:28] okay
[47:29] we know all the story of noah building
[47:31] the ark but
[47:33] the lord says there's gonna be rain
[47:36] whoa whoa whoa whoa rain lord
[47:39] what is rain lord how am i going to
[47:42] explain this to the people
[47:45] where's this rain coming from
[47:47] what clouds what is so imagine the
[47:50] complexity of his situation in his time
[47:54] but he was not looking there
[47:56] he got that promise by faith and said
[47:59] there we need to we need to get over
[48:01] this
[48:02] we're going to get through this it's
[48:04] going to take a bit of a while
[48:06] and he just stood fastly built that ark
[48:09] because there was a promise so where was
[48:11] he looking do you look do you look
[48:13] towards that
[48:15] look towards your theophany
[48:18] and that's what i want to say mary you
[48:19] know
[48:20] sometimes
[48:22] if you're looking at that tomb sorry i'm
[48:23] taking back you're looking at the tomb
[48:25] and you bump into this
[48:27] if you are focused
[48:29] on your tomb right on your
[48:33] on your old nature
[48:35] focused on that and it's getting closer
[48:37] i'll get to that now maybe jumping ahead
[48:40] but focusing there and all of a sudden
[48:42] oh oh sorry sorry sorry
[48:44] that could be your theophany you're
[48:45] bumping against like the prophet saying
[48:47] now you're missing it
[48:49] and now you can't step into that one one
[48:51] tier higher that one level higher that
[48:53] one step closer to you being the perfect
[48:57] statue of a man
[48:58] right
[48:59] moses in the desert for how long how
[49:02] long did he tread
[49:04] and he knew a promise where was he
[49:06] looking at the desert at the sandals at
[49:08] the the clothes that's gonna
[49:11] there was a promise amen it was made at
[49:13] the saith
[49:14] walk that light walk that way
[49:17] where do you look there was a light
[49:19] there
[49:20] for them to look at
[49:22] so what causes us not to look or what
[49:25] causes us not to look away
[49:27] to jesus i like that sort of a play
[49:30] there i don't know what you call that in
[49:31] english but look a way to just almost
[49:33] sounds like the opposite to what you're
[49:35] actually supposed to but you have to do
[49:36] this look away
[49:39] but look towards jesus i like that
[49:41] i like that
[49:42] please do that
[49:45] examples all right
[49:48] so in my in my old life
[49:50] i would sit in the malls
[49:52] and i
[49:53] did not like malls so don't worry i was
[49:56] already converted back then from malls i
[49:58] do not like shopping sorry
[50:01] my wife knows this and bless the lord
[50:03] he's given me a wife that doesn't like
[50:05] shopping as well
[50:06] we get along swiftly so so well
[50:09] so
[50:11] i would sit there and stare at the
[50:12] people like the people just amazed me
[50:15] what were they
[50:17] what were they talking about oh that one
[50:19] is going to be in trouble when he gets
[50:20] home oh that one is going to get a box
[50:22] slow and they give you and they didn't
[50:23] get their lollies you know i would
[50:25] always watch that
[50:27] and brother and paul quickly touched on
[50:28] it
[50:30] the the people and what they wore in the
[50:33] malls is also that's a bit of a a mini
[50:35] fashion show as well going around there
[50:37] so if you in your in your right mind you
[50:40] would be
[50:41] looking at the ground
[50:43] you would not be looking at anyone out
[50:45] there because
[50:47] it's just absolute
[50:49] fulf right
[50:51] now the new me now i'm looking and and
[50:53] and the lord said sweat on your bowel
[50:56] you will be working i have to go to work
[50:58] i have to walk into the reserve bank i
[51:00] have to be wherever i have to be and
[51:02] along the way on the train wherever walk
[51:05] it's everywhere
[51:06] so like brother said i'm gonna bump my
[51:08] head if i just walk around like this and
[51:10] all but now when i see something or
[51:13] someone
[51:14] i look beyond
[51:17] what is that entrapment
[51:19] i'm looking
[51:20] there's a soul that's just
[51:23] missed what they were looking at what
[51:25] they were supposed to look at
[51:27] and she or he found
[51:29] the the the she they know the cause of
[51:32] it they they're still just looking at it
[51:34] because the natural manner will get
[51:36] there now
[51:37] is
[51:39] is easy the natural man is easy to slip
[51:42] back into
[51:43] so if you look away you need to walk
[51:46] away you need to you need to get away
[51:49] from that old you old nature all
[51:52] thinking right and thinking the opposite
[51:54] now i'm praying i'm saying lord touch
[51:57] that heart touch that soul
[51:59] where i am and where i'm standing i do
[52:02] not deserve this
[52:03] they
[52:04] they are
[52:05] in bondage
[52:07] free them yes i've got that sovereign
[52:09] grace now here with me they can have it
[52:13] please lord i don't know who's going
[52:14] into the rapture or not
[52:16] i need to sow the seed
[52:19] and like our watch tonight i said we can
[52:22] eat much we can we can we can drink too
[52:24] much we can do it but we can't pray
[52:26] enough
[52:27] so wherever you go watch your walk
[52:29] wherever the lord leads you we're
[52:32] looking you pray amen wherever you're
[52:34] looking pray
[52:38] your old nature so
[52:42] your old nature is always is is always
[52:45] still close behind you
[52:48] so let's go to that next slide
[52:51] um
[52:52] if you will so that was mary at the tomb
[52:56] crying
[52:58] definitely a heartfelt cry
[53:01] definitely in sorrow
[53:03] because
[53:05] now jesus is off the scene
[53:07] now the prophet's off the scene
[53:10] now
[53:11] we are walking alone are we sitting and
[53:14] are we moping are we crying
[53:16] or are we getting up and not looking
[53:18] into this and
[53:19] stooping down into the smelly tomb
[53:22] tomb but standing up and facing the
[53:25] other way so the other slide please do i
[53:28] have to click i actually do have the
[53:29] clicker sorry about that
[53:31] and i think it works
[53:34] if i switch it on
[53:37] there we go praise the lord
[53:40] she turned away to look towards jesus
[53:43] she looked up her redemption was nigh
[53:45] yeah amen why would you look into the
[53:47] tomb and look how close the two are to
[53:49] each other
[53:52] it is so close
[53:54] just just identify it just
[53:57] acknowledge in your heart the lord this
[54:00] old nature this old me the
[54:02] the way i'm turning or looking
[54:05] um
[54:06] may it be
[54:07] towards you the opposite of the what
[54:10] this
[54:11] old natural nature want to go
[54:17] so let's read this
[54:20] you must be born again that's the title
[54:22] of the sermon so in order if you're born
[54:24] again and got a new parent then you've
[54:26] got a new nature the old nature's dead
[54:29] and you've got a new nature you once was
[54:31] going one way now you're going another
[54:33] way and you once was going this way down
[54:36] and now you're going this way up praise
[54:38] the lord your affections are set on
[54:40] things on on above a new affection you
[54:42] don't love the things of the world no
[54:44] more your affections of god you don't
[54:47] care what means man says
[54:49] um how they laugh at you and say you old
[54:53] model or whatever it is like
[54:56] you don't care because you're born of
[54:58] above
[54:59] and do your affections are set on things
[55:01] above god's not ashamed of you and you
[55:03] not ashamed of him that's right
[55:08] so
[55:09] read the 11th verse
[55:10] 11th chapter of
[55:12] hebrews and i implore you to go and read
[55:15] that i read that again it is incredible
[55:19] by faith moses by faith abraham by faith
[55:23] it is all
[55:24] with that spiritual eye with that where
[55:27] are you looking do you look do you look
[55:29] where you should supposed to look
[55:31] look into the heavenlies look past your
[55:35] see your goal man
[55:37] eyes on that price yes
[55:39] um just our people in that day how they
[55:42] did and
[55:43] they wondered about the sheepskins and
[55:44] deserts and destitutes and everything
[55:46] else of whom the world's not even worthy
[55:50] of see read it it'll be good for you and
[55:52] you can see
[55:53] there what people when their nature has
[55:55] changed what happens they were stoned
[55:58] they were sawn asunder they tempted was
[56:00] slain with the sword they wondered about
[56:03] the sheepskins and goat skins being
[56:05] destitute afflicted tormented
[56:08] did they care
[56:10] did they care i'll read you there what
[56:12] was that verse 37
[56:19] they were stoned
[56:20] that's 37
[56:22] um 38 of whom the world was not worthy
[56:25] they wandered in deserts and mountains
[56:27] and in denzen caves and all and these
[56:29] all having obtained a good report
[56:32] through faith
[56:33] to receive not the promise god having
[56:35] provided some better thing for us that
[56:38] they without us should not be made
[56:40] perfect
[56:42] and
[56:43] guess what the next chapter of hebrews
[56:46] the title is running the christian race
[56:50] please i implore you go and read this
[56:52] and
[56:53] i'm preaching to myself much more than
[56:55] to you don't you worry
[56:58] okay
[57:00] so why
[57:02] now back to the young ones let's
[57:04] yep
[57:06] why
[57:07] do we
[57:08] want to
[57:09] place something in your heart and and
[57:12] make you understand
[57:15] that you need to build
[57:16] your character in jesus christ
[57:19] among
[57:20] believers i'm in this church
[57:23] in this fellowship not this fellowship
[57:26] anywhere where when people with
[57:28] like-minded faith comes together and
[57:30] they rub
[57:32] um
[57:33] proverbs 17 17.
[57:35] iron sharp is iron but we are sharp
[57:37] sharp irons if we sharp each other
[57:40] then we can cut right
[57:42] but we don't cut with malice we don't
[57:44] cut the stripe we don't cut with that
[57:47] all things in the past
[57:49] right
[57:50] love is corrective
[57:52] sometimes it hurts but that's good
[57:55] that's why we're saying to you young
[57:56] ones why do we want you to to come here
[58:01] expected plant your seed
[58:04] receive something here come with the
[58:06] expected heart lord i've got this big
[58:08] old hole in my heart just fill it fill
[58:10] it with your goodness fill it with your
[58:11] temperance meekness
[58:13] i need some love and suffering
[58:15] come here because now i'm saying to you
[58:19] if you come to a point and you are
[58:21] turning now let's turn the other way
[58:23] because i was saying that was towards
[58:25] jesus let's stand this way
[58:26] something is turning you towards this
[58:29] way
[58:30] but like i said now you were here
[58:33] you were praying you were fasting you
[58:35] were in the sunday school you were
[58:37] singing songs you were opening up your
[58:39] heart to be to receive
[58:42] and something or this this world
[58:44] something and and that circumstances
[58:47] changing your your way of seeing where
[58:50] are you looking do you look
[58:53] now
[58:54] if this is your old nature
[58:57] if your old nature is temperance and
[59:00] love and joy and peace
[59:05] now you are
[59:06] surrounded
[59:08] by the heavenlies you are surrounded by
[59:10] jesus
[59:11] so now when we as a parent and tell me
[59:14] trust me we fail parents fail we fail
[59:17] right we are in this fleet as much as
[59:19] you are right
[59:20] but if you come and you build your
[59:23] character in jesus christ
[59:25] character so your nature
[59:27] right yes you're born in sin shaped
[59:30] iniquity speak coming into the world
[59:31] speaking lies but now your old nature
[59:35] doesn't know anything
[59:37] bad per se your old nature is now all of
[59:40] a sudden um just queen is just just
[59:43] thirsting for something your old nature
[59:45] is now built on all these um
[59:49] love joy peace
[59:50] long suffering temperance meekness
[59:54] your old nature so what is your new
[59:56] nature gonna be that's where we want you
[59:58] to be that's when the quickening comes
[1:00:01] if your old nature is right behind you
[1:00:03] and i'll show you now
[1:00:05] even the prophet was
[1:00:07] had
[1:00:08] a tremendous old nature
[1:00:10] that he had to keep in front of that he
[1:00:13] hated uh one step ahead you know as they
[1:00:16] say
[1:00:17] and we've all got that but now to
[1:00:19] prevent you from trapping to prevent you
[1:00:22] from turning away to an old nature
[1:00:24] that's filthy that's dirty that doesn't
[1:00:27] have any substance and won't be able to
[1:00:29] lift you up
[1:00:30] if we can get you here to establish a
[1:00:33] character in jesus christ and this
[1:00:35] nature of old nature if i can call it
[1:00:38] that because you are 18 11 13 years old
[1:00:43] that old nature won't be that far off
[1:00:45] the track as your mum and your dad was
[1:00:49] now all of a sudden your old nature
[1:00:51] could be almost a foundation not that we
[1:00:53] turn away turn towards the old nature
[1:00:56] but you've got a safety net
[1:00:58] now you you are being enclosed you're
[1:01:00] being um
[1:01:02] i don't want to say trapped
[1:01:04] but you are surrounded you are

[1:01:46] my sons they don't need to have to go
[1:01:48] through what i've gone through
[1:01:50] we can have a a stone here a rock of
[1:01:53] revelation where they can get rooted
[1:01:56] so when they fall lord they know exactly
[1:01:59] what to do get up brother mathen said
[1:02:02] there's race that we're running he falls

[1:02:08] do not stop getting up get up
[1:02:12] run again you will fall
[1:02:14] repent from your remissions you will get
[1:02:17] up you will run again run this race how
[1:02:20] many times do you think have people fall
[1:02:23] just from this word
[1:02:24] we can talk about david we can talk
[1:02:26] about moses
[1:02:28] any of you murdered someone
[1:02:30] they've fallen they got up they ran the
[1:02:32] race
[1:02:33] do not stop getting up get up
[1:02:40] i'll quickly show you the
[1:02:42] the clip of brother lonnie it'll go
[1:02:45] um straight into it
[1:02:48] of the old character by old nature i
[1:02:50] quickly ran off a slide in the back room
[1:02:53] while ago
[1:02:54] and i don't think it's going to project
[1:02:56] it's a slide of this picture
[1:02:58] which was the seven licks of fire
[1:03:00] the supernatural picture taken in grass
[1:03:02] valley california
[1:03:04] and
[1:03:05] i don't think it's going to project what
[1:03:07] i want projected
[1:03:08] so i did a little ink addition on it
[1:03:12] right there
[1:03:14] and if you ever get this picture in your
[1:03:16] hand again you can look for that little
[1:03:18] picture there because it didn't show up
[1:03:20] on this transparency
[1:03:22] but
[1:03:23] i've told you before but i've never
[1:03:25] shown you the picture
[1:03:27] i was talking with brother sidney
[1:03:28] jackson one day prophet from south
[1:03:29] africa that was a close friend of
[1:03:32] brother branners and his brother he said
[1:03:33] brother branham took this picture
[1:03:36] and he says brother sydney he says look
[1:03:38] close behind me on the platform holding
[1:03:41] up this this
[1:03:42] picture and he says look closely behind
[1:03:45] me he says do you see that face that
[1:03:48] looks like an old indian chief or
[1:03:50] something
[1:03:51] and
[1:03:52] brother jackson says yes i see that said
[1:03:54] i've never noticed that there before he
[1:03:56] says that's my old nature
[1:04:00] he said it's always there to haunt you
[1:04:04] he says when
[1:04:06] he says when you receive christ and his
[1:04:10] word now i'm going to do my hands the
[1:04:12] way sydney did because it's very
[1:04:14] significant and he said that's the way
[1:04:16] brother branham did
[1:04:18] he says when you stand and receive the
[1:04:20] word for the hour the revelation of the
[1:04:22] hour
[1:04:23] he says that holy ghost fire comes down
[1:04:26] into your soul and he says burns out the
[1:04:29] old nature
[1:04:33] he didn't say a word but you got a
[1:04:35] picture
[1:04:37] it loses the position of dominion
[1:04:40] but it moves to a place of influence
[1:04:44] it cannot make you do anything
[1:04:47] but it'll talk to you as if it's in the
[1:04:50] same place that it always was
[1:04:52] but it has no power
[1:04:55] and he says that he says my old nature
[1:04:58] looks like an indian chief because he
[1:05:00] says because my mother was half indian
[1:05:05] now if that happened to a prophet
[1:05:07] that's what happens to every child of
[1:05:09] god
[1:05:11] the old nature is burned out of you and
[1:05:14] your new nature is god
[1:05:18] but the old nature is always there to
[1:05:22] hunt you
[1:05:23] it'll try to condemn you over the things
[1:05:26] that it did in your body
[1:05:30] are you following me
[1:05:32] so consequently that's why god says you
[1:05:36] are a
[1:05:38] new
[1:05:38] creature why because the control tower
[1:05:41] inside is brand new absolutely new and
[1:05:45] didn't do a thing against god
[1:05:48] and that's why you can stand justified
[1:05:50] before god as if you never did it
[1:05:53] because you the real you the
[1:05:55] predestinated soul from god you did not
[1:05:59] do it
[1:06:00] it was that
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:03] amen you can go back to that slice
[1:06:06] sistertalia
[1:06:08] um
[1:06:09] see if i can see
[1:06:11] there we go thank you
[1:06:14] it's amazing hey
[1:06:16] i mean old nature will always be there
[1:06:19] now
[1:06:22] god bless brother lanier that's that's
[1:06:24] that guy
[1:06:25] had a tremendous life his t stephanie as
[1:06:27] well
[1:06:28] um he's he's run a race and
[1:06:33] can't wait to see him and glory
[1:06:36] um
[1:06:39] how do we get away from this old nature
[1:06:41] this old nature that sit in its ways
[1:06:44] doesn't know any better just here behind
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:47] i've got a few things that maybe the the
[1:06:49] kids you could know
[1:06:51] this is now time for you to to sort of
[1:06:54] interact into okay
[1:06:59] what can you see there
[1:07:02] let's start with reuben
[1:07:04] what do you see
[1:07:09] do you know what car that is reuben
[1:07:11] the ferrari there you go you petrol head
[1:07:14] is he is he is he in the right place
[1:07:18] is is that is that is that a good place
[1:07:20] to be in
[1:07:21] it's not a good place to be and why not
[1:07:25] what's wrong with that
[1:07:26] picture where's lelia what's wrong with
[1:07:30] that picture
[1:07:34] okay is that called built for four by
[1:07:36] fouring do you think
[1:07:39] it's like brother albert's guy he's got
[1:07:41] like a mean big
[1:07:43] 4x4 it'll do slightly better than that
[1:07:46] guy
[1:07:47] right
[1:07:48] slightly
[1:07:49] so
[1:07:50] i'm also a bit of a petrol hit that's a
[1:07:52] rear-wheel drive car
[1:07:55] what will happen if we put big wheels on
[1:07:58] it will that then go
[1:07:59] will that help
[1:08:01] probably to a point maybe you'll get
[1:08:04] maybe five meters further right
[1:08:07] and that is where that's where the old
[1:08:11] nature will go now we'll get through
[1:08:12] this we'll get to it let's change
[1:08:14] something let's change the i'm set in my
[1:08:16] ways i don't understand i don't know
[1:08:19] anything better but maybe let's check
[1:08:22] new wheels let's check new wheels new
[1:08:24] wheels the car the suspension the power
[1:08:27] delivery everything it doesn't have
[1:08:29] four-wheel driving it'll get only that
[1:08:32] far and you'll fall again right
[1:08:36] so when when i read when i read this
[1:08:39] you'll be born again you have to be born
[1:08:41] again
[1:08:42] that um
[1:08:44] and please go and read the rest of or or
[1:08:47] listen to this
[1:08:48] sermon you must be born again because it
[1:08:50] breaks down the the
[1:08:52] beautifully the sanctification the
[1:08:54] justification the the the fire of the of
[1:08:58] the baptism of the holy ghost in your
[1:09:00] life that you need to be
[1:09:02] new you need to be renewed okay do you
[1:09:06] think
[1:09:07] this vehicle is built
[1:09:09] purposely built to go a bit further than
[1:09:13] this vehicle
[1:09:15] i think so
[1:09:16] so immediately we can see this big
[1:09:18] chunky tires it's higher off the ground
[1:09:21] it's obviously got four-wheel drive it's
[1:09:24] got a little winch there in the front
[1:09:26] right so there's a few things that this
[1:09:29] vehicle is equipped for its
[1:09:31] circumstances now if someone would tell
[1:09:34] you
[1:09:35] we will we will drop a pin in russia and
[1:09:39] um you can choose your vehicle you want
[1:09:41] you can choose your vehicle um to get
[1:09:44] from this point to
[1:09:46] let's say i don't know tibet or maybe
[1:09:48] moscow or somewhere do you gonna choose
[1:09:50] your ferrari or are you gonna choose a
[1:09:53] vehicle that may be able to handle a bit
[1:09:55] more terrain than you you don't expect
[1:09:59] you don't know you don't know what's
[1:10:00] coming
[1:10:01] lord but if i'm equipped
[1:10:04] if i'm in the right vehicle if i've got
[1:10:07] the new nature and i've dressed in it
[1:10:11] i can go a bit further than i think my
[1:10:13] old nature will be able to take me
[1:10:17] and in closing
[1:10:20] purpose built
[1:10:23] one that will get you to the end doesn't
[1:10:25] matter the terrain
[1:10:30] that picture
[1:10:32] is brother armand's truck
[1:10:35] that is on an angle quite a interesting
[1:10:38] angle
[1:10:39] no we didn't take the picture
[1:10:41] skew
[1:10:43] he's in a ditch and he's in trouble
[1:10:46] so he's he's got the new nature he's got
[1:10:48] the new vehicle he's got the new
[1:10:50] creation he's got the nice
[1:10:53] tires
[1:10:54] that's the thing there's gonna thingy
[1:10:55] hey
[1:10:56] um
[1:10:58] but
[1:10:59] if we go back one there's a winch
[1:11:02] and there's something that can pull them
[1:11:04] out
[1:11:05] right
[1:11:05] still need to be equipped so sometimes
[1:11:08] we jump into the river we jump into the
[1:11:10] mud and say we are new creation we we
[1:11:12] are fervent we are we are zealous we're
[1:11:15] going to make this work but now we we we
[1:11:17] we
[1:11:18] we need to get filled by the holy ghost
[1:11:20] before we jump into the mud right so
[1:11:23] more equip
[1:11:24] equip us a bit more right
[1:11:27] now this leads in and and you can have
[1:11:29] this for free i i only realized this
[1:11:32] while i was preparing here tonight is so
[1:11:34] there's our beloved friend mr chris
[1:11:37] eddie god bless mr chris
[1:11:39] um
[1:11:41] you will see there's a
[1:11:43] there's a where's the um little marker
[1:11:46] here
[1:11:47] is it that one here we go
[1:11:49] this this there's a
[1:11:51] cable a rope going this way and from his
[1:11:54] vehicle that is his winch
[1:11:57] here this way and it comes together here
[1:11:59] on a tree
[1:12:02] so we put that on a tree now
[1:12:05] month was quite stuck
[1:12:07] so we put it on a tree on the winch and
[1:12:10] now all the guys that know science and
[1:12:13] all that kind of thing you are doubling
[1:12:14] the force that you can now winch with
[1:12:17] the
[1:12:17] with the winch block what do you call
[1:12:19] that winch block
[1:12:21] pulley pulley something
[1:12:24] and physics and
[1:12:28] he will pull us out
[1:12:29] right so
[1:12:31] do you look
[1:12:32] we are standing and looking at our
[1:12:34] vehicle because it needs to move out
[1:12:37] towards this
[1:12:38] this way it needs to get out so we can
[1:12:41] continue on we actually just get to our
[1:12:43] wives because they are starting to be
[1:12:45] panicky
[1:12:48] and
[1:12:49] all our sites so i'm standing there on
[1:12:51] the on the left here on the
[1:12:53] on the little um
[1:12:55] uh step
[1:12:56] because it is sort of tipping over so
[1:12:59] i'm standing on here there's a little
[1:13:01] tree just here and we're leaning towards
[1:13:03] me and our josh and
[1:13:07] all our focus brother armand me josh
[1:13:11] chris he's focused we need to move
[1:13:13] forward so all our focus
[1:13:16] is to get um that little black speck
[1:13:19] there
[1:13:20] full of mitsubishi all right that's
[1:13:22] where we focused on so we're looking
[1:13:24] there
[1:13:25] and you hear this winch is crunching and
[1:13:28] cr moaning
[1:13:31] slowly progressing and we're like are we
[1:13:33] moving or are we not
[1:13:35] are we still looking
[1:13:37] and we turn around
[1:13:39] and his vehicle is starting to move
[1:13:41] forward towards the tree so he's
[1:13:44] winching himself towards the tree and
[1:13:47] we're not moving an inch so okay plan b
[1:13:50] plan b
[1:13:52] listen up closely plan b young ones
[1:13:55] not plan b is just the next step right
[1:13:59] the next step is the back of this
[1:14:01] vehicle
[1:14:03] we took another nine ton
[1:14:05] snatch strap
[1:14:07] or a
[1:14:08] toe strap
[1:14:09] around another tree
[1:14:11] now we anchoring it
[1:14:13] now we're anchoring it me and brother
[1:14:15] kibin we're fishing now two days ago
[1:14:17] we're fishing we're fishing and
[1:14:19] i only thought of it today but i'm
[1:14:21] thinking you know joshua jonathan
[1:14:23] the boys jaden they're going into the
[1:14:25] water and casting and we expecting to
[1:14:28] catch this big you know snapple or
[1:14:31] kawaii or maybe maybe a kingfish but if
[1:14:34] the kingfish starts to wrestle this
[1:14:36] little guy he will pull him into the
[1:14:37] water because where's he anchored where
[1:14:40] is he he's just in the water with this
[1:14:42] fish
[1:14:43] that is almost his size he will pull him
[1:14:45] under the water
[1:14:47] now we're anchoring this four by four
[1:14:50] onto another tree all of a sudden our
[1:14:53] focus is now look at the tree the car
[1:14:57] everything looks anchored the winch is
[1:14:59] still working okay turn
[1:15:01] turn away to jesus turn away now to the
[1:15:04] place where we will see movement we will
[1:15:06] get out of this little rut
[1:15:09] forgive me lord get me out of this
[1:15:10] little rut i tried lord i failed i fell
[1:15:14] please get me out of this rut do not
[1:15:17] do not stay down
[1:15:18] do not stay down
[1:15:20] and that i want to tie into
[1:15:23] why is fellowship so important why is
[1:15:26] fellowship here amongst us amongst
[1:15:28] brothers and sisters so important
[1:15:30] because that is where you will get
[1:15:32] rooted you will get anchored
[1:15:35] so if you cost and you and this the the
[1:15:39] preacher here at the front is pulling
[1:15:41] you well is preaching and you are
[1:15:43] pulling you've got something to hold
[1:15:45] if this preacher is throwing a big old
[1:15:48] marlin your way you can handle it
[1:15:50] because you're rooted you are
[1:15:52] fellowshipping here you are anchored in
[1:15:54] the word you know where you stand you're
[1:15:56] convinced you're concerned you can you
[1:15:59] can by the grace of god you can handle
[1:16:02] the thrust the big the weight that's
[1:16:04] coming towards you because you anchored
[1:16:06] you are rooted you can now pull on
[1:16:08] bigger things you can start eating
[1:16:11] bigger things
[1:16:12] take bigger chunks go regurgitated
[1:16:15] during the week and pray important
[1:16:18] meditated i'm preaching to myself
[1:16:20] take more on board
[1:16:22] so fill that big old hole in your heart
[1:16:25] with substance
[1:16:27] with a i don't know marlin steak is that
[1:16:29] anything

[1:16:35] and um
[1:16:36] that is basically what i want to close
[1:16:38] on so the the big fresh pieces of
[1:16:40] spiritual food
[1:16:42] that could shake your being right
[1:16:44] that will test your foundations and test
[1:16:47] your routing fellowship with one another
[1:16:49] other other other fellowships other
[1:16:51] brothers other sisters
[1:16:53] people passing by
[1:16:55] sitting down and and and as brother
[1:16:58] mathen says
[1:16:59] chewing on the fat that that's when you
[1:17:02] that's when you can see are you pulling
[1:17:04] are you are you rooted are you lord what
[1:17:07] you've shown me and the revelation that
[1:17:08] i've received i can stand strong by the
[1:17:12] grace of god and you can feed me lord
[1:17:15] and this is how we fellowship this is
[1:17:17] how we build each other up we're not
[1:17:19] breaking each other down we're not there
[1:17:21] to try and knock each other off we're
[1:17:24] there to
[1:17:25] to to test the strength
[1:17:27] together right we're all soldiers in the
[1:17:29] faith and we fight for the same
[1:17:32] same cause the same outcome the same way
[1:17:35] forward so do you look
[1:17:37] where are you looking do you looking
[1:17:40] do you
[1:17:41] look at
[1:17:43] the right thing
[1:17:45] praise the lord
[1:17:47] so we've got a few
[1:17:49] we've got a few prayer requests
[1:17:51] um
[1:17:52] brother ben is mentioned um
[1:17:55] uh png
[1:17:57] brother
[1:18:01] they are
[1:18:02] in a phase where they're going to
[1:18:04] trying to reconcile with the old
[1:18:06] denominational church
[1:18:08] now
[1:18:11] um
[1:18:12] yes where are we looking so we are
[1:18:14] looking at
[1:18:15] um
[1:18:19] our foundation is set our
[1:18:22] we are convinced that we are concerned
[1:18:24] that
[1:18:25] where brother imos is coming from or
[1:18:27] came from out of the denomination and
[1:18:30] got a nice clean cut
[1:18:32] and is pressing on
[1:18:34] these people
[1:18:35] are trying to come and and and
[1:18:37] understand
[1:18:39] um and please correct me if i'm wrong
[1:18:41] understand
[1:18:43] why are we what we are
[1:18:46] yes
[1:18:47] why
[1:18:48] we've got the i am in us
[1:18:51] they cannot fathom this because they've
[1:18:52] been looking towards this whole
[1:18:54] denominational layer of things and and
[1:18:56] and stuff that's been
[1:18:59] force-fed to them
[1:19:00] so
[1:19:01] these churches are coming together so we
[1:19:03] need to pray fervently that
[1:19:05] they meet
[1:19:07] they meet and they've got a a solid
[1:19:10] foundation

[1:19:43] finishing up that
[1:19:45] i'll make some notes here if there's any
[1:19:47] um any any prayer requests
[1:19:53] yes
[1:19:54] for a place to say oh yes yep
[1:19:57] so the place got sold where brother ben
[1:20:00] both john and marian was living
[1:20:02] and
[1:20:03] they they all need a place
[1:20:06] for a place to stay yes

[1:20:43] that's good that's good
[1:20:48] yeah let's pray that he's his legs don't
[1:20:51] give in and keep on running
[1:20:55] awesome
[1:21:02] revolt
[1:21:03] outreach
[1:21:05] so this uh this coming saturday's
[1:21:07] outreach
[1:21:08] in otaki
[1:21:09] um so
[1:21:11] it'll be good to have you all
[1:21:13] have your support there your prayers for
[1:21:15] them if you can't be there any help is
[1:21:17] needed
[1:21:18] need a few musicians and maybe
[1:21:20] technicians
[1:21:21] um yeah is there anything else brother
[1:21:24] phil
[1:21:25] i want to speak on your behalf
[1:21:38] look the devil is going to attack you
[1:21:39] right
[1:21:41] we've established that
[1:21:43] we've also also established that we hate
[1:21:45] him
[1:21:47] he doesn't like us too much
[1:21:49] but that's okay
[1:21:50] because we made our choice
[1:21:53] so yes it might not look like it's
[1:21:55] getting easier but we will not give in
[1:21:58] we will not fall
[1:22:02] and stop getting up reuben yes
[1:22:11] yep
[1:22:14] another thing is we need to sow the seed
[1:22:18] we don't have to win souls by the grace
[1:22:22] of god if we win a soul
[1:22:24] because he was working and equipping us
[1:22:26] in the right time in the right place
[1:22:28] praise god
[1:22:29] but sower seed
[1:22:31] be your your life needs to be a
[1:22:33] testimony of
[1:22:34] um of the lord's goodness
[1:22:38] sing
[1:22:40] worship
[1:22:42] okay
[1:22:44] so i i probably suggest that we all pray
[1:22:47] together
[1:22:48] i'll start praying and then
[1:22:51] in your in your own
[1:22:53] please lift up um
[1:22:55] prayer is so important though um i've
[1:22:58] read it again it's just that um with
[1:23:00] much incense the angels came in the
[1:23:02] relation
[1:23:04] with the prayers of the saints
[1:23:06] so they had to
[1:23:08] they had to come with more incense
[1:23:11] because of the
[1:23:12] weight
[1:23:14] of the of the prayers of the saints
[1:23:17] so
[1:23:18] don't don't think your prayer doesn't
[1:23:20] count
[1:23:21] it does
[1:23:22] the great economy of god for all the
[1:23:24] prayers come together
[1:23:26] um
[1:23:27] things will happen
[1:23:29] believe it
[1:23:31] okay i'll stop praying
[1:23:37] lord jesus i am absolutely nothing
[1:23:39] nothing without you and me
[1:23:42] lord
[1:25:17] no matter what i feel
[1:25:21] no matter what i hear
[1:25:25] i believe
[1:25:28] no matter what i'm told
[1:25:31] no matter how it seems
[1:25:34] no matter what it costs
[1:25:39] i believe
[1:25:43] and if i look and it seems like it's
[1:25:46] broken
