[27:42] good evening evening God bless you all
[27:45] yes it is a Wednesday I know sometimes
[27:48] people start with um it's a Wednesday
[27:50] it's hard it's been a rough week and
[27:53] blah blah blah we here you are here for
[27:56] a reason you want to be here no one
[27:58] forced you to be here I don't
[28:00] think I don't think anyone's forced you
[28:02] to be here you want to be here right we
[28:05] are our licks of Fire coming together
[28:08] and before I just jump the gun cuz I'm
[28:09] so ready to shoot
[28:12] um uh let's let's let's uh open up in uh
[28:16] in in our scriptures uh Talia if you can
[28:19] put the the scriptures up um nah we'll
[28:22] go to the it will easier be easier to
[28:25] follow um so just go to Matthew Matthew
[28:28] 8 if you wish Matthew 8 verse 5 vers
[28:34] [Music]
[28:35] 5-10 and then we'll also read from First
[28:40] Kings
[28:41] 17
[28:44] um I do like this scripture quite a bit
[28:48] uh I guess because it's has been
[28:50] recently revealed to me sort of what the
[28:53] what the Lord wanted to show me there so
[28:55] w Kings 17 from about 7
[28:58] 17-24 but let's start with Matthew
[29:02] 8 please say Amen if you're there amen
[29:05] and when Jesus was entered into
[29:07] capernium there came unto him a
[29:08] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[29:11] so we all know the scripture this my
[29:13] servant lith at home sick with py
[29:15] grievously tormented and Jesus saith
[29:18] unto him I will come and heal him so he
[29:20] was ready he was willing he was able he
[29:23] had the time to go to him the urion
[29:26] answered said Lord I'm not worthy that y
[29:29] should come under my roof but speak the
[29:33] word only and my servant shall be healed
[29:35] so it doesn't stop here speak the word
[29:38] and you will be he shall be healed now I
[29:41] will explain why I know why I understand
[29:45] and where when I meet another man of
[29:48] authority that this will happen for I am
[29:50] a man under Authority having soldiers
[29:52] under me and I say to this man go and he
[29:56] goeth and another come and and he cometh
[29:59] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[30:02] it so when Jesus heard this he marveled
[30:06] so now deity is standing back and saying
[30:10] I recognize Authority in you and I can
[30:13] see the faith in you I like what I'm
[30:16] seeing and he had to say to them that
[30:19] followed him so you can imagine who was
[30:22] all in that crowd verily I say unto you
[30:24] have not found so great faith no not in
[30:30] Israel you can have your seats and then
[30:32] we can read the next one and this is
[30:34] sort of just to color in the picture
[30:37] First Kings 17 1 Kings 17:1
[30:43] 17 and it came to
[30:46] pass after these things so
[30:49] now uh this is Elijah coming to the uh
[30:52] the woman of
[30:54] um where's she zarap paath
[30:59] uh uh he came to her the Widow and after
[31:03] he she gave him food after she baked the
[31:06] last bread after everything came to
[31:09] fruition as Elijah said thus sayeth the
[31:12] Lord your cross of oil won't run dry
[31:16] your meal won't go stale it will keep on
[31:18] until the day rain will come back in So
[31:22] after this right come to pass this the
[31:26] son of the woman the Mistress of of the
[31:28] house fell sick and his sickness was so
[31:30] sore that there was no breath left in
[31:32] him and she said unto Elijah what have I
[31:35] to do with thee oh man of God Art Thou
[31:38] come unto me to call my sin to
[31:40] remembrance and to slay my son and he
[31:43] said unto her give me thy son and he
[31:46] took him out of her bosom and carried
[31:50] him up into a loft where he abod and
[31:52] laid him upon his own bed so what Elijah
[31:56] is not doing here which is for me now
[31:59] because of this thought and I'll share
[32:01] it with you now I'm trying to lay a
[32:03] foundation here and just get myself a
[32:06] little bit uh I guess relaxed is he
[32:10] doesn't see the woman the woman's
[32:13] response or the woman's statement as
[32:16] audacious she's got the audacity to
[32:19] speak to a prophet of God I've just
[32:22] given her all this I've just saved her
[32:25] life and her son's life and this is now
[32:27] how she talks to me he doesn't do that
[32:31] he goes something's wrong something's
[32:34] off there needs to be a change that
[32:36] needs to come let me go hear from my
[32:39] Lord so he takes him and he cried unto
[32:43] the Lord he said oh Lord my God hast
[32:46] thou also brought evil upon the Widow
[32:48] with whom I sojourn by slaying a son and
[32:52] he stretched himself upon the child
[32:54] three times and Cried unto the Lord and
[32:57] said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this
[33:00] child's Soul come into him again and
[33:03] this and the Lord heard the voice of
[33:05] Elijah and the soul of the child came
[33:08] into him again and he revived and Elijah
[33:11] took the child and brought him down uh
[33:14] out of the chamber into the house and
[33:16] delivered him into unto his mother and
[33:19] Elijah said see thy son
[33:22] liveth and here is the kicker for me and
[33:26] the woman said to Elijah Now by this I
[33:30] know that thou art a man of God and that
[33:33] the word of the Lord in thy mouth is
[33:35] truth yeah wow so after the meal and the
[33:40] oil after that here with the tire where
[33:44] the rubber hits the road here I can see
[33:47] that you are a man of God and you stand
[33:50] by your word and your God listens to you
[33:54] he's not you're not praying to the
[33:55] ceiling I love that
[33:58] so a little a little bit of a segue
[34:00] before I jump into my thought is that uh
[34:04] and and it struck me so so much that I
[34:08] just had to sort of bring it to
[34:10] remembrance to you guys brother hannes
[34:12] was here on on uh a few Sundays
[34:15] ago and he said sort of and now I'm
[34:19] paraphrasing he's saying do do you
[34:21] realize each time that we gather here we
[34:24] are and we are part of a Revival fire we
[34:29] are coming together so I will quote him
[34:32] and then I will I will put up the
[34:35] scripture cuz I sorry the the quote I I
[34:37] had to go and search this up because it
[34:40] it brought a different perspective for
[34:42] me
[34:44] um obviously how how it fits so neatly
[34:47] into my thought for tonight because it's
[34:50] all about perspective and I'll show you
[34:52] now what I'm meaning by that but so he
[34:54] said
[35:00] so the church come together so you can
[35:03] read that so this is what the prophet's
[35:05] saying now you see we are not a divided
[35:08] people we are not and it was so lovely
[35:11] on Sunday afternoon all the languages
[35:14] all everyone coming together and singing
[35:16] and I'm just thinking man if we had um
[35:19] in in it language we talk about a heat
[35:21] map you know if we have this map of a
[35:24] global map of where we all from how we
[35:27] all come together in this little
[35:30] um uh in Willington um I don't want to
[35:33] say it's a big city little city a cool
[35:36] City or not a cool city um but I I guess
[35:40] this is sort of cernium maybe I don't
[35:42] know um here we all come together so
[35:46] we're not divided we've got to be in
[35:48] unity because each one of us holding a
[35:50] part of God and we must come together
[35:53] and then the pillar of fire is
[35:55] manifested in the wholeness in the
[35:58] fullness of it when his church sits
[36:00] together in Heavenly places now brother

[36:28] Fire not from another place but from
[36:30] your heart sitting here and combine
[36:33] together and worship we be we become
[36:36] then the people uh then again the people
[36:39] that can say you know that we know that
[36:42] the pillar of fire is here not by a
[36:45] picture but by looking at your brother
[36:48] and your sister welcome Judah you made
[36:50] it
[36:52] wow I'll I'll I'll ask the police
[36:54] whether you were in time sorry not
[36:57] picture but by looking at your brother
[36:59] and sister's face next to you that's how
[37:02] you see the pfy here that's that's
[37:04] amazing I'm glowing I
[37:07] am that God is here because they carry
[37:12] God okay so let's finish here each one
[37:15] of us holding spiritual gifts spiritual
[37:17] offices coming together brings that
[37:19] Pillar of Fire back again that is so so
[37:23] nice so
[37:29] all these leaks of fire together brings
[37:31] the pillar of fire I'm I'm I'm I seg
[37:34] Wade because I wanted to add this in
[37:36] here my perspective of Why We Gather
[37:40] here changed and and and shifted there
[37:43] was a little bit of a tug and a shift in
[37:45] my direction you know turning away to
[37:48] Jesus um when I when I read this so I
[37:50] wanted to my my thought for tonight is
[37:53] it's all about perspective so when
[37:56] you're out in the world when you sort of
[38:00] um uh how can I put this so yeah so when
[38:03] you're out in the world when you when
[38:04] you're not really here yet settled um in
[38:10] a in a in a state where you were eating
[38:12] the book from Genesis to Revelation if I
[38:15] can put it that way amen a lot of things
[38:18] or perspectives you would think is oh
[38:21] audacious and then your perspective will
[38:23] change as soon as you eat of this book
[38:25] and it's been revealed to you and you
[38:27] see the son of man that's that's
[38:29] stepping behind you pushing you
[38:32] towards Heavenly places and then you go
[38:35] ah the authority not the audacity
[38:39] anymore and that's that's sort of where
[38:41] I want to sort of um lean towards and
[38:45] and and making that that difference or
[38:47] differentiation between the two and say
[38:51] it's so close and the one is almost
[38:53] perverted of the original I don't want
[38:56] to start a new doctrine but but just
[38:58] follow
[38:59] me so audacity it's a courage or
[39:02] confidence of a kind that other people
[39:05] find shocking or rude unusually I like
[39:09] this one unusually strong and especially
[39:11] rude confidence in yourself now not in
[39:15] myself but what is in me what is in me
[39:19] okay so people will find sometimes us a
[39:21] little bit audacious and and and I'll
[39:24] and I'll get to this so as we read now
[39:27] this what was the woman and she had this
[39:29] bread she had this she was looking for
[39:31] sticks and how the prophet pref prepared
[39:35] his heart and how the word prepared her
[39:38] heart God came down and spoke to her and
[39:41] saying um you will you will receive a
[39:44] prophet you need to you need to supply
[39:48] him you need to give him food right and
[39:52] even when he came onto the scene she had
[39:54] a little bit of a push back and she said
[39:57] we're going to die this is now the last
[39:59] bread I I was I was about to make
[40:01] carrying getting all my sticks together
[40:03] and all and then that's it they said
[40:06] okay I acknowledge what you say but God
[40:09] rich in Mercy here's what's going to
[40:12] happen your meal won't go stale and your
[40:15] oil crust will now not empty until the
[40:18] day of rain comes so just look at the
[40:22] the first perspective of of this woman
[40:25] of this Widow would have been the
[40:28] audacity this guy coming in from a
[40:30] foreign land asking me for my last meal
[40:35] but the Lord will
[40:36] provide and the attitude changed because
[40:40] she made that meal and she gave it to
[40:42] him yeah and she saw that so I think as
[40:46] soon as and I believe as soon as Elijah
[40:49] spoke thus sayth the Lord something
[40:53] connected there was a there was identity
[40:56] that was met there was Authority that
[40:59] came and he goes he's speaking from
[41:01] Authority and not from audacity he's
[41:03] speaking from something that's behind
[41:05] pushing him saying this will happen amen
[41:08] doesn't matter what right I had so many
[41:11] examples I had to um one of the best
[41:15] ones I thought was Moses just I wanted
[41:18] to dramatize that brother wanted to get
[41:20] you on here we can just be all old you
[41:23] know we were walking like this just
[41:25] after working with Ben so we didn't have
[41:27] to even pretend so here here's this old
[41:31] man coming and just just just put
[41:34] yourself in that place I don't want to
[41:35] use the word imagine because this is not
[41:37] imaginative this is real put yourself in
[41:39] the place here's this old man coming
[41:41] through that gate we've we've dramatized
[41:43] it so many times and it's Army Legion
[41:47] upon Legion upon Legion and the Pharaoh
[41:49] is standing there and and he's like what
[41:52] do you want and what did the girl sing
[41:55] Let My People Go
[41:57] so imagine now well there we go imagine
[42:01] put yourself there Pharaoh is going you
[42:04] know so this there's two ways he can see
[42:06] this audacity he can go he's so
[42:09] unrealistic with this objective of his
[42:13] that really come on is there is there no
[42:16] other thing that you want to you know
[42:18] let let let let 10 of your people go or
[42:22] are we here in negotiations or you know
[42:25] that that whole so unrealistic so out
[42:29] there so rude um that he
[42:33] goes I'm not getting what you're saying
[42:35] so when you say let my people who you
[42:38] know or he goes this this whole rudess
[42:41] he goes so what gives you the right and
[42:44] he would probably would have gone uh do
[42:46] you see my soldiers do you see they
[42:47] armed they're very dangerous you've got
[42:49] maybe a stick in your hand um I can kill
[42:52] you at any
[42:53] time well could he
[42:57] could he so here's a man coming in
[42:59] Authority she's had that that little
[43:01] push from the from the from the back
[43:03] saying well go save your people always
[43:07] work through a prophet yes and so many
[43:10] times that comes over the pulpit old
[43:12] shamgar man sham go with the oxco just
[43:15] sitting there and if I can dramatize
[43:18] that as well I I I've always pictured
[43:20] him in this type of scenario where
[43:22] this's is open window and he just sees
[43:25] you know the wheat is just just
[43:26] harvesting thing is just that Golden
[43:28] Sunshine and he sees that the Blackness
[43:31] he sees that that 600 troops Men of War
[43:36] approaching now
[43:38] it's me and old Josh we had a good talk
[43:40] who say well you know if if it's three
[43:43] against one in terms of a fight or in
[43:45] terms of some confrontation that's
[43:47] already cowardice that's already you
[43:50] know you can't even see me face to face
[43:52] or man to man you need to bring your
[43:53] buddies they go here they bring 600 to a
[43:57] guy with a ox coat okay there's
[43:59] something wrong there well wrong from
[44:00] their angle so what's the audacity they
[44:03] come and approach him with 600 people
[44:05] and this day the scripture is fulfilled
[44:08] where he jumps through that window and I
[44:10] see him that typical slow motion
[44:12] wollywood scene he just jumps through
[44:14] that window with that Ox goat and he
[44:17] just goes slaying it's real though it's
[44:20] very real but he gets in there and that
[44:23] day Authority came behind him and pushed
[44:26] him along and gave him that little step
[44:29] higher defeat defeat
[44:32] defeat so we did talk about
[44:35] Elijah coming to the Widow and I wanted
[44:38] to explain that shamgar and then brother
[44:43] Isaac so I wanted to build this whole
[44:46] sermon around Jonathan climbing up with
[44:49] his armor Bearer to the
[44:52] Philistines to say just see the
[44:55] perspective from the pH phe's point of
[44:57] view they coming to him him he's coming
[45:01] to them with his armor Bearer like
[45:04] outnumbered completely the audacity that
[45:08] this this Y and his dad he didn't know
[45:11] so he couldn't go Oh Daddy is looking
[45:13] you know behind you no daddy didn't know
[45:15] about this no one knew about this I'm
[45:18] here and he how I wanted to color in the
[45:21] picture is bringing it into today's
[45:23] Times uh terms
[45:25] is we we going after Satan we're coming
[45:29] to Satan in a showdown and saying I'm
[45:33] coming after you amen you know so I'm
[45:35] asking the Lord Lord how should I how
[45:38] should I approach this in my work
[45:40] situation in my life as a husband as a
[45:43] brother how do I approach the situation
[45:46] yes Lord is do I do I move forward do I
[45:49] get that answer saying yes you come up
[45:52] come to me come in my environment okay
[45:56] yes Lord you've got my back and I go
[45:58] that's
[45:59] Authority so but I won't hammer on that
[46:02] too much cuz you took it I'll give it to
[46:04] you you jumped the gun but uh it is
[46:09] probably a good segue to come in here of
[46:12] uh
[46:14] where where even we need to be careful
[46:16] when
[46:17] when we think we have the authority but
[46:20] we don't so I I'll just drop it this in
[46:23] here and then we will go sort of into
[46:25] today's
[46:27] um scenes because I I've been looking at
[46:30] historical figures but I know we've got
[46:33] a young crowd here and we've got people
[46:34] that will ask what about today give me
[46:37] an example of today is the message real
[46:39] today or is it living in us today
[46:42] wonderful um song that we had from the
[46:44] nanas as well it is very much living and
[46:48] well
[46:50] um brother brandom says then we can we
[46:53] can go to this um if you want John John
[46:58] 519 John
[47:02] 519 I think I did save it here yeah John
[47:07] 5:19 then answered Jesus said unto him
[47:11] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[47:13] the son can do nothing of himself but
[47:16] what he sees the father do for what
[47:19] things soever he does he does uh these
[47:23] also doeth the son likewise for the
[47:26] father loveth his son and showeth him
[47:28] all things that himself doeth and he
[47:31] shall show Greater Works than these that
[47:34] you will be that you may Marvel so here
[47:37] brother B saying that exactly that
[47:39] verily verily absolutely absolutely I
[47:41] say unto you the son can do nothing but
[47:44] what he I see the father doing yeah so
[47:48] how could a man have the audacity to
[47:51] call himself a Divine healer when Jesus
[47:54] Christ here in man form didn't even
[47:56] claim to be a Divine healer he said I
[47:59] can do nothing in myself that's either
[48:01] the truth or it isn't the truth he said
[48:04] I only do as the father shows me I do
[48:08] nothing of my own will or nothing myself
[48:11] the father don't impress it on me so
[48:13] here I want to we we can't we can't
[48:16] think we are in in in Authority in an
[48:19] emotional state you are going to be
[48:21] emotional but are you in an authorative
[48:24] state or are you just making a
[48:27] claim do we do everything through our
[48:30] father through Jesus Christ through the
[48:32] one that's leading
[48:34] us and this is uh oh maybe I'll don't
[48:37] want to jump the gun there too much so
[48:39] let's
[48:40] go and this is now where I guess where
[48:43] the tire hits the road is where is it
[48:46] today brother Ed give me something for
[48:48] today so um I was trying to find the
[48:51] sermon but it was I think in our 2022
[48:54] Camp brother C dick was here and he
[48:58] started talking about uh he had to keep
[49:01] his truck
[49:02] license and he had to do his blood
[49:05] checks and you know doctors all that
[49:07] confirm that he's in a good medical
[49:09] condition to obtain that truck truck
[49:11] license sorry license and the doctor
[49:14] phones him and he confirms with him he's
[49:17] got a condition I can't remember if it
[49:20] was to do with his diabetes over his
[49:21] blood pressure or anything like that and
[49:24] what does brother card says no I don't
[49:28] get a second opinion you know that's
[49:30] when you can get a second opinion not in
[49:33] the word and then so imagine now imagine
[49:37] me again the doctor on the phone saying
[49:41] I'm the doctor in this situation I'm
[49:43] calling you I'm seeing I'm seeing it
[49:46] here's the here's the facts he goes uh
[49:50] no I
[49:53] don't you know
[49:55] so man of authority comes and he says
[49:59] Lord not my will be done but your will
[50:02] be done I do not need this I do not want
[50:06] this I do not accept that bag of snakes
[50:08] that box of
[50:09] snakes apologies doctor but I think you
[50:13] might be wrong so they get the second
[50:16] opinion he comes into the and I'm
[50:18] paraphrasing he comes in back into the
[50:21] um Clinic they do the things plot test
[50:24] two days later of whenever they go
[50:26] you're clean he said I told you so
[50:29] yeah this is this is Authority okay all
[50:32] right all right but now brother Ed
[50:35] that's brother Diggs man yo how can we
[50:38] compete with him okay so let's bring it
[50:42] back home now to shik
[50:45] Tabernacle um there was a there was a
[50:47] time I've only seen my wife sayani twice
[50:52] very very very sick very sick this is
[50:56] the the first time um sister um bronin
[51:01] was still here the the the Andy and them
[51:04] were still here
[51:06] and she was sick that she got up the in
[51:09] the
[51:10] morning and I thought well I'm I'm
[51:14] sometimes insensitive in terms of how
[51:16] sick are you cuz I I go all quiet when
[51:19] I'm sick you know just leave me alone
[51:21] I'll get better give me a half a day you
[51:23] know we back we back running so I I
[51:26] sometimes I cannot judge how sick people
[51:28] are you know it like so should I leave
[51:30] you or should I just carry on and you'll
[51:32] get better cuz that's how I en Vision I
[51:35] would do how do I how do I approach this
[51:38] so what I've done in this situation I
[51:40] thought okay I'll I'll take the kids off
[51:41] your hand I'll get them ready you go see
[51:44] the doctor and we'll fix it and we and
[51:47] we can go to church on
[51:49] Sunday
[51:51] now I think also in hindsight and and
[51:54] and in my subconscious something must
[51:56] must have said if I can just get it to
[51:59] the
[52:00] hospital but now the perspective changed
[52:03] because it's not H hospital or
[52:05] Wellington hospital this is our
[52:07] Hospital okay how many of you seen
[52:10] healing started here in this place and
[52:13] came to fruition in this place so
[52:15] something said in my in in the back of
[52:17] my mind our little church is the
[52:19] hospital the gift of healing gets
[52:21] ministered here on a weekly basis I need
[52:23] to get it here I need to get it here now
[52:27] of course we we are human we are flesh
[52:29] we go let's get that opinion from the
[52:31] doctor let's get the meds going
[52:32] antibiotics and and I'm in the car and
[52:34] we can come and in this case she goes
[52:39] the doctor went to Lundy and said you
[52:40] Mystery Case number one for the day and
[52:43] that was her
[52:44] diagnosis she comes home she could
[52:47] barely walk man so now I need to get in
[52:49] the car and everything but we're still
[52:51] going to
[52:53] church so now here's my lovely little
[52:56] wife sitting and going this man this the
[53:00] audacity that he's got I just want to be
[53:04] in bed I just want to heal up I just
[53:06] don't and he just pressing and he just
[53:09] wants to go to
[53:11] church and the testimony testimony comes
[53:14] as soon as she walks in I think it was
[53:16] sister bronan that caught you went with
[53:18] you sat with you basically the whole
[53:20] service and you had prayer and
[53:22] everything and she felt that tingle that
[53:25] wave that warmth coming over a body
[53:29] instantly instantly now I'm
[53:32] saying is that out of
[53:34] authority I knew Hallelujah I knew and
[53:39] it can be hard sometimes how do you
[53:41] relay this how do you come to the right
[53:44] Hospital in that moment and that's
[53:46] physical healing right how many healing
[53:48] of the hearts can only take place here
[53:51] there's no psychic Ward or Wellington
[53:54] whever whatever that will help you
[53:56] shakina Tabernacle who the licks of fire
[54:00] that comes together that brings the
[54:01] pillar fire down that brings the
[54:04] authority and place it in the center of
[54:06] it all that's the one that can heal it
[54:08] that's the one that can fix everything
[54:10] right that's why we're here praise the
[54:14] Lord
[54:16] so she forgave me had uh she got better
[54:21] and she got a testimony out of it we got
[54:23] a testimony out of it and it was it was
[54:25] real it cannot be cannot be manufactured
[54:28] in
[54:29] that okay hold on brother Ed how do you
[54:32] change this perception and perspective
[54:35] then how can I change from audacity to
[54:38] Authority I think you already know the
[54:40] answer how do we get to a point of
[54:42] authority on the Promises in the word of
[54:46] our day now do we feel sometimes a
[54:50] little tug we feel a little shove
[54:54] something that's here Davy come here
[54:57] please so you're looking at the the the
[55:00] so you know sometimes the deacons they
[55:01] they will they will lead you to your
[55:03] seat and you just have this just this on
[55:05] your shoulder no you go you you sit
[55:07] there you know nothing it's gentlemanly
[55:11] you know but but there's some direction
[55:13] you know there's that little tug you
[55:15] know or someone goes oh just watch out
[55:17] for the car and you just feel that
[55:19] little you know the skirt just pulled
[55:21] watch out for the car yep it's passed
[55:23] you can go now all right nothing nothing
[55:26] in the way nothing step nothing jumping
[55:29] in front and just oh I saved your life
[55:32] um that push that shove and then
[55:35] internalize it now from the heart from
[55:37] the soul from that little button what is
[55:40] that push what's that pressure pushing
[55:42] you saying go now you know holding you
[55:45] back sometimes but other times it just
[55:48] on now go now go now your path is made
[55:52] the authority you're standing on the
[55:53] word now how do we get to that point you
[55:56] feel sometimes that shift and chains
[55:58] inside of you can't put that finger on
[56:01] and that's that little
[56:03] button do you some days get up and go
[56:06] and you say to yourself enough is enough
[56:08] I'm tired of all of this I'm taking my
[56:10] mountain that was that Shamar moment
[56:13] right Joshua and Caleb check the
[56:15] audacity here 12 Spies went out 10 come
[56:20] back and say they big as brother they as
[56:24] big as brother Ed yeah yeah and uh we
[56:28] can't take them Joshua and Caleb come
[56:30] and
[56:31] goes tree chop them chop them at the
[56:33] legs kick him easy easy easy yeah so
[56:39] there's that um hello the Lord said and
[56:43] promised us we'll take this and Caleb
[56:46] said that's my Mountain I think Caleb
[56:48] was the one there he's saying it's my
[56:51] Mountain that's it it's made up I'm I
[56:54] don't even have to go and reread this
[56:56] it's it's there I'm taking it Josh are
[56:58] you joining or not let's move whatever
[57:02] about the 10 spies do you read ever
[57:05] again about them so that's the that's
[57:08] that shove that pressure saying I cannot
[57:11] go back now I cannot go back
[57:14] now
[57:17] so that shove that little button inside
[57:20] of you that's what's growing now right
[57:23] that's the Holy Ghost growing in you
[57:26] cannot be stale and cannot sit on a
[57:28] Mountaintop the whole day or the whole
[57:31] time
[57:32] so in recent events in my own life um
[57:36] the Lord showed me so why do we have
[57:38] these little Mountaintop experiences

[57:44] lovely here let's dance and have a have
[57:47] a song you know it's good to have that
[57:50] but I think if you stop and just see
[57:53] what's coming I think the Lord's giving
[57:55] you that opportunity
[57:56] put on your 2020 Vision give that Eagle
[57:59] Vision we're on our way we we can't stop
[58:02] here it's a beautiful place but we're on
[58:04] our way there there's a there's a bit of
[58:06] a bit of a valley bit of a dip but we'll
[58:09] get there do you see beyond that dip
[58:11] beyond that Valley I want you there
[58:14] Hallelujah so enjoy the time that you're
[58:16] there I don't want to take anything away
[58:18] from you but that's where we're
[58:22] heading so do you know why God gives you
[58:25] that mountain top the Eagle Vision it's
[58:27] what's ahead Rejoice on the mountain
[58:29] Toops but don't miss the purpose of
[58:32] those
[58:33] moments okay brother
[58:35] Ed how do I get your this Authority that
[58:39] you're speaking of heal surrender get
[58:43] baptized marry him soak in the washing
[58:47] of the word yes Lord the Lord shall
[58:49] fight for you you shall hold your peace
[58:52] my presence will go with the I will give
[58:56] you
[58:57] rest the seventh day God rested how do
[58:59] we enter God's rest with the Holy Ghost
[59:03] receive the holy go be led and rest wait
[59:05] a minute sounds a little bit audacious
[59:08] that um I'm saying you need to go and
[59:11] rest how do i f fight for my Mountain
[59:14] exactly that's that Paradox that man
[59:17] doesn't understand and can only come
[59:20] through
[59:22] Revelation once the Revelation strikes
[59:25] the sea in you that button that tugs
[59:28] that presses that grows your identity
[59:31] gets quickened I am a son our daughter
[59:35] of the most high God creating the UN
[59:38] Universe with a word and expressed
[59:41] thought and the promise he laid upon
[59:44] your heart for this day with that
[59:46] Authority you take what is righteously
[59:50] yours and I just want to finish with
[59:52] this the whole idea of authority
[59:58] um and where do we where do we get our
[1:00:02] rest where does it all start in this
[1:00:05] journey but notice he only comes to
[1:00:08] those who is looking for him he only
[1:00:11] will heal tonight those who are looking
[1:00:13] for him to heal he will only save those
[1:00:16] who are looking to be saved if you're
[1:00:20] not looking to be saved you're not in
[1:00:22] that word if you're not Lord I want your
[1:00:24] answer and it's it's not on YouTube Lord
[1:00:27] I know it's here amen you will find it
[1:00:31] you will find it and he will give you
[1:00:32] that answer amen and if we didn't have a
[1:00:36] an understanding of what the the word
[1:00:39] Authority means it's a power to
[1:00:41] influence or command thought opinion or
[1:00:46] behavior attitude attitude there was no
[1:00:50] blinking or no thinking twice when
[1:00:53] Shambo when Joshua when this Widow
[1:00:57] did what they had to do the authority
[1:01:00] came they fell into place there was
[1:01:02] order in the land and that happened so
[1:01:05] please find your solers here amen and I
[1:01:09] think that is me for tonight but so
[1:01:13] fittingly our our little song uh
[1:01:16] musicians you can
[1:01:18] come our little song that we are singing
[1:01:21] now uh and and prepared allegedly for
[1:01:24] for camp
[1:01:26] the rock of re Revelation I was telling
[1:01:29] a few a few of the people uh here in
[1:01:33] church I was cutting this song on
[1:01:35] YouTube and and we were we were having a
[1:01:38] good discussion should we give this now
[1:01:40] to the world or not you know should we
[1:01:42] should we spoil it for ourselves in the
[1:01:44] in in in humanity or is it now the the
[1:01:47] authority of word that needs to go out
[1:01:49] now and so many so many people have come
[1:01:52] back from across the globe saying
[1:01:54] there's just such a bless in but within
[1:01:57] that time when I was cutting the song
[1:01:59] and I thought so what shall I call it I
[1:02:01] was waiting now for brother Isaac and
[1:02:03] brother to help me with a what do we
[1:02:06] call this now you know it is the song's
[1:02:08] name but the the the time when he when
[1:02:10] he sort of released that testimony when
[1:02:13] he wrote the song we put all this
[1:02:15] together it's not just a song this is a
[1:02:17] testimony my title of that was this is
[1:02:21] shikina Tabernacle
[1:02:22] 2024 it struck me so much that this is
[1:02:25] is real you know and that's why the word
[1:02:28] of this day is so living it's so
[1:02:30] powerful it's so so in us now you know
[1:02:34] we are convinced we are concerned so

[1:02:38] last on and let's sing this song then
