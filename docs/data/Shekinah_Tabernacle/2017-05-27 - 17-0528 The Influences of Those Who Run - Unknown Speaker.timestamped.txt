[16:58] now I'm not sure that all of you are
[17:02] aware of what happened last yesterday so
[17:05] the men that were there I just want to
[17:08] give a quick quick understanding to
[17:13] everyone about how much that meant to
[17:16] Ben so Ben Ben also goes to church and
[17:20] he believes and yesterday the fact that
[17:24] so many strangers rocked up at his house
[17:26] and helped him with things that he just
[17:28] doesn't get to things that he's been
[17:31] meaning to do for a long time but it
[17:32] just doesn't have time because he's not
[17:34] at home he was overwhelmed so it might
[17:37] not have looked like it while we were
[17:39] working but afterwards I stayed back and
[17:41] just had a chat to him and he said this
[17:43] is what it should be like people should
[17:45] just help each other and what was
[17:48] comforting for me so he made the comment
[17:51] about you know he would like to do
[17:53] something back so that he can get
[17:55] someone you know maybe another day like
[17:58] that and it just came up to me and I
[18:02] realized that us that were there we
[18:06] weren't expecting something back and I
[18:08] think that's one of the that's one of
[18:10] the characters of God as well you know
[18:12] that he puts in us that we would do for
[18:15] love and not not expect anything back
[18:17] because that's just who he is in us and
[18:20] that we can live like that without
[18:22] without expecting him to do something
[18:24] back for us and I would just I would
[18:27] like to thank everyone that came
[18:29] yesterday to help and those who prayed
[18:33] keep on praying
[18:34] Sinead was was she quite shocked because
[18:37] she she brought the kids back home and

[54:47] chapter 14 verse 1
[55:02] the biggest foot in the water isn't the
[55:05] Lord spake unto Moses saying this shall
[55:09] be the law of the leper and the day of
[55:11] his cleansing
[55:12] he shall be brought unto the priests of
[55:15] the preshow go forth out of the camp and
[55:17] the preshow look and behold of them if
[55:19] the plague of leprosy be healed in the
[55:21] leper then shall the priests command to
[55:25] take for him that is to be cleansed to
[55:28] birds alive and clean and cedar wood and
[55:31] scarlet and hyssop and the priest shall
[55:34] command that one of the birds be killed
[55:36] in an earthen vessel over running water
[55:38] as for the living bird he shall take it
[55:41] and the cedar wood and the scarlet and
[55:43] the hyssop and shall dip them and the
[55:45] living bird and the blood of the bird
[55:46] that was killed over the righting water
[55:48] and he shall sprinkle upon him that that
[55:52] is to be cleansed from leprosy seven
[55:54] times and shall pronounce him clean and
[55:56] shall let the living bird loose into the
[56:00] open field and let's just go to let's
[56:03] just go to Hebrews chapter 11 again just
[56:06] want to continue continue my thought
[56:10] about let us run I think after this is
[56:15] one more part but we'll just see as the
[56:18] Lord opens it but so Hebrews 11 and 32
[56:22] and we'll read down to 12 verse to live
[56:26] it in 32
[56:27] what shall I more say for the time would
[56:32] fail me to tell of gideon an american of
[56:35] samson of jeff knee of david also and
[56:37] samuel of the prophets who through faith
[56:40] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[56:41] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[56:43] lions quenched the violence of fire
[56:45] escaped edge of the sword out of
[56:47] weakness were made strong waxed valiant
[56:50] and fight turned to flight the armies of
[56:52] the aliens people receive their dead
[56:54] raised to life again others were
[56:56] tortured not accepting deliverance that
[56:58] they might obtain a better resurrection
[57:00] others had cruel had trial of cruel
[57:04] mockings and scourgings yea moreover of
[57:06] bonds and imprisonment they were stoned
[57:08] they were sawn asunder were tempted were
[57:10] slain with the sword we want they
[57:12] wandered about in sheepskins and go
[57:15] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[57:17] tormented of whom the world was not
[57:19] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[57:22] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[57:23] earth and these all having obtained a
[57:27] good report through faith received not
[57:29] the promise God having provided some
[57:31] better thing for us that they without us
[57:34] should not be made perfect wherefore
[57:36] seeing we also are compassed about with
[57:39] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[57:41] aside every weight and the sin that
[57:43] there so easily beset us and let us run
[57:45] with patience the race that is set
[57:47] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[57:49] and finisher of our faith who for the
[57:51] joy that was set before him endured the
[57:53] cross despising the shame is sit down at
[57:56] the right hand of God who was read the
[57:58] next verse as well for consider him that
[58:00] endured such contradiction of sinners
[58:02] against himself
[58:04] they should be weary wearied and faint
[58:06] in your minds Amen may the Lord bless
[58:10] his word you may have your seats this
[58:11] morning so I want to talk about if I
[58:17] could if I could give this a title I
[58:19] want to speak about the influences of
[58:22] those who rent or those who run now
[58:25] brother Branham would would quote a a a
[58:27] poem and it's called the psalm of life
[58:29] and I'm going to read it to you it says
[58:31] tell me not in mournful numbers life is
[58:35] but an empty dream for the soul for the
[58:38] soul is dead that slumbers and things
[58:40] are not what they seem
[58:41] life is real life is earnest and the
[58:44] grave is not its goal dust thou art and
[58:47] dust returnest was not spoken of the
[58:50] soul not enjoyment and not sorrow as our
[58:53] destined end alway but to act that each
[58:57] tomorrow finds us farther than today art
[59:00] is long and time is fleeting and our
[59:02] hearts though stout and brave still like
[59:06] muffled drums are beating funeral
[59:08] marches to the grave in the world's
[59:11] broad field of battle in the bivouac of
[59:14] life be not like dumb driven cattle be a
[59:17] hero in the strife trust not future
[59:21] however pleasant let the dead past bury
[59:24] its dead act act in the living present
[59:27] heart within and go
[59:28] right overhead lives live site of great
[59:32] men all remind us we can make our lives
[59:34] sublime and departing leave behind us
[59:38] footprints on the sands of time
[59:40] footprints that perhaps another sailing
[59:43] over life Solon Maine a furlong and
[59:46] shipwreck brother seeing shall take
[59:49] heart again let us then be up and doing
[59:52] with a heart for any fate still
[59:55] achieving still pursuing learn to labor
[59:57] and to wait amen brother bran would
[1:00:01] quote that quite the sum of life many
[1:00:03] times and it tells us to me we should be
[1:00:11] up and doing we should be heroes in the
[1:00:14] strife amen we can't just be be like
[1:00:17] dumb driven cattle I mean but we have to
[1:00:20] we have to press the mark of the high
[1:00:22] calling now in influence you know the
[1:00:26] definition of an influence is the
[1:00:28] capacity to have an effect on the
[1:00:30] character development or behavior of
[1:00:32] someone or something so we have all been
[1:00:37] influenced by something right our lives
[1:00:40] have been shaped by influence and it's
[1:00:43] normally it's normally the ones who
[1:00:47] influence us the most in a positive way
[1:00:50] they are the ones you want to become
[1:00:52] like okay so now when we see people do
[1:00:56] great things I'm just going to lay a bit
[1:00:58] of a foundation aw do you think because
[1:01:00] we we you're your influence you are
[1:01:03] reflecting something that's influenced
[1:01:05] you I mean you are you want to I'll just
[1:01:09] read you're the one when when you see a
[1:01:12] person doing great when we see people do
[1:01:14] great things it captures the
[1:01:16] imaginations of those who see them do it
[1:01:19] yep and they begin to copy that person
[1:01:23] act like them speak like them dress like
[1:01:26] them do what they do because their
[1:01:28] imagination has been captured because
[1:01:30] they've seen a life that's been lived in
[1:01:32] front of them I know I've told the story
[1:01:35] many times but when I was about seven or
[1:01:37] eight you know I really loved cricket I
[1:01:39] love cricket
[1:01:40] longer than that but it was then i i i
[1:01:43] saw a pace followed by the name of Danny
[1:01:46] Morrison play for New Zealand and I
[1:01:48] wanted to be a fast bowler member my
[1:01:50] imagination got captured right and so I
[1:01:53] wanted to bowl like him I wanted to run
[1:01:55] up like him I wanted to you know I
[1:01:57] wanted to be just like him and so when I
[1:01:59] would practice cricket I'd imagine that
[1:02:01] my imagination was I'm him but because
[1:02:04] when I had seen someone run right I had
[1:02:07] seen a life that was lived before me
[1:02:09] even though it's just a little screen
[1:02:10] where I saw he became my hero so he
[1:02:16] became my hero and my imagination was
[1:02:18] captured by that man and I wanted me to
[1:02:21] become just like him right so and that
[1:02:26] can be that can be anything in life it
[1:02:31] is so my seven-year-old heart was I
[1:02:34] wanted to be just like him hello seven
[1:02:38] and eight year olds right amen hello
[1:02:41] every other age because your imagination
[1:02:43] is caught by your you've been influenced
[1:02:46] by something and subconsciously you want
[1:02:49] to become it and it can be just a
[1:02:51] religious person it can be in a
[1:02:53] different person it can be a worldly
[1:02:55] person or can be Christ themselves amen
[1:02:58] it can be his work amen set the pins now
[1:03:02] now so we all know we've all seen feats
[1:03:07] of great human ability and they've all
[1:03:09] captured our imagination once in our
[1:03:11] life now but instead of wanting to
[1:03:15] become you know an all black or a
[1:03:19] springbok or a ragged Bushman or
[1:03:21] whatever whatever you've seen in life
[1:03:23] and you want to become instead of
[1:03:25] letting that capture your imagination
[1:03:26] why don't you let him that died for you
[1:03:30] him that's going to resurrect you come
[1:03:33] that's going to take you in a rapture
[1:03:34] why don't you let him capture your
[1:03:36] imagination
[1:03:37] and because many times we think of
[1:03:39] imagination just as a bad thing but what
[1:03:41] don't you imagine God living what do you
[1:03:43] begin to think about what he could do I
[1:03:45] meant God we have one life to live I
[1:03:48] mean we're all at the prime of our
[1:03:50] spiritual life it's the best time to be
[1:03:53] alive and God wants to take you out oh
[1:03:56] I'm going to read a quote from perfect
[1:03:58] strength and perfect weakness that that
[1:04:00] God's God's strategy brother Bram says
[1:04:03] is to take empty human vessels and shake
[1:04:06] the world with them
[1:04:07] that's a shred that's his plan take
[1:04:09] empty human vessels and shake the world
[1:04:12] Amen you see now just a little bit see
[1:04:15] just like at Pentecost at Pentecost what
[1:04:17] did he do and taking them ten days to
[1:04:19] get all emptied up but they were all
[1:04:22] standing there with their vessels turned
[1:04:23] up and God took himself and filled them
[1:04:26] up that's all they shook the world
[1:04:28] poured himself into them that's the need
[1:04:31] of today that's what we need today as
[1:04:33] empty vessels yes sir so God can fill
[1:04:36] them up amen and you cannot take them
[1:04:39] I've got to bypass a lot here he says
[1:04:41] God could not use them as long as
[1:04:43] they're already filled up if you're full
[1:04:46] of the old theological training God
[1:04:48] can't use you God's got to have empty
[1:04:50] vessels so he can fill them now Elisha
[1:04:53] didn't say go get some vessels and
[1:04:54] borrow a lot of oil and we'll see if you
[1:04:56] can get a good sale price on it you've
[1:04:58] got to get a little more and you can pay
[1:05:00] the neighbor back he said just get the
[1:05:02] empty vessels that's all you need and
[1:05:04] that's what it was at Pentecost they had
[1:05:06] empty vessels so God can fill them up
[1:05:09] brother this day demands that amen empty
[1:05:12] vessels this day's got to have that
[1:05:15] we'll have that all Paris amen so you
[1:05:18] know why don't you just let your
[1:05:19] imagination you doesn't matter what age
[1:05:22] you are let your imagination swing out a
[1:05:25] little but Jesus Christ is the same
[1:05:27] yesterday today and forever I'm in the
[1:05:30] same same God that spoke to Samuel as a
[1:05:32] young boy can speak to you and we can
[1:05:34] fill your life I mean can you you use
[1:05:36] you to shake this world we let your Matt
[1:05:38] go but we think of you know what job

[1:07:39] know we can speaker any of the great
[1:07:41] church young men and women of faith down
[1:07:43] through the ages but if they could be
[1:07:45] standing here today

[1:08:05] to be just like him I mean then Paul saw
[1:08:07] him on the road to Damascus it'd be
[1:08:09] incredible for them to stand here I mean

[1:08:59] than a television right here and we've
[1:09:02] got our head buried and stuff yeah
[1:09:03] that's going to burn in ashes I mean I
[1:09:08] don't think that's too strong we are
[1:09:10] cool to run I'm not trying to dig up a
[1:09:13] simmer from few weeks ago but let him
[1:09:15] influence you who was influencing your
[1:09:17] life the most I mean is it is it just
[1:09:20] religion trying to try to count your
[1:09:22] Osito you're conscious but I go to
[1:09:24] church but I spend a little bit of time
[1:09:26] that's just a fig leaf but I listened to
[1:09:28] a few misses well that's just a fig leaf
[1:09:30] religion yeah let's try to just cover up
[1:09:33] your conscience with a conviction if God
[1:09:35] is convicting you say God pour it in but
[1:09:38] that's a gift of God to be even
[1:09:40] convicted amen
[1:09:43] Hey amen we let him take up
[1:09:53] your imagination he says that really
[1:09:57] possible
[1:09:58] he shook he he used 120 people in the
[1:10:02] upper Murray shook the world the world
[1:10:04] is still being changed because of those
[1:10:06] ones Amen you say well is it still

[1:10:14] workplace or shake your family whatever
[1:10:17] your world is God was it take you holily
[1:10:21] well I've never seen it done we've seen
[1:10:23] it though we've got a record of here of
[1:10:25] the world being shaken my people who
[1:10:28] sold out a man they said I'm going to go
[1:10:30] out the loss of yours despised few and
[1:10:33] they gave themselves they really there
[1:10:36] were people like us
[1:10:37] I mean exactly like us you go through
[1:10:41] all the way down through the scripture
[1:10:42] there were people just like us but they
[1:10:45] were influenced by someone anybody
[1:10:47] unseen God hallelujah and they said I'm
[1:10:50] going to let my life be shaped by that
[1:10:52] one amen
[1:10:57] that's the one Jesus read I'm going to
[1:11:02] come back to it we've seen that same son
[1:11:04] of men running this day the son of man
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ has been revealed to a
[1:11:09] Ministry of a prophet don't let that
[1:11:11] become common to you I've seen that same
[1:11:13] God run yeah amen it's like we are back
[1:11:17] in the book of Acts scene because we are
[1:11:19] robbers like we're it's like we just
[1:11:21] with Timothy that you know that next
[1:11:22] generation that's come down that's us
[1:11:24] I made a Paul had a burden I want to
[1:11:28] pass this faith down amen and it should
[1:11:31] be the same thing you say well we might
[1:11:32] take a rapture tomorrow I say please God
[1:11:35] can it be oh yeah but it should be in us
[1:11:37] I want to pass this I want to live a
[1:11:39] life that also influenced my children
[1:11:41] those around me I say I've seen one run
[1:11:44] I mean I want to become like that one
[1:11:47] that should be us now let's go to Isaiah
[1:11:50] 6 and 1 because influence is very
[1:11:53] powerful influence is incredibly
[1:11:56] powerful and influence that is not of
[1:11:58] God a meant that isn't it that is taken
[1:12:01] in a wrong way can actually block the
[1:12:03] visitation
[1:12:04] of the Lord it's very powerful I mean so
[1:12:09] if your mind is wandering off onto all
[1:12:11] kinds of things you should just put a
[1:12:12] stop there think on him I mean let's not
[1:12:17] let's be rugged yeah let's be up and
[1:12:20] doing I mean let's be determined
[1:12:24] amen members Isaiah 6:1 now before we
[1:12:28] read here Isaiah was influenced greatly
[1:12:33] by King Uzziah they are both young they
[1:12:37] both got on really well and brother bam
[1:12:39] and I'll read some quotes he leaned on
[1:12:41] the arm of the yo-yo the prophet leaned
[1:12:44] on the arm of the king he looked up to
[1:12:45] the king Isaiah was a prophet of God yes
[1:12:50] well can't agree but they had to be an
[1:12:52] influence that had to die in order for a
[1:12:55] visitation Isaiah 6 and 1 and the year
[1:12:59] now notice in the year that King Uzziah
[1:13:00] died this influence died right I saw
[1:13:06] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[1:13:09] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:13:10] temple above it stood seraphim's each
[1:13:13] one had six wings with twain covered his
[1:13:16] face and with twain covered his feet and
[1:13:18] with twain heated fly and one cried out
[1:13:21] to another saying holy holy holy is the
[1:13:24] Lord God of hosts the whole earth is
[1:13:26] full of his glory and the posts of the
[1:13:28] door moved at the voice of him that
[1:13:30] cried the house was filled with smoke
[1:13:32] then said I was me for I am undone
[1:13:36] because I'm a man of unclean lips and I
[1:13:39] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:13:41] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:13:44] king the Lord of hosts in 1:1 a den flew
[1:13:48] one of the seraphim's unto me having a
[1:13:50] live coal in his hand which he had taken
[1:13:52] with the tongs from off the altar and he
[1:13:54] laid it upon us upon my mouth and said
[1:13:57] lo this is this has touched thy lips my
[1:13:59] iniquity is taken away thy sin is purged
[1:14:02] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:14:04] saying who shall I send who will go for
[1:14:06] us and he said and then said I here I am
[1:14:10] send me so here was a god-ordained
[1:14:14] prophet this is how strong influence
[1:14:16] there's a God ordained prophet and King
[1:14:19] Uzziah was a godly King until he got
[1:14:22] lifted up in Pride and wanted to become
[1:14:23] a priest and go offer sacrifices yo do
[1:14:29] the incense in this place of a priest
[1:14:31] but he was never priest and he got
[1:14:33] lifted up in his in his heart because
[1:14:35] the Lord had blessed him so much and so
[1:14:37] now this influence had to die his Isaiah
[1:14:41] with in the Book of Isaiah as the whole
[1:14:43] Bible he goes back from when iniquity is
[1:14:47] found in the heart of Lucifer and he
[1:14:49] falls he goes all the way from there he
[1:14:52] brings in Calvary Redemption salvation
[1:14:55] and the new heavens and new earth
[1:14:56] it goes all the way that's the whole
[1:14:59] Bible in one book I'll say in order for
[1:15:02] that inspiration to be given that
[1:15:05] influence had to die
[1:15:06] mm-hmm n I mean and these influences in
[1:15:10] life that's right
[1:15:11] that are actually holding back the
[1:15:13] visitation yeah amen I want this to sink
[1:15:17] in
[1:15:17] is this influences in life when we lean
[1:15:20] too much on the arm of flesh can't stop
[1:15:23] and does stop the visitation of God yeah
[1:15:26] a meant that people because he was a God
[1:15:29] ordained prophet but he wasn't fully in
[1:15:31] his office there as he should have been
[1:15:33] the influence had to die amen and it's
[1:15:37] the same thing with us now I'm going to
[1:15:40] read from influence brother Brown who
[1:15:41] speaks of so here too this influence had
[1:15:44] to die and then he saw the Lord High
[1:15:46] lifted up and then he is cleansed and
[1:15:48] commissioned and set into service amen
[1:15:51] and it's like US influence has to die
[1:15:54] and then we see our state that we're in
[1:15:57] this world is so blinding yes Amen this
[1:16:01] thing can be so blinding oh yeah
[1:16:05] Amen the influence has to die Amy this
[1:16:10] is just as bad as heroin yeah you know
[1:16:14] the internet it is just as addictive
[1:16:16] with all these other things but people
[1:16:18] justify themselves say well I don't
[1:16:21] shoot needles into my arm
[1:16:22] but you still are just as addicted
[1:16:26] I mean hey God wants to shake the earth
[1:16:29] one more time I mean he wants to shake
[1:16:33] this world I mean he wants to shake this
[1:16:36] world brother Gramps hit the end of his
[1:16:37] ministry I'll ride this trail again and
[1:16:40] that wasn't him riding the trail it was
[1:16:42] God speaking first person through
[1:16:44] through a prophet just like David under
[1:16:47] the inspiration says my God my God was
[1:16:49] Elfa sake of me he was looking at
[1:16:51] Calvary David wasn't forsaken he was a
[1:16:54] king on the throne but as God speaking
[1:16:56] first person through a man
[1:16:58] so when brother Han said I'll ride this
[1:16:59] trail again that was God speaking saying
[1:17:01] I'm going to ride this trail I'm going
[1:17:04] to do the same minister again but not in
[1:17:06] one man I mean but in a many many men

[1:17:17] position amen he begins to speak the
[1:17:19] Word of God hallelujah the whole world

[1:18:53] about whether Russian subs were and what
[1:18:55] they were doing
[1:18:55] how Wilden fear them but they turned it
[1:18:58] down and the world is falling apart
[1:19:00] amen incredible things have happened
[1:19:03] I'm you take you take history and you
[1:19:05] just take thee becomes the Prophet comes

[1:19:17] opens upon the earth the whole world has
[1:19:20] changed but we've been bought
[1:19:23] I think I see the last week we have been
[1:19:24] born in this change world
[1:19:26] but just as all hell is here heaven is
[1:19:29] present amen so let heaven influence you
[1:19:34] yes Amen this whole world is different
[1:19:37] because of a ministry God sent Elijah
[1:19:39] gauzy and Elijah down into Israel the
[1:19:41] first year the spirit of Elijah and
[1:19:43] Elijah says there won't be any rain or
[1:19:45] Dew till I call for the whole nation was
[1:19:46] changed amen
[1:19:49] do you understand the significance of
[1:19:52] what God has done for us yes
[1:19:54] don't take it casual don't just leave it
[1:19:57] on the shelf right I meant you this is
[1:20:00] not having a message book or a tape in
[1:20:02] your houses it's not a rosary bead
[1:20:04] religion where I have the I have all the
[1:20:06] paraphernalia therefore I'm going to go
[1:20:08] yeah God wants to take you I mean what
[1:20:12] is influencing you the most because
[1:20:15] you'll become what's influencing you the
[1:20:16] most right you know you take you take
[1:20:25] Hollywood I think I see this before they
[1:20:29] show a camera shot of what they want you
[1:20:31] to see and that's all you see and you
[1:20:34] see the glamour and all the wonderful
[1:20:36] shiny things and all the wealth of you
[1:20:39] know and that captures people's
[1:20:40] imagination and they want to they want
[1:20:43] to become like that but if you just
[1:20:44] turned the camera a little bit you'd see
[1:20:48] the brokenness
[1:20:49] yeah yep and and and and all the drug
[1:20:52] abuse in the broken homes the broken
[1:20:55] people you'd see all the broken the
[1:20:57] destruction that thing creates the devil
[1:21:00] doesn't want to show you that he just
[1:21:01] wants to show you the nice things yes
[1:21:03] amen and then the devil will only want
[1:21:08] to show you the bad things of being a
[1:21:09] believer you say this is what it
[1:21:12] producers know that's not what it
[1:21:13] produces this produces a rapture this
[1:21:16] produces a body change this producers
[1:21:18] are overcoming power now our ambition
[1:21:23] should never to be like should never to
[1:21:26] be like the world now Satan came to
[1:21:28] Jesus in the wilderness and the hour of
[1:21:30] his great temptation and he said if thou
[1:21:32] bow down and worship me he showed him
[1:21:35] all the kingdoms of the world this is a
[1:21:37] matthew 4 and 8 again the devil take him
[1:21:39] up to an exceeding high mountain and
[1:21:41] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[1:21:42] and the glory of them and said unto him
[1:21:45] all these things will I give thee if
[1:21:47] thou will fall down and worship Me then
[1:21:50] said Jesus unto Him get the hint Satan
[1:21:52] fer is written thou shalt worship the
[1:21:54] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[1:21:57] serve so the devil offered Jesus the
[1:22:00] kingdoms of the world he offered him the
[1:22:03] kingdoms of the world but he offered him
[1:22:06] in such a way that it was that he was
[1:22:09] going to give it to him but Jesus said
[1:22:11] no get hints because I'm going to buy it
[1:22:13] I mean I'm going to redeem I'm going to
[1:22:16] purchase the world by my blood so the
[1:22:18] kingdoms of man will become the kingdoms
[1:22:20] of God and and God in his mind was never
[1:22:23] just to let the world continue as it was
[1:22:26] but if but if Jesus worship Satan - to
[1:22:30] receive all the kingdoms of the world
[1:22:32] they would just continued on but in
[1:22:34] God's mind he didn't see civilization
[1:22:36] this way and the new heavens and new
[1:22:38] earth it is not like this I say praise
[1:22:41] the Lord Amen so he was offering him a
[1:22:45] kingdom and it's the same thing with the
[1:22:48] devil the devil will offer you a kingdom
[1:22:50] he will offer you you could just be have
[1:22:53] or have a very small realm of a you know
[1:22:56] you just you could just be promoted to a
[1:22:58] certain job right or it'll just be a
[1:23:01] kingdom over
[1:23:02] but he will offer you some kind of
[1:23:04] kingdom if you will just sell your gift
[1:23:07] to him they meant but now we are not
[1:23:11] called to run Satan's Kingdom
[1:23:15] we are kings and priests to God so that
[1:23:18] means we have a Dominion we have a we
[1:23:21] have a rulership over God's kingdom or
[1:23:24] in God's kingdom
[1:23:26] so now Jesus knew that he had to die to
[1:23:30] redeem the kingdom know that this world
[1:23:32] to become the ruler of it and Satan will
[1:23:36] give you a kingdom without a birth yeah
[1:23:39] I mean without a death right because you
[1:23:42] have to die as well you follow me you
[1:23:44] have to die as well to receive a
[1:23:46] Dominion I meant but he will give you
[1:23:49] everything he can just without you dying
[1:23:51] because unless a man be born again he
[1:23:54] cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:23:56] so Satan will offer you this world if he
[1:23:59] can just to keep you from meeting God
[1:24:02] amen and so he will offer you he will
[1:24:07] give you this message without a birth he
[1:24:11] will that pulse it though I understand
[1:24:13] all mysteries though I heal the second
[1:24:16] race it did have faith to move mountains
[1:24:17] if I have not charity which is divine
[1:24:20] love I have nothing I mean so he will
[1:24:22] offer you this message without a real
[1:24:24] birth but there has to be a death amen
[1:24:29] that's it's vital you have to be born
[1:24:33] again they say well that's all very
[1:24:35] elementary no it's not element oh it is
[1:24:38] it is vital amen amen
[1:24:40] yes sir now Jesus said that he would he
[1:24:46] had to redeem the world in order to to
[1:24:49] receive the kingdoms of this world now
[1:24:53] the new heavens and new earth is not
[1:24:56] everything's totally annihilated and God
[1:24:58] makes new ones and that way but it's a
[1:25:00] renovation of what's already here
[1:25:02] because then because the New Jerusalem
[1:25:05] is going to sit upon this earth when we
[1:25:07] are in eternity we're going to be
[1:25:09] walking upon this earth
[1:25:12] amen and so it's just like in second
[1:25:14] Peter 3 and 10 but the day the Lord will
[1:25:16] come as a thief in the night and which
[1:25:18] the heavens shall pass away which means
[1:25:21] change with a great noise and the
[1:25:22] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:25:24] the earth also in the works are and
[1:25:26] shall be burned up seeing then that all
[1:25:28] these things shall be dissolved what
[1:25:30] manner of persons ought we to be in all
[1:25:32] holy conversation and godliness looking
[1:25:35] forward hasting unto the coming of the
[1:25:37] day of God wherein the heavens being on
[1:25:41] fire shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:25:42] shall melt with fervent heat
[1:25:44] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:25:46] look for the new heavens and new earth
[1:25:48] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:25:50] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[1:25:53] for such things be diligent that you may
[1:25:56] be found of him and peace without spot
[1:25:58] and blameless now this word you hear and
[1:26:01] the Greek it actually means a freshness
[1:26:04] which is actually with which is in
[1:26:06] respect to age shall be made new again
[1:26:09] as and young again right it doesn't mean
[1:26:12] a new one isn't as a new buy a new car
[1:26:14] and you get rid of the old car that two
[1:26:16] different cars
[1:26:16] it's a renovation or making you or
[1:26:19] making young of what's already here
[1:26:21] we're going to walk here the streets of
[1:26:23] gold are here are going to be here yeah
[1:26:25] amen hallelujah
[1:26:28] so he will give you don't take Satan's
[1:26:32] cheap gimmick yes I mean whatever you do
[1:26:38] now to receive the kingdom of God is far
[1:26:41] greater than to receive a Dominion upon
[1:26:43] this world by Satan see my hero as I
[1:26:46] said is not some Sportster now I know we
[1:26:49] did a lot of work yesterday but be with

[1:27:06] to see him and be in the Millenium and
[1:27:08] have new bodies and we were getting
[1:27:11] excited
[1:27:11] Amen I mean we we were getting excited
[1:27:14] because it's a reality
[1:27:16] hallelujah but the greatest thing about
[1:27:18] that is I'm going to see him as he is a
[1:27:20] man because he is my hero
[1:27:23] Eliot my hero is not someone who who
[1:27:25] doesn't incredible whatever in sport of
[1:27:28] this world my hero walks to a grave of
[1:27:30] his friend that's been dead for days
[1:27:32] and your speaks his name it says come
[1:27:34] forth and and that body that was
[1:27:36] decaying and corrupt it comes back and

[1:28:45] hallelujah he is my sacrifice now we're
[1:28:48] going to come to the two two birds soon
[1:28:49] okay but here's this is what this is my
[1:28:53] hero this is the one I idolized God
[1:28:56] himself
[1:28:57] Hey hallelujah now brother Brown would
[1:29:02] say that those in Jesus Christ the same
[1:29:05] y'all googled uh um you know the
[1:29:08] weakness of Christians now because our
[1:29:10] hero because heroes in the world they
[1:29:12] say I'm up here you can't become like me
[1:29:15] you'll never be as good as me you know
[1:29:18] people always debate what was the best
[1:29:19] rugby team and you know what era and
[1:29:21] stuff yeah because they say no these
[1:29:23] ones are better but my hero became lower
[1:29:26] than me to lift me up to where he was
[1:29:29] and he demonstrate
[1:29:30] it is power to show that the weakest of
[1:29:33] Christians can use the same weapon that
[1:29:35] he used to defeat Satan amen and it will
[1:29:38] defeat him so it doesn't matter how
[1:29:40] strong you think you are or how weak you
[1:29:42] think you are I mean but you have a
[1:29:44] god-given authority to use the same
[1:29:46] weapon that he did hallelujah so don't
[1:29:50] look at how how forget about how you
[1:29:53] feel your walkers do it just forget
[1:29:56] about it and just take I'll just read
[1:29:58] this Jesus Christ the same now when you
[1:30:01] go home this week study this where I'm
[1:30:03] going to quote from you just now because
[1:30:07] time won't permit me to read it all
[1:30:08] about next 10 minutes now notice when
[1:30:10] Jesus was here on earth this is my hero
[1:30:12] after he received the Father and to
[1:30:14] himself well we truly believe I am sure
[1:30:16] you southern people here believe that
[1:30:18] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:30:20] to himself that he was divine and lady
[1:30:24] sometimes said to me he was just a
[1:30:25] prophet well if he's just a prophet rule
[1:30:27] lost he was deity God manifests in the
[1:30:30] flesh absolutely nothing less and
[1:30:32] Jehovah dwelling in a body his own son
[1:30:34] there by his great will he created a
[1:30:38] tabernacle a body virgin born that he
[1:30:40] lived it to express himself to the world
[1:30:43] through that body now we find him as
[1:30:45] soon as God came upon him he was
[1:30:48] anointed went into the wilderness and
[1:30:50] and out after 40 days defeated Satan by
[1:30:54] the Word of God what did he do he
[1:30:56] brought any divine promise and reach of
[1:30:59] the weakest of Christians any man I mean
[1:31:02] he brought every day he says any but
[1:31:04] I'll say every divine promise he brought
[1:31:07] it down to the weakest of believer
[1:31:09] that's right so it doesn't matter if
[1:31:11] you're feeling weak every divine
[1:31:14] promises have been brought down within
[1:31:16] your reach hallelujah
[1:31:19] if he was God why did he let Satan say
[1:31:22] if thou be the Son of God perform a
[1:31:24] miracle here and show me you can do it
[1:31:26] turn these stones into bread neatly see
[1:31:28] that's written man shall not live by
[1:31:30] bread alone so in a Satan always tries
[1:31:33] to coat the word went back and told him
[1:31:35] when he put him on a pinnacle of the
[1:31:37] temple of Genesis it's written
[1:31:39] he defeated Satan on the Word of God
[1:31:41] this is God's covenant with Abraham and
[1:31:44] his seed in 56 and he said it's also
[1:31:46] written a man and he took the father's
[1:31:48] word and defeated Satan right on his
[1:31:50] ground what did he do he was proving to

[1:34:21] who was very young he is very influenced
[1:34:23] it says in Philippians three and eight
[1:34:25] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[1:34:28] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:34:30] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:34:33] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:34:35] count them but dung that I may win

[1:34:41] everything in life but time that you
[1:34:43] might win Christ amen you can't take you
[1:34:46] can't take your old life with you my
[1:34:48] brother Brown tells the story of the
[1:34:49] wise men going from the east to you got
[1:34:52] to find the you know find Jesus had been
[1:34:54] born and he dramatizes yo they're
[1:34:56] packing their camels and a guy puts his
[1:34:58] card table up there and he puts his
[1:35:00] whiskey drinks and all these different
[1:35:02] things and the cattle begins to buckle
[1:35:03] under the weight and then he realizes I
[1:35:06] can't take this with me because they
[1:35:07] throw up all the stuff he doesn't need
[1:35:08] and then then the other wise missus what
[1:35:11] are you doing he says I'm laying aside
[1:35:12] every weight and sin that so easily
[1:35:14] beset me because I'm going to run hey

[1:35:23] dung Amen if the Apostle Paul who was up
[1:35:26] to here in religion yeah you talk about
[1:35:29] dedicated man before he met the Lord
[1:35:31] he's dedicated
[1:35:33] he's a Pharisee of the Pharisees that's
[1:35:35] not just a you know amateur-hour kind of
[1:35:39] walk he was dedicated his whole life was
[1:35:42] was was directed of that but he counted
[1:35:45] that but dung Amen Alleluia how about
[1:35:48] you oh my Amen now and be found in him
[1:35:52] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:35:54] of the law but that which is through the
[1:35:56] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[1:35:58] is of God by by faith that I may know
[1:36:01] him in the power of his resurrection and
[1:36:03] the Fellowship of his sufferings being
[1:36:05] made conformable
[1:36:06] unto his death if by any means I might
[1:36:09] obtain unto the resurrection of the Dead
[1:36:11] not as though I have already obtained
[1:36:13] either we're already perfect but I
[1:36:16] follow after that if that I may
[1:36:19] apprehend that for which also I'm every
[1:36:22] headed of Christ Jesus and in brethren I
[1:36:25] count not myself to be a pre I me to
[1:36:28] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:36:30] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:36:32] so forget the past move on I mean forget
[1:36:36] the past and move on
[1:36:37] amen and reaching forth unto those
[1:36:39] things which are before I pressed
[1:36:42] towards the mark of the prize of the
[1:36:43] high calling of God in Christ Jesus let
[1:36:46] us therefore as many as be perfect be
[1:36:48] dust minded and if in anything we are
[1:36:51] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[1:36:54] this to you amen so Paul saying let this
[1:36:57] mind be in you hallelujah so here was
[1:37:00] the man who he was lifted up he said
[1:37:03] unto the third heavens and he saw things
[1:37:05] and things of spoken to him was so
[1:37:07] incredible he couldn't speak about it
[1:37:09] for about 15 years
[1:37:10] he says lest I being lifted above the
[1:37:13] revelation that I have received I mean
[1:37:15] he received a thought yo-yo a thorn of
[1:37:17] yo Satan to buffer him to keep him
[1:37:19] humble here was a man he says the
[1:37:22] dispensation of the gospel has been
[1:37:24] given to me you know when Paul was
[1:37:26] writing the New Testament he didn't just
[1:37:28] study it like many people study the
[1:37:30] Bible today and look at and look in the
[1:37:32] Old Testament all this sounds pretty
[1:37:34] neat this kind of relates and then old
[1:37:35] you know write a letter he received
[1:37:37] divine inspiration a mint you know he
[1:37:41] received divine inspiration and he
[1:37:43] pinned it down he sent it to the
[1:37:44] churches he God took the gift in his
[1:37:47] life and he any any place law and grace
[1:37:49] exactly how it should it be here was it
[1:37:53] was the Apostle Paul but he says that I
[1:37:55] want to ever ahead that which is that
[1:37:58] has apprehended me amen so he saw Jesus
[1:38:01] I say he saw him run we've all been
[1:38:04] influenced you've seen someone run 100 I
[1:38:06] want to be come back you know where you
[1:38:08] see your favorite team win and then you
[1:38:10] look yo you know it's like you know when
[1:38:12] the All Blacks wouldn't it heaps of more
[1:38:13] kids start playing rugby because they
[1:38:16] get influenced by I mean so he saw he
[1:38:19] saw geez
[1:38:19] run and he wanted to and he said now
[1:38:23] that thing I want apprehend amen and I
[1:38:27] trust it's the same with you today you
[1:38:31] say well what does this got to do with
[1:38:33] us we're sitting at the end of all
[1:38:36] things the rapture could go just now Amy
[1:38:38] we have we have a part of this race to
[1:38:41] run
[1:38:42] Amy right we are to live another book of
[1:38:44] Acts yep we are not just here sitting
[1:38:48] back on the laurels and and the
[1:38:50] victories of yesteryear that's right
[1:38:52] right we're not called just to sit back
[1:38:54] and just to enjoy all the blessings that
[1:38:56] are being passed down from Calvary to
[1:38:57] now there's no where where to take what
[1:39:00] we have received and where to run with
[1:39:02] it Amy a way to influence those around
[1:39:04] us yes Alleluia now you take let's go
[1:39:08] back to Leviticus 14 again now these two
[1:39:12] birds that you know one was killed and
[1:39:14] the blood of blood of thee your your the
[1:39:18] blood of one the live one was dipped in
[1:39:20] it with hassel and cedarwood and scarlet
[1:39:22] and and and and hyssop they had to be
[1:39:26] the same kind of birth it wasn't a
[1:39:28] wasn't a turkey and a vulture or a
[1:39:30] turkey and a dove there were two doves
[1:39:32] yeah right and so the blood now now you
[1:39:35] just think about you just think about a
[1:39:38] live one yeah it would have been an
[1:39:40] incredible experience to be grabbed put
[1:39:43] into you know and and to be dipped in
[1:39:45] the blood of you did mate just think
[1:39:47] about this and then you're released into
[1:39:50] a into an open field so now the life
[1:39:53] that was once pulsating in your mate now
[1:39:55] is upon you and because the blood that
[1:39:57] was and the dead one now goes in a live
[1:40:00] one and in that live one takes the blood
[1:40:02] that was shed out into the world and so
[1:40:06] here we are this is the only way you can
[1:40:08] run as when the life of the Dead mate
[1:40:11] Jesus Christ comes into you by his word
[1:40:14] amen and then the power of that blood
[1:40:16] that was shed now you spread it upon the
[1:40:19] earth
[1:40:19] oddly imagine singing Bertha's dripping
[1:40:21] with blood flood you don't get your
[1:40:23] attention amen and should be the same
[1:40:26] thing with you and I the life that is
[1:40:28] within us I'm in the life that was
[1:40:30] within us amen
[1:40:31] should should be should be so visible
[1:40:34] and our character how we conduct
[1:40:35] ourselves
[1:40:36] I mean how we treat other people they
[1:40:39] should see something is different about
[1:40:41] these people I admit it's because now
[1:40:43] that same God that was in Jesus Christ
[1:40:45] out empties himself into the church
[1:40:48] because God's work is completed through
[1:40:52] his body right his workers plan of
[1:40:55] redemption is completed through you well
[1:40:58] does that mean I have to die no you
[1:41:00] don't have to die because he maybe he
[1:41:02] purchased our salvation but then he did
[1:41:05] to the disciples go into all the world
[1:41:07] preach the gospel why is that because
[1:41:09] what was done there in Jerusalem has to
[1:41:12] spread about upon the whole earth and
[1:41:13] how is God going to do it through his
[1:41:16] body or through the living mate that the
[1:41:18] blood has been dip I mean has been put
[1:41:20] upon yeah
[1:41:22] so all the healing all the salvation
[1:41:25] amen Redemption the power of the blood
[1:41:28] comes unto you I mean now remember we
[1:41:31] still have a bloody sacrifice at the 3rd
[1:41:33] of God and when and we will meet him in
[1:41:35] the air amen but the life that was
[1:41:38] released on Calvary from that blood
[1:41:39] comes into the believer and then we go
[1:41:42] out into the world amen Hey hallelujah
[1:41:46] slightly and so this is this is what
[1:41:51] we're cool to be hello let that now let
[1:41:58] that imagination grip you that God
[1:42:00] Himself could step down
[1:42:01] I'm really trying to preach to the kids
[1:42:03] I want to get all your attention amen
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:07] because God if God could speak to Samuel
[1:42:09] and use him to change a nation God can
[1:42:12] speak to you and you can change this
[1:42:14] world you're never too young hallelujah
[1:42:17] never too old either
[1:42:19] a marry me Alleluia God wants to use us
[1:42:22] to shake this world now let's go to
[1:42:25] revelations 19 and 1 I just want to read
[1:42:29] this
[1:42:32] now it says revelations 19 to 1 after
[1:42:37] these things which is the destruction of
[1:42:39] of the to Babylon so is the destruction
[1:42:42] of Rome destruction of Los Angeles going
[1:42:45] into the city I mean I mean into the
[1:42:46] Seekers once burn with fire never ones
[1:42:48] like a millstone thrown into the sea
[1:42:50] slides in after these things I heard a
[1:42:53] great voice I just say one thing what
[1:42:56] you're feeding on you know your your we
[1:42:59] are reflecting other two worlds you're
[1:43:02] either a reflection of heaven oh you're
[1:43:05] a reflection of hell and it's what
[1:43:08] you're feeding on shows really where
[1:43:11] your sweet where your treasures are laid
[1:43:12] up a mess I mean so if your treasures
[1:43:15] are laid up upon this world and
[1:43:16] entertainment could be sport it could be
[1:43:18] chasing the dollar could be chasing some
[1:43:20] image of some successful person could be
[1:43:23] anything of that if you're chasing those
[1:43:24] things your treasures are upon the earth
[1:43:26] that's right and that now is going to
[1:43:29] perish I meant where your treasures are
[1:43:32] laid up that's where your heart is you
[1:43:34] know believe it how can how can yo God
[1:43:39] takes us just as we are but we've got to
[1:43:41] come through his provided way otherwise
[1:43:43] there'd be all kinds of spirits in
[1:43:44] heaven yeah revelations 91 and after
[1:43:47] these things I heard a great voice of
[1:43:49] much people in heaven saying Alleluia
[1:43:51] salvation and glory and honor and power
[1:43:54] and the Lord our God for true and
[1:43:56] righteous are his judgments for he hath
[1:43:58] judged the great which they commit
[1:44:00] Krupp the earth with her fornication and
[1:44:03] hath avenged the blood of his servants
[1:44:05] at her hand and again they said Alleluia
[1:44:08] and a smoke rose up forever and ever and
[1:44:10] the four and twenty elders and the four
[1:44:12] beasts fell down and worshipped God that
[1:44:14] said on the throne saying amen Alleluia
[1:44:16] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:44:18] saying praise our God all ye his
[1:44:20] servants and you that fear Him both
[1:44:22] small and great and I heard as it were a
[1:44:24] great were the voice of a great
[1:44:27] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:44:29] waters and as the voice of mighty
[1:44:31] thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord

[1:44:46] scripture and for her and to her was
[1:44:48] granted she should be arrayed in fine
[1:44:50] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[1:44:52] is the righteousness of saints and he
[1:44:55] saith unto me write blessed are they
[1:44:58] which are called unto the marriage
[1:44:59] supper of the Lamb
[1:45:00] hello blessed people and he said unto me
[1:45:03] these are the true sayings of God and I
[1:45:06] fell at his feet to worship Him and he
[1:45:08] said unto me si doubt not I'm our fellow
[1:45:11] servant and of thy brethren that have
[1:45:14] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1:45:17] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:45:19] prophecy so now there's a great
[1:45:21] multitude in heaven and as the voice of
[1:45:24] many waters and the voice of mighty
[1:45:26] thunderings saying I'll Lou you for the

[1:48:30] because it's word said so and only the
[1:48:32] righteous will be there he'll prove it
[1:48:34] too that's right only the ones that's

[1:49:19] the head off one and turn it upside down
[1:49:21] poured the blood upon the living mate
[1:49:23] and turn the mate loose and the mate
[1:49:25] sprinkled it with the blood of the Dead

[1:54:12] just some nice peaceful place like we
[1:54:14] think yeah it's far greater heaven is
[1:54:16] far greater than even the nicest place

[1:54:23] just being in a camp atmospheres only
[1:54:24] believers around that's what it's a spa

[1:57:27] to be part of the greatest event since

[1:57:49] sweet come over the church
[1:57:51] here we are before you realize what will
[1:57:55] be you'll be a lot younger before you

[1:58:04] well if I going to do anything the Lord
[1:58:05] I better do it now the voice said you
[1:58:08] want to see parts occurred in the time
[1:58:09] Oh
[1:58:10] before he knew he was there he was there
[1:58:12] that's right
[1:58:13] before he realizes he know what's going
[1:58:15] on my buddies he did he was taken before
[1:58:18] you even realize amen and that friends
[1:58:23] it's a reason that that that happened in
[1:58:26] his ministry because because God wanted
[1:58:28] us to know it's more real than this
[1:58:30] world it's greater than the best day of
[1:58:32] your life that you've ever had times of
[1:58:35] bye Billy and it's still greater than oh
[1:58:36] and all the hardship and the sacrifice
[1:58:39] and the and the traveling and the prayer
[1:58:42] and the you know and the rejection by
[1:58:44] people and the being misunderstood by
[1:58:46] people of all the things all the
[1:58:49] approach will not mean a single foot Hey
[1:58:53] amen
[1:58:54] it will be worth it all do we have that
[1:58:57] we don't have this I'm doing it do we
[1:58:59] noticing it it will be worth it all when
[1:59:03] we see Jesus okay I promise you it it's
[1:59:10] greater than you can imagine
[1:59:14] amen so let's now I think these the
[1:59:17] words of brother Isaac I might I might
[1:59:19] get the koi drop but he said when he
[1:59:21] gets over there he wants to actually you
[1:59:25] could say rest because he's been
[1:59:27] laboring here for the Lord he doesn't
[1:59:29] want to be rested up here and then just
[1:59:30] have another risk amen so I say let us
[1:59:34] work till Jesus comes amen because
[1:59:37] you'll see it in the scripture so
[1:59:39] Matthew 24 25 it goes you know Jesus
[1:59:42] talks about the signs of the end he goes
[1:59:44] to the wise and foolish virgin and that
[1:59:46] page talks about the about the servants
[1:59:49] there is the parable of the servant the
[1:59:52] master goes away and then then the
[1:59:55] servant is in charge things he delays
[1:59:57] his coming he begins to get drunk and
[1:59:59] smite as fellow servants what's that now
[2:00:03] people who lose sight of the Lord
[2:00:06] returning they get drunk with this world
[2:00:08] and then we're going to smite one
[2:00:10] another amen you go read it people who
[2:00:14] lose their vision when I pulled the
[2:00:17] loser version friends amen so a wise
[2:00:20] servant is found doing be found doing
[2:00:23] when he comes the brother man says you
[2:00:25] just keep doing what you're doing until
[2:00:27] he comes to take you away
