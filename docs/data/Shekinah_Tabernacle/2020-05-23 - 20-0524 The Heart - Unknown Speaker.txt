decision that we can have church again I mean so you know I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to seeing everyone here and you know not being over zuman I mean let's go okay so we're in Psalm 17 verse 1 it says here the right o Lord attended to my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of unfeigned lips let my sentence come forth from my presence let thy eyes behold the things that are equal that was proved my heart thou has visited me in the night thou has tried me in shall find nothing I am purpose that my mouth shall not transgress concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips I have I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer hold up my goings in thy paths at my footsteps Slipknot I've called upon thee for thou wilt hear me O God and climb thy ear unto me and hear my speech showed thy marvellous loving-kindness Oh thou that save us by thy right hand them that put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of thine eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppressed me from my deadly enemies who can pass me about they are enclosed in their own fat with their mouths they speak proudly they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places arise oh Lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the Wicked Witch as thy sword for from men which are thy hand O Lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly they'll fill fill us with thy head treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes as for me I will behold thy face and righteousness I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness amen this bow he's in a word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus is truly our hearts desire you'd take us into the holy of Holy's this morning Lord that we'd be in your presence wherever we are today Lord we just longing Lord to feel your presence among us Lord that you'd move on our hearts Lord you would make us more like you Lord you encouraged us Lord increase our faith and Lord just do what only you can do O God Father we we know Lord that anyone can read your word that has been trained to read Lord anyone can read it but Lord it takes you the great author of the book Lord to come Lord and make it live Lord we want to see your word live long I want to see it more than just be a theory or a nice idea but a living reality in our lives so may you grab that for us Lord may you hide us under your wings Lord Jesus Lord forgive us of all of our sins our iniquities our trespasses Lord Father my entire lives be under your blood lord of may lord you come and may you step forth and take the service under your control father our hearts desires to see you live every day so Lord may you live in our lives for your glory Lord we want to commit the service into your hands Lord we pray that you'll not just meet us here in these four walls but wherever Lord your children are gathered around the world on this resurrection morning Lord may you meet with them father Lord may you bless each one oh god bless those who are sick and body as well may you touch them Lord heal them father we think of brother Kira Lord that injured as his foot Lord I pray you'd heal them Lord give them full mobility once again oh god and father this this this pestilence Lord that is that is ravaging the world Lord we know you you told us there would be things in the in the end time but lord I pray

physically healed but Lord you'd move on their hearts and they would seek after you Lord and you draw them Lord that they would receive salvation Oh God father may you grant that I pray and Lord we just commit the service and your hands Lord meet every need for your glory Lord and your wonderful name name Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning and I want to speak about I want to speak about the heart today and I know this is a very big subject but I want to take maybe a bit of it but we from you know from reading the sum we can see David was in a time of great distress he was talking about as enemies are there to to destroy him and to take his life and but we see that you know the Psalms are really your the Psalms to me it wasn't just a theory you know David just wasn't sitting in his palace and thinking of a nice song to sing and how to ride it and the good lyrics and the good you know he wasn't thinking about that but he was experiencing something and and the experience as he is going through in life was actually producing the Psalms so everything that happens in our lives will actually will bring something out of us right and either make us better or make us better amen and it will really bring out what's what's within us you know you know in a time of crisis is really someone's true character really will come out you know where they come under fire or you know people can be yo-yo fills in the military you know there and you know sure anyone can March run on the parade ground and say I'm I'm the best soldier in the unit but it's really when they're in the foxhole and maybe the enemy shooting at them it'll really bring out what's with them then and it's the same thing with us you know we we walk through this life's journey and what is in our hearts comes out you know to me when when David was was saying in that Psalm Lord when you try my heart maybe I'll just find it here he says you know when he says when he says in verse three you know thou has proved my heart thou has visited me in the night that was tried me and shall find nothing now to me he's not saying you're I just avoid heart you know you know we had you know we know the heart is the emotion is the intellect that's you know many many things but you know he's not saying you just find some void zombie right you won't just find an emptiness but what he's saying is that this this word nothing it actually means a failure in the Hebrew ceases when you try me and we since when now has proved my heart it means it means that God has tested us hard and remember when God is God God brings us through something he's not trying to make us look like failures remember all the believers in the scripture you take the Hebrew children they went into their trial they came out victorious right Joshua you know took the land you know David overcame his enemies you know Daniel go through every trial he came out victorious for the trials that came in their lives wasn't actually God trying to trip them up and say see I told you so you know you're useless no God was actually proving what was within them but in a positive way and even when God puts a finger on our lives saying look you're proud you've got this arrogance you've got you you're indifferent whatever it may be when God puts a finger and he wants to take that out of you that his nature can come forth I'll Lou you so it's really all good when we get put through the wringer I mean God is actually you know doing us a favor so so David is saying he says thou shall find nothing that word Mexi means a failure so so when God will precess when God will prove me and try me you know he will not find any failure in his heart I mean I'm sure this is how we all want to be Lord when you try us when you really seek search the depths of our ourselves that only he can he'll find nothing that's a fault I mean so but you know David as are saying he would he would write these songs because something was happening in his life and even the son we we just read you my Bible says it's a prayer of David and you know so so he would he would come under times of great distress you know I you know I love the scripture how you know all of all of David's victories are there but all David's great failures are there you know his you know is his distress has his worry has anguish as trouble you know all the buts no doubt maybe he would say please don't write that down about me they were written down but God would allow that to see that all believers a human way even the scriptures say that Elijah was a man of passions I was just like you and I I mean so they weren't like superstars that were just a beyond and nothing touched him a bother though they were real people and that we threw the ring of the Oh David had many close scrapes in his life and you know but but God you know and and he had great sin in his life - it's amazing when you would you know I don't know if you've hurt anyone's compared the sins of Saul to the sons of David your the sins of David who far outweigh you know now human mind the sins of Saul but yet David David didn't get kicked off the throne because of what he did because God was determined he said no no this is a man after my own heart so it doesn't matter what he's done Amen but because the reason he's a man after his own heart is because he was quick to repent he was quick to say I'm wrong when you're when Nathan the Prophet came in and this was apparently two years after the fact that he had you know Uriah killed he took Bathsheba it was two years after the fact that Nathan came to him and told him the parable of unity or two men and one man had a lot of sheep another man had one sheep and then the rich man who had all the Sheep you know he here to visitor cam come instead of taking one of his own sheep to to killing and AH and an offer for dinner he took the poor man cheap and your David knows he bigoted guru angry and you know yo watch it under this man he should be killed you know then david points a finger i mean Nathan points the finger David you're the man and David thought he got away with it but God saw it why but as soon as as soon as God pointed that out to David I knew what you did he was quick to repent haloo you and we must realize that the zeal of our age when you go to the lady you see in church age it says be zealous and repent I mean so the zeal of our age is actually to repent right to acknowledge when we're wrong not from our heart I mean he sorry not from our mind because it's expected of us like Kelly yo you go to your children say you're sorry you know what do you say now I'm sorry but that's like an expect that it's very different from a heart when they say I'm sorry dad to win I'm sorry dad you know because you know the first one is the one you want to see the second one well that's just expected behavior but expected behavior is not going to produce what we you know it's not going to make the person into a person we want to see right that's the same thing being a believer and it expected behavior is not gonna is not what God is looking for you know sure we have a lot of expected behavior you know just even subliminally there's there's there's expected behavior of how church should be and how we should dress and the things we should say in the yeah but if it's all just an expected learn behavior and not from our heart there's no relationship with God but if it's from our hearts Amen God because God is looking for a people after his own heart just like he said when he when when when samuel was going to to anoint David samuel was told by god i have a king who's a man after my own heart god david was already in that in that condition before Samuel anointed him King and it's the same thing with you and I even before God came by our way he said you know what did he do he he sent a prophet in age to anoint this world you're annoyed this world anoint this age I mean to anoint that people because he was looking for a bride which is after his own heart I mean and we were actually already in that condition I mean before God ever found us I mean but the course there's a lot of things that are being taken out hallelujah right of our hearts but we're already in that condition because he's looking for a part of himself Amen just like Adam and Eve member Eve was part of Adam you know Adam didn't go to Eve world your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life because she is the only other woman there you know you'll do because you're the only one know that death that's not what he was saying he's saying no actually you're part of me we're actually one person I mean what I am you are what you are I am we actually make one whole I mean it's what God comes and found us because actually not a we're part of him right this is what this message is comes through just like Adam telling Eve who she was I mean God comes shows us ourselves in the scripture saying you're bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life you are me hallelujah amen so you know I say you know as I go through these things and and we'll probably only touch maybe the tops and the sides but you know whenever we think of the heart we think oh you know we kind of shell up a bit what's in there you know we all have this humanity we wrestle with and God's got a deal and take things out sure but that doesn't take away our election that doesn't put our salvation in jeopardy right member god say remember he never says to anyone sort your life out and then I'll give you eternal life never did it's just not in Scripture that's not biblical Christianity so your life out now you really know no God takes us washes us carlier seals us into the kingdom and as we walk with Him he sorts our life out right because we're going from glory to glory as we walk with Him with we're becoming more like him I mean but David could stand there you know he could write the Psalms and to me it's incredible because the Psalms were written by a man that God testified testified to to to samuel saying this is a man after my own heart and it's i think it's the only recorder in the scripture where God says this is a man after my own heart but the Psalms are full of David writing about people's hearts he talks about the wicked he talks about the righteous he goes beyond the external and he begins to write about what's inside people and and to me it's amazing because David when he was writing the Psalms he actually experienced what he was writing about when he said their enemies compassing about him there were enemies come Boz ground when he had to when he says there was trouble and things going on there was troubles right and you know the trouble wasn't that dinner was late in the palace you know there was real trouble he was on the run he was you know he had to do a lot of stuff he survived a lot of scrapes right you know so so he experienced what he wrote and we know that any true any true song from God is actually based or you know any any song or or story about God or anything that's expressed as actually based on a revelation causes an experience right you take you know you know you take the song it is well with my soul you know I'm sure we're all familiar with thee with the author of the well well what happened to the author of that of that song you know he didn't just sit there and say well those are cool lyrics you know when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot thou has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul Amy says yo though Satan should Buffett though trials should come let this blest assurance control all that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and has shed his own blood for my soul he didn't just write that because it sounded cool he experienced a lot of hardship remember that that that hardship formed him a certain way there's actually that this song was an expression of everything he went through just like David with the sons now now the man who who wrote the son was his nail song rather is called Horatio Spafford and he had great trauma in his life that led him to writing this thus the song so the first one was was the death of his four-year-old son and the Great Fire of Chicago of 1871 so so so he lost his son there and then he was financially ruined because that fire and it wasn't just that but then but then he planned to travel back to Europe with his family and then Anna late change of plan he sent his family hit of him while he delayed your sorting out business and things following that that Great Chicago Fire but while his family crossed the Atlantic the ship sank rapidly and he lost his four daughters and that in that shipwreck his wife Anna survived and sent him now the famous telegram that said saved alone surely afterwards as expected travel to meet his his grieving wife he was inspired to write these words as a ship passed near where his daughters had died amen he went through great trial he suffered great loss and he suffered that great loss that God would inspire him through that great loss to write it as well with my soul and then now we can stand and sing that song it can mean so much for us because of the hardship I mean I've never lost four daughters I've never lost a son I've never been financially ruined I've never walked in his shoes but because he walked through those great trials I mean we can enjoy a song that was that that that God inspired in his life I mean because because of what happened to him I mean so so to me it's an incredible song because it wasn't written because it sounded cool but because it was an experience just like the Psalms or an experience now it's amazing when you look at the Apostle Paul and we know the Apostle Paul was you know you know he didn't sit in an ivory tower in Jerusalem and and write letters to people you know he doesn't you know yo-yo he wasn't some lofty academic he loved what he experienced and so it's amazing win win win the Apostle Paul sees God allows you to even take the best sermons that that have ever been preached on the earth has been based on an experience that God actually causes you know either the songwriter or the musician or the preacher ever maybe actually to experience a lot of things and then all those experiences God would bring a revelation upon them and then and then it would be preached for I mean you take brother on spin say man he's been through the fire he's been through a lot of hardship I mean but because of those things he can stand and say take courage hallelujah amen he can stand he can preach mighty things because he's been through a lot right it's not an academic theory and so when the Apostle Paul would stand in and-and-and he would write to the Romans and he would say what shall we say into these things if God be for us who can be against us remember he had a lot of opposition both without and within a ment he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay thanks to the charge of God's elect that is God the justifier who is he that condemneth that is Christ that died you'd rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation now remember he went through tribulation or distress he had great distress or persecution he had great persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword he experienced all those things but they can stand there and say no nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ he says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to suppress from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord and because he experienced that he could write it down hallelujah but we can understand it was more than just you know women reading we read the writings of Paul or maybe the Psalms of David or whatever it may be we're not feeding off their intellect we're not just feeding off their experience but God takes her experiences anoints it Amen and uses it for his glory Amy remember that was a revelation to him and now I know this is part one of my favorite pieces of scripture but you know when he would he would write to the Ephesians and and he would begin what we call chapter two of the book of Ephesians he said and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins remember this is not all this is not a mental exercise to him this is not a theory to him he experienced this he knew was like to be quickened we knew his you're on there other on the road to Damascus and you know God came down since it's Lord who are you he was made alive hallelujah he was he was dead in trespasses but he became alive it was an experience amen I mean we're in times past ye walked according to the course of this world hallelujah he he used to do that he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees member doesn't matter what people do outside of Christ they're walking to the course of this world doesn't matter what profession they may take it's not just a drunkard on the street that does that you can be religious and do that I mean so so he knows what that was like according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past cease he's putting himself because he knew what was like I'm in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were pardon me by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus but by grace ye are saved through faith and that is not of yourselves as the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them I meant he knew what I was like he experienced it hallelujah you take the first song that's ever recorded in the scripture it would be written by a man called Moses they just crossed the Red Sea and it was more than just crossing a Red Sea they saw their enemies try and pursue them remember on the other side of the Red Sea there was a lot of distress you know you know you're the people of Israel would even try and turn against Moses and Moses will begin to cry out unto the Lord say lord help us and then God just actually said the Moses way crying just Speaker move forward so there was a lot of distress on that side of the Red Sea but on the other side once they came through the trial and they could look back and see their enemy was drowned and dead Hollyer then then the inspiration struck the prophet and he began to sing a song hallelujah hallelujah it was more than just an intellectual thing it was an experience they had just seen their enemy drowned they'd seen their taskmasters destroyed hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I when we can look into the blood of Jesus Christ and see our sins are gone I mean the things and ones afflict us are being destroyed how they our sins are being eradicated I mean it should give us such a voice I should give us such a praise in our hearts hallelujah that's more than just knowing about Calvary but you've experienced Calvary it's more than just knowing about the blood you've experienced the blood I mean you forgive you you've experienced it's a turning power what it's done for you hallelujah amen so Moses begin to sing cause as a revelation oh yeah it's amazing because in that song he would he would sing about how the horse and the rider are cast into the sea and he would speak about those ones were yo that the Lord is a man of war and you know the Lord is his name and Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts were cast into the sea his chosen captains also drowned in the Red Sea and you know he'd speak about that but then he'd began to prophesy iners in a song saying about the hearts of the kings of Moab would fail anyone and Felicity and all those things and they're going to take the land I mean so it's amazing how how how an experience of what's just happened connects you also predict the vision into the future I mean that if the Lord has brought us thus far we're going to take a body change I mean if the Lord has brought us out of sin and unbelief and all all trouble and many different enemy spirits against us of ward and you know we've been tossed to and fro we've had trouble on every side but yet the Lord's brought us out of everything even if he's brought us out of that I mean we're going to go all the way in hallelujah Amen now there's a massive difference between those who now are probably just repeating myself but here we are there is a massive difference between those who walk with the Lord based upon theory and those who walk with Him upon experience there's a massive difference as I see it between those who preach from theory and those who preach from experience right debate just theory doesn't do it but experience as what what we really need when you know God has done something just like you sing you sing amazing grace before you know the Lord then you sing it after you know the Lord it's a very different song to you because it means the world homey you know that Amazing Grace how sweet the sound they saved the wretch like me know many people unfortunately if they just go on an intellectual Theory alone I mean many people fail and you know sadly but it's those who have an experience as what will really hold you because you know it's true but you've experienced it it's true it's just like you know I'm sure I've used this example before but you know there's a massive difference between learning just like someone who has never driven a car before but they know everything about a car they're literally a walking Wikipedia section on automobiles they know the history they know the development they know every brand that are exactly how all the electronics works how all the gears work how the how the engine works how everything works and even down to a specific model everything but there's a big difference between knowing everything about the car then when you finally get the keys in your hand you open the door you sit in the driver's seat you you put on your belt you know you put the key in the ignition you turn it on you feel the engine turn on for the first time you take the handbrake off going to gear and you begin to drive there's a vast big difference between the two knowing about it and experiencing it hallelujah so you know and it's the same thing you know you can ask that person beforehand what it's like to drive a car and if they're honest I'd say well I don't know but I hear it's like this and they can show you every all the details but they've never really done it but if they're honest they'll say well I've only heard it by seeking hand it's you're seeking hand I yeah I've never experienced it firsthand so you say well but what it's like to drive you say and that's how well I don't know well then you'd find someone who has driven right you'd find someone who's actually driven because then you can actually ask them to say well this is what happened to me when I drove it and it's the same thing when it comes to talking to people about the Lord who's never had the experience right people at you say you're people who say there's nothing about you know there's nothing to receiving the Holy Ghost or there's no really reality if God has just mental workup just a whole bunch of a mental illusion emotional workup it's all on the mind you know God doesn't really heal supernaturally well then the question really is to ask them have they experienced it you know because because if they say well no but I hear this well then you could say well hold on you never actually experienced this didn't you find someone who's really met him because they've experienced it says it goes beyond theory to a reality amen and then those are the people you really want to ask hallelujah now God allowed David to go through incredible things like the summe that the sums would be written so the whole purpose of of all the trials and in David's life is that the Psalms could be written so many times we think remember the Psalms weren't necessary just for David they were for us they're for the believers all through the ages so we can read them in the comfort of our lazy boys or whatever chair we may have you know air-conditioned house everything's just going fine and we can actually draw strength from someone else's hardship because God anointed that hardship God anointed that experience that these would be pinned down that we could draw strength from us I mean and it should be the same way with thing we go through I mean I mean that we that God would allow certain things to happen in our life that God were actually annoyed that experience that it could help someone else hallelujah you know it's amazing when when when David would would write in the psalm some 37 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be only cast down remember David knows what this is like for the lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been young and now I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread so David could look back I don't know how what age we says I was young now I'm older so basically he's looking back on his life he says I've never seen the righteous forsaken and really it feels honest here you actually say I've never seen myself forsaken God was with me when I went down to the Philistine lands God was with me when when the enemy took all of our families you know Zig leg was taken God was with me when I was on the run from Seoul God was with me when epsilon rose up God was with me when all these things were going on the righteous have never been forsaken because he could actually say I've experienced it so he could God could inspire that and write it down hallelujah so that would mean a whole bunch more to him say I've never seen the righteous forsaken hallelujah because he's actually describing and he's talking about himself remember he had his ups and there's downs and it's also when when David would even write the words blesses the man whom God will not impute sin and I said David you take David sins you take Saul sins you think something's not quite right here David did far worse thinks then Saul but David new worlds like to be forgiven he knew what it's like to be found out sure but yours like to repent in you words like to be forgiven even under the blood of bulls and goats he found he found mercy hallelujah how much more now the Bride of Christ under the blood of Jesus Christ amen you know for example you know you know the Psalms you know you know we know a psalm is a song but many of prayers that are written down and and and those those prayers of David you know you're only pray something because you going through it you know you'd never pray for healing if you were well and you knew no one else you know why would I say for example brother Peter David you're perfectly well why would I pray pray on your behalf God heal Peter David he doesn't need it so I wouldn't pray for him in that way or even your own self I'm not if I'm healthy I'm gonna say Lord heal me I need healing no your prayers are based on your experience what you're what you're going through I mean so so David now I know that's very obvious but you know so you don't pray for things that you don't have need of now so so the reason we pray such praises cuz we're facing situations in life now David was inspired to to to pray a certain way because as enemies are after him now the Psalms as I seed so the Psalms were written many times in times of great trouble and anguish heartache worry I mean so really the pressures that they would found himself under cause the Psalms to be written they brought out what was really in David remember the Psalms actually Christ being manifested so all of our hardships and Charles and life is actually for the Lord to display himself in our lives that's the purpose amen so so all of his troubles all of us troubles just cause the Word of God to be manifested in his life remember when we read the Psalms we're not feeding on the mind of a man some now now I'm using brother barons language he says you're not feeding off the mind of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man just saying he not so so when we read the Psalms or when we read Paul's writings or or whoever the author is so for example the first five books of the Bible I'm not I'm not feeding off Moses's mind I'm not reading off his idea it's God inspiring him to pin things down as the same thing with the Psalms I'm not feeding off I'm not drawing comfort from from David's thinking even though he experienced many things and God used those experience to write it down we're feeding off the Word of God amen so so we're not feeding off the mind of a man but we're feeding off the Word of God when we are when we're reading the Psalms or any part of the scripture now you say but I'm not a songwriter I'm not a song not all of us the songwriters not all of us as thing as I say big Amen right there if you want me to flatten a note yeah I'll do that pretty nice but you know so so what's so what I'm saying is we're not all going to become suddenly songwriters because now we've experienced things and God is going to use those right songs no but the Word of God will be manifested in our life it will flow out of us based on our experiences it'll be in different ways but you know it'll come out remember everything in life will either make us better or better and we're not here for ourselves so actually my testimony is not for me though it sure helps me because I can go back to their God you saved me I was lost and undone you found me sure it helps you give me stability because the God that found me there is the same God here today but it's not actually just for me it's all about testimonies are for others that's why we need one another right to to to help one another now our Lord Jesus was called the Rose of Sharon now the Rose of Sharon in order in order to make perfume out of it you take the pedals I think it is and you crush them to get the fragrance out we take power of the flower you got to crush it so so what is contained in the flower can only come and be expressed when it's crushed and it's the same thing that happens in our life what is in us will come out based on the pressure and it will either bring out a religious carnality remember there's many things in our hearts right I'd like that bring out bring out a carnality or it will bring out the life of God amen didn't hear a lot of big a means over the Xoom for that's fine you know you know at will out of our lives for the only way it can come out as if we give it to him you know it's like it's like a person who's who who's planted a garden or tried to plant a garden like I've tried you know you know you you you you get soil you know you put in what you think is there yep this is gonna be a spinach leaves or whatever it was then you find all this other stuff growing there after you water it you know when the conditions get right you find all the stuff that's hidden in the salt begins to grow now you don't beforehand this would be next level if you did but you know no one that I know gets all the soil puts it through a sieve and beforehand knows exactly what every Cedars and takes out all the weeds how do they get the weeds out they allow them to grow then they pull them out it's the same thing it's the same thing even now lives these things buried in us that God wants to take out and has you look he allows the water to come the Holy Spirit to come down things begin to grow membrillo and then and then if there's a weed like like pride or you know being arrogant or or unforgiving spirit or whatever it may be you can't you know you're detached or condescending whatever it may be some negative part of a character God allows those things that come forth that when you see it you're shocked I trust we all are you know we're shocked by I can't believe I just reacted that way you know you say Lord I take it out of my life I meant and when you really give it to him then he begins to pull it out hallelujah but then you find yourself overcoming as you're going along remember God doesn't allow trials for us to fail he doesn't set us up to fail he sets us up to overcome he wants to give us victory hallelujah remember we are already victorious member David David's fail is did not make him not King anymore Amy remember there's the sure mercies of David and we're living under the short mercies of David today right so his failures didn't get him kicked off the throne sure he Heat you're here to pay for those those sends all those things but didn't mean he wasn't a man after God's own heart he remember God knew he would fall with Bathsheba God knew he would do all God knew he had number the people even before he was a shepherd boy God knew he was king right God knew exactly what he would do in his life but God didn't change his opinion about him it's the same thing with us God knows what we're gonna do tomorrow God knows what we're thinking right now God knows what we're going to do next week all the way up to the body change God knows we're going to have great victory and God knows we're going to fall on our face right and God knows we're going to be trouble in our spirit say Lord why have I got this kind of personality God knows all those things but God doesn't change your mark change his mind he can't mimic God can't change his mind he made up his mind not like we do remember our minds change based on evidence right how am I intend you saw so initially I could say this is the best phone in the world but then I just go and Google I find out actually it's a few years old now it's not the best so my opinion of the phone would change right but if I was God I'd say no this is the best phone in the world and I can't change my mind and that's a very crude illustration to be known I mean so so just like us God doesn't say oh you're wonderful one day and say no I just can't work with you the next day God says no you're the apple of my eye I mean you're hidden under my wings you're part of me Amen you're you're you're my wife I love you I've given my life you I've I've redeemed you you're part of me you got to be up there in the wedding supper he already sees us there right he's just waiting for it to be fulfilled just like an artist and their mind they see someone who's who's a great painter I mean they see that I work in their mind you know and a great artist can actually transfer what they see to canvas most of us cannot this seems to be some kind of blockage that you can't transfer it exactly you know but a great artist can write just like God he sees in his mind us redeem ground the throne made in His image cast our crowns at his feet or whatever he's seeing member because he's outside of time but now in time it's being drawn in canvas right and it's and it's finally and I believe we're living in the day when he looks down at us and says I see myself so much in these people remember by the blood of Jesus Christ he does by the Holy Ghost he does and then he and then any Hill he looked down at his bride say I can't stand being separated from them any longer come up home my beloved arise my fair one come away with me hallelujah Amen so now the devil has only a tool in God's hand what understand this the devil is only a tool in God's hand I mean Isaiah would write in Isaiah 54 and verse 14 and righteousness thou shall be established thou shall be far from oppression he's talking about me he's talking about you remember in righteousness we shall be established the righteousness of Christ himself we are established I mean thou shalt be far from oppression thou shall not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee remember as like the scripture there be a time of trouble this world will not be free of trouble but will be free from trouble why because we're heading in the cleft of the rock amen behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake so the devil's are gathering all of hell's emptied upon the earth they're gathering but not by not by the Lord why but all those that come against thee they shall fall for thy sake amen that's why the devil comes against you you know David were right in Psalms 27 he says when my enemies came up to you know came against me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell once upon a time the devil come against us and we stumbled and fell but then now anew you're the strong man of the house came in Christ Himself came in and then when the devil comes against you and he thinks well I'm just going to defeat you like it at the other time no the tide has turned and now he stumbles and falls at your feet I mean just like Shem gay man he was there and and and and harvest after harvest the enemy would come and and they would take the crop and they would take you know you're taking all the way and basically his family would be left starving but one season when Shamgar brother bran would dramatize it he says he looked into the eyes of his children he looked into the eyes of his wife and he saw their condition and he began to hear the Philistines marching up the road to - to get his harvest and something awoke in he realized that he was the son of Abraham I mean he recognized here's a circumcised son of Abraham and brother and says that was enough right and he took his ox God jumped out the window through the door and he killed six hundred Philistines because he recognized who he was remember the Ox God didn't make him an overcomer Eliot nothing made him an overcomer just the realization of who he already was and it's the same thing in this our friends the Bride of Christ I'm looking at you on the internet here and I believe we were working to realize who we are I mean that is that it is not our lot in life that the devil comes and takes what he wants goes out that's not our lot in life a lot in life as the devil comes in any false hallelujah and and he is defeated Amen so that's why we should never remember when God is saying when God is looking for a people after his own heart we've got to recognize we do not become that we already are that David already was a man after God's own heart I mean he didn't become that by evening the anointing coming on his head he already was that hallelujah but the anointing just to work and what he what he was meant to be I mean that's the same thing with you and I remember we are the bride is the people after God's own heart irrespective of our failures and our humanity just like David Mamet David mimicked God didn't say he's a perfect you know he's a man after my own heart then you see David never puts a foot wrong never does nothing bad and and we try and put ourselves up in that kind of category and then we fall and we wonder why this because God saying actually you're putting yourself with it you're still human I know you still have human weakness you're still in these bodies that's why I think the greatest shout that's ever going to ring in this world is going to be when these bodies are changed father lujah that's going to be the greatest thing and the older we get the more we want them change not just because of all they just sitting in because you realize you know you realize your own failures in your own limitations the only things that frustrate you more and more you know but hallelujah it's gonna be the greatest shout it's going to be the greatest shot that's going to ring hallelujah amen now where have I gone oh yes we're still in the Isaiah 54 behold I have created the Smith to blot the calls in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the wasted to destroy so God saying I made the waster to destroy but then the next verse is saying no weapon formed against thee shall prosper so God is saying I'll form someone I've created the war you know when you create something you form it right she's saying I have created the wasted to destroy he could actually say I have formed the the wasted to destroy but there no weapon formed against thee shall prosper so the devil that's formed against he he's not going to prosper man but all he does is actually bring out the Lord in your life you know the devil did the greatest favor to God in the Garden of Eden mimic God knew that there be a fall right but but before the fall you know remember God he has all these attributes he's a redeemer he's a savior he's a guide he's a husband he's a comforter you know he's a shepherd he's a high priest he's a sacrifice you know he's an atonement he's a peacemaker he's an advocate he's all these incredible things Adam and Eve didn't know him as that they knew him as father as creator I don't know as God that's it so so God was actually limited was limited he couldn't express maybe God God made us because he wants to express himself wants to reveal himself he wants a people that's drawn close to him he can walk with in life and reveal this character show who he is to them individually to us that's what he wants to do but he couldn't do that in fullness with Adam and Eve in the garden he couldn't do it he couldn't he concur them so Adam I'm your Redeemer I'd have never been lost Adam I'm your Savior I'd have never been lost uh I'm your healer Adam by by my stripes you're healed he'd never been sick hey I'm your comforter Adam he'd never need a comforting I'm your guide he'd never need a guiding you know all these all these things attributes I'm your advocate he never Adam never needed someone to work on his behalf you know we have the best legal team in the world in the universe hallelujah you know everyone it won a big court case they try to see the best lawyers they can get men our judge became our attorney the case got thrown out hallelujah but we had the best legal team in the whole universe hallelujah I mean so so God had all these attributes and our bottle of he couldn't express them but now the devil comes along and thinks he's pulling one over God know all all the devil did was actually unleash God upon humanity hallelujah you know remember he wasn't a Savior but then he became a savior imagine Megan stano's Adam and Eve you've never been scared before but now you're scared you're now standing in the presence of the one you loved and now you're afraid to be in his presence but then he gives a promise of the seed of the woman and he not he see basically a man's gonna come and undo all this he's gonna crush the head of the seed of the serpent and he doesn't only just give him a promise he takes some lambskins wraps his children and these lambskins as a as a as a token or an evidence and he has to take them out of the garden but imagine that you're a condemned he says no no this is going to be undone and then when they may be built their first altar when they walked out of Eden they could say Lord your arrow you're our Savior you're our sin offering you're our lamb they could never do that before but now they could do it and that's why I say we're the most privileged people in all the world the world is so dark but it's so light never has the people needed guiding like we do never has the people needed comfort from the Lord as we do in this hour even when the Prophet would would would look and he would say well I can't he says he just predicted he didn't prophesy cease I just predict everything's be done by 1977 he couldn't see past and I was so dark but then even in this darkness wish still walking in this darkness but he'd say no don't matter how dark it gets children there's light oh it's just so even and that when the Prophet couldn't see where we're living in 2020 I mean got us to walk with his children in this great darkness he says gross darkness would cover the people I mean but the glory the lord has risen upon me I mean so never before as the people needed light like we need it never before if we needed an advocate like we need it never ever people needed a blood like we need it or a guide or a comforter I mean there's so much trouble on every hand but yet we can stand in perfect peace saying my gods gutless I mean the Lord teaches us godless he's got our lives he's in control I mean we don't need to worry what we may face God says I've got this hallelujah I mean so you know and that's why I'm sorry thankful Lord I can walk with you you're my guide you're my comfort I mean you're my peace I mean you're my joy you're my satisfying portion I mean you're my blood you're my high priests you're my advocate you're my all and all God hallelujah Lord Jesus isn't that wonderful babies I'm so thankful that we're walking now as opposed member we're going back to before the garden because God is making us in a way that we can never fall he's putting us some bodies that we can never fall so we're going back before even before Adam and Eve were in that condition we're going to a better one hallelujah amen now hallelujah so no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper no devil will prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shall condemn remember the devil comes against you tries to condemn you so hold on hold on hold on you know you gotta actually you know winning you know when he gets the talking stick he just goes you know tell her shut up shut up devil hold on and God's court of law I'm righteous I'm righteous remember someone is going to have to give an account you know the great white throne judgment is just going to be like the Garden of Eden judgment there but on a massive scale and it'll there's just my thinking it will just boil down who did this because wind from Adam to Eve to the serpent so it's going to go to who did this in a boil down ball down ball down and where's all the Sun going to go it's going to land up on one person his name's Lucifer and there's no wriggle room for him and he will actually pay for the sins that that that were should have been attributed to us brother Brahim says that the blood actually transfers the sin on to him onto the head of the accuser so the head now elsens that we're a lot of twists but by the blood Jesus Christ we will wipe clean now there on the head of the accuser and now he will have to give an account I mean for every single thing that's happened in this world he will have to give an account and he can't pass the buck actually not it's just urine on him I mean so what a blood render so now so now every ton that shall rise against you in judgment thou shalt condemn you say Satan hell was created for the - you and your angels that was created for you the new heaven and new earth was created for the Bride of Christ that's for me Amen so you have your allotted place that you're going and I don't know how long you'll be in there I'm not worried but you will cease to be there will be a time where the devil will never be even I don't even think of memory even even you take in the scripture the you know in the Old Testament about the scapegoat you know how one goat was killed I believe it is that they took the blood they put it on the other or something or they put all the sins on the other goat and they lean it out into the wilderness and it was just released and that was like the sin was now put sin of the people was put on that goat and it was taken out into the wilderness now that that scapegoat is not the devil because there because if it was then the devil would have part in our Redemption he got no part remember our Lord Jesus was our scapegoat he died on Calvary with our sin upon him right and he was taken he was actually put into you could say into a wilderness he took our sins down into hell on our behalf you take you take a you know you know in the in the Middle East in your Eastern countries they don't ship it like we do we you know we ship it cheap with dogs and whistles and you know you know that's how we herd sheep but they're they call them by name they know them right so in order for a scapegoat to be led down to wilderness and then and then the and then the you know the person actually get away from that goat the leader of that God actually would have to hide their face from the scapegoat there's like the father he say hid his face from from the son see it was a scapegoat being led into the wilderness by someone who he couldn't even see who he was and there's just released and now he's in a place he's never been before and now all the hounds all the walls all the Predators now can get that goat and it's not on where it should be it's lost doesn't know where it is and then now all the Predators cos predators can come and rip that thing apart and it was the same thing for our our Lord Jesus he was despised he is rejected I think the scripture says we hid our faces from him right and and he was torn he was wounded he was mad more than any other man amen and he carried our sins far away just like the scapegoat carried the sins of the people away hallelujah so the scapegoat in the scripture is not the devil the scapegoat in scriptures is our Lord Jesus Christ because otherwise the devil would have a part of our atonement no he's just going to burn he's our enemy Amen so we won't even and and I said that because you'd say well won't we remember the devil cause he's our scapegoat no cuz he's not said to me he won't even be a memory but we shall still be hallelujah now I might just I might just think I've got too much here but to you know start a whole different thing but I just want to I want to just stay with leave with this thought and then maybe we'll pick this up another time but but when when Adam I mean sorry when when Elijah was sent to the widow woman to be fed remember she was she was a Gentile she was sent he was sent to her em and brother Brahim says now to be he says doesn't be certain of God he says now that this little woman must have been of this of the calibre of Elijah that's why Elijah was sent to her because usually your actions show what you are and again she had been chosen to entertain God's prophet remember she was a Gentile not a Jew and the land was burning up and no doubt that this little woman being of that caliber being of that believer type for we see that God would not have called to her if she hadn't been a worthy one to entertain God's prophet for he would never have sent his prophet to a house that was unworthy it was not his choosing it was God's choosing it wasn't her bidding him it was God bidding him he had been placed by a Brooke the Ravens were feeding him but it was God's command for something to take place and God sure and God surely went to a believer of the same nature of Elijah so the Prophet saying that the the widow woman was the same caliber as the Prophet and that's why the Prophet was was was looked after in her house now you could say she was of a like heart to the Prophet that's why the two came together and it's the same thing now with you and I and in our Lord Jesus right why is this wise he came our way remember the message is not 1100 and tapes it's not a whole bunch of testimonies 1100 tapes and some doctrine that's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ revealed right as Jesus Christ made known it's it's a person right so now why why has this message came your way it's not because to make you feel little and useless and insignificant and you can never obtain or become know it came your way because God knew you are the same caliber as the Lord Jesus amen remember we need to look at ourselves as God looks at us remember we are not downtrodden just making it you know how we ever gonna get there know when God made us it's just like David Sammy was told go to Jesse's house I have a king among his sons he was already king when he was a shepherd boy he was king right he was anointed then he hid then he was on his way to the throne so I was then him came out because of the anointing because of the word that was spoken over right that's the same thing with that so he David was the caliber of a king he already was he had to walk into it sure and mature but he already was already in him and the same thing with you and I we think how can we ever you know you know we're such you know we you know we look at our humanity in our faults and our failures and we no question and we and we struggle in things but but we have to come to a conclusion now the reason this word came our way it's not for us to be poor downtrodden people thinking we'll never make it it's actually that God wants to show us no no no you are a people after my own heart you are the same caliber as me amen just like the widow woman was the same caliber as Elijah we are the same caliber as the word I think you know I hope this doesn't sound proud because it's not but you know we have to look because we always think Lord why did you call me why did you choose this guy when there was billions of other people who you should have and God said no no don't wrestle with it don't wrestle with it just have peace in your heart the reason this this Lord Jesus can't you just like how the woman the woman came into to to where Jesus was was with with with unwashed feet she was so stood up this is wrong head to dormer Service had to kiss her make him welcome had to anoint them if something moved in us moved moved in her heart this is how he should have been treated right because she their prostitute was the same caliber as the Messiah okay men think about it remember Simon the Pharisee wasn't the same caliber as the Lord he was of such a low caliber he tried to make him feel little by not make him welcome because he was intimidated by this man from Galilee but if he was the same caliber it's hey welcome Lord take the best seat let me let me wash your feet myself let me anoint you myself let me kiss your feet make you welcome myself what can I do for you I love you so much you're so worth I'm so thankful you had come to my house amen but she was the same caliber because what the service that should have been done to him she did hallelujah it's the same thing with us what's our hearts desire what's our hearts desire that's not you know our has his eyes Lord I want to see you live you're so worthy you're so wonderful not that I would try and earn anything but because you're so good to me you purchase my salvation your son loving you're so kind you're so gracious hallelujah that you would call us you would redeem us you would wash us in your own blood isn't that our heart and so and so we like that woman Lord when I want to break my other best the box at your feet I want to anoint you want to make you feel welcome what but why is it in our hearts you know we don't want to sin because we'll get caught we don't want to sin because we don't want to we don't want to hurt him hey we don't want to hurt the Lord Jesus that's why we want to that's why the believers something in their heart they even get a bit tense about am i pleasing him am i walking right am i doing your because they they don't want to hurt him in any way because of love not out of fear because of love and the reason we are that way is because we are the same caliber as him because we want him to have the highest place in our lives we want him to have the highest place in our hearts right not our own ego not our own pride not our own ambition not our own choices not not our own selves we don't want that to be ruling we want him to rule that's all we want and the reason we want that it's because he has made us the same caliber as him because remember God's wife is not a second-class citizen in his house she is not on the outside and some and some little stable somewhere when when he's in the palace and and when I choose I'll come see your woman and you better to know you better have all this and no no that's not how he is with us yeah I want you by my side as I see it I think couple of summers ago Moses was told by God there's a place by me come and stand upon the rock there's a place by me as my glory goes past it's the same thing wide lead on Calvary there's a place by him he said he sees in Isaiah heaven as my throne earth is my footstool but where is the place of my rest in other words did I made the galaxies I made the nebulas on a yo-yo I made all these things just with my word I made this entire everything that's creator I made it I made heaven it's my throne I made the earth that's my footstool but where's the place of my rest and they should be selling at us saying Lord can make you both the human soul is the place of God's rest should be in us Lord come come rest a while not just for a day stay forever Lord stay in my heart forever I don't want to push you out by anything of my humanity anything that would be a no Lord just may have you arrested here hallelujah and why does he come your way just like the widow woman and Elijah because she's the same caliber as him amen let's just I'm just gonna leave it there but otherwise we'll go and tie something else but give me a heart like dying Lord give me a heart like dying none of my ambition none of my choices remember a sheep gives up its rights doesn't take it back this is how we should be he trying to earn something no cuz I love him he laid his life down for me and it wasn't even just like yo no debt that's nice but it wasn't just like a lethal injection or saying no it was the most horrible death you can imagine and it was actually more the center on his shoulders that was the gruesome thing but he laid his life down for me shouldn't we should we allow our lives down for him he would say in John and and I won't try and find it but by things in John 14:15 you know and there somewhere he says I have sanctified myself for their sake so so say he said he you know he lived a certain life not for himself but for you and for I first disciples shouldn't we live a life for our family shouldn't we live a life for our siblings for four brothers and sisters for our even our work colleagues friends shall we live such a life that the that they'll want what we have you know even if they say oh those people are friendly people why are they friendly you know what's what's different about them you know shouldn't we live a salty life that people want what we have not just a wall you better turn or burn your ternal you're gonna burn or whatever you know there should be something in us that draws people to the Lord shouldn't we be in that way I mean let's um let's dance shall we and you want to come musicians actually and then we'll then we'll pray over why'd you say all that for God wants to use your testimony to anoint it that you can help other people just like the Psalms just like any of Paul's writings he experienced it then he wrote about it God inspired his experience I mean it was and it's a blessing to multitudes she said why did I go through that God wants to use it for someone else amen we won't have a heart like the Lord let's just let's just pray shall we if you ever need just want to raise your hands I want to raise my hands Lord their God we want to be like David Lord that when you try our hearts Lord I'm sorry I didn't get back to that Lord the opening scripture but he said when you try out try my heart may you find nothing there Lord and that nothing is a as a failure that's so something that's not of you Lord I pray when you look down at us Lord you see our humanity and Lord and I'm so thankful that that that never never came into the equation log when you saved us Lord he saved us by election Lord you chose us before the foundation of the world but did God I pray that all of us Lord all those who may be listening now Lord may we come to you and say Lord search our hearts Lord if there's anything that's not of Lord anything not of you take it from us Lord Lord take all all pride Lord even a pity party Lord spirit or a gossip spirit or lot of pride and arrogance or or or unforgiveness stubbornness whatever it may be Lord thanks Lord Lord things can be appear so subtle but low when you put your finger on it Lord that's when things happen so Lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands Lord in this Lord this could be the last Sunday we have they'll be fine but Lord make our hearts like now in Lord Jesus take take all all things are not of you Lord just may you come with your Holy Ghost and put such a sweetness in our lives Lord that we just love everybody the matter what they have done to us or do or the treatise law I would just love everybody maybe not hold nothing against no one Lord man we just lay our past at your feet as well but you allowed us to live through certain things Lord many times great through great pain and hardship and sorrow and regret but Lord you allowed it Lord I pray you just use those things inspire them anoint them Lord that they'd be hop to someone else father may we never come across arrogant or proud or above anyone Lord you became the last of the low Lord to lift us up into heavenly places so Lord may we may we have a real humility in our lives help us
