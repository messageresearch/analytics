[45:27] nor we can only appreciate that by you
[45:30] being more personal to us
[45:33] by us lord falling deeper in love with
[45:36] you
[45:37] becoming more conscious of your presence
[45:41] that special personal protection that
[45:44] you place around our lives lord god
[45:46] we need to be more aware of that father
[45:49] because lord god with that sensitivity
[45:52] that level of consciousness father
[45:55] lord the love that it creates in our
[45:58] hearts father takes care of all our

[46:14] us to know your presence is right next
[46:16] to us lord god
[46:18] father we ask for more events closer
[46:21] walk with you lord deeper consecration
[46:24] lord that you would be more than just a
[46:26] sunday service
[46:28] more than something we read of in the
[46:29] bible or hear your prophets speak about
[46:33] lord god that we would meet you like
[46:34] jacob met you
[46:36] like your prophet mitch my father well
[46:39] that's
[46:40] that's how we are all to meet you from

[46:44] maturest one here
[46:46] to the babe in christ lord we all need
[46:48] to meet you
[46:49] we ask lord god in this dark hour that
[46:52] we are living in
[46:54] in this closing hour of time where every
[46:56] trace of
[46:57] light is being stamped out the devil is
[47:00] trying his
[47:01] hardest to stamp out the light the lord
[47:04] god
[47:05] you could look on the earth like you did
[47:07] before the flood
[47:09] and as noah found grace in your sight
[47:12] lord these people at shekinah tabernacle
[47:15] would find
[47:16] grace in your sight the saints in
[47:18] taranaki would find grace
[47:20] in your sight in this dark hour lord
[47:23] jesus
[47:25] that lord god as you revealed your mind
[47:27] your will
[47:28] to noah lord you would come personally
[47:31] to us
[47:32] reveal your thoughts to us
[47:35] lord we would appreciate how much you
[47:37] love us father
[47:38] lord we know you love us but make it
[47:41] very
[47:42] real in our hearts that love that you
[47:44] have toward us
[47:45] and lord god ignite our love toward you
[47:48] that's what we need lord jesus it's a
[47:51] love relationship
[47:53] that's what revelation is closeness with
[47:56] you like your prophet said lord
[47:58] he says i may not know the book very
[48:00] well but i know the author
[48:03] very very well that's what we want lorne
[48:06] we're not

[48:56] i am most of you do
[48:58] so i don't need to introduce myself you

[49:02] is and why he's not up the front he said
[49:03] i'm part of the furniture
[49:05] he said just come up so i'm here
[49:09] and what brought me this way was the
[49:11] premiere that
[49:13] brother isaac and his crew had been
[49:15] preparing for some time
[49:17] it's very unusual to see the church at
[49:19] the movies
[49:21] there's some great talent and god bless
[49:24] you brother isaac for
[49:26] the work that you're pointing in and the
[49:27] burden that the lord has given you and
[49:30] if the lord wills it to make the big
[49:32] film one day then
[49:34] wouldn't it be wonderful that was the
[49:35] last great feature film that was ever
[49:37] made
[49:38] on the prophet of god the time will tell
[49:41] so may lord bless you in your efforts
[49:42] god bless you everybody and we see some
[49:44] from taranaki
[49:45] michael and and margaret's moved
[49:49] this way and of course murray and moved
[49:52] and i mean it's just shocking
[49:56] terrible
[49:58] but i i know many of you and your yeah
[50:01] it's a good yes a sign
[50:02] i would come to this church if this
[50:04] church was in wellington
[50:07] not that there's anything wrong with our
[50:08] church but this is a nice group of
[50:11] people
[50:12] and and the lord is blessed you are the
[50:13] good past and good ministry and
[50:15] musicians and just everybody here you're
[50:17] very nice group
[50:19] and i pray that the lord would bless us
[50:20] all this morning um
[50:22] thank you brother ben for asking me to
[50:24] preach i don't go anywhere to preach
[50:26] i don't announce my coming i just turn
[50:28] up but if the lord
[50:30] lays on his heart to ask me and if he
[50:32] asks me i don't
[50:33] advertise myself then yes i'll take the
[50:36] meeting
[50:37] so we want to go into the scripture this
[50:39] morning
[50:40] and read from revelation chapter 15
[50:44] verse 5 to verse 8 of revelation chapter
[50:52] 15.
[50:56] i bring you greetings from my parents
[50:58] back home
[51:00] they asked me to extend their greetings
[51:03] to you all i i mentioned the brother
[51:04] already this morning that i'm here so he
[51:06] hasn't asked me to relay greetings so
[51:08] i'm not going to pretend that he did
[51:10] [Laughter]
[51:13] anyways revelation 15
[51:17] verse 5 to verse 8.
[51:22] john recording this book we know this is
[51:25] the revelation of
[51:26] jesus christ not the revelation of saint
[51:28] john but the revelation of jesus christ
[51:31] and after that i john looked and behold
[51:35] the temple
[51:36] of the tabernacle of the testimony in
[51:38] heaven was open
[51:42] and the seven angels came out of the
[51:45] temple
[51:46] having the seven plagues clothed in pure
[51:49] and white linen
[51:51] and having their breasts garden with
[51:53] golden girdles
[51:55] and one of the four beasts gave unto the
[51:57] seven angels
[51:59] this is one of the cherubim now and this
[52:01] cherubim is the eagle
[52:03] gave unto the seven angels seven golden
[52:06] veils
[52:07] full of the wrath of god so that means
[52:10] we had a very specific time in history
[52:12] now
[52:13] where the wrath of god is to be poured
[52:15] out who liveth forever and ever he's an
[52:18] eternal god
[52:19] without beginning without ending he is
[52:20] melchizedek
[52:22] and when these vials were going to be
[52:24] poured out the bible says in verse 8
[52:26] this is our key scripture
[52:28] this morning and the temple was filled
[52:30] with smoke
[52:32] from the glory of god and from his power
[52:36] and no man watch this no man
[52:40] was able to enter into the temple
[52:42] there's there's no more ministry being
[52:44] able to be carried out
[52:47] until the seven plagues of the seven
[52:50] angels were fulfilled very serious
[52:54] scripture
[52:55] let's pray one more time lord god take
[52:57] the scripture father in this late hour
[53:01] of uncertainty of chaos and confusion in
[53:04] the world
[53:06] and lord bring stability to our thinking
[53:09] bring stability to our hearts
[53:11] and lord god we would see
[53:14] how you are relating to us in an hour
[53:17] such as this
[53:18] we need not be afraid nor concerned
[53:21] but we can sing lord as we sung thank
[53:24] god i am free
[53:26] because of your blood in this hour
[53:29] where mercy is phasing out and judgment
[53:32] is being ushered into its fullness lord
[53:36] make this clear to all of us i pray
[53:38] help me lord to be as clear and concise
[53:40] as i can be and lord god we would
[53:43] cross examine our hearts take inventory
[53:46] of our lives
[53:47] seek our salvation with fear and
[53:48] trembling because it's a late hour
[53:51] and lord god time is short and like
[53:53] those wise virgins father
[53:55] we want to be ready so the lord when we
[53:58] are caught away we are caught away as
[54:00] that ready bride
[54:02] having the spirit on the word that we
[54:05] have received in our day
[54:06] we ask these things in your name amen
[54:09] amen god bless
[54:10] you may and take your seats this morning
[54:13] and for a subject i want to i want to
[54:16] speak on something that
[54:18] really was impressed on my heart to look
[54:21] into
[54:22] around the time that covert uh
[54:25] settled in last year now
[54:29] this worldwide pandemic was was
[54:31] something where
[54:32] everybody had a scripture everybody had
[54:35] a quotation about it
[54:36] everybody had a theory behind it but i
[54:39] believe that when events of
[54:41] this magnitude are taking place that
[54:43] there is
[54:44] a scriptural answer the answer is in the
[54:47] scripture
[54:48] the answer is in the message of the hour
[54:50] and even though you may not
[54:52] have all things revealed to you that
[54:53] does not mean there is no answer
[54:55] but that god has a season and a time to
[54:58] reveal to you personally what he wants
[55:01] to make known
[55:02] in the time that he has chosen and i'm
[55:05] sure that all of
[55:06] us can vouch for the fact that that
[55:08] there are times where you pray to the
[55:10] lord about something that you are
[55:11] wondering about in the word
[55:13] and you pray and you and you get out
[55:15] your sledgehammer
[55:16] and you begin to smash away at the
[55:18] scriptures and the quotes to make them
[55:20] fit your
[55:20] theory of what you think this thing
[55:23] means in the word
[55:24] but the best thing to do with any
[55:26] scriptural question
[55:27] is to put your sledgehammer away and say
[55:30] lord
[55:31] show me in your time what this means in
[55:33] the word
[55:34] and forget about it just forget about it
[55:37] one day maybe months later years later
[55:40] the ministry will come perhaps and say
[55:42] one thing
[55:43] that strikes a chord and in simplicity
[55:46] the answer is given
[55:49] maybe one day you'll have interactions
[55:50] with somebody out there on the street
[55:52] a heathen who will say one thing do one
[55:55] thing
[55:55] that settles the answer that you're
[55:58] looking for
[55:59] and if you have that attitude then
[56:01] you'll be a teachable
[56:02] son and daughter of god you will not be
[56:04] slanted in your understanding
[56:06] you will not be trying to push an agenda
[56:08] you're not a prophet like our prophet
[56:10] was
[56:11] we're not seers we're all reading the
[56:14] same message reading the same bible
[56:16] but we need the same god to give us
[56:19] his interpretation of the word not ours
[56:22] and so
[56:23] with this event that was really ushered
[56:26] in last year and has continued right up
[56:28] to now
[56:30] a thought that really came to me was
[56:32] from revelation 15.
[56:34] and i want to speak this morning on when
[56:36] the sanctuary becomes smoky
[56:39] when the sanctuary becomes smoky and i
[56:41] know that you are a very well taught
[56:42] church and you have very good ministers
[56:45] in this church
[56:46] and i'm comfortable to preach this in
[56:48] your church because you're trained in
[56:50] the word
[56:50] and this is not something that i would
[56:52] preach to beginners
[56:54] but if we are seasoned in the word then
[56:56] i believe that you will have the
[56:57] understanding to follow
[56:59] what is happening in the scripture
[57:01] because this scripture is for right now
[57:04] and i would again say go back home
[57:07] afterwards
[57:08] read these scriptures pray about these
[57:11] things
[57:13] the ministers elaborate on these things
[57:15] because
[57:16] it's a late hour and
[57:19] you need to be conscious of the time
[57:21] that you're living in
[57:24] for many still in the ranks of the
[57:25] message these things are only concepts
[57:27] in their mind
[57:28] of what god is doing but the word needs
[57:31] to come deep down into the heart
[57:33] so by god's grace as we look at this
[57:35] thoughts i pray that
[57:36] the lord would bless you he would sober
[57:39] you
[57:40] and that you would be more zealous and
[57:43] fervent
[57:44] in this finishing hour that we are
[57:45] living in when the sanctuary
[57:47] becomes smoky praise the lord i want to
[57:49] open with a quotation of our prophet
[57:52] the first seal of 1963
[57:55] this is the only quotation i'm going to
[57:57] read i'm not a big quote reader i just
[57:59] read one quote to set the scene
[58:00] and then we'll hit our thought the
[58:02] prophet said
[58:04] in the first seal he said here is the
[58:05] plan of it here's the great plan of god
[58:08] the first thing happens is that there is
[58:11] an
[58:11] announcement in the heavens first what
[58:14] happened
[58:15] a seal is open first thing a seal opens
[58:19] what is that he said a mystery is
[58:21] unfolded because when the seal is broken
[58:23] the mystery that was contained
[58:26] hidden by the seal is now able to be
[58:28] made known
[58:30] a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery
[58:32] unfolds a
[58:33] trumpet sounds because the trumpet in
[58:37] the bible is a disturbance
[58:39] a political disturbance a natural
[58:41] disturbance but it disturbs it
[58:45] he says and it declares a war
[58:49] and then he says and a church age is
[58:51] open and so forth he says
[58:52] what is the war part what is the war
[58:54] part he says the angel of the church
[58:57] catches the mystery of god not fully yet
[59:00] revealed
[59:01] that's why you need a prophet right if
[59:03] there's no william branham
[59:04] there's no mystery revealed he catches
[59:08] the mystery of god
[59:08] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[59:11] he catches this mystery of god
[59:14] and then he goes forth to the people
[59:16] after the mystery has been given to
[59:18] him he goes forth to the people what
[59:21] does he do
[59:21] out there he begins to proclaim that
[59:24] message
[59:25] and what does it start a war a spiritual
[59:29] war
[59:29] in other words this message is going to
[59:31] cause people to react
[59:35] to either before it or against it but it
[59:37] will cause a reaction
[59:38] because that's what the trumpet does it
[59:41] declares a war
[59:42] don't be surprised don't don't question
[59:44] how the greatest message
[59:46] 2000 years could cause such a reaction
[59:49] because that's what war is
[59:50] a conflict of two sites and then god
[59:53] takes his messenger
[59:55] with the elect of that age and he lays
[59:58] them away
[59:58] asleep and then he drops a plague
[1:00:02] upon them who rejected it a temporary
[1:00:04] judgment
[1:00:06] listen to the last part again after he
[1:00:09] has declared his mystery the the church
[1:00:10] age messenger
[1:00:12] god then takes the messenger off the
[1:00:14] scene and the elect who was sealed under
[1:00:16] that message
[1:00:17] all go off the scene as they did for
[1:00:18] seven church ages
[1:00:20] then god at the end of each age drops a
[1:00:24] plague on the age
[1:00:26] on the people who rejecting the message
[1:00:30] of the prophets
[1:00:33] the plague only comes because the
[1:00:35] prophet
[1:00:37] his message is rejected
[1:00:41] remember when the people rejected samuel
[1:00:42] samuel got a complex
[1:00:44] because they would not listen to him and
[1:00:46] the lord says he says it's okay he says
[1:00:48] they have not rejected you samuel
[1:00:50] they rejected me so when when our
[1:00:53] prophet
[1:00:54] is being put in the crosshairs
[1:00:57] and gunned at by all kinds of people
[1:01:00] it's god that they are against
[1:01:03] and so god now in the last days
[1:01:06] is going to pour out not just a plague
[1:01:09] but seven plagues
[1:01:11] seven vials on the last age
[1:01:14] for rejecting not a portion of the word
[1:01:17] the fullness of the word
[1:01:18] you think for seven ages it was part
[1:01:20] word part word
[1:01:22] so a plague would fall a plague not all
[1:01:25] the plagues
[1:01:26] a plague would fall but when you have
[1:01:28] the fullness of the word
[1:01:29] you get seven plagues for rejecting it
[1:01:32] seven vales with the roth of god
[1:01:36] poured out on those who shun
[1:01:39] what you are here receiving this morning
[1:01:42] remember
[1:01:42] to sit in the church doesn't make you
[1:01:44] bright
[1:01:46] it makes you a church goa because
[1:01:49] in matthew 25 was a parable of virgins
[1:01:52] they were wise and foolish and the
[1:01:55] difference between wise and foolish
[1:01:57] was that the wise had the spirit
[1:02:00] with the word but the foolish had the
[1:02:03] word without the spirit
[1:02:06] that's the difference that's all it is
[1:02:08] one has the word with the spirit
[1:02:10] the other has the word without the
[1:02:12] spirit
[1:02:13] so they are equally versed in the word
[1:02:18] in this quote the prophet is saying that
[1:02:20] the order of events
[1:02:22] is that a church age begins
[1:02:25] the ephesian age opened a seal
[1:02:29] opened for that age a mystery that was
[1:02:32] contained under that seal
[1:02:34] was revealed by the messenger of the age
[1:02:40] and his message was a sounding of a
[1:02:41] trumpet
[1:02:43] revelation 10 verse 7 says when the
[1:02:44] seventh angel sounded
[1:02:47] trumpet-sounding
[1:02:50] then when he's sounding his message
[1:02:52] there is a war
[1:02:53] in the unseen realm
[1:02:57] unseen realm war spirits that start
[1:03:00] moving into flesh causing reaction
[1:03:03] to the message either moving of the holy
[1:03:05] spirit
[1:03:07] or fallen angels demon power
[1:03:10] getting into flesh
[1:03:14] and a war started and then at the end of
[1:03:16] the age god drops a plague
[1:03:18] on the age and for seven church ages
[1:03:22] around the conclusion of each age
[1:03:24] plagues
[1:03:25] major plagues move throughout the earth
[1:03:27] now we are not looking this morning of
[1:03:29] what happened
[1:03:30] over seven church ages we are in 2021
[1:03:33] amen where seven vials will be poured
[1:03:37] out
[1:03:38] after the bride is gone amen you're not
[1:03:42] here for that
[1:03:43] but where you're living today is in a
[1:03:45] time where mercy is being phased
[1:03:48] out that the wrath of god might come in
[1:03:51] its fullness
[1:03:52] but as mercy is coming to an end and the
[1:03:55] fullness of god's wrath
[1:03:57] is to be poured out you are seeing a
[1:04:00] blapping over a blending time
[1:04:03] where mercy and judgment are present
[1:04:05] together
[1:04:06] on the earth now watch
[1:04:12] when moses built the tabernacle when
[1:04:14] solomon built the temple all of that
[1:04:17] was a shadow of the temple in heaven
[1:04:21] because in revelation 20 john said
[1:04:24] he was seeing the temple in heaven
[1:04:28] he saw the ark of god in heaven
[1:04:31] he sees an angel offering incense from a
[1:04:34] censer
[1:04:35] in heaven these are all temple things if
[1:04:40] you don't understand the temple
[1:04:42] how the services were carried out you
[1:04:43] will never fully understand the book of
[1:04:45] revelation
[1:04:46] because that's the heavenly temple so
[1:04:48] when
[1:04:49] when moses built the tabernacle when
[1:04:52] solomon built the temple
[1:04:54] they were only building in material form
[1:04:59] what was first seen in heaven
[1:05:02] what was first seen in heaven
[1:05:05] when when enoch built the pyramid he's
[1:05:07] building it after the pattern
[1:05:09] of the stars that's in the second heaven
[1:05:12] but where god is is the third heaven
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:18] our prophets he was liking noctu
[1:05:21] he was building a people
[1:05:26] amen when moses built the tabernacle
[1:05:28] he's building it after the pattern god
[1:05:30] showed him in the mountain
[1:05:31] mount sinai our prophet in the last days
[1:05:34] did not build a pyramid of stone he
[1:05:37] built a pyramid in
[1:05:38] flesh but the pattern he's building it
[1:05:41] after
[1:05:42] for him to build a church a super church
[1:05:45] in the last days
[1:05:46] the only way he can do that is to be
[1:05:48] lifted up into heaven
[1:05:50] and see the reality right in order to
[1:05:53] know how to build it on the earth
[1:05:55] so in 1960 the prophet is taken beyond
[1:05:58] the curtain of time
[1:05:59] where he sees your eternal
[1:06:01] representation he sees your theophany
[1:06:04] body
[1:06:05] he sees the pattern and then when his
[1:06:08] when his spirit comes back into the
[1:06:10] flesh
[1:06:10] body he's preaching the word to form a
[1:06:13] church into the image
[1:06:15] of the word representation he saw of you
[1:06:17] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:06:19] so the last day moses is building in
[1:06:22] flesh
[1:06:23] like what moses built in material form
[1:06:25] as a tabernacle
[1:06:26] we understand praise the lord
[1:06:31] so these things were only a shadow of
[1:06:33] eternity a
[1:06:34] shadow of heaven praise the lord now how
[1:06:37] was john able to see all these things
[1:06:39] because his spirit was caught up amen
[1:06:43] and for you to understand the economy of
[1:06:45] god you need your spirit
[1:06:47] to be lifted up into a higher realm
[1:06:50] beyond
[1:06:51] this realm where all the influences are
[1:06:54] trying to keep you earth bound
[1:06:55] to take you beyond that that you would
[1:06:58] understand
[1:07:00] god's thinking then you'll know how to
[1:07:02] move
[1:07:03] then you'll be like a laser-guided
[1:07:05] missile because jesus didn't go about
[1:07:07] praying for everybody
[1:07:09] jesus didn't go about healing everybody
[1:07:11] he did only what the father showed him
[1:07:13] he went to the pool of bethesda many
[1:07:15] were sick and afflicted
[1:07:17] he goes to one that's the one the spirit
[1:07:19] unction him to speak to
[1:07:21] and when you are more in tune with god
[1:07:23] you are you are dealing with specific
[1:07:25] needs by the leadership of the holy
[1:07:27] ghost and everybody
[1:07:29] else will misunderstand you and be
[1:07:31] highly offended by it
[1:07:33] because you are conscious of the
[1:07:34] leadership of god
[1:07:36] doing only what he wants you to do
[1:07:38] saying what only he wants you to say
[1:07:40] amen you're not trying to please all the
[1:07:44] others that are around you
[1:07:45] amen you want to live pleasing only him
[1:07:48] the lord jesus christ god him
[1:07:50] god himself so in our scripture
[1:07:53] in revelation 15 verse 5 we saw that
[1:07:57] john says the temple of the tabernacle
[1:08:00] of the testimony in heaven was
[1:08:02] open how can the word be shut
[1:08:06] was open and john is the bride isn't he
[1:08:11] when john said it was open now if you're
[1:08:13] rising up in these last days saying the
[1:08:15] word is not open that's not a good
[1:08:16] pattern of john
[1:08:17] because john said i was caught up by the
[1:08:20] holy ghost
[1:08:22] the word was truly open and i tell you
[1:08:24] if the word's not open you've not been
[1:08:26] quickened by the holy ghost yet
[1:08:30] now watch when did the temple open well
[1:08:33] when it says it was open it's already
[1:08:36] past tense
[1:08:37] it was opened not it was open when i saw
[1:08:39] it it was
[1:08:40] at that time revelation 15 it was
[1:08:42] already open when did it open
[1:08:44] when you turned to revelation 11 under
[1:08:47] the seventh trumpet
[1:08:49] under the seventh trumpet the bible says
[1:08:51] there was a great voice saying the
[1:08:53] kingdoms of this world have become the
[1:08:54] kingdoms of our lord
[1:08:55] and of is christ and at the last verse
[1:08:58] of revelation 11 under the seventh
[1:09:00] trumpet
[1:09:01] the bible says the temple of the
[1:09:03] tabernacle of the testimony was
[1:09:05] opened under what the seventh trumpet
[1:09:08] what's the seventh trumpet
[1:09:10] brother branham said our seven seals is
[1:09:13] israel's seven trumpets so if the bible
[1:09:16] says
[1:09:17] in revelation 11 that for the jews under
[1:09:19] the seventh trumpet
[1:09:21] the word is opened then if that is a
[1:09:24] shadow of our seventh seal what is the
[1:09:26] seventh seal
[1:09:28] the word opening up heaven
[1:09:32] the word opening of heaven so when you
[1:09:35] read revelation 8 1 it says there was
[1:09:37] silence in heaven the space of half an
[1:09:39] hour
[1:09:39] when you read revelation 10 verse 1 an
[1:09:41] angel descended it doesn't say anything
[1:09:43] about anything being open does it
[1:09:46] and the next verse of revelation 10 or
[1:09:48] verse 3 has an open book
[1:09:50] in his hand but if you want more detail
[1:09:52] just read the seventh trumpet
[1:09:54] because the seventh trumpet is the same
[1:09:56] as our seventh seal and it says under
[1:09:58] the seventh trumpet
[1:09:59] revelation 11 the temple of the
[1:10:01] tabernacle of the testimony
[1:10:03] was opened praise the lord
[1:10:12] and the seventh trumpet is for the jews
[1:10:15] elected jews 144 000 are going to hear
[1:10:18] the opening of the word if they're going
[1:10:21] to hear it you've got to hear it first
[1:10:24] so the seventh seal is not open yet that
[1:10:26] can mean nothing to the jews
[1:10:28] until it's been opened to you
[1:10:31] i know on an age level the word is open
[1:10:34] because our prophet preached to an age
[1:10:36] but the same angel that came to the
[1:10:38] prophet is the same angel who must make
[1:10:40] personal visitation to you to open up
[1:10:43] the word so that you can say
[1:10:44] the word is open amen otherwise you're
[1:10:48] in church
[1:10:49] hearing me preach this morning and it
[1:10:51] sounds good
[1:10:52] and you can scribble notes but it's not
[1:10:53] actually open to you because you're
[1:10:55] still living in fear and bondage and
[1:10:57] privilege
[1:11:00] amen now when jesus died on calvary
[1:11:04] 2000 years ago his death
[1:11:07] rent the veil of the temple that's what
[1:11:10] the bible says
[1:11:11] and he said it is finished behold the
[1:11:14] veil of the temple was rent and twain
[1:11:17] from top
[1:11:18] to bottom god rent the veil
[1:11:23] and that veil what did it
[1:11:26] shield off the holy of holies right
[1:11:29] remember there were two veils
[1:11:32] but this fail was the veil between the
[1:11:34] holy place
[1:11:35] and the holy of holies and when jesus
[1:11:39] died
[1:11:39] that barrier between the holy place and
[1:11:42] the holy of holies was done away with
[1:11:45] meaning that you can now look into into
[1:11:48] the very throne room of god because the
[1:11:51] holy of holies
[1:11:52] and the temple as a physical structure
[1:11:55] was only a
[1:11:56] shadow of the presence of god almighty
[1:12:00] in heaven and only the high priest
[1:12:04] could look into the holy of holies but
[1:12:06] if there's no more veil
[1:12:09] more than one can look in now think
[1:12:12] about this
[1:12:13] when adam and eve before they fell they
[1:12:16] were in the garden of eden the garden of
[1:12:18] eden was a type of the holy of holies
[1:12:20] is that right because in the garden of
[1:12:22] eden was the tree of life
[1:12:24] the tree of life was the ark of the
[1:12:26] covenant and the tree of life was god
[1:12:29] god himself and theophany form in the
[1:12:31] garden having fellowship
[1:12:32] now when adam and eve fell the bible
[1:12:36] says in verse 24 of genesis 3 that
[1:12:39] god put cherubim
[1:12:42] at the gate to the garden of eden
[1:12:46] lion ox man and eagle preventing
[1:12:51] god's son and daughter from having
[1:12:53] access
[1:12:54] to god's presence right now
[1:12:58] lion ox man and eagle and they were the
[1:13:00] barrier
[1:13:01] between eden and the garden so when god
[1:13:04] said to moses
[1:13:05] moses build me a tabernacle he then
[1:13:08] describes how the tabernacle is to be
[1:13:10] made
[1:13:10] and he says and make a veil and stitch
[1:13:14] stitch into the veil cherubim
[1:13:17] right exodus 25 stitch into the veil
[1:13:20] cherubim lion ox man and eagle were
[1:13:24] stitched into the veil
[1:13:25] embroidered into the veil right so
[1:13:28] nobody else but the high priest on the
[1:13:30] day of atonement
[1:13:32] could pass through that barrier once a
[1:13:35] year
[1:13:35] to cleanse the sin of the of of israel
[1:13:38] only once a year but apart from that one
[1:13:40] time which was a day of atonement once a
[1:13:42] year
[1:13:43] he could never go beyond the barrier so
[1:13:45] the lion oxman and eagle prevented man
[1:13:48] from having access to the throne room of
[1:13:50] god but when jesus died what does the
[1:13:53] bible say
[1:13:54] the veil that had the lion ox man and
[1:13:57] eagle stitched into it
[1:13:59] was torn so those cherubim that were
[1:14:03] preventing
[1:14:04] access to god's presence will move the
[1:14:07] sign
[1:14:08] and jesus could pass through and those
[1:14:10] that he died for
[1:14:11] could pass through the veil how can the
[1:14:15] word be shut
[1:14:17] how can the word be shut how can the
[1:14:19] temple in heaven be closed
[1:14:20] to god's sons and daughters
[1:14:24] praise the lord and what
[1:14:27] jesus accomplished on calvary
[1:14:31] in the physical realm was only a
[1:14:32] reflection of what god was doing in
[1:14:34] eternity
[1:14:39] praise the lord
[1:14:44] you know we would not know these things
[1:14:45] if there was no profit
[1:14:48] we would be hearing a feel-good message
[1:14:50] this morning pay your tithe say nice
[1:14:52] things to one another
[1:14:53] shake hands keep your grudges to
[1:14:55] yourself that will not put you in a
[1:14:56] rapture
[1:14:58] a man will make you a good christian but
[1:15:00] you're not going in a rapture
[1:15:01] a man bad tempered peter is going in a
[1:15:03] rapture
[1:15:06] man short fused paul was going in a
[1:15:09] rapture
[1:15:10] because god is looking at the gene not
[1:15:13] not at your
[1:15:14] ability to conceal your flaws god is
[1:15:17] looking at
[1:15:18] the gene amen because until
[1:15:21] until you're changed and the atoms
[1:15:23] you're going to have problems
[1:15:25] some of you i'm going to have trouble
[1:15:26] with and likewise you toward me because
[1:15:29] we're flesh
[1:15:32] amen we understand that we can take
[1:15:36] courage can we
[1:15:37] so revelation 15 when you look at verse
[1:15:41] 5 and 6 john says in verse 5 and verse 6
[1:15:45] of revelation 15 says i looked
[1:15:47] and behold the temple of the tabernacle
[1:15:49] of the testimony in heaven was open but
[1:15:51] when was it opened
[1:15:53] two thousand years ago for seven church
[1:15:55] ages
[1:15:56] a messenger for each age would catch the
[1:15:58] mystery of god
[1:16:00] and declare the mystery so the word has
[1:16:02] been opened
[1:16:03] more and more and more over 2000 years
[1:16:06] till in the last days the word is
[1:16:08] completely open
[1:16:09] and you sing that song here the word is
[1:16:11] open sin is broken
[1:16:13] there's nothing holding me anymore
[1:16:16] because the word is open
[1:16:18] for the gentiles the jews were blinded
[1:16:21] so that god could get himself a gentile
[1:16:23] wife
[1:16:24] but when the last of you is sealed
[1:16:28] when the last of you is sealed there's
[1:16:30] no more need for the blood for gentiles
[1:16:32] anymore and then this mystery
[1:16:35] that we have had the opportunity to hear
[1:16:37] and receive now will go
[1:16:39] to the jews via two prophets
[1:16:42] amen by our two prophets our prophet had
[1:16:45] the ministry of moses elijah and jesus
[1:16:47] christ
[1:16:48] and one man but in revelation 11 you've
[1:16:51] got
[1:16:51] two prophets one with the ministry of
[1:16:54] moses one with the ministry of elijah
[1:16:56] both revealing jesus christ preaching to
[1:16:59] a nation
[1:17:00] and of the nation the elected ones 144
[1:17:03] 000 receive it and are sealed
[1:17:07] now think about this think about this
[1:17:11] those jews if you understand how god
[1:17:12] will deal with the jews you understand
[1:17:14] how god's dealing today that those jews
[1:17:17] are a nation and god says in the word
[1:17:20] revelation 7 144
[1:17:22] 000 will be sealed and there are 12 000
[1:17:25] from every tribe
[1:17:27] now since 1948 all these jews have been
[1:17:30] coming back to the land and none of them
[1:17:31] know what trade they're from
[1:17:35] none of them know there were two
[1:17:36] captivities israel went into captivity
[1:17:39] judah went into captivity
[1:17:41] and those from the israel captivity when
[1:17:43] the assyrians came in
[1:17:45] but they're known as the lost tribes yet
[1:17:46] all these jews are coming back
[1:17:48] and of those jews some of them are from
[1:17:51] the historic captivity of israel and
[1:17:53] they don't know what tribe they're from
[1:17:56] so god has two prophets in revelation 11
[1:17:59] who are preaching
[1:18:00] jesus but those two prophets have to
[1:18:03] have discernment
[1:18:05] to know what tribe everybody is from
[1:18:10] amen because in in daniel chapter 12
[1:18:13] when michael comes down who is jesus
[1:18:15] christ
[1:18:16] he is delivering the names written in
[1:18:17] the book but he has to know who you
[1:18:20] are to call your name amen
[1:18:23] and and for israel he has to know what
[1:18:24] tribe they're from
[1:18:26] so in our day we had a prophet
[1:18:30] and we saw that at the end of many
[1:18:31] meetings the people would stand on the
[1:18:34] platform next to the prophet
[1:18:35] and the angel of the lord through the
[1:18:36] prophet would say you are mrs so and so
[1:18:39] and you live at this address and this is
[1:18:41] your problem go in the name of jesus
[1:18:42] christ you're now healed
[1:18:44] praise the lord but you know what that
[1:18:46] was the discernment of the book of life
[1:18:49] flesh life natural life and people say
[1:18:53] and they say when brother branham was
[1:18:55] doing the discernment line that was when
[1:18:57] the lord was truly speaking through him
[1:18:58] that's when he was genuine
[1:19:00] but during the preaching it is a bit
[1:19:01] like that no
[1:19:04] the end of the meeting when the people
[1:19:06] came out that was the discernment of the
[1:19:08] book of life
[1:19:09] flesh life but during the preaching he
[1:19:13] is discerning
[1:19:14] the lamb section during the preaching
[1:19:18] he's saying
[1:19:19] you are bright you are eternal
[1:19:22] your dwelling place is heaven amen you
[1:19:25] are the queen
[1:19:26] and this is your destiny and you don't
[1:19:28] have to accept your sickness and
[1:19:29] affliction
[1:19:30] he's discerning the the lamb section
[1:19:33] that's the important part
[1:19:35] but nobody wants to know about the
[1:19:36] important part they just focusing on
[1:19:39] well your name is mrs smith and you live
[1:19:41] at such and such a street in new york
[1:19:42] and this that but that's the natural
[1:19:43] section
[1:19:44] showing what he was doing during all the
[1:19:46] preaching
[1:19:47] and brother banham said the same holy
[1:19:49] spirit that is speaking now through the
[1:19:51] discernment
[1:19:52] is the same holy spirit's been preaching
[1:19:54] the last hour with all his stuttering
[1:19:57] and all the times he got his phrasing
[1:19:59] back to front the same holy spirit
[1:20:01] was speaking
[1:20:08] so these two prophets will reveal jesus
[1:20:11] to the jews
[1:20:12] and of them 144 000 will be sealed
[1:20:16] and in this day we have thousands in the
[1:20:18] ranks of the message
[1:20:19] a message has gone forth and of the
[1:20:22] masses a specific number
[1:20:24] are being sealed praise the lord
[1:20:28] and you want to know that you are one of
[1:20:30] them being sealed we don't come to
[1:20:32] church
[1:20:33] to walk out feeling unsure and condemned
[1:20:37] hearing the minister called me a buzzard
[1:20:41] no we come here to walk out saying i am
[1:20:43] brain
[1:20:44] i am brian we don't preach uncertainty
[1:20:47] you are bright amen
[1:20:52] these seven angels we read of in
[1:20:53] revelation 15 they come
[1:20:55] out of the temple in heaven
[1:20:59] and they are bearing the vials of god's
[1:21:02] wrath so where is the judgment coming
[1:21:05] from
[1:21:07] from god himself do you think god has
[1:21:11] been blindsided
[1:21:13] by a pandemic it's caught god by
[1:21:17] surprise volcanoes are
[1:21:18] erupting with greater frequency than
[1:21:21] ever before there's been an
[1:21:22] acceleration of earthquakes in ever
[1:21:24] before that
[1:21:25] man is degenerating faster you think
[1:21:29] that's caught god by surprise this
[1:21:30] morning or is it
[1:21:32] that this has come from his throne room
[1:21:36] to to to do what to fulfill his word
[1:21:42] to fulfill his word they have been sent
[1:21:46] by god these angels
[1:21:48] these seven angels are seven church age
[1:21:50] messengers
[1:21:51] and one of those angels is your prophets
[1:21:55] your prophets whose books you often let
[1:21:58] collect dust and cobwebs on the shelf
[1:22:02] he's one of the angels
[1:22:06] they are going forth with a message of
[1:22:08] mercy and judgment
[1:22:10] dependent on your attitude to the word
[1:22:13] all dependent on your attitude to the
[1:22:15] word
[1:22:17] and let me tell you young people
[1:22:19] regardless of where you are old even
[1:22:20] as well if you don't enjoy the things of
[1:22:24] god just tell the lord
[1:22:26] i tell the lord i told the lies lord
[1:22:28] reading the bible is boring
[1:22:30] i replace the bible i get confused lord
[1:22:33] but make it enjoyable
[1:22:34] i love you lord but sometimes very
[1:22:36] tedious to read your word i don't
[1:22:38] understand all the these and the vowels
[1:22:40] and the baguettes and and i and and the
[1:22:42] wording is so confusing
[1:22:43] but make it plain if you find listening
[1:22:47] to the prophet is boring if you find the
[1:22:49] ministry here is boring tell the lord he
[1:22:52] already knows
[1:22:55] he already knows god likes a good honest
[1:22:58] heart
[1:22:59] and i was telling ben last night what
[1:23:01] the lord liked about david
[1:23:02] he was a very good repenter very good
[1:23:05] repenter
[1:23:06] and when when when saul had disobeyed
[1:23:08] the lord
[1:23:09] god said to saul via samuel i have
[1:23:11] chosen me a man after
[1:23:13] mine own heart well god
[1:23:16] by his foreknowledge knew all the
[1:23:18] mistakes that david
[1:23:20] would make and before david had even
[1:23:22] made a mistake
[1:23:23] that's recorded in scripture god said
[1:23:25] he's a man after my heart
[1:23:27] it's it's it's stated before the fact
[1:23:29] not afterwards
[1:23:31] amen so before you came to flesh
[1:23:34] god knew all the mistakes that you would
[1:23:36] make but while you were an eternity sin
[1:23:38] you are a son after my own heart you are
[1:23:41] a daughter
[1:23:42] after my own heart why because when you
[1:23:46] make
[1:23:46] when you go wrong and the preaching of
[1:23:48] the word identifies the error
[1:23:50] you can say lord i'm sorry take that out
[1:23:53] of me i can't fix this i can't address
[1:23:55] this but you can
[1:23:56] and the lord likes that honesty and that
[1:23:58] honesty can only come from the gene of
[1:24:00] himself
[1:24:01] in your soul for you to say that amen
[1:24:05] because the prophet said the evidence of
[1:24:07] the holy ghost
[1:24:08] is that you can receive receive the word
[1:24:11] accept it lord i can't live it i can't
[1:24:14] line up with it
[1:24:14] i but i know it's the truth and lord i
[1:24:16] need you to make it real
[1:24:18] because i can't live it i burn out after
[1:24:20] 10 minutes
[1:24:21] but you make it live that's the attitude
[1:24:24] god likes
[1:24:25] in his sons and his daughters that's why
[1:24:27] he says and i love this son
[1:24:30] i love that door look at them make a
[1:24:31] mistake again man i love them
[1:24:33] just did the same thing that they were
[1:24:35] told not to do
[1:24:38] this wrath of god is coming from heaven
[1:24:40] and these angels we read of
[1:24:42] they are gert as jesus was girts in
[1:24:45] revelation 1
[1:24:46] dressed as jesus is dressed in
[1:24:49] revelation 1
[1:24:50] and the prophet said see he's the judge
[1:24:52] he's a supreme judge
[1:24:54] and when you see these seven angels
[1:24:55] coming forth they dressed
[1:24:57] just as jesus is dressed in revelation 1
[1:25:00] verse 13
[1:25:01] they are dressed to judge
[1:25:04] my
[1:25:08] dress to judge a message of mercy
[1:25:12] and judgment jesus is the
[1:25:15] high priest and supreme judge
[1:25:18] and each messenger was a priest of the
[1:25:22] age
[1:25:23] and he would bring down the wrath of god
[1:25:25] to the age all dependent
[1:25:27] on your response to the word
[1:25:31] for your day and these angels here
[1:25:36] are carrying a vile vile speaks of
[1:25:39] judgment in the bible
[1:25:40] you know when when saul was anointed as
[1:25:44] king
[1:25:45] he was anointed with a vile but when
[1:25:48] david was anointed as king he was
[1:25:49] anointed with a horn
[1:25:51] of oil showing god's perfect will for
[1:25:53] him to rule
[1:25:54] his people israel but upon saul came the
[1:25:57] judgment of god
[1:25:59] and yet saul was elect saul made it the
[1:26:02] prophet sin
[1:26:03] he just wasn't supposed to be king as in
[1:26:05] the permissive will of god to reign to
[1:26:08] hone david's character that's all to
[1:26:10] make him the fit king
[1:26:12] that's why he was there amen and and
[1:26:15] your boss
[1:26:16] is there not not
[1:26:19] maybe to be bribed but to hone your
[1:26:22] character to make you fit to rule
[1:26:26] amen now where we are living today we
[1:26:29] are coming to the end
[1:26:31] of mercy mercy is not over don't think
[1:26:34] that this morning
[1:26:35] don't think that mercy is finished mercy
[1:26:38] is still present because you're here
[1:26:40] where the word is in the bride is where
[1:26:42] mercy is which is the blood
[1:26:44] for the age so mercy is still here but
[1:26:46] where we are today in 2021
[1:26:48] is that the time is running out time is
[1:26:50] short and we will soon be
[1:26:53] taken away amen we are not waiting for
[1:26:56] the coming of the lord the lord has come
[1:26:59] in word form but what we are waiting for
[1:27:01] is the catching away
[1:27:02] of the coming brother eugene brown said
[1:27:06] he says the the rapture is just for you
[1:27:08] to change dimensions to go to the
[1:27:10] wedding supper
[1:27:11] just to it's just to transport you
[1:27:13] that's all it's for
[1:27:15] it's to transport her that's already
[1:27:17] married you're not
[1:27:18] going there to be married you're married
[1:27:21] here but you have to be transported via
[1:27:23] the body change
[1:27:25] to go to the marriage supper that's all
[1:27:28] it's for
[1:27:28] but if you're not married here as much
[1:27:31] as you're looking forward to raps you're
[1:27:33] not going in it
[1:27:34] the bridesmaids are not going in it
[1:27:37] foolish virgins are not going
[1:27:39] in it only she who is married
[1:27:42] now by the celebrant of the prophets
[1:27:46] is going praise the lord and we are
[1:27:49] looking forward to the
[1:27:50] catching away of his coming
[1:27:54] and that's where we are coming to right
[1:27:55] now and when you go
[1:27:58] the blood leaves the earth for the
[1:28:01] gentiles
[1:28:02] no more mercy no more mercy
[1:28:07] and when god is announcing changing of
[1:28:09] dispensation in the bible
[1:28:11] there's an earthquake when you look at
[1:28:13] the book of revelation there were voices
[1:28:15] and
[1:28:15] thunderings and lightnings and an
[1:28:17] earthquake
[1:28:18] when the law was given on mount sinai
[1:28:20] there was an earthquake
[1:28:22] in the days of noah the bible said the
[1:28:23] foundations of the earth were broken
[1:28:27] amen an earthquake when jesus died on
[1:28:30] calvary
[1:28:31] there was an earthquake and our prophet
[1:28:34] rebuked
[1:28:34] los angeles he says you're like
[1:28:37] capernaum
[1:28:39] and you'll go beneath the sea one mile
[1:28:40] plumbed down into the sea
[1:28:43] there'll be an earthquake to finish off
[1:28:45] the gentile dispensation
[1:28:48] amen and after the ministry of the two
[1:28:51] prophets to the jews in revelation 11
[1:28:53] there's one more earthquake revelation
[1:28:55] 16.
[1:28:56] another earthquake to finish off
[1:28:59] the ministry of two prophets to the
[1:29:01] jewish age
[1:29:05] so where we are right now is a time
[1:29:08] where a great earthquake is going to
[1:29:10] happen
[1:29:12] and when that happens millions of
[1:29:14] innocent people will lose their lives
[1:29:16] that's not that's not funny it's not
[1:29:19] something to glorify
[1:29:21] but that's the truth millions of
[1:29:23] innocent people will die
[1:29:26] and when that happens there's no more
[1:29:28] mercy
[1:29:30] and when that happens people get
[1:29:32] religious
[1:29:34] when two large towers fell everybody got
[1:29:37] very religious
[1:29:40] it doesn't matter how they fell but they
[1:29:43] fell they were there in the morning
[1:29:45] they were not there in the afternoon and
[1:29:48] everybody got very religious
[1:29:50] were burning candles going to cathedrals
[1:29:53] until everything settled down they were
[1:29:54] back into sin again
[1:29:56] right think about a pandemic and
[1:30:00] lockdowns everybody's
[1:30:01] bonding together being a real team
[1:30:03] spirit
[1:30:04] and when it's all normality is restored
[1:30:06] it's back into sinning again
[1:30:09] that's what it's like so so when
[1:30:12] this event happens it's going to be a
[1:30:14] great awakening for people there's a
[1:30:17] serious event
[1:30:18] but nobody knows the significance behind
[1:30:20] the event
[1:30:21] but the bride because she knows it's
[1:30:24] only a few days now
[1:30:26] and we're out of here but before that
[1:30:29] is a time to reach out
[1:30:32] as god has made you to intercede for
[1:30:35] those
[1:30:37] who are not in the position that you
[1:30:39] were in now is your time to do that
[1:30:42] because then it's too late and like noah
[1:30:45] you'll be standing on the bow of the
[1:30:47] boat
[1:30:47] preaching to the eternally lust because
[1:30:50] when noah went into the ark the bible
[1:30:51] says
[1:30:52] god shut the door noah didn't reach an
[1:30:54] alton
[1:30:55] and close it god shut the door and then
[1:30:58] for seven days
[1:30:59] there was a waiting time before the
[1:31:02] flood struck
[1:31:03] the wrath of god was poured out in its
[1:31:04] fullness and so in those seven days
[1:31:07] noah is standing on the ship preaching
[1:31:10] to the lost and they're still mocking
[1:31:11] him
[1:31:12] because there's no rain you think the
[1:31:14] earth
[1:31:15] that people are going to believe the
[1:31:16] world has been going to burn by fire the
[1:31:18] world is never burnt by fire
[1:31:19] in noah's day there was never a flood
[1:31:22] they couldn't understand
[1:31:24] how could how could the world be
[1:31:26] overflowed with the water it's never
[1:31:27] happened before
[1:31:28] it was a joke but it won't be a it
[1:31:30] wasn't a joke anymore right once the
[1:31:32] event had happened
[1:31:33] because they had seen it the world has
[1:31:35] never burnt by fire before
[1:31:37] it's never happened and you're standing
[1:31:39] there saying the lord is going to burn
[1:31:40] this earth with fire
[1:31:41] we're going to walk out on the ashes of
[1:31:43] the wicked and that is a joke
[1:31:45] but god is going to do it and it will
[1:31:47] not be a joke
[1:31:51] when that earthquake happens for that
[1:31:53] space of time that's the last part of
[1:31:55] that third paul ministry
[1:31:56] preaching to the eternally lost
[1:32:01] preaching to the lost the mercy seat
[1:32:05] which it is now becomes the judgment
[1:32:08] seat
[1:32:10] because you can come and kneel and cry
[1:32:13] at the altar
[1:32:14] pick up your bible pick up a message
[1:32:16] book it would be no good now is the time
[1:32:18] of salvation
[1:32:19] now is a time of salvation not tomorrow
[1:32:23] not after the meeting now is a time of
[1:32:26] salvation
[1:32:28] to walk with the lord you realize things
[1:32:31] have gone
[1:32:32] every man has to appear before god
[1:32:35] whether you are a believer or an
[1:32:37] unbeliever all stand before god and when
[1:32:40] you are raptured
[1:32:41] when the book of corinthians you stand
[1:32:43] before the judgment seat of christ
[1:32:46] not to be condemned because you are son
[1:32:48] of daughter of god but to be judged by
[1:32:50] the deeds done in the body
[1:32:52] for reward to be given
[1:32:55] amen and so that you can be shown before
[1:32:58] the bride of all ages
[1:33:00] and show unto your prophets
[1:33:03] show unto your prophets this is a man
[1:33:07] this is a daughter
[1:33:09] who heard your message think about what
[1:33:12] i'm saying right now
[1:33:14] you are going to be showed personally to
[1:33:16] jesus christ
[1:33:17] personally to the saints of all ages
[1:33:21] and to your prophet amen
[1:33:24] your life will be announced by god to
[1:33:26] all
[1:33:27] this is what my son did and and you will
[1:33:29] be rewarded based
[1:33:31] on how the holy spirit moved you in this
[1:33:35] life how you serve god in this life
[1:33:37] not not by works but by the moving of
[1:33:39] the holy ghost in your life
[1:33:41] this is not about this is not the great
[1:33:43] white throne judgment
[1:33:44] that's that's after the second
[1:33:46] resurrection that's
[1:33:47] that's for those whose names are on the
[1:33:49] book of life or not on it but for you
[1:33:51] you're in the lamb section
[1:33:52] and after your erection you stand before
[1:33:54] god to be announced before all
[1:33:57] and don't you want to be proud of how
[1:34:00] you've served them in this life
[1:34:03] not standing there man i wish i'd done
[1:34:06] more but you know the paradox of it
[1:34:07] saints
[1:34:08] is that wherever you are right now is
[1:34:10] exactly where god wants you
[1:34:12] exactly even if you're seriously messed
[1:34:15] up
[1:34:17] that's exactly where god wants you you
[1:34:19] can do nothing more
[1:34:21] and nothing less than where god wants
[1:34:24] you to be
[1:34:27] so even if you should say man i wish i'd
[1:34:28] done more but the prophet he was in his
[1:34:31] 50s he says if i'm going to do anything
[1:34:32] for the lord i need to do it now
[1:34:34] i mean the man that led millions to
[1:34:35] christ and we haven't led
[1:34:38] to people are they but yet what he had
[1:34:41] done
[1:34:42] was exactly what the lord wanted him to
[1:34:43] do and what the law wants you to do you
[1:34:45] will
[1:34:46] do but it might not feel very spiritual
[1:34:49] you might not feel very important or
[1:34:52] very anointed but it's what god raised
[1:34:54] you up for
[1:34:54] to do praise the lord amen
[1:34:57] and knowing these things serve god with
[1:34:59] all your heart you can stand boldly
[1:35:01] before him
[1:35:04] and be announced to all the saints of
[1:35:07] all the ages
[1:35:09] we are the bride saints and we are under
[1:35:11] the bleeding word of the age
[1:35:12] we are the blood of jesus christ to the
[1:35:14] age amen
[1:35:15] so when the veil was rent on calvary
[1:35:18] when jesus died
[1:35:19] paul says in hebrews chapter 10 it says
[1:35:21] brethren we have
[1:35:23] boldness boldness to
[1:35:26] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:35:29] jesus
[1:35:30] the blood of jesus is what
[1:35:34] the word for your day
[1:35:39] jesus says father sanctify them through
[1:35:42] thy truth what does the blood do
[1:35:44] it's the sanctifying source of the body
[1:35:46] it cleanses the body
[1:35:48] the spirit of the body is in the
[1:35:50] bloodstream
[1:35:51] and man that's why in the old days when
[1:35:52] they were bleeding people to cure
[1:35:53] disease they were killing them because
[1:35:54] the bloodstream was the carrier
[1:35:56] of the spirit of life and in the
[1:35:58] spiritual
[1:35:59] the blood is the word because it's the
[1:36:01] carrier of what
[1:36:02] the holy spirit
[1:36:05] and by the blood which is the spirit on
[1:36:08] the word
[1:36:09] you can go into the throne room
[1:36:12] of gods but if the word is not open
[1:36:16] then there's no blood which makes you
[1:36:19] unable to go into the throne room of god
[1:36:21] no unbeliever can access gods but you
[1:36:25] can
[1:36:26] because the blood was not shed for the
[1:36:27] world the blood was shed for the elect
[1:36:30] in the world
[1:36:33] and you can go boldly and not timidly
[1:36:35] not one of the lord will hear my prayer
[1:36:37] today
[1:36:37] go boldly in boldly got a problem go
[1:36:40] boldly before lord you ever need go
[1:36:43] boldly
[1:36:44] go confidently because you are his son
[1:36:47] you are his daughter he wants to hear
[1:36:49] you talking to him
[1:36:51] ideally more than you're talking to
[1:36:53] anybody else
[1:36:57] and we are not often bold to talk to the
[1:37:00] lord
[1:37:00] and present our needs we feel like we
[1:37:03] are
[1:37:04] we've asked the lord for 20 years how
[1:37:07] much more should we ask him keep asking
[1:37:11] like that woman lord avenge me of my
[1:37:13] adversary avenge me on my adversary just
[1:37:15] that that man that she had preached got
[1:37:17] so fed up he just did something about it
[1:37:20] go before the lord again and again and
[1:37:22] again until you get
[1:37:25] what you need amen so these seven angels
[1:37:28] with seven vials
[1:37:30] are our church-age messengers dressed
[1:37:33] like the lord is dressed they are
[1:37:36] dressed to judge
[1:37:38] but they are also clothed in linen
[1:37:42] because they are also part of the bride
[1:37:44] now you're the bride of jesus christ
[1:37:46] revelation 19 verse 8 says and to her
[1:37:48] the bride
[1:37:49] was granting that she should be arrayed
[1:37:52] in fine linen
[1:37:53] and white for the fine linen is the
[1:37:56] righteousness of saints not the
[1:37:57] righteousness of god
[1:37:59] the righteousness of saints the life
[1:38:01] that you lived for him
[1:38:02] here on the earth they are bright
[1:38:05] members like you
[1:38:07] are brother branham is not just our
[1:38:09] prophet he's our brother
[1:38:12] amen he's not just the the the leader of
[1:38:15] the age he is
[1:38:16] one of the bride he's one of you
[1:38:19] he's dressed as you addressed
[1:38:24] he just had a special ministry for you
[1:38:27] but he's one of you we know those that
[1:38:30] love him call him
[1:38:31] brother not jesus not worshiping jesus
[1:38:35] we call him brother
[1:38:38] amen now think when when this is
[1:38:42] happening in revelation 15
[1:38:44] the temple is filled with smoke what
[1:38:46] does that mean
[1:38:47] what does that mean when god
[1:38:50] instructed moses to build a tabernacle
[1:38:53] he built the tabernacle and there was
[1:38:55] the day
[1:38:56] of ceremony and the bible says then a
[1:39:00] cloud covered the tents
[1:39:01] of the congregation and the glory of the
[1:39:04] lord
[1:39:05] filled the tabernacle and moses was not
[1:39:08] able to enter into
[1:39:11] the tent of the congregation because the
[1:39:14] cloud abode thereon
[1:39:16] and the glory of the lawn fill the
[1:39:18] tabernacle
[1:39:20] you you can't stand in the presence of
[1:39:21] god
[1:39:23] rather than when he was caught up in the
[1:39:24] constellation of angels he was paralyzed
[1:39:26] for hours afterwards
[1:39:28] paralyzed couldn't feel his body
[1:39:33] when solomon built the temple on the day
[1:39:35] of inauguration
[1:39:37] to chronicle seven now when solomon had
[1:39:39] made an end of praying
[1:39:41] the fire came down from heaven and
[1:39:43] consumed the burnt offering
[1:39:45] and the sacrifices and the glory of the
[1:39:47] lord
[1:39:48] filled the house and the priests could
[1:39:51] not enter into the house of the lords
[1:39:54] because the glory of the lords hand
[1:39:56] filled the lord's house
[1:39:58] so that means now if the heavenly temple
[1:40:01] is filled with smoke no priest can go in
[1:40:04] no ministry of intercession can be
[1:40:06] carried out you understand the thought
[1:40:08] now
[1:40:09] this time that we are moving into now
[1:40:14] praise the lord and again in exodus 16
[1:40:16] in exodus 19
[1:40:17] where the glory of the lord came down on
[1:40:20] mount sinai and nobody could go
[1:40:22] up into the mountain to touch the
[1:40:24] mountain was death
[1:40:27] that's a very great god that we serve
[1:40:32] very great god that you serve very
[1:40:34] powerful god
[1:40:38] that we need to be more conscious of
[1:40:42] in isaiah 6 isaiah says this he says in
[1:40:46] the year that uzziah died
[1:40:48] i saw the lord sitting upon a throne
[1:40:50] high and lifted up
[1:40:51] his train filled the temple above him
[1:40:54] stood the seraphims and so on and so
[1:40:55] forth
[1:40:56] the whole and they were saying the whole
[1:40:57] earth is full of his glory and the posts
[1:40:59] of the door moved at the voice of him
[1:41:02] that cry what does that mean an
[1:41:04] earthquake
[1:41:05] the place shook and the house was filled
[1:41:09] with smoke from his glory
[1:41:13] from his voice
[1:41:16] the voice of the lord is going forth in
[1:41:18] these last days
[1:41:20] not just what our prophet said but when
[1:41:22] brother bends up
[1:41:24] preaching andy james
[1:41:28] all the ministers in this church when
[1:41:30] they speak
[1:41:31] it's god's speaking with all their
[1:41:34] humanity
[1:41:35] all their mistakes all the things that
[1:41:36] you know about them that's still god's
[1:41:38] speaking
[1:41:39] amen and to turn that down
[1:41:44] is to bring down the wrath of god
[1:41:49] you know you may not respect the man but
[1:41:51] respect his gift respect
[1:41:53] his ministry respect his message
[1:41:56] that's the important thing and the
[1:41:59] prophet
[1:42:00] says if you can't respect your pastor
[1:42:02] god can't bless you
[1:42:05] you can't respect just one another god
[1:42:06] can't god can't bless you
[1:42:10] this smoke that filled the temple is
[1:42:12] god's presence
[1:42:14] think of that how god's presence can
[1:42:16] manifest
[1:42:17] to judge
[1:42:20] or to bring favor to bring grace the
[1:42:23] presence of god can come down
[1:42:25] and it's not always a good thing
[1:42:28] depending on how you
[1:42:31] are relating to god when he comes down
[1:42:34] you see when the bottomless pit was open
[1:42:38] in revelation 9
[1:42:40] that's hell a dimensional world was
[1:42:42] opened
[1:42:44] when when the mighty angel came down
[1:42:47] with a book in his hand
[1:42:49] that opened up a world didn't it it
[1:42:51] opened up heaven
[1:42:52] because a book to open this book gives
[1:42:55] me
[1:42:56] access to information
[1:42:59] and the information it gives me access
[1:43:00] to is heaven which is the word
[1:43:03] in revelation 9 we've got another angel
[1:43:06] don't we
[1:43:07] he's not descending he's falling from
[1:43:09] heaven
[1:43:12] falling from heaven and in his hand is
[1:43:14] something
[1:43:15] a key what does the key do you put it in
[1:43:18] the door and you unlock the door
[1:43:20] to gain access to what is beyond the
[1:43:22] door
[1:43:24] so both angels have appeared on the
[1:43:26] earth at the same time
[1:43:27] in the last days both opening up a world
[1:43:31] one is opening up heaven by the opening
[1:43:33] of the book the other is opening up hell
[1:43:36] by the turning of the key
[1:43:37] and when hell is opened smoke came out
[1:43:41] of the pit
[1:43:42] and what was behind the smoke demons
[1:43:46] the smoke had the coming of the demons
[1:43:49] the people could not see the devils
[1:43:50] because of the smoke
[1:43:52] praise the lord
[1:43:56] so we see that the devil has smoke that
[1:43:59] he can fill the earth with a great smoke
[1:44:00] screen
[1:44:01] nobody can see the activity of devils on
[1:44:03] the earth today
[1:44:05] you know everything that you hear on the
[1:44:07] news that's broadcast in the media and
[1:44:09] the papers is a great
[1:44:10] smoke screen that's got everybody
[1:44:12] captivated but behind all that
[1:44:14] information
[1:44:15] is the moving of devils praise a lot
[1:44:21] and behind this message is the moving of
[1:44:23] another spirit
[1:44:25] and that's the holy spirit of god where
[1:44:27] is the holy ghost
[1:44:29] it's not out there it's in the message
[1:44:31] of the hour
[1:44:32] the holy ghost is on the word for your
[1:44:35] day
[1:44:36] amen amen the smoke came from the glory
[1:44:40] of god
[1:44:41] we see it can be a sign of god's favor
[1:44:43] or a sign of god's displeasure
[1:44:46] when korah nathan and abby ram and the
[1:44:50] 250
[1:44:51] princes challenged moses the prophets
[1:44:55] they came before the tabernacle
[1:44:59] and the glory of god came down in
[1:45:01] displeasure
[1:45:05] and they were there to challenge the
[1:45:06] prophet for the age and the glory of god
[1:45:09] came down
[1:45:10] not to show that he was well pleased
[1:45:11] with these people trying to find faults
[1:45:13] with
[1:45:14] moses birth and why moses said that
[1:45:15] people fell off the bridge and they
[1:45:17] can't find evidence for it
[1:45:19] the lord the lord came down in
[1:45:20] displeasure
[1:45:22] and the bible says there was an
[1:45:24] earthquake the earth opened her mouth
[1:45:27] and swallowed them up all those that
[1:45:31] murmured against moses and a plague went
[1:45:32] forth
[1:45:34] throughout the camp and aaron had to get
[1:45:36] a censor
[1:45:39] and stay the plague because the glory of
[1:45:42] god had come down
[1:45:43] not for a good reason but to execute
[1:45:47] those that would murmur against his
[1:45:49] vindicating prophet
[1:45:54] i tell you every time i hear the prophet
[1:45:56] speak i never hear a liar
[1:46:00] i do not hear a liar when the prophet
[1:46:02] speaks
[1:46:04] and the more that you spend in this
[1:46:05] message and you go on your journey in
[1:46:08] life the rich it becomes
[1:46:09] there is no way that we were deceived
[1:46:13] impossible is it totally impossible amen
[1:46:18] no priest could go in when the glory of
[1:46:20] god was present in the sanctuary
[1:46:22] showing that the smoky sanctuary in
[1:46:24] revelation 15 is ending the days of
[1:46:26] intercession
[1:46:28] after the bride is gone it's ending the
[1:46:31] day
[1:46:31] of intercession the day of mercy and you
[1:46:34] find in isaiah chapter six
[1:46:36] when the temple in heaven was filled
[1:46:38] with smoke
[1:46:39] isaiah was then sent forth to speak a
[1:46:43] message to those
[1:46:44] who had heirs and would not hear eyes
[1:46:47] that would not see and he prophesied
[1:46:49] for the devastation of the land because
[1:46:52] they rejecting
[1:46:54] his message amen amen
[1:46:58] this message that saves you noah's
[1:47:00] message that saved his family
[1:47:02] condemned the world condemn the world
[1:47:11] our profit was gun barreled straight you
[1:47:13] know he was gun barrels straight
[1:47:16] i've heard nobody else ever preached
[1:47:18] like he did
[1:47:19] gun barrel straight called
[1:47:25] and by his grace you have have had a
[1:47:27] chance to hear these things
[1:47:29] to be raised under these things
[1:47:32] amen so in revelation 19
[1:47:37] verses 11 to 15 when you go
[1:47:40] to the marriage supper via the rapture
[1:47:42] which is the
[1:47:43] mode of transportation when you are away
[1:47:46] and you're standing at the judgment seat
[1:47:47] of christ being announced before the
[1:47:49] lord being announced before the saints
[1:47:51] of all the ages
[1:47:52] being announced before your prophet then
[1:47:54] enjoying the great supper
[1:47:56] while that's happening two prophets are
[1:47:57] preaching to the jews on the earth
[1:47:59] the same message that you've had the
[1:48:02] chance to receive
[1:48:04] and once they have preached 144 000 are
[1:48:08] sealed
[1:48:09] by the holy ghosts then those prophets
[1:48:11] and those
[1:48:12] sealed jews are martyred and then
[1:48:16] jesus returns to the earth with his
[1:48:19] sealed bride which is you and i amen
[1:48:22] that's revelation 19 that's his
[1:48:24] third coming that's his physical coming
[1:48:28] there's three comings of the lord the
[1:48:30] first one was 2 000 years ago
[1:48:32] jesus born in flesh to die to pay the
[1:48:35] bright price
[1:48:37] amen you were chosen to be his bride
[1:48:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:48:40] and he paid the price on calvary second
[1:48:42] coming is
[1:48:43] perugia word his presence here
[1:48:46] today second coming that's the lord's
[1:48:50] third coming revelation 19 his glorified
[1:48:54] flesh
[1:48:54] with his glorified brides amen
[1:48:58] coming back to the earth for armageddon
[1:49:03] for armageddon and armageddon is the
[1:49:06] outpouring of the seven
[1:49:08] vials to purge the earth for the
[1:49:10] millennium
[1:49:12] because when moses and elijah in
[1:49:14] revelation 11 are preaching the bible
[1:49:16] says
[1:49:16] they smite the earth with plagues is
[1:49:18] that what the bible says
[1:49:19] they smite the earth with plagues so
[1:49:22] that's not the seven vials in the
[1:49:23] tribulation
[1:49:25] that's those prophets causing it not to
[1:49:28] rain
[1:49:28] that's the prophets causing the water to
[1:49:30] turn the blood
[1:49:32] that's the prophets doing that but when
[1:49:34] jesus returns
[1:49:36] with his in glorified form with
[1:49:38] glorified bride
[1:49:40] amongst the brightest seven men and
[1:49:44] glorified flesh
[1:49:45] who are the angels for their age bearing
[1:49:48] the viles
[1:49:49] to pour on the earth to purge it
[1:49:54] you understand now that means that when
[1:49:57] our prophet was here he must have been
[1:49:58] bringing plagues on the earth too
[1:50:00] if moses and elijah are plaguing the
[1:50:01] earth while they're preaching jesus
[1:50:05] against the enemy then our prophet as
[1:50:07] he's preaching the message of bringing
[1:50:08] plagues on the earth
[1:50:10] pick up a rock and throw it in the air
[1:50:13] thus saith the lord judgment will strike
[1:50:14] the worst case i believe england will be
[1:50:16] sunk someday
[1:50:17] los angeles is going to go beneath the
[1:50:19] scene
[1:50:21] he's calling down plagues while he's
[1:50:24] preaching salvation
[1:50:27] people want to feel good gospel they
[1:50:29] don't want to feel good
[1:50:31] but you need to be shaken up in this
[1:50:33] hour
[1:50:36] amen so here they come now
[1:50:39] to purge the earth and so in revelation
[1:50:42] 16
[1:50:42] these vials have been poured out and
[1:50:45] you're reading of what is in each veil
[1:50:47] but they've been poured out together a
[1:50:49] great cleansing of the earth
[1:50:52] and there's no intercession it's all
[1:50:55] judgment
[1:50:56] amen when esther came into her position
[1:50:59] as queen
[1:51:01] she pronounced judgment didn't she the
[1:51:03] king performed her word
[1:51:05] says the adversary is that wicked haman
[1:51:09] and the king the king that gave the
[1:51:11] order for the hanging but she spoke and
[1:51:13] the lord performed the king performed
[1:51:15] their words
[1:51:15] you speak you speak
[1:51:18] those seven angels are bright aren't
[1:51:20] they that bright they power the lord
[1:51:23] performs
[1:51:25] they pour the lord performs you realize
[1:51:29] saints
[1:51:29] if you're a son of god and somebody will
[1:51:31] not listen you can wipe the dust of your
[1:51:33] feet
[1:51:34] you you do the action and god will
[1:51:35] perform the cursing
[1:51:38] that's the power that you have as a son
[1:51:40] and daughter of god
[1:51:41] led by the holy ghost amen
[1:51:45] praise the lord
[1:51:49] let's turn in our bibles to ezekiel
[1:51:50] chapter nine i was saying brother ben
[1:51:52] last night i said
[1:51:53] ben on a wednesday night i'll try and
[1:51:56] preach for one hour
[1:51:58] because people work hard that time on a
[1:52:00] sunday you fall asleep that's your
[1:52:02] problem
[1:52:05] you stay up late on a saturday night
[1:52:07] that's your problem
[1:52:10] ezekiel 9 verse 1 and 10. the bible says
[1:52:18] he cried also in mine ears with a loud
[1:52:21] voice speaking to ezekiel saying
[1:52:23] cause them that have charge over the
[1:52:25] city of jerusalem to draw near
[1:52:27] this is ezekiel 9 verse 1 and 2 every
[1:52:30] man
[1:52:31] with his destroying weapon in his hand
[1:52:34] and behold six men came from the way of
[1:52:36] the higher gate
[1:52:37] which lieth toward the north every man
[1:52:39] slaughter weapon in his hand
[1:52:41] but among those six men was one other
[1:52:44] man the seventh man
[1:52:45] among them who was clothed with linen
[1:52:48] with a writer's ink on by his side
[1:52:51] and they went in these six angels with
[1:52:53] the slaughtering weapons they went and
[1:52:54] stood
[1:52:54] by the brazen altar of sacrifice they
[1:52:56] stood there
[1:52:58] whilst the seventh man clothed in linen
[1:53:00] with the writers in corn went forth
[1:53:02] to seal people first
[1:53:06] so in ezekiel 9 and ezekiel 10 you're
[1:53:09] seeing the same thing
[1:53:11] that we are reading of even in
[1:53:13] revelation 7
[1:53:14] and revelation 8. in revelation 7 verses
[1:53:18] 1 to 3
[1:53:19] you have an angel ascending from the
[1:53:21] east
[1:53:23] sealing 144 000 juice
[1:53:26] right and then in revelation 8 the next
[1:53:30] chapter
[1:53:31] you've got jesus himself pouring out the
[1:53:34] sensor
[1:53:35] of fire upon the earth to purge it
[1:53:39] but before the earth is purged in
[1:53:40] revelation 8 verses 3 to 5
[1:53:43] the jews were sealed and that is put
[1:53:45] there to show how god deals with the
[1:53:47] gentiles before god purges the earth
[1:53:50] he seals his bride first the jewish type
[1:53:53] is given
[1:53:54] to show how god is dealing with gentiles
[1:53:58] and now here in ezekiel 9 we are seeing
[1:54:01] the same scenery
[1:54:03] that intercession is coming to an end
[1:54:06] and the judgment the wrath of god is
[1:54:09] going to be
[1:54:11] poured out you follow
[1:54:15] good intercession is coming to an end
[1:54:18] and the wrath of god
[1:54:19] is going to be poured out
[1:54:23] now these six men they are angels
[1:54:27] and they have a slaughter weapon and you
[1:54:29] can't see them
[1:54:30] with this eye but when ezekiel was
[1:54:33] caught into heaven he could see them
[1:54:38] a hundred years ago as well isaac made a
[1:54:40] film from world war one there was a
[1:54:42] world war
[1:54:44] which suddenly stopped nobody can
[1:54:46] explain why the war stopped
[1:54:49] but john could because when john was in
[1:54:52] heaven
[1:54:53] he saw four angels
[1:54:56] standing on the four corners of the
[1:54:57] earth holding the four winds of the
[1:55:00] earth
[1:55:01] that they should not blow but nobody on
[1:55:04] the earth saw that
[1:55:06] they just saw bullets mustard gas
[1:55:10] death toll increasing armaments being
[1:55:13] produced that's all they saw
[1:55:15] but in heaven john saw four angels
[1:55:19] allowing wind to blow god said to these
[1:55:22] angels go
[1:55:23] forth and let the wind of war blow and
[1:55:26] they they are receiving more revelation
[1:55:28] in heaven because they are just
[1:55:29] going forth letting the wind of war blow
[1:55:32] and then finally
[1:55:33] an angel flies and says now hold the
[1:55:35] four winds
[1:55:36] now receiving more instruction in heaven
[1:55:38] and our angels
[1:55:40] stop the winds and on the earth the war
[1:55:42] stopped
[1:55:43] and nobody knows how
[1:55:46] you follow
[1:55:50] and the media can can write whatever
[1:55:52] they want but brother branham
[1:55:55] could tell us why
[1:55:59] and when that angel spoke to those four
[1:56:02] angels holding with the winds allowing
[1:56:04] them to blow he says
[1:56:05] hold the winds that they no longer hurt
[1:56:07] the earth
[1:56:08] do you know who that angel was that
[1:56:09] commanded the four other angels to
[1:56:11] hold the winds that was jesus
[1:56:15] that same angel that gave the
[1:56:18] instruction for the wind to stop
[1:56:20] blowing was the same angel who came to
[1:56:23] the prophet
[1:56:23] while world war one was still raging in
[1:56:26] 1916
[1:56:28] and he said to our prophet don't drink
[1:56:32] don't smoke don't hurt your earth
[1:56:36] don't defile your body in any way do not
[1:56:38] hurt this earth
[1:56:39] and that same angel who spoke to the
[1:56:41] prophet saying don't hurt this earth
[1:56:43] in 1916 while the war was raging then in
[1:56:46] 1918
[1:56:47] spoke to four angels and says stop the
[1:56:50] war
[1:56:51] no more hurting of the physical earth
[1:56:53] same angel
[1:56:55] but we read of history but unless you
[1:56:57] read
[1:56:58] what's happening in eternity you won't
[1:57:00] understand why
[1:57:02] see so in the unseen realm
[1:57:06] right now in this world today that's
[1:57:09] falling apart
[1:57:11] coming apart at the seams america is
[1:57:13] coming apart at the seams
[1:57:16] and new zealand will follow we are doing
[1:57:19] okay
[1:57:20] right now but we will surely fall apart
[1:57:25] because in the unseen realm are angels
[1:57:28] with slaughtering weapons standing by
[1:57:31] the brazen altar
[1:57:33] and the prophet said brass is judgment
[1:57:37] judgment for what sin the altar of
[1:57:39] sacrifice was made
[1:57:41] to address sin jesus died on the altar
[1:57:45] of the cross
[1:57:46] for sin
[1:57:50] and but the waiting for intercession to
[1:57:53] end
[1:57:53] waiting for the ceiling angel to go
[1:57:56] forth
[1:57:56] and seal all ordained to this message
[1:58:00] to receive it amen now you don't see the
[1:58:04] angels but what are you seeing
[1:58:06] you're seeing an arms race you're seeing
[1:58:10] great nations forming pacts getting
[1:58:13] jealous against america pushing america
[1:58:15] away
[1:58:16] starting to rally together building
[1:58:20] their armaments
[1:58:21] better armaments america's getting
[1:58:23] scared
[1:58:25] and these kings of the east
[1:58:28] the bible speaks of revelation 16 are
[1:58:30] doing this
[1:58:31] because they are anointed by six angels
[1:58:35] we're slaughtering weapons and the
[1:58:37] slaughtering weapons are what
[1:58:38] nuclear weapons aircraft with missiles
[1:58:43] all the latest technology to desecrate
[1:58:46] the earth
[1:58:47] that's the slaughtering weapons that you
[1:58:50] see in the physical
[1:58:51] but in the invisible it's angels
[1:58:54] standing next to the brazen altar with a
[1:58:56] slaughtering weapon
[1:58:57] waiting for the man in linen but you
[1:58:59] don't see a man in linen
[1:59:01] you see brother ben
[1:59:05] right you see brother ben preaching the
[1:59:06] word you see andy preaching the word
[1:59:10] you hear the prophet preaching the words
[1:59:13] you see the children see their parents
[1:59:15] trying to raise their children in the
[1:59:16] admonition of the lord
[1:59:18] that's what they see but in the
[1:59:20] invisible
[1:59:21] it's an angel in linen with a righteous
[1:59:24] incorn
[1:59:25] going forth to seal
[1:59:28] before the wrath of god is unleashed
[1:59:32] how do we follow amen
[1:59:38] but they can do nothing those nations
[1:59:40] until the last one has come in
[1:59:42] that's the consolation you have nothing
[1:59:44] can happen
[1:59:45] doesn't matter how unstable the climate
[1:59:47] is nothing can happen until
[1:59:49] we are gone amen until you are
[1:59:52] gone this man who is clothed in linen
[1:59:56] is jesus the high priest was always
[1:59:59] dressed in linen on the day
[2:00:01] of atonement the most important
[2:00:05] day in the jewish year was a day of
[2:00:08] atonement where sin
[2:00:09] would be absolved sin would be done away
[2:00:14] because what would happen saints is that
[2:00:16] for the past year
[2:00:17] everybody had been very sinful but on
[2:00:20] the last day of the year
[2:00:21] all the sin of the past 360 days or 365
[2:00:26] days
[2:00:26] would be erased
[2:00:30] by that atonement thereafter if you send
[2:00:33] it's not covered because the atonement
[2:00:35] only covered from here
[2:00:37] in the past year but anything after that
[2:00:39] atonement is not covered
[2:00:41] until the next day of atonement you
[2:00:43] understand now it's only covering up to
[2:00:45] that time
[2:00:46] but you go out and sin straight after
[2:00:47] there's no blood for that
[2:00:50] that's that's serious now because
[2:00:51] revelation is the day of atonement
[2:00:55] what is the seventh seal jesus
[2:00:59] dressed as the high priest in revelation
[2:01:02] 8
[2:01:03] verse 1
[2:01:07] standing before the altar of incense to
[2:01:10] offer incense
[2:01:12] which are the prayers of the saints to
[2:01:14] cleanse the sanctuary
[2:01:16] of sin and once the sanctuary has been
[2:01:19] cleansed of sin
[2:01:20] he takes the censer of fire and he casts
[2:01:22] it on the earth
[2:01:23] to bring judgment on the earth to
[2:01:24] cleanse the earth
[2:01:26] that's this time that's the seventh seal
[2:01:28] you tell me the seventh seal is not open
[2:01:30] what is happening under the seventh seal
[2:01:33] is revelation eight
[2:01:34] three two five an angel
[2:01:39] standing before a golden altar offering
[2:01:42] up
[2:01:42] incense which are your prayers of
[2:01:45] intercession now there's no if there's
[2:01:49] no seven seal open there's no
[2:01:50] intercession
[2:01:53] your prayers are powerless
[2:01:56] praise the lord it's in the bible it's
[2:01:58] an open book
[2:02:01] amen and when those days come to an end
[2:02:05] he takes those fiery coals that formerly
[2:02:08] would stir up the incense as a sweet
[2:02:10] savour that would please the lord
[2:02:12] do you know why the bible says there was
[2:02:13] silence in heaven
[2:02:16] because the day of atonement was the
[2:02:17] most solemn day of the year
[2:02:20] and on the day of atonement all of
[2:02:21] israel would gather
[2:02:23] in front of the tabernacle because they
[2:02:26] knew that their high priest was going to
[2:02:28] represent them
[2:02:29] before jehovah and he was going to take
[2:02:32] the blood
[2:02:33] and if he was not accepted
[2:02:36] he would die he would die if he was not
[2:02:39] accepted
[2:02:40] and if he never came back out
[2:02:44] if he never returned then
[2:02:48] he was not accepted and they were not
[2:02:49] accepted so while he is in
[2:02:52] the sanctuary where you can't see him
[2:02:55] they are all
[2:02:56] outside praying and when they're praying
[2:02:59] they are praying
[2:03:00] quietly not a noise silence
[2:03:05] because every day in israel in jerusalem
[2:03:09] at the time of the offering of incense
[2:03:11] which was every morning
[2:03:12] and every evening they were all quietly
[2:03:15] praying and that's what's happening in
[2:03:17] revelation 8 verse 1 the silence
[2:03:20] is the offering of incense time where
[2:03:22] people are praying saying lord
[2:03:24] accept us because if he don't accept
[2:03:26] them
[2:03:27] they're dead as a nation they're cursed
[2:03:30] now finished
[2:03:33] but when he appears if he comes back
[2:03:37] into plain view
[2:03:38] that means he's been accepted the
[2:03:41] blood's been accepted
[2:03:43] and you've been accepted because he
[2:03:44] represented you so what was revelation
[2:03:46] 10
[2:03:48] that's the high priest coming out of the
[2:03:50] holy of holies the mighty angel came
[2:03:52] from heaven
[2:03:53] the holy of holies to the earth the
[2:03:56] outer court where the congregation
[2:03:59] is and when you see him that means
[2:04:02] you have been accepted
[2:04:05] and you can rejoice
[2:04:10] but if there's no seventh seal open then
[2:04:13] there's no jesus who's come
[2:04:15] to tell you you are accepted before the
[2:04:17] father
[2:04:19] amen that's all this is not very
[2:04:20] mysterious isn't it it's just what it is
[2:04:23] it's very self-explanatory in the bible
[2:04:26] saints
[2:04:27] praise the lord and jesus said he says i
[2:04:30] pray for them
[2:04:32] he says i don't pray for the world i
[2:04:34] pray for them which thou has given me
[2:04:35] for they are thine
[2:04:37] amen is that that's jesus a lasered
[2:04:39] guided missile
[2:04:41] i'm not praying for everybody i'm
[2:04:43] praying for those whom you've given me
[2:04:45] amen jesus prayed we have a ministry of
[2:04:49] intercession
[2:04:50] we are reflecting jesus on the earth you
[2:04:52] know that a priest
[2:04:53] he reflects he represents a people to
[2:04:56] god
[2:04:57] the prophet represents god to the people
[2:04:59] but you represent
[2:05:01] your family to god your unsaved loved
[2:05:04] ones
[2:05:05] to god the youth to god you represent
[2:05:08] them
[2:05:09] in your ministry as a priest you need to
[2:05:11] be taught
[2:05:13] how to operate how to live as a priest
[2:05:16] bible says you've been made kings and
[2:05:18] priests unto gods
[2:05:21] amen amen this is the day where the
[2:05:24] ceiling is
[2:05:25] coming to an end now in revelation 8
[2:05:28] verses 3 to 5 as i
[2:05:30] just mentioned the bible says after the
[2:05:32] silence in heaven there was another
[2:05:34] angel who was jesus himself he stood at
[2:05:36] the golden altar
[2:05:37] he held a golden censer there was given
[2:05:39] unto him
[2:05:40] much incense two thousand years of the
[2:05:44] prayers of the saints
[2:05:46] being offered up that he should offer it
[2:05:48] with the prayers of all the saints
[2:05:49] that's what it represents
[2:05:51] upon the golden altar which was before
[2:05:53] the throne and the smoke of the incense
[2:05:56] which came with the prayers of the
[2:05:57] saints ascended up before god
[2:06:00] out of the angel's hand and then once
[2:06:02] it's all gone up
[2:06:04] the angel takes the sensor fills it with
[2:06:06] fire and
[2:06:07] casts it into the earth once all the
[2:06:10] intercessory prayer
[2:06:12] has gone up and he takes that sensor
[2:06:15] fills it with fire no more incense with
[2:06:16] this one
[2:06:17] cast it in the earth go and pray all you
[2:06:19] want in the cathedral
[2:06:21] no more mercy amen this is the day
[2:06:24] you have a very important position
[2:06:27] amen amen because the seventh seal is
[2:06:29] jesus and the seventh seal is here it's
[2:06:32] open
[2:06:33] he is here amen there were lightnings
[2:06:36] voices thunderings
[2:06:37] a great earthquake a day of atonement
[2:06:42] where where he's seen as the high priest
[2:06:46] for you he's the high priest amen
[2:06:49] but if you are not identified with that
[2:06:50] blood he's not the high priest
[2:06:52] he is supreme judge what do you see when
[2:06:55] you look up in the sky
[2:06:56] and you see the cloud what do you see do
[2:06:58] you see the supreme judge
[2:07:00] or do you see the high priest
[2:07:03] see when i look up i see the i see the
[2:07:05] high priest
[2:07:07] but if you're not connected with them
[2:07:08] you only see the judge
[2:07:10] because the seven church ages he majored
[2:07:14] as high priest but his minor role was
[2:07:16] the judge
[2:07:17] but in the last days his major role as
[2:07:19] the judge
[2:07:20] and minor role as high priest
[2:07:25] this is the fullness of judgment
[2:07:28] striking the earth
[2:07:30] when intercession is finished and that's
[2:07:32] where we're at right now
[2:07:34] the phasing out of mercy for gentiles
[2:07:40] center will be filled to cleanse the
[2:07:42] earth
[2:07:44] in the book of genesis there was sodom
[2:07:47] and gomorrah
[2:07:48] and sodom and gomorrah has appeared in
[2:07:49] the last days as it was in the days of
[2:07:51] sodom
[2:07:52] as it was in the days of life but before
[2:07:56] the golden censer of fire was poured out
[2:07:59] as fire and brimstone in genesis 19
[2:08:04] there was genesis 18. lord if there be
[2:08:07] 50 in sodom
[2:08:10] but what if there be 40 lord if there be
[2:08:11] 40 i will spare well what if it'd be 30
[2:08:14] all the way down to lord if there be 10.
[2:08:16] the lord said if there's 10
[2:08:17] i'll spirit there was intercession from
[2:08:21] who
[2:08:21] abraham god's friend
[2:08:26] the royal seed
[2:08:29] before god judged
[2:08:32] you are of the seed you're not of the
[2:08:34] seed of abraham you're of the
[2:08:36] faith of abraham you're of the faith of
[2:08:39] brenham
[2:08:41] and before god judges
[2:08:45] you have a part to play before the
[2:08:47] sanctuary is so
[2:08:48] smoky that there's no more priestly
[2:08:50] ministry anymore
[2:08:52] you have a power to play you have a
[2:08:54] power to play
[2:08:55] right now you don't sit in the chair in
[2:08:57] the sea wondering what you're here for
[2:08:59] because you're not called to preach you
[2:09:02] all
[2:09:03] sister brother young old have a ministry
[2:09:08] to do for the lord all of you
[2:09:13] and all you need is the faith to action
[2:09:16] what god wants you to do
[2:09:20] takes faith doesn't it do you have faith
[2:09:22] you have to be loosed from fear
[2:09:24] the reason why there's so much fear in
[2:09:27] our lives
[2:09:28] is because you're looking at things and
[2:09:30] involved in things
[2:09:32] that only generate fear and not faith
[2:09:35] amen anything of the world does not
[2:09:37] generate faith
[2:09:39] it will only generate fear which makes
[2:09:41] you lock up to serve god
[2:09:43] now if you're in that condition it's
[2:09:45] because you're exposing yourself
[2:09:47] to the wrong thing if you want a
[2:09:50] quickening of faith
[2:09:51] get under the influence of the word
[2:09:54] which will undo
[2:09:56] the fear to serve the lord as you were
[2:09:59] designed to serve god it's not very
[2:10:01] complicated is it
[2:10:02] you see you can come up the front and be
[2:10:04] prayed over every single meeting
[2:10:06] and i could pour out bottle of the
[2:10:08] bottle of the the richest purest olive
[2:10:10] oil on you
[2:10:11] and you'll still go out in the same
[2:10:13] condition if you're
[2:10:14] playing around with the world
[2:10:18] you want to fix all magic cure and you
[2:10:21] don't want to do anything
[2:10:22] you're called to separate from unbelief
[2:10:26] god is not going to push you through a
[2:10:27] tube the prophet said
[2:10:29] you have a part to play and when you
[2:10:31] hear the word preached
[2:10:33] when you see that you're falling short
[2:10:35] then deal to those devils
[2:10:37] and say lord strengthen me to execute
[2:10:40] some devils
[2:10:41] and let the light keep shining to flush
[2:10:43] out devils
[2:10:45] so i can have the faith to live as you
[2:10:47] want me to live
[2:10:51] this isn't this isn't deep is it it's
[2:10:54] very simple
[2:10:56] fear is the greatest curse the greatest
[2:11:00] curse
[2:11:01] that you allow to increase in your life
[2:11:03] because you play around with the world
[2:11:05] in the ranks of the message
[2:11:07] and that's why you're in those
[2:11:08] conditions
[2:11:11] we can talk holy talk all we want in
[2:11:12] church and in fellowship
[2:11:14] put on a smiley face as we do for one
[2:11:16] another i do that
[2:11:18] but you realize you get home behind the
[2:11:20] scenes you've got to face reality
[2:11:22] and that's very different story that's
[2:11:24] when you've got to meet god
[2:11:27] and some days you don't feel energetic
[2:11:29] in the flesh serving god
[2:11:30] not based on your energy levels it's not
[2:11:33] based on how much sleep you had the
[2:11:34] night before
[2:11:35] it's the word man that regulates the
[2:11:38] flesh man
[2:11:38] not the other way around
[2:11:42] praise the lord and so under the fourth
[2:11:44] seal
[2:11:45] when that pale horse rider was going
[2:11:47] riding forth
[2:11:48] the bible says there was sword and
[2:11:50] famine and pestilence and the beasts of
[2:11:52] the earth and that's what you're seeing
[2:11:53] today
[2:11:53] pestilence on the earth and sword war
[2:11:56] and
[2:11:56] famine famine
[2:12:00] not just because the economies are
[2:12:01] crashing but because
[2:12:03] great swarms of locusts are eating up
[2:12:05] the crops in africa and
[2:12:07] all around the world and there's famine
[2:12:09] but why is there famine
[2:12:11] because it's in the words because the
[2:12:14] message was rejected
[2:12:16] but while there's all of that he said
[2:12:17] you won't beg brent
[2:12:19] he said while there's pestilence there's
[2:12:21] an atonement
[2:12:22] and in the atonement of salvation and
[2:12:24] healing
[2:12:25] he forgives all your iniquities that's
[2:12:27] dealing with the soul
[2:12:29] he heals all your diseases that's
[2:12:31] dealing with the flesh
[2:12:32] and the spirit around he's made
[2:12:34] provision for you
[2:12:35] in the hour of his wrath
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:40] your provision is not a face mask it's
[2:12:43] not sanitizer
[2:12:45] your provision is in his words amen
[2:12:49] praise the lord and so in ezekiel knows
[2:12:53] my last page everybody
[2:12:56] do not fear last page
[2:12:59] when this when this man went forth to
[2:13:02] seal it was jesus christ the holy ghost
[2:13:04] himself
[2:13:05] in verses 3 to 6 of ezekiel 9 the bible
[2:13:07] says the glory of the god of israel went
[2:13:09] went up from the cherub
[2:13:11] you know the glory of the lord would
[2:13:12] hover above the mercy seat when he was
[2:13:14] there that was a very good thing
[2:13:16] would he be tired to have the ark of god
[2:13:17] in the presence of god not above it
[2:13:20] what what value is it to come to church
[2:13:22] and have the word and no holy spirit
[2:13:24] there
[2:13:25] there's only judgment there isn't it but
[2:13:27] you want to have the ark of god with his
[2:13:30] presence
[2:13:31] hovering on it amen and you are the ark
[2:13:34] of god today
[2:13:36] because he's not in some box overlaid in
[2:13:39] gold
[2:13:40] he's in flesh this humanity overlay with
[2:13:43] his deity
[2:13:45] and his presence should be upon that but
[2:13:48] here
[2:13:49] the glory of the lord went up from off
[2:13:50] the mercy seat
[2:13:52] and he called to the man clothed with
[2:13:54] linen which had the righteous ink on by
[2:13:56] his side
[2:13:56] and the lord said unto him go through
[2:13:58] the midst of jerusalem
[2:14:00] because in jerusalem that was the
[2:14:01] religious center of the day
[2:14:03] that's where the word went forth
[2:14:07] through the midst of the city and set a
[2:14:08] mark upon the foreheads of the man
[2:14:11] who sigh and who cry for all the
[2:14:13] abominations
[2:14:14] that be done in the midst thereof are
[2:14:17] you signing and crying
[2:14:19] when you look at the world today does it
[2:14:21] vex your spirit does it grieve you
[2:14:23] or do you quite enjoy what satan has
[2:14:26] made accessible to you
[2:14:29] how it allows you to just enjoy taking
[2:14:31] your mind off where you ought to be
[2:14:33] so you can play around with what the
[2:14:35] devil has to offer
[2:14:37] well have your eyes been open to see
[2:14:41] the reality of this word the lateness of
[2:14:43] this hour
[2:14:44] the urgency of it and the value of it
[2:14:49] to go before the lord say lord man not
[2:14:51] just me but them
[2:14:54] he says go and set a mark
[2:14:58] upon them that signed cry for the
[2:15:00] abominations and then he says to the
[2:15:02] other angels
[2:15:03] with the slaughtering weapons he says
[2:15:05] now
[2:15:07] go ye after him in other words follow
[2:15:10] behind him
[2:15:12] he's walking ceiling and behind them are
[2:15:15] these angels with slaughtering weapons
[2:15:17] go behind them through the city and
[2:15:21] smite let not your eyes spare
[2:15:26] neither have ye pity slay utterly
[2:15:30] old and young both maids
[2:15:34] and little children innocent people
[2:15:37] haven't reached the age of
[2:15:38] accountability
[2:15:42] but come not near any man
[2:15:45] upon whom is the mark and begin
[2:15:48] at my sanctuary
[2:15:51] not at the white house not at the
[2:15:54] beehive
[2:15:57] not in the center of wellington begin
[2:15:59] that shekinah tabernacle
[2:16:01] and start dealing to those who reject
[2:16:03] the selling angel
[2:16:09] cannot name a man that has my mark
[2:16:11] praise the lord
[2:16:13] if you've got the mark of god the holy
[2:16:15] ghost which is his seal
[2:16:17] what do you have to fear amen what do
[2:16:20] you have to fear
[2:16:21] then they began at who they began with
[2:16:24] the ancient
[2:16:25] men the oldest ones who knew better
[2:16:28] the ones that lived through the 50s and
[2:16:30] the 60s and the 70s
[2:16:32] i could see the change in the world and
[2:16:34] knew that things weren't right and
[2:16:35] and could could it could recognize
[2:16:37] things that the younger ones can't they
[2:16:38] start with them
[2:16:41] which we're before the house judgment
[2:16:43] begins in the house of god
[2:16:45] amen the older you get the more
[2:16:46] accountable you are
[2:16:48] more accountable you are amen if you're
[2:16:51] young and you know the truth
[2:16:52] you're accountable before god so the
[2:16:56] glory of god the shekinah the presence
[2:16:58] of god the purifier
[2:17:00] that dwell above the mercy seat left the
[2:17:02] glory of god was departing
[2:17:04] ichabod was being written on the age
[2:17:07] remember in the time of samuel
[2:17:09] eli the priest had two sons hofny and
[2:17:11] phineas
[2:17:12] and they they went up to battle with the
[2:17:14] ark
[2:17:15] and the ark was taken and hoffty and
[2:17:17] phineas were killed
[2:17:19] and and the news came back and phineas's
[2:17:22] wife was pregnant and she was about to
[2:17:24] bring
[2:17:24] forth and as she brought forth and heard
[2:17:26] that her husband was
[2:17:28] dead the wall was lost the ark was gone
[2:17:30] she called her son ichabod
[2:17:32] the glory of the lord is departed
[2:17:35] and that's where this age is the glory
[2:17:36] of god has departed
[2:17:38] from this age
[2:17:42] it's been written all over the earth god
[2:17:44] was showing ezekiel
[2:17:45] what he was about to do he told his
[2:17:48] prophet ezekiel
[2:17:50] because ezekiel is watching all this
[2:17:52] he's writing it
[2:17:53] and he can declare that to the people
[2:17:57] god always deals with the prophet
[2:18:01] value this message
[2:18:04] what god is saying through him is the
[2:18:07] seal for the age
[2:18:09] amen that's the seal you need in that
[2:18:12] man was jesus christ
[2:18:15] the high priest was speaking through him
[2:18:17] and every message is that man in linen
[2:18:20] with a writer's income by his side
[2:18:23] ceiling
[2:18:24] receptive hearts to their message
[2:18:27] praise the lord and then after he's
[2:18:29] sealed
[2:18:30] all these years you've heard preaching
[2:18:32] in this church i've heard preaching
[2:18:34] in our church zoom meetings all the
[2:18:36] preachings happening
[2:18:37] it's a time of sealing but one day it
[2:18:39] comes to an end
[2:18:42] and the slaughtering angels go forth and
[2:18:45] the first time they went forth
[2:18:48] one day the babylonian army because the
[2:18:50] bible says the angels came from the
[2:18:51] north babylon was to the north the
[2:18:53] babylonians came
[2:18:55] they traveled south and they surrounded
[2:18:56] jerusalem
[2:18:58] and they lay a siege to jerusalem nobody
[2:19:01] could go out nobody could come in
[2:19:02] caused everything to start collapsing
[2:19:04] and and all those jews
[2:19:07] that were not here ezekiel all they saw
[2:19:09] was the babylonians
[2:19:12] but ezekiel and those that had heard his
[2:19:14] message
[2:19:16] like jeremiah they saw six angels
[2:19:21] coming to judge those that rejected the
[2:19:24] ceiling angel
[2:19:25] see and those slaughtering angels killed
[2:19:29] those babylonians killed and took into
[2:19:31] captivity those people
[2:19:33] who rejected their prophets
[2:19:37] after the prophet's gone after he's
[2:19:38] given his message
[2:19:41] lest i the lord come and smite the earth
[2:19:43] with a curse
[2:19:46] and then in the middle of the bible here
[2:19:48] was jesus
[2:19:51] jesus was the word made flesh he lived
[2:19:54] out the word
[2:19:56] on the day of pentecost his spirit came
[2:19:59] onto the church and
[2:20:00] sealed them sealed them the ceiling
[2:20:04] angel
[2:20:04] sealed them then in ad-70
[2:20:08] the roman legions came they surrounded
[2:20:12] jerusalem
[2:20:13] all the elected jews they had fled the
[2:20:14] city because jesus said
[2:20:16] when you see jerusalem compass with
[2:20:17] arby's what happened was the romans came
[2:20:20] the zealots bit the romans back when
[2:20:23] they were beaten back
[2:20:24] the elected jews got out of the city the
[2:20:25] romans came back and surrounded it
[2:20:29] and all those in the city all they saw
[2:20:31] was roman legions
[2:20:32] but those who'd heard the message saw
[2:20:35] six slaughtering angels
[2:20:38] and they knew the day of pentecost was
[2:20:39] the ceiling angel
[2:20:42] because they were living in a higher
[2:20:43] realm and in this day
[2:20:46] we have received a prophet and his
[2:20:49] message was jesus christ
[2:20:51] who is the sailing angel and he is gone
[2:20:55] the man is gone but the spirit
[2:20:58] is still here and we have received it
[2:21:01] and are being sealed by it and when you
[2:21:04] go
[2:21:06] you watch all those superpowers
[2:21:10] cease preparing their weapons and put
[2:21:13] their weapons to use
[2:21:16] and the press can theorize all they want
[2:21:19] with
[2:21:20] who said what that upset whatever
[2:21:22] politician to make this happen
[2:21:23] what it is it's judgment angels
[2:21:27] after the holy ghost leaves the earth
[2:21:29] and the bride
[2:21:31] praise the lord so in ezekiel
[2:21:34] the musicians will come when ezekiel is
[2:21:38] seeing
[2:21:38] these things he's seeing
[2:21:42] a throne of mercy and judgment
[2:21:46] amen he's seeing a throne of mercy and
[2:21:48] judgment
[2:21:50] and so this morning or this afternoon
[2:21:53] the question is for you all where do you
[2:21:55] stand in relation to god
[2:21:57] how do you see the lord you serve him
[2:21:59] because you fear him
[2:22:02] or do you serve him because you love him
[2:22:06] we serve the lord because we love him i
[2:22:08] trust i serve the lord because i love
[2:22:09] him i have a lot of problems
[2:22:11] i don't deny my problems i go before the
[2:22:13] lord
[2:22:14] and i know that no matter how great or
[2:22:16] how small my issues are or yours
[2:22:20] god will deal with them all
[2:22:23] and we know that this is the time to
[2:22:26] go before the lord and to address these
[2:22:28] things
[2:22:30] because that time is short time is short
[2:22:35] the wrath of god will be poured out
[2:22:38] and so saints you have a ministry to
[2:22:40] your family of a ministry in the church
[2:22:42] of a ministry to your friends
[2:22:44] to your colleagues a ministry but if you
[2:22:47] are finding that you are paralyzed
[2:22:50] paralysis brother banham says when he
[2:22:52] got in the presence of god he was
[2:22:54] paralyzed
[2:22:56] and i tell you you get around the devil
[2:22:58] and you start playing with the devil you
[2:23:00] will be paralyzed
[2:23:01] will paralyze your faith brother bannon
[2:23:03] said about moses he says his
[2:23:05] faith paralyzed the world moses faith
[2:23:08] paralyzed egypt it brought that economy
[2:23:11] to a standstill
[2:23:12] and one night the firstborn died that
[2:23:15] was the future of
[2:23:16] egypt gone in one night because
[2:23:18] everything was laid up in the first born
[2:23:21] and when he died egypt's future was
[2:23:23] toast
[2:23:24] finished he paralyzed the world with his
[2:23:28] faith
[2:23:28] but let me tell you if you're not in the
[2:23:30] things of god
[2:23:32] you're not in his presence but you're
[2:23:33] playing around with anything else but
[2:23:35] the things of god
[2:23:36] your faith will be paralyzed
[2:23:39] spiritual paralysis and i tell you what
[2:23:42] i would say over 90 of people in the
[2:23:44] message are spiritually
[2:23:46] paralyzed why because it's not a
[2:23:49] revelation to them
[2:23:50] they have the word but no spirit to
[2:23:52] anoint the word let me tell you if you
[2:23:54] don't have the spirit
[2:23:55] go before god and say lord let your
[2:23:57] spirit
[2:23:58] quicken the word to me make it alive
[2:24:02] because when it's alive then you can
[2:24:04] walk and live and serve and have joy
[2:24:06] knowing the lord jesus in this finishing
[2:24:09] hour whether it be
[2:24:10] one month that we have two months a year
[2:24:13] whatever
[2:24:14] we have left go and serve him in that
[2:24:15] time within the time
[2:24:17] the prophet said about john the baptist
[2:24:18] god raised him 30 years
[2:24:21] for six months work you've done nothing
[2:24:24] for the lord god god might have been
[2:24:26] raising you all this time for a short
[2:24:28] work
[2:24:29] but all things that you go through is to
[2:24:31] prepare you for your ministry
[2:24:33] that's the consolation action your time
[2:24:36] saints
[2:24:37] i believe that's what the emphasis
[2:24:39] behind all the zoom youth meetings are
[2:24:41] this is the time this is the hour wake
[2:24:43] up the bridegroom cometh and his hair
[2:24:46] go ye out to meet him trim your lamps
[2:24:49] examine your life
[2:24:51] be ready to go because those who were
[2:24:53] not ready when they came knocking
[2:24:55] he says i knew you not in other words i
[2:24:58] had no relationship with you
[2:25:00] so what is revelation saints it's not
[2:25:02] about understanding what i said
[2:25:04] it's about knowing the lord jesus
[2:25:07] personally that's what it is
[2:25:09] don't go home tonight this afternoon
[2:25:11] lord i want to understand what he said
[2:25:13] said lord i want to know you amen and he
[2:25:16] can give the understanding
[2:25:17] behind what is said in his time what's
[2:25:19] what's this song
[2:25:28] yeah let's sing that one okay
[2:25:32] i saw
