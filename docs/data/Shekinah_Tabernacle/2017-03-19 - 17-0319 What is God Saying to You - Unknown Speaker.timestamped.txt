[1:00:33] much my brother amen Psalm 62 and we'll
[1:00:37] start from verse
[1:00:42] one amen truly my soul waiteth upon God
[1:00:45] from him cometh my salvation he only is
[1:00:48] my rock and my salvation he is my
[1:00:51] defense I shall not be greatly moved how
[1:00:54] long will you imagine Mischief against
[1:00:56] the man he shall be slain all of you as
[1:00:58] a bowing uh wall be and as a tottering
[1:01:01] fence they only consult to cast him down
[1:01:04] from his Excellency they Delight in lies
[1:01:07] they bless with their mouth but they
[1:01:08] curse inwardly sah my soul W thou only
[1:01:12] upon God for my expectation is from him
[1:01:15] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:01:18] is my defense I shall not be moved in
[1:01:21] God is my salvation and my glory the
[1:01:23] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[1:01:25] God
[1:01:27] trust in him at all times you people
[1:01:29] pour out your heart before him God is a
[1:01:32] refuge for us Sila surely men of low
[1:01:35] degree are vanity and Men of high degree
[1:01:37] are van are a lie to be laid in the
[1:01:40] balance that are altogether lighter than
[1:01:42] vanity trust not in oppression and
[1:01:44] become not vain in robbery if riches
[1:01:46] increase set not your heart upon them
[1:01:49] God hath spoken once twice have I heard
[1:01:51] this that power belongeth unto God also
[1:01:54] unto thee Oh Lord belth Mercy for thou
[1:01:57] render to every man according to his
[1:01:59] work am mean we'll just read that far
[1:02:01] let's speak to the Lord one more
[1:02:04] time precious and loving Lord
[1:02:08] Jesus oh God we can gather here we can
[1:02:10] go through all the Motions we can play
[1:02:12] Church father but that would not mean
[1:02:14] anything father Lord Jesus until you
[1:02:17] come and make the Supernatural Part
[1:02:19] alive Lord father and I pray this
[1:02:21] morning Lord that you will just take me
[1:02:23] completely out of the way father I just
[1:02:25] I pray that you will bless all these
[1:02:27] precious brothers and sisters Lord with
[1:02:29] your presence Lord I pray that you will
[1:02:31] use this vessel father to your glory
[1:02:34] Lord we want you to be lifted up father
[1:02:36] no man father that no man will be seen
[1:02:39] but Jesus only Lord father we love you
[1:02:42] and appreciate you so much Lord I pray
[1:02:45] that you will just come on the scene now
[1:02:46] and make this precious word so real
[1:02:49] father you see the need in every heart
[1:02:51] father Lord and I pray that you will
[1:02:53] just supernaturally Lord speak to those
[1:02:55] need
[1:02:56] needs Lord Jesus I also want to come
[1:02:59] this morning Lord and take every Spirit
[1:03:01] under my control for your glory Lord in
[1:03:04] the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ amen hallelujah amen you may be
[1:03:09] seated brothers and
[1:03:14] sisters now the title this morning is
[1:03:16] what is God saying to you and really the
[1:03:19] focus this morning is on that to you
[1:03:22] part amen because God is saying a whole
[1:03:24] lot of things am I mean but God is
[1:03:26] saying different things to different
[1:03:28] groups of people and what God is saying
[1:03:31] to you is determined by where you are at
[1:03:33] in
[1:03:34] election but there's a further part and
[1:03:37] that is your specific purpose your
[1:03:41] specific predestinated attribute am mean
[1:03:44] has a specific purpose that God God
[1:03:46] doesn't do things just willy-nilly I
[1:03:48] mean God doesn't do things just because
[1:03:51] he's bored I mean God doesn't do things
[1:03:54] just because he thinks oh might be a
[1:03:56] good idea amen hallelujah everything God
[1:03:59] does is for a predestinated purpose and
[1:04:01] because God has a has an intention he's
[1:04:03] got a goal in mind he's got a vision in
[1:04:05] mind of what he wants to
[1:04:08] achieve amen now there are so many
[1:04:11] voices in the world today Everywhere You
[1:04:13] Go voices voices voices amen and those
[1:04:16] voices enter us visually through our
[1:04:19] through our hearing through every
[1:04:20] everywhere we go everywhere we you know
[1:04:22] every direction we look I mean voices
[1:04:25] voices voices I mean there are just so
[1:04:27] many things everywhere you go sometimes
[1:04:30] it's just completely information
[1:04:32] overload I mean really in reality
[1:04:34] there's more out there than we can cope
[1:04:36] with that we can deal with naturally
[1:04:38] speaking and that's Satan's attack amen
[1:04:41] but there is a still Small Voice
[1:04:47] also I mean you can't turn
[1:04:49] anywhere telephone
[1:04:52] calls I mean there's terminology that a
[1:04:54] few years ago would be completely
[1:04:56] foreign I always chuckle if I think if
[1:04:58] we wake someone up that died 50 years
[1:05:01] ago even and we wake them up and we tell
[1:05:03] them all this stuff that now is Common
[1:05:05] Language amen they would think what
[1:05:08] planet are you from what language are
[1:05:10] you talking about amen I mean they would
[1:05:12] have known about telephone calls but
[1:05:13] today we have tweets and Instagrams and
[1:05:17] news flashes and voicemails and text
[1:05:19] messages emails Snapchats amen but then
[1:05:24] we have also the song when you walk into
[1:05:26] the McDonald's am mean that stuff comes
[1:05:29] into our senses am mean and we need that
[1:05:31] inner voice am mean to be stronger than
[1:05:33] those things we walk into the shopping
[1:05:36] mall we see the more than lifesized
[1:05:39] naked lady with underwear on standing in
[1:05:41] the middle of the road and a son of God
[1:05:43] will have to look away I mean because of
[1:05:45] that Life of Christ inside us I mean
[1:05:48] you're driving your car down the road
[1:05:50] down the highway and there's a huge
[1:05:52] billboard I mean you can't miss it if
[1:05:54] you want to and I mean you drive behind
[1:05:56] the car in front of you there's a bumper
[1:05:58] sticker on the back I mean the car
[1:06:00] driving past you has a custom number
[1:06:02] plate I mean and you what does that say
[1:06:05] oh yeah I get it I mean that kind of
[1:06:08] constantly constantly constantly we are
[1:06:10] bombarded amen the f Facebook messages
[1:06:14] that pop up now on people's cell phones
[1:06:16] when they walk around amen if someone is
[1:06:19] unhappy with service you know it's it's
[1:06:21] so common now people walk into a
[1:06:22] restaurant and they get bad service
[1:06:24] within 5 minutes the whole world world
[1:06:25] knows about it because it's already on
[1:06:27] Facebook just constantly information
[1:06:29] overload there's so many voices out
[1:06:32] there amen the mria of signage and Shop
[1:06:34] Windows when we walk down the road the
[1:06:37] Fashion's worn by people around us it's
[1:06:40] speaking a voice amen those things are
[1:06:44] all speaking to us the pile of junk mail
[1:06:47] that we get when we open our mailbox
[1:06:49] amen more voices more inputs and the
[1:06:52] opinions expressed by people around you
[1:06:55] when you go to work when you go to
[1:06:57] school when you walk down the road when
[1:06:59] you turn on the talk back radio when you
[1:07:01] turn on anything I mean voices voices
[1:07:05] opinions and I want to speak a little
[1:07:06] bit on some of these voices this morning
[1:07:09] I
[1:07:10] Meenan and every one of those voices my
[1:07:13] brothers and sisters can be a positive
[1:07:16] voice for you or a negative
[1:07:19] voice and sometimes a negative voice can
[1:07:23] come wrapped in a very positive
[1:07:26] package and sometimes and here's the
[1:07:29] scary part and now I'm kind of running
[1:07:30] completely ahead of myself but the scary
[1:07:32] part is that a a negative voice can be
[1:07:35] wrapped in the package of a blessed
[1:07:37] brother and sister of someone that's
[1:07:40] really close to you of someone that you
[1:07:41] look up to someone that you respect
[1:07:43] someone that that you open your heart to
[1:07:45] so easily sometimes those those people
[1:07:48] can also speak negative voices to you
[1:07:51] friends colleagues family I mean the
[1:07:54] thing most teenagers struggle struggle
[1:07:56] struggle struggle with is to be accepted
[1:07:58] in a group amen popular opinion opinion
[1:08:02] PR peer pressures and things I mean I
[1:08:04] think it was brother mana and then that
[1:08:05] shared with me recently they they uh and
[1:08:07] I might get it completely wrong but I'll
[1:08:09] just kind of give the gist of it um how
[1:08:13] people do tests and things and they put
[1:08:15] put people in in um in a room and and
[1:08:18] they would um they would give them
[1:08:21] choices and they they would choose
[1:08:24] between two choices two choices two
[1:08:26] choices and then the person who made
[1:08:28] them choose will take those away and
[1:08:30] scramble them and actually mix them up
[1:08:32] and come back and ask them why did you
[1:08:34] choose this one when in fact they chose
[1:08:37] that
[1:08:38] one so they didn't choose this one in
[1:08:40] the first place but people are so
[1:08:42] prideful I mean that they go and find a
[1:08:45] whole lot of reasons why they chose this
[1:08:47] one and it's a bunch of garbage they
[1:08:49] actually chose the other one I mean
[1:08:51] people are just like that am mean people
[1:08:54] want to be accepted am mean when the
[1:08:56] next person says something you don't
[1:08:58] want to be contrary amen because of
[1:09:01] group pressures and things the voice of
[1:09:03] popular
[1:09:04] opinion I mean yesterday Brother Andy
[1:09:06] and I after we dropped brother nesto at
[1:09:09] the airport came through town and lo and
[1:09:12] behold there's the gay and lesbian uh
[1:09:15] March downtown what a bunch of f i mean
[1:09:19] what a bunch of f but you know what 50
[1:09:23] years ago probably when they would have
[1:09:24] walked down the road with the clothing
[1:09:26] on and the way that they did they would
[1:09:29] probably have been arrested the whole
[1:09:30] lot of them but now it's oh it's so
[1:09:33] wonderful they're expressing their
[1:09:35] opinion what a bunch of garbage I mean
[1:09:37] but popular opinion has changed brothers
[1:09:40] and sisters this is Satan's Eden I mean
[1:09:43] popular opinion is no longer the word of
[1:09:45] God po popular opinion is no longer
[1:09:47] guided I mean by moral principles or
[1:09:51] even to be blunt by logical thinking
[1:09:54] people have become absolutely crazy out
[1:09:57] there but you know why it happened
[1:10:01] because it didn't happen
[1:10:02] overnight Satan runs a marathon not a
[1:10:07] Sprint he'll just give a little bit of a
[1:10:09] time just slip it in just slip it in
[1:10:12] Sister Chantel um shared something that
[1:10:14] that happened at her work with a guy
[1:10:16] that's a a crossdresser am mean he
[1:10:18] didn't Rock up at work one day and you
[1:10:20] know had his fish nets and his lipstick
[1:10:23] and all his stuff on he just
[1:10:26] kind of wore a song for a little while
[1:10:29] and then when people stopped talking he
[1:10:31] introduced the next little thing and the
[1:10:33] next little thing and after a long time
[1:10:36] no one is saying anything negative it's
[1:10:39] just man he's so he's so he's got such
[1:10:41] courage to express how he feels I mean
[1:10:45] but if he walked in there on day one
[1:10:46] like that everyone would have like
[1:10:48] weirdo I mean but that's exactly what
[1:10:51] Satan does those voices just wear away
[1:10:53] on us
[1:10:55] amen the voice of the media there just
[1:10:58] so many voices so many things that work
[1:11:01] in on us from all sorts of different
[1:11:03] directions amen they are not
[1:11:06] impartial they are not inspired by God
[1:11:10] Amen they are inspired many times the
[1:11:13] voices that we hear around us that's so
[1:11:16] common to us amen are not inspired by
[1:11:18] God and some of it comes so innocently
[1:11:22] amen a little advertisement for
[1:11:24] something in your email in your inbox
[1:11:26] and then there's
[1:11:29] filth you know so many times I've said
[1:11:31] it in church so many times when I search
[1:11:33] for a few pictures for for the
[1:11:35] Powerpoints amen you type in seventh
[1:11:38] seal naked woman you type in you know
[1:11:41] God naked woman everything everything
[1:11:44] everything is infiltrated amen by
[1:11:49] Satan
[1:11:52] Hallelujah then there's the voice of
[1:11:54] message Believers around around us and
[1:11:55] like I said at the start some are
[1:11:57] positive amen but whether we like it or
[1:12:00] not some are not good for
[1:12:04] us some of those voices are balanced and
[1:12:07] god-given
[1:12:08] but some are not amen and and I just
[1:12:12] want to make sure that that I get this
[1:12:14] very clear from the start amen the
[1:12:17] person carrying the negative voice may
[1:12:19] be an elected seed it may be a son or
[1:12:22] daughter of God but it just may be
[1:12:24] someone that's struggling with
[1:12:25] insecurities it may be someone that is
[1:12:27] just not maturing their walk with God it
[1:12:30] may be someone that God is allowing that
[1:12:32] God is using actually to give you a test
[1:12:34] or a trial amen so the package is often
[1:12:37] a real son and daughter of God but
[1:12:39] unfortunately there's there's negative
[1:12:41] voices
[1:12:43] sometimes there's sometimes
[1:12:46] pressure there's sometimes support from
[1:12:48] our close friends for the wrong things
[1:12:51] when we actually take a little bit of a
[1:12:53] wrong road amen it's so much easier if
[1:12:57] your buddy says oh that's all right
[1:12:59] that's not so bad I mean it's the
[1:13:01] typical church youth where you know
[1:13:05] there's a standard in the
[1:13:07] church and then the one 15-year-old says
[1:13:11] hey I'm going to go to the
[1:13:13] bicco and then the friend who would
[1:13:16] never have considered that thinks well
[1:13:18] if he can go I can go along too amen and
[1:13:21] the next one is drawn in and the next
[1:13:22] one is drawn in and before you know
[1:13:24] everyone goes the standard is
[1:13:27] dropped
[1:13:30] amen then there's another voice that
[1:13:33] plays an amazingly huge role in these
[1:13:36] things now it's lovely I can preach
[1:13:38] these things easy because I although I
[1:13:40] know a lot of you at arms length I don't
[1:13:42] know what's happening day today so
[1:13:44] praise the Lord I know I can't be
[1:13:46] standing on any toes uh actively so
[1:13:49] we'll leave it with the Lord amen but
[1:13:52] one of the things that's often a
[1:13:54] challenge is our culture and our
[1:13:56] upbringing amen we look at everything
[1:13:59] around us through the lenses of our
[1:14:03] family way this is just how we do it
[1:14:06] this is how we think about things this
[1:14:07] is how our church does it this is how I
[1:14:10] think about it this is how you know my
[1:14:12] culture my this my that Amen brother
[1:14:14] Marcus Becker when we were in Indonesia
[1:14:16] last last
[1:14:18] November he said yes I hear there's many
[1:14:21] cultures and things but the holy spirit
[1:14:24] is only one culture
[1:14:26] amen that was a really good good
[1:14:28] principle am mean the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:31] sensitive to certain things and
[1:14:33] insensitive to other things the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost is happy with certain things and
[1:14:37] unhappy with other things and no matter
[1:14:39] which culture you come from the Holy
[1:14:41] Ghost is not going to change his likes
[1:14:42] and dislikes based on your culture amen
[1:14:46] amen many many times you hear this is
[1:14:49] how mom taught me this is just how I do
[1:14:51] stuff amen I mean many of us can say
[1:14:55] today and this is not criticizing
[1:14:56] parents but I can say and and I'm sure
[1:14:59] many of you can say that some of the
[1:15:01] things mom taught me is not right amen
[1:15:04] some of the things mom taught me was
[1:15:06] because of her own
[1:15:07] insecurities sometimes just her
[1:15:09] immaturity sometimes just completely a
[1:15:11] wrong understanding it doesn't make her
[1:15:13] a bad person I mean she did absolutely
[1:15:16] the best she can but sometimes it was
[1:15:19] just
[1:15:21] wrong so the whole perspective of I'm a
[1:15:24] key I'm a African I'm an African I'm a
[1:15:27] this I'm a that whatever I mean actually
[1:15:31] my brothers and sisters I really really
[1:15:34] personally I try never to associate
[1:15:36] myself with an Africans
[1:15:38] culture because I want to be a Heavenly
[1:15:41] culture amen I'm to be blunt I'm ashamed
[1:15:45] to be a
[1:15:46] Africana and I know this will probably
[1:15:48] scratch some some you know headstrong
[1:15:50] africanos and I hope there's not no one
[1:15:52] like that here but but I'm ashamed when
[1:15:55] I read the the in the message how
[1:15:57] brother Brandon went to South Africa and
[1:16:00] we have those that real staun
[1:16:02] africanness you know pushed him in a
[1:16:05] direction that the Holy Spirit inspired
[1:16:07] him not to go amen but praise God I'm
[1:16:11] not Africana anymore I mean just like
[1:16:13] brother brandham says I'm not the son of
[1:16:14] Charles and Ella brandham I mean I've
[1:16:17] had a rebirth now I disassociate myself
[1:16:20] from my culture i disassociate myself
[1:16:23] from those things now of course there's
[1:16:24] a natural side you think about things in
[1:16:27] a certain way and so forth but what I'm
[1:16:28] saying is my brothers and sisters if the
[1:16:30] Holy Ghost takes over in my life if the
[1:16:32] rebirth has happened in your life I mean
[1:16:34] those things should be stronger than
[1:16:36] your culture than your anything
[1:16:41] else so we speaking of filters really
[1:16:45] amen how we look at life is often
[1:16:48] filtered through my culture my way my
[1:16:52] understanding how I was brought up and
[1:16:53] all those things and your culture can be
[1:16:55] a voice that's actually sometimes
[1:16:58] unfortunately overriding the voice of
[1:17:00] the holy spirit in your life then
[1:17:03] there's the voice of your
[1:17:04] pastor now brother Brandon makes a
[1:17:07] statement that he says your pastor will
[1:17:09] see you through he make statements like
[1:17:11] you can't live higher than your pastor
[1:17:12] now my brothers and sisters if it's ever
[1:17:14] in a pastor's heart to to hold that
[1:17:17] above people he's got a problem amen if
[1:17:19] the pastor bashes people on the head you
[1:17:21] can never rise higher than me bang amen
[1:17:25] that should never be in a pastor's heart
[1:17:27] but I you know knowing brother Ben I
[1:17:28] know that's not in his heart his heart
[1:17:30] is to lift everyone up his heart is to
[1:17:33] communicate the love of God his heart is
[1:17:36] I mean to submit to to put himself down
[1:17:38] like Jesus said when he when he washed
[1:17:40] the disciples feet am mean I didn't come
[1:17:42] to be ministered to I came to minister
[1:17:44] minister is a servant amen and I believe
[1:17:47] the pastor has to have a servant
[1:17:49] attitude my brothers and sisters but the
[1:17:51] reality is the prophet said he's the
[1:17:54] headship he he's the leader and God
[1:17:56] needs to lift him up in order to lift
[1:17:58] the church
[1:17:59] up I mean that's why just taking brother
[1:18:02] bam as an example that's why God had to
[1:18:05] take brother brandham off the scene so
[1:18:07] that we could come up to the same place
[1:18:09] that he was I mean otherwise that's that
[1:18:12] principle would still have remained we
[1:18:13] would always have been lower than the
[1:18:15] prophet amen but now when God pul put
[1:18:18] the prophet pull the prophet out of the
[1:18:19] way God raises us up amen so that we can
[1:18:22] have that individual walk with God
[1:18:25] but the pastor is just a man the pastor
[1:18:29] is going to make
[1:18:31] mistakes and that's why we have to pray
[1:18:34] for our ministers for our pastors we
[1:18:37] constantly we have to pray that God give
[1:18:39] them more Revelation am mean if you
[1:18:41] frustrated that and and I know this is
[1:18:43] not the case with with brother Ben so I
[1:18:45] can say it easily but if you're
[1:18:47] frustrated and saying man I wish brother
[1:18:49] Ben can have the same Revelation I have
[1:18:52] then pray for him amen calling him over
[1:18:55] and telling him you need to see this bu
[1:18:57] that's not going to help him amen all
[1:18:59] you're going to do is you're going to
[1:19:00] put a pressure on him amen and you're
[1:19:03] actually going to draw down his faith or
[1:19:05] pull down his faith amen what you do is
[1:19:07] you enter in on your knees and you pray
[1:19:09] for him and you ask God
[1:19:13] Amen and I want to ask the question do
[1:19:15] you really respect the office it's not
[1:19:17] the man it's the office am mean like I
[1:19:19] said the man has many mistakes if we
[1:19:22] look back at the time of of David now
[1:19:24] God was never a Democratic leader I mean
[1:19:27] brother Bram says God's way is a Godly
[1:19:30] King where God is in control of the king
[1:19:34] in fact when God has the king's
[1:19:37] heart then the Holy Spirit leads the
[1:19:40] king and the King leads the people and
[1:19:44] really if the king is genuinely
[1:19:46] completely surrendered to God it's not
[1:19:48] the king leading it's God leading
[1:19:50] through that King
[1:19:56] so when God was able to rule through
[1:19:58] David God was ruling
[1:20:01] Israel and as long as David was led by
[1:20:04] God Israel was the safest possible place
[1:20:08] to
[1:20:09] be even though they make mistakes and
[1:20:11] all those kind of things I mean they
[1:20:12] would be the safest place to be and I
[1:20:16] trust it would be okay to take that down
[1:20:17] to the local church when the pastor is
[1:20:20] led by God not led by pressures of what
[1:20:23] people put on him not led by other
[1:20:25] ministers around the country phoning up
[1:20:27] and saying you should do this and you
[1:20:29] should do that not by pressures by
[1:20:31] trying to match up with others not by
[1:20:33] trying to impress others nothing just
[1:20:35] being led by God Amen you'll be the
[1:20:38] safest church that you can
[1:20:43] be but like I said J David was just a
[1:20:45] man he made
[1:20:47] mistakes and when he made those mistakes
[1:20:50] Israel suffered with
[1:20:53] him but but my brothers and sisters
[1:20:55] there was not a single time that you
[1:20:58] read in the scriptures that God ever
[1:21:00] ever thought or uttered the words that
[1:21:03] I'm going to push you off the throne
[1:21:05] amen because David is the same one that
[1:21:08] writes in the Psalms God you know I'm
[1:21:10] but a man amen he knows his Frailty amen
[1:21:14] but God never considers pushing him off
[1:21:16] because of a mistake amen God says
[1:21:19] you'll suffer for it but God retains him
[1:21:22] there because God knows I've got his
[1:21:25] heart I mean brother Braham speaks about
[1:21:26] how he was quick to repent I mean and
[1:21:28] that shows when you're a Son of God when
[1:21:30] you're quick to repent and openly repent
[1:21:32] transparently
[1:21:34] repent and that's different than it was
[1:21:36] for Saul because Saul was never God's
[1:21:39] choice Saul was never The Godly King
[1:21:42] Saul was God's answer to what the people
[1:21:45] wanted it was what the people desired
[1:21:48] and God gave them what they desired and
[1:21:51] God showed them that's not what I wanted
[1:21:53] for you
[1:21:56] and God easily just wiped him off amen
[1:22:00] wiped him off of the throne I mean
[1:22:01] brother bam shows that he's still still
[1:22:03] going to be there amen and we know those
[1:22:05] things but in terms of the throne God
[1:22:07] easily pushed him aside because he was
[1:22:09] not The Godly
[1:22:12] King but you know what also happens and
[1:22:14] I know these some of these things can be
[1:22:15] sensitive but like I said praise the
[1:22:17] Lord I don't know your details so that's
[1:22:19] between you and the Lord I mean but in
[1:22:21] the time of David one of his sons Rose R
[1:22:24] up and
[1:22:26] Absalom and what did Absalom do
[1:22:29] amen he looked at how his daddy judged
[1:22:33] cases he looked at how his daddy advised
[1:22:36] people and he thought I can do better
[1:22:38] than
[1:22:39] that I think I can I can give a better
[1:22:44] word on that
[1:22:46] thing and he started saying out there if
[1:22:49] only I was King if only I was the pastor
[1:22:53] if only I was in in in in in control
[1:22:56] here then things have would have been
[1:22:57] different if only I if only I if only I
[1:23:00] how many abss do we have in the message
[1:23:03] today he had his own Ambitions maybe his
[1:23:06] own understanding perhaps his own
[1:23:08] perspective am mean perhaps he just
[1:23:10] completely different with how his dad
[1:23:12] handled
[1:23:17] things like I said sometimes I believe
[1:23:19] we have absalons in our church when God
[1:23:22] is using the minister when God is using
[1:23:24] using the pastor when God is using gifts
[1:23:26] in the church to deal with things
[1:23:28] sometimes the absolon because of the
[1:23:29] different understandings because of
[1:23:31] maybe the insecurities because of
[1:23:33] whatever reasons I mean they go in and
[1:23:35] actually work against what God is doing
[1:23:39] I mean sometimes God is saying take your
[1:23:42] hands off this gu so that I can deal
[1:23:43] with it and then abson would be de Oh
[1:23:46] Sister God loves you so much and
[1:23:48] actually maybe God is I mean God is
[1:23:50] actually dealing with with that person
[1:23:52] am mean and and now we can so easily say
[1:23:56] oh how do we get this right well easy
[1:23:58] but not so easy I mean easy the answer
[1:24:01] is easy and that is be led by the Holy
[1:24:04] Ghost amen be led by God Amen be led by
[1:24:08] what God leads you to do but genuinely
[1:24:11] make sure and this is the whole theme of
[1:24:13] today so I can kind of stop preaching
[1:24:15] now if you get this but when God
[1:24:18] genuinely put something on your heart
[1:24:20] not your own Zeal not your own idea not
[1:24:22] your own insecurity not press from
[1:24:24] others if God puts it on your heart then
[1:24:28] God will will work it all together then
[1:24:30] all the gifts in the church will go in
[1:24:32] exactly the same direction am mean then
[1:24:35] there's no pressures then there's no
[1:24:36] absalon's working against David's amen
[1:24:39] because then God is in control of all
[1:24:41] those gifts and then God is honoring or
[1:24:43] is honored and gets the glory from all
[1:24:45] those
[1:24:49] gifts am mean sometimes we have the
[1:24:51] voice of V visiting ministers and I'm
[1:24:53] kind of putting my myself in that box
[1:24:55] this morning I mean sometimes it's nice
[1:24:58] to hear the word just from a slightly
[1:25:00] different perspective you know sometimes
[1:25:01] for a pastor is it's like you know you
[1:25:05] preach something for months and months
[1:25:07] and months and then a visiting Minister
[1:25:08] comes and it preaches one service and a
[1:25:11] brother or sister comes to you brother
[1:25:12] did you hear that am me it's like well
[1:25:15] this what what I've been preaching for
[1:25:17] the last year but praise the Lord you
[1:25:19] got it amen hallelujah
[1:25:24] we have the voice of streaming and I
[1:25:27] know this is a sensitive subject
[1:25:29] amen The Challenge and there's a whole
[1:25:32] bunch of things and I'm not going to go
[1:25:33] into that in detail but that brother is
[1:25:36] dealing with something in the local
[1:25:39] church and God is actually sometimes the
[1:25:43] preaching when when a church is leaning
[1:25:45] that way God lets the ministry hang this
[1:25:48] way to pull them back to the middle and
[1:25:51] now maybe you are leaning this way and
[1:25:54] you streaming yeah brother amen preach
[1:25:56] it because he's amening me that's why
[1:26:00] I'm amening him back and actually maybe
[1:26:03] God wants to show you the other side of
[1:26:05] it amen there's sometimes things and and
[1:26:08] I know for some people this is really
[1:26:09] hard but I you know I'll give you a
[1:26:11] practical
[1:26:12] example um I preached something in in
[1:26:16] church and and something about um people
[1:26:20] studying and I spoke about how um
[1:26:24] in in where where we come from back in
[1:26:27] South Africa where um a generation ago
[1:26:30] how there was absolutely it was taboo to
[1:26:33] go study to do any tertiary studying at
[1:26:36] all and because brother Brandon makes
[1:26:38] the statements that you know the more
[1:26:40] you learn the further it takes you away
[1:26:42] from God and those things were pulled
[1:26:44] out of context and people 40 years later
[1:26:47] 50 years later they have they still have
[1:26:50] frustrations in their hearts that my
[1:26:52] brother-in-law for example he wanted to
[1:26:53] become a a teacher and his dad just
[1:26:56] refused because studying is of the
[1:26:58] devil there was an un unbalanced
[1:27:01] way and now I believe God is bringing
[1:27:05] that to the middle of the road and what
[1:27:06] I'm saying is studying per se for the
[1:27:09] right purposes the right um um you know
[1:27:12] if your motives are right and so forth
[1:27:14] is not it's not a bad thing per se
[1:27:16] obviously there's major issues with
[1:27:18] chucking your kids in a in a university
[1:27:21] Hostel at the other side of the world if
[1:27:22] they're not absolutely rooted and
[1:27:24] grounded and if if they haven't had the
[1:27:27] rebirth that is probably the worst place
[1:27:29] you can put them but the the point I was
[1:27:31] making is you know there's a there's a
[1:27:33] right balance to it there's nothing
[1:27:35] wrong per se with studying and then I
[1:27:38] traveled to another part of the country
[1:27:40] and had some fellowship with a brother
[1:27:42] and as we were sitting around a a coffee
[1:27:44] table in a in a little cafe the brother
[1:27:46] said praise the Lord our Minister that
[1:27:49] that ministered this week has blasted
[1:27:51] everyone for studying
[1:27:54] now I'm asking which of them is from
[1:27:57] God and I will happily say
[1:28:00] both because maybe in that church there
[1:28:03] was an unbalanced way around it and
[1:28:05] maybe they were you know completely
[1:28:07] overzealous on the making money and on
[1:28:10] on you know big incomes and comp
[1:28:11] competition and keeping up with the
[1:28:13] Joneses and all of that and maybe God
[1:28:15] was saying to them there's a balance to
[1:28:17] be gotten
[1:28:18] here so like I said if one of the people
[1:28:21] from from our assembly was streaming
[1:28:23] into that church amen they would have
[1:28:27] amen my pastor is talking garbage but
[1:28:30] actually it may be that God is telling
[1:28:33] you something but because you can now
[1:28:35] find someone else that agrees with your
[1:28:37] position it negates what God is actually
[1:28:40] trying to say to
[1:28:42] you I hope these things are okay brother
[1:28:45] Ben said I should take my
[1:28:46] Liberty amen so sometimes also some of
[1:28:51] the streaming ministers and we've seen a
[1:28:53] number of of very pertinent examples
[1:28:55] over the last years they start slowly
[1:28:59] going off the track slowly they slip in
[1:29:02] things that's not right and eventually
[1:29:05] they completely leave the
[1:29:08] message sometimes eventually they bring
[1:29:11] in completely false doctrines and things
[1:29:13] I mean every single false Doctrine among
[1:29:15] the message has started off with good
[1:29:19] intentions I mean
[1:29:22] and and I want to just say we need to be
[1:29:25] very very careful who we lean our ears
[1:29:29] down
[1:29:30] to am me who we allow to speak to
[1:29:34] us all those
[1:29:37] voices I refer to brother Bram strip to
[1:29:40] South Africa
[1:29:42] earlier he was there on God's command
[1:29:46] God pre-warned him amen that you're
[1:29:49] going to have a major trial when you get
[1:29:51] there he thought it was going to be some
[1:29:53] witch doctor was doing stuff or whatever
[1:29:56] amen but here he had clearcut indication
[1:30:00] the angel appeared to him and said go to
[1:30:02] deran amen the angel said spend two
[1:30:05] weeks in Johannesburg I think it was
[1:30:06] then go for a hunting trip to brother
[1:30:08] Sydney Jackson's farm for 10 days and
[1:30:10] then after that go to deran clearcut
[1:30:13] Angel gave him two specific
[1:30:16] signs and the Ministerial Association
[1:30:19] said no God told us otherwise we've set
[1:30:21] up this other routine and you have to go
[1:30:23] with it
[1:30:25] amen voices brother Bram stood in that
[1:30:28] place God's voice versus other people
[1:30:32] who actually said to him does God speak
[1:30:34] to only you and he said to them that's
[1:30:37] exactly what Kor said to Moses amen but
[1:30:40] still they wouldn't give him an inch and
[1:30:42] you know what God held him
[1:30:44] responsible God allowed his allowable
[1:30:47] his permissive amen but brother Adam
[1:30:49] suffered for it for months and months
[1:30:51] and months and months and months we read
[1:30:54] in the Bible that that sorry I hope I'm
[1:30:57] not creating too negative a picture here
[1:30:59] but I trust you'll see it come together
[1:31:00] later God willing we read in the Bible
[1:31:03] that story when jeroboam U made those
[1:31:06] two golden carves I think it was where
[1:31:08] where God sent that Prophet to prophesy
[1:31:11] against him and he prophesied and so
[1:31:13] forth and another Prophet came to him
[1:31:15] and said God said to me you must come to
[1:31:18] my home and he said God said to me I
[1:31:21] should go straight home no but God spoke
[1:31:23] to me
[1:31:25] too my brothers and sisters that's the
[1:31:27] most dangerous place to be in it's
[1:31:29] exactly where brother Brandon was there
[1:31:31] amen it's the most dangerous place to be
[1:31:34] until God doesn't tell me amen it
[1:31:38] doesn't help you saying God spoke to you
[1:31:39] it doesn't help you bringing signs and
[1:31:41] wonders God needs to tell me
[1:31:44] amen and eventually that Prophet
[1:31:47] listened to the other prophet and what
[1:31:49] happened was he was eaten by a lion the
[1:31:51] next day am mean and that other Prophet
[1:31:53] was sad
[1:31:55] and naturally speaking kindly thinking
[1:31:56] you think you could think well it's his
[1:31:58] fault no it's I believe God told him to
[1:32:00] do that because I believe God wanted to
[1:32:02] show us an example today God needs to
[1:32:05] tell you very
[1:32:09] clearly no matter what anyone else
[1:32:12] says and then there's a big one a big
[1:32:15] one that I think is probably the most
[1:32:17] pertinent one because of the greatest
[1:32:19] battle the voice of our own human
[1:32:22] spirit the voice of our own intellectual
[1:32:25] understanding the voice of how we see
[1:32:28] the word the
[1:32:30] voice of all our own hurts complexes
[1:32:34] emotional damage all those things the
[1:32:37] perspective at through which we judge
[1:32:40] things around
[1:32:42] us and
[1:32:44] often because we think something is
[1:32:47] right we believe it's God saying
[1:32:49] it and I'm sorry but not everything that
[1:32:52] comes in our mind is from from
[1:32:54] God I mean brother Bram tells the story
[1:32:57] in the church age book of St Martin when
[1:32:59] he was sitting there and the angel of
[1:33:01] Light appeared to him and said worship
[1:33:02] me St Martin I'm your
[1:33:04] God and he said it look the real deal
[1:33:08] except that because he knew the word he
[1:33:10] knew that ah this one was crowned and
[1:33:12] we're only going to crown him later amen
[1:33:14] and he said depart from me amen that's
[1:33:17] how fine it is my brothers and
[1:33:20] sisters today we are living in a voice
[1:33:23] in the day of a voice am mean
[1:33:25] Revelations 10 in the day of the voice
[1:33:27] of the seventh angel when all the
[1:33:29] mystery has been
[1:33:32] revealed but the reality is there's
[1:33:35] every single false Doctrine in the
[1:33:37] message believ they are the real message
[1:33:40] amen and from their perspective they
[1:33:43] believe that they've got it right and
[1:33:44] we've got it wrong amen and and the
[1:33:48] reality is from everyone's perspective
[1:33:50] they are you are in the middle of the
[1:33:52] road and everyone else is either the
[1:33:53] side off or that side
[1:33:55] off we need God Amen and and do not fear
[1:34:01] this is not about saying saying to you
[1:34:03] this is impossible because it's not
[1:34:04] impossible because there is a holy
[1:34:06] spirit there is a rebirth
[1:34:08] Hallelujah but your own understanding is
[1:34:12] a
[1:34:13] voice and sometimes that voice inside
[1:34:16] you is at odds with God's
[1:34:19] voice sometimes the voice of your
[1:34:21] understanding is at odds with the
[1:34:23] Revelation 10
[1:34:26] voice unfortunately when people switch
[1:34:29] on the message I've seen it over and
[1:34:31] over and over again they hear the
[1:34:34] message through their own
[1:34:36] filter they hear the message based on
[1:34:38] how they want it to sound amen and you
[1:34:41] know what it is impossible for you to
[1:34:46] explain it to
[1:34:47] someone in a different way than they
[1:34:49] believe
[1:34:50] it unless God comes on on the scene and
[1:34:54] he changes that person's understanding
[1:34:57] my brothers and sisters I strongly
[1:34:58] believe this is something Supernatural
[1:35:00] that we need with this word
[1:35:03] amen remember we've been speaking about
[1:35:06] people with different views only God can
[1:35:09] really pull that person to the middle of
[1:35:11] the road I'm saying me let me point the
[1:35:14] the the finger to me only God can keep
[1:35:16] me in the middle of the road when I go
[1:35:18] off amen because it's something that
[1:35:20] only he can do because I cannot judge my
[1:35:23] understanding from my understanding how
[1:35:25] do I do that I'm biased I mean of course
[1:35:28] I'm right I've always been right of
[1:35:30] course amen just everyone else has kind
[1:35:33] of wavered around am mean that's just
[1:35:36] how we human beings are am mean just
[1:35:38] prideful to start off
[1:35:43] with so we've spoken about a whole lot
[1:35:46] of
[1:35:47] voices and really a whole lot of
[1:35:50] teachers that are trying to teach us
[1:35:54] and like I said many times even though
[1:35:56] it comes with a message label it's
[1:35:59] actually inspired by
[1:36:02] Satan now you can very quickly be
[1:36:04] nervous when I say this kind of thing
[1:36:05] brother random says if it's 99% word and
[1:36:08] 1% hybrid it becomes
[1:36:12] satanic a Twist in the truth is no
[1:36:15] longer the
[1:36:21] truth I want to play short video clip to
[1:36:24] you and I'm sure most of you have seen
[1:36:26] it anyway
[1:36:29] but just wanted to show that
[1:36:36] principle all right ladies there it
[1:36:40] is there's three wires and three of us
[1:36:43] is that supposed to mean something yeah
[1:36:46] means we better be cutting one of these
[1:36:47] wires and we going to be all over this
[1:36:49] place I mean all over okay wait wait
[1:36:51] remember the captain was training us
[1:36:52] some bomb deactivation he specifically
[1:36:54] stressed you cut the red wire oh really
[1:36:57] well my captain taught us specifically
[1:36:59] to cut the blue wire red wire blue wire
[1:37:01] you both out HS everybody knows you cut
[1:37:03] the yellow wire yellow wire dude who's
[1:37:05] been teaching you does it really matter
[1:37:07] it certainly does at a time like this
[1:37:08] you better believe it I'm telling you
[1:37:10] it's the red wire blue wire look let's
[1:37:13] flip for it flip for it are you insane
[1:37:16] you cut the wrong wire here you'll be
[1:37:17] the one doing the flipping all over the
[1:37:19] place I mean all over I think you guys
[1:37:21] are making this thing bigger than what
[1:37:23] it is we got a minute and 12 seconds
[1:37:25] left I'm telling you it's the red wire
[1:37:27] maybe you're right guys I think I should
[1:37:31] tell you this now just in case it
[1:37:33] becomes an issue save the emotional
[1:37:35] stuff Vin there's plenty of time for
[1:37:36] that later I'm color blind color blind
[1:37:40] you're about as useful as a one-legged
[1:37:41] soccer player time is running out here
[1:37:44] I'm walking in on that I'm walking in on
[1:37:45] the red which one's the red one no no no
[1:37:47] no no no no what on Earth okay look
[1:37:51] let's just do this huh what you say it's
[1:37:54] the red one you say it's the yellow one
[1:37:57] and I say it's the blue one how about we
[1:37:59] each cut one
[1:38:01] what well one of them's got to be the
[1:38:03] one and two of them isn't that's the
[1:38:05] point big I'm telling you guys it's the
[1:38:07] red one but if we don't do something
[1:38:08] quick it's not really going to matter
[1:38:09] much I was taught it was red and I was
[1:38:12] taught it was blue I was taught it
[1:38:14] doesn't matter here we go
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:27] it's so important who teaches you
[1:38:31] because it will make the difference
[1:38:32] between life and
[1:38:35] death and like I said there's all those
[1:38:37] voices there's all these teachers
[1:38:39] there's all these
[1:38:43] influences when Jesus was about to leave
[1:38:46] the
[1:38:47] Earth what did he say the Holy Spirit
[1:38:50] would
[1:38:51] do he said but the comforter with which
[1:38:53] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:38:55] send in my name he shall teach you all
[1:38:58] things and bring all things to your
[1:39:01] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:39:03] you I mean he said I will send you the
[1:39:05] real teacher and he will be on the
[1:39:08] inside of the inside amen an inner
[1:39:12] teacher that's exactly what happened
[1:39:14] that Holy Spirit brought to their memory
[1:39:16] the things that Jesus said to the point
[1:39:18] where they could write the the the
[1:39:20] gospels down and so forth but it didn't
[1:39:22] stop their brothers and sisters amen he
[1:39:25] also taught them further he opened to
[1:39:28] them further amen he continued to break
[1:39:31] the word to those Apostles and they
[1:39:33] preached for years and years and years
[1:39:35] and years after three and a half years
[1:39:38] of teaching from
[1:39:39] Jesus amen that's why Paul could
[1:39:44] say now remember he never even met Jesus
[1:39:47] but I certify you Brethren that the
[1:39:48] gospel which was preached to me is not
[1:39:50] after man for I neither received it of
[1:39:53] neither was I taught it but by the
[1:39:55] revelation of Jesus
[1:39:59] Christ so the Holy Spirit was going to
[1:40:01] be the teacher through seven Church
[1:40:04] ages and he's still the teacher for you
[1:40:07] and me
[1:40:08] today amen and if we can get quiet
[1:40:10] enough to hear that still Small Voice
[1:40:14] that's where we want to be my brothers
[1:40:15] and
[1:40:17] sisters the Bride of every age will be
[1:40:20] tuned to hear to receive what he says to
[1:40:23] the the churches Amen in fact every
[1:40:26] letter to those seven Church ages says
[1:40:28] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:40:29] the spirit says to the churches what
[1:40:32] he's saying is let every individual
[1:40:34] that's predestinated in every age listen
[1:40:37] to that still small voice of what the
[1:40:39] teacher says inside of you because he
[1:40:42] will teach you amen praise the Lord
[1:40:45] Brother Bram says when Nicodemus came to
[1:40:47] him and Nicodemus called him a teacher
[1:40:49] sent from God I mean he says Jesus cut
[1:40:52] him s short and he says Jesus's words
[1:40:54] could be paraphrased like this I am not
[1:40:57] a teacher Hang on we're speaking about
[1:40:59] Jesus here amen he says I'm not a
[1:41:01] teacher I'm am the sacrificial lamb for
[1:41:03] sin I am making possible the New Birth
[1:41:06] by my spirit but there's a coming one
[1:41:08] who is the teacher he is the holy spirit
[1:41:12] when Jesus was upon the Earth he came as
[1:41:13] the lamb and as the prophet but when he
[1:41:15] came back upon the church by his Spirit
[1:41:17] he became the teacher and that's the
[1:41:20] teacher we need
[1:41:23] amen that Holy Spirit and I'll put it in
[1:41:26] message terms now that said I'm going to
[1:41:29] ride this triail once more he's doing it
[1:41:32] we're not waiting for Brother brandom to
[1:41:34] come back amen the prophet has decreased
[1:41:38] he has increased he's now riding this TR
[1:41:41] once more he's now personally my
[1:41:43] brothers and sisters teaching his
[1:41:45] precious bride he's personally revealing
[1:41:47] to us his word now inside of
[1:41:50] us am mean there's a certain class of
[1:41:52] people people that's predestinated to
[1:41:54] hear not a class that's better than
[1:41:56] anyone amen not a class that's more
[1:41:59] important that's not a class that can
[1:42:01] look down on anyone there's not a class
[1:42:03] that can become prideful or anything but
[1:42:05] there's a predestinated group of people
[1:42:08] am mean while the rest of the people
[1:42:10] cannot under any circumstances receive
[1:42:13] the full word this class
[1:42:18] does brother bam says it is absolutely
[1:42:22] impossible for all men to hear what the
[1:42:24] spirit says to the different ages
[1:42:27] absolutely
[1:42:30] impossible but only that elected group
[1:42:33] can hear it and will hear
[1:42:35] it am mean this cannot be fixed with
[1:42:38] better ear doctors this cannot be fixed
[1:42:40] this is nothing to do with our natural
[1:42:42] hearing remember many of these voices we
[1:42:45] spoke about is not natural voices amen
[1:42:49] it's voices that's built into our
[1:42:51] Spirits amen our culture our
[1:42:53] understanding our thinking patterns our
[1:42:56] conscience our pride our hurts our
[1:42:58] complexes all those things amen we need
[1:43:01] something stronger than all those things
[1:43:03] and he is stronger than all those things
[1:43:06] Hallelujah this isn't about the ability
[1:43:09] to hear naturally it's not there it's
[1:43:12] not about going to the doctor and doing
[1:43:13] a hearing test my brothers and sisters
[1:43:15] it's got nothing to do with that amen
[1:43:18] when Jesus's disciple disciples asked
[1:43:21] him why he was teaching in parables
[1:43:24] am mean he answered them in this
[1:43:27] way says therefore speak I to them in
[1:43:29] Parables because they seeing see not and
[1:43:32] hearing they hear not neither do they
[1:43:35] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[1:43:37] prophecy of Isaiah which says by hearing
[1:43:39] you shall hear and shall not understand
[1:43:41] and seeing you shall see and shall not
[1:43:43] perceive for this people's heart is
[1:43:45] waxed gross and the ears are dull of
[1:43:46] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[1:43:48] lest at any time they would should see
[1:43:50] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[1:43:52] and should understand stand with their
[1:43:53] heart and should be converted and I
[1:43:55] should heal them but blessed are your
[1:43:57] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:44:02] here hallelujah I wonder if we can turn
[1:44:06] together to to 1 Corinthians
[1:44:11] 2 excuse
[1:44:20] me Paul writing to the Corinthian ch Now
[1:44:23] 1 Corinthians 2 and we'll start from
[1:44:24] verse
[1:44:26] 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:44:29] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[1:44:30] this world nor the princes of this world
[1:44:33] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[1:44:36] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[1:44:38] wisdom which God ordained before the
[1:44:41] world unto our Glory which none of the
[1:44:44] princes of this world knew for had they
[1:44:45] known it they would not have crucified
[1:44:47] the Lord Of Glory but as it is written
[1:44:49] eye hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither
[1:44:52] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:44:54] things which God has prepared for them
[1:44:56] that love
[1:44:57] him but God Amen has revealed them unto
[1:45:02] us by his spirit for the spirit searches
[1:45:05] all things yay the Deep things of God
[1:45:08] hallelujah again that inner teacher my
[1:45:10] brothers and sisters verse 11 for what
[1:45:12] man knoweth the things of man save the
[1:45:14] spirit of man which is in him even so
[1:45:17] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[1:45:20] spirit of God
[1:45:24] no earthly messenger unless the Heavenly
[1:45:27] messenger meets him no earthly voice
[1:45:30] unless God is actually using that voice
[1:45:35] amen now we have received not the spirit
[1:45:38] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:45:39] god that we might know the things that
[1:45:42] are freely given to us of God Amen
[1:45:45] without fussing and stewing and breaking
[1:45:47] our heads about it God freely gives them
[1:45:49] to his elected Hallelujah which things
[1:45:53] also we speak not in Words which man's
[1:45:55] Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[1:45:57] teaches comparing spiritual things with
[1:46:00] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:46:02] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:46:04] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:46:06] can he know them because they are
[1:46:07] spiritually discerned but he that is
[1:46:10] spiritual judges all things yet he
[1:46:12] himself is judged of no man for who ha
[1:46:15] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[1:46:17] instruct
[1:46:18] him but we have the mind of Christ
[1:46:25] Hallelujah so what we speaking about my
[1:46:28] brothers and sisters is a spiritual
[1:46:31] discernment amen there's a few things I
[1:46:34] want to highlight about this ability to
[1:46:38] hear first of all it's only to
[1:46:40] predestinated people whose origin is God
[1:46:44] we come from God Amen we came out of God
[1:46:48] Amen our origin our origin is God and
[1:46:53] therefore we can hear God Amen the
[1:46:56] second thing is it's only the spirit of
[1:46:58] God in us by the spirit of God in us
[1:47:01] that we know his word our Human Side my
[1:47:03] brothers and sisters we have nothing to
[1:47:05] boast about am mean we're not more
[1:47:07] clever we're not better we're not
[1:47:09] cleaner we're not we're not less born in
[1:47:11] sin shaped in iniquity amen it's all his
[1:47:15] grace and it's only by his spirit in us
[1:47:18] and thirdly it's not understood by the
[1:47:20] natural man
[1:47:23] now I believe there's two sides of that
[1:47:24] amen first of all only the spiritual the
[1:47:28] spiritually predestinated people can
[1:47:30] really receive this word but also
[1:47:33] there's a very important part amen it's
[1:47:36] actually only the real you inside that
[1:47:39] completely receives the
[1:47:40] word our body and our human spirit I
[1:47:44] mean there's so much that we don't
[1:47:47] understand but still something inside us
[1:47:49] says yes Lord even though I don't
[1:47:52] understand it it am mean I believe it
[1:47:54] with all my heart am mean there's a song
[1:47:57] that says I you don't have to understand
[1:48:02] you just have to hold his hand amen yeah
[1:48:06] we're not saying that okay so don't
[1:48:08] study the message that's what I'm saying
[1:48:10] but what I'm saying is it's not about
[1:48:12] your intellect it's not about you being
[1:48:14] able to explain everything in the word
[1:48:17] but it's it's it's about meeting the
[1:48:19] author and the author that spiritual
[1:48:22] teacher inside of you making the word
[1:48:24] alive and known to us in in our
[1:48:28] inside amen then there's the opposite
[1:48:31] group we read bit about that in John 8
[1:48:34] Jesus said unto them if God were your
[1:48:36] father I mean speaking to the Pharisees
[1:48:38] now if God were your father you would
[1:48:39] love me for I proceeded forth and came
[1:48:41] from God neither came I of myself but he
[1:48:44] sent me why do you not understand my
[1:48:47] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:48:51] word hang on Jesus we are standing here
[1:48:53] we listening to you but that's not what
[1:48:56] he's speaking about he's saying you
[1:48:58] don't have that inner teacher you don't
[1:49:00] have that predestinated ability to hear
[1:49:02] me he said you are of the Father the
[1:49:05] devil and the lusts of your father you
[1:49:07] will do he was a murderer from the
[1:49:09] beginning and Abode not in the
[1:49:13] truth excuse me because there's no truth
[1:49:16] in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:49:18] speaketh of his own for he's a liar and
[1:49:21] the father of it amen I mean there's
[1:49:23] that separate
[1:49:24] group now for that group they have some
[1:49:28] attributes they don't have God as their
[1:49:30] origin obviously the opposite amen
[1:49:33] they're Guided by the spirit of Satan
[1:49:35] and the tree of
[1:49:36] knowledge and this is so sometimes it's
[1:49:40] tend to say these kind of things but
[1:49:42] brothers and sisters there's people in
[1:49:43] this message claiming to be in the
[1:49:46] message that's only eating from the Tree
[1:49:49] of
[1:49:50] knowledge the intellectual understand
[1:49:52] understanding of
[1:49:54] how the different things fit
[1:49:57] together Hallelujah I trust that's okay
[1:50:01] some people can only understand
[1:50:08] naturally so obviously it won't help us
[1:50:10] to keep on growing bigger ears amen
[1:50:14] that's not the type of hearing that God
[1:50:16] is
[1:50:18] after here we
[1:50:20] go amen God is broadcasting his word
[1:50:24] perfectly
[1:50:27] clearly because that's his business to
[1:50:29] do
[1:50:31] it but there's nothing you can do to
[1:50:34] make yourself genuinely receive and hear
[1:50:37] that
[1:50:39] word what we need is a spiritual
[1:50:43] antenna that's in tune with the word of
[1:50:50] God can you get the audio up
[1:50:57] if your receiver is not tuned to receive
[1:51:00] it you can't receive
[1:51:03] it and that doesn't say there's anything
[1:51:05] wrong with the transmitter the
[1:51:06] transmitter is transmitting perfect amen
[1:51:09] God's word has been expressed God's word
[1:51:11] has been released straight out to us
[1:51:14] amen there's nothing wrong with God's
[1:51:17] side but on our side oops are we gone
[1:51:26] okay on our side when we get in tune
[1:51:29] with the word am mean we receive if we
[1:51:32] get in tune with God and there's only
[1:51:35] one thing that makes us or that gives us
[1:51:38] the ability to receive brother R speaks
[1:51:40] about that Crystal amen you know what
[1:51:42] the crystal in our hearts is okay so
[1:51:45] there's the radio transmitting at the
[1:51:47] wrong
[1:51:48] frequency when we tune in we start
[1:51:51] hearing the truth
[1:51:53] amen let me start
[1:51:58] receiving the crystal in our heart that
[1:52:00] gives us the ability to receive my
[1:52:02] brothers and
[1:52:03] sisters is the C Gene of God Amen is
[1:52:07] that predestinated c Gene of what God
[1:52:09] placed in us from the
[1:52:12] beginning brother Bron makes this
[1:52:14] statement he says it's most evident from
[1:52:16] these scriptures that no man of himself
[1:52:18] can hear
[1:52:19] God come on let's get that really in our
[1:52:23] minds no man of himself can hear God
[1:52:28] that ability has to be given to him of
[1:52:30] God I mean the Bible speaks about how by
[1:52:33] thinking you can't add a foot to your to
[1:52:35] your stature or however that scripture
[1:52:37] is I mean the point is you can't make
[1:52:40] yourself better you can't make yourself
[1:52:42] uh uh get Revelation you can't make
[1:52:45] yourself grow closer to God by your own
[1:52:47] effort there's only one way he has to
[1:52:51] draw and you have to submit you die to
[1:52:55] yourself and you say God nothing in my
[1:52:57] hands I bring simply to your cross I
[1:52:59] cllean amen and when by God's grace
[1:53:03] those voices can dim out in the
[1:53:05] background and you can start hearing
[1:53:06] that still Small Voice that's what it's
[1:53:09] about amen Jesus confirms
[1:53:14] this with Simon with Peter he said
[1:53:17] blessed are th Simon by Jonah for Flesh
[1:53:19] and Blood ha not revealed it unto you
[1:53:21] but my father Father which is in heaven
[1:53:24] brother Ram actually makes a statement
[1:53:25] he says when Jesus and Peter was
[1:53:27] speaking and Jesus caught that
[1:53:30] Revelation go um Jesus knew sorry when
[1:53:33] when Peter caught that Revelation Jesus
[1:53:35] knew that this was more than just a
[1:53:37] natural understanding amen when Peter
[1:53:40] responded in the way he did amen I
[1:53:43] believe Jesus's heart swelled up and
[1:53:45] says praise the Lord someone has
[1:53:47] received a revelation directly from God
[1:53:50] Amen and that my brother and sister
[1:53:52] sister is what every son and daughter
[1:53:54] needs today that same
[1:53:57] Revelation and there is a group of
[1:53:59] people that can receive that's been
[1:54:00] predestinated to receive that has the
[1:54:03] spirit of God and who are born of God in
[1:54:06] other words the children of
[1:54:09] God the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:54:12] when someone is taught by that inner
[1:54:14] teacher amen someone that receives and
[1:54:18] hears and sees the word for your day and
[1:54:22] in its season brother Bram is very clear
[1:54:24] about those things I mean the evidence
[1:54:26] is genuinely hearing what the spirit
[1:54:29] says to you
[1:54:32] person however there's a challenge with
[1:54:34] that because many people in message
[1:54:36] circles claim to have the rebirth
[1:54:39] because they can explain the message
[1:54:41] that's not what it's about it's not just
[1:54:44] because you can explain the seven
[1:54:45] everything amen I love the seven
[1:54:48] everything it's because it's Revelation
[1:54:50] it's so dear to me amen but but what I'm
[1:54:52] saying is just to be able to explain it
[1:54:55] does not say that you've got the rebirth
[1:54:57] the rebirth is when the word takes over
[1:55:00] your life when the word starts living
[1:55:03] itself out through you and that's
[1:55:05] Revelation that's not human attempt
[1:55:07] that's not us pretending that's not make
[1:55:10] belief that's not us trying to be better
[1:55:11] than the next one or better than
[1:55:13] ourselves I mean that's when God comes
[1:55:15] on the scene and God does it for you and
[1:55:17] God reveals it to you I've seen it so
[1:55:20] many times people claim to have the Holy
[1:55:22] Spirit just because they can understand
[1:55:24] the
[1:55:25] message but if all you have is an
[1:55:27] intellectual understanding my brothers
[1:55:28] and sisters it's not going to get you in
[1:55:30] the Rapture you need faith and Faith
[1:55:34] Comes only by Revelation personal very
[1:55:36] personal in individual revelation of
[1:55:39] what God did for
[1:55:41] you and what God is going to do for you
[1:55:45] when it comes to the time of the body
[1:55:46] change amen like like Enoch that you can
[1:55:50] just take another step amen it's not
[1:55:52] suddenly oh goodness there's something
[1:55:54] got to happen he just took another step
[1:55:56] am mean because he was in that
[1:55:57] relationship with
[1:56:01] God brother Bram says when scripture
[1:56:03] teaches us that the work of the Holy
[1:56:05] Spirit and the manifestation of that
[1:56:07] blessed person is to bring the truth of
[1:56:08] each age to the true seed of that age
[1:56:11] then we know that the spirit has to be
[1:56:13] abiding in the person or he cannot
[1:56:16] receive the truth for that time that's
[1:56:18] exactly correct and if these ages bring
[1:56:20] out anything they surely bring and bear
[1:56:22] out this truth you need the holy spirit
[1:56:25] inside to
[1:56:27] receive that's why I emphasized for
[1:56:30] every age I I'll move away from these
[1:56:32] things soon but I trust that you have it
[1:56:34] amen but that's why he emphasizes to
[1:56:37] every age you are so and so and this is
[1:56:40] your attributes and I see your works and
[1:56:43] I see your suffering and I see your
[1:56:44] labor and all those things and many
[1:56:46] identifies that he says but for every
[1:56:48] age amen every age those with a
[1:56:52] spiritual hearing will hear what the
[1:56:54] spirit says to the
[1:56:57] churches you can say well I believe the
[1:57:00] message but if all you have is that
[1:57:02] intellectual understanding it won't do
[1:57:05] you any more good than saying Jesus
[1:57:08] Christ died 2,000 years
[1:57:10] ago hey so many people says that Jesus
[1:57:13] Christ died 2,000 years ago you can read
[1:57:15] it in Joseph's historical writing and he
[1:57:17] doesn't even believe in Jesus amen and
[1:57:20] he believed it when he wrote it but the
[1:57:22] point is brothers and sisters if God
[1:57:24] reveals to you the significance the
[1:57:27] personal application of that that's
[1:57:29] where it comes amen until that
[1:57:32] historical fact becomes a personal and
[1:57:34] tangible reality for you that starts
[1:57:38] driving your thinking from the
[1:57:40] inside that starts impacting on how you
[1:57:43] look at other people around you how you
[1:57:45] look at the word how you look at
[1:57:47] circumstances how you respond when
[1:57:49] things in life are thrown in your
[1:57:51] direction
[1:57:52] until that point it means nothing to
[1:57:55] just understand
[1:57:57] it James wrote what brother bam quoted
[1:58:00] quite a few times thou believest that
[1:58:03] there is one God thou doest well the
[1:58:05] Devils also believe and
[1:58:07] tremble that pops the balloom quickly
[1:58:10] doesn't it but will thou know oh vain
[1:58:12] man that faith without works is dead if
[1:58:15] you genuinely have a revelation Works
[1:58:18] Will Follow The Life of Christ will be
[1:58:21] lived out through you
[1:58:27] brother BR says he told us the evidence
[1:58:29] of what would happen after being
[1:58:30] baptized with the Holy Spirit was that
[1:58:32] we would have the teacher come and teach
[1:58:34] us all truth but that teacher was an
[1:58:37] inside teacher not an outside teacher if
[1:58:39] the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[1:58:41] hear the truth and receive it by
[1:58:43] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[1:58:45] of the
[1:58:47] day I want to put it this way and and
[1:58:49] and again this can sound like I'm
[1:58:52] actually saying a negative thing about
[1:58:53] it but you can have brother bram's
[1:58:55] message playing 24/7 in your house walk
[1:58:58] with it in your ears 247 but until the
[1:59:01] inner teacher makes it alive it won't
[1:59:04] benefit
[1:59:05] you now I'm not saying it's bad to do
[1:59:07] that of course go on do it by all means
[1:59:10] amen but what I'm saying is is all if
[1:59:12] all you hear is words being expressed
[1:59:14] it's not going to help
[1:59:18] you in every age in every age is the age
[1:59:20] of the Holy Ghost for the true believer
[1:59:22] I say in every age the evidence was the
[1:59:25] same those who had the spirit the
[1:59:27] teacher heard the word and that spirit
[1:59:29] in them took the word and taught it
[1:59:32] revealed it to them and they were of the
[1:59:34] group that heard the messenger and his
[1:59:36] message and took it and lived it it
[1:59:39] lived itself out through them now you
[1:59:42] cannot cut that quote in two amen you
[1:59:45] can't just take the first part amen the
[1:59:48] spirit in them took the word and thought
[1:59:50] it the other part is also amen they
[1:59:53] lived it it made itself manifest in
[1:59:56] their
[1:59:57] life we cannot live this word by sheer
[2:00:00] will I mean brother Bram says there's
[2:00:02] many Christian signs that live better
[2:00:04] lives than people with a true Holy Ghost
[2:00:09] baptism you cannot add to the word or
[2:00:11] take away from it and still claim to
[2:00:14] have the Holy Ghost but that teacher
[2:00:16] needs to come on the inside and
[2:00:18] personally reveal it to
[2:00:20] us hallelujah
[2:00:23] so I want to put it in this in this kind
[2:00:24] of terminology in this time when the
[2:00:27] seventh seal is open now which we
[2:00:30] believe it is
[2:00:32] amen when our bridegroom is here
[2:00:35] now what is Jacob saying to Rebecca in
[2:00:39] the
[2:00:40] tent or in other words what is Jesus
[2:00:43] saying to you personally in your tent in
[2:00:46] your
[2:00:49] Tabernacle I want to speak about one
[2:00:51] more teacher and then I want to get to
[2:00:53] the point that I that I really wanted to
[2:00:55] build up
[2:01:00] to there's one more teacher that brother
[2:01:02] Bram speaks about and that is your
[2:01:20] theophan and one John 1:14 how the word
[2:01:23] became flesh and belt Among
[2:01:26] Us brother Ram speaks about how the
[2:01:29] first expression that came out of God
[2:01:31] was the logos the word amen now that
[2:01:34] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[2:01:37] that was the
[2:01:38] logos the word was the first expression
[2:01:41] of God I mean brother bam he puts it in
[2:01:44] this way he says that logos it was the
[2:01:47] first expression out of out you know
[2:01:49] before that was just that spirit being
[2:01:51] that f time and space and our human
[2:01:53] Minds couldn't even uh cope with trying
[2:01:57] to imagine what it's like because we
[2:01:59] can't imagine space big enough we
[2:02:02] couldn't imagine time far enough amen so
[2:02:05] God expressed himself in word form in
[2:02:07] low God form so that we as human beings
[2:02:10] could start relate Amen to how he was
[2:02:13] but there's another part of that brother
[2:02:15] bam says the thought that was in God's
[2:02:18] uh inside of God in that spirit of God
[2:02:20] was now expressed in word form and
[2:02:23] remember how it works it's thought
[2:02:27] words
[2:02:29] manifestation now if you look at Jesus
[2:02:32] he was the manifestation of the logos so
[2:02:36] eternal spirit logos expression Jesus I
[2:02:40] hope I'm not going to fuss but I'm sure
[2:02:42] we all know these things amen now
[2:02:45] brother Brandon makes this statement he
[2:02:47] says his first being was Spirit God
[2:02:49] Supernatural all right the great eternal
[2:02:51] second he begin to form himself towards
[2:02:54] flesh in a theophany it's called the
[2:02:56] word a body this is when it then this
[2:03:00] thing is the state he was in when he met
[2:03:01] Abraham he was called MDC he was in the
[2:03:04] form of theophany now we get into that
[2:03:06] and prove it in a few minutes the Lord
[2:03:07] willing he was the word a theophany is
[2:03:10] something that you could not see it
[2:03:12] could be right here now yet you cannot
[2:03:14] see it it's just like well like
[2:03:17] television that's in another dimension
[2:03:20] television people are moving right
[2:03:21] through this room now singing There's
[2:03:23] colors also but the eye is only subject
[2:03:25] to the five senses your whole being is
[2:03:27] only subject to Five Senses rather and
[2:03:29] you are only subject to what the site
[2:03:31] has been limited to see but there's
[2:03:32] another dimension that can be seen by
[2:03:35] transformation by
[2:03:36] television now why I put this up was the
[2:03:40] logos was God's theopen amen the logos
[2:03:45] was God's word expression our theophonic
[2:03:53] now we don't have time to spend a lot of
[2:03:54] time on that but there's just one or two
[2:03:56] things I would like to say about that
[2:03:58] theophany Amen brother Ram speaks about
[2:04:00] how that um we become subject to the
[2:04:04] word when we get the
[2:04:08] rebirth brother R speaks about how the
[2:04:10] holy spirit is not bringing us uh that
[2:04:12] if the holy spirit is not bringing us to
[2:04:14] the middle of the
[2:04:16] road amen it might not be the Holy
[2:04:20] Spirit he speaks about how that
[2:04:30] theophyl enters that body is what
[2:04:32] brother Adam shows us now he says that
[2:04:34] theophany is hanging around us now and
[2:04:37] by the time it's either our death or our
[2:04:39] body change we step over into that
[2:04:42] theophany but and here's the point I
[2:04:44] really want to get to he speaks about
[2:04:47] how we start hearing from our theophany
[2:04:50] now there's a beauty Beau beautiful
[2:04:52] principle there that you know these
[2:04:54] things can be so conceptual that it's
[2:04:56] kind of I don't want to say meaningless
[2:04:58] but it doesn't become
[2:04:59] personal but what I want to say is you
[2:05:03] had an attribute in God's mind if you
[2:05:06] believe you predestinated in God's mind
[2:05:08] there was something that he had an
[2:05:10] attribute of you that he wanted to
[2:05:13] express and then that thought became
[2:05:17] word and the word expression of your
[2:05:20] attribute is your theophonic
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:51] Amen to where God intended you to be if
[2:05:54] we put it in completely different terms
[2:05:57] God had a vision for you very personal
[2:06:00] very specific very directly for you and
[2:06:03] for me amen and that theophany I believe
[2:06:06] is the one that leads us into that
[2:06:08] purpose that leads us to fulfill that
[2:06:12] purpose I mean brother brandom speaks
[2:06:15] about just going to quote this here we
[2:06:17] refers to that term and after you
[2:06:19] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[2:06:21] food then you left the other thing you
[2:06:23] have then been formed into the living
[2:06:25] image of the Living God you heard from
[2:06:27] your theophany if this Earthly body be
[2:06:29] dissolved we have one waiting he refers
[2:06:31] to that in so many places where he says
[2:06:34] when we die our theophany is there or
[2:06:36] when we go in the body change and so
[2:06:39] forth so in other words your personal
[2:06:42] word attribute that's an expression of
[2:06:44] the Eternal thoughts of God thoughts
[2:06:46] that have become word will speak
[2:06:48] directly and personally to
[2:06:50] you it will influence your
[2:06:53] soul to have
[2:06:55] faith it will influence your soul to
[2:06:58] believe the word completely in a soul
[2:07:00] realm now amen we're not talking about
[2:07:03] just an intellectual understanding but I
[2:07:05] believe it also will start from the
[2:07:08] heart from the Throne of your soul start
[2:07:10] impacting your human spirit amen to cast
[2:07:14] out everything that doesn't align with
[2:07:16] the word will the battle stop never bad
[2:07:20] news but good good news too amen we
[2:07:23] looking forward to that body change amen
[2:07:25] but that battle will never stop but from
[2:07:27] that Throne he will start influencing
[2:07:29] you amen and depending on which dog we
[2:07:32] feed that depend that determines which
[2:07:34] side we lean to amen our imaginations
[2:07:37] our understanding our conscience Etc I
[2:07:40] believe will be influenced by The
[2:07:42] Guiding of that uh leadership and our
[2:07:46] body will start expressing the faith
[2:07:49] that's on the inside because we read
[2:07:52] Works without faith is
[2:07:55] dead the title to this message could
[2:07:57] also have been what your theopen he sees
[2:08:00] to you amen and that's really where I
[2:08:02] wanted to come so now I just want to
[2:08:04] look at a few practical applications and
[2:08:06] I hope you have a few minutes for me to
[2:08:08] to just go through these things I hope
[2:08:10] you're not getting too tired and
[2:08:12] restless but but really there's a few
[2:08:14] practical things that that I believe the
[2:08:16] Lord really placed on my heart to to go
[2:08:18] to this morning
[2:08:21] we want to be in the middle of the road
[2:08:23] Amen brother Bram speaks about how we
[2:08:25] can so quickly go off on one side and go
[2:08:27] off on another side we want to be in the
[2:08:29] middle of the road with everything and
[2:08:32] with all the
[2:08:33] voices what I want is that I want to
[2:08:37] hear what God is saying to me and
[2:08:40] remember we spoke about how important it
[2:08:42] is that we don't go on what the next
[2:08:44] person says how the next person look at
[2:08:46] something but what God is saying to me
[2:08:50] personally amen based on where each of
[2:08:52] us are at and based on the other voices
[2:08:54] in our lives but especially our own
[2:08:57] understanding and perspectives each one
[2:08:59] of us needs to ask God to help us to
[2:09:01] listen to what he is saying to us
[2:09:05] individually I mean like I said we all
[2:09:08] think our own balance is the right
[2:09:09] balance we all think we're in the middle
[2:09:11] of the road we tend to think that you
[2:09:13] know others need to line up with our
[2:09:15] thinking but sometimes we need to align
[2:09:18] with God's
[2:09:19] thinking and I'm going to share a little
[2:09:21] secret with you this is probably one of
[2:09:23] the
[2:09:24] most difficult things for a pastor or a
[2:09:27] minister because like I said there's so
[2:09:30] many voices the pastor can preach it the
[2:09:32] minister can preach it in a specific way
[2:09:35] am mean and when some people are leaning
[2:09:36] this way you preach it that way to bring
[2:09:39] them to the middle and then what happens
[2:09:42] is all they do is they go stream brother
[2:09:44] so and so that's preaching it that way
[2:09:46] so Amen brother preacher instead of
[2:09:48] hearing to what the Lord is saying or
[2:09:51] you go preach it this way and they
[2:09:53] leaning that way but brothers so and so
[2:09:55] in Church Fellowship with them after
[2:09:57] church and N don't worry about that amen
[2:10:00] so many voices I hope it's okay to share
[2:10:02] these things but it's very realistic
[2:10:04] very real
[2:10:06] amen now we read in Corinthians Paul's
[2:10:09] puts those things in in place and so
[2:10:11] forth when they're speaking in tongues
[2:10:12] and all those things brother Bram
[2:10:14] thought us so clearly there's there's
[2:10:16] something that the churches have
[2:10:17] abandoned I mean the Pentecostal
[2:10:19] churches that's become just a big mess
[2:10:21] of speaking in tongues and just everyone
[2:10:23] do their own thing there's an important
[2:10:25] part that they forget spiritual
[2:10:27] discernment amen all those gifts need to
[2:10:30] be subject to spiritual discernment amen
[2:10:34] someone with genuine Holy Ghost
[2:10:36] discernment to say is it of God or isn't
[2:10:38] it brother bam speaks about how we don't
[2:10:41] just receive a message that anyone jump
[2:10:43] up and give to the church we need two or
[2:10:45] three witnesses that this is of God we
[2:10:48] need that discernment
[2:10:51] now I believe now the Bible speaks about
[2:10:54] now if that in fact brother Bron makes a
[2:10:56] statement he says if that if that
[2:10:58] speaking in tongues is wrong and the
[2:11:00] discernment find it finds it's wrong or
[2:11:03] if the discernment thinks it's right and
[2:11:04] it proves excuse me proves to be wrong
[2:11:07] he says then you've got an evil spirit
[2:11:08] among you amen then you need to go on
[2:11:10] your knees and ask God to take that
[2:11:12] Spirit out from among
[2:11:15] us but unfortunately sometimes we just
[2:11:19] accept everything everyone says to us us
[2:11:22] everyone's opinions everyone's
[2:11:23] imbalances everyone's perspectives based
[2:11:26] on where they come from based on all
[2:11:27] those voices that we spoke
[2:11:31] about I've seen our insecurities sorry
[2:11:34] how insecure
[2:11:36] people get flattened Under Pressure like
[2:11:39] this trying to be men Pleasers trying to
[2:11:42] hear every voice that comes their way
[2:11:44] and trying to keep everyone
[2:11:47] happy I'm sure some of you have
[2:11:49] experienced some of these things it's
[2:11:50] very real brother so and so comes visits
[2:11:53] and you know you're only spiritual if
[2:11:55] you can do this and sister so and so
[2:11:56] come visits and you're only spiritual if
[2:11:58] you can do that and all this or you
[2:12:00] stream this um brother here and you
[2:12:02] stream that brother there sorry I'm not
[2:12:04] I'm not fighting streaming I mean that's
[2:12:06] between you and the Lord amen I'm just
[2:12:07] saying there's pet Falls in there that
[2:12:09] we need to be very careful for amen we
[2:12:13] need to find what God is saying to you
[2:12:16] personally and sometimes we just want to
[2:12:18] be men Pleasers we just want to do
[2:12:20] everything that we here instead of
[2:12:22] discerning is this for
[2:12:25] me am mean the Bible speaks about people
[2:12:27] being blown away by every wind of
[2:12:29] Doctrine amen come on that's what the
[2:12:32] Holy Ghost is for that's what God is for
[2:12:35] I mean what you need to find out is what
[2:12:38] God is saying to
[2:12:41] you not to someone
[2:12:44] else you know sometimes we sit in church
[2:12:46] and we when we hear something come over
[2:12:49] the pulpit I hope sister so and so is
[2:12:51] listening I hope brother so and so is
[2:12:52] listening amen but what's God saying to
[2:12:56] me we can so easily miss our
[2:13:00] message amen even though we all believe
[2:13:02] in this message and we say we believe in
[2:13:04] the message we come from all those
[2:13:06] different backgrounds I mean brother
[2:13:08] Bram summarizes the the difficulty in a
[2:13:11] minister speaking in this way he says
[2:13:13] these things was all in my mind you can
[2:13:14] imagine what's in a man's heart when you
[2:13:16] put up with that seat to think of what
[2:13:18] is taking place and know to tell the
[2:13:20] people know KN that some will get the
[2:13:22] wrong slant and some will go this way
[2:13:24] and that way and you know how it is some
[2:13:27] will believe and some won't but that's
[2:13:29] what you have to put up with how can you
[2:13:31] say it without hurting how can you say
[2:13:33] it that it will take effect how can you
[2:13:36] say it to show the people that you're
[2:13:37] not picking on them that you love them
[2:13:39] how can you be strict and firm and yet
[2:13:41] loving oh how you going to present it
[2:13:43] and then woe woe onto me if I don't
[2:13:46] present it see it summarizes how a
[2:13:48] minister I mean God put something on
[2:13:50] your heart but but also there's another
[2:13:51] part of that there's no way I can force
[2:13:55] any thought into anyone's
[2:13:59] head if God doesn't open it to that
[2:14:03] individual there's nothing I can
[2:14:07] do just some of my practical work
[2:14:09] experience I worked as a project manager
[2:14:11] for quite a few years here in New
[2:14:13] Zealand and you know I I sometimes it
[2:14:17] was just so hard my team I mean I would
[2:14:21] I would ask to someone I I would ask
[2:14:23] someone to do something and two or 3
[2:14:25] days later they come and they they've
[2:14:27] done something completely
[2:14:30] different they've completely
[2:14:32] misunderstood what I
[2:14:34] said and if I go back at what I said and
[2:14:37] what they understood I said I can see
[2:14:41] how they understood it based on their
[2:14:43] preconceived ideas and I got to a point
[2:14:46] where if I gave my team a task that
[2:14:48] that's going to take them longer than
[2:14:50] just a few hours I would actually say to
[2:14:51] them explain back to me what you think
[2:14:53] I've just said to you and so often they
[2:14:56] would explain it completely different
[2:14:58] and would say no no no you thought that
[2:15:00] in your head that's not what I said
[2:15:03] that's just human beings now in the
[2:15:06] church setting you have an extra thing
[2:15:08] against you because Satan will do
[2:15:10] everything in his in his power to fight
[2:15:12] against you to twist it to abuse it so
[2:15:16] that you get the wrong slant
[2:15:18] amen I cannot make as a minister cannot
[2:15:21] make you see it the way I see it amen
[2:15:24] but praise the lord it's not important
[2:15:25] that you see it how I see it it's
[2:15:27] important that the Holy Spirit teaches
[2:15:29] you personally how he wants you to see
[2:15:32] it that's for me that's one of the most
[2:15:34] blessed things I just rejoice in it so
[2:15:37] much when I Minister and and while I'm
[2:15:40] preaching God just led me down a little
[2:15:42] Rabbit Trail here and down a rabbit
[2:15:43] Trail here and someone would come back
[2:15:45] afterwards and say brother when you said
[2:15:46] that it was a real blessing to me oh
[2:15:48] that wasn't even on my notes you see
[2:15:51] because the Holy Spirit uses those
[2:15:53] things God can use ministers I mean
[2:15:56] sometimes I think and I know this is you
[2:15:57] know this is this is going overboard but
[2:15:59] sometimes I think all God needs is a
[2:16:01] little framework and a minister to stand
[2:16:03] here so that he can come on the scene
[2:16:04] and he can address supernaturally the
[2:16:06] things that we
[2:16:08] need but if it's about us wanting to be
[2:16:10] seen we need to get back to the altar my
[2:16:13] brothers and sisters I mean only God can
[2:16:15] do that
[2:16:17] work so just a few things that that that
[2:16:20] I want to quickly run
[2:16:23] through sometimes we can have a very um
[2:16:27] Armenian type of frame of mind and and I
[2:16:30] know that I've spoken quite extensively
[2:16:32] about that in the past a kind of
[2:16:35] legalistic approach where we can so
[2:16:37] quickly put pressures on one another and
[2:16:39] criticize one another and judge one
[2:16:41] another and hurt one another and throw
[2:16:43] stones at one another amen when we don't
[2:16:46] match up or when the outside doesn't
[2:16:48] line up with with the word and so forth
[2:16:51] am mean but the other side of it is I
[2:16:55] mean God may be working with an
[2:16:56] individual God may be dealing with that
[2:16:59] individual and if there's any slightest
[2:17:02] inkling of an idea that you are better
[2:17:04] than that person that you are more
[2:17:06] spiritual than that person you have a
[2:17:07] major problem my brothers and sisters
[2:17:09] amen you are not better than anyone but
[2:17:12] for Christ Living on the inside I mean
[2:17:15] we are all I mean one of the things
[2:17:17] brother nesto ministered that was just
[2:17:19] so special for me was how he just showed
[2:17:21] we all start at base zero amen we all
[2:17:26] have come from that mixed race amen we
[2:17:29] all hybrid s the seed of the serpent was
[2:17:33] mixed into the whole human race amen we
[2:17:36] cannot claim that I am pure and you not
[2:17:39] we all start from nothing we all need
[2:17:42] the grace of God so
[2:17:45] much but our attitude often times
[2:17:48] doesn't reflect the attitude of Jesus
[2:17:50] Jus Christ he could say father forgive
[2:17:52] them they don't know what they're doing
[2:17:54] interceding on his behalf taking our
[2:17:57] roles as priests interceding saying Lord
[2:18:00] please open to my brother please open to
[2:18:02] my sister lord they're not seeing what
[2:18:04] your word expects them amen but please
[2:18:07] open to them am mean that's the kind of
[2:18:09] attitude sighing and crying on their
[2:18:11] behalf rather than throwing stones at
[2:18:13] them I me that's just going to kill
[2:18:15] them or we can have the calvinistic view
[2:18:19] where we just God doesn't care amen I am
[2:18:23] justified praise the Lord and now God
[2:18:25] doesn't care what I do that's
[2:18:27] nonsense that might have worked in
[2:18:29] Luther's day but it's not for us anymore
[2:18:32] my brothers and sisters amen I am
[2:18:34] justified only by the blood of
[2:18:37] Christ only by the blood of Christ I
[2:18:39] have nothing more that I can bring to
[2:18:41] him but if that inner teacher is living
[2:18:44] in your heart my brother and sister that
[2:18:46] inner teacher is going to teach you the
[2:18:47] ways of God that he going to think
[2:18:50] through through you the thinking of God
[2:18:52] he's going to live through you the word
[2:18:53] of God Amen the the the things that the
[2:18:56] Bible speaks about in terms of um uh uh
[2:19:01] how we should conduct ourselves and
[2:19:02] things I think that things that the
[2:19:04] prophet opened up in our day where he
[2:19:06] showed us this is how a man should dress
[2:19:08] this is how a woman should dress this is
[2:19:09] our contact conduct around one another
[2:19:12] all those things my brothers and sisters
[2:19:13] he meant it amen now we don't go around
[2:19:17] and whack people on the head with it but
[2:19:20] what we want to do is just like I said
[2:19:21] with the calvinistic side we want to ask
[2:19:24] God to bring it to pass we want those
[2:19:27] things to be L from the inside when the
[2:19:29] inside life is a lamb life it will bring
[2:19:32] forth wool
[2:19:34] amen and this Holy Ghost will not bring
[2:19:36] forth Crow feathers amen this holy ghost
[2:19:40] ghost will bring forth the life of Jesus
[2:19:43] Christ amen so our standard is still the
[2:19:46] word standard but if we're insecure what
[2:19:49] we do is we we start judging people
[2:19:51] around us we start throwing stones at
[2:19:53] them and all those kind of things or and
[2:19:55] and if we don't have that real genuine
[2:19:57] personal revelation of Jesus Christ we
[2:19:59] become lacked God doesn't mind about my
[2:20:01] clothing it's okay to put a bit of
[2:20:03] makeup on it's it's okay I mean I don't
[2:20:05] want to preach those things in someone
[2:20:07] else's ppit God knows amen but but the
[2:20:10] reality is brothers and sisters when
[2:20:12] you're in relationship with Christ he
[2:20:13] will guide you to full truth amen he
[2:20:16] will he will himself teach you I mean
[2:20:19] you know what a some of the most
[2:20:21] wonderful testimonies that I so rejoice
[2:20:23] in there was a sister I think it was a
[2:20:25] Chinese sister in one of the islands in
[2:20:28] the South Pacific I can't remember I
[2:20:29] think I can't remember if it was PNG or
[2:20:31] one of the islands where in the area
[2:20:34] where she lived there was no message
[2:20:36] Believers God led her to online find the
[2:20:39] message she started studying the message
[2:20:41] no contact with Believers whatsoever and
[2:20:44] a few years later she came in contact
[2:20:47] with Believers she started going to a
[2:20:48] church she found a church that was
[2:20:50] somewhere we where she could reach it
[2:20:52] and so forth and her life had lined up
[2:20:54] with the word so beautifully that her
[2:20:56] conduct was better than people that had
[2:20:58] been sitting in church now my brothers
[2:21:00] and sisters that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:21:02] will do that's not legalism that's not
[2:21:06] legalism when you do what the word says
[2:21:08] do from your heart not because brother
[2:21:10] so and so criticize me and sister so and
[2:21:12] so talks bad about me that's just human
[2:21:14] pressure nonsense I mean but the Holy
[2:21:17] Ghost in us will do the right thing
[2:21:21] so now I'm sorry I'm just going to make
[2:21:23] it pretty explicit okay to to to make
[2:21:25] the point we can sit in church now amen
[2:21:29] and brother Ben I'm going to make him
[2:21:30] the bad guy now praise the Lord so
[2:21:32] brother Ben is is preaching and he might
[2:21:35] be hammering amen am mean because he
[2:21:37] sees maybe there's something not right
[2:21:39] he might be hammering something and
[2:21:40] saying sisters we need to look at our
[2:21:42] clothing Brothers we need to look at our
[2:21:43] conduct and so forth amen and maybe God
[2:21:47] is saying something to
[2:21:49] you and you need to sit and listen and
[2:21:51] say God are you telling me something not
[2:21:54] oh I hope sister son so is
[2:21:57] listening but now you can't oh but at
[2:22:00] home I've got brother son so sedes that
[2:22:02] he says we shouldn't judge one another
[2:22:05] am mean my brothers and sisters what
[2:22:07] you're doing is you're working against
[2:22:09] God and that's the point what is God
[2:22:13] saying to you today amen or the other
[2:22:16] way around amen when when God is pre
[2:22:20] preaching ing mercy and Grace and and
[2:22:22] nonjudgmentalism and so forth amen and
[2:22:25] and and you think my goodness brother
[2:22:27] Ben is not upholding the standard I mean
[2:22:30] so let's get someone in here who's you
[2:22:32] know my brothers and sisters you might
[2:22:34] be missing what God is telling you and
[2:22:36] often when we have this kind of leaning
[2:22:38] amen our natural tendency is we go and
[2:22:42] Heap ourselves
[2:22:43] teachers because we have itching ears
[2:22:46] because we want to do what we want to do
[2:22:48] and we don't want anyone to tell us one
[2:22:50] to do
[2:22:51] pigheaded human pride and actually what
[2:22:54] we do is we bind the hands of the Holy
[2:22:56] Spirit to actually do something for us
[2:22:58] because we lend our ears only to those
[2:23:00] which we
[2:23:03] want amen there's things around Faith
[2:23:05] and
[2:23:06] Healing amen it's one of my favorite
[2:23:09] things to speak about brother Bram
[2:23:11] speaks about how he every time his
[2:23:13] children got sick he took them to the
[2:23:15] doctor brother Brandon amen I read a
[2:23:19] quot to the church the other day where
[2:23:21] he speaks about how a specific sister in
[2:23:24] in in that that he had um helped in a
[2:23:27] private interview he said I went through
[2:23:30] their life sorry I don't have the quote
[2:23:32] with me he says I went through their
[2:23:33] life and I searched where the issue was
[2:23:35] because their daughter was sick and he
[2:23:38] says the only thing I could found could
[2:23:40] find was they believed that it was
[2:23:43] unspiritual I put it in my own words I
[2:23:45] can't remember exactly how the prophet
[2:23:46] put it to take medication and I dealt
[2:23:49] with that and I said to a sister that's
[2:23:51] nonsense and the kid took her medication
[2:23:53] and she got better now how spiritual is
[2:23:56] that we have a prophet here that could
[2:23:58] just lay hands on her and she could be
[2:24:00] better that's Religious brothers and
[2:24:03] sisters that's a religious spirit spirit
[2:24:05] amen but the flip side to that is if God
[2:24:09] reveals to you personally not sister so
[2:24:12] and so saying it's bad to take medicine
[2:24:14] because you're not so spiritual as her
[2:24:16] or brother so and so that's just all the
[2:24:18] human garbage that's all human voices
[2:24:21] because of their own insecurities and
[2:24:22] they're not where they should be with
[2:24:24] God or whatever reasons and it can come
[2:24:26] through like I said a very beautiful
[2:24:28] close friend that's also in the
[2:24:30] message go what God shows you amen when
[2:24:35] God has shown you if you've got cancer
[2:24:37] and God has shown you you are healed you
[2:24:39] Chuck all your medication in the rubbish
[2:24:40] B amen but God needs to tell
[2:24:44] you amen not because someone else wants
[2:24:47] you to be religious to feed their own
[2:24:49] little religious family or whatever amen
[2:24:52] God needs to tell you that's what I love
[2:24:54] about this message there's a balance
[2:24:56] Amen brother Brandon makes statements he
[2:24:58] says if we believed enough God may even
[2:25:01] give us a cure for what was it cancer or
[2:25:03] something hang on why can't God just
[2:25:05] heal the people he speaks about how we
[2:25:08] should be praying for the medical
[2:25:10] profession and then on the other hand
[2:25:12] he's speaking about how we don't need
[2:25:14] those people if God comes on the scene
[2:25:16] there's a balance my brothers and
[2:25:18] sisters and every case is
[2:25:21] unique amen and today it might be that
[2:25:23] God wants you to go to the doctor and
[2:25:25] take the medicine and tomorrow it might
[2:25:27] be that God wants to show you Faith amen
[2:25:30] and it's not your choosing sorry but
[2:25:33] it's not amen God chooses because he's
[2:25:36] he's got the right to do that yes amen
[2:25:44] hallelujah I think I've covered quite
[2:25:46] extensively
[2:25:48] Doctrine just the intellectual
[2:25:50] understanding I mean we could put
[2:25:52] pressure on other people if you don't
[2:25:54] understand this or if you don't listen
[2:25:56] to brother so and so or if or if you're
[2:25:58] not able to cope with you know 3 hours
[2:26:00] of service or whatever stuff there's so
[2:26:03] much nonsense that people put pressure
[2:26:05] on one another for am mean there's so
[2:26:08] much pressure where people can just you
[2:26:10] know want to compete how much I know
[2:26:13] let's check you know kind of I mean we
[2:26:15] don't do it openly but in reality I know
[2:26:17] I've been there for so many years oh the
[2:26:20] are speaking let's see how much I can
[2:26:21] show them how much I know come on you're
[2:26:24] insecure you're not mature amen let's
[2:26:28] just be real like I said in the
[2:26:30] beginning for me this message is just
[2:26:32] becoming simpler and simpler and simpler
[2:26:35] but speak to a denominational person for
[2:26:37] 5 minutes and you will see how much God
[2:26:40] has made known to you the message is
[2:26:42] only simple because God has revealed it
[2:26:44] to you because we don't have to do this
[2:26:47] Out Of Reach stuff that we can't
[2:26:49] understand God makes it the Bible says
[2:26:52] he makes it known to his beloved in his
[2:26:54] sleep amen God gives it to us
[2:26:57] freely but while we're trying
[2:26:59] to compete for the next person I mean
[2:27:02] we're breaking our faith down come on
[2:27:05] let's be real we serving a reality God
[2:27:09] Amen we may have like I said I spoke to
[2:27:12] AB about Absalom earlier we might have
[2:27:15] opinions of how to run the church and we
[2:27:17] might have opinions about how to run the
[2:27:18] music and we might have opinions about
[2:27:20] how sister so and so should be raising
[2:27:23] her kids and how brother so and so
[2:27:24] should be conducting his marriage and
[2:27:26] all that stuff my brothers and
[2:27:29] sisters is actually a waste of time if
[2:27:32] the Holy Spirit doesn't help that
[2:27:35] person but what we can do and what we
[2:27:37] should be doing is spend time on our
[2:27:40] knees we need to focus Less on Theology
[2:27:43] and much more on neology Amen praying
[2:27:47] for our brothers and sisters praying
[2:27:49] that God Amen if you don't agree with
[2:27:51] how the music is happening in the church
[2:27:53] and I I'm picking something that I know
[2:27:54] won't be a problem but if you don't
[2:27:56] agree with how it's done go on your
[2:27:58] knees and ask God God either change me
[2:28:01] or change the music amen then God will
[2:28:05] will make it happen you know I'm just I
[2:28:07] know God is blessing you with with with
[2:28:09] all these music and and things and and
[2:28:12] God is giving you songs and and music
[2:28:14] music and things and it's wonderful I I
[2:28:16] praise God for that but be careful that
[2:28:19] that doesn't become a new new pressure I
[2:28:21] mean you're only spiritual if you've
[2:28:22] written a song or you only you know it
[2:28:25] can SE human stuff I mean Satan just
[2:28:28] jumps in on everything and wants to make
[2:28:30] it a pressure I mean it's Sovereign it's
[2:28:34] God giving it am mean if it's in any
[2:28:36] other way it's glorifying you and not
[2:28:39] God make sure that God gets the
[2:28:43] glory I said this earlier but our
[2:28:46] attitude can can often be reflected this
[2:28:49] way
[2:28:51] why beholdest thou the moat that's in
[2:28:52] thy brother's eye but considerest not
[2:28:54] the beam that's in thine own eye we know
[2:28:57] that we are so good at that as human
[2:29:01] beings in 2 Timothy 4 the scripture says
[2:29:05] for the time will come when they will
[2:29:07] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[2:29:09] their own lust shall they Heap up to he
[2:29:12] Heap to themselves teachers having
[2:29:14] itching ears they shall turn away their
[2:29:16] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[2:29:17] unto fables and those teachers don't
[2:29:20] have to be ministers behind the pulpit
[2:29:23] that teacher can be your brother your
[2:29:25] sister your friend your phone buddy your
[2:29:30] whatever we can so easily search until
[2:29:33] marriage and divorce is a is a wonderful
[2:29:36] example one that I've seen in the past
[2:29:38] couple wants to get married to go to
[2:29:40] their Pastor he says no the way I look
[2:29:42] at the word you can't get married no
[2:29:45] problem we'll search a pastor that will
[2:29:46] marry us it's exactly what people do
[2:29:49] with so many other things we look around
[2:29:52] until we find someone that agrees with
[2:29:54] us instead of going to God God am I
[2:29:57] wrong please change me if I'm wrong I
[2:30:00] want to have your perfect
[2:30:02] will amen I'm really winding down I
[2:30:05] won't be long I
[2:30:06] promise I mean I just want to speak
[2:30:08] about us being bullboards for a moment
[2:30:11] and ask you what bullboard are you are
[2:30:15] you reflecting your understanding your
[2:30:18] goodness your know
[2:30:21] knowledge or are you only reflecting The
[2:30:23] Life of
[2:30:25] Christ are you pushing your unbalanced
[2:30:29] perspectives or are you willing to die
[2:30:31] out to yourself and let only him speak
[2:30:33] through
[2:30:34] you what are you
[2:30:38] selling are you selling a Pentecostal
[2:30:40] idea of riches and
[2:30:43] wealth or of uncontrolled gifts with no
[2:30:47] discernment necessary
[2:30:50] are we selling a Lutheran Doctrine or a
[2:30:52] wsan Doctrine where
[2:30:55] it's our human
[2:30:57] works or where it's just K God wouldn't
[2:31:01] care God doesn't care God doesn't
[2:31:05] judge how easily are we upset by the
[2:31:09] liberalist amen I've seen it brothers
[2:31:11] and sisters I've seen it so many times a
[2:31:14] visiting Minister will come and he will
[2:31:16] deal with things and and he will be
[2:31:17] preaching a little bit of of clothline
[2:31:19] preaching or something and then suddenly
[2:31:22] everyone wants to be you know legalists
[2:31:25] and then the next Minister comes and he
[2:31:26] preaches Grace and everyone is don't
[2:31:28] worry God is come on let's mature amen
[2:31:33] amen because sometimes God is dealing
[2:31:35] with one person in the church amen and
[2:31:39] the rest of us that specific service is
[2:31:42] not intended for amen but now everyone
[2:31:45] else gets nervous people that generally
[2:31:48] tend to legalism I mean here comes a
[2:31:50] minister past that that that preaches
[2:31:52] the legalistic kind of perspective maybe
[2:31:54] and and when I say legalistic I mean
[2:31:56] just you know focus on the dos and don't
[2:31:58] sub it because it's part of the word I
[2:31:59] mean we don't throw those things away
[2:32:01] amen and then all the people that tend
[2:32:03] to to lean towards legalism all get
[2:32:05] nervous God am I right with you am I
[2:32:08] doing all the right stuff am I amen
[2:32:10] instead God's trying to deal with
[2:32:12] someone that's leaning over to the
[2:32:14] liberal side and the other way too I
[2:32:17] mean if you are finding yourself to be
[2:32:20] too liberal with the word pull up your
[2:32:22] socks get yourself ready time is up I
[2:32:25] mean we can't muck around but when I
[2:32:27] preach that to someone that is leaning
[2:32:29] towards liberalism sorry towards
[2:32:31] legalism makes them all fearful we're
[2:32:34] not supposed to be ruled by fear perfect
[2:32:37] love casts out all fear we have nothing
[2:32:40] to be afraid about God has overcome
[2:32:42] 2,000 years ago and we are the
[2:32:44] recipients of the Redemption plan I mean
[2:32:47] there's nothing that can keep you out of
[2:32:49] hell my brother brother and sister all
[2:32:51] the devils in hell can't keep you out of
[2:32:53] hell sorry can't can't keep you out of
[2:32:55] Heaven amen sorry the other way around
[2:32:57] amen nothing that anyone can do my
[2:33:00] brothers and sisters can keep you out of
[2:33:02] Eternity Hallelujah if you're a
[2:33:04] predestinated son and daughter of god so
[2:33:07] let's just submit to him
[2:33:10] amen so are we confident in what we do
[2:33:14] we're driven by fear driven by other
[2:33:16] people's fear driven by what other
[2:33:20] people say how other people
[2:33:22] criticize are we displaying only the
[2:33:24] doctrine the letter or we also
[2:33:26] displaying the spirit of the word amen
[2:33:29] are we representing ourselves or are we
[2:33:31] representing Jesus
[2:33:33] Christ
[2:33:36] amen do we speak our theories as if it
[2:33:40] was the word you push your views of
[2:33:43] things on
[2:33:45] others or do you actually reflect only
[2:33:48] the word
[2:33:50] when you have your own idea do you say
[2:33:53] like brother Marcus Beaker always says
[2:33:56] say now this is Marcus okay okay
[2:33:58] Hallelujah okay okay he says this is
[2:34:00] Marcus what he's say saying through that
[2:34:02] is this is my understanding this is not
[2:34:05] the word but this is how I see it amen
[2:34:07] if we can humble oursel like that not
[2:34:10] just preach it as if it is the word and
[2:34:11] tomorrow we say something else because
[2:34:13] God has shown us more that confuses
[2:34:15] people especially our children amen
[2:34:19] let's just be
[2:34:21] normal Hallelujah are we Billboards for
[2:34:24] the latest fashions the latest name
[2:34:26] brands do we want to show forth our
[2:34:29] financial
[2:34:30] success are we caught up in the Chas to
[2:34:33] keep up with the
[2:34:34] Joneses or do we show forth a testimony
[2:34:37] of the reality of Jesus Christ it might
[2:34:39] not be a Bed of Roses on this side but
[2:34:42] we have all our amen gold and silver on
[2:34:46] the other side amen keeping it there
[2:34:48] with moth and rust cannot cannot uh take
[2:34:52] away from it amen so we can ask the
[2:34:56] question how on Earth do we do that how
[2:34:59] on Earth do we get that right I can't be
[2:35:01] my own judge I can't from my own human
[2:35:04] Spirit judge my own human spirit amen
[2:35:06] and you're absolutely right you can't I
[2:35:08] can't but what we can do is like I said
[2:35:11] go on your knees to
[2:35:13] God ask him to help you die out to
[2:35:17] ourselves and be sensitive to his still
[2:35:19] Small Voice amen so that he can help us
[2:35:22] to be willing to follow that inside
[2:35:26] teacher and follow out the
[2:35:29] offering amen I'm just going to close
[2:35:31] there I'm sorry for taking a little
[2:35:32] longer than I intended to but I trust
[2:35:34] that the Lord did something that would
[2:35:37] be a blessing to you let's just stand
