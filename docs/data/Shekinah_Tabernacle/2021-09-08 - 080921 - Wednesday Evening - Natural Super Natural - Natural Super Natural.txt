good to breathe amen christians love being alive you know because we've got life in us and life loves being alive i thank the lord that we can um be here tonight what a strange time life is full of strange situations you know it takes many different twists and turns and it and it has many changes along the way but we serve an unchanging god that regardless of these unusual times we go through god is still the same amen and i'm glad that that he is you know in this world they we worry about this virus that's going around but you know the real virus is sin that's gone around and and is taking is killing men and women eternally that's the real virus that's that's the one that's the one that we are coming to defeat tonight is that virus of sin and i'm glad that we've been given the vaccination of the holy ghost to we we can't be infected by these these demons the demons of sin we've got the holy ghost amen amen praise the lord so that's that's what we're after tonight so let's um can you bring up that first one brother and we'll just read this the scripture i'm going to read is from first first corinthians 14 23 to 25 if you have your bibles amen i'm glad to be at church this evening amen if therefore the whole church become together into one place and all speak with tongues and they come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but a full prophesy and there coming one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth amen you can take your seats this evening and the thought that i have on my heart this evening it's it's a very very simple thought and it's i'm calling it a natural supernatural a very natural supernatural because all of us here are supernatural people [Music] we're we are not natural people by any stretch of the imagination we are a very supernatural people and that's just normal for us it's not unusual or hard or anything like that we're actually a supernatural people we're not we are not natural so that's my if that's my message of exhortation to you this evening it's that regardless of what you might think in your mind you are you are you all are very supernatural people and you're you're you've got this thing called faith that is very powerful and it works outside of all that you can see and you are very powerful supernatural people and take that really take that on board because that's that's the truth this is not just something we make up and we kind of feel good about ourselves when we talk about it this is a reality that we live is supernatural so that's going to be my theme tonight is it's just supernatural i'm just going to talk about it in a relaxed way because it sometimes we get too worried about things and we we make things up too high that we don't think we can quite attain to them but it's not really that hard it's all very very quite simple just relax and it just all happens it's very quite normal that's the time that we're living in you know we look around us and we don't know what to make of the situation that we see around us you know there are all these different trains of thought and time will tell what this whole situation is right we don't know time will tell what it is maybe just a passing fed maybe this maybe that all i know is this we're at the basically at the last chapter of of of humanity something's going to happen we're in the closing chapter and i'm glad that the the important for us is that we are going from natural to supernatural from earthly to heavenly from mortal to immortality that's the journey we're on so regardless of all the stuff you know that we we doing all this sort of carry on don't worry about it don't worry a thing about it our journey is from natural to supernatural that's the that's the path that we're on you know and and it's not going to be a surprise that we end up further and further down that path that we we we are eventually going to be so far down that we just our bodies just change one day we just this earth can't hold us anymore it just it gives up i give up i can't hold you no more this immortality this mortality shall put on immortality so so don't worry about all the stuff you see around you that's the don't worry about that program our program we know what our program is it's that we're on a we're on this journey from we're on a journey out of here that's uh it's our program so i'm gonna just say a few stories about something that that intrigues me and it should intrigue you too when you think about the situations like this i got this picture here and i'm gonna just you'll know what the story is when i tell you it was it was brother brandon when he prayed for the boys in finland so he's he's in finland and then they're driving around with some brothers on a missionary trip and they they drive down a hill and and then they see there's been a terrible accident and a couple of boys had been run over by a i think it was a some sort of ford motor car 1935 ford had spun around and it is these i think the story goes that these boys were used to horses and buggies and that and they weren't used to these cars going so fast down the road that they it caught them by surprise and then this guy had one of them and hit the other boy so and that this isn't the picture but just to put it into our reality if you sometimes hear these things on tape and you think wow it seems so far away but it was just would have just looked like something like this as a car accident you know after marvel that elijah the prophet drove in a motor car you know and and went to mcdonald's if they had mcdonald's back then and you know he did all the he didn't just walk around in a in a sheepskin and eat locust elijah came here and did the things that we do heard music when he went into the mall saw everything he was here and he turned up here and saw this here and and the the brothers there were quite taken back by the situation and the brothers that were with brother branham because they had sons as well and they were overcome with emotion about it and brother branham looked over there and and he was just wondering what to do and you know thinking sad what if that was my boy and those sorts of things and i'll just pick it up here he says and as i started to turn around i looked in front of the little boy i felt something go i said maybe that's just my sympathy for the little fellow i started to make it another step and something went i waited just a moment i turned around i said let me see that boy again and they pulled back the the coat that they had laying over him because he was laying there dead and he said i've seen that boy somewhere i said ask those ministers if he's been in the church if he's a member of their church any of you guys know this boy he looks familiar to me maybe he's been through the prayer line or something they said no he said has he ever been in the prayer line brother lindsay said no he said i no he said i've seen him somewhere but i don't know where i don't know where i've seen this little boy before then he looked around and he saw a bunch of rocks i looked around and i saw them big rocks piled up laying there i said praise god i know where i saw him i said brother moore get your bible brother lindsay said what's the matter brother branham i said look at the folder the leaf in your bible so who's got an actual bible here so imagine if you were with them and and 10 years ago you were brother brown's friend 10 years ago had said to you whoever many years it was write down that i'm going to see the boy he's going to be raised back to life there's going to be rocks around all these certain things you've you've written it down thinking this is interesting i wonder what's going to happen here so imagine you then you open your bible and you read the fly leaf and he said that's the that's the little boy that's going to be raised be raised from the dead brother moore ran over to the car and got his bible and he opened it up and it said brown hair brown eyes about eight years old poorly dressed crippled being mashed by an accident a rocky land i said brother branham that's it i said that's him amen now now this situation ought to really intrigue us beyond belief but i say not beyond belief because we believe but this is an outstanding situation when you stop and think about the magnitude of what just happened here how on earth could someone know the future how on earth when you start to compre try and comprehend that understanding then you ask yourself then what of all this how did how did somebody know that situation there has it already happened or is someone just going to orchestrate it so it happens what is going on here think deeply about this this has got to be the most intriguing thing because we would say well we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but what's going on here then then where is tomorrow where is it all where does it exist what are we in something happened here where somebody said i'm going to see this sometime in the future and if if this is all true then this something very very very big is going on here massive like it should throw our world into chaos wow there is something more to all this than than than what i can see how on earth could somebody possibly know the future when you think about that what is the future then what what are we in is this a movie is it a movie are we just playing it out how does all this work think about it this is this is massive like and even david and i don't think i've gone on for that long enough but what is what are we in friends what is this all this is not a natural according to this situation here this is not natural this is not an this is not natural there's something outstanding in existence here because somebody knows the future how can how can i fathom that lord in my mind how can somebody know the future when we have never been there yet and where does this whole thing exist then where is it all what what of all this that we're in we're a supernatural people we're living in a supernatural space we're not this is not natural then this is this is not just oh we don't know the future are you sure it's not what we think it is this is this is outstanding absolutely outstanding and david when he wrote in the psalms he said oh lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting am i not rising they understand this my thoughts are far off before they get to me you know what they are how is that possible that's outstanding now compass is my path am i lying down and i'd acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh lord thou knowest it all together before a word comes in my tongue you know what i'm going to speak thou has to set me behind and before and lay down hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me that is too high i cannot attain unto it and you stop thinking this is too much for me to think about when you think about that notion of time though that somebody knows the future there then what exactly is this thing that we're in what is all this now if i give you see the mouth of two or three witnesses in a court if you bring forth a whole lot of witnesses then you have to acknowledge okay something's going on here if they all collaborate you know say the same thing these things should be out these are outstanding events that we should just go wow there is we are very supernatural friends but there's not a natural occurrence we are not if you think if we thought we were natural think again we're involved in this sort of stuff this is not natural we're very very supernatural we're all very spiritual people that's that's who we are don't let satan lie to you and say you're natural you're not no way friends you're very supernatural that's that's actually who we are and the more i'm living my life and just walking with the lord the more it's just becoming very very normal wow i'm just a supernatural person and i don't think normally you know half of my decisions are based on a feeling and it's not rational i don't weigh it up it's a feeling i just feel that to do that you say oh you shouldn't go on feelings well of course we have our thought you know is it right or wrong with that sort of stuff you know but i'm talking about whether you should do something or not like i go on how i feel why because i've got the holy ghost in me if it just feels natural i don't feel any sort of turmoil about the decision okay then we're all relaxed about it we can just carry on i just feel alright about it i know for a fact when something is wrong i feel like i just feel funny about it i don't why because there's something something in me is just saying don't go just don't go that way don't do that so don't do it i'm like i don't know why it seems like such a great thing it's everything's in line but i just don't want to do it why because i'm supernatural not just natural i don't just wad up naturally yes that ticks all the boxes then i go and do it that's not how we operate we don't do things like that we know someone that knows the future and he just knows that's not the right way so we just and it's not like a hard thing i'm not we don't have to be overly spiritual to do that we just have to be a christian because that's what that's our that's how we operate we we we just that's how our life is it's not we don't we're not governed by natural things we're governed by spiritual things that that's that's who we are so this one here these brothers are camping with brother brenham you guys will know the story i just like the picture on your left i just think it's amazing that a man's profile can be carved into a rock or that the word eagle could be written in a rock when was that written there how did those courts did they did god just write it in the order the courts just after the some volcanic activity did it just all sort of turn a certain way and did it form naturally or spiritually like the ten commandments the bible says god just wrote in the rock with his finger but was that did he right in the rock eagle with the quartz or did he did they just flow a certain way and then when the rock snapped off you know did it it broke in the right place why because we're all supernatural people this stuff just happens and they were camping these and then the whirlwind came in brother branham dived away and you know the story and he said and then he said to the brothers there judgment's going to strike the west coast so here's these here here are these christians and the prophet of god out in the camping something happens and then he says at some time in the future judgment is going to strike the west coast and he i think he throw a rock yeah now that was a supernatural event not normal like you'd think normal people natural people would say you guys are strange i think i'm done with this camping trip i'm out supernatural people think judgment is going to strike the west coast okay and then what happened yeah there was a massive earthquake and alaska tsunamis and that and judgment struck the west coast that's what happened that that that's an unusual situation how did he know yeah it was he a size what do they call a seismologist was he reading the graph so like you know the people try and predict earthquakes and they no one actually knows they say oh according to them it hasn't been one for 200 years so we're about two for one here and then what happens way over there they're like oh yeah well that one was kind of due nobody knows they're getting it right more and more and more though you know why because the bible says that these things would increase in the last days so they're like i told you there was going to be one well yeah no we told you because somehow or another the history it's already happened history has already been the future has already been for some i don't know how it works but it's already been it's already happened work that one out i can't work it out but somehow or another it's happened this one was another one this is slightly different but it's this this is this was i think it was the meeting in mexico where the ladies baby had died at nine o'clock in the morning and you can just picture this crowd i just wanted to give you the picture because you can imagine where in the back of the crowd somewhere there's a lady with a baby yeah wrestling through the crowd you know and you can you could see maybe this commotion weaving its way through the crowd and all the brothers are trying to stop this woman from getting up to the front you know and all the deacons are down there you know and then they're going up to brother adam and saying and there's this lady just she's really trying to get up here and we're trying to stop her and we we just can't manage to stop her and then you know there and brother branham because he's just naturally doing this thing he said oh just brother moore she doesn't really know me she doesn't know who we are you just go down there and she'll think you're me and just pray for her and you know like it probably happens all the time just because she wasn't in the prayer line he was managing the prayer line you know he he just doing what he always doesn't know you just go and quickly deal with it just pray for her and then he then brother brown saw a vision he saw sometime in the future a baby alive that's outstanding and this is a and then then he said hang on wait a minute bring the baby up to me then he prayed for the baby and this dead baby came back to life it was very supernatural this is not normal how many dead people just babies just come back to life generally speaking a baby dies you sign the death certificate which i think the doctor did sign the death certificate and then you notify the family the extended family you have the funeral and that's naturally what we do but in this occasion the baby came back to life and but before that there was a vision shown in the future this baby will be alive who knew who knew that like who knew with in the future that would be like that this this is mind-boggling now this is the last one i've got of this little sequence i don't know why i put this but i just found this interesting brother branham said i see a hood of death over that lady she's gonna die so someone took a photo and this was back before photoshop and there was a hood over the lady that's supernatural like this is quite normal this is actually normal stuff this is this is us this is what we deal in we deal in supernatural we're not natural so now this scripture here says and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with him and confirming the word with signs following you know why they did that because they were supernatural people just like us you know that's just what they did it was just a normal thing it's it's not a hard thing you know we we sometimes think the supernatural is a hard thing it's not a hard thing just relax just this is what we deal in this is how we operate we we don't we don't live see the problem the problem in this society the biggest problem that we have is scientific knowledge and an understanding of logic now brother branham was never against being um increasing your intellect to understand something when he when he spoke against education it was never that he didn't he liked educated people that would that could study about a certain subject and become enriched by it and also enrich other people's lives through their knowledge of that subject he was against logic putting limits and making spiritual people into natural people because that's what education can do if you study it let's say you study to be a doctor you're educated but this is what you will come out with say i have this injury or you tell this person you have this into your condition and it will only get fixed naturally to a certain point then after that nothing can be done in a let's say you've got one leg and the other your other leg's gone you know we can make your prosthetic leg or do something but your leg will technically never grow back it's not possible for the cells to join and everything and to create another leg if you had a little scratch maybe that will grow you that could be healed but your leg could never be healed or you may have a some sort of mental condition or some other condition you know this is the truth and they tell you this you cannot be healed past a certain point like because it's scientific it's a fact now you understand this that we've got to get away from this because it's not a fact you see it's not actually a fact but this is what brother brown was against in this society we get taught so much logic that we now take this as fact like and it it hinders us from we we then the satan tries to make us natural people he tries to make us natural we don't think like this we don't think like this like what would we say we say i've got this injury but i but i can just be healed completely of it no problem at all there's no it's no problem it's not a big deal see we've got to we're because we're a supernatural people you believe that that's that this is who we are we're not natural we don't we don't believe this we don't we don't we're not natural now if we were supernatural how would we think oh this i tell you why i think this this that's not me and my three two wayward brothers and our friend she's actually got one leg that girl always had one leg uh still friends with her actually today um this is me back when i was not doing what i should be doing but the reason why i gave you this is because in this situation here something happened to me when i was like look like this you know god god's big bigger than all this that we that we see i shouldn't say this but my brother won't mind me saying he was a he was a bad influence on me my older brother he's a good guy now he was i never wanted to do dumb things but he always was and he wouldn't drag me into it i was never into it he just i never said let's go and do this he always would do the dumb stuff and drag me in so after a while i said not doing it but anyway he got me into smoking different things and i tell you this for a story because i you wonder you think you wonder why i think this is not a natural occurrence i've had things happen to me where i think okay this is definitely not natural you can't you couldn't tell me that i'm i'm that there's nothing else here so we got okay we so he got all this marijuana and he was smoking it all day and i was about 14 or 15 whenever i was 16 he was giving it to me all day and then by the evening he said i'll do one more and i was done and he was like let's do one more like oh okay and then we went to bed and and it was strange because inside my body it felt like it was shaking my arm was still but inside was shaking funny you know i would sit down it would go inside me it's the strangest thing any sort of drug never worked for me i just never the lord kept me from a lot of stuff because i'd never enjoyed any of it ever and it would shake him and i was laying in bed not knowing what to do and then so i woke up my brother i said man i'm like and so my body's shaking it's going all funny and we tried all sorts of different things i tried running on the spot you know to try and get out of it and then that didn't work we tried all sorts of other things in the room we used to live outside in this little batch outside behind the house so it's about midnight to 11 o'clock and i was like maybe try hosing me down with some water so so he's got this hose you know and he's outside hosing me down with this water to try and snap me out of the this thing that i was in worked for about 30 seconds and then i just got cold and shaking so i was shaking on the outside and the inside after that and and nothing worked you know and we went back around to outside of the little batch outside then i said to my brother bro let's pray and i put my arms around him looking like this you know he probably looked like that i put my arms around him and i may have told this before but this was the strangest thing i started praying for a friend that we used to hang out with you know pray for chris fowle and i felt this love in my heart for this guy chris it's the strangest thing thought but i just really love this guy lord just help my friend chris i think i prayed for two people then him not even thinking about the the shaking situation right and then and then in an instant something went from our head to our feet and went like that and we were completely sober both of us come completely straight like and we you can imagine we're sort of arms around each other and then because i i put my arms around him when i was praying and then when it happened we went and we both looked at each other and he said i said are you straight he said are and and we were instantaneously right you can't tell me this is a natural world that we live in because i go through those situations and i think okay say whatever you want to say tell me that they tell me all these impossibilities i experience that you can't convince me of it i didn't hear a story from somebody i i went something my whole brain this all of these chemicals got taken out of my body in an instant they just went gone and i was completely sober you there is more to life than that we're supernatural people we're not just we're not natural like this sort of stuff no human knows what will happen tomorrow who's told you that before that's not true amen that's not true whoever told you this is telling you a lie many see christians know what's going to happen tomorrow we we know what's we can easily be told what's happened tomorrow and we think of it as like a big god can pull out tomorrow like he can yesterday it's all just laying there it's not like oh you want to know tomorrow oh it's gonna be quite hard it's all land there just like see we can pick out the past very easily the future is no harder than the past it's all laying there it's just this blockage we have that oh no we don't know you know think about it it's it's all laying there it's not like it's hard to get it's like not like god's only got access to i or you've got two more not to make a light of it but you know like it has to all just be laying there it's all just laying there it's that the future in the past are all just as easy to access to god now to a supernatural being why not to us that's that's what that's that's the sort of people that we are we it's not this thing that we can't attain to it's only because we get told no one knows actually i can be told when's the next lockdown i could just ask god guys there's going to be a lockdown on the 28th of october so if you're planning on doing anything i'll probably borrow your stuff first if you want to do jobs at home because we're being locked down on 28th you know get to the shops by it all because you'll be you're going to be down for a month right and then locked in happens on the 28th well no that's how we operate we don't have to that's super that's that's normal for us you know that's why i read you the scripture at the start you know someone we can say we've got all these things which is nice but you know we're a supernatural people people get affected by the supernatural like that thing that happened to me it affected me you could tell me uh you could tell me a lot of things but just have that one occurrence happen to me and i'm convinced there's something else out there that's bigger than me you know that's why they said if you have an unbeliever come to a church and you're all speaking in tongues and he's going to think these guys are quite strange i don't know what's going on here and i don't believe i'll come back but you have someone prophesied of that person and say yeah you're so-and-so and you come from here and maybe and you you you in your car you've got this sitting in your car he knows no you've got this sitting in your glove box and you just bought it from the shop this morning you put in your glove box that man is going to say okay something's going on here he's going to go to work the next thing say guys you might think i'm strange and i usually never talk about this but i went to the church yesterday and they told me all the stuff that they knew nothing of this is strange he's not going to be ashamed like where'd you guys say oh just you know he's going to be like look say what you want that was you know you use this world to tell that was out there man whatever but it's going to affect him and he's going to say god's there something's going on there there's some there's something lurking in their midst as soon as they're looking but there's something in their midst that's that's just beyond all this they're not just a bunch of people walking around and singing a few songs somebody else is there that i didn't see but they told me stuff and they told me the secrets of my heart and it says they will bow down and worship god and think god is here that's what we have that's us that's what people will encounter when they come here because we are a supernatural people we can tell them hey just be careful this week on wednesday when you go to that job you're going to see this person here that accents them just be careful oh really wednesday that week there's an accident that happens well lucky i was standing back because i was on the lookout how did they know well that's actually what we do this is god we're a supernatural people we we don't believe this you understand we're not this is not true just like a leg can't grow back that's not actually true don't believe that that's not true we know it can happen tomorrow and and we can know somebody's passed way way that down that they know nothing of we can tell them what it is that's the god that that's that's and that's not just limited to a few people paul said covet to prophesy i would that you all would prophesy that all of you will prophesy i would that you all would not just a few of you that you all would and i'll read that scripture shortly you can't see that that's a possum on a road it's night time i'll tell you another story this is i just want to tell you a few of these you so i'm driving from tauranga to gisborne it's late at night eleven or twelve o'clock and i'm heading into the gorge i don't know if you know gizmo you gotta go into this deep dark gorge you know and then you get out the other side and you're in gizmo and you're there for another three years before you leave again because no one wants to go through the gorge or the other way is another gorge so you never when you come out the other way from the from gizmo on the other side when you go out to the gorge and into um opportunity you kind of get out to the open you're like wow the world you know the feeling wow it exists you know but so i'm driving back and i'm starting to feel real funny i'm like i'm just i'm feeling strange something in me is swirling up i'm thinking maybe it's because i'm tired but i'm thinking now i'm feeling really funny about something and then something starts saying okay there's going to be someone on the side of the road you've got to stop and when you see them on the side of the road you've got to stop this is about 12 30 1 o'clock midnight and you know we've got the my wife's in the car and little children in that and it's kind of raining and i'm thinking to myself if i see anyone i'm not stopping like i'm just carrying on man i'm going to stop and then i'm just thinking and then i'm driving along and i think okay lord i just feel strange about this if this is you then round one of these corners have a possum come on the road because and if you know possums when it's raining they don't really go out they stay in the trees you know so went around the corner and there was a possum on the road to quickly swerve to not get it i think i may have told this before but i just want to let you know this because we're we're not natural people this was so i drive a bit further and then i see uh hazard lights on the right in this car park area somebody says stop stop i'm like man i'm not stopping no no this is it's late i'm probably just thinking that the possum may have been a fluke i'm just going to carry on right so i'll carry on i'll carry on and then and then we get to work the next morning and i and we i go oh we um just you guys that this young christian guy started working for us i'm like oh here's so-and-so where is he's not at work this morning because it was a sunday right and this is a monday morning and my other mate was like oh no he um he was driving back from tauranga late last night and they broke down in the gorge and he was on the side of the road so they had to stay the night there it was him like oh really the person the lord said stop i'm not gonna jump come in the car drive you back to gizzy but i carried on but you go through those situations you think okay there's something more to this than what we can see this is not this is not normal you know we're not a normal people this is another one i had this trailer in this concrete mixer once and it was late at night and i really needed some money gizzy as well and i was like right i'm going to advertise both of them i've advertised them on the local buy sale exchange and then somebody said to me sell the concrete don't sell the trailer strange but and then it was about 11 o'clock at night and someone texts me about the trailer or rung me or who rung me i think he rings at 11 o'clock at night i didn't think nothing of it oh yeah yeah okay and i arranged to meet this guy that run me 11 o'clock at night with the trailer the next day but all along i think you don't sell the trailer then then i was even when i was getting the trailer on in the morning i pulled around and smashed the light on i was like oh man i probably shouldn't be selling this trailer anyway and and i went drove all the way to town to meet this guy no one turned up at the location i'm like this is a waste of time the guy wasn't even there so i drove back it turned out i actually bought a stolen trailer and because it was all painted right and then i actually just think about now i actually got it back to the right for loner later on so the lord had me give it back to him but then i was like okay that and then the next day i put a silly price on this concrete mixer and then these guys just turned up out of the blue i kind of come get the mixer they run on a saturday morning this is i think a few days later they didn't even look at it they're like oh here's the cash where's the mixer you know and they took it away i'm like okay because god says sell the mixer keep the trailer like that's how we operate that's quite normal you know these are this is how we do things we we we don't weigh it up all this is worth this much trailers worth that much if i probably sell this and that maybe that could use that you know we don't do it like that we just we're supernatural we just get told what to do we just you know that's how we operate with this and this is this is quite normal i'm just going to tell you this this is not my story but i know i couldn't find the story but i know i'm pretty convinced it's a true story i may have even told it here but i like the story a man is praying for a bible lord i want a bible but i need some money because he was a bible salesman this is in the 1800s the bible salesman going around this man says lord i really want a bible i think he may have heard a knock on the door or whatever might have happened and there was a coin he went outside no one was there and there was a coin on his doorstep and he knew the bible salesman was coming past and that was enough to buy himself a bible so he didn't know who it was but he maybe thought his neighbor dropped him off dropped it off to be nice and so the bible salesman comes to his house and the guy says praise the lord i was you know knew you were coming and i actually he's a dollar for the your bible you know and then he gave him the bible and the the bible salesman said i was the same dollar because it was his dollar because i gave this dollar to the boat man down there when i came across the river and the guy said to him what boat then there's no boat man there sure well i said i got a cross i gave it to this boat man and i gave him this dollar see where was the boat from who who brought him across right probably the boat got created and there was an angel just brought him across got the dollar put it on his step carried on just another day in god's office that's how and in the christian's office that's how that's how we work i got this picture here because you know i won't talk about this but here for long and i'm just gonna almost done but i just if something let's say a man's leg this man here has got no leg right this that grows back someone prays for him his leg grows back and you've got this before and after photo right that should be enough to make the whole world stop in their tracks every news media in the world put it up and say look people it should make great men of the world stop what they're doing look into this scientist everyone and say what's going on here tell me what's going on like how did this person's leg grow back can anybody here tell me get give me bring me all your knowledge bring me everything how did here's a photo of before and after he's no leg here's a leg i want someone like men that are in charge of running the world should say i want some answers about what's going on here something's going on here you understand like this is like they should say this is we can't just carry on living what's going on here like we can't just pretend there's something unusual happen here could you explain to me what happened all the doctors everyone would say uh we've actually got no idea how this this is not possible you say okay well then that's one thing we got this is not possible because it happened so what do we do with that information then who does the impossible you know one miracle should convict the whole world they should be like wow we we need to actually find out who did this what the like the pharisees you know they were arguing with he should have been healed on the sabbath day pinch yourself somebody just a blind man could now see but you know the bible said they could do nothing they could say nothing because the man was standing in the emergency of blind man he was hey guys uh all you're fussing i can actually see you're missing the point i can see but this should make the whole humanity the whole of humanity stop in their tracks and say what is going on here really when you think about it like this this this should be the most like a human body part growing back should be the most outstanding event in the history of mankind forget about some sort of thing we can make and do and send the satellite up we we know how to do that we've done it all and we've worked it out scientifically worked out this one yeah it's incredible i'm just going to close with these few scriptures and this is the one that i read at the start but just now now thinking about it with the way that we are if therefore the whole church become together in one place and all speak with tongues and they come and those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but a full prophesy all or actually all don't don't limit yourself if all all everybody we're all supernatural they think oh no i'm just quite natural no you're not fact check you're not natural amen you're not you're supernatural you don't you believe in what i just told you you're very supernatural you're strange you know hey bring it on i enjoy this like brother braham said leave me alone i feel happy this way you know that's that's what we are but you see strange makes a difference supernatural makes a difference because we keep on reading but if all prophesy all prophesy and you come in one that believeth not or one unlearned it could be well educated but he's unlearned scientist but unlearned that actually no no all you're learning you're bound there's actually a supernatural god out there he is convinced of all because you see once he experiences that you're gonna argue him out of it they knew what was in my glove box of my car and nobody else did he'll never be unconvinced of that argument ever in his entire life he'll go to the grave thinking something happened in that little church i went to something told that that wasn't normal you could have told him many things he'll argue reason them away but he'll never he or she will never ever reason that away their entire life he is convinced of all he is judgeable and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of truth god was there what did you do on the weekend i went to church with one of my friends and god was there amen closing scripture wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order and i just want to close with this last thought now that was the last slide and i don't know where this thought came from but maybe it's i won't labor on it too long but you know we sometimes think that we are sort of moved on from all this stuff you know i don't know in my mind i've never been able to rationalize that i'm like why it would be like saying you know you've got this fantastic car in the garage you know like it's the most awesome car you've ever had and you say i'm just going to go to the shop so you're going to take the car no i think i'll walk how far is it how about 10ks oh well do you like walking no but you know i'll walk why you've got this thing parked in your garage like you're gonna walk like we've got all this stuff we're a supernatural people you think we're gonna oh no i wouldn't know about that dang i got this car here man i'm not gonna leave that parked in the garage we we we in god as a bride we move we just we move on we keep the car and we go further more places you know we we don't this this stuff convinces people's hearts they come in and say they say god was there whereas there are supernatural people there's something going on in that fellowship god was there and this is not just fellowship this is the way you live your life too like you know what's going to happen tomorrow you know the season you're in you know the way your life's going you know the promises and you know how it's going to happen sister hannah you knew what was going to happen with your visa you knew it you weren't hoping it you knew it because somewhere along the line god told you you're going to get your visa that's what happened it wasn't like oh i wasn't sure about that that was a bit dicey you knew you were going to get your visa because god told you you're going to get your visa that's why you just did all the things you needed to do you don't just walk along not knowing what the future's going to be you know the future you know the promises and you can watch them come to pass in your life that that's how that's what you are that's what everyone in here is you're not you you don't just live and not know anything that's going on you know you know it all and the more you accept that the more you can just start to live like that and say well i just yeah i understand all this i know this i just said oh it's like i had little davey no goes through his little seasons and he i think he may have just turned 17 and i just got this thing to say you know and his because he was sort of in his brain he was going along with all these lies and that hitting heading in a certain direction and i said your 17th year all those things are going to be uncovered satan's going to all the god's going to uncover all those little lies that have been plaguing that have been leading you in that way god's going to start to undo all those and then the 18th year is going to be different it's your 17th year that's what it's going to all slowly be undone right and i told him he thought i was crazy that's what's going to happen 17th year and he might be watching almost and he was about a week ago i kind of feud i was like man his 18th birthday is coming up and you know we don't want to get to doubting but sometimes we just you know watch out when you get tired or something you know you know that when you get be careful of those things when you get tired when you get worn and when you get physically worn and brother brandon even said that's when satan comes in when you get like that just relax don't do anything don't think about nothing just maybe go to sleep or don't don't dwell on things because you'll then in a weakened mental state you'll then maybe slip into a bit of a moan and then when you do that same song ah so you didn't really believe after all i just say no i do i was just tired yeah yeah and then then i write a song you might have heard me say that but this is really what i think i write as song to the opposite and i said this is my confession um it was coming up and and i was getting it down i was like lord you know i know that's what's going to happen because that's the business we're in right we know what the future's going to be we just we just know what it's going to be like we know how it's going to end up we we're not walking in darkness we're walking in light and and god can tell us what's going to happen tomorrow the next week or season that's how we operate that's that's how life works for us that is just very normal this is not like this is not new stuff for us this is normal and and and i was like well i just i just want to see i just want like i know that was what you were going to do and he was almost about 10 18 i'm like i've seen a lot of things you know and then i'd ask them if you wanted to work for us again different bits and pieces over time it was always doing this doing that and then i was like i just randomly thought i'll send them this text out of the blue do you want to why don't you work for us and move live at home you send me a text back and maybe i will and i just say this because the day before on his last day of his 17th year he moved back home so when you woke up on his 18th birthday he's living at home and um i'm thinking to myself okay this this is i think this is a different season now i believe this is a different season what are the odds you know like and then it's going to go another way it's not going to be an easy you know the the lord's working but i think i look back i look i think there's something in there i didn't plan it that way i didn't really think it was as i knew it was his birthday but i didn't plan anything like that i just sent him any and so it felt like okay the first day he wakes up on his 18th birthday he's back home and now i can start to but that that it wasn't really a surprise because i was like no something it's going to be different somehow that was the 70th year then the 18th year is going to be different and then when you wake up on the 18th the first day of the 18th year and you think okay that guy's in the room there this is different he wants to work again this is different but that's how we operate that's how we that's how we as christians that's just another day for us it's another day for you we're all just very supernatural if you think you're natural never think that again go on your feelings oh no i should go on feelings now go on your feelings i shouldn't say that too loud because you've got to have a bit of temperance with it but try it you know try it this is this is the god we serve you can just hear him hear his voice speak to you and and he can tell you things and he knows the future just like he knows the past it's not a big deal here you want to know what's going on lord what's going to happen here he can tell you what's going to happen there just like you can tell the past he can tell the future sister jenny knows the future that's why she sings these songs because that's the future she says it's all going to be all right because she knows that it's going to be right she knows this is why it's all going to work out and it'll work out as she thought it would because god said it's going to work out this way that's that's not we're just happy when it comes to passport like i just knew it knew this would be this way that's how it works let some stand and sing tonight i just want to let's just sing a few songs i just want to sing that song um my god is awesome we serve a supernatural god that does the impossible and we have the impossible dwelling in us the the doer of impossible things dwelling in us so we are just very very supernatural spiritual people we're a peculiar people very peculiar but peculiar is what changes people do we have that song up there brother [Music] i'll just pray this
