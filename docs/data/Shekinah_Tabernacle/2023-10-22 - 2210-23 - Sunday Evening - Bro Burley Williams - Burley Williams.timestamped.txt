[24:40] brother Michael
[24:44] Maloney and then Sister Kim and Amy and
[24:47] I think a few other sisters is that
[24:48] correct
[24:50] do there yeah
[24:52] yeah
[24:54] on I got
[24:56] you yep
[25:09] well God bless you everybody it's good
[25:11] to be here I love Camp everywhere you go
[25:14] there's a great atmosphere so I just
[25:17] appreciate that so I just wanted to do
[25:20] this song I don't do items very much but
[25:23] when I do I like to make sure that the
[25:25] Lord's in it otherwise what's the point
[25:28] so I just want to read some of the words
[25:30] from here and kind of open up a little
[25:33] bit of why he means so much to me so
[25:37] here's just halfway through the second
[25:38] verse I'll be up there anyway it's like
[25:41] the price for my heart I don't have a
[25:44] context for that kind of love I don't
[25:46] understand and I can't
[25:48] comprehend and it was like growing up
[25:51] like we've heard so much about the
[25:52] darkness and coming into the light and
[25:54] that's what we're coming into is the
[25:57] light and is brother Isaac preached last
[25:59] night and it's like I spent so much time
[26:01] in darkness and you never realize
[26:03] there's another way it's like not to be
[26:05] all sad and sopy cuz that's lame that's
[26:07] like like like I had Suicidal Thoughts
[26:10] From like 8 till 17 and I thought that
[26:12] was normal I thought like everyone had
[26:15] those thoughts it was just that's what
[26:17] was normal for me so I just appreciate
[26:21] like when you're always in stuff you
[26:23] can't see where you've come out of it
[26:25] but our testimony when we look back
[26:28] from where we came from and how for me
[26:31] it was so black and then you come and
[26:33] it's there's life and vibrancy and
[26:46] love and and in the bridge it just
[26:48] reminds me of where we came from my
[26:51] heart has been in your sights long
[26:53] before my first breath running into your
[26:55] arms is running to life from death
[26:58] and I feel this Rush deep in my chest
[27:00] your mercy is calling out just as I am
[27:03] you pull me in I know I need you now
[27:05] it's like that Rush deep in my chest
[27:08] like last night I was like I'm a human
[27:10] male I will not
[27:14] cry and then that rush comes into your
[27:16] chest and it just melts your defenses
[27:19] and you just can't not so I trust it's a
[27:22] blessing to at least one of
[27:26] you

[41:12] to this part we're in the atmosphere
[41:15] already cuz music is to create an
[41:17] atmosphere um and I feel the presence of
[41:19] God here and and um two things I really
[41:24] want to reiterate what brother Ben the
[41:26] word he gave because I think that was
[41:29] from the
[41:30] Lord and you know to to to think about
[41:33] it tonight in the services think about
[41:35] their word sincerity just and search
[41:37] your heart you know it wasn't a
[41:38] coincidence I was thinking Lord I've got
[41:40] no I don't have anything coming there
[41:42] was just nothing nothing nothing right
[41:43] to the very end I thought oh well I'll
[41:44] just go with nothing think I think
[41:47] what's your word no word today but but
[41:49] that's God shown that he you know he he
[41:52] had a word and and and I just think we
[41:55] should be sinere tonight be real sincere
[41:58] cuz the spirit of God can really move
[42:00] when we are when we are sincere and and
[42:04] one of the sisters here said you know
[42:05] she said oh 2023 has been a hard year I
[42:09] don't know if it's just
[42:10] me but I've had probably the hardest
[42:13] year in my entire
[42:14] [Music]
[42:15] life it's been unusually hard and I
[42:19] don't know if it's just me or if it's
[42:20] kind of universal
[42:23] is but I wouldn't be surprised if it's
[42:25] Universal because the Lord's just
[42:27] working but you know when you go through
[42:29] trials and you go through hardship it it
[42:31] something comes out your faith does a
[42:33] sincerity does a reverence does a hope
[42:36] does it
[42:38] just something's happening in the
[42:40] spiritual realm that that the presence
[42:42] of God the spirit of God is is moving on
[42:45] his people and is is making something of
[42:47] them so let's um let's stand tonight and
[42:50] sing Lord we come to you and worship no

[47:32] in the house of the
[47:37] Lord I would like
[47:43] to oh there we
[47:49] go let's turn to um Isaiah chapter
[47:54] 1
[48:05] Isaiah chapter 1 and uh we'll go to
[48:08] verse
[48:14] 18 he said come now and let us reason
[48:19] together says the
[48:21] Lord though your sins be as Scarlet yes
[48:25] they shall be as white as
[48:27] snow though they be red like Crimson
[48:30] they shall be as
[48:32] waro if you be willing and obedient you
[48:36] shall eat the good of the land but if
[48:38] you refuse and rebel you shall be
[48:41] devoured with the sword for the mouth of
[48:44] the Lord has spoken it amen you may bece
[48:49] it also like to read Acts chapter
[48:54] 16
[48:59] verse
[49:06] 25 acts 16 and
[49:09] 25 it said and it
[49:12] midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang
[49:16] Praises unto God and the prisoners heard
[49:19] them and suddenly there was a great
[49:22] earthquake so that the foundation of the
[49:25] prison was broken and immediately all
[49:28] the doors was open and everyone's bands
[49:31] was
[49:32] loosed and The Keeper of the prisoner
[49:35] awakened out of his sleep seeing the
[49:37] prison doors open he drew out his sword
[49:41] and would have killed himself supposing
[49:43] that the prisoners have been fled but
[49:47] Paul cried with a loud voice saying do
[49:50] thyself no harm for we are all here
[49:55] praise the Lord God bless you this
[49:59] evening amen we we thank the god the
[50:02] Lord for the reading of his word we
[50:04] enjoyed the sweet songs of Zion we
[50:07] enjoyed the praise and we enjoyed the
[50:10] worship I know we might be a little
[50:12] tired and body uh this evening been a
[50:15] long day so we'll try to get through as
[50:18] quick as possible if the Lord would help
[50:21] us amen amen I just thank God for his
[50:24] grace and mercy
[50:26] you know God is a God uh that set he
[50:29] come to not bring us into bondage God
[50:32] come to set us
[50:34] free this message is our
[50:37] Jubilee to come and set us free do you
[50:41] believe that amen I believe that uh God
[50:44] want to set people free in this camp we
[50:47] come here for a purpose we come here for
[50:50] a reason and there's so many things to
[50:53] uh deal with and uh we just pray that
[50:55] the Lord will direct us
[50:57] amen um I I I read the scripture in Acts
[51:01] 16 for a reason because this is
[51:05] beautiful that this in Deliverance God
[51:08] got different ways of deliver amen God
[51:12] got different ways of setting people
[51:14] free sometimes you can just show
[51:16] somebody love and you can set them
[51:20] free sometimes uh you can just make a
[51:22] phone call say something is some body
[51:26] they can be in bondage of something it
[51:28] could set them free there so many so
[51:30] many little simple things but in this
[51:33] case right here they sing
[51:37] songs amen right here I'm always amazed
[51:42] with the Scripture it said Paul and
[51:44] Silas prayed yes at midnight they prayed
[51:48] sang praises and God and the prisoners
[51:51] heard them just think about this they're
[51:53] in a prison
[51:56] singing this isn't a prison like we have
[51:59] today I mean they didn't have prisons
[52:01] like we got today you can lift waks and
[52:04] play pool and watch TV and play cards
[52:07] and stuff that's not the type of prison
[52:09] they was in the prison that they was in
[52:12] their hands be locked when their feet be
[52:14] locked and they be sitting down and they
[52:16] be bowing they have rats and things
[52:19] running all around them and that's what
[52:21] kind of prison like a dungeon that they
[52:23] was in but in the midst of of all of
[52:25] that they was able to
[52:27] pray they was able to sing songs in the
[52:31] midst of all of that let me tell you
[52:33] sometimes brother and sister when you're
[52:34] going through something you can't even
[52:36] think of the word just start
[52:39] praising you can't even think of
[52:40] scripture just start singing because
[52:43] that could bring a breakthrough Just In
[52:45] Praise amen but the one thing I like
[52:48] about this the power that has been
[52:51] invested in The Believer sometimes
[52:53] somebody else can be bound but your
[52:55] action can set them free there's things
[52:58] that you can say and do and set them
[52:59] free like sometimes you come to church
[53:01] some people come to church and maybe had
[53:03] a hard day and work and things just W
[53:05] going right come in then when the
[53:07] worship service start and they sit there
[53:09] don't want to clap their hands or so
[53:11] forth that don't mean you
[53:13] shouldn't sometimes it just take you to
[53:16] start shouting giving God some praise
[53:19] and start singing and then the spirit
[53:21] move think about this in prison and the
[53:24] Bible said the prisoners heard them what
[53:27] you think those prisoners was sitting in
[53:28] there doing when they hearing Paul them
[53:30] saying they probably saying this is
[53:32] nonsense here we are locked up don't
[53:35] know when we going to get out and they
[53:36] going to choose to sing here's the thing
[53:39] about it brothers and sisters they might
[53:40] was locked up but Paul's Spirit wasn't
[53:42] in
[53:43] prison they Spirit wasn't in prison
[53:46] their body was there but their Spirit
[53:48] wasn't in prison and as they begin to
[53:51] sing I like the Scripture it say
[53:53] suddenly there was a great earthquake
[53:55] Quake not a small earthquake but a great
[53:59] earthquake but you got to understand
[54:01] this earthquake it ain't the earthquake
[54:04] that you and I would think it is I know
[54:06] up here in uh uh New Zealand you got
[54:09] earthquakes and some maybe be live and
[54:11] still active and so forth but you notice
[54:13] earthquakes use to tear up
[54:16] stuff right make houses sink make
[54:18] building fall and all these sorts of
[54:21] things but this earthquake right here
[54:23] was a detonated earthquake
[54:26] this earthquake had a special delivery
[54:28] from God because this earthquake it
[54:31] didn't shake the Earth this earthquake
[54:34] it shut
[54:35] foundations this earthquake when it was
[54:38] shaken it this earthquake was designed
[54:40] to make doors open this earthquake can
[54:43] we say Amen it only it made the doors
[54:46] open and then every B bands was loosed
[54:49] so this was a special earthquake sent
[54:52] from God so it could make change come
[54:55] come off so it can make doors open can
[54:58] we say amen and when God sunk that
[55:00] earthquake the doors open chains come
[55:03] out but you know what he made nobody
[55:05] step out the door they had to step out
[55:07] the door themselves God made the way but
[55:10] they had to step out themselves so when
[55:12] God speak to you in this service we can
[55:14] see chains come off you can see doors
[55:17] open but you got yourself got to walk
[55:19] out and say I accept what God has given
[55:22] me
[55:24] today
[55:25] amen you have to make that step praise
[55:29] the Lord that's why we need an
[55:31] earthquake and this Earth these bodies
[55:35] need a shaken in these bodies that's why
[55:38] the earthquake need to be praise God I
[55:42] just really love that
[55:44] scripture and it came by singing and
[55:46] praising if they can that can happen by
[55:49] singing and praising what about you and
[55:51] me when the lips is on your lips when
[55:53] the word is on your lips and you know
[55:55] what to speak when deity become on human
[55:57] lips again because this is the hour that
[55:59] we're living in can we say praise the
[56:04] Lord looking here at the
[56:07] scriptures and I want to read another
[56:09] quote
[56:12] here and we don't I don't take these
[56:15] things like me in the message come
[56:19] follow
[56:20] me but the man said here is what it is
[56:24] yes what's in the kid is going to come
[56:27] out no matter what it is it's got is
[56:31] going to come out this is a story when
[56:33] he was talking about he wish he can get
[56:35] his children just take them out there
[56:37] and live out in the wilderness and and
[56:39] the and somewhere and just keep them
[56:40] away from society he didn't want them to
[56:42] be around Society so he said but then as
[56:45] he thought about all that he said it
[56:47] makes no different what's in them going
[56:48] to come out that's why I was mentioned
[56:51] in the first service amen what inside of
[56:54] everybody going to to come out but we
[56:56] try to keep it in no let it come out
[56:59] whatever need to come out let it come
[57:01] out and then when it come out deal with
[57:04] it can we say amen he said listen what
[57:09] he said it's going to come out if it's
[57:13] evil in there it'll come out in the
[57:17] Indian Camp if it's good in there it'll
[57:19] come out in any Camp listen it's what's
[57:24] in the the kid the makeup of the kid
[57:28] what's on the inside of you and what you
[57:31] are now is what you are probably to be
[57:34] the rest of your life you're life you're
[57:37] on a changing
[57:40] spot now I want you to listen to this
[57:42] very
[57:44] carefully he said did you know what
[57:48] 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ
[57:52] is done before the are 21 years
[57:58] old
[58:00] 86% listen what he says it shows it
[58:04] statistics shows it 86% that come to
[58:08] Christ come before their
[58:11] 21 21 he said after you pass that age
[58:15] listen to it carefully now I I'm not
[58:18] saying that I just believe in what the
[58:19] prophet said evidently he's looking at
[58:22] something he's looking at something he
[58:25] said after you pass that age you become
[58:29] more
[58:30] molded and set in your
[58:35] ways isn't that the
[58:37] truth isn't it you know when children
[58:40] grow uh you know when your child is
[58:43] little you can tell them anything they
[58:44] believe
[58:46] you you can tell your son you can beat
[58:49] up
[58:50] Superman he'll believe
[58:53] it he'll as he grow up he'll tell
[58:56] everybody my daddy can beat up anybody
[58:58] nobody can beat my daddy he'll actually
[59:01] believe it because in that time of his
[59:03] life he's he he daddy is his hero he'll
[59:07] receive it but as he get
[59:10] older Daddy can say I can beat up
[59:12] Superman he'll go yeah
[59:15] right huh but at that time he'll believe
[59:19] it that's why we need to be like
[59:21] children when it come to the Lord Jesus
[59:23] Christ we'll take everything thing that
[59:25] he said we don't question
[59:27] it but he says this right here you
[59:30] become molded and set in your way now I
[59:34] like how he balanced it it's possible
[59:37] sure they come 70 80 years old but it's
[59:42] very rare he ain't saying it's not
[59:44] possible it is possible you make
[59:47] yourself when you're
[59:50] young you set your Ambitions to what you
[59:53] want to do and what you're trying to
[59:56] achieve in life you think of it and as
[59:59] you think of it of course your mind is
[1:00:02] presented in your mind by an unknown
[1:00:05] something that dominates your mind and
[1:00:08] when and when it becomes in your mind
[1:00:11] then you speak it that you're going to
[1:00:13] do it and then your Ambitions drive you
[1:00:17] to it are y'all with me so far that's
[1:00:21] why you need to know be careful what you
[1:00:23] think even when you're young set your
[1:00:25] Ambitions and your heart on the right
[1:00:27] things not the wrong
[1:00:30] things I pray to God that tonight if you
[1:00:33] set free if you're not been set free
[1:00:35] from something and you're in bondage God
[1:00:37] can set you free even as the word Goes
[1:00:41] Forth I believe in altar calls I make
[1:00:43] altar calls but sometimes you don't have
[1:00:46] to come to the altar God can deal with
[1:00:48] you exactly right where you're
[1:00:50] at you can take the word yourself say
[1:00:52] God I receive it right now I'm I'm
[1:00:54] delivered right now I ain't got to wait
[1:00:56] till the end of the service I ain't got
[1:00:58] to wait for the last service to be
[1:00:59] preached I can be set free right now but
[1:01:02] sometimes people don't know how to be
[1:01:04] set
[1:01:06] free let me tell you something in the
[1:01:08] very moment God deals with your heart
[1:01:10] the Bible said when you hear his voice
[1:01:12] Harden not your hearts soon as God speak
[1:01:16] to you say God here am I I'm laying
[1:01:18] myself on the altar right now here am I
[1:01:21] I want to be free you don't want to be
[1:01:23] in abundance
[1:01:25] can we say praise the lord lord I
[1:01:30] pray a lot of things been
[1:01:32] missing in the in the
[1:01:36] gospel even in growth I challenge young
[1:01:39] boys to be men because it's important
[1:01:43] man supposed to be the strong one all
[1:01:45] right he supposed to be the leader can
[1:01:47] we say

[1:01:52] actually supposed to protect your sister

[1:02:46] now the beautiful
[1:02:49] thing I I even teach my son so whether
[1:02:53] they do it or not I still teach how did
[1:02:55] a young man ought to be protective of
[1:02:57] his
[1:02:58] sister that when some boy want to talk

[1:04:14] breast what shall we do for our sister
[1:04:17] in the day when she shall be spoken of
[1:04:20] this is speaking of a daughter A a
[1:04:22] brother saying I got a sister has no

[1:11:18] today amen I didn't have a father to
[1:11:22] teach me

[1:11:29] father to you I'll be a mother to you
[1:11:31] I'll be a friend to you this message
[1:11:33] made me what I
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:39] am praise the
[1:11:41] Lord that's why I challenge a young man
[1:11:44] to be a man I love to see a young man
[1:11:46] just get to such stability in life and
[1:11:48] then the get the father gives him
[1:11:50] permission and so forth as he go on in
[1:11:52] life I I like to see a man this is me
[1:11:55] now I like to see a young man even
[1:11:57] wedding time come he can say sir I can
[1:11:59] pay for my own wedding all
[1:12:02] right if you want to help fine but I got
[1:12:05] it I've been working on this I've been
[1:12:07] planning this I've been preparing
[1:12:11] this H are you going to get married and
[1:12:14] take her take her back to your parents'
[1:12:19] house Jesus gave us a better example
[1:12:22] than that what did he tell his bride I
[1:12:24] go prepare a place for you so when you
[1:12:27] know you're going to get married youall
[1:12:29] got to have something prepare so you can
[1:12:30] take her to
[1:12:36] there praise the
[1:12:41] Lord huh
[1:12:44] sisters what about
[1:12:47] you when God brings a woman and a man
[1:12:51] together he do not take a woman woman
[1:12:53] from a man's
[1:12:55] head for her to lead that
[1:12:58] man she don't take the he didn't take
[1:13:01] the woman from a man's foot so that man
[1:13:04] can step all over her he took her from
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:08] side a
[1:13:12] rib do you realize
[1:13:15] sister if you if a person don't have
[1:13:19] ribs in their body you know what happens
[1:13:22] it slums
[1:13:25] there's no structure and what do your
[1:13:27] ribs do your ribs protects your vital
[1:13:33] organs so sister when you marry a man
[1:13:35] God took you from the rib your place and
[1:13:38] your position is to protect his
[1:13:42] heart protect his emotions protect his
[1:13:45] feelings give him stability strengthen
[1:13:50] him because in the Bible when they want
[1:13:52] to kill a man quick they hit him in the
[1:13:54] fifth rib so you can kill him quick or
[1:13:56] you can bring him up
[1:14:01] quick huh so that position falls on you
[1:14:04] sister when that man come home from work
[1:14:08] grumpy no nobody want to be around him
[1:14:10] sometime the devil don't even want to be
[1:14:12] around him they be so
[1:14:13] grumpy can you as a woman see that man
[1:14:17] condition say hold on a minute let me
[1:14:19] change the
[1:14:20] atmosphere let me change the atmosphere
[1:14:23] pull him back down did not the prophet
[1:14:25] said it's a wonderful thing when a man
[1:14:27] can come home to his
[1:14:29] Queen Hall
[1:14:32] hallu but what if he come home work hard
[1:14:35] tired then he finally make it in the
[1:14:37] house but when he get in the house here
[1:14:38] goes
[1:14:42] Queeny oh oh oh you back oh dinner be
[1:14:45] ready in a minute
[1:14:52] microwave
[1:14:54] hey marriage is not try out friends it's
[1:14:58] something you pray about the prophet
[1:15:00] said pray about these things is because
[1:15:02] you can ruin your life if you mess it
[1:15:10] up praise the
[1:15:15] Lord I want you to notice Isaiah well
[1:15:18] proverbs 30 first Proverbs 30: 12 says
[1:15:23] is
[1:15:24] this there is a
[1:15:27] generation that appear in their own
[1:15:32] eyes and yet is not washed from their
[1:15:37] ftiness that's a strong scripture this
[1:15:39] is this generation that we're living in
[1:15:41] that P in their own eyes where do that
[1:15:44] Spirit come from it come from Le theia
[1:15:46] it's an anointing on the L of sin age to
[1:15:48] make people think they're pure in their
[1:15:50] own eyes but don't realize they're blind
[1:15:53] naked and
[1:15:55] miserable but that's why God sent this
[1:15:57] message for you and I so we don't be p
[1:16:00] in our own eyes we want to be peing his
[1:16:02] eyes not our own
[1:16:06] eyes what we read in Isaiah
[1:16:09] 1
[1:16:11] reasoning but I want talk about the
[1:16:13] power of reasoning because you can't
[1:16:15] take the thing
[1:16:19] lightly God
[1:16:21] reasons there's a good reason
[1:16:23] and there is a bad
[1:16:25] reasoning how many you know God
[1:16:28] reasons let's see how God reason which
[1:16:30] we already read it God said this come
[1:16:34] now let us reason
[1:16:37] together that God going to reason with
[1:16:40] me yeah see God he can reason with me
[1:16:43] come on all right God let's let's let's
[1:16:44] just do this let's do this and God
[1:16:48] says although your sins be as Scarlet
[1:16:50] they shall be white as snow though they
[1:16:52] be like Crimson they shall be be as wo
[1:16:56] if you be willing and obedient you shall
[1:16:58] eat the good of the land god
[1:17:00] reasoning but if you're noticing God
[1:17:02] reasoning he don't ask you what you
[1:17:05] think about
[1:17:07] it he tells you this is how it's going
[1:17:10] to be you either do this or that but we
[1:17:14] want God to reason say Lord you know my
[1:17:17] heart I know you understand
[1:17:20] me now Lord I know what I'm going to do
[1:17:24] is contrary to your
[1:17:26] word I know that but you're a loving
[1:17:30] God and you know my heart you think God
[1:17:34] listen to something like that
[1:17:40] no they say oh brother brother preacher
[1:17:43] happy man Family Camp preacher happy no
[1:17:45] I'm going to preach you the
[1:17:48] truth exactly what I'm going to do I'm
[1:17:49] going to preach you the
[1:17:52] truth
[1:17:54] I come here to please one
[1:17:56] person and it ain't brother
[1:17:59] Ben it's Jesus
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:04] Christ I appreciate it people I enjoyed
[1:18:07] the service I enjoy I appreciate every
[1:18:09] bit of that but what I look for if God
[1:18:11] say good job
[1:18:15] son I want my okay from him cuz that's
[1:18:19] what it means to me it means so much to
[1:18:21] me reasoning
[1:18:24] let's look at the
[1:18:26] definition the definition of reason it
[1:18:28] means the process of forming
[1:18:32] conclusions judgments or inferences from
[1:18:35] Facts or premises the act of process of
[1:18:39] reaching a decision or conclusion so
[1:18:41] when you reasoning about something you
[1:18:43] actually got to find a conclusion where
[1:18:45] you can say this is it this is what I'm
[1:18:48] going to do now I don't reason it
[1:18:51] out
[1:18:53] but then that's what Webster
[1:18:56] says but when I look into the message
[1:18:59] the prophet give his definition of
[1:19:01] reasoning this come from the message the
[1:19:03] conflict between God and Satan he said
[1:19:06] but God can't give nothing else but his
[1:19:10] word because that's what he chose first
[1:19:14] and when man makes a decision has to
[1:19:17] ever remain that way he said I'm sorry
[1:19:20] when God makes a decision it has to ever
[1:19:24] remain that way and I'm so glad the
[1:19:26] prophet put it that way he he always
[1:19:28] makes statements if God save a man one
[1:19:31] way if another another person meet the
[1:19:33] same recommendation God will have to do
[1:19:35] the same thing for him that's why I'm so
[1:19:37] thankful when you're going through
[1:19:38] something in life he said in the message
[1:19:40] uh experiences I believe it is no
[1:19:42] identification he said when you're going
[1:19:44] through something find a character in
[1:19:46] the Bible that you can relate to and
[1:19:49] whatever God done for them he'll do the
[1:19:51] exact same thing for you
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:57] praise the
[1:19:58] Lord if you're sick got an infirmity in
[1:20:01] the body go back to the scripture when
[1:20:04] the woman touch the him on His
[1:20:07] Garment your Revelation should be
[1:20:09] stronger than
[1:20:10] hersl cuz we got evidences we got proof
[1:20:13] but this sister didn't even have
[1:20:15] scripture she had no scripture but she
[1:20:18] said if I can just touch the hym of His
[1:20:20] Garment it wasn't the h m h e m what she
[1:20:24] got it from it's the s i m h i m him
[1:20:27] what she got her healing
[1:20:30] from praise God he's the same yesterday
[1:20:34] today and forever the theme of the
[1:20:36] message the prophet ke just telling us
[1:20:39] what he done back then he the same God
[1:20:41] he'll do the same thing right
[1:20:44] now praise
[1:20:47] God he says
[1:20:49] Satan took
[1:20:51] reasoning
[1:20:53] he took the reasoning and attacked the
[1:20:56] word see a reasoning Spirit it attacks
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:06] word he says and Satan took reasoning
[1:21:09] took the reasoning attacked the word
[1:21:11] shook Eve off the path that's right by
[1:21:15] reasoning human reasoning could you just
[1:21:19] imagine when the serpent came and talked
[1:21:21] to eeve can I ask y'all a question when
[1:21:24] had the devil ever stopped using
[1:21:28] scripture
[1:21:30] never he always used scripture he just
[1:21:34] Twisted it he told eeve
[1:21:38] surely you won't
[1:21:40] die look how he throw s how he throw it
[1:21:43] all he came to eeve First
[1:21:47] religious he said
[1:21:49] yay God has said
[1:21:53] I see eeve this brother been in
[1:21:57] church he he quoting God so he he got
[1:22:00] something he used the word of God it
[1:22:02] ain't no different today how you don't
[1:22:04] got so people don't get so slick around
[1:22:06] this mess they always use the word of
[1:22:08] God but you got to catch the
[1:22:12] Twist and you know the story she tell
[1:22:14] him what's going to happen and then he
[1:22:16] just said
[1:22:17] surely you won't
[1:22:20] die now think after the fall took place
[1:22:25] after the fall took place then that
[1:22:27] reasoning could still hold Eve after the
[1:22:30] ACT took place she can
[1:22:32] say wait I'm not
[1:22:35] dead God said surely I would die but I
[1:22:39] partook of it I'm not dead in the
[1:22:41] serpent see God was wrong you're not
[1:22:44] dead but yes you
[1:22:46] was
[1:22:50] spiritually and then later on
[1:22:53] it manifest
[1:22:55] physically exactly what God Said was
[1:22:58] going to happen it happened that's why a
[1:23:00] lot of time what reasoning do when
[1:23:02] people reason against the word you tell
[1:23:04] them don't do this and then they reason
[1:23:07] their way around it they still go do it
[1:23:08] and it seem like they prosper and
[1:23:10] everything all right see I don't see
[1:23:12] nothing happen I'm good no that's qu
[1:23:14] it's just a matter of
[1:23:16] time it'll walk you down because the
[1:23:19] word is true you know the children of
[1:23:21] Israel
[1:23:23] the situation they got
[1:23:24] in after David had died Solomon became
[1:23:28] king what caused Israel to even split
[1:23:31] what caused the enemy to be able to get
[1:23:33] into Israel you know who was caus of it
[1:23:39] Solomon because the law said Moses law
[1:23:42] said do not marry strange wives said if
[1:23:47] you marry them they will turn you from
[1:23:49] serving the lord Solomon thought that
[1:23:52] cause he is the king with so much wisdom
[1:23:55] he can bypass that and it won't affect
[1:23:58] him but he did it he broke the law but
[1:24:01] what did they
[1:24:02] do Solomon got married mared what
[1:24:07] thousand see God still with me I'm good
[1:24:10] I still love the Lord I'm still serving
[1:24:12] the lord so the law of Moses don't work
[1:24:14] on me but you know what they did they
[1:24:17] just
[1:24:18] waited they waited for him to get
[1:24:21] old and when when he got old Solomon yes
[1:24:25] dear I want an altar for my God yes dear
[1:24:30] so the scripture is true when you
[1:24:32] reasoning around that you think you're
[1:24:34] getting away from it it'll catch up with
[1:24:36] you it will catch up it might take a
[1:24:38] matter of time but it'll catch up that's
[1:24:40] why we're not here to preach
[1:24:42] fear I'm just trying to show you how
[1:24:45] powerful that reasoning spirit is cuz I
[1:24:47] have to deal with it I'm not saying I'm
[1:24:50] immune from that sometimes situation
[1:24:53] come up even in the church reason and
[1:24:55] say really be careful you don't want to
[1:24:57] hurt the person and you need to do this
[1:24:59] you don't want to run them off for the
[1:25:00] church and you just be need to be care
[1:25:02] reasoning comes but you know what I do
[1:25:04] whoa what the word they broke the word
[1:25:06] yes let's go back and to the word say
[1:25:09] what they did we'll make the decision
[1:25:10] from there because the word is the
[1:25:14] absolute are we all
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:19] right he said now the only way that she
[1:25:23] could have got to disbelieve God
[1:25:26] word it had to be a
[1:25:29] pilling Satan knows how to make
[1:25:32] reasoning appealing it has to appeal to
[1:25:35] you sin is very appealing there's only
[1:25:39] one sin and that's unbelief so it is
[1:25:42] really appealing Satan makes it
[1:25:44] appealing so he began to talk about
[1:25:46] reason he said reasoning is appealing
[1:25:48] then he comes down in the message take
[1:25:50] on the whole armor of God I'm just
[1:25:52] giving you the definitions the prophet
[1:25:54] gave he said notice Satan tried to get
[1:25:56] in there to spy out to see how he could
[1:25:59] get a hold of that human
[1:26:01] race cuz you remember the devil know he
[1:26:04] can't create but he had to find a way to
[1:26:07] get it to the human race he had to do
[1:26:09] that and this is what he was looking for
[1:26:12] he knew he could not get to
[1:26:14] Adam Satan knew that I ain't no need to
[1:26:16] be bothering this man but when he seen
[1:26:19] Eve come to the picture he said I got
[1:26:22] Avenue I can work with
[1:26:24] now he took one of the most famous
[1:26:28] tactics
[1:26:29] well it showed that he had to be a
[1:26:33] supernatural power to think of it he
[1:26:36] even telling Satan had to be a
[1:26:37] supernatural power to even think of
[1:26:43] reasoning you got to remember sin didn't
[1:26:46] start in the book of
[1:26:48] Genesis sin started in
[1:26:51] heaven what what makes us think we can
[1:26:54] take this Christian Life easy
[1:26:58] lightly when this
[1:27:00] devil in heaven in a perfect
[1:27:05] place he was able to deceive angels in a
[1:27:09] perfect place in the presence of God he
[1:27:13] was able to go right in there and tell
[1:27:14] him a lie and deceive
[1:27:19] them that's the power that that devil
[1:27:21] got
[1:27:23] but look at the look at the confidence
[1:27:25] God got in his bride they was in a
[1:27:27] perfect place and fail now God will put
[1:27:30] you and me in the worst age and he say
[1:27:32] we won't
[1:27:33] fail that's the confidence he got in you
[1:27:36] and me why won't we fail cuz we'll stay
[1:27:39] behind that word we won't reason with it
[1:27:41] if God said it that settles
[1:27:45] it amen I hear people say all the time
[1:27:49] God said it I believe it that settles it
[1:27:52] no sir God said it that settles it
[1:27:55] whether you believe it or not it's still
[1:27:58] settled God's word has been settle in
[1:28:00] the heavens the Bible tells
[1:28:08] us Satan tried to get there he said it
[1:28:11] showed he had to be a supernatural power
[1:28:13] to think of it he used this the first
[1:28:16] time and was
[1:28:19] successful he's done it ever since still
[1:28:22] successful to a certain estate he used
[1:28:26] reasoning against
[1:28:30] Faith Satan came to Ed to begin to
[1:28:33] reason against the word of God the great
[1:28:35] armor that God had fortified his people
[1:28:38] with he be to use
[1:28:41] reasoning it's only reasonable that God
[1:28:44] would not destroy you surely you will
[1:28:46] not die but remember friends that Satan
[1:28:50] taed it to begin with he still uses the
[1:28:53] same thing and still successful with it
[1:28:58] reasoning hallu as he begin to go on
[1:29:01] down about reasoning in the message the
[1:29:03] uncertain sound he said
[1:29:06] reasoning cast down reasoning that's the
[1:29:08] scripture we read at the first service
[1:29:10] when in Corinthians said cast down
[1:29:12] reasoning anything that would exalt
[1:29:14] itself above the word of God just cast
[1:29:16] it down when something is against the
[1:29:18] word of God you know it don't try to
[1:29:20] reason around it just cast it now that's
[1:29:23] just that
[1:29:24] simple but what makes it so hard
[1:29:27] sometimes when the devil presents
[1:29:28] something to you so
[1:29:31] tempting then you want to try to find a
[1:29:33] way around it he says this cast down
[1:29:36] reasonings cast them down God don't want
[1:29:39] you to have
[1:29:40] reason he gives another definition
[1:29:43] reason always
[1:29:46] tries to find a way
[1:29:50] out
[1:29:52] out from what
[1:30:00] word he says this Faith don't
[1:30:04] reason Faith just
[1:30:06] believes your mind what makes you reason
[1:30:09] it's a
[1:30:10] liar the liar detective proves that God
[1:30:13] Bible First proves it but your soul is
[1:30:15] Immortal brother sister he said your
[1:30:18] reasoning power will leave you When
[1:30:22] Death strikes you but your soul will be
[1:30:25] with you through eternity won't you
[1:30:28] believe God works today and accept him
[1:30:31] he's
[1:30:33] pleading so reason tries to find a way
[1:30:35] out a trumpet gives an UNS un sound he
[1:30:38] said now the enemy spy
[1:30:40] Satan tried to find out what he could do
[1:30:44] to break into that so he know he just
[1:30:46] can come out and Bluff her talking about
[1:30:48] Eve so the only thing that he could do
[1:30:51] was to to get her on
[1:30:53] reasoning he said God uses today to
[1:30:56] fortify his word is the church is his
[1:30:58] word Satan comes around with reasoning
[1:31:01] power Satan
[1:31:03] know that was the
[1:31:06] loophole that was the place people would
[1:31:09] break the
[1:31:10] easiest was that
[1:31:13] reasoning reasoning makes you
[1:31:16] break makes you give in you can't take
[1:31:20] the pressure so you just say I just go
[1:31:21] ahead let it be I just can't take
[1:31:24] this we can't do that brothers and
[1:31:26] sisters we stay on that fortified word
[1:31:28] we stay with what God bring us today
[1:31:30] stay there and let watch God go to
[1:31:34] work so reasoning make break the easiest
[1:31:39] was it
[1:31:40] reasoning take on the whole arm of God
[1:31:43] he said when Jesus of Nazareth was here
[1:31:44] on Earth he never used his power yet he
[1:31:47] was God manifested In the Flesh he never
[1:31:50] used his power when Satan come against
[1:31:53] him I like that Jesus very easily could
[1:31:56] have smoked Satan right out of
[1:31:59] a but he would have done that we
[1:32:01] wouldn't have nobody to
[1:32:04] fight we wouldn't have nobody we would
[1:32:06] we wouldn't have an adversary we want to
[1:32:08] have somebody to make us stronger Satan
[1:32:11] is a worthy adversary he studies you he
[1:32:14] studies me he knows your weaknesses them
[1:32:17] are the place you have to protect all
[1:32:20] your weak spots you need to protected
[1:32:22] with the word of God cuz Satan actually
[1:32:24] studies you Satan knows how you built
[1:32:29] up some people are built up on
[1:32:32] emotions just built on any little thing
[1:32:34] can just shake them and bother emotional
[1:32:37] person so what the devil will do keep
[1:32:39] bringing things in to mess and shake up
[1:32:41] their emotions he'll find thing make
[1:32:43] sure you run into thing that is going to
[1:32:45] disturb your emotions cuz he studied
[1:32:49] you some people got bad complex problems
[1:32:53] so the devil make things happen so they
[1:32:55] keep continue to get complexes and can't
[1:32:58] break through
[1:33:00] them
[1:33:02] huh praise the Lord like a boy say
[1:33:06] man look at me I'll never get a girl
[1:33:11] look at me flabby
[1:33:15] arms I can't get a girl like that I got
[1:33:19] to do something sat say yeah look at you
[1:33:21] look at you you're

[1:33:26] the
[1:33:31] gym get in the
[1:33:38] mirror she going to like that I'mma have
[1:33:41] some
[1:33:43] guns he rcking on a
[1:33:47] complex Satan say you need to change
[1:33:48] your dress look at you look so
[1:33:50] oldfashioned look at
[1:33:53] you so yeah I need to change clothes
[1:33:56] what happened get in the Facebook get in

[1:34:04] dress then come to
[1:34:10] church like he the cleanest thing in the
[1:34:13] church and don't realize he let the
[1:34:16] devil use him with a
[1:34:20] complex Sur I got a new suit new shoes
[1:34:23] new tie when I walk in church everybody
[1:34:26] going to look at me yeah they probably
[1:34:28] be like what don't happen to
[1:34:32] him then when you don't get the response
[1:34:34] you want you walk out of
[1:34:40] church just let the devil use you like
[1:34:43] that it don't have to be that way let me
[1:34:47] tell you what beauty is let me tell you
[1:34:49] what hen is anybody how of just fill
[1:34:52] with the Holy Ghost is beautiful and
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:35:00] handsome exactly
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:03] right praise
[1:35:06] God reasoning it makes things he said it
[1:35:10] makes it
[1:35:11] appealing reasoning make things
[1:35:13] appealing that's how it does things let
[1:35:16] me just keep going on here cuz I really
[1:35:18] don't want to hold you long I want this
[1:35:20] just to be a impact so that when the
[1:35:23] enemy try to comes and try to get you to
[1:35:25] go around the world you got something
[1:35:27] you can just withstand them say say I
[1:35:28] know exactly what you doing it ain't
[1:35:29] going to
[1:35:32] work let me show you how the spirit
[1:35:35] according to the definition the prophet
[1:35:37] gave I want to show you how it works
[1:35:40] turn with me to Matthew chapter
[1:35:49] 21 reasoning always tried to find a way
[1:35:52] out and know it can make people break
[1:35:54] the eases and reasoning is
[1:35:57] appealing that's a very bad
[1:36:01] spirit in Matthew chapter
[1:36:05] 21 let's go to verse
[1:36:07] 23 when Jesus was coming to the temple
[1:36:12] the chief priest and the Elders of the
[1:36:14] people came to him as he was
[1:36:17] teaching and said by what Authority
[1:36:21] does thou doest these things who gave
[1:36:25] thee this Authority they asked their
[1:36:28] wrong personal
[1:36:32] questions when Jesus answers questions
[1:36:35] it makes mouths be
[1:36:37] shut they can't say nothing back all
[1:36:39] they can do is just get mad and walk
[1:36:42] away that's the way Jesus does things is
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:46] right look at his response Jesus
[1:36:49] answered and said to them I I also will
[1:36:52] ask you one thing not two or three one
[1:36:54] thing just I'm going to ask you one
[1:36:57] thing which if you tell me I am likewise
[1:37:02] will tell you by what Authority I do
[1:37:05] these
[1:37:06] things he said the baptism of John went
[1:37:11] was it from heaven or of man wow that's
[1:37:17] a powerful that's a powerful
[1:37:19] thing now what
[1:37:23] and they
[1:37:26] what
[1:37:28] reason see when a reason
[1:37:33] spirit is
[1:37:35] challenged it got to freeze for a
[1:37:38] moment let me tell you something about a
[1:37:40] reasoning Spirit a reasoning spirit
[1:37:43] always know what the truth
[1:37:46] is it always knows that's why it'll try
[1:37:50] to find a way around around
[1:37:55] it watch this they reason with
[1:37:59] themselves
[1:38:01] saying if we shall say from Heaven he
[1:38:06] will say unto us why do you not then
[1:38:09] believe but if we shall say Amen we Fe
[1:38:13] the people for all hold John as a
[1:38:17] prophet now let me tell you when a
[1:38:18] reasoning spirit is trapped
[1:38:22] the best way it tries to escape is tell
[1:38:25] a
[1:38:27] lie watch what they do they don't reason
[1:38:31] it all out but then they said answer to
[1:38:34] Jesus said we cannot
[1:38:38] tell but they actually
[1:38:43] could see let me tell you when you
[1:38:47] didn't even want a
[1:38:50] child
[1:38:52] you know we inherit by birth a reasoning
[1:38:55] Spirit you do know that right it's
[1:38:58] automatically it's an automatic default
[1:39:00] it just
[1:39:03] there that's why when you're dealing
[1:39:05] with a child and the parents they don't
[1:39:09] done something wrong and the parents
[1:39:11] decide to talk to them and the parent
[1:39:14] begin to ask questions uh why did you do
[1:39:17] why did you do this they'll
[1:39:19] go what
[1:39:23] they already know what they
[1:39:25] did what I do you know what you did no
[1:39:31] explain then the parent begin to break
[1:39:33] it down what they did they
[1:39:38] go I I don't know
[1:39:42] why see that reasoning Spirit now this
[1:39:46] is what children do when they done got
[1:39:48] in trouble on something and they know
[1:39:51] eventually Mom and Dad going to find out
[1:39:53] yeah what does start reasoning that
[1:39:56] reasoning Spirit come say I could go to
[1:40:01] Daddy but if I go to
[1:40:04] Daddy this is what he'll
[1:40:08] say and if I go to Mama this what she
[1:40:12] would
[1:40:15] say I think I better go to
[1:40:19] Grandmama
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:25] sweet old
[1:40:27] grandma Grandma can we talk yeah
[1:40:32] baby I got in
[1:40:34] trouble
[1:40:38] no and and I didn't mean to do
[1:40:42] it I didn't mean to do it she said what
[1:40:46] you what you do baby I just done some
[1:40:49] things I shouldn't done I've been
[1:40:52] talking to boys and they've been
[1:40:54] contacting me and sending letters and
[1:40:56] all kind of things and I didn't I didn't
[1:40:58] mean to do it grandma she said oh baby I
[1:41:00] know you
[1:41:02] did then all of a
[1:41:05] sudden
[1:41:06] Grandma talks to Mom and
[1:41:09] Dad you
[1:41:11] know that's your child I know and I'm
[1:41:15] not telling you what to
[1:41:19] do but sometimes you have to have Grace
[1:41:23] with the
[1:41:24] children and then the child be
[1:41:27] like get him grandama get her
[1:41:31] yeah see what Grandmama don't realize
[1:41:34] the reasoning Spirit jumped off the
[1:41:36] child and no jumped on
[1:41:39] her that's why we need grandmas in this
[1:41:42] message will take that child no you
[1:41:45] wrong you're wrong now come on I'm going
[1:41:47] to take you to your parents I'm going to
[1:41:49] expose you
[1:41:52] that's how it should
[1:41:55] be you remember the prophet said you if
[1:41:58] you got a little kid keep want to go
[1:41:59] over Grandma house and stuff like that
[1:42:01] probably it's a bag of candy or
[1:42:07] something see reasoning it'll make you
[1:42:10] bounce around to get the answer you
[1:42:15] want not what you need but what you
[1:42:19] want
[1:42:21] so they told a
[1:42:23] lie to a lie it's the same thing with
[1:42:27] the
[1:42:28] word something come up in your heart you
[1:42:31] want to go do it then first thing God
[1:42:33] will always visit you with
[1:42:37] truth he'll always visit you with truth
[1:42:39] but now he can't make you receive it now
[1:42:43] it's laying in your lap what I'm going
[1:42:44] to do this or what I ain't gonna do

[1:45:15] it get him to come to
[1:45:17] church she all think I'm joking no I'm
[1:45:20] not joking that's what reasoning does
[1:45:23] reasoning plans everything
[1:45:27] out you remember when David did wrong
[1:45:30] yeah when he got NE when he went to B
[1:45:33] Sheba what did he do he said hey this
[1:45:37] girl this woman is pregnant I got to get
[1:45:38] this man home so I can blame that on him
[1:45:42] I got to find something what he joab how
[1:45:45] War he said why would you to put this
[1:45:47] brother on the front line and so for
[1:45:49] like that it's do that for him
[1:45:51] everything seemed innocent and then the
[1:45:52] brother said yah said how can I be home
[1:45:55] with my
[1:45:56] wife and you Breen out here fighting he
[1:45:59] said not me David
[1:46:02] said so reasoning come
[1:46:05] again find the hottest place of the
[1:46:08] battle is put him there see reasoning
[1:46:12] makes you
[1:46:14] manipulate it makes you manipulate till
[1:46:16] you can get your agenda
[1:46:19] fulfilled
[1:46:21] right then you know the story and then
[1:46:24] David thought he was scot-free
[1:46:27] thank you reasoning you help me out of
[1:46:29] that one I'm good to go but he didn't
[1:46:33] realize there was all I allseeing
[1:46:37] eye was watching
[1:46:41] everything and here come Nathan the
[1:46:43] prophet David
[1:46:46] yes you know the
[1:46:49] story that David start getting hot where
[1:46:51] is the man what who could do something
[1:46:53] like that to the poor little sheep where
[1:46:55] is he he said
[1:46:59] you he thought he got away but God
[1:47:01] caught
[1:47:02] him now go read Psalms
[1:47:08] 51 cuz David wrote that PSAL because of
[1:47:11] what he
[1:47:12] did when he say create in me a clean
[1:47:16] heart that's when David wrote that song
[1:47:19] because he after he got rebuke but if
[1:47:21] you listen to the psalm what David is
[1:47:23] actually saying he's pleading to God he
[1:47:27] said in sin did my mama conceive me
[1:47:30] right why is David saying that how could
[1:47:34] his mama conceive him in sin when it was
[1:47:36] a sinful act when his mama and his
[1:47:38] father was
[1:47:40] married what David is appealing to God
[1:47:43] he's telling God my first
[1:47:48] nature I done this because of this
[1:47:51] nature that is in me this is why I did
[1:47:56] he said God I ain't blaming nobody I
[1:47:57] sinned against you so David laid the
[1:48:00] whole platform to God this is why I did
[1:48:03] it then he said creating
[1:48:06] me a clean heart why did he say that he
[1:48:10] said because I showed you why I did it
[1:48:13] because of this first nature the way
[1:48:15] that I was born and if you don't change
[1:48:17] my heart I'm going to do it again
[1:48:24] that's how you approach
[1:48:25] God God I got a problem and if you don't
[1:48:29] fix me with this problem Lord I'm going
[1:48:30] to do it over and over and over again
[1:48:34] but if you approach God the right way
[1:48:35] God said we going to put a stop to it
[1:48:37] right now I'm going to empower you to
[1:48:40] put a stop to this right
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:45] now
[1:48:49] reason
[1:48:50] praise the
[1:48:54] Lord I tell you I'm reading all of this
[1:48:58] to just get to one
[1:49:00] story and I know you don't heard your
[1:49:03] pastors quote this story over and over
[1:49:06] and over again but I'm going to I'm
[1:49:09] going to quote
[1:49:10] it it's about that
[1:49:13] woman that was on her
[1:49:16] deathbed thinking she was going to
[1:49:18] heaven and she didn't
[1:49:23] you remember the story how many of you
[1:49:24] young people are familiar with that
[1:49:25] story I'm not just preaching to young
[1:49:27] people I'm preaching all of us how many
[1:49:29] you remember this
[1:49:32] story you got to look at the impact of
[1:49:34] that
[1:49:36] story CU At first she was a good
[1:49:40] person the prophet say she was raised up
[1:49:42] right raised in a good family raised in
[1:49:45] a good home all she had all of that in
[1:49:47] the church playing the piano good person
[1:49:51] but one day she moved to a church that
[1:49:54] was a little
[1:49:55] looser than the one that she used to go
[1:50:01] to and where she messed up at going to a
[1:50:04] looser Church watching the way the women
[1:50:06] dressed and see nobody was saying
[1:50:10] nothing she begin to say what's wrong
[1:50:13] with
[1:50:14] it see that's why we as ministers we we
[1:50:18] we call black black white white we just
[1:50:20] preach it all we preach
[1:50:21] revelation we preach Doctrine we rebuke
[1:50:25] we do the whole nine yard we don't keep
[1:50:28] our mouth
[1:50:30] shut cuz when you keep your mouth shut
[1:50:32] on certain things people begin to think
[1:50:34] it's
[1:50:39] okay she ain't nobody saying nothing so
[1:50:41] I guess it's all right because a group
[1:50:44] is going one way that don't mean it's
[1:50:47] right can we say amen God want you and I
[1:50:50] to be able to stand alone not with the
[1:50:53] group that's why Micaiah he didn't let
[1:50:56] them pressure him Mah
[1:51:00] 400 400 Micaiah they are saying the same
[1:51:04] thing why won't you stop trying to be
[1:51:07] different Micaiah just say what
[1:51:09] everybody is saying Mah said nope
[1:51:12] whatever God tell me to say that's what
[1:51:14] I'll say so you can't go by
[1:51:17] groups you got to go by what the word
[1:51:19] say
[1:51:26] if you going to talk about him skipping
[1:51:27] the story when she moved
[1:51:30] away moved to another home the neighbor
[1:51:34] cutting grass she just kept looking over
[1:51:37] there maybe saying hello neighbor hello
[1:51:38] neighbor hello neighbor and then she
[1:51:40] finally W up leaving her husband got
[1:51:42] with the
[1:51:43] neighbor see some sometimes you think
[1:51:45] conversations is so
[1:51:48] innocent but there's a spirit behind
[1:51:51] words if the word of God is spirit and
[1:51:54] truth even the words you speak carries a
[1:51:57] spirit and it just start by
[1:52:04] conversations I'm not calling nobody in
[1:52:06] here
[1:52:08] Slicker but I just want the sisters to
[1:52:10] know how they
[1:52:11] work you might ask yourself a question
[1:52:14] how brother brother how do you know all
[1:52:15] do cuz I used to be
[1:52:18] one when I was in the
[1:52:23] world when you

[1:57:37] what makes him a deceiver he know how to
[1:57:38] blend

[1:58:05] then and and and it feel like we have
[1:58:09] chemistry no no no ain't chemistry
[1:58:11] that's
[1:58:14] lust that's what it is lust and the
[1:58:17] devil is right in the midst of it
[1:58:21] and if you keep continuing that
[1:58:23] route you going to get yourself trapped
[1:58:26] in more and more things it's going to be
[1:58:28] hard to get out
[1:58:30] of I'm just giving you a fair
[1:58:33] warning that's our Spirits
[1:58:41] work can I have a few more
[1:58:45] minutes but I'm then this story here
[1:58:50] but B said so this woman finally fell in
[1:58:53] love with the man the
[1:58:57] neighbor and she left her husband ran
[1:59:00] off married this man continued playing
[1:59:04] the piano in the church and after a
[1:59:07] while she left him marry another one she
[1:59:11] thought she was doing all right and then
[1:59:16] finally ended up as a common law wife he
[1:59:19] said what was it her
[1:59:23] soul told her in the beginning don't do
[1:59:28] that but she
[1:59:33] reasoned that's why I make the statement
[1:59:35] earlier God will always present truth to
[1:59:38] you but he ain't going to make you
[1:59:39] believe it he said her soul told her
[1:59:43] that was
[1:59:44] wrong the reasoning said ain't nothing
[1:59:48] wrong with that
[1:59:51] and as The Story
[1:59:54] Goes he said this is what she begin to
[1:59:56] say now if the rest of the woman can do
[1:59:59] this why can't I do it but down in her
[2:00:02] soul was the spirit said don't do that
[2:00:06] keep away from that that's not right but
[2:00:08] yet she fought against that and cast
[2:00:12] that aside and she went to reasoning
[2:00:15] don't you see don't reason just
[2:00:20] believe believe God's word don't try to
[2:00:23] reason it out just what God Said is the
[2:00:27] truth and believe that to be the truth
[2:00:29] and don't go to your reasonings go to
[2:00:32] your experience to Christ in the heart
[2:00:35] compare it with God's
[2:00:38] word but it gets
[2:00:41] worse this Spirit had trapped her so bad
[2:00:45] till she continued to play the piano in
[2:00:47] church just as religious as she can be
[2:00:50] and it told her there is nothing wrong
[2:00:52] with you and she honestly believe
[2:00:55] it he said now she went on and after a
[2:00:57] while she was called of the pastor of
[2:01:00] the church well this is I'm skipping a
[2:01:01] lot for time sake this is when she was
[2:01:03] on her bed laying on her death bed he
[2:01:06] said now she went on and after a while
[2:01:08] she was called or the pastor of our
[2:01:10] church was called to her bedside to pray
[2:01:13] for her wow she was laying there smoking
[2:01:16] cigarettes and everything Liv in this
[2:01:19] house a come in-law wife and he said
[2:01:22] sister is everything all right with your
[2:01:25] soul to die she said
[2:01:28] everything is at
[2:01:32] peace he said now she believed
[2:01:36] it she had went so long with her
[2:01:40] intellect until she had grieve the Holy
[2:01:44] Spirit from
[2:01:48] her
[2:01:49] if you battling something struggling
[2:01:53] even with the world do I want to step a
[2:01:55] little more farther in the world and
[2:01:56] still being in church if you battling
[2:01:58] with that stop battling with
[2:02:01] it you know it's wrong up front so don't

[2:03:15] showing you how them Spirits work but
[2:03:17] great is he is still here God is still
[2:03:20] here and set you
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:26] free don't grieve the holy spirit away
[2:03:28] from you don't sit in church service
[2:03:31] after service knowing what the preacher
[2:03:33] preaching the truth and keep rejecting
[2:03:34] it I put up offense against it don't
[2:03:37] grieve him
[2:03:38] away don't grieve him away don't grieve
[2:03:41] him receive
[2:03:45] him he says she geve the Holy Spirit
[2:03:48] from
[2:03:49] her it no more spoke to
[2:03:53] her she didn't know which was right she
[2:03:57] had reasoned it out she had a mental
[2:04:00] conception that if she went to church
[2:04:03] and did what was right why she would go
[2:04:05] to heaven that's a mental conception
[2:04:08] well
[2:04:10] reasoning look this is what reasoning do
[2:04:13] sure you're not living right you know
[2:04:16] that but at least you go to church
[2:04:20] that's what reasoning though why do they
[2:04:22] keep messing with you they ought to be
[2:04:23] thankful you in church yeah you living
[2:04:24] wrong but they ought to be thankful you
[2:04:26] in church see you got to block all that
[2:04:29] out reason is just going to keep your
[2:04:32] religion religious but put a block on
[2:04:36] your
[2:04:40] soul he says
[2:04:45] this she had a mental conception that as
[2:04:47] she went to church
[2:04:49] did what was right while she would go to
[2:04:51] heaven that went on down to the very
[2:04:55] hour of her
[2:04:58] death he said but when her reasoning
[2:05:01] power when you die your brain breaks up
[2:05:05] of course when the spirit leaves you and
[2:05:09] then what's left he said here's your
[2:05:13] soul that you neglected back here which
[2:05:17] comes to you then when you're
[2:05:20] dying notice he said your souls come to
[2:05:23] you when you're dying so a reasoning
[2:05:27] spirit is to keep you in bondage till
[2:05:29] you start dying on your deathbed it want
[2:05:32] to keep you
[2:05:35] there are y'all with me am he said and
[2:05:39] this mental reasoning breaks
[2:05:41] up you don't reason no more he said it's
[2:05:45] your soul that's been in your heart that
[2:05:48] you grieved of way then it caught up
[2:05:52] with you and when she did she
[2:05:55] screamed my God I'm lost too late then
[2:06:00] the Soul that had been grieved away see
[2:06:03] when that reasoning telling her that she
[2:06:05] was okay it left her now now her soul
[2:06:07] come up reasoning told her she's okay
[2:06:10] but her soul told her you're
[2:06:13] lost and look how it trapped her just do
[2:06:17] simple
[2:06:19] reasoning but it becomes a power and
[2:06:22] then it gripped
[2:06:27] her when you people leave the
[2:06:33] word most I what I seen when they leave
[2:06:37] the word if they got
[2:06:40] Facebook they start posting their
[2:06:42] pictures on Facebook but how much fun
[2:06:45] they're having
[2:06:47] now
[2:06:49] and if you ain't careful you get on
[2:06:52] Facebook looking at their
[2:06:55] fun you was like
[2:06:58] wow I have never seen them this
[2:07:01] happy not even in
[2:07:04] church but they so happy now they seem
[2:07:07] so free now then reasoning
[2:07:11] come is this
[2:07:14] me devil want to block that off let me
[2:07:16] say it again is this
[2:07:19] message
[2:07:21] right they're having so much fun now
[2:07:26] that's
[2:07:28] reasoning and far as they know I'm
[2:07:32] free I've been set free no I'm I got
[2:07:35] Liberty now and don't realize reasoning
[2:07:38] got them thinking them that got them
[2:07:40] thinking that and they're in
[2:07:46] bundage they try to shoot this woman
[2:07:49] with a hypo shot to make her be quiet
[2:07:52] shoot her with a shot that shot didn't
[2:07:53] even do no good cuz it was too late she
[2:07:56] already seen when she was gone because
[2:07:59] that reasoning have left her that's why
[2:08:01] the prophet warned us and this day about
[2:08:06] reasoning it started in the beginning
[2:08:08] it's powerful and it's still here today
[2:08:12] so never reason against the
[2:08:16] word don't never let reasoning get you
[2:08:19] into a place when you got questions and
[2:08:21] somebody give you an answer and then you
[2:08:24] say did brother Brandon say that or did
[2:08:26] the bible say
[2:08:28] that see what reason is doing now
[2:08:32] saying come on is the Bible or this just
[2:08:35] brother brandom saying
[2:08:38] that let me tell you something whenever
[2:08:41] I preach or any preacher preach if we
[2:08:43] say the prophet said or we say brother
[2:08:45] brandom said what we simply said this is
[2:08:48] what God Said through his
[2:08:54] Prophet this is not brother Brandon's
[2:08:56] message this God's
[2:08:59] message he is the messenger God is
[2:09:06] God you can't separate a messenger from
[2:09:09] his message you can't separate
[2:09:12] it God with so much grace and mercy son
[2:09:17] of prophet in this age for you and me so
[2:09:20] we can see
[2:09:21] everything so we can live a life above
[2:09:24] this world that's what this message come
[2:09:26] to do take us into another kingdom
[2:09:28] another dimension that's what it comes
[2:09:30] to
[2:09:31] do but I know young people there
[2:09:35] struggles and things in this life but
[2:09:39] this is what reasoning don't want you to
[2:09:41] see reasoning don't want you to
[2:09:44] see and this time you get the Holy Ghost
[2:09:48] is a greater victory in my
[2:09:54] day did y'all know that for you to get
[2:09:58] the Holy Ghost in This Day is greater
[2:10:00] than my day because I did not have the
[2:10:02] struggles you got now I didn't have
[2:10:05] internet I didn't have this I had none
[2:10:08] of that but now the whole world has been
[2:10:09] set in front of your
[2:10:11] hand but what the greater power is God
[2:10:14] in your life yet everything can be set
[2:10:16] in your hand but you got something
[2:10:17] inside you you can deny
[2:10:21] it you can deny it that's
[2:10:25] greater how old are you brother Isaac
[2:10:31] 24
[2:10:32] 24 I'm not saying just to lift him up
[2:10:35] but that's a testimony how a young
[2:10:39] person can serve
[2:10:46] God that's an example amen I know a
[2:10:49] couple more young boys 20 young Brothers
[2:10:51] 20 preaching this message to show you
[2:10:55] can serve God in such a time as
[2:10:59] this but
[2:11:01] reasoning oh God I'll get saved one day
[2:11:05] I just I just need to express myself and
[2:11:08] release some things I want to do and my
[2:11:13] life see reasoning makes you think your
[2:11:16] life is yours
[2:11:19] but faith will take you back and tell
[2:11:21] you you've been bought with the
[2:11:23] [Applause]
[2:11:26] price are you with
[2:11:29] meall so young people when you even done
[2:11:31] wrong especially little kids when your
[2:11:33] parent ask you did you do something
[2:11:35] don't
[2:11:40] go crying ain't the answer they ask you
[2:11:43] a
[2:11:44] question see the crying is to throw your
[2:11:47] parents off
[2:11:49] I'm not one of the ones to be thrown off
[2:11:51] I let you
[2:11:52] cry when you finish crying I ask you the
[2:11:55] same question did you do
[2:11:59] it reasoning it teaches you to
[2:12:03] manipulate but yet it's trapping your
[2:12:07] soul it's a power don't play with
[2:12:14] it and it uses
[2:12:17] scripture
[2:12:20] I seen young boys God touch them young
[2:12:24] girls God touch them and their lives
[2:12:26] they really want to start off on the
[2:12:28] right track and then the devil just
[2:12:30] bring all kind of stuff in their
[2:12:32] life throw them
[2:12:34] off girl decides she want to serve the
[2:12:37] Lord a boy that she was like and never
[2:12:40] paid no attention to her then all of a
[2:12:42] sudden now she want to serve the Lord
[2:12:44] and he pops
[2:12:46] up and she ain't careful
[2:12:52] Lord you said
[2:12:54] it seek you first the kingdom of God and
[2:12:57] his
[2:12:58] righteousness and I did it and you told
[2:13:01] me you were
[2:13:03] add to my life you told me that now you
[2:13:07] done brought
[2:13:08] him I see it in your word you done
[2:13:10] brought him I'm sorry he
[2:13:13] didn't God didn't bring
[2:13:16] it God didn't bring it
[2:13:18] the devil
[2:13:20] did to throw you
[2:13:24] off that's why when you start God start
[2:13:27] really dealing with you you see all
[2:13:28] stuff kind of start popping up what you
[2:13:30] need to do is start
[2:13:32] smiling Satan Satan Satan you don't
[2:13:36] think I can see you
[2:13:38] buddy you just not you think I'm that
[2:13:41] dumb what I don't been through with you
[2:13:43] you think I can't see you now no Satan I
[2:13:46] rebuke you right now I'm going on all
[2:13:48] the
[2:13:50] way going
[2:13:52] [Applause]
[2:13:56] all because you
[2:13:58] failed and been a
[2:14:00] failure that don't mean that's the
[2:14:05] end that don't mean it's the end but
[2:14:08] when you realize that you failed and
[2:14:10] been a failure that's our opening that
[2:14:12] means you can be
[2:14:14] helped cuz you now see your condition
[2:14:17] say wait a minute I don't have to stay
[2:14:19] down here I can come out of this because
[2:14:22] it's God's grace and mercy to even
[2:14:25] preach to you this
[2:14:27] way to let you know you can come back
[2:14:29] cuz he's a restoring God this is
[2:14:32] restoration the Bible said Ministry God
[2:14:35] has given us a Ministry of
[2:14:37] reconciliation to bring you
[2:14:40] back if you sitting here in that shake
[2:14:43] tonight God trying to bring you
[2:14:46] back
[2:14:49] amen can I say one more
[2:14:52] thing some of you probably don't heard
[2:14:54] me preach this but I I got to say it
[2:14:57] anyway it's about
[2:15:01] Rahab you can't get no
[2:15:04] lore in the life that Rahab
[2:15:09] lived it took a prophet to even
[2:15:13] explain why she was a
[2:15:16] prostitute we wouldn't never figured it
[2:15:19] out he said the parents put her out
[2:15:21] there for
[2:15:24] income I would have never figured that
[2:15:28] out but look at this woman even though
[2:15:31] she was put out there by her father and
[2:15:34] prostitution she still loved
[2:15:37] him she still loved him that's why she
[2:15:41] wouldn't got all her family come on get
[2:15:42] up under this toe CU she still loved
[2:15:46] them she's a
[2:15:49] harlot and then God going to put the
[2:15:53] Earthly
[2:15:54] lineage of Jesus
[2:15:57] Christ and a
[2:16:00] harlot from
[2:16:03] Rahab man from Rahab Simone comes
[2:16:09] Boaz from Boaz come
[2:16:12] Jesse from Jesse comes David from David
[2:16:16] comes Solomon on down and on down all
[2:16:19] the way up to Christ and he brought the
[2:16:21] lineage and put a a prostitute name
[2:16:24] there Rahab but you know when you look
[2:16:26] at the lineage of Christ you never see
[2:16:28] Beth Sheba name
[2:16:30] there it'll say that woman that's right
[2:16:34] because of the adulterous act God can't
[2:16:36] stand
[2:16:37] that but he used Rahab to let you and me
[2:16:40] know you can go down to the lowest and
[2:16:43] the lowest of life but still royalty can
[2:16:46] come out of it
[2:16:55] my
[2:16:58] goodness I love that story of
[2:17:01] Rahab think about
[2:17:04] it when the wall of Jericho went
[2:17:09] down here stands her cuz Joshua told his
[2:17:12] service go get her like you promised go
[2:17:15] get her here goes Rahab
[2:17:18] her and her family standing on the
[2:17:20] outside of
[2:17:22] Jericho I can see them what are we going
[2:17:24] to do now Jericho destroyed we we got no
[2:17:27] home what are we going to do
[2:17:29] now but she didn't know God had a
[2:17:33] plan see the mystery in rahab's
[2:17:36] life if she knew God was a delivering
[2:17:41] God she told the the spies we
[2:17:46] heard what y'all
[2:17:49] toing she said we heard what y'all done
[2:17:51] to this King done to this King she heard
[2:17:53] the mighty works of God there's no doubt
[2:17:56] she said if a God can subdue
[2:18:00] kingdoms all
[2:18:04] kingdoms what about this one let me have
[2:18:11] it if God can subdue kingdoms and they
[2:18:14] can be
[2:18:16] destroyed what could this God do for
[2:18:22] me what can this God do for me she
[2:18:25] looking at all of that all of the men's
[2:18:27] trembling she wasn't trembling she said
[2:18:30] I want this
[2:18:32] God and then the walls come
[2:18:36] down there go her and her
[2:18:40] family but she didn't
[2:18:42] realize God just didn't give her any man
[2:18:46] she gave him some on
[2:18:49] the
[2:18:50] captain of the Israelite
[2:18:52] Army from a
[2:18:55] harlot to marrying a captain of the
[2:18:58] Israelite
[2:19:00] Army did y'all y'all knew that but look
[2:19:03] at the
[2:19:04] story you're not going to tell me many
[2:19:06] women did not want
[2:19:08] Simone I know they wanted him cuz he's
[2:19:10] the
[2:19:11] captain but the Harlot got
[2:19:16] him
[2:19:19] the Harlot got
[2:19:21] him I can see
[2:19:25] aab now she got to come around Israel
[2:19:27] you know in the Bible when they go to
[2:19:29] the well that's why the woman at the
[2:19:31] well was there by herself with Jesus
[2:19:33] because of the life she lived she
[2:19:35] couldn't go around over the virgins
[2:19:37] drawing water she couldn't be there
[2:19:39] around them cuz they would look that
[2:19:42] like
[2:19:46] dirt
[2:19:48] I can just imagine all of the
[2:19:50] gossip when the war was
[2:19:53] over the Israelites what a victory what
[2:19:57] a victory but somebody say you know I
[2:20:01] heard that when the spies went over
[2:20:04] there they went into a harlot's house I
[2:20:07] heard that too
[2:20:09] girl I heard that to harlot's house out
[2:20:14] of all the places they could go went to
[2:20:16] harlot's house M you know Harlot that
[2:20:18] ain't
[2:20:21] good I can see some
[2:20:24] on just I'm just
[2:20:26] dramatizing to overhear that
[2:20:29] conversation did y did y'all
[2:20:31] say My boys that was a harlot house they
[2:20:34] went in they said yeah yeah Harlot
[2:20:38] Simone said you Ain happen to know her
[2:20:41] name would
[2:20:42] you I
[2:20:45] said I think it's Rahab he said right
[2:20:48] okay thank you I can see Simone
[2:20:53] wow what a
[2:20:57] woman she gave her
[2:21:00] life to protect my
[2:21:03] soldiers if that kind of woman can give
[2:21:06] her life for the
[2:21:08] gospel what kind of
[2:21:11] wife will she make
[2:21:14] me Harlot didn't even come in his mind
[2:21:17] cuz he didn't care about that he was
[2:21:19] looking at the
[2:21:22] character see when you willing to die
[2:21:24] for this
[2:21:26] gospel God always gives you something
[2:21:32] back oh my if RAB would have went to the
[2:21:36] wh she couldn't go where the sisters was
[2:21:38] there she couldn't they would have ran
[2:21:40] off she had to go when they
[2:21:43] leave you know that's
[2:21:46] true yeah sisters at the well dip in the
[2:21:49] water then RAB
[2:21:51] come and we see how God engineered that
[2:21:55] so perfectly cuz there had to be some
[2:21:57] kind of way for Simone and Rahab to
[2:22:00] meet had to be and God was in the all of
[2:22:03] that he was in all of it orchestrating
[2:22:07] it and then when he meet this Rahab I
[2:22:10] can see
[2:22:12] Simone finally meets her say I
[2:22:15] understand your name is Rahab
[2:22:17] and her reasoning kicks
[2:22:20] in yeah this man know about my life now
[2:22:24] he's going to tell me and my family we
[2:22:26] don't need to be around him we're too
[2:22:29] dirty then she said yeah I'm Rahab some
[2:22:33] on like wow you RAB
[2:22:38] sh that's
[2:22:40] me and I can just see
[2:22:43] someone can I ask you a
[2:22:45] question she said what is
[2:22:47] it will you marry
[2:22:52] me hallu
[2:22:54] RAB what did you
[2:22:56] say will you marry
[2:22:59] me she said but you don't know who I am
[2:23:01] he said I didn't ask you that she she
[2:23:04] said you don't know what I did he said I
[2:23:05] didn't even ask you that I just got a
[2:23:07] question will you marry me re said but
[2:23:11] you don't know my past he said but I
[2:23:14] know a
[2:23:16] future I know a future I can bring you
[2:23:19] to if you just say the magic word I
[2:23:25] do now can you see
[2:23:27] Rahab now walking with the
[2:23:31] captain of the Israelite Army and people
[2:23:35] had to respect her
[2:23:38] now here goes
[2:23:42] Rahab walking with her
[2:23:45] husband s sister's gossiping look at
[2:23:48] some on look at it you know what she did
[2:23:51] she did she did that and then RAB say
[2:23:53] honey uh excuse me a minute she he said
[2:23:55] what is she said I I want to talk to the
[2:23:57] sisters for a minute he said go ahead
[2:23:59] she go over there said sisters uh I
[2:24:03] heard y'all talking about me they no no
[2:24:05] no no she no no no no I heard
[2:24:07] you she said but I just want to ask
[2:24:09] y'all
[2:24:11] something everything that you're saying
[2:24:13] about
[2:24:14] me can you prove what I did
[2:24:18] they said why we heard she said I don't
[2:24:20] care what you heard can you prove what I
[2:24:25] did cuz when God destroyed
[2:24:32] Jericho he wiped her paths
[2:24:36] away that's the God we serve and the
