[0:00] but I like that she said you know Satan
[0:03] tries to put all these things in front
[0:04] of us that are all lying vanities that
[0:06] we he wants us to chase after which all
[0:08] would just pass away but but see yeah
[0:10] something that's the Word of God eternal
[0:13] things are the only things that are
[0:14] really worth ultimately worthwhile and
[0:17] that's the Word of God and and souls in
[0:19] life
[0:19] you know that's what's worthwhile but it
[0:21] was just straight moving she said that
[0:22] Satan puts all these liabilities in our
[0:25] path to kind of follow me follow me do
[0:27] this come here do this do this and
[0:28] they're actually all lying entities they
[0:29] all you know we we have to do these
[0:32] things but they all pass away there's a
[0:34] song it says build your hopes on things
[0:35] eternal and and as I was thinking about
[0:37] the thought you know she said you know
[0:40] reading the Word of God is actually
[0:41] eternal that there's something you can
[0:43] do that's eternal of eternal value
[0:45] things that we would overlook and Satan
[0:47] says no there's nothing in that but
[0:48] actually that's where eternity lies you
[0:51] know and and and just getting into the
[0:53] Spirit of God being in his presence is
[0:55] actually eternity and that's that's
[0:57] something of value may we always press
[1:00] into that and may our lives just be
[1:01] continually refreshed by the Spirit of
[1:04] God that's when that's when everything
[1:07] is okay even when it's not let some

[25:16] to read down to verse 14
[25:24] it's great to have brother Andrew with
[25:27] us god bless you amen
[25:31] see and it came to pass when the Lord
[25:34] would take up Elijah into heaven by a
[25:37] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah
[25:39] from Gilgal and Elijah said unto Elijah
[25:42] tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has
[25:44] sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto
[25:47] him as the Lord loveth and as thy soul
[25:48] liveth I'll not leave thee so they went
[25:51] down to Bethel and the sons of the
[25:53] prophets that were a Bethel came forth
[25:55] to Elisha and said unto Him knowest thou
[25:57] that the Lord will take away thy master
[25:59] from by heed today he said yeah I know
[26:02] it hold ye your peace and Elisha sodon't
[26:06] unto Him Elisha tarry here I pray thee
[26:08] for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and
[26:10] he said as the Lord loveth and as thy
[26:12] soul liveth I'll not leave thee so they
[26:14] came to Jericho and the sons of the
[26:16] prophets there at Jericho came to Elisha
[26:19] and said unto Him knowest thou the Lord
[26:21] will take away thy master from my head
[26:23] today and he answered yea I know it hold
[26:25] ye your peace and Elisha said unto him
[26:28] Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has
[26:30] sent me to Jordan and he said as the
[26:32] Lord love and the liveth and as my soul
[26:34] loveth I'll not leave thee and they too
[26:37] went on and fifty men of the sons of the
[26:40] prophets went and stood to view afar off
[26:42] and they too stood by Jordan and Elijah
[26:45] took his mantle unwrapped it together
[26:47] and smote the waters and they were
[26:49] divided hither and thither ather so that
[26:52] they too went down over on dry ground
[26:55] and it came to pass when they were gone
[26:58] over the light just said unto Elijah ask
[27:00] what I shall do for thee before I be
[27:04] taken away from the inn Elijah said I
[27:06] pray thee let a double portion of my
[27:08] spirit be upon me and he said thou has
[27:10] asked a hard thing give less if thou see
[27:13] me when I am taken from thee it shall be
[27:16] be so unto thee but if not it shall not
[27:20] be so they came to pass as they still
[27:22] went on and talked that behold there
[27:24] appeared a chariot of fire and horses of
[27:26] fire and depart imparted them asunder
[27:29] and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[27:31] heaven and Elisha saw and he cried my
[27:34] father my father charit of Israel and
[27:36] the horsemen there off and he saw him no
[27:38] more
[27:38] took hold of his own clothes and written
[27:40] them into pieces he took up also the
[27:42] mantle of Elijah that fell upon him
[27:44] uhsorry fell from him and went back and
[27:47] stood by the Bank of Jordan and he took
[27:49] the mantle of Elijah that fell from him
[27:51] and smote the waters and see it where is
[27:53] the go Lord God of Elijah and when he
[27:55] also had spent in the waters they parted
[27:57] hither and thither there's a and Elijah
[28:00] went over a me and made Lord blesses
[28:02] word you may have your seats tonight I
[28:09] want to continue on our series on the
[28:13] lady AOC in church age and you know the
[28:16] second part of revelations chapter 10
[28:19] it's it's our portion of Scripture where
[28:21] John is commanded to take the book from
[28:23] the angel and eat the book and prophesy
[28:25] again and so it shows there is a
[28:27] continuation of a ministry from where it
[28:30] was once a a one-man ministry of a
[28:32] prophet now it's a ministry in a
[28:34] multi-member body so we I trust you have
[28:37] realized that you're part of that
[28:38] ministry it's not just a preaching
[28:40] ministry or fivefold ministry of
[28:43] ministry but it's a you know of
[28:45] preaching but it's also every part of
[28:47] the body is part of that ministry I mean
[28:50] a helper of government a a musician a
[28:52] song leader a a sunday-school teacher
[28:54] mom or a dad or you know every every
[28:57] part of the body functions in this
[28:59] ministry amen now Elijah here if you
[29:05] want to turn back to first Kings 19 he
[29:09] is commanded by God to go and and do
[29:13] certain things and one of them is to
[29:15] call Elisha now in the story here I'm
[29:18] going to use Elijah as a type of Christ
[29:20] and Elisha is the church so you only who
[29:23] I'm talking about I'm talking about the
[29:24] Lord and you and ultimately you got to
[29:27] follow the Lord all the way from gilgul
[29:28] across Jordan and receive a double
[29:30] portion of us earth that's when you can
[29:32] really be put into the ministry but we
[29:35] see here in 1st Kings 19 that God tells
[29:38] God tells Elisha and we'll go and we'll
[29:44] go from verse 16 sorry of first Kings 19
[29:48] and all go from verse 15
[29:52] and the Lord said unto him go return on
[29:56] my way to the wilderness of Damascus and
[29:59] and when thou comest anoint has your to
[30:01] be king of Assyria and jehu the son of
[30:05] nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
[30:08] Israel and elisha the son of shaphat of
[30:12] Abell abel mahalia shalt thou anoint to
[30:16] be prophet in my room and it shall come
[30:18] to pass that he that escaped at the
[30:19] sword of has you'll show J who slay and
[30:22] him that escaped earth from the sword of
[30:23] Jehu shall Elisha Slade yet I have left
[30:26] me 7,000 and Israel all the knees which
[30:29] have not bowed unto Bale and every mouth
[30:32] which hath not kissed him so he departed
[30:34] thence and found elisha the son of
[30:36] shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke
[30:39] of oxen before him and he was with the
[30:41] twelfth and elijah passed by and cast
[30:44] his mantle upon him and he left the oxen
[30:47] I ran after Elijah and said let me I
[30:49] pray thee kiss my father and my mother
[30:51] and then I will follow thee and he said
[30:54] unto Him go back again for what I for
[30:57] what have I done to thee and he returned
[31:00] back from him and he took a yoke of oxen
[31:03] and slew them and bawled their flesh
[31:04] with the instruments the oxen and gave
[31:06] unto the people and they did eat then he
[31:09] arose and he went after Elijah and he
[31:11] ministered unto him so their head so
[31:14] they came a time where where where
[31:16] Elijah threw his mantle his prophets
[31:18] mantle upon Elijah but it didn't fit him
[31:21] yet he had to go through a he had to go
[31:23] through a discipleship with Elijah in
[31:25] the camus season where the mantle would
[31:27] fit him but you see he was so this
[31:30] mantle as as the Holy Ghost we're gonna
[31:33] have church tonight are we all awake are
[31:36] we all here Amen so like so what I
[31:40] really want to get out tonight is you
[31:41] know Christianity is not learning things
[31:44] it's not a feel theoretical
[31:47] understanding or just some doctrine but
[31:49] it's a life that it's expressed in you
[31:52] it means it must be the life of Christ
[31:54] has to anoint you and dwell in you and
[31:58] then you are part of his ministry in
[32:00] this end time right it's not just it's
[32:02] not just you know people can turn the
[32:04] message into like the Apostles
[32:06] creet say a creative beliefs and then
[32:08] you're a believer you know but it's more
[32:10] you know it's more just saying some
[32:11] words it's a life that must be lived
[32:14] it's a life that must be expressed and
[32:16] so Elijah was called to be the Prophet
[32:19] sorry Elijah was called to be the
[32:22] prophet after Elijah he would continue
[32:25] on Elijah's ministry and just as just as
[32:28] Elijah was call to continue Elijah's
[32:30] ministry so the Bride of Christ is upon
[32:33] the earth to continue the ministry of
[32:35] Malachi for amen because there has to be
[32:38] a living witness of the resurrected Lord
[32:41] Jesus and every generation the Prophet
[32:44] has gone off the earth he's not going to
[32:45] return and preach some more he's not
[32:47] going to heal the sick raise the dead
[32:49] he's not going to you know he's going to
[32:51] be raised to manifest the life of Christ
[32:53] of the earth amen his power minister
[32:56] he's done right he's been taken off the
[32:59] earth now a bride has to come to her
[33:01] position and Elijah Elijah couldn't come
[33:04] to his position when Elijah was there he
[33:07] had to be taken out of the way then that
[33:09] same anointing that was upon Elijah fell
[33:12] upon Elijah for a double portion of it
[33:14] because Elijah to-date miracles Elijah
[33:16] did for right but it was the same life
[33:18] was the same anointing that was on
[33:20] Elijah fell upon Elijah and when it fell
[33:23] upon Elijah then he could do the
[33:25] ministry he was called to do okay this
[33:28] is where I'm going that's basically my
[33:29] summary now we're going to catch up to
[33:31] it just so you know where we're going
[33:33] okay so now so a lie so Elijah he was
[33:39] already you know he had basically he
[33:42] burned every Bridge he killed the oxen
[33:45] you know he he had nothing to return
[33:48] back to and has to be the same thing you
[33:50] got to make up your mind I'm going
[33:51] through Jesus I'm going all the way I'm
[33:54] not just here for a Sunday picnic or be
[33:56] a part-time Christian I'm walking with
[33:58] you all the way I'm not just going to
[34:00] start I'm going to finish I'm not going
[34:03] to stop my race I'm going to finish the
[34:05] race I'm going to cross that finish line
[34:06] I don't just want to start and get
[34:08] stitched and pull off to the side and
[34:10] you know I'm going to continue with the
[34:12] stitch hallelujah I'm going to continue
[34:14] on and so Elijah was determined he was
[34:18] determined to follow him all the
[34:20] right and then so finally they came a
[34:22] time when there was a transition period
[34:24] where now Elijah had to come into his
[34:28] position and it has to be and we're
[34:30] living in that day amen
[34:33] as I said we're not brother branham will
[34:35] return with the resurrected Saints but
[34:37] it's all over then amen but he's not
[34:40] returning to preach right
[34:42] we can't just play tapes this gospel
[34:45] must be lived in every generation
[34:47] the Apostle Paul didn't tell them just
[34:49] write out my letters and send them
[34:51] though those letters had to put on flesh
[34:53] and a people and then the ministry had
[34:56] to preach the word right brother Browns
[34:58] asked a question does the bride does the
[35:01] bride have a ministry in the end time
[35:03] and he says very simply yes it does
[35:09] so here's a question would the Bride of
[35:11] Christ would the Bride of Christ have a
[35:13] ministry before the rapture II says sure
[35:15] it's going on right now see the Bride of
[35:18] Christ certainly is the message of the
[35:20] hour see the Bride of Christ she
[35:21] consists of apostles prophets teachers
[35:24] evangelists and pastors is that right
[35:26] congregation says they mean there's the
[35:28] Bride of Christ sure she's got a
[35:30] ministry great ministry the ministry of
[35:32] the hour says it'll be so humble so the
[35:35] bride has a ministry and I'll say this
[35:37] if you're not a fivefold ministry member
[35:40] you're not just here to prop up a
[35:42] ministry right you have part of the
[35:45] ministry yourself amen you say well I
[35:48] can't sing I can't do it you can create
[35:50] an atmosphere I mean you and create an
[35:52] atmosphere and worship their God comes
[35:54] down I mean you can create an atmosphere
[35:56] and God comes down and breaks the yoke
[35:58] off someone sets them free
[35:59] I mean changes the whole order of a
[36:02] service maybe it's you know kind of just
[36:04] wafting around then you say all on faith
[36:07] pulls them down and God moves I mean
[36:10] you're not just here to prop up some
[36:12] ministry you're part of the ministry we
[36:13] all need one another
[36:14] we're as important as one another
[36:16] there's no big use and little Me's or
[36:19] other way around
[36:20] amen hallelujah I'm glad we can all put
[36:23] our shoulders to the wheel Saint Lord
[36:25] let's get across that finish line let's
[36:27] get the job done
[36:30] amen so we have a ministry at the same
[36:33] time
[36:33] now elijah follows the larger all the
[36:38] way he he doesn't just start start but
[36:44] he follows them all the way across
[36:45] Jordan they noticed us they start and
[36:48] it's the same with with every Christian
[36:50] journey you know we don't just we don't
[36:54] just repent and stay there right we
[36:57] don't just accept them as as our Lord
[36:59] and Savior and stay there you got to
[37:00] keep walking that's the beginning first
[37:03] you must believe he is entering water of
[37:06] him that diligently seek them right seat
[37:08] so you start off with that but then
[37:10] European to me baptize them the Lord
[37:12] Jesus Christ you're showing this world
[37:14] in the next world
[37:15] who you're being United with right but
[37:18] you don't just stay there it's a
[37:21] glorious thing to repent it's a glorious
[37:23] Center get baptized beyond just stay
[37:24] there we're to go all the way right and
[37:27] then so we start there with justified so
[37:30] we we can start at Gilgal just like
[37:33] Elijah with was with a larger Gilgal but
[37:36] Elijah was determined something in him
[37:38] said that that that that that road that
[37:42] that fell upon me that made me walk with
[37:45] you it's it's mine to wear later right
[37:49] you may feel a little tug on your heart
[37:51] that's the mantle coming upon you to try
[37:54] and call your to get your attention
[37:56] you know God just doesn't want to walk
[37:58] with you wants to be in you I mean he
[38:00] doesn't want you to have someone else's
[38:02] testimony he wants you to have your own
[38:04] testimony he wants God he wants to live
[38:06] in you that's why he died on Calvary
[38:09] heaven is my throne earth is my
[38:11] footstool where is the place of my rest
[38:12] he asked in Isaiah and you should be
[38:14] able to say Here I am Here I am Lord on
[38:17] the place of your rest Here I am
[38:20] Kolia thank God is wanting appeal so
[38:23] here I am just like I was there in the
[38:26] temple Here I am Lord send me right so
[38:29] we're the place of his rest
[38:31] amen but you see he didn't stay it he
[38:34] you know he didn't stay there at Gilgal
[38:35] but then they went to Bethel just like
[38:38] you start you know you're justified by
[38:41] faith you're baptized in his name I mean
[38:43] you know you're identified in baptism
[38:45] but then you must go and be cleansed
[38:48] amen you must go be cleansed so you go
[38:51] to go to Bethel you have another
[38:52] experience where God cleanses you takes
[38:54] the desire out of your life I mean for
[38:57] the city you know you know if the sins
[38:58] of the world and you know you know
[39:00] sanctify you cleanse you sit us sit your
[39:03] side for service and that's a glorious
[39:05] thing it's a glorious thing for when you
[39:08] were once a slave to the sins of the
[39:10] world now you're free
[39:12] I mean he whom the Sun sets free is free
[39:15] indeed holy you went a little bit free
[39:18] we're not we don't have a bracelet thing
[39:21] on our ankle and when we walk out the
[39:23] house the alarm goes off and the police
[39:24] come I mean we're really free right
[39:28] we're not on home detention we were not
[39:30] at least we're not in prison I mean all
[39:32] you were at home but we're still asleep
[39:33] we're not that way we're really free
[39:35] amen he whom the son sets free is free
[39:38] indeed
[39:39] and he says you shall know the truth and
[39:41] the truth shall make you free there's a
[39:44] power and the truth to make you free
[39:46] that's why it's not our power trying to
[39:49] make us free there's a power in the
[39:50] truth of this business that will make
[39:52] you free hallelujah I'm glad is a power
[39:55] stronger than me that can set me free
[39:58] amen just like we're having glorious
[40:01] fellowship last night about Simon of
[40:03] Cyrene Jesus carrying the cross up
[40:05] Calvary and he and he can't carry it
[40:08] anymore because he's bleeding he's
[40:09] wounded he's mad beyond any man but
[40:11] there's another man there who's stronger
[40:12] that can carry the burden that he can
[40:15] finish his ministry right as the same
[40:17] thing we make it under a big weight but
[40:20] there's someone stronger than us you
[40:22] follow one say he is the Lord Jesus it's
[40:25] not just a Gentile watching in the crowd
[40:27] but he himself comes I'll help you be
[40:30] your burden that you can finish your
[40:31] ministry amen
[40:34] God carries us you know us little
[40:37] children like carry me just pick them up
[40:38] off we go holy he just picks us up off
[40:42] we go
[40:42] amen but they came out okay no see he
[40:48] came to they came to Bethel and it's
[40:51] glorious to be sanctified but he didn't
[40:53] stay there and it's it's interesting
[40:56] because even the Prophet the the the
[40:59] school of the prophets they knew that
[41:01] Allah
[41:01] was going in a rapture so so they knew
[41:05] all this was going on but they weren't
[41:06] part of they weren't part of it because
[41:08] Elijah was one that was part of Elijah
[41:10] being carried up okay and then they come
[41:14] to Jericho and then they go to Jordan
[41:17] now Jordan represents death and you see
[41:21] as only those two that went to only
[41:23] those two that went to Jordan
[41:25] now Elijah had the power to part death
[41:29] that they could walk across so his
[41:31] ministry enabled them to part death so
[41:34] they could walk across
[41:36] Alleluia he had that mantle he smoked
[41:39] the he smoked the river amen in the and
[41:42] the waters parted death parted they
[41:44] could walk through death to the other
[41:46] side and then there came the point now
[41:49] so Elijah is where he wanted to be in
[41:52] the very beginning it's wonderful to be
[41:55] at Gilgal Bethel is a wonderful place
[41:58] Jericho can be nice too you got across
[42:00] Jordan you got across Jordan you can't
[42:03] stand those other places they may even
[42:05] look at you know you got to go all the
[42:07] way you don't follow this word all the
[42:10] way gotta follow the Lord Jesus he
[42:12] doesn't want young Gilgal or in Bethel
[42:15] only he doesn't want you in the start he
[42:16] wants you at the end right and then so
[42:19] now here he comes he says give me a
[42:23] double portion of your spirit he says if
[42:25] when you see me go you know if you see
[42:27] me go then you know then you shall
[42:30] receive it and then he saw him go they
[42:32] were parted in that same mantle that
[42:34] wasn't Elijah now fell to the ground and
[42:36] Elijah picked it up and you see what he
[42:39] does does he goes back to that same
[42:42] Jordan and he wants to see now this
[42:44] ministry that I've received cannot part
[42:46] death that people could walk over and he
[42:49] says where is the god of Elijah he
[42:52] smites the Jordan Amen if he's really
[42:55] the same God prove yourself that you're
[42:57] still the same if that's a bit bold I
[42:59] don't know but he's saying you know
[43:00] where are you where is the god of Elijah
[43:03] because otherwise that do no good to
[43:05] walk all that way and follow him for all
[43:07] those years and then it just comes to a
[43:09] well Elijah to this and Elijah to this
[43:11] and brother Bram did this and this was
[43:13] this testimony
[43:14] there's no testimony today right there's
[43:17] going to be a living witness we are a
[43:19] living witness I mean the bride is a
[43:22] living witness more than an argument
[43:24] more than a debate but a life this one
[43:27] has to be a life in you right because
[43:30] God will have a voice in this last day
[43:32] and it's a lived voice brother brems
[43:35] here's what we need in jeffersonville a
[43:37] Menace thousands of lives voices that is
[43:40] the thunder that shakes the devil as the
[43:43] same thing I'll just trade
[43:44] jeffersonville for Wellington or
[43:45] wherever we're from that's what God
[43:47] needs has lived voices I mean because
[43:50] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[43:51] and so he receives that mantle and men
[43:55] he smites thee he smites the you know
[43:58] the River Jordan and aparts and he walks
[44:00] over it and there has to be the same
[44:02] thing with us we're going to have a
[44:04] ministry they can part death that people
[44:07] could walk through more than just
[44:10] healing more than just prophecy right
[44:13] more than just speaking in tongues all
[44:15] those things are wonderful but a
[44:16] ministry that parts did that a people
[44:18] can walk over to a different land right
[44:21] there are people can really see the life
[44:23] of God and they more than an anointing
[44:25] but God's abiding presence in the soul
[44:28] hallelujah and I'm so glad we have that
[44:31] Amen that the waters can part we can
[44:34] walk over walk over into a new land a
[44:37] new way of life hallelujah but then he
[44:42] comes back now and they you see but
[44:45] these proper these students of the
[44:47] schools of the prophets they didn't
[44:49] believe that Elijah had gone and they go
[44:52] looking for him and they can't find him
[44:54] but now Elijah starts in his ministry
[44:57] and he continues on he continues on from
[45:01] where we are Elijah lifts off now here
[45:06] we are this is where we are right we the
[45:09] same life that was an Elijah as now the
[45:12] same life that was in Christ is now in
[45:14] you right just like just like with the
[45:17] Book of X H the same life that was in
[45:19] Jesus came into 120 and his ministry
[45:22] continued on and his ministry is still
[45:24] continuing on amen and that's
[45:28] what God wants he doesn't just want us
[45:30] to hang around him he doesn't just want
[45:32] us to be part of the school of the
[45:33] prophets he's not interested in us
[45:35] learning some kind of religion there's a
[45:39] lot of schools of the prophets today and
[45:41] people learn how to be prophets you
[45:43] don't learn to be a prophet you're born
[45:45] the gift and calling it God is there a
[45:47] vocable right it's already there you
[45:51] can't learn to be a prophet God takes
[45:53] you and places you in an office just
[45:55] like you can't learn to be the bright
[45:57] God makes you the bride because you
[45:59] always were the bride just like David's
[46:01] there he's looking after his father's
[46:03] sheep and when Samuel goes to Jesse's
[46:06] house Jesse doesn't call David he's not
[46:09] even it's not even in not even in his
[46:12] father's mind that David may be included
[46:14] and then and then Jesse brings his sons
[46:17] one by one brings him in front of Samuel
[46:20] Samuel sees the first one he thinks this
[46:22] one must be the Kings big tall he looks
[46:24] like a king God says no I've refused him
[46:25] and then Samuel sees what about the next
[46:28] one next one comes in next one next one
[46:30] next one this is do you have any more I
[46:33] think Jesse says I actually do he's not
[46:37] here we'll go get him so the unlikely
[46:39] one was the one hallelujah the unlikely
[46:43] one was the one and then so he comes he
[46:45] comes David because God Rory told Samuel
[46:48] in Jesse's house I have my future King
[46:50] he's already there and he comes this
[46:53] little boy I don't know skipping along I
[46:55] know what he is doing but here he was
[46:56] God sees my king that's him he's sure
[47:00] that's him God don't make any mistakes
[47:03] right and then he and then gets anointed
[47:06] by that vindicated prophet that prop
[47:08] that anointing was emptied out upon that
[47:11] vessel and that brought that kingship to
[47:13] life and then from that moment he began
[47:15] to walk just like Elijah was walking
[47:17] with Elijah he was walking with that
[47:19] anointing because the word says that the
[47:21] Spirit of God was with David from that
[47:23] day on so he begins to walk and God
[47:26] begins to teach him well was his first
[47:28] lesson he comes a lion that's his first
[47:30] lesson and it and he kills the lion and
[47:33] then here comes the bear he thinks well
[47:35] I killed a line I can kill a bear so he
[47:36] kills a bear
[47:37] he gets victory over that and then here
[47:39] comes here comes a Goliath and this is
[47:42] two
[47:42] King Saul well I killed the line I
[47:44] killed the bed this one will be the same
[47:45] as then doesn't matter how the devil
[47:47] dress himself uh but still the devil
[47:49] amen he still defeated our Lord Jesus
[47:51] defeated him on Calvary so what this one
[47:54] comes against me I'll kill it I'll kill
[47:55] that one I'll kill this one amen if one
[47:57] chase one can chase a thousand I can I'm
[48:00] not going to spend time counting for a
[48:01] thousand I'll just kill them all
[48:02] I mean sham girl wasn't worried or how
[48:05] many are they cannot do it no he just he
[48:07] just went with his ox code jumped out
[48:09] brother man said jumped out the window
[48:10] charged it then because he was a
[48:12] circumcised son of Abraham and that was
[48:15] enough the Prophet says Amen if you're
[48:18] the Bride of Christ that's enough
[48:20] hallelujah just take what you have and
[48:22] go you say but it's awful small weapon
[48:25] that rock down to giant hallelujah one
[48:30] Rock and also David staying there he's
[48:33] looking at this giant and he says today
[48:35] I'm going to cut your head off and he's
[48:37] got a staff and he's got a sling and he
[48:39] doesn't have a sword and his wife making
[48:42] his boast and the very thing that's
[48:43] going to take his head from his
[48:44] shoulders he's carrying hallelujah and
[48:48] the devil you know ultimately the devil
[48:50] just looks like a fool amen but God
[48:54] allow such things to happen because God
[48:56] wants to prove his salvation to you
[48:57] that's why we don't need to worry right
[49:00] we don't need to worry
[49:01] I mean God is proving his word in your
[49:04] life when the enemy comes in like a
[49:06] flood or raise up a standard that's the
[49:09] anointing in you Alleluia
[49:11] so now David David yo he just follows
[49:14] just like Elijah was following and he
[49:17] follows that prophecy that he was going
[49:18] to be king he was so he was so dead sure
[49:21] it was a revelation to him faith is not
[49:25] a hope so faith as I know it right
[49:29] there's a big difference between hoping
[49:30] it'll happen and knowing it'll happen if
[49:33] you know it's going to happen it's done
[49:35] but if you think it's going to happen
[49:37] you're not sure right just like brother
[49:41] brain sees and works as faith expressed
[49:42] he says the Israel I mean the army of
[49:44] Israel knew they could defeat yo they
[49:47] knew it could be done
[49:48] they knew Goliath could be defeated you
[49:51] know but it was only in mental knowing
[49:52] is more like a hope this is my language
[49:54] more like they hoped it could be done
[49:55] because
[49:56] the mental understanding of the wood but
[49:58] David had a revelation that it could be
[50:00] done so he had faith it could be done
[50:03] because it was revealed to him it could
[50:04] be done
[50:06] amen that's why you know that's why this
[50:09] world tries to mix up our mind so much
[50:11] because he's trying to get our mind off
[50:12] the promise we just have to only believe
[50:16] only believe means you don't bring out
[50:19] bring anything into it only is only
[50:21] believe you only believe you don't maybe
[50:24] weigh it up and consider this consider
[50:25] this now you don't consider it I think
[50:28] you just only believe only believe right
[50:32] that's what we're cool to do is to only
[50:34] believe answer David so David you now if
[50:38] he's going to become King in the one
[50:40] who's already on the throne is going to
[50:42] be taken out of the way in God's timing
[50:44] he didn't need to worry about how was
[50:46] going to happen he didn't have to do any
[50:48] political maneuvering and try and win
[50:50] the hearts of the people and work out
[50:51] how he just he waited he knew in God's
[50:53] season he would be ready and Saul would
[50:56] be taken out of the way
[50:57] that's exactly what happened amen and
[51:00] then he also knew that you know he had
[51:03] confidence that God would keep him on
[51:05] the throne when he was even when epsilon
[51:09] raised up God knew here take care of it
[51:12] all ooh yeah Amy and brother bmc's here
[51:17] and yeah now you see me three stages
[51:27] that Elijah followed Elijah Elijah was
[51:30] the type of Christ
[51:31] Elijah the type of the church I go up to
[51:33] Gilgal first justification by faith and
[51:36] he said now you stay here to the church
[51:40] Elijah to Elijah the young and the old
[51:42] prophet a type of Christ and the church
[51:44] he says as your soul lives I'll not stay
[51:47] here but I'm going with you
[51:48] and he went up to Gilgal and when he got
[51:51] up there he said now you stay here the
[51:53] Lord is calling me up to the school of
[51:55] the prophets and he said as the Lord
[51:56] lives and you're sold me of ad I'm going
[51:59] with you I'll not leave you that's the
[52:00] church see keep your eyes on Jesus
[52:02] wherever he moves go if he goes out of
[52:06] the Methodist Church go right out with
[52:08] him he goes out of the Baptist Church
[52:10] go right out with him he good if he goes
[52:12] out of bread them out of the Branham
[52:14] Tabernacle go right on with them
[52:16] I'll not leave you no matter what your
[52:18] mother belong to me your Papa belonged
[52:20] where this happened to another I'll go
[52:22] with you I'll not leave you hallelujah
[52:24] I'm your witness I can't go you're part
[52:26] of me come on and I'll follow and he
[52:30] goes to school the prophecy said you
[52:31] stay here and some of the prophets said
[52:33] to Elijah do you know your master will
[52:35] be taken from you says I know it but
[52:37] hold your peace Amen I like that I'm
[52:39] going to stay with them no matter what
[52:41] the rest of them say and Elijah turned
[52:44] around and said now you tarry here for
[52:45] God is sending me to Jordan three places
[52:48] justification Gilgal sanctification
[52:50] school of prophets and to the baptism of
[52:52] the Holy Ghost at Jordan where Jordan
[52:54] represents death notice Martin Luther
[52:57] John Wesley Pentecost right down to the
[52:58] Jordan dying out time so Elijah walked
[53:01] right on down to the river with Elijah
[53:03] and when they got down to Jordan death
[53:05] last stage of the journey the old
[53:07] prophet reached over pulled off his
[53:08] mantle struck the waters and the waters
[53:11] divided hither and thither and the to
[53:14] walk that cross was on dry land and the
[53:16] preachers stood off looked at them go
[53:18] across amen when they got on the other
[53:21] side now after I hope this soaks into
[53:23] the Branham Tabernacle plumbed down to
[53:25] the marrow of the bone not when he was
[53:28] at Gilgal not when here's at the school
[53:30] of the Prophet neither when he was on
[53:32] the on this side of the Jordan but after
[53:35] he had crossed Jordan following him
[53:37] every step of the way you're willing to
[53:40] say except Jesus my personal Savior I'll
[53:42] quit my bad habits but come down to
[53:44] Jordan where you have to die out where
[53:47] all the things of the world all of your
[53:49] friends and everything has forsaken you
[53:51] keep your eyes on him alone 19:53
[53:54] witnesses hallelujah that's what we have
[53:57] to go I trust if you haven't been there
[53:59] you should go let me recommend it to you
[54:03] amen because that was the only way
[54:06] Elijah could continue Elijah's ministry
[54:08] amen as when that same anointing came
[54:13] upon him then he could continue the work
[54:16] of Elijah and it must be the same thing
[54:19] with us the very same life that was in
[54:22] Jesus Christ now comes
[54:23] upon the believer and then that life now
[54:26] lives out of them amen now he sees here
[54:37] does in the angel of God in 1948 so the
[54:40] hour has come for the repeat of the
[54:41] Bible and the fulfilling of the word now
[54:44] God promised that he was going to send a
[54:47] former rain in the letter rain and he
[54:49] promised the former rain in the latter
[54:50] rain in the and and and a letter and in
[54:54] the letter in other words a double
[54:55] portion like the garment of a of Elijah
[54:59] when Elijah dropped that Elijah picked
[55:01] it up and had a double portion and he
[55:03] was a he was a type as a type of cry of
[55:06] the church and Christ Christ was taken
[55:08] up and the same spirit that was upon
[55:10] Christ is on the church tonight the Holy
[55:12] Ghost seen Iblis if you see me go away
[55:14] shoot Elijah and he took the garment and
[55:16] he struck the Jordan and said let the
[55:19] god of Elijah speak amen and it has to
[55:24] be it is the same thing today I want you
[55:26] to I want you to recognize what you have
[55:29] I mean we can't take for granted the
[55:32] very at the very life of God is in you
[55:33] it's a very precious thing God has put
[55:36] you into service I mean put you into
[55:38] action that his word can be the
[55:41] continuation of his ministry can happen
[55:43] in your life they mean just like Paul
[55:46] and Silas was separated and we'll Paul
[55:48] and Barnabas whoever it was you know for
[55:50] the work to continue in different ways
[55:51] in the book of Acts is same thing with
[55:53] us I mean because that same life comes
[55:56] into us and and it continues on I mean
[56:00] more than just a more than just a church
[56:03] gathering but God's life being expressed
[56:05] upon the earth that's what he wants to
[56:07] do hallelujah I must be the same thing
[56:12] with us so notice he went all the way
[56:16] I'm just going to close with this he
[56:19] went all the way over Jordan and then it
[56:22] became his testimony it has to be the
[56:25] same thing with you and I
[56:27] but I've trust wherever you are in your
[56:30] journey you've already made up your mind
[56:31] if you haven't even if you're still
[56:33] plowing with oxen and you're in in your
[56:36] old life
[56:37] kill the oxen burn the bridges go walk
[56:41] with God you got to make up your mind
[56:43] you can't just say well I'll start with
[56:45] mummy and daddy because there you know
[56:47] it's an individual affair with God
[56:49] individual walk with God there comes a
[56:51] time where he takes you by the hand
[56:53] someone will take us by the hand first
[56:56] our parents lead us then our teachers
[56:58] lead us and then and then maybe our
[57:01] paths will lead us but there comes a
[57:03] time where who's going to lead you after
[57:05] that
[57:06] amen who's going to lead you after that
[57:09] because they will have to you'll have to
[57:11] let go of them and then you get to walk
[57:13] with someone else and there's a place
[57:16] where no mortal can take you
[57:18] there's a door called death no one can
[57:22] take you through that door only one can
[57:26] take you through the door and he's our
[57:28] Lord Jesus Christ and he's the one you
[57:31] want to ultimately lead you from the
[57:32] very beginning right and God can use the
[57:35] mum and the dad which he does and and
[57:38] the teacher and them and the preacher
[57:40] but there comes a time where he's got to
[57:42] lead you brother Brown preaches the
[57:45] sermon leadership and he's preaching to
[57:48] the Pentecostal people people who knew
[57:50] the miracles of God and he preaches that
[57:53] service leadership who who's who's
[57:57] leading you it sounds like a Sunday
[58:00] School lesson but he just lays it out to
[58:02] them don't reject the leadership of
[58:03] eternal life don't be like oh I'll just
[58:07] bring it into that story we were it
[58:08] don't be like the school of the prophets
[58:10] just standing afar off I have religion I
[58:12] go to a church I learned some things you
[58:17] know just standing afar off and they're
[58:19] not even part of what God is doing we
[58:23] want to be following the Lord in this
[58:26] hour amen we have some we have the
[58:31] musicians please I'll just leave it
[58:33] there I trust you've made up your mind I
[58:36] made my mind up when I was 22 it took me
[58:40] a while God was dealing with me for a
[58:42] long time finally I quit I gave up I
[58:47] didn't care about what family said or
[58:49] what friends said or
[58:51] whoever said I didn't worry about them
[58:53] they'll take care of themselves it's me
[58:56] ultimately it's you you can't worry
[58:59] about what other people will say it's
[59:01] young God you know well you know when
[59:05] it's all said and done you'll yeah we'll
[59:06] all give an account and I want my can to
[59:09] be I laid it all down I followed you all
[59:13] the way and of course he knows that
[59:14] before he even I need to say it amen
[59:16] and and that's what I want my testimony
[59:18] to be in 2007 I ceased to be and he
[59:24] began and me just like Enoch Enoch what
[59:30] with God was at 365 years or something
[59:33] well no no he was alive that long the
[59:35] first 65 years of his life he did his
[59:38] own thing he walked with God 300 years
[59:40] and then God took him but they came a
[59:43] time in his life where he SH he ceased
[59:45] walking by himself and then he started
[59:46] to walk with God and then and then God
[59:49] took him in a rapture as a type of you
[59:51] so it doesn't really matter if it was
[59:54] and Enoch was you know maybe you know
[59:57] ultimately it has to come a time in life
[1:00:00] where you walk with God me takes you and
[1:00:02] you're not that should be our testimony
[1:00:05] so be like Elijah so I'm going all the
[1:00:08] way I won't take my eyes off you until a
[1:00:11] double portion of your spirit rests on
[1:00:13] me so you can continue your ministry
[1:00:15] upon the earth it's not my ministry it's
[1:00:18] not my life as you continue your life in
[1:00:20] me
[1:00:21] that's what Elijah wanted he didn't want
[1:00:23] his own life he didn't want to be like
[1:00:24] one of the schools the prophets trying
[1:00:26] to make a name for themselves he wanted
[1:00:27] God's name to be declared he wanted
[1:00:30] God's ministry to be lived they should
[1:00:33] be the same thing with us shouldn't it I
[1:00:35] meant I don't even want to be a footnote
[1:00:37] in history I'm not interested I don't
[1:00:40] care if I'm forgotten if I disappeared
[1:00:42] tomorrow no one remembers me that's fine
[1:00:44] as long as God has remembered right as
[1:00:48] long as God is known I'm satisfied I
[1:00:50] mean this bow heads in a word of Prayer

[1:00:57] you to live well that's what we want

[1:01:17] anointing Lord that was you rested upon
