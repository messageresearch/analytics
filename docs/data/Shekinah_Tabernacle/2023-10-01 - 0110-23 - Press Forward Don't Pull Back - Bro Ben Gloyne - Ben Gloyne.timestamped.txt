[38:48] they've pressed the battle I mean I just
[38:50] want to find some brother brand would
[38:51] say this in the second Miracle he says

[39:13] courage Lord help me and support me by
[39:16] thy Everlasting word yes sir stand on
[39:19] God's word now this is this is a um this
[39:22] is not a an this is like an ABD version
[39:26] of of John Wesley's diary now notice the
[39:29] trouble he went through I'm just going
[39:31] to read it Sunday morning May the 5th
[39:33] preached in St ANS was asked not to come
[39:35] back anymore Sunday p.m. May the 5th
[39:37] preached at St John's Deon said get out
[39:39] and stay out Sunday morning May the 12th
[39:42] preached at St Jude can't go back there
[39:43] either Sunday p.m May the 12th preached
[39:46] at St George is kicked out again Sunday
[39:48] morning May 19th preached that at St
[39:50] somebody else's deacons called special
[39:52] meeting said I couldn't return Sunday
[39:54] p.m. May 19th preached on the street Ked
[39:56] off the street Sunday a.m. May 26th
[39:59] preached in the meadow chased out of the
[40:00] meadow as a bll was turned loose during
[40:02] the service Sunday a.m. the second June
[40:04] preached out of the edge of town was
[40:06] kicked off the highway Sunday p.m. uh
[40:08] second of June afternoon service
[40:10] preached in a pasture 10,000 people came
[40:12] to hear me now this was this was the
[40:14] experience that that that that that John
[40:16] Wesley went through many times he wasn't
[40:19] welcome as as we read he was kicked out
[40:20] of many churches and they and and the
[40:23] reason they got offended at him is
[40:25] because he basically told them you need
[40:26] to know the Lord you need to know Christ
[40:28] you can't just be in a church and be and
[40:30] and say you're a Christian we're all
[40:32] Sinners saved by grace but you need to
[40:34] be saved by grace and they got offended
[40:36] at him because of that now he had a lot
[40:38] of difficulty in his life but he didn't
[40:40] let the difficulty stop him he had a lot
[40:42] of trouble but he didn't let the trouble
[40:44] stop him they'd say well but he was the
[40:46] church age Messenger to the Philadelphia
[40:48] and church age he didn't know that I
[40:50] mean he didn't know his position in the
[40:52] world he just had a burning in his heart
[40:54] that there's lost and dying people out
[40:56] there they've got to know Christ that
[40:57] was his burden that was the thrust of
[40:59] his whole life and he didn't draw back
[41:01] because of all the trouble we just read
[41:03] about you know this would be quite
[41:05] discouraging but there's a difference
[41:06] between discouragement and drawing back
[41:08] okay so when I talk about drawing back
[41:10] I'm not talking about being discouraged
[41:12] we all get discouraged but we shouldn't
[41:14] let the discouragement turn into drawing
[41:16] back okay so so sure we all get
[41:18] discouraged in life we will be and if
[41:21] you haven't you will get it okay but
[41:23] discouragement comes and goes but I
[41:25] trust there's an anchor in the soul that
[41:27] keeps you in spite of all discouragement
[41:29] I mean Teddy Roosevelt Theodore
[41:32] Roosevelt who is one of the um I think
[41:34] he was yeah he was he was the president
[41:36] of the United States uh he you know he
[41:38] was quite a um quite a forceful kind of
[41:41] a man had a lot of energy he said this
[41:44] this is this is from a speech about the
[41:45] man in the arena he says it's not the
[41:48] critic who counts we're all going to
[41:50] have critics they don't count okay don't
[41:53] worry about the critic don't let don't
[41:54] let any critic make you draw back we're
[41:57] pushing on okay it's not the critic who
[42:00] counts it's not the man who points out
[42:02] how the strong man stumbles or where the
[42:04] do of the Deeds could have done them
[42:06] better you know it's amazing how when it
[42:08] comes to any great sporting event
[42:10] there's so many arm armchair coaches and
[42:12] managers and Sportsmen that dissect
[42:15] their team and their failures or their
[42:17] successes and even in successes they
[42:19] rate the players on the field how good
[42:21] they did none of those critics are on
[42:23] the field none of those critics gave
[42:25] their time and their energy and their
[42:27] passion to end up on the field they they
[42:30] couldn't do it they weren't even built
[42:32] to do it I mean you see the smallest
[42:34] scrawniest white guy who's the big
[42:36] biggest critic of the All Blacks he
[42:38] couldn't stand 5 seconds on the field I
[42:41] mean even the smallest player of an
[42:42] international team will just Bowl him
[42:44] over and he'd be in the hospital but yet
[42:46] he'll criticize he'll blame the coaches
[42:49] he wasn't picked to be coach he wasn't
[42:51] in the coaching St you just think about
[42:52] this there's so many critics will
[42:54] criticize but they'll never put
[42:56] one ounce of time or try and get to
[43:00] where that person is that they're
[43:01] criticizing and the reason they're
[43:03] criticizing really is because they're
[43:05] jealous of where that other person is we
[43:07] must never let jealousy come among us we
[43:09] must never be unhappy when someone else
[43:11] is blessed if you want God to bless you
[43:13] you be happy when someone is blessed if
[43:15] you want to be actually stay in the
[43:17] darkness criticize when God does
[43:19] something so we should always be happy
[43:21] when God does something Hallelujah I
[43:23] mean you want God to use you be happy
[43:25] when he uses to someone else amen so
[43:28] it's not see the credit belongs to the
[43:30] man who is actually in the arena amen
[43:32] whose face is marred by dust and sweat
[43:35] and blood who strives valiantly who ears
[43:37] who come short again and again because
[43:40] there is no effort without error and
[43:41] shortcomings I pray God just brand these
[43:44] words into our hearts amen there is no
[43:46] effort without error and shortcoming you
[43:48] say well I fail all the time get up and
[43:49] keep going get up and keep going amen
[43:53] but who does actually strive to do the
[43:55] Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the
[43:58] great devotions who spends himself in a
[44:00] worthy cause who at the best knows in
[44:03] the end the Triumph of high achievement
[44:05] and who at the worst if he fails at
[44:07] least fails while daring
[44:10] greatly I'd rather I'd rather end up in
[44:13] that category than not do anything at
[44:14] all I mean so that his place will never
[44:17] be with those cold and timid Souls who
[44:20] neither know Victory nor
[44:23] defeat I think we should be like this
[44:25] man in the arena
[44:26] amen because remember it's not those on
[44:28] the sideline the critics who think they
[44:29] know better but actually not called for
[44:31] the job it's those who are in the arena
[44:32] that count God's called us into a great
[44:35] arena in this day amen God's called us
[44:37] to fulfill his word in this day see God
[44:39] wants vessels to manifest himself
[44:41] through and you just happen to find
[44:43] yourself in that position so we're not
[44:45] called to draw back and say well you
[44:47] know because we can sit in church and be
[44:48] drawn back that's right you know I'm not
[44:50] talking about just people who just go
[44:52] and leav in the world but we can
[44:53] actually draw back within ourselves and
[44:55] not pess the battle
[44:56] I mean we can be hide behind our
[44:58] families behind our church behind
[45:00] whatever some excuse and draw back but
[45:03] let's not draw back let's push on Amen
[45:06] let's let's let's press the
[45:08] battle Hallelujah see now this
[45:10] confidence is you I'm just going to
[45:12] break down you I love to look into the
[45:13] meaning of words because to me it just
[45:15] brings out the scripture a lot more so
[45:17] cast not away your confidence right so
[45:20] this confidence the Thea Bible dict
[45:22] tells us is a freedom in speaking and
[45:24] unreserved and
[45:27] speech and open frankly without
[45:29] concealment yeah this world does not
[45:32] like Frank talk it doesn't even like
[45:35] debate are many discussions that we
[45:37] would you know talk about you know
[45:40] there's a lot of things that we can't
[45:41] talk about you know I heard sorry Josh
[45:44] I'm just throw you into it but they were
[45:45] talking about transgender stuff in their
[45:47] classroom and you know the teacher says
[45:49] is there any questions he says we can't
[45:51] really talk about this can we just move
[45:52] on we can't really say what we want to
[45:54] say can we just move on that's how this
[45:56] world is but at least he's honest to say
[45:59] because everyone else is W to say he's
[46:00] the only honest one in the class is you
[46:01] know you know we're not going to accept
[46:03] what we're going to say so let's just
[46:04] move on with it right but you see this
[46:06] world has come in such a way that we
[46:08] can't be frank sometimes we need to be
[46:10] frank sure there sometimes we got to be
[46:12] a little bit gentle but sometimes
[46:14] there's got a frankness got to come I
[46:16] mean that you can't just pity party with
[46:18] the devil you got to go really push on
[46:20] let's go beyond you know the poor Mees
[46:22] of life if our focus is is on us in any
[46:26] way we're not going to get it we're
[46:28] going to draw back and we're going to
[46:29] get into that soon I mean so it's it's
[46:31] without ambiguity or circum location of
[46:34] that's how you say that word now that
[46:36] word basically means just saying a word
[46:37] salad who's heard that word you know a
[46:39] word salad like a politician ask a
[46:41] question and they give a 20 minute
[46:43] answer but they don't answer anything
[46:45] that's a word s just throw out some
[46:46] words and maybe just you know that's
[46:48] basically what that word means I had to
[46:50] look it up you know so people say what
[46:52] do you
[46:53] believe don't let it be a word salad
[46:56] let it be God's restored the truth of
[46:58] his word God has sent a prophet sure
[47:00] there's a lot of scarecrows but he's
[47:01] restored his word we have the book of
[47:03] Acts his word is alive he's true he's
[47:06] not an argument he lives come and see
[47:08] amen let me share my testimony what it's
[47:10] how it's impacted my life amen I think
[47:13] that's a pretty straight way to answer
[47:14] because you are God's billboard right we
[47:17] are the advertising amen hallelujah and
[47:20] we say hey this thing works praise God I
[47:23] I tasted and saw the Lord is good he's
[47:25] changed my life
[47:26] amen see without use of figures and
[47:29] comparison see we shouldn't compare you
[47:32] know well if this happens this well the
[47:34] you the Giants are too big in the land
[47:35] like you the 10 spies did they're
[47:37] comparing Caleb and Joshua said no no
[47:39] we're not comparing God said let's take
[47:41] it amen free and fearless confidence
[47:44] cheerful courage boldness and Assurance
[47:47] amen the deportment by which one becomes
[47:49] a conspicuous or secures publicity we
[47:53] want to not lose our confidence
[47:56] amen we should be more confident than
[47:57] ever He's Able He's Able he's more than
[48:01] able doesn't matter what's going on our
[48:03] favorite song if you've ever seen the L
[48:05] forains they have a an now worship I
[48:07] don't a night of worship where you know
[48:09] there whole bunch of singers and stuff
[48:11] and one of the choir sings a song He's
[48:12] Able if you ever feel down yeah I'll put
[48:15] the link out you'll like it it's real
[48:17] good that's our favorite song He's Able
[48:19] we came to church playing that song He's
[48:21] Able I said Lord you're able amen you're
[48:24] able to turn turn service into a SE
[48:26] Supernatural event and you're able to
[48:28] turn a fellowship at a place where you
[48:30] step in and change our lives amen you're
[48:32] able oh God because you're the same
[48:34] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[48:37] now am this word uh it's very
[48:39] interesting it says if any man draw back
[48:41] now this word drawback is one word and
[48:43] it's the Timothy of one stealthily
[48:47] retreating this our people drawback it's
[48:49] not just an open I quit bye just abrupt
[48:52] there's been there's been time maybe
[48:55] years years where it's a stealthly I'm
[48:58] withdrawing it's not outwardly openly
[49:01] just you know I'm gone that's that's the
[49:05] that's the manifestation of a stealthly
[49:07] retreat you if someone's stealthly
[49:09] retreating they don't make a bunch of
[49:10] noise about it they just slowly withdraw
[49:14] and they pretend like they're not
[49:16] because they're trying to be sneaky and
[49:18] they just begin to withdraw themselves
[49:19] from The Fellowship of believers they
[49:21] withdraw themselves from the word they
[49:23] don't talk about God so much anymore
[49:25] they bring the emphasis on onto
[49:27] something else and their problems what
[49:29] they're going through and their troubles
[49:30] and it's a stealthly retreat but the but
[49:34] the end goal is I'm gone see the devil
[49:37] doesn't the devil just wants us to
[49:39] withdraw wants us to have a stealthly
[49:41] retreat and even that Retreat can be not
[49:43] even leaving the fellowship but
[49:46] withdrawing from actually pushing a
[49:47] fervent desire to please God I mean can
[49:50] be just a withdrawal than ourselves well
[49:52] I'm part of the church I'm a good person
[49:54] you know that can just be a stealthy
[49:56] Retreat as well cuz we can look like
[49:58] Believers act like like Believers speak
[50:00] like Believers but we don't have a life
[50:01] of the believer the Holy Ghost himself
[50:03] within us amen so we don't want to have
[50:06] the stealthly retreat I think we should
[50:07] press on Amen that we shouldn't withdraw
[50:10] even within ourselves our own thoughts
[50:12] and our own ways but we should really
[50:14] push the battle who wants to push the
[50:16] battle today amen we've been given the
[50:18] greatest opportunity in this day amen to
[50:20] take a Rapture so I think I think we
[50:22] should press in like never before amen
[50:24] so we don't want to stealth Retreat I
[50:26] mean cuz there's a saying that many
[50:27] people leave church before they leave
[50:29] church in their minds they're they're
[50:31] gone somewhere I trust you're not gone
[50:34] somewhere I trust you're here saying
[50:36] Lord change my life I want more of you I
[50:39] want to have some time with you Lord
[50:41] amen speak to me Lord minister to my
[50:43] life Lord I'm here I love you Lord I
[50:45] mean I trust I trust that's your heart
[50:46] asire this morning so we don't want to
[50:48] have a stealthly retreat amen because
[50:51] God has no pleasure in this we want God
[50:54] to be pleased with our lives
[50:56] like he said about his own son you know
[50:57] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[50:59] pleased wouldn't you want that to be
[51:01] your testimony where God speaks of you
[51:03] it's may be just a phrase but it's you
[51:05] know how God sums you up to the devil
[51:07] I'm well pleased in this one there's
[51:09] there's no one like him or her in all
[51:11] the Earth I'm pleased with how they
[51:12] conduct themselves in a trial I'm
[51:14] pleased how they conduct themselves not
[51:16] just in church but everywhere wherever
[51:18] they are Supermarket driving at home
[51:21] with their children with their whoever
[51:24] it is I'm pleased how they conduct
[51:26] themselves you know that brother B says
[51:28] a man can be so surrender to God that
[51:30] the devil don't know what to do with
[51:31] them I mean that you know you the devil
[51:33] can give you sickness give you trouble
[51:35] give you heartache give you sorrow give
[51:36] you broken family broken life but then
[51:39] there's something beig you're so
[51:40] surrendered you can't you can't go back
[51:43] there's no drawing back there's no
[51:44] retreat amen and the devil just you know
[51:46] comes to a place he scratches his head
[51:48] saying man I just don't know what to do
[51:49] with this guy I've given them trouble
[51:51] after trouble test after test sickness
[51:53] after sickness mind bad after mind
[51:55] battle you know trouble all
[51:57] around and they're still here I just
[52:01] can't do anything with this guy he's a
[52:03] big problem I want to be the devil's
[52:05] problem Hallelujah May might be looking
[52:07] at me like man you're a crazy man but
[52:10] the Lord is so good to us he's redeemed
[52:13] us from hell am mean he's redeemed us
[52:15] from Darkness amen he's you know he's
[52:17] he's put the Rapture within us by the
[52:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost we are really
[52:21] going to walk on streets of gold one day
[52:23] I mean we're really going to see him
[52:24] face to face we're really going to see
[52:26] the devil burn
[52:27] up I'm going to enjoy that moment you
[52:30] you anyway but I want to see the Lord
[52:32] Jesus most and first and foremost but
[52:35] you see this this this this stealthy
[52:37] retreating always begins with a doubt
[52:40] because you always because a person no
[52:43] matter they always go from one thing to
[52:45] another there's always something that
[52:47] people go to now the devil came along to
[52:49] Eve and you know he made her stealthily
[52:53] Retreat from God's word with a quick
[52:55] question yeah hath God said is that
[52:58] really true that if you eat this fruit
[53:00] you're going to die and all you know it
[53:01] just starts with a question and the
[53:03] devil loves to come to you with
[53:05] questions are you really if you're
[53:07] really a Believer why would you do this
[53:09] if you're really a Christian why would
[53:10] you do this and you know questions and
[53:13] he's trying to get you to doubt your
[53:15] salvation try to doubt your position you
[53:17] see but he but what he's trying to
[53:19] really ultimately do is put a question
[53:21] mark on the power of the blood in your
[53:23] life yeah see the Devil's the devil's
[53:26] tactic is see the Book of Revelation no
[53:29] no well I just read the whole quote now
[53:30] remember this that Christ and the true
[53:32] church is a continuation of the book of
[53:34] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[53:36] how the Antichrist Spirit would come
[53:38] into the church and defile it making it
[53:40] lukew formal and Powerless it exposes
[53:43] Satan revealing his Works which is the
[53:44] attempted destruction of God's people
[53:46] and the discrediting of God's word right
[53:49] down pardon me to the time he's cast
[53:51] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[53:53] cannot stand it so he he wants to try
[53:56] and destroy you and he wants to
[53:58] discredit God's word in your life yeah
[54:00] see the power of it the potency of it
[54:02] the ability of it he wants to dilute
[54:05] that down to get you to think it can't
[54:07] really do what it says it will do but it
[54:09] will do exactly what it says it will do
[54:11] I mean God's word is more than able what
[54:13] he promised he will do amen so he tries
[54:16] to make us lukewarm formal and power see
[54:18] that is someone who is withdrawn who has
[54:21] pulled back amen but we're not called to
[54:23] pull back we're called to push on
[54:26] amen because we don't want to be see we
[54:28] we're in such a a a a deceiving age
[54:31] where it's a lukewarm age see someone
[54:34] who lukewarm is a little bit hot and a
[54:36] little bit cold mixed together that's
[54:37] how you get lukewarm water bit of hot
[54:39] bit of cold it's not completely hot
[54:41] otherwise it would burn be on fire it's
[54:43] not completely cold otherwise it would
[54:45] freeze so there's a mixture of both so
[54:47] there's a bit of God and a bit of the
[54:48] world and makes a lukewarmness and
[54:51] indifference you know it causes someone
[54:53] to lose their enthusiasm their
[54:55] abandonment to God the sin sincere
[54:57] desire to please him you see and this
[54:59] world is a lukewarm world but we're
[55:01] called to cast out that lukewarm spirit
[55:04] I mean we are not ordained to live by
[55:06] that lukewarm Spirit but the devil wants
[55:08] us to pull back into lukewarmness but
[55:11] said let's push on into fervent fire
[55:13] amen let's push on into where all things
[55:15] are possible am mean let's push on to
[55:17] see the realities of the word of God
[55:19] manifesting Amen where we lose control
[55:22] and God takes control amen I think
[55:24] that's how we should be amen that it's
[55:26] no longer I that liveth but Christ that
[55:27] liveth in me like Paul said amen it's
[55:29] not us trying to be a Christian we let
[55:31] him be the Christian in US amen if he
[55:33] wants to shout let him shout through you
[55:36] if he wants to dance let him dance
[55:37] through you if he wants to do whatever
[55:39] he wants to do live a surrendered life
[55:41] let him live it through you what
[55:43] surrender to what the word of God Amen
[55:46] you see now it's our live seat I think
[55:49] you know like in Wesley's day the church
[55:52] had gone so calvinistic you know in
[55:54] terms of well if you're predestinated
[55:55] you'll be there if not you're not just
[55:57] like we don't need to do any Mission
[55:58] work let's just rest cuz God knows who's
[56:01] there and God you know we can we can
[56:03] lean too much that way and become so
[56:06] calvinistic in our think oh but we're in
[56:07] the message but we're still human right
[56:10] we shouldn't lean we you know we we're
[56:12] going to be in the middle of the road we
[56:15] really it's the life we now live shows
[56:18] what we are you know brother Ram says in
[56:21] Investments that the word in you
[56:23] produces the Life of Christ if take the
[56:25] life out of a peach tree and put it in a
[56:27] peer it wouldn't bear peaches no more it
[56:30] would it would have peers on it because
[56:32] the life in the tree produces what it is
[56:34] the life that's in you shows what you
[56:36] are your life testifies so loud in you
[56:39] until your testimony is not heard they
[56:41] know what you are by the life you live
[56:43] and the things that you do am mean if
[56:46] the Life of Christ is in you then
[56:47] therefore the works and Life of Christ
[56:49] you live because that's his life living
[56:51] through you you're just in a vessel to
[56:53] carry on the work of God Amen so it's a
[56:56] life we now live now now here's the
[57:00] question if if Mercy was over right now
[57:02] where would you
[57:03] be what condition would you be in would
[57:07] you be in or would you be out you know
[57:09] is the saying about the Titanic there
[57:10] was rich poor whatever but when the boat
[57:12] was going down there was either lost or
[57:14] saved it was just two groups where are
[57:16] we now honestly where are we now see
[57:19] there's such a lukewarmness I'm
[57:21] preaching to myself very much today
[57:22] there's such a lukewarmness of just a
[57:24] coasting through life especially in Shi
[57:27] be right New Zealand we have this
[57:28] problem of the Shi be right kind of just
[57:30] coasting but and and that's the devil
[57:32] wants us to Coast but God wants us to
[57:35] walk with him it's a very different
[57:36] thing from coast see you say but what
[57:38] about being in rest sure I'm resting but
[57:40] I'm fighting I'm resting because I know
[57:43] where I'm going I mean but now I want
[57:45] that salvation to manifest through me to
[57:48] everyone around me amen and that every
[57:50] promise will be manifested I want to see
[57:52] God do everything in his book amen that
[57:54] that is concerning me amen so our so we
[57:57] may have the greatest testimony in the
[57:59] world but the life we now live is so
[58:00] loud we can't hear the testimony so what
[58:04] so in the condition we are right now
[58:05] where would we be where are we going I
[58:08] just want we to think about this for a
[58:09] second I love you all okay but let's
[58:11] just think about because there'll come a
[58:13] time when Mercy's done you know that
[58:15] just like that um um that Israeli
[58:17] message believer report I put on
[58:19] brothers and sisters I scrolled down to
[58:22] where there's the quotes of brother
[58:23] Braham in Hebrew and I just showed them
[58:25] to Christine I said look at this to me
[58:28] that gripped me because here's Believers
[58:31] now the bride is made up of Jew and
[58:32] Gentile but now here's his his his
[58:35] Jewish
[58:36] bride translating the message this end
[58:39] time full restoration message into
[58:41] Hebrew the gospel's going back there I
[58:44] thinking where are we I can't read it
[58:47] but but but you know because it's in
[58:48] Hebrew but it really I thought man it's
[58:51] here we're here we're here in the end
[58:53] you know I think it's pilg was progress
[58:55] I haven't read the book but you know the
[58:57] last part of the challenge they went
[58:58] through was they kept falling asleep
[59:00] that was one of the last dangerous Parts
[59:02] they went through on their Journey I've
[59:03] told they keep falling asleep they to
[59:05] wake each other up now I think we're
[59:07] living in that time I really think
[59:09] Pilgrim's Progress from what I've heard
[59:10] and scene it's really a prophecy of down
[59:12] through seven Church ages right and
[59:14] we're around the end time where it's so
[59:16] easy to fall asleep let's not fall
[59:17] asleep let's not pull back let's push
[59:20] forward I mean let's not pull back into
[59:21] the just Comfort but let's push forward
[59:23] out of our comfort zone with God Amen
[59:26] let's not get comfortable and say well
[59:27] here's my family here's my church this
[59:29] is what I do go beyond that Amen Let God
[59:32] live in your life like never
[59:34] before amen so you know we want to we
[59:37] want to not draw
[59:40] back now there's many times in the
[59:43] scripture we can see people drew back
[59:44] but yet they were still Believers cor
[59:47] and Dayan Drew back from God's
[59:49] leadership they drew back to say you
[59:51] take too much on yourselves they gather
[59:53] themselves together against Moses and
[59:54] Aaron now they weren't gathering for
[59:57] them to help them they were gathering
[59:58] against them why because they drew back
[1:00:00] and say you take too much on yourselves
[1:00:02] we want God speaks to us too how dare
[1:00:05] you say you're the only Authority you
[1:00:06] know how dare you say the you know the
[1:00:08] word is the only Authority we have you
[1:00:10] know so they didn't leave Israel they
[1:00:13] were still part of the congregation but
[1:00:15] they drew back into their own ideas we
[1:00:17] don't want to draw back into those
[1:00:18] things to a to just a comfort zone of
[1:00:21] existing let's push
[1:00:23] on he amen let's push on but you see now
[1:00:26] the word isn't based on human
[1:00:29] interpretation see he says knowing this
[1:00:31] verse that no prophecy of scriptures of
[1:00:33] any private interpretation now many
[1:00:35] people think well it that means it'll
[1:00:37] just be a group consensus that's not
[1:00:39] what the scripture says because if he
[1:00:40] continue he says for the prophecy came
[1:00:42] not an old time by the will of man but
[1:00:45] the holy men of God spake as they were
[1:00:47] moved by the Holy Ghost this is how the
[1:00:49] prophecy came it wasn't man's private
[1:00:51] interpretation but God moved on men to
[1:00:53] speak his will to the Earth amen and
[1:00:56] it's those who receive that will pushed
[1:00:59] in amen and got what they wanted Caleb
[1:01:01] and Joshua heard the same words cor and
[1:01:03] Dayan heard but some of them Drew back
[1:01:06] and others pushed forward am mean you
[1:01:08] see see the confidence that Caleb and
[1:01:10] Joshua had was not in Moses it was in
[1:01:13] the god in Moses here's a big difference
[1:01:15] see they saw Moses failures they saw
[1:01:17] everything that Israel did but their
[1:01:19] confidence wasn't in Moses their
[1:01:20] confidence was in the word amen and if
[1:01:23] our confidence is in the word amen I
[1:01:25] believe that same spirit will come upon
[1:01:27] us and we'll push in and take every
[1:01:29] promise amen we must fight if we must
[1:01:32] Reign I mean we're not given a free pass
[1:01:34] I mean every age had its difficulty we
[1:01:37] have our difficulties if they overcame
[1:01:39] we will overcome amen the same Jesus
[1:01:41] that caused him to overcome will cause
[1:01:43] us to overcome but what are you doing
[1:01:45] about it amen are you are you pulling
[1:01:47] back and saying well you know I'm
[1:01:48] looking forward to Christmas Camp's
[1:01:50] coming I'm going to sit back and watch
[1:01:51] the world go by I've got other burdens
[1:01:53] of life or you pushing
[1:01:55] forward we all have families or we're
[1:01:57] part of a family we all all got cares of
[1:01:59] Life bills to pay economic troubles
[1:02:02] whatever more debts things but is that
[1:02:04] causing you to pull back or you pushing
[1:02:06] forward with
[1:02:07] God which one do you want to have amen
[1:02:11] he says now the just shall live by faith
[1:02:12] if any man draw back my soul shall have
[1:02:15] no pleasure in him amen so that word
[1:02:17] pleasure means it seems good to one it's
[1:02:19] one's good pleasure to think good to
[1:02:21] choose determine or decide I want God to
[1:02:24] choose me to to actually decide I'm
[1:02:27] proud of my son here I'm pleased with
[1:02:29] him I know I've said it before but who
[1:02:31] wants God to be pleased with them amen
[1:02:33] am mean to do willingly to be ready to
[1:02:35] prefer to choose rather to be well
[1:02:38] pleased with take pleasure and to be
[1:02:40] favorably inclined towards one amen
[1:02:42] that's that's what I want God to think
[1:02:44] towards me about I mean to be favorably
[1:02:46] inclined towards me amen when I'm
[1:02:48] praying the archangels have got to hush
[1:02:50] up because God's listening to my prayer
[1:02:53] amen you because Gabriel and WW they
[1:02:55] could all be doing things in heaven but
[1:02:56] then as soon as I got on my knees or I'm
[1:02:58] just driving in the car just talking to
[1:03:00] God he says sh quite everyone of course
[1:03:03] it's just a dead silence come over comes
[1:03:05] comes into heaven because they
[1:03:07] listen my son's talking to me amen I'm
[1:03:10] sorry but you're down the list cuz he's
[1:03:12] my priority cuz he's part of me he's
[1:03:14] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life
[1:03:17] of my life he's part of me he's named by
[1:03:19] my name he's been redeemed by by by my
[1:03:22] blood amen hallelujah I trust we live
[1:03:25] those and remember it's not oh let's
[1:03:27] just jump to this I'm just going to let
[1:03:29] let's just go here picture speaks a
[1:03:31] thousand words okay let's go here I've
[1:03:34] been talking about praise these last few
[1:03:36] Sundays you Garment of Praise and the
[1:03:38] oil of gladness and so on now this is a
[1:03:40] picture of the parable Jesus speaks
[1:03:42] about the public you know the you know
[1:03:43] the Pharisee and the Publican in the
[1:03:45] temple I'm not going to use it exactly
[1:03:46] but the thing is now here is here is
[1:03:48] this is how we draw back or can draw
[1:03:50] back here's the Pharisee who thinks he's
[1:03:52] awesome I'm a a Believer my family's all
[1:03:55] in line my wife's in line remember the
[1:03:59] message brother R preached is not as
[1:04:00] your life as your wife worthy of the
[1:04:02] Gospel it's is your life worthy of the
[1:04:05] Gospel two very different things well my
[1:04:07] family's in line they say the right
[1:04:09] things they do the right things that
[1:04:10] play the right part I believe all the
[1:04:12] words open I can tell you every
[1:04:14] Revelation I know I know quotes and you
[1:04:16] know numbers and chapters and verses and
[1:04:19] I can string it all together let me draw
[1:04:20] you a chart I've been to every
[1:04:22] convention look at the pins I have I got
[1:04:24] photos in Sabino Canyon you know I I'm
[1:04:27] glad I'm not like the others in the
[1:04:28] church who are not so well revelated I
[1:04:30] pray for them quite a lot Lord give them
[1:04:33] the Revelation that you've given
[1:04:34] me and it's a
[1:04:37] comparison well if I I wouldn't let my
[1:04:41] family be like that family that's
[1:04:43] comparison I wouldn't let my kid do that
[1:04:47] don't say that because I've seen people
[1:04:50] have given child raising advice and
[1:04:53] their children have done 10 times
[1:04:55] worse oh yeah it's true never ever put
[1:04:59] those judgments on someone cuz you'll
[1:05:01] find the measure you give out as a
[1:05:02] measure you receive really it should be
[1:05:05] Lord I need Grace Lord I need your
[1:05:07] enablement I need your spirit of my life
[1:05:09] Lord I need you I need you Lord Lord I
[1:05:13] don't want to compare myself to anyone
[1:05:14] Lord I just want you to live Lord Lord I
[1:05:17] never want to be condescending in my
[1:05:19] thoughts towards another believer or
[1:05:20] someone who's teetering or whatever more
[1:05:22] I never ever want but you see the phes
[1:05:24] like that Lord I'm awesome that's
[1:05:28] basically how he is Lord I'm I'm God's
[1:05:31] gift to the Earth no Jesus Christ is
[1:05:33] God's gift to the Earth amen I'm the
[1:05:37] best believer I'm in the best church I'm
[1:05:39] whatever whatever whatever you see see
[1:05:41] he's that way but now so that's one way
[1:05:44] to draw back why because his heart is
[1:05:46] not focused on his lamb his heart and
[1:05:51] his life is not focused on the Lord he's
[1:05:52] worshiping himself True by comparing you
[1:05:56] begin to worship what what becomes
[1:05:57] exalted when you compare it's not God
[1:06:00] it's you you see so we never want to be
[1:06:02] in that comparison kind of way of that
[1:06:05] guy look at me everyone get my best side
[1:06:08] you
[1:06:10] know but then so that's one way to draw
[1:06:12] back but then equally there's another
[1:06:14] way to draw back here's the man down in
[1:06:16] here like this I'm
[1:06:18] unworthy I'm never going to get there
[1:06:21] Lord how could you ever forgive a sinner
[1:06:23] such as I now you start off that way but
[1:06:27] you can stay that way Lord look at my
[1:06:30] past look at what I've done wrong look
[1:06:32] at me I'm never overcoming I'm never
[1:06:35] Lord I've had the same trouble for year
[1:06:38] after year see the focus is still not on
[1:06:40] God the focus is still on the person
[1:06:44] right the focus he's still focusing
[1:06:45] inwardly about himself Lord there's this
[1:06:48] problem and I see these people Prosper
[1:06:50] Lord I see this guy up there looking up
[1:06:52] towards heaven I can't be like that Lord
[1:06:55] I'm like this what's he done he's
[1:06:57] actually pulled back because he's not
[1:07:00] looking at his lamb I trust this comes
[1:07:02] out in the right way he's not looking at
[1:07:04] God he's looking at himself sure we we
[1:07:08] always come to a spot before we meet the
[1:07:10] Lord Lord I'm unworthy Lord I'm wretched
[1:07:13] Lord my sin is great I'm I'm wicked I'm
[1:07:16] evil Lord clear but then you don't stay
[1:07:19] that way because you come to him on
[1:07:21] faith saying Lord I'm like this but you
[1:07:22] can change me like you
[1:07:24] Lord I'm a sinner I'm riched I got this
[1:07:26] filthy Fallen nature that drives my life
[1:07:28] and I can't be free but Lord you can
[1:07:30] free me Lord hallelujah so you don't
[1:07:32] stay like that but you turn into the
[1:07:35] right way amen but you see now both
[1:07:37] those men are focusing on themselves
[1:07:40] one's the Pharisee message person and
[1:07:43] one is the false humility unbelief
[1:07:46] message person but they both focused on
[1:07:49] themselves and both can look right yeah
[1:07:53] but you see they've taken their
[1:07:54] attention off their lamb amen and so
[1:07:58] this is how you know that you really
[1:07:59] praise the Lord with your life is you're
[1:08:02] not focusing on yourself in any way but
[1:08:05] your focus is on your lamb I mean
[1:08:08] because what you look at brings a
[1:08:10] reaction right what you look at brings a
[1:08:12] reaction like John John in you know
[1:08:14] Revelations 4 and 5 is weeping because
[1:08:16] he saw no man was worthy to take the
[1:08:18] book but then he saw the same one that
[1:08:21] was in the boat with him the same one he
[1:08:23] walked with the same when he saw say
[1:08:24] Lazarus come forth the same when he saw
[1:08:26] die on Calvary the same one he saw
[1:08:28] resurrected was the same one stepped out
[1:08:31] amen and took the book and It produced a
[1:08:33] rejoicing praise out of his life because
[1:08:36] his focus wasn't on himself being
[1:08:38] unworthy his focus wasn't on the rest of
[1:08:41] the man being unworthy his Focus was on
[1:08:44] him amen and if your focus is really on
[1:08:47] the Lord it will produce a praise out of
[1:08:50] your life whether you're in church out
[1:08:52] of your church at home on your job
[1:08:54] wherever you are why because you're
[1:08:55] looking at what he has done and you're
[1:08:58] looking at what he is doing in you amen
[1:09:01] and it produces such a
[1:09:03] Thanksgiving amen if you're looking
[1:09:05] right it produces a Thanksgiving if
[1:09:07] you're looking the wrong way it just
[1:09:08] produces a judgment upon
[1:09:10] yourself amen so we want to always have
[1:09:13] a
[1:09:14] praise amen so don't be like those
[1:09:17] guys be like the thankful worshipper
[1:09:20] Hallelujah Lord You're My lamb you're my
[1:09:22] king I was lost and now I'm found I was
[1:09:26] blind and now I see I was wretched now
[1:09:28] I'm cleansed am mean I was covered in
[1:09:31] sin and I'm cover in righteousness amen
[1:09:34] it's all you Lord hallelujah that's how
[1:09:37] we should be friends see we should never
[1:09:39] be focused on how good we think we are
[1:09:41] because you know oh your brother Andy's
[1:09:43] not here but we're talking on Wednesday
[1:09:44] about you know like in the drug world
[1:09:46] there's this there's this term it's
[1:09:48] called a delusion of
[1:09:49] grandeur where people who become either
[1:09:51] drug dealers or they just high on drugs
[1:09:53] whatever they think they have S they
[1:09:55] think they're awesome but it's a
[1:09:57] delusion of
[1:10:00] grandeur because really they're not that
[1:10:02] great at all they're a slave to a spirit
[1:10:05] yeah this guy has a delusion of
[1:10:09] grandeur because he's a slave to a
[1:10:11] spirit he's a slave to a self-righteous
[1:10:13] religious spirit he thinks he's awesome
[1:10:16] but he's nothing that's a delusion of
[1:10:19] grandeur amen but when you really meet
[1:10:21] the Lord you don't have a delusion of
[1:10:22] grandeur
[1:10:24] you're humble you're loving you're kind
[1:10:27] you love him Hallelujah am mean you
[1:10:29] don't think you're something that you're
[1:10:31] not you know what he's made you but it
[1:10:33] doesn't make you like
[1:10:35] that right it makes you like this but
[1:10:38] with a thankful heart thank you Lord for
[1:10:40] saving me I'm just using the expression
[1:10:43] on the guy as opposed to the I can never
[1:10:45] get anywhere kind of a right is this is
[1:10:47] this all fine I believe amen so so we
[1:10:50] have we always want him to be our praise
[1:10:52] amen amen amen we want to contend for
[1:10:55] the faith once
[1:10:58] delivered for the Saints see it's very
[1:11:01] easy to be against something but what
[1:11:03] about being for something see it's very
[1:11:05] easy to criticize something is wrong
[1:11:08] that's drawing back cor and daythan were
[1:11:10] criticizing Moses and Aaron but they
[1:11:12] drew back they didn't push on with the
[1:11:13] promise you don't hear Caleb and Joshua
[1:11:15] criticizing Moses and Aaron no they
[1:11:19] pushed on with a full Assurance they had
[1:11:21] a full confidence we're going into the
[1:11:23] land God's given us the land every
[1:11:25] promise is over the Jordan we're going
[1:11:27] there amen every promise is in the
[1:11:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen every
[1:11:32] promise is Over Yonder and we have been
[1:11:34] called to possess every promise so it's
[1:11:36] easy to criticize where people are wrong
[1:11:39] and sure we make many mistakes we're
[1:11:42] human right humans make mistakes it's
[1:11:44] what they do amen but you see now it's
[1:11:46] easy to speak against something but what
[1:11:48] are we contending for am me what are you
[1:11:51] contending for in your life are you are
[1:11:53] you contending for just an easy life
[1:11:55] don't just contend for that we should
[1:11:58] know we should be contending for God
[1:11:59] living we should be contending for his
[1:12:02] word putting on flesh we should be
[1:12:04] contending that his promises are
[1:12:05] manifested that we don't just talk about
[1:12:07] it it's not just a family tradition you
[1:12:09] see Wesley you know he be his life
[1:12:11] became a tradition to the methodists
[1:12:14] sure they read his books well probably
[1:12:15] they don't read them anymore maybe they
[1:12:17] throw away his sermons but you know it
[1:12:19] was a tradition what he did and it can
[1:12:21] become a tradition what happened to
[1:12:22] brother bram's life let's not it be a
[1:12:24] tradition amen but let it be yes Lord
[1:12:27] you live there but Lord once more Lord
[1:12:28] live now amen you're the same God you
[1:12:30] were there but may you be alive now I
[1:12:32] mean sure maybe you because you're the
[1:12:35] same God so if you're the same God you
[1:12:37] do the same things and we believe the
[1:12:39] same word and we have the same faith and
[1:12:41] we have the same Holy Ghost amen so if
[1:12:43] we have those same things Lord send your
[1:12:45] power amen and prove that you're alive
[1:12:48] see we should be see we should be
[1:12:49] contending for the faith that was once
[1:12:51] delivered to the Saints amen so what are
[1:12:54] we contending for see this is just
[1:12:56] jumping around see but you see it's the
[1:12:59] way the devil wants to come I'll be all
[1:13:01] right see it'll be all right for you to
[1:13:02] join Church see that's not pushing on
[1:13:04] that's drawing back but don't you ever
[1:13:06] forgive Jones it'll be all right if you
[1:13:08] can bring in your see you can go you you
[1:13:11] don't have to give up you're smoking
[1:13:12] you're drinking you're lying you're
[1:13:13] stealing your fault finding you're
[1:13:15] backbiting I'll say your jealousy you
[1:13:17] don't have to give that up you don't
[1:13:18] have to give up your resentment and the
[1:13:20] poor me and the wise and no see the
[1:13:22] devil says bring that with you God says
[1:13:25] give it to me amen I'd rather give it to
[1:13:27] the Lord than carry it around see you
[1:13:29] don't have to give that up just join the
[1:13:30] church but Moses wasn't a compromiser he
[1:13:33] wanted complete deliverance he said
[1:13:35] we'll not leave one hoof behind we'll
[1:13:37] take everything that belongs to us when
[1:13:39] we go to Worship the Lord and that's the
[1:13:42] way the church ought to be we'll take
[1:13:44] righteousness this is what we're
[1:13:46] contending for we'll take righteousness
[1:13:48] we'll take Holiness we'll take the Holy
[1:13:50] Spirit we'll take a unified group when
[1:13:52] we go to go to the altar we'll be a real
[1:13:55] group we'll leave nothing behind we'll
[1:13:57] take everything there won't be one ho
[1:13:59] stay back here you know and people can
[1:14:00] pray and such a way till the devil will
[1:14:02] have to give in amen that's the way
[1:14:04] Moses and his group did they got over
[1:14:06] there and under the blood you notice
[1:14:07] until they got under the blood there was
[1:14:10] no total Deliverance am me but I'll say
[1:14:12] once they got under the blood there was
[1:14:13] total Deliverance amen they left Egypt
[1:14:16] when they got under the blood I mean
[1:14:18] they left Pharaoh behind they left the
[1:14:19] enemy behind they left their task
[1:14:21] Masters behind they left behind because
[1:14:24] they weren't bringing them with them
[1:14:25] they're saying you stay here we're going
[1:14:27] this way and it should be the same thing
[1:14:29] with you and I depression we're leaving
[1:14:31] you behind anxiety we're leaving you
[1:14:33] behind jealousy we're leaving you behind
[1:14:35] resentment we're leaving you behind
[1:14:37] we're not taking you with but we're
[1:14:39] taking Joy we're taking peace we're
[1:14:42] taking God moving amen we're taking the
[1:14:43] love and Liberty in the spirit we're
[1:14:45] taking Faith we're taking Revelation
[1:14:47] we're taking our children we're taking
[1:14:49] our loved ones amen we're taking
[1:14:50] everything you have God we're bringing
[1:14:52] it with amen and we will not stop until
[1:14:55] we get everything Hallelujah see we can
[1:14:58] pray until the devil has to give in amen
[1:15:01] I believe we can do it amen I believe we
[1:15:03] can have such a burden say oh God if
[1:15:06] you've promised it in your word I want
[1:15:07] it Lord I'm not going to rest I'm going
[1:15:09] to say well it's not their season who
[1:15:11] says it's not their season today is the
[1:15:14] day of salvation amen or it'll be
[1:15:16] another time who said it'll be another
[1:15:17] time why not today I mean why not today
[1:15:20] it can be today I I think today is a
[1:15:22] good day this is the day the Lord has
[1:15:24] made we will rejoice and be glad in it
[1:15:26] amen so I think we'll just take it we'll
[1:15:28] take healing we'll take everything we'll
[1:15:30] not let the devil keep anything back
[1:15:32] amen see this was Moses's burden and you
[1:15:35] see the father of Moses had a burden
[1:15:37] brother Brown dramatized it that Abraham
[1:15:40] after he was you know being a slave
[1:15:41] during the day came home whip marks and
[1:15:43] pain and all these things he go up and
[1:15:45] pray and call on God say Jehovah God
[1:15:48] where's that deliverer Lord you said
[1:15:50] we're going to leave Lord where's that
[1:15:52] promise being fulfilled Lord where is it
[1:15:54] Lord and his wife in your your jokab bed
[1:15:56] said Abraham can you let someone else
[1:15:59] pray he said but what if someone doesn't
[1:16:02] Amen in his little Jewish heart there's
[1:16:04] a Burning Flame am mean he didn't want
[1:16:06] to draw back and say well we're just
[1:16:07] slaves and I guess if God wants to do it
[1:16:09] he'll do it and if not he won't no he
[1:16:11] saw the promise that was handed down and
[1:16:14] something in him said that promise is
[1:16:15] for me in my house am mean I want that
[1:16:18] promise fulfilled in my life Hallelujah
[1:16:20] so he pressed in until God God said
[1:16:23] angel with a sword draw said your prayer
[1:16:24] has been heard God's going to answer you
[1:16:27] the deliverer is going to be born and
[1:16:29] was born in his own home Hallelujah and
[1:16:32] I think we should pray in such a way
[1:16:34] Satan be bound in the name of Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ God move him power Lord there's
[1:16:39] people among us who don't know you in
[1:16:40] the power of your Resurrection Lord
[1:16:42] there's people who watch these Services
[1:16:43] don't know you in the power of your
[1:16:44] Resurrection go get them Lord I mean get
[1:16:47] our way with loved ones come down to
[1:16:48] camp and may there be no enemy be to
[1:16:51] withstand amen the power of our Christ
[1:16:53] because he can't but Lord may we come
[1:16:55] with clean Hearts pure Minds on fire for
[1:16:58] you loving you cuz we don't want to draw
[1:17:00] back and just go through the motions we
[1:17:02] want to push on Amen and have a closer
[1:17:04] walk with God if you want it he'll give
[1:17:06] it if you don't want it you won't get it
[1:17:08] but if you want it you'll get it amen
[1:17:10] and God's timing so I want it so I want
[1:17:12] to get it amen I think it's how we
[1:17:14] should be hallelujah amen amen so we
[1:17:17] should contend for nothing less than the
[1:17:20] full word of God manifested in our lives
[1:17:22] we should cont contend for nothing less
[1:17:24] than God dwelling in all of our souls
[1:17:26] amen the abiding presence of God that's
[1:17:28] what we should be contending
[1:17:30] for amen he says now truly Brethren
[1:17:32] might deserve a lot of criticisms
[1:17:34] they've made many mistakes that's all
[1:17:35] right but brother I'd rather be found on
[1:17:38] the battlefield making mistakes then are
[1:17:40] then be a criticizer of the man who's
[1:17:42] trying to get Soul Sav to God what are
[1:17:44] you doing about it I think that's a very
[1:17:46] good question amen let's not be
[1:17:49] criticizers let's be energizers amen
[1:17:52] let's push the battle
[1:17:54] hallelujah amen he is the same yesterday
[1:17:56] today and forever now we never want to
[1:17:58] take God to be common I'm going to get
[1:18:00] to Abraham soon we'll get there now
[1:18:03] friends let let's hear him the Holy
[1:18:05] Spirit speaking in our midst showing
[1:18:06] diverse miracles signs and wonders let's
[1:18:08] not pass over it like it's a common
[1:18:10] happenings let's remember that it's
[1:18:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:18:14] and forever confirming his word I mean
[1:18:17] we must do it oh please do it take heed
[1:18:19] let every other thing be secondary even
[1:18:21] your home your husband your wife your
[1:18:23] children whatever it may be put it
[1:18:25] second place God first you say brother
[1:18:27] Braham over my children over anything
[1:18:30] Place God first let him be first see
[1:18:33] this is an hour of
[1:18:34] entertainment we had to entertain
[1:18:36] ourselves as children we didn't have
[1:18:38] something to play with we made up a
[1:18:40] game in our backyard we in our front
[1:18:43] yard we had bike tracks where we would
[1:18:45] make racing we would race our bikes we
[1:18:47] would play games but we but my parents
[1:18:49] weren't constantly there saying
[1:18:51] entertaining us we entertained ourselves
[1:18:54] that's
[1:18:55] right you say I'm bored you know boredom
[1:18:58] is actually a birthplace of great
[1:19:01] ideas I've just gone off in a tangent
[1:19:04] but here we
[1:19:05] are you say I'm bored don't be bored
[1:19:07] life is too interesting to be bored the
[1:19:10] reason people get bored is they don't
[1:19:11] have an imagination about what they
[1:19:13] could do people get bored in church they
[1:19:15] don't have a vision about what God could
[1:19:17] do in them amen but if we really say
[1:19:19] Lord your word you are so alive I may
[1:19:21] sound like a broken rickle but hey the
[1:19:24] needle will move eventually right but
[1:19:26] you see now if God is God let's serve
[1:19:28] him if God is God let's serve him with
[1:19:30] all of our hearts if God is God let's
[1:19:32] give our all if God is God let's burn
[1:19:35] every bridge if God is God let's forget
[1:19:38] about fear of failure let's not be
[1:19:40] afraid to step out and actually do
[1:19:42] something for him oh I may get turned
[1:19:44] down who cares I may get rejected John
[1:19:46] Wesley did a lot brother Bram did amen
[1:19:49] all the all the True Believers down
[1:19:50] Through the Ages had a taste of re
[1:19:52] rection cuz Christ was rejected and the
[1:19:55] same cup he drank we
[1:19:57] drink amen so let's push on if God is
[1:20:00] God let's not be on the fence the devil
[1:20:02] is the fence Builder amen let's not sit
[1:20:05] on the let's serve him let's love him
[1:20:07] with all that we are amen let's give all
[1:20:09] that we have amen amen
[1:20:12] hallelujah amen it's not just given to
[1:20:15] us we've got to accept it you see now
[1:20:17] the Apostle Paul as he wrote the book of
[1:20:20] Hebrews he wasn't writing it out of just
[1:20:22] intellectual idea he was writing it out
[1:20:25] of a real out of a
[1:20:27] experience amen and the reason he could
[1:20:30] say let's not draw back as he had plenty
[1:20:32] of opportunity to draw back he could
[1:20:34] have just lived a quiet life somewhere
[1:20:36] just gone through the motions you know
[1:20:38] just joined a church someplace never
[1:20:39] preached once you know just joined a
[1:20:41] body of people you know he could have
[1:20:43] after his s first discouraging
[1:20:46] missionary trip he could have quit being
[1:20:47] a missionary saying well I guess God
[1:20:48] doesn't want me to imagine going to a
[1:20:50] place imagine if we were you know Chile
[1:20:52] let's go preach in that church we get
[1:20:54] stoned outside that church we go to
[1:20:56] another place we're in jail you know how
[1:20:58] would that report me but you see that's
[1:21:01] how the Apostle Paul feed he went to one
[1:21:03] place he got thrown out of that City
[1:21:06] great trouble he went to the next city
[1:21:08] those who threw him out of the first
[1:21:09] city followed him to the next city you'd
[1:21:11] like Believers to follow you he had
[1:21:12] unbelievers following him he ended up in
[1:21:14] prison had had all kinds of trouble he
[1:21:16] didn't draw back he could have used that
[1:21:18] just to draw back and say well if God is
[1:21:20] really God he would have kept me from
[1:21:21] all this trouble no he knew that God is
[1:21:23] in the trouble God is greater than the
[1:21:26] trouble God is greater than the
[1:21:27] persecution God is greater than the
[1:21:29] rejection the pain the Mis understand
[1:21:31] the questions that don't seem answered
[1:21:32] God is greater than those things and so
[1:21:34] he pushed he pressed on he didn't draw
[1:21:36] back amen and because look at this how
[1:21:39] he he's standing there speaking to King
[1:21:41] Agrippa and he says whereupon oh King
[1:21:43] Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the
[1:21:45] heavenly vision what a testimony to have
[1:21:50] he wasn't making that up he was not
[1:21:51] disobedient after he met met the Lord on
[1:21:53] the road to Damascus he was not
[1:21:55] disobedient to what he was told he had
[1:21:57] to do here we are friends we all have a
[1:22:00] role to play in the body of Christ are
[1:22:03] we fulfilling that role to 100% of our
[1:22:06] are we surrendered 100% that God can
[1:22:09] manifest what he's placed Us in the body
[1:22:11] to do are we or are we not I think we
[1:22:14] should be he say well people make fun of
[1:22:17] me who
[1:22:18] cares our reward doesn't come from
[1:22:21] people reward comes from Heaven amen our
[1:22:25] our see God is no man's deta right so so
[1:22:29] are we are we pulling back because of
[1:22:32] humanity or we pushing on because of God
[1:22:35] the Apostle Paul did not pull back
[1:22:37] because of humanity he had trouble and
[1:22:40] he even preached the people through
[1:22:42] Great Tribulation you'll enter into the
[1:22:43] kingdom of God and maybe they'd say Paul
[1:22:46] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:22:47] he' say okay I'm going to give you a
[1:22:48] testimony service of last week I was
[1:22:51] stoned that dragged my body out of the
[1:22:53] city somehow I they pray for me I got
[1:22:55] back up that's where I got the bruises
[1:22:57] from people I've experienced what I'm
[1:22:59] talking about Hallelujah but you see he
[1:23:02] lived in such a way because it so
[1:23:04] gripped him the God he read about the
[1:23:07] God he thought he knew was was alive but
[1:23:10] he wasn't the he wasn't the Pharisee no
[1:23:12] more of thinking I I'm the Pharisee of
[1:23:14] the Pharisees I believe he would have
[1:23:17] actually he wasn't just you know he he
[1:23:19] wasn't making that up when he said that
[1:23:21] he would have been the Pharisee the he
[1:23:22] would have been the who's who in the
[1:23:23] Bible school but he said I had to count
[1:23:25] that all but dang that I win Christ amen
[1:23:28] so he knew what it was like to be the
[1:23:30] Pharisee it's all about me but then he
[1:23:31] knew what it was like to realize who
[1:23:33] where God really is and give us life
[1:23:36] completely Amen to him so he was not
[1:23:38] disobedient un unto the heavenly vision
[1:23:41] I pray we're not disobedient to the
[1:23:43] heavenly vision pulling back because of
[1:23:45] family pressures of Life trouble
[1:23:47] misunderstandings pain whatever it is oh
[1:23:50] you don't know my upbringing God knows
[1:23:51] your upbringing
[1:23:53] God gave you your upbringing well I want
[1:23:55] I want a different one but he allowed
[1:23:57] you to have that one because he wanted
[1:23:59] to mold the character into you am mean
[1:24:01] that God can use your past amen for a
[1:24:04] victory amen hallelujah well I've missed
[1:24:07] out on so much on life God knows what
[1:24:09] that's all vine see that see now let's
[1:24:12] just jump here because I think we're
[1:24:13] running out of time
[1:24:16] now we're going to come to I'm just
[1:24:18] going to make a Quantum Leap and jump to
[1:24:20] Abraham because I want to speak about
[1:24:21] this for a while see now after these
[1:24:23] things the word of the Lord came unto
[1:24:24] Abraham in a vision saying fear not
[1:24:25] Abraham I am thy shield and thy
[1:24:27] exceeding great reward now that after
[1:24:30] these things is after the battle with
[1:24:32] the Kings and he meets mesc brother Adam
[1:24:34] says it's after he wrestled it's it's
[1:24:36] when you after you wrestle it out with
[1:24:38] God and fully surrender then he serves
[1:24:41] you the communion I mean gives you his
[1:24:43] Spirit when you when you whip this guy
[1:24:45] out it's not the devil that see the
[1:24:47] devil's conquered you know that he was
[1:24:49] defeated on Calvary so public Enemy

[1:24:56] am the one who gets in God's way I'm the
[1:24:58] one that frustrates him I'm the one that
[1:25:00] hinders his work I'm the one that stops
[1:25:02] him doing what he wants to do me me this
[1:25:06] guy if I can get this guy out of the way
[1:25:09] he can do things I know nothing about
[1:25:11] where maybe I've only read it but it
[1:25:12] becomes so alive where it's just a maybe
[1:25:14] a nice idea or wouldn't that be need if
[1:25:16] it happens it is no longer an
[1:25:17] imagination it becomes a reality if I
[1:25:20] can get this guy out of the way if I can
[1:25:22] reckon this man dead it's no longer I
[1:25:25] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:25:27] all fear of failure would be gone all
[1:25:30] all popularity would be you worry about
[1:25:32] po that' be gone all cares of life would
[1:25:34] be put to the side and would push on
[1:25:36] like never before I'm talking about
[1:25:38] myself you see so Abraham after those
[1:25:41] things the Lord came to him and said I
[1:25:43] am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:25:45] reward see so the Lord had already made
[1:25:48] him but now he's going to say look I'm
[1:25:49] your Shield keep walking with me Abraham
[1:25:52] I'm going to fulfill the word that I
[1:25:54] said to you that I will fulfill amen see
[1:25:57] Abraham didn't shrink back he pushed in
[1:26:00] he believed God he staggered not at the
[1:26:02] promise of God through unbelief was
[1:26:03] giving praise unto God that he was more
[1:26:05] than able to do that which he had
[1:26:07] promised I mean so God is telling him
[1:26:09] I'm your Shield Hallelujah I want that
[1:26:12] kind of armor on the front top back I
[1:26:15] want to have the full armor of God the
[1:26:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost I want I don't
[1:26:19] want my reasoning to be my shield I
[1:26:20] don't want a comfort zone to be my
[1:26:22] shield I don't want to be a little
[1:26:23] cuddle hole hiding away no I want him to
[1:26:26] be my shield I mean that when the enemy
[1:26:28] comes against me I'm not hiding in some
[1:26:30] bunker somewhere pulling back but I'm
[1:26:32] pushing
[1:26:33] on see there's a saying that a cow dies
[1:26:36] a million times but a hero Never
[1:26:38] Dies amen and there's another saying
[1:26:41] that you know a quitter never wins but a
[1:26:43] winner never quits you know Abraham
[1:26:45] Lincoln would stand for public office
[1:26:47] about 11 times the 11th time he became
[1:26:50] president he didn't quit something in
[1:26:52] him was driving him to become president
[1:26:55] of the United States because we know he
[1:26:57] is part of the Emancipation the
[1:26:59] proclamation getting the slaves free
[1:27:00] he's all part of a great plan of God for
[1:27:02] a liberation of a people now if that's
[1:27:05] just a man in a just a political office
[1:27:07] how much more a people ordained by God
[1:27:09] am me to fulfill his word how much more
[1:27:12] people that are called by God kept by
[1:27:14] God they're walking with God I mean to
[1:27:16] fulfill his great Plan of Redemption in
[1:27:19] this end time how much more that there
[1:27:21] should be fire burning in our souls Lord
[1:27:24] I want more of you I want to see a soul
[1:27:26] lord can I be a witness even just a
[1:27:28] little bit to someone Lord can people
[1:27:30] see my life and see a difference not
[1:27:32] maybe by the clothes I wear but more
[1:27:34] than that maybe how I speak how I
[1:27:36] conduct myself Lord may they see you may
[1:27:39] they have a question mark what there's
[1:27:41] something about that person oh yes

[1:27:59] you're from tell me where you're going
[1:28:01] that's how we should be I say Lord help

[1:28:08] amen hallelujah amen so he is thy Shield
[1:28:12] an exceeding great reward now brother
[1:28:15] Braham says this I've been through
[1:28:17] depression I don't know if you can read
[1:28:18] it there I've been through depression
[1:28:20] I've been through Prosperity I've seen
[1:28:21] it all together but I wouldn't turn
[1:28:23] loose the hand of Jesus Christ for all
[1:28:25] the money and the wealth that you could
[1:28:26] pile on the face of this Earth and
[1:28:28] everything else he's my friend when I'm
[1:28:30] broke he's my friend when I got plenty I
[1:28:32] love him when I'm hungry I love him when
[1:28:34] I'm filled I love him when I'm in sorrow

[1:28:38] because I love him because he first
[1:28:40] loved me amen hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:28:43] when I was sick laying dying he was my
[1:28:45] friend when I'm feeling good tonight
[1:28:47] happy he's still my friend when I'm
[1:28:49] laying Yonder dying somewhere my chilly
[1:28:51] veins coming up my my arms like that
[1:28:52] he'll be my friend then yeah and when
[1:28:54] those brittle threads that I'm walking
[1:28:56] on braks and I plunge out into eternity
[1:28:59] he'll be my friend then when the angel

[1:29:13] roll on oh how we ought to love him how
[1:29:16] we ought to give our all to him amen
[1:29:19] amen so this is how see this is how we
[1:29:20] be if we realize he's our friend in
[1:29:22] every circumstance our Focus will be on
[1:29:24] him and not upon ourselves
[1:29:27] hallelujah amen now Abraham was the kind
[1:29:30] of guy who couldn't go
[1:29:32] back it says in Hebrews now just in
[1:29:34] verse 15 he says truly if they had been
[1:29:37] mindful out of that country from which
[1:29:38] they came out of they might have had the
[1:29:40] opportunity to have returned now that
[1:29:43] word mindful means to exercise memory
[1:29:45] that is to rec by implic and then and
[1:29:47] then but it actually brings an
[1:29:48] implication of a punishment so to be
[1:29:51] mindful of you came out of is actually
[1:29:52] to keep thinking on it keep entertaining
[1:29:55] it this is what I once was and not in a
[1:29:57] way of thank God I'm not there anymore
[1:29:59] this is man I was something when I was
[1:30:01] back there that's a delusion of grandeur
[1:30:04] again see so we so we shouldn't be we
[1:30:06] should not meditate on what we came out
[1:30:08] of cuz the devil will twist it as an and
[1:30:11] make you look at it in the positive
[1:30:13] light and what does that bring it brings
[1:30:16] a
[1:30:17] punishment what would you rather have
[1:30:19] faith or
[1:30:20] unbelief both have both have a policy
[1:30:23] you brother talks about eternal life
[1:30:25] policy you know there's you know
[1:30:27] policies have have have fine print they
[1:30:30] have
[1:30:31] benefits let's just look at the two and
[1:30:34] now this list is not exhaustive but
[1:30:36] there' be many more than this what is
[1:30:37] unbelief bring anyone no
[1:30:41] hope everyone dies everyone will die
[1:30:45] where do you
[1:30:47] go no satisfaction there's no lasting
[1:30:50] satisfaction in sin yeah people jump
[1:30:53] from one thing to another to another but
[1:30:55] at the end there's no satisfaction
[1:30:57] there's no peace there's no lasting Joy
[1:31:00] there's no love there's no real identity
[1:31:04] that's right you get mind battle after
[1:31:06] mind battle there's no answer to the
[1:31:07] Mind battle you get more complexes you
[1:31:10] get more pain this is unbelief now who
[1:31:12] wants to sign up for this I'm trying to
[1:31:13] sell something no I'm not you know but
[1:31:16] if I was an honest unbelief
[1:31:18] salesman oh people will think you're
[1:31:19] cool but for a season yeah where's it
[1:31:22] going to be when you're lying on your
[1:31:23] bed at night do you have peace does he
[1:31:26] you know Michael Jackson overdosed on
[1:31:29] drugs he couldn't get he's just trying
[1:31:30] to get a wink of
[1:31:32] sleep he was the King of Pop but look
[1:31:35] where it led him I feel sorry for the
[1:31:36] man ala's presle the same way many have
[1:31:39] just overdosed on drugs because they're
[1:31:41] trying to get sleep they're trying to
[1:31:43] quiet that tormented Soul that's what
[1:31:46] unbelief does has it helped
[1:31:49] anyone what does faith do we could maybe
[1:31:52] make the list a lot more but I just want
[1:31:53] you to think about it because see the
[1:31:54] devil will try and get you to draw back
[1:31:56] try and make you Retreat stealthily look
[1:31:58] I'll give you something better this
[1:32:00] doesn't look this doesn't do anything
[1:32:02] for anyone and I've asked the question
[1:32:04] many times before those who came out of
[1:32:06] the world why didn't we just go back
[1:32:07] into the world why do we why do we
[1:32:09] become Believers if the world is so
[1:32:11] awesome if the world is so
[1:32:14] great well it's not great that's why
[1:32:16] we're here I'm glad we're not there I
[1:32:18] don't want to I don't I I don't want to
[1:32:20] go back to that stuff
[1:32:22] praise God but you see now now what does
[1:32:24] faith do see you you got to choose
[1:32:27] one see what does unbelief do give you a
[1:32:31] formal dead religion that doesn't help
[1:32:33] anyone what does faith do give you the
[1:32:35] love of God give you peace that passes
[1:32:38] all understanding amen gives you Joy
[1:32:41] gives you peace in your soul amen clears
[1:32:44] your mind gives you Clarity of thought
[1:32:47] amen calms your nerves amen comforts you
[1:32:49] when you're hurting amen amen rejoices
[1:32:52] with you when you're happy amen looks up
[1:32:55] guides you through life this is what
[1:32:57] faith does who wants it I know you've
[1:33:00] already got it but but who wants you
[1:33:01] we're going to look at the policies here
[1:33:03] amen it will save you when you're dying
[1:33:06] it'll stop you lying it'll send the
[1:33:08] Devils flying it's good enough for me
[1:33:10] Hallelujah it'll take you in a Rapture I
[1:33:12] think that's a good deal amen and
[1:33:14] there's no payment you got to give you
[1:33:16] just got to give your life but you know
[1:33:17] there there's no you don't earn it you
[1:33:19] got to accept it
[1:33:22] so I'd rather take I'd rather choose
[1:33:24] Faith than choose
[1:33:26] unbelief amen but if you choose unbelief
[1:33:28] it causes you to draw back if you choose
[1:33:30] Faith you push on Amen what does faith
[1:33:33] give you lifts Jesus out of History into
[1:33:35] your life I think that's a real good
[1:33:37] thing Hallelujah
[1:33:39] now he is thy shield and thy exceedingly
[1:33:43] great reward so here's Abraham he
[1:33:47] doesn't pull back he says I'm going to
[1:33:48] fulfill the word in your life and I'm
[1:33:50] your reward yeah sure there's other
[1:33:53] nations and all these people doing these

[1:35:56] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:35:58] Saints amen amen praise the Lord maybe
[1:36:02] yeah I feel like I'm going to go in a
[1:36:03] different direction so let's just let's
[1:36:05] just finish it there I pray no I I'm I'm
[1:36:09] actually going to finish with this now
[1:36:12] he goes away this is the this is the
[1:36:13] Israelite worshiper taking the lamb okay
[1:36:16] because we can start off on fire and we
[1:36:18] can end up pull back right we we want to
[1:36:22] start on fire and keep on fire the devil
[1:36:26] wants us to pull back cuz he has a b
[1:36:29] idea of what you're capable of remember
[1:36:32] he faced God from Heaven all the way
[1:36:35] down to now he got defe he got kicked
[1:36:37] out of heaven amen he's been defeated
[1:36:40] all the way down Through the Ages he
[1:36:42] knows what the H what God is capable of
[1:36:45] he was there in the book of Acts he was
[1:36:47] there in brother braham's meetings he
[1:36:49] was kicked out service after service
[1:36:50] prayer L after prayer line and that same
[1:36:53] God that kicked him out there is the
[1:36:54] same God that lives in you and I so so
[1:36:56] he doesn't want us to be on fire he
[1:36:59] wants us to be to to pull back now he
[1:37:02] goes away this done he's done Jehovah's
[1:37:04] bidding so he goes away feeling
[1:37:06] Justified because he's answered answered
[1:37:08] Jehovah's request he's done what Jehovah
[1:37:10] said do then he feels that he's by faith
[1:37:13] he's took God at his word and now listen
[1:37:15] real close now he took God at his word
[1:37:17] he is sincere in doing what he did he
[1:37:20] did it sincerely by the word no matter
[1:37:23] who laughed at him see his heart was in
[1:37:25] it see if your heart is in it amen then
[1:37:28] you're not pulling back cuz you're
[1:37:30] sincerely Lord I want you more who's who
[1:37:33] knows what I mean amen amen he did it
[1:37:35] anyhow because it was God's requirement
[1:37:37] and now that was wonderful that he
[1:37:39] knowed he was justified he could feel
[1:37:42] that way because he met je the
[1:37:43] requirements of Jehovah that would be
[1:37:45] the word met the requirements of that of
[1:37:47] what the word of God required him to do
[1:37:49] for his justification
[1:37:51] now finally it was wonderful to begin
[1:37:54] with but finally it became a family
[1:37:57] tradition I'm sure you know what I mean
[1:38:00] the Jew would offer a sacrifice just
[1:38:01] because that well the family did it and
[1:38:03] well it was a tradition and when he
[1:38:05] walked up he said wait a minute I
[1:38:07] believe I've sinned I see that's all
[1:38:09] right well I'll get me a lamb and go up
[1:38:11] and there was just no Godly sorrow for a
[1:38:13] sin it was only a ritual just a
[1:38:16] ritualistic form of taking his animal
[1:38:18] for offering he never got nothing out of
[1:38:20] it because he never put nothing in it
[1:38:23] yet he was obeying the commission of God
[1:38:25] by his by his word but he didn't come in
[1:38:28] with the real meaning of his word he was
[1:38:30] obeying as far as being fundamentally he
[1:38:32] obeyed it but sincerely he didn't obey
[1:38:35] it therefore it was just a ritual
[1:38:36] following a
[1:38:39] tradition that is someone who has pulled
[1:38:41] back well I go to church because I go to
[1:38:44] church I come because it's expected of
[1:38:46] me well I got to be the head of my home
[1:38:48] so I need to pray because it's expected
[1:38:50] of me or I'm the wife so I'm a certain
[1:38:52] way or you know because it's expected of
[1:38:54] me we shouldn't do things because it's
[1:38:56] expected of us we should live him
[1:38:58] because we love him am mean we want him
[1:39:01] more of him we want to praise him
[1:39:02] because of out of a thankful heart am
[1:39:04] mean that when we come we realize we've
[1:39:06] sinned right we say Lord forgive me of
[1:39:09] my sins wash me in your blood see at
[1:39:11] first it can be a real heartfelt and it
[1:39:13] should be a Godly sorrow Lord I'm so
[1:39:16] wrong I'm so sorry Lord Wash Me cleanse
[1:39:19] me but it can turn into just a prayer
[1:39:22] well your heart's not in anymore sure it
[1:39:24] may be emotional but if your heart's not
[1:39:25] in what you're doing it's just a
[1:39:28] tradition friends let's not be like
[1:39:30] this I'm not saying we are but let's not
[1:39:33] be like this let's let's let's stay away
[1:39:34] from a tradition am mean of just going
[1:39:37] through the motions but let's push on
[1:39:39] and out of a real Godly sincerity and
[1:39:41] love for him Lord here I am I don't want
[1:39:44] to pull back I want to push on Lord I
[1:39:47] want to go beyond my comfort zone of my
