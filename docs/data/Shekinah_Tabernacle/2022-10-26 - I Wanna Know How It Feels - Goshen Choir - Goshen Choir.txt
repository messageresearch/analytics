========================================

[Music] thank you [Music] my mom and daddy talked about going home since I was just a babe on their knees they said that nothing compares to what was waiting up there how one day we would finally be free well I've never seen it but I'll keep on believing it will be a place like I've never known I'll keep my eyes on the sky cause my soul wants to fly Lord my heart is already gone [Music] know how it feels to have a talk with the Saints [Music] [Music] sometimes I get weary from this life that I live it seems that he says something I'll never find I try to lighten my Lord but all that I've got to show is 700 things on my mind well I'm seeing visions of a crystal clear River where since forgotten Without a Trace [Applause] [Music] I wanna know how it feels [Music] how it feels [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] to make my way down the streets above [Music] the river [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I know that it's real I wanna know how it feels [Applause]
