[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] brother Chris is here so we can start I was good to see you all here tonight thank you for making the effort to come out and set aside a night of our week to gather together end be in the presence of God and to be enriched and to further [Music] learn our way through the unseen you know as Christians we sometimes think oh you know we just sometimes it feels like we just go to church and home and we maybe there might not be a lot happening but every week we're learning about the unseen we're learning about the unseen realm where people think there's nothing in that but maybe we and everything's going to right it doesn't matter but when things don't go right when you know your way through the unseen that's such a blessing when you get when you hit hardship and these unseen things start to affect you and it just thoughts come and everything comes we if you know your way through it you can coast through it easily that's why people have midlife crisis and the drastic thing will happen and they their life falls apart because they they haven't dealt with the unseen they've only dealt with the seen and what they do and everything and when these when these thoughts come and they hit these times they don't know how to make their way through it but as Christians we came here and we learn about the unseen and learn how to navigate through it and it's faith you know you can't see but you believe and you just know by faith this is the direction I'd hidden by faith this is the way I go and as you trust in the Lord more and more it becomes easier and easier just to have faith and say Lord this it doesn't matter what it looks like this is the way it will be the Word of God saves us this is the way it will be and it's so I pray oh I think we'll be in for another blessing tonight amen brother Andy said to me on Monday he said I'm going under the pillar of fire tonight what what are you

prayer Lord Jesus we thank you that we can be here again this evening and to learn more about you bought into as as Paul said a little way we look not to the things that are seen but the things that are unseen for the things that are seen the temporal but the things that are unseen are eternal Lord and we want to look at the unseen things this evening Lord and may our minds switch on to that and may we receive all that you have for us Lord may we look through spiritual eyes and just receive all that you have may we just put off all the natural things with this life just for a while and sit at your feet Lord and learn from you this evening we just come at the service to your hands lord I pray please brother Angie's here ministers bless them for the effort the work that he's made and to put

good to hear the music I praise the Lord amen tonight we're going to speak on healing by spiritual medicine amen hallelujah he's so glad for spiritual medicine I'm so thankful and so happy that we have spiritual medicine amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so we'll just carry on now and so we're just read here in Ephesians 4 21 to 23 I think we've pretty well familiar with this we could probably turn that off and read it by memory but that's alright that's good actually if so be that you have heard him hallelujah amen I've heard him and I hear him and I speak with him and I have a conversation with him and I I constantly hear from the Lord amen and I hear him through ministry I hear him personally I hear him through song he speaks his voice is heard and the all the earth his voice is being spoken now but as what we do with that voice and what we do with what we hear how we act upon it and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus and the truth shall make you free Amen that you put off you put off don't wait for some miraculous revelation all the time God can give those things but he doesn't have to all the time and he won't all the time he wants you to put it off he wants to show you what's wrong and then you do you you act upon it and then you'll get the understanding and revelation about what you were actually imprisoned by you know and it's because God does things sometimes by miracle and sometimes he heals by medicine so that you put off concerning the former conversation the manner of life the way it used to be the old culture the old things that you did and your fathers did and whatever outside of Christ put it off that old man that ol nature the old things is going to kill you which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind amen hallelujah may the Lord had his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated god bless you it's good to be here amen hallelujah life and death are in the power of the tongue and they that rule it shall eat the fruits thereof proverbs 18:21 now that's a very striking Scripture life and death you know we eat life and death are in the power of the tongue there's a that puts a lot of weight on this little piece of muscle you know and it's not really the muscle in the movements and all of that and learning how to talk it's the concept that's the power of the what you're speaking and that power there's different levels of that power the first level is the power if you speak the word that's got God's Spirit in it now we're Network it spoken by the anointing and in season and under an inspiration and even if you just speak that word in faith to yourself or to others however there is a power contained in that word he said my words are spirit and they are life so there is power and network but then there's also another type of power in the tongue and that is when you speak positively and you are constantly talking good about people and just speaking positively there's a power on a natural level as well that's going to help you it's going to help your subconscious it's going to help your spirit it's going to help your memories and your affections and all those things are going to get washed by a positive speech by uncorrupt communication coming out of your mouth you know and and so that's why there is life and the power of the tongue but there's also death and that can cause a lot of trouble when you start to take things and start speaking things over this tongue that aren't good that are negative that aren't the will of God you know and you start taking things and mixing them together and and and using your tongue as a weapon for the for the enemy well and so this tongue what drives the tongue is a spirit yeah what's behind that tongue what's behind what that tongue saying what's the mode of an objective of what that tongue is saying and so you take it right back now we're not going to this whole session is not going to be about the tongue but I just wanted to show you that there is a lot of power in this little helm of this tongue that directs you know you've got this giant big Titanic ship huge big ships and they get turned by these little parts you know I don't know how big they are but they're not that they're not really in relativity to the size of the ship they're very small I don't know very small a meter maybe what size is the rudder on an inter islander Wow and they that rule it shall eat the fruits thereof aren't you so glad that you know when you can get the mastery when you can get when you can start to utilize your dominion over your spirit amen when your spirit stops controlling you and you can start controlling your spirit because you've been given that dominion and you can start you can recognize your position and the Lord can start healing you and doing things in your life so that you can actually get rulership over this time because it's possible now it's not by your own strength either man it's actually by the Holy Spirit without the Holy Spirit you will never get control of that tongue that tongue will just destroy your life and they that rule it shall eat the fruits thereof amen what are the fruits love joy peace longsuffering goodness temperance meekness and the fruits of the spirit this fruits in there is other fruits you know there's fruits of bringing forth children to the Lord speaking words of in season I think in some know Isaiah 50 it says that you've given me the tongue of the Loon that I may know how to speak a word that is in season to him that is weary amen and so there is a lot of power that's invested in this tongue and life and death so the one extreme to the other the very whole reason we're here is to choose between life and death and it hinges on this little helm that's going to steer your ship in a certain direction and life it's going to steer your ship now you've got to discern now what spirit is driving this tongue amen hallelujah I'm not going to go too far into this because I want to talk about it later because it's such an amazing verse Philemon 1:6 and it says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual now when something says the communication of your faith may become effectual now that's going to turn faith into something that's virtuous something that's got power something that's going to happen it's going to be effectual it's going to have an effect so you know you're it's because you've all been given faith right and I said I wasn't going to go into it now but I just can't help it but you've been given faith everyone a measure of faith now you don't want to keep that just buried down and like you know under under restraint by all the enemies that it's been placed on site because you know like Israel got placed in a promised land there's like faith right it got placed in the in the land and right around everyone the whole thing came Confederate against them everyone was against them and they'd been built up for 400 years to resist them and everything was against them and against all odds they took it because God was with him but you see now that faith can be just dormant and it's sit there and do nothing because it's can being shrouded by fears complexes demons all sorts of things that can enshroud their faith and stop it from doing anything complexes in and and end bruises and scars and actual real ruptures and people's spirits that will keep that faith from becoming effectual and now the powerful part of this and it's so simple and so elementary and so practical and so easy and yet it's not easy because it becomes it's not just a quick fix it's a it's a lifestyle change it's a lifestyle that reflects the word and it's not legalism it's actually it's realism it this has to happen it has to happen and it will happen by the grace of God he will help you he'll help me I need help when I read these things that I don't I haven't got it all I don't know how to do all of the stuff and I don't practice it completely perfectly all the time but I I need the grace of God I need the Lord to help me live this life I need his grace I depend on him amen yeah Alleluia so the acknowledging now here it is your faith is going to become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you you've got to acknowledge it you've got to recognize it recognize who you are recognized what's within you recognize what Jesus has invested in you in Christ Jesus of course not in you and your flesh but in you in Christ Jesus what Jesus has laid in the soil of your life amen and I've said it a few times you know like there you want to dig down some times and find out you know there's that you know in your hearts like in the soil in its fertile soil in and he's placed a lot of seed in there and there's a lot of harvest to get to come forth and something you know when you hear the word here preaching and then you get a revelation it's like you know the ministry just comes in here and they dig out a gym and they polish it up and they were and und in you realize wow it was already in me I already had this amen now brother Branham says this because you'll see now how much your physical body and and your thoughts and what they can do to stop you from actually perceiving reality by negative mindsets and where those negative Minds it's how the devil can come in and possess your life through those negative mindsets and blind you to reality blind you completely to reality and you can reject everything by just having negative mind a negative physical mind and so he says here brother as it was in that case so as the many a hypo needle stops the deathbed confection confession oh she thought she was right but when it came the time to die even a backslidden pastor had got around she was all right she sure she was a good member of the church and she paid into the church and she was a pianist in the church and what more what more could she do intellectually she was thinking she was right but when it came to a place you remember your mind is it's governed by the blood cells by the brain cells remember neuroplasticity and that's a big word for us you know but the mind and what you think all the time and what you practice and what becomes your manner of life it actually forges physical or electrical neuro patterns in your brain and news and it becomes easy to do that all the time and it's a default setting and your mind and your brain physically speaking now now here he says here that your mind is governed by these things it's governed by these brain cells and so that becomes a big problem if it's who's now here's this lady and she's been in church and she's doing all these religious practices and she wants to be right and she's been told lies by her pastor because they let them go because they just put money in the offering plate and whatever they do huh but anyway she was completely blind because real ministers that she came from and all of that that would come to her and tell her the truth she would refuse it but as we're going to read and then when them blood cease when them blood cease to function to those brain cells and then the mind begin to the intellectual part begin to die out of the woman and when it began to die out and she begin to see see that that mind that have been twisted into a certain way all the time when that started to fade away yeah the reality started coming now you know we really we pray that this reality comes to us before we get to that stage Amen Alleluia because you know that's the grace of God only the grace of God can show us that we can begin to see before our physical brain has to die but yet you see you've got to choose for that physical brain to die you've got to choose for all those mindsets and all those things that you used to enjoy and all the things that you used to love and those things that you got entertainment from is so used to a passive entertainment lifestyle that you don't even have to sit down and energy do anything you know and that really has to die now you've got to take a choice now over your you you the soul you've been given a choice now you can choose now I'm gonna I want to die to those things I don't want them anymore they don't need to be in my life then you'll begin to see really see waking up out of sleep when that this spirit down here in her heart which is her soul went toward God death means separate and if you sin just believe wilfully after the Gospels been presented to you that soul nature of yours will gradually move away from you and you'll feel it no more just wrought away you won't not that we just want to carry on you say well I know I believe I'm right that's what's the matter with Michigan tonight that's what's the with the matter with Indiana tonight that's what's the matter with the world tonight they have been smothered to sleep by petit Hollywood impersonation of Christianity what we need today is the old-fashioned Hellfire brimstone preachers back in the pulpit again to preach the truth write a Hell for sinners and accept the man be born again he will have no eyes into the kingdom now this whole fort of hell fire brimstone preachers some guy that's angry and just rough that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a man of conviction that preaches the truth and then the truth is the truth and and it's not in hate or is not an anger it's not just this whole one minded thing you're going to go to hell and repeat no it's the truth it's but it's actually pinpointing things so that you can make a real decision we're so privileged to what we're here we are the most privileged people on the earth that we can sit under ministry and we can sit under this message that has it's got a hell for sinners and accept the man be born again he shall in no wise into the kingdom not all you might go the Swale that way no you must be born again it must happen amen and really the truth shall make you free the truth amen amen shall make you free I miss something me on on a minute praise go on a raid here now we see that we see that influence and we can see that thoughts now and we've studied it over the last many parts that thoughts change your brain cells they change the makeup of you they change what the way you are by your thinking your thoughts have a lot of power and a lot of push inside your complex ecosystem inside you that makes up you all right and so here we're going to just hit a bit of medical side now and I'm going to show you and just this just let this make you recognize the the privilege you have that you know this stuff is only new discovery it says here now this is new discovery in science but we've been we've actually been exposed to this for a long time see the Bible has been teaching these things for 2,000 you actually longer all the way back from the Garden of Eden the Lord's been teaching these things and these principles have been laid out in the scriptures all the way and all the time and God's shown in all the lives of the Old Testament and then he brought it out in the message of the hour through the Prophet now just giving instruction of these things and now these guys are now coming to see it and we're very privileged to know that these things are very they're very normal for us gene activity can change according to perception according to doctor Bruce Lipton gene activity can change on a daily basis if the perception in your mind is reflected in the chemistry of your body and if your nervous system reads and interprets the environment and then controls the Bloods chemistry so what you perceive that's happening around you what you think now if you've got a clean mind and God healed you and you're not full of complexes or demon powers and things you're going to perceive things the way they really are you're going to catch what's really happening and discern it by the word but you see now there's in digest your perception after your perceptions negative and it's based on all these complexes and things that's happened and it's all about other people and blame and all those things your perception and most of 60% of humans was like there may be more outside of Christianity probably almost everybody you know there's very few people that aren't so complicated and they can't you can't actually you know they just push things around it says here that but then now your perception of that's going to control the physical makeup of your body so it's how you interpret the environment and then controls the blood chemistry then you can literally change the fate of your cells by altering your thoughts in fact up the Lipton's research illustrates now before this whole article I was reading the research was above so all of the things that they had gone through in the experiments but I didn't want to bring that out because you know we know we already know that this stuff is actually true but it's actually a really good synopsis of what I'm going through into so I thought I'd read it and it also makes you appreciate the Bible and appreciate the message of the hour that's already preaching these things without an actual education what see brother Branham had a divine education amen hallelujah we've got a divine education amen hallelujah I'm so glad for that in fact up the Lipton's research illustrates that by changing your perception your mind can alter the activity of your genes and create over 30,000 variations of product from each gene I don't know what that means to be honest but P but i but you can see what I'm talking about here there is of your mind and your thoughts whether they're positive or negative what's coming out of your tongue and what's motivating your tongue has got a very big influence on your physical well-being on the balance of your body on your mood swings and on your on your perception of reality amen what you're thinking so you can see now when you can start thinking on the word and I'm going to give you some tools later on in the service on how to overcome specific things and now I don't say that I'm going to cover everything but we'll just cover a few things to show you and then you'll get the drift and then I pray that you put it into practice I pray that you diagnose and put it into practice and actually start doing it because these things sometimes God will heal by miracle and then sometimes God will miraculously healed by medicine he'll take you through things and he'll teach you stuff and he'll want you to express your Dominion because he's teaching you how to rule and reign he's going to teach you how to become a good leader and he will start your leadership role in your own life how you're going to lead your spirit how you're going to lead your flesh and leave it and leader a part of you that is revolting all the time that doesn't really want to be led properly but when it can actually come into a balance it becomes happily dormant because it doesn't want it's not upset you know but when your flesh is all upset and it's not happily dormant it's going to it's going to overcome you and it's going to overwhelm you and all those emotions and all those things are going to rise up and it's going to become too much but if now these thoughts now that can change genetics contain within the nucleus of the cell and you can rewrite those genetic programs through changing your blood chemistry what changes your blood chemistry your thoughts your thinking now these guys have done experiments to find to actually see this happen in the simplest terms and I like that when I read that I was like I'm good I can understand something there this means that we need to change the way we think if we are to heal cancer now remember these guys don't understand about divine healing it's not us that heals it it's actually God on us there's the God's life in us right and our faith in the word but these people in doctors and medical have seen people that have positive thinking get over all sorts so you see but they don't understand that God made their body God breathe that breath of life into them even as corrupt as it is and how much it's been soiled by the human race and Satan and all that it still has the power in it to do things to accomplish stuff so how much more the Holy Ghost how much more a life that's coming to you can actually when you start thinking on those four the wavelength of those thoughts goes skyrocket us through the roof and what these guys even delving into skyrocket those thoughts there's power in the form of God and you let that thought come into your mind and you think on that you start speaking that you start confessing that you start singing that whatever it may be God puts it on your heart but you see the change amen says the function of the mind is to create coherence between our beliefs and the reality we experience dr. Lipton says what that means is that your mind will adjust the body's biology and behavior to fit with your beliefs my if you've been told you'll die in six months and your mind believes it you'll most likely will die in six months yeah that's called nocebo effect the result of a negative thought I mean this the only reason I put this up because it just synopsize a good synopsis of what we've been going through which is the opposite of the placebo effect where healing is mediated by a positive thought my you really get what I mean you know thoughts yeah I mean you type in what is a thought and you don't they don't even know because it's and we know what a thought is that's actually God God gave us those thoughts you know that's the Word of God it's the it's actually general thought is generated by the nature of God or the nature of Satan it's two powers on this earth and there's good thoughts and then there's evil thoughts it's only two really so any thought that you think it can be traced back with a how far you need to go back to - yeah that's it amen amen my so you see thought is powerful now when you can catch God's thought catch the concept that God has revealed there is great power in that the dynamic points to a three-party system is the part of you that swears it doesn't want to die the conscious mind trumped by the part that believes you will the doctor's prognosis mediated by the subconscious mind you see now in the doctor comes and tells you you're going to die you got six months prepare there's nothing we can do all those fears and whatever movies you've watched it if you've seen in all those things and traumas and stuff that you've gone through in your life and the emotions it all just comes and overwhelms what is it doing because in that same subconscious as that seed of faith and it's to all those enemies that Amalekites Confederate together hallelujah sorry I just have to say they Confederate together and all that fear and all that fear mongering and all those complexes and they just try and that faith and they're pushing it down hallelujah but you know what happens when when you know that faith you know when it goes under pressure hallelujah it just performs better amen hallelujah you cannot crush faith hallelujah no matter what you do you cannot crush faith because if God placed it faith Alleluia something's going to something's going to give amen something's going to give I believe that a real faith that's why you see you know the syrophoenician woman that the disciples rejected her the demons were tormenting her and all of whatever was wrong and everything is going wrong in her life and even Jesus called her a doll yeah hallelujah but she did not give up Amen no matter what people did or what anything there was nothing that could stop because there was faith inside there no matter what happened no matter who rejected her no matter what people called her a do to no matter how much she thought it was wrong about something deep down was just just had to get that amen and faith was never destroyed faith fail not Amen Alleluia amen and so you can be criticized you can be ostracized you can be kidding you can be so hard done by by a message church you know and people have been and a lot of people have left and gone maybe there was nothing there and then there's a lot of people that stayed and I continued on there was nothing that the pastor can say wrong that will keep kick them make them go well they talk to me no nothing they just keep very oh no they say oh well you know maybe the Lord needs to help them a little bit or whatever the pastor's a bit mad at me or he doesn't understand or whatever or you just need to move on or what I don't know I mean this is not for us but this is just a general comment but this has happened now what I'm trying to say is that faith will not be deterred like by anything that man can do or anything that Satan can do it's going to conquer hallelujah amen but you see still in that subconscious now that's where the war is all taking place and so you see now the conscious mind he's saying here is trumped by this subconscious mind because the conscious mind is 5% of your spirit and the subconscious is 95% so you can see there's a lot more influence that your subconscious head and this is what really generated my interest in this whole subject was if there's so much influence in your life by your subconscious and then brother Brandon says everything is actually in there your faith is in there your soul is actually nested inside your subconscious because it goes sole subconscious and then body you know it's actually all of its nested inside there and then it grows from in there and pushes and comes in to conquer it comes to dominate it comes into its Dominion from within the land God places you within the land and then he asks you to now go tour them take it and see and you see now ratsy brother Bram says that when you get the Holy Ghost says it's God's life now comes and is blending with your life and eventually all that little darkness and things that's actually that's why it's so important we need the Holy Ghost because if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's just going to stake that listen yeah but when the Holy Ghost comes in it's like a light comes on and it just blends over now you don't lose your identity because you are you and God made you thus but all the darkness that's in your diet entity starts to fade away it starts to leave and it happens amen life anyway the doctor's prognosis mediated by the subconscious mind which then throws in together chemical reaction mediated by the brains chemistry so this is probably quite complicated but I just didn't want to really understand everything that's going on in here but just the main floor here to make sure the body conforms to the dominant belief neuroscience is recognized that the subconscious controls 95% of our lives now what about the part that doesn't want to die the conscious mind isn't it impacting the body's chemistry as well dr. Lipton says that it comes down to how the subconscious mind which contains our deepest beliefs has been programmed it is these beliefs that ultimately cast the deciding vote my and so you can see now why we've been so interested and getting this subconscious mind and harmony with the word and why the Prophet puts so much weight on the subconscious actually getting fixed getting healed getting in line with the word he says when you can get the man upstairs this is the conscious mind in harmony with the subconscious mind in harmony with the word you're lining up the three and then he says whatever you say will happen because there will be nothing in your life to cast a false deciding boat there'll be nothing to overthrow the vote and so for me I got very excited when I heard this because I was like man how do we actually change this thing then and what where does it because you always want to know okay what part does God play in this what does he do for me what is he going to do what are his covenants and then what does he expect from me what does he want me to put into practice and that's where it all opened up that you become a doer of the word and not just the hearer and now what we've been doing over the series is identifying what parts of the word that you can that you should normally just practice anyway but we're just we're just shining a light on what you should normally practice so that you can go okay I'm going to put a bit of emphasis here because I can diagnose in my own life I've got a deficit in this part of my character and I've prayed and gods healed me I've been delivered maybe at the initial stages there was demon power in there you might have been possessed by a demon and it's taken over your life and you got delivered and then you over the years you got healed of it but there's still the habit and that that neural pathway that plasticity inside your mind that still does that and it's a character form sometimes and many times we don't even see it in ourselves it's actually the our wife or husband that points it out and it's the thing that probably annoys them a lot you know and and other people that you're close to they know those things too I know those things and so now by diagnosing those things you actually and you and being healed of it and died and you're diagnosing you've been healed of it and you've been delivered whatever but now it's time and you've been up for prayer baby three four five times whatever to get rid of this thing and it just keeps coming back because saying actually I want you to actually start doing putting off the old conversation I want you to start actually putting into practice my word which is the antidote remember what we spoke about the antidote antidote brother branham actually put a lot of weight on the antidote he said that at all actually but at all he says he put the word he actually applied the word anything he said it will actually change anything amen so whatever the floor is in your life the antidotes going to is an antidote for it and by acting upon that and deliberately doing that because you have dominion because this grace of God because you're not feeding the black dog anymore and and overcome by the evil and you're feeding that white dog you're strong enough to actually start making a conscious decision to do the antidote to do the right thing to start rewiring the system to start retraining the crew downstairs that subconscious mind to change your deepest beliefs because remember your soul believes the whole litical sealed if you're sealed seal it believes the soul believes there's no question never questions it but now you've got to get the subconscious to believe and what the deepest beliefs are in that subconscious will cast the deciding vote and I like it how they've word it there so right it's exactly what brother Branham seed said he's the one that gives you all the trouble yeah and actually if you if you bring it over thought together into a consolidated thought that's the only part of you that's actually stopping you from becoming a full manifested son of God and it's kind of and then when I saw that I thought well that's actually time-lock then it's time locked by the Lord's deliverance in your life it's time locked because the Lord doesn't it's not the season he's well it is the season but it's you know we're right at the end of the season but it's still this development still to heaven this furtherance in our lives you know there's an advancement to happen in our lives now that is actually if you are surrendered to God you're going to unfold according to the program according to what God has done and is doing in your life and when it when you're ready when you've got maturity to handle a bit more freedom and a bit more power and a bit more effectual faith he'll give it to you he'll Drive that enemy away you'll drive another any of my way to one day just before the rapture maybe I don't know just just one day there'll be nothing in your life nothing that will cast a false deciding vote it'll all be positive faith there'll be you whatever you say now you'll have the maturity in the character to handle that that's actually that's supreme power omnipotent that's a militant now you'll have the character to actually be completely submitted to the Lord completely you'll never do anything outside of his mind outside of his wish will outside of him it'll be completely connected your what you desire He desires what you love he loves what you hates he hates and we'll all be connected and I believe we're coming to that place you see in and the way we come to that place is by hardship trials and will the way we get trials is by doing the will of God that's all connected you know by actually putting into place surrendering your gifts to the Lord laying your life down becoming a real threat to Satan and all his help and that's when they start attacking that's when they start going in petitioning Father about how they want how they want to get you and the Lord says all right he's got enough character now do whatever you need to whatever just don't take his life and put a few boundaries on them and then he'll you know it'd be exactly - to refine you exactly and you know that would race as the battle is there is the fight and it's predestined its pre-planned it's actually pre-planned by God your whole fight your whole battle your race that you're running with patience it's been preached you know you're very patient because you want your conscious mind all I need to get this done and or there's so many things in my life that need to be delivered and you want all those things done but you see now you're going to be patient because God has got a plan and he's gonna he's got divine appointments to happen he's got some enemies to come across your path he's got things to happen things to annoy you and things to make you squirm and things to embarrass you and failures for you to make to get rid of pride and to get rid of anything that's going to hinder the work work of God in your life I'll just keep reading this that's a complex situation said dr. Lipton people have been programmed to believe that their victims and that they have no control we're programmed from the start with our mother and father's beliefs so for instance at home aren't you so thankful and these children need to be really blessed and really recognize that you're programmed by some pretty good beliefs man there's a lot of children out there and I was one of them that was not programmed by these things and so you see there's a lot of battles in my life that that like the life had to go through because of these false programs that you children and children whoever hears this you know an appearance we all must our children need to recognize how blessed they are amen in it and the Lord gives you grace and me grace to be able to convey that to them and they see that and actually on another level or god help us that they see Christ that they see that image because it's not so much yes it is what we say but it's a lot on what we do and in our body language and and in our actions and our reactions and the way we conduct ourselves and carry ourselves mine in the middle of this Babylonian mess our children are watching so we're programmed from the start with our mother and father's beliefs so for instance when we got sick we were told by our parents that we had to go to the doctor because the doctor is the authority concerning our health we all got the message throughout childhood well we're all okay so this isn't him that we we got the message throughout childhood that doctors were the authority on health and that we were victims of bodily forces beyond our ability to control that's exactly what my upbringing was exactly there was no other option it was just whatever you know it was that was it was hopeless there's a hopelessness and so you can see now anyway the joke however is that people often get better while on the way to the doctor that's when the I Nate ability for self healing kicks in another example of the placebo effect I don't know about that but anyway we're just going to teach this dealing with nervousness I'm just going to go through this is just laying a foundation for what we want to show you later brother Branham says now the first thing the lady is suffering with a tremendous nervous condition she's just on the verge of a breakdown she feels like that she's about lost her mind the reason is is because of a burden she's burdened about somebody she has a burden on her heart and a person is her husband and the man has got something like a stroke or something that's bothered him and she's pulled around with him until it's caused due to have a breakdown that's the truth is that right if it is raise your hand so R is under the discernment now this is God speaking do you believe now with all your heart there's a lot of lessons in this a lot and the way he's dealing with that and she in and he's now the question he puts there is a lot of wisdom in that do you believe with all your heart now she's actually going to think about that do I actually really believe that and she's and really in her she's going to actually master up that kind of faith and say yes I do because faith got her to this position a lot most of the time faith was what got people a prayer card you know they believed in God answered their faith and gave them a prayer card or or they got called out unto thee into the you know they were out in the congregation and brother Branham called them out by faith they touched the hem of Jesus garment so she got faith to get so far and now she's got faithful all of her heart do you really believe this with all that's within you all your heart has to be all your heart look Satan is just now you feel alright now see you feel better because as soon as you accept that it that feeling left you see it's gone now that's right see you don't feel it now do you it's gone from you if that's right raise up your hand if that weary feeling left you see because I seen it when it left see but that's just the shadow now it can't hurt you it's the devil see and he won't come to you no more if you'll believe it now you see brother branham here he said the first thing is diagnose it he exposed the devil diagnosed it she asked her do you believe with all your heart and he prayed and the demon left she was delivered of a demon a devil left - but you see now even when the devil's left there's still some things to take place it needs to be healing take place there needs to be something that's going to replace them because I seen it when it left okay now he's preaching to her and now he's telling her and he won't come to you no more now he's actually speaking vision speaking to her telling her positive things he's actually speaking a positive vision to him but she needs to believe it that's always by faith everything that you do and all that I've told you do it in faith say the things that I tell you to say say it in faith these words that you speak positive testimonies positive affirmations confessions don't just confess it on an intellectual level confess it by faith amen because you see everything you confess there's nothing that I've put in here that - for you to confess that isn't what the word says about you and if the words is that about you it is the wound that's what the word says about you it might not be a verbatim scripture but it is the it is the scripture it is the Bible that's what the Bible says about you now you can if you why that way and you want to just confess in a bottom verse feel free nothing wrong with that sometimes verses are a bit long and it's hard for you to remember but if you can memorize it praise God but I'm going to give you some things to say that that are the what the word says about you now when you confess that confess it by faith believing that there's power in that word to change your life to restructure your spirit to restructure your subconscious mind to change what you believe about yourself to retrain the crew downstairs so that that crew can steer the ship when you give it directions when you hear something you get excited up here and you're like yes I believe that but downstairs it's like no no no fear fear fear to unbelief doubt all those things because all those years you fought negatively about stuff and you keep thinking this and you thought that oh if I don't say it doesn't it's not as long as I just don't say it that you thought about it and all those thoughts for all your life of went downstairs and retrain and trained that crew to be negative so that when you get excited about some promise of God and you say yes I'm going to take that I'm going to believe that but downstairs the crews been trained so long the opposite way so there has to be a change there has to be a lifestyle change a confession change a thought change and it actually isn't an easy thing because you become so engrained in the way you think and the way you react to things that you actually got to make a conscious effort and you it's going to take prayer it take perseverance but there is a faith in you and that faith needs to confess the word and that power and that word will actually come and God's grace will change you God's grace will give you the ability to do it because he asked you to put off that old conversation to put off that old manner of life and put on Jesus Christ which has created a new creation and a new way of life a new walk all things made you Alleluia so says here and this is where it gets really good he says you believe that you're standing by Jesus Christ now which is a supernatural being here that'll keep him away from you all the days of your life hello so you see you can be delivered by a devil from it sorry delivered from a devil and then the Lord can keep that devil away from you all the days of your life and that will not exhaust the energy of God he will kick that thing away from you and it will try come back at all those things but as long as you just walk in faith and you continue and sin no more but see you can get delivered of something but if you just go back like a pig towards wallowing in the mire then you'll just get that demon has just as much legal right to come back but if you get delivered of a devil and then you sin no more as Jesus said to those many people is it I've now delivered you I've now healed you now sin no more don't go back to those things that that actually cause that devil to come into your life don't go back to it ever again because you're free now you've been given the grace and the power to change and now the word of God come forth to give you instruction and righteousness and how to conduct and how to actually apply these things so that the habits can go as well because that's really what can actually get people back is the habitual side of it as the bit that's ingrained in your thinking and ingrained in your culture and ingrained in your flesh and all your neural plasticity and in your brain and all your neural pathways and all those things that's what gets the people back after they've been delivered and healed of the scars and whatever trauma they went through the habits bring them back and then you know what comes back the demons come back the Devils come back and they start plaguing and the very emotional things that went on in subconscious come back and it all comes back and you end up seven times worse you're going but he says but now listen he says that'll keep them away from you all the days of your life you're going out here happy and rejoicing you see you're going out here happy and rejoicing you have to he's preaching a vision he's telling you now this is actually what you're going to do and ever and rejoice in the Lord because you see she was a nervous person and now she's been delivered by a demon of from a demon being delivered from that and now provisions been preached to her you're going to be under protect divine protection but now you've got to make a conscious choice to go out and be happy and rejoice now when you start doing that it's going to start changing your neuro-pathways it's going to start changing your habits it's going to start changing your subconscious it's going to start retraining the crew downstairs so that they start becoming a rejoicing person it's that rejoicing about the Lord and all of a sudden you'll start really recognizing how much you need to rejoice because you just rejoice because you're so happy that what you have you get happier and happier and more joy and more joy because you're retraining those things and so if you find that you haven't got a joy start becoming joyful start testifying that I whatever you need to testify and start speaking it out what you've actually got count your blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what God has done Amen Alleluia amen you're going his house races you're going out here happy and rejoicing and rejoice in the Lord do you believe that they'd heavenly father I lay my hands upon this little woman and I say to Satan you've lied to her and keep away from her in the name of Jesus Christ you're defeated and we are journey by the Living God to depart amen now go rejoicing lady be happy just as happy as you can be singing hymns and praising God so she's been given now a practical instruction to do the opposite of what her actual makeup was because her makeup and the way her disposition and her culture and whatever a-fixin her life and her upbringing and all that stuff had brought it to a place of nervousness and the things that she went through and the burdens that she carried and she just got overwhelmed by them all now the Prophet or God through the Prophet now telling her you need to do the opposite I'm going to give you a different way of life a different practice a practice that's going to change the way dispositioned to actually become a positive person that's happy because if you don't you'll end up down more but again and you'll start agreeing to demon power lice and then if you excite agreeing to the demon power lies you the demons will come back because you agree to them and you start welcoming them back in and you get down and morbid and depressed all those things are nervous and shaking and all those things and you actually lose your identity you start to become spiritually amnesia you forget who you are you see some when someone's really rejoicing about something really genuinely rejoicing and they recognize who they are they're like I'm so happy that I'm a Christian I'm so happy that I'm a son of God and you get so excited about the prospect of your future about what you're actually going into and like what's happening next in you you know that novelty of being a Christian and what God's got for you and what is unfolding to you you're so it's exciting it's so exciting being a Christian amen when you're connected to that identity man when you're connected to that you know it's and you rejoice about it there's all these practices that actually is so amazing it's so simple a well-trained crew is a great asset hallelujah you can imagine you know your crew is basically you know them if your crew is a real negative crew your poor conscious mind has got a very bad environment to work on it's like having a business that has a whole bunch of bad stuff and they just you know you tell them to do something and they do the opposite or they do stuff that you they do their own thing and with that business especially if it's a bigger business it will just never really go with the vision of the of the owner of the business the you know and so you see it's the same as a ship actually won't go there yet the conscious mind you see now you if the crew downstairs is all good because when you make a decision to do something because you get excited about the word and you reason it out and it's reasonable and you reason with God and you reason together he says come and let us reason together and you like yes and I agree with that it's so clear now downstairs if they're all ante and whatever has been trained so many years wrong and false you know there it becomes a bad environment because you see now that bad environment is not able to get become wholesome and and healed and well and and happy a happy spirit a happy wife keeping the house you know a happy body a happy balanced atmosphere and so that conscious mind is dealing with a whole lot of thing and it's a sandwich because your soul believes the word and there's the Holy Ghost inside your soul if you're born again got a certain thing to do and he's convicting you of this and you've putting his finger on this and your conscious mind says yes that I can't because the subconscious has got so many fears and problems and anxieties and dispersed the depressions and unable to communicate and can't can't receive love and can't give love and all those things because of all these things that's gone on all and so you your conscious mind which is the hub of your ten senses the hub of all your see taste feel smell in here and the hub of your you know your affections and reasons and conscience and all those things it's all hub than your conscience that's why it's the control tower you know it's there it's the bridge of the ship brother branham calls it that's where it all kind of takes place you know the the decisions and the direction and where we're going to go so now that poor bridge of the ship has got no air conditioning and so the atmosphere is very bad and it's got no heat up displays and so there's no vision you can't see amen it's got no stabilizing power because you can't push the button to stabilize the ship and there's no navigation because it's just getting torn about and tossed by all of the crew downstairs and they don't even run all the machines properly and so and there's no comms so all of the stuff is just going awry because really the stuff the mechanical downstairs in the body it's not playing the game it's not balanced it's not entombed it's not under submission happy it might be under submission by duress you might be ruling your spirit by malevolent rulership by legalism and that's not happy and so yes you're just performing just enough to sit in church and make everyone think you're so good but really what's going on is there's a big revolt happening downstairs it's causing trouble and causing pain and then on the other side the soul is wanting you to do ride and and your soul is saying the word of god and the word of god is so true and here's the will of God for your life and in this conscious mind is in a bad environment a very torn - minded environment but a well-trained crew is a great asset amen and all the navigation machines are all working able to be led by the Spirit amen connected to heaven hallelujah can in every situation a balanced reaction hallelujah you know through a stabilization brother Brennan said the stabilizers have been put on the ships you know the the great waves are roaring in this day but the stabilizers have been placed hallelujah the ships now going to crest every wave amen hallelujah see now that crew that's in tune that crew that's been trained well retrained because now you know you've been given the wisdom you've been given the knowledge you won't perish you're not going to perish by coming under an emotional storm of this Babylonian age you're able to create an atmosphere its air-conditioning in the bridge and the communication because your circles you see up here you can reason it out in your soul yes in the subconscious yes that actually is being healed that can receive love you need to really make the conscious environment to bring a real clear navigation a stabilization and air conditioning a comms in an HUD so that the ship can actually be stared right so that the ship can actually go in the direction of the Holy Ghost so that the ship can move with the pillar of fire and what the Lord's doing and the ship can actually Crist and brother Bram said very soon the Lord we will we're going to we're going to we're going to whatever you call it we're going to disembark upon the new world amen we're going to we're going to we're going to reach the shores hallelujah and we're going to go and have a winning supper amen hallelujah there's shippers on it's just about to it's just about to I don't even know what the word is Beach that's a dock amen sorry I don't have very good - it's a whale we got a dock Amen Alleluia but you see you've got to have a good navigation you've got to be supported by the crew hallelujah got to get all of those three in alignment amen we're about running out of time here and I want to get to the point here so here we've got now I ask these questions what are you speaking in where are you heating a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but a perverseness Theron is a bridge and the spirit remember the in the same book of Proverbs this is he there has no control over his own spirit is like a city broken down without walls so the spirit is he is the soul and the spirit is what you need to get control over by a true benevolent leadership by a loving leadership in your own life because you see the Lord holds you accountable on how you lead and he's going to teach you to lead in your own life by your own spirit teach you to lead your spirit right not under duress or you better behave or no actually coming drawing on the eternal resource of God he's given you to change these things and to act in a certain way to be a certain way by faith to see a real change a lasting change a lifestyle change stop confessing negatively stop speaking negatively stop thinking negatively very much so amen a wholesome tongue is a tree of life man butter / versus the breach in the spirit you see now we go into healing by spiritual medicine brother Branham says in order to stay with God stay gentle God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love God is love they make not Nevers be self-sufficient don't think of yourself as this big sufficient thing and able to do all these things always rely on God always conduct yourself with meekness and lowliness as low and as making it humble in this kind as you can be because you are human and there are still fleshly things that are going to annoy other people and so if you should become this dominant it's going to start annoying people you caused wrong atmosphere that's why yes God wants us to develop into who we are and all of that but you see even if you're so you're gifted and whatever always carry those gifts and humility always be meek it always you know be think about us you know and think about others before yourself and those things in the reason he sees that is because he he wants an atmosphere he wants the church he wants the local body to be in an atmosphere and when everyone's meek and kind to each other in that atmosphere the devil can't use their floors to annoy each other and start causing pains and problems and troubles and fighting amen always rely on him never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts and take them into your carnal mind and repeat them over Amen Alleluia and that's going to be a theme for so the plan of attack and I'm just going to we will not preach now he's going to teach purely because I don't have time to preach here diagnose uncover what God is dealing with now don't get overwhelmed by the whole battle like I said before you can you'll probably pick a few things in your own life that you know is the trouble don't try and have God deal with all of them all at once God doesn't work like that well maybe he does sometimes this is but generally and what we've seen in the types is that God deals with one thing at a time he'll deal with one enemy at a time he will do one thing at a time for you right in your own life so don't get overwhelmed with the whole thing with all your faults and all your problems because people do that and then they think they're useless and they're down and they can't ever get anywhere in life they're never going to amount to anything and they've been told that all their life maybe don't get overwhelmed by the whole thing by all your problems and all your fault but find out what God is dealing with right now find out that fault that character defect or that complex or debt that scar or that whatever it may be it's severe or as Unser veer significant or insignificant as it may be whatever God's dealing with what have you failed it lately what have you been going through lady what are your trials themes been lately find out what that is because you see God wants to deal with it he's dealing with it don't go down that mountain another time yeah let it be dealt with there you might need deliverance and healing you might need counseling it depends on what it is it might just be a little insignificant thing but you see God wants to deal with it amen he wants to in those little things you might think of small but it could cause a major thing later on or it could be the the little link between major things in your life and he wants to deal with that first and then he'll deal with the major thing so you don't know we've just got to hold his hand they kept another host he's going to take us through the land so you might need deliverance healing because you see a demon might be in your life and I'm not saying you this is just hypothetical now that can be delivered but there could be scar there could be a real hurt that's happened a trauma because you know a way a devil can get into someone's life is through a traumatic experience a real traumatizing experience and they lose their mental faculty that go insane for a short period of time or whatever their walls break down and the demon comes in and but the thing is at that traumatic time a great breach or a great rupture can happen in the emotional realm and actually cause deep damage that needs to be healed and so yes deliverance needs to happen but then healing also needs to happen the person needs to actually relive the thing and talk about it and actually go through it with somebody and pray and actually get real supernatural healing from the issue from whatever it is that's that's why it's so important to diagnose and a lot of the stuff you know you need to do if the pastor especially if it's something that's quite serious you need to go through it with somebody because it actually can you don't just want to mess around and play Church with that sort of stuff that's quite serious but it you see those are the things can actually hold you back from receiving more of God as things in your life so that's why it but it's so good that you can actually find out what what God wants to deal with by the trials you're going through what has fingers on and what you're convicted about and what you're failing it deal with that now go into the battle prepare to finish stay with it don't just give up and think oh it's just not going to happen it will happen some things just take time and you really need to stick with it you never go into a battle unless you're prepared to win the battle amen you're mentally prepared now because all these things that we're going through here I'm not that these aren't overnight fixes these aren't even weekly fixes these are life style changes that can take months and months of going through and in on the other hand the supernatural God if you can put his finger or something and you can be healed instantly of it there is different ways that God can heal so don't ever rule anything out always just what with God and know what God is going to do and when you walk close with them you'll know apply the medicine is directed by the doctor amen amen and there's a certain way we're going to apply this there's a certain type of medicine that I'm talking about here and we'll show you what I'm talking about always rely on the power contained in the word you are speaking by faith not just by intellect yes put brother Browne and said take their thoughts and put them in your carnal mind your intellect because we want to put that intellect into its place don't we we don't want their intellect being a wild child that's unbalanced we want their intellect to actually be a happy intellect that's balanced and is actually happily dormant that's fresh so we can just take that you know a happily dormant because in Romans 6 it says here that is knowing this that your old man is crucified with Christ and just old man is destroyed that we're destroyed is not annihilated yet it's just dormant so their old nature by the grace of God by the power of God by the revelation of God actually gives you dominion to Rickon that old nature dormant so that it's dead is destroyed but it's actually not annihilated yet it's still there until you put off this old tabernacle but you can actually end but it can it can be happily balanced ly dormant amen so that the chemicals in your body come under the influence of God's thoughts that you've decided to think that you've chosen to think and the actions that you've chosen to do and the antidotes that you've chosen based on your faults so whatever faults that you diagnose in your life the issues you know find the antidote talk to a minister talk to a pastor about the antidote go through it together that's what it says confess your faults one to another because you need someone much actually why don't you do this let's pray and do that and this is the opposite stand they might have a testimony actually I did this and it worked it's what's so important now we're in an environment where we can this is not a place of where we're competing against each other we can confess our faults whatever no one's going to judge you they love you we all love each other it's so good amen always so remember they don't take it just it's always rice it always rely on the power contained in the word you are speaking by faith not just by intellect so one of them and now there's so many one of the issues that you might face and now this is all hypothetical so don't but if something does come up it might just bring to my memory something that you've gone through so some people have a difficulty believing every word and these are some of the things that can actually cause that lie to by parents always endured unfulfilled promises by parents or loved ones leaders churches these things mentally soil by Western education curriculum of unbelief and that's my that was me you just get taught stuff that's completely the opposite of the Bible but also I don't think I was lied to by parents really they didn't really need to lie to me because they just openly did everything they wanted to do always enjoyed unfulfilled promises my parents people this can actually cause people trouble now not everyone is built in the way with this you know some people everything that ever happened negative has been a big problem in their life and they've just never overcome it and they always remember they always speak about it and it's just and then there's some people that don't even remember it but yet it doesn't matter who you are there are some things that have affected you some things head now I'm glad you're sitting down so you don't fall off your seat because it's not too far but this is so simple the resolution for this I believe the Word of God with all my heart that's all you need to say that's all you need to confess I believe the Word of God with all my heart that's not some big fancy thing it's the most simple thing and this is how it's so exciting all the stuff you know maybe you have trouble when some people have trouble leaving the Word of God and a lot of our subconscious is already doubting you know because of all the false thoughts that have gone through 3550 16 whatever years of our life we've been negatively thinking all these things but now it's time to start changing it now it's time to start thinking actually I believe the Word of God with all my heart let that thought stay in your mind let that thought come out of your mouth when a doubt comes no I believe the Word of God with all my heart brother Branham asked that lady did you believe it with all your heart yeah that encapsulates the whole thing I believe the Word of God with all my heart amen say it just keep saying it you can say it now when vain repetition I looked at the supper because I didn't want to get start teaching vain repetitions a vain repetition is actually a repetition that has no value but there is actually a valuable repetition Jesus actually said you know you go to the you go to the unjust judge and you just keep going and you keep praying you be perseverant amen now and that was actually now he's talking when he talked about payment petitions he was talking about praying now this is not even praying this is actually a testimony your testimony is I believe the Word of God with all my heart and you can say that over and over if you like actually this brother Brennan said repeat them over because these people that have gone through these traumatic experiences that have been nervous and they've gone to their prayer line and they need to do that because they're getting hounded by that devil believe you me see that devil might not be able to harm them but he'll still try and he would have been that lady would have been bettered and that's what brother pam said just go rejoicing singing her giving her instruction no matter all the stuff and the fiery darts that gets fired at you for the next 10 five months or years whatever that people try to get you back you just sing instead you start testifying a word instead and he said it you know get them into your carnal mind and repeat them over and over and so you know for me I before I go to sleep and I've got my little I know I've diagnosed my life and I know my things that are that are that in my troubles and so I've prescribed myself some medicine these are exact opposite of the things that I have in my life that are troublesome that I know there's probably many that I don't know but if you care to tell me please I'm all is so before I go to sleep and I pray and I meditate on the word I meditate on these things too and I think to myself and I say it I believe the Word of God with all my heart because you see my subconscious was programmed by the soiled by Western education and my parents were soiled by the same education so they taught that to me as a child so my upbringing in school everything was all unbelief and so I need this because yes I believe the Word of God with all my heart and I believe it I really do and I've seen it you cannot not believe it but that doesn't mean that downstairs that Cruz still needs to be retrained it still needs to be retrained and I but the good thing is that I'm at a point now and I've been doing this for quite a long time I can see the results and so if you are struggling not all of us struggle with this not all of us do some of us have been raised in faith raised by parents that taught faith some cultures like African cultures in that that they don't have unbelief like that Western culture does because everything spiritual and their supernatural going on in all religions and it's just open they don't have any trouble believing for miracles and believing for did being raised that all that sort of stuff because it's just normal that's actually just normal there there's no other way that's it you need to get healed you go to God or you go to the witch doctor whatever religion you go do and they go and get healed things actually happen there's not so they're raised like then they have been for hundreds of generations but over here there's a bit different you know and so for me I need to do that and I've actually seen it work and I've seen things happen in my life where now I pray and you know there's the more of an affinity going on between my conscious and subconscious now that doesn't mean to say that God can't change you supernaturally instantly and get your subcultures cleaned out he can if he decides to do it that way for you hallelujah and that does and with and if you find that your now I'm not dealing with the soul here because my soul believes the Word of God it does it is the Word of God you know you cannot not believe what you are because that's what you are amen so I am i clear do you understand you follow good I just want to make that real clear because I don't want anything y'all know Andy is now teaching about not believing the word anymore I believe the word and I believe it really strongly you know and I see it happening hallelujah but the subconscious now is actually starting to actually believe that and actually coming on board and what brother brems said the three are coming into alignment because I'm applying the doctors medicine spiritual medicine which is actually taking the thoughts of God into your carnal mind and repeating them over as the Prophet said and now I just put there I believe the message with all my heart which is the Bible anyway but I believe the message with all my heart amen some people fail to really connect with church family and maybe perhaps they're suffered rejection at school and have got all sorts of drawn up resent our reserve Minh cebause letting go of their affections towards people outside of their immediate family and some people even in extreme cases can't even connect with their immediate family and so it depends on how severe you've been in through a trauma in your life just to make you emotionally detached and and restricted from actually loving somebody because you're scared that you're going to be rejected maybe they've been ostracized from peer groups experience rejection when you opened up to people you know when you get to know someone a bit more and then all the sudden you feel a bit freer and you say something real stupid or you do something you like you just express yourself and they're like what an out of it go and then they they don't call you anymore you don't get the phone call to go hang out the next day here but weird ha I have an experience there by the way I have been through a lot of this those trust me yeah I have been through these things now but I I now parents always warned about trusting people outside the blood family you know sow seeds of fear into the children but the solution my church family loves and cares for me and I for them it's all you know I'm not saying you have to say this verbatim but if you find you're struggling with connecting with your church family there is medicine there is something that you can confess and you can say it you can believe it and say it by faith my church family loves and cares for me and I for them I am safe to trust and love my church family you can just say that and if you're struggling with that here you go say those things just say them believe them don't just say them in your intellect actually take them and believe them by faith they are these are actually these are God's thoughts there in the Bible there's a unity that he brings there's a love amongst rhythm that he brings so now I'm paraphrasing a theme in the Bible I'm encapsulating a biblical theme of love and unity and trust and being able to confess your faults one to another my church family loves and cares for me and I for them I am safe to love and trust my church family I am safe to open up my heart to my church family safe Alleluia my church family will not laugh at me when I start confessing my fault so amen they will not judge me Amen Alleluia now when you do these things and if you want to you want something you want to say something that's opposite or whatever never put it into the future of the past it is the present it has to be I am this or verse is this not this will be or I hope no it's not faith faith Caesar is a man that's what I'm talking about here these are statements of faith these are positive thoughts of then catch you later blue cool truth about you and then truth is not something out of you it's in you already Alleluia let's move fast because it's late struggling with the last thing after the opposite gender this is a big one this is a big one long association with this is some of the reasons why long association with ungodly lascivious people was not connected to parents emotionally or found connection elsewhere exposure to explicit material as a youth to soil their thinking and make them lust now there's a big subject on that whole thing that we know but this we're not going to go into it but the solution i have no pleasure nor comfort and lusting after woman so what you need to say now it might not happen overnight if you're mentally engrained in a certain way and you're thinking a certain way and you've allowed yourself to go and lust after woman for so many years or woman to lust after men and it's just become an ingrained part of your habit and your your way of life and you struggle with it you actually really are going to take time and you've got to discern and talk to the pastor to know whether it's a spirit because if it's a spirit that spirit needs to go first and then if there is things that's happened in your life that's you know and there might have been you know you weren't connected and you connected to something you've got to find out what that connection was and where it happened and where you went off and actually go through it with somebody and posture and pray about it and get healing from there and ask the Lord to take take that out of you and change those habits and go through it specifically and say I said I wasn't going to go into it but there is a way through these things now if it's just the habitual thing that you're struggling with and you've been dealt with and you've been prayed for and all those things and you know that you've been delivered if there ever was a spirit there then you there is a way out and that is actually changing what your subconscious has been programmed so long doing and that way is by taking that thought into your carnal mind and actually changing it and doing the opposite so here you're saying the opposite you're actually telling yourself now because what you tell yourself and the thoughts that you put down into your subconscious that faithfully believes everything you say and whether it's positive or negative whether it's a lie or the truth it's believing what you tell it so if you tell it I have no pleasure nor comfort and lusting after women or men if you're a woman it will believe that now I won't believe it straight away but it might take a long time it might take they actually did Studies on this stuff on what the on this because this is actually also in the medical field on how to overcome all sorts of things and they say it takes about three months I'm actually doing this everyday and everynight of actually saying these things and testifying them and declaring them it actually takes a long time for their subconscious to go click because the subconscious is designed so that it takes a bit of time for things to click otherwise everything will click and you just become swayed around by everything but it actually takes a bit of time is like it's a protection for you but also that protection works in a disfavor if you have negatively enforced thoughts on your subconscious for so long because it takes habits and you've got to form habits new habits and now you're telling yourself your subconscious here a truth that's based on a righteous life now brother Branham actually said in this subject he said that if you you need to run your life through a thinking man's filter now if you if you run your life through a worldly man's filter you will develop a worldly man's taste if you start and end therefore and if I bring it into this subject if you're walking through the city and every undressed female that walks around you you cannot stop looking and you keep looking and you turn around and then you look back again you're developing the world immense taste you're starting to develop habits that are going to lead you into a place which makes it very difficult for you to get out of it becomes very hard very very hard because you because it's enticing and these spirits attached to those people that wear those clothes and those spirits start to come on you and they start to affect you and they start to affect your emotions and they affect your whole life but on the opposite and this is so freedom free and you can make a conscious choice now it takes a bit of strength and a grace of God for you to make a conscious choice to do the opposite and actually say no I'm not going to look and even though your flesh is saying look look look look will you say no I'm going to look away and it's at first and maybe for the first month that's going to be a bit difficult but then after that brother Branham says that if you run your life through a holy men's taste you'll do a holy man filter you develop a holy man's taste and your spirit will start to desire to look away and you'll start to form new tracks in your mind and you're thinking that actually enjoy looking away and enjoy doing what is right and you start remembering the fellowship and it goes through your imagination your conscience your affection your reasoning and all your everything it goes through the whole lot and it starts retraining in all your thinking and everything all of a sudden that you're out of it you've developed a will a holy man's taste now on the other side of their action because that's doing it that's actually doing the antidote acting upon it you've you can also start telling yourself I actually don't like this because really you don't your soul hates it your soul hates unrighteousness your soul hates that your your conscious mind hated and it gets into a mess of turmoil if you're involved in this and I know firsthand because I've been and down this road very bad I wasn't the past that I had was very bad and so coming into Christianity it took a long time for me to get through all these things so I can preach this from a very strong experience and I know that these things here work I know that it works and not all of us struggle with us not all of us have this issue but many do any red-blooded male can fall into this trap I have no pleasure nor comfort and lusting after woman if you're married I am completely satisfied with my wife it's two-pronged approach actually there's a three pronged approach because either status Jesus is the source of my comfort these are things that you can to clear amen these are things that you can if you are in the middle of a storm then you'll stuff up with this and and the devil's trying to get you done down this track you could just stop and say no I'm looking away and I have no pleasure or comfort and lusting after women I hate unrighteousness I hate lasciviousness as David said I hate the work of them that turn aside so you can imagine you can see and and that's just some I'll just read out a few things here to you just so you get a more of a an idea and believe me is about is thousands of them that I've gone through but for now and for the purposes of being 930 we're not going to we're not going to go through it but you can declare these are some of the things you can declare I believe the Word of God with all my heart covetousness is unrighteousness my identity is in the Holy Ghost I believe what the Word says about me I'm an eagle and overcomer the bride I'm blessed beloved perfect precious treasure unique faithful joyous queen elect beautiful spotless sinless righteous selfless stalwart rugged merciful gracious living epistle friend eternal you can declare these things about yourself because that is who you are amen amen and then I'll just go down to here these are some of the things you can say I love Jesus Christ with all my heart I can express my love and word indeed I am greatly loved by my family I am greatly loved by God I have a powerful and supernatural prayer life I am the bride of Jesus Christ I am completely content with God's provision Jesus loves spending time with me all my family are coming in the rapture I am happy and willing to surrender everything to Jesus you know some people find that very hard I have a cup I have no comfort in unrighteousness healing is part of my inheritance Jesus Christ is the source of all my comfort I have perfect faith and perfect peace I respect godly correction regardless of where it comes from I am on speaking terms with God my eyes are on the Lord Jesus regardless he enjoys me he enjoys the works of my hands which praise Him God smiles when I smile Jesus wants to heal me he's happy when I'm happy he enjoys spending time with me I am growing in God's grace the spoken word is already within my mouth I have the blessing of Abraham in my life God speaks to me and I can hear him I am resting in the promises of God I have everything I need in Jesus Christ whatever I touch is blessed you start saying some of these things about yourself and eventually you'll really start believing them and when you really start all three you're lined up to believe those things your identity is very secure and you're going to recognize who you are and you're gonna leave hallelujah amen when the bride recognizes who she is she's going to leave this place hallelujah amen she's gonna take a walk one day and she's gonna walk right up to him amen when she recognizes who she is and now what is it that's stopping you recognizing here as your subconscious amen and that's exactly what it is that's the dimension in your life that's holding you back that's your your enemy as brother branham sinners we're all your trouble comes from is that subconscious amen now but that thing is going to be changed and God's given us many tools how to change it now you can confess those things and confess them until you believe them hallelujah amen that the communication of your faith may become effectual the power start coming out of your life the virtue of add to your faith virtue by acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus that's what we've just done Saints and sorry I had to rush through the the core of the sermon because of the start but I think it was ordered of the Lord that way acknowledge every good thing that's within you fail not to do it don't don't give up acknowledge what's good within you remember what's good within you repeat what's good within you musicians please God give you energy and strength for enduring so long on a weeknight and I do thank you so much and I think the Lord you know is just dealing with some stuff hallelujah these may be very earthly practical things amen but they'll bring very good heavenly things to you amen let's just play um that heart song again that one that we sung I bill my heaven maker let's play that you see your boat the Word of God when Noah created the boat by the Word of God that boat took Noah above the judgments of the world and took Noah above those judgments and that boat was stabilized because it was done according to the Word of God the Word of God was building that boat next ship and that ship was on a destined route one day that ship was going to anchor upon the unseen mountain you see there was a new earth that was coming on the horizon and Noah was in fellowship with a dove amen and now your ship heads by the message of the hour a prophet of this age the Word of God has taken you above the judgments of this earth rose darkness on the people but light on you a risin shine the light has come thy boat has become buoyant by boat by shippers ion is floating above the judgments of this earth now you're in connection with the Dove and that dove is going in and out and is telling you and is giving you and revealing to you about the world to come amen that dove is sending messages and bringing messages back from that new earth from that place hallelujah now your ship will be steered by the help what you speak what you confess what you think and what you say [Music] so whatever problems in your life whatever struggles do the opposite diagnose it confess the opposite take that word until your carnal mind and repeat it over until you know who you are until you recognize in every realm of your life who you are and when it happens when you really recognize who you are and the fullness you're going to leave you're going to live sakes there's a rapture waiting for you hallelujah and God's giving you some practical tips now practical easy but long it's a long game it's not a short game amen there are short games and listen you know with the supernatural and God the gospel of fire can help you and do its spontaneous miracles in your life never negate that fact sometimes we need that we all want that there are a generation that wants things done now we want an instant but not everything comes instead some things are going to come with a fight some things are going to come with a fire something they're going to come through floods some things are going to come by the blood and all through the blood story now let's enter these battles to not give up its fight the good fight of faith together amen and we'll just praise the Lord let's just pray Lord Jesus I pray you bless the word to our hearts I commit through the readings and and what we've spoken about to you Lord and I pray you'd help us to put it into action in the name of Jesus Christ I commit these services to you the series to you and I pray it would be a real blessing to your bride that we would really benefit from it Lord and you would help us father to really love that you would give us the diagnosis of our lives so that we can rise above all of the works of Satan all of his lies and darkness and Jesus Christ name Amen Alleluia it's just stand and sing the song shall we ah I am me if all my and before even time [Music] my life was in his head he knows my hand I know and reform he sees each day the Falls and here's me [Music] Oh [Music] and he'll no matter where [Music] he knows my name he knows my every move he sees each team oh and here's a [Music] just remember Saints don't just hide these things down and leave them bottled up in your life go see the pastor talk to your peers it's up to each other about these things this is you know share your faults one with another pray for each other you see we're in it together we're moving together and these things in each one of our lives and God's dealing with let's deal with the place let's go through these things with the Lord and with each other and and and see real healing take place and see these things disappear being given the tool we've been given the grace to actually overcome to actually come to recognize who we are and they're so simple these talk but you know sometimes we just need to talk to each other you see though the Lord knows all about us and knows all these things it's just trusted amen and see real change and go into this battle prepare to finish amen and look unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith amen he will empower you to go through it all he will give us the grace amen I mean I had significant or significant it may be in your life whatever he's put his finger on
