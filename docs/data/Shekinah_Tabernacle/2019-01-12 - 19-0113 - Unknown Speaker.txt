amen in Wellington and to also for me of become a brother a poor wife in the family in the mist and I want to thank but been for this confidence to stand before you and I pray goes to a thorough disappoint that confidence praise the Lord and the go will give us a portion today praise the Lord so I know that song not prepare me as a young man the Lord called me my early 20s and I asked God what did he get my body my soul my spirit to serve you because when I read the prophets message well got to the profit age of 17 don't defy several women smoking or alcohol when you grow up I will use you now it was not meant for the profit only amen we all temples of God so if God as us has mercifully revealed it to you I don't care whether you are 7 year old or 10 years old or 62 years which I put up in features to come right you see crichton Lord Lord prepare me let me get my temple if I clap I want the clap of Jesus amen if I'm actually working I want to work for Jesus amen I want I want I want they don't spoken anointing to speak for yourself because we are billboards for God you believe that all right so the prayer right now sure what was it was he what the prophets oh I forgot the the new face okay thank you so um so this morning I got the you know the family altar and they just God just spoke to me and I feel like I can share this force I'm sure you did read it as well but just - yeah thank you okay so so if we are going to serve the Lord it is now not tomorrow and to give the best we can while we can and when I read this - by my side could share with the church this morning so but I'm speaking so I appreciate all the singings the so we come together for this thank you for this single hour hike on the bless I had to come and you know look and you know hear the sons of God bless you for that yes Oprah said and now I come home just for a little rest I lost 20 pounds in this last meeting and by the measure and brother Dodd was up a while ago and said Robin I noticed that you do you put your whole heart into it and I said that's the only way you can do a right kind of a job for the Lord is to put everything you've got right into the forefront for Christ all your strength all your soul or your heart or your mind everything that you got when you are doing anything do it right or don't do it at all so it would be a Christian it was a Christian for the Lord or go to the world but for me I remember one way when we when I was in high have a very tough a single prefect he said we always say when you addresses the student it's either you do it or you do it right so it's either make Chris up or I'm a Christian so that's no place for the devil there's a lot so when you do anything do it right just or don't we see just leave it alone if you are going to be a Christian put everything you've got to Christ that's your time that's your talent your everything so if God give you time to think you think you put time to do it why you're not singing it entertaining anybody you are singing to defy the body praise the Lord I never know what that song we do to somebody there's a lot so I just not seen this young fella vibrato in squad that's your wife brother bones isn't it playing and singing they're that young couple and is it isn't a piano you know is it an organ was something kind of instrument this straw me time pick it and do something for the Lord if you could do that and sing and win souls do something no matter if you whistle can you imagine just me whistle why we're so just do something just to testify or to do something for the kingdom of God whatever you got put it to put it to use in God's service we appreciate that okay so um let us stand up it and turn to the scriptures okay so my the title of my hesitation this book this morning is here how we do continue city and now just really warned that I preached this message in upland and I thought to share with us after bow Isaac's message or Isaac yeah about the state of the of the world the economy and and it looks like where are we and it says something we have no place here I see a memorizing I have no place here but I have a kingdom have no producer here well praise the Lord okay so um I have four scriptures today this morning so Hebrews 13 12 to 14 and as problem we say if you gotta say Amen okay so I take it you got it okay so we're for Jesus also like him identify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here how bring a continued City but we seek one to come so second Corinthians chapter five just one verse for we know that if our earthly house or Vista markowitz dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in heavens join to the 14 Oh verse 1 let your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me Christ said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again for sure and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and finally scripture Luke 17 likewise also as its what ideals of lot they did eat to drunk these BOTS the sold the planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thought that it'd be shall it be in the day when it's enough - revealed there's a lot may go up blessing to read Novus where in Jesus Christ's name may be seated us relax the Lord is here to give you your portion and I'm also looking for him to give my portion to praise the Lord okay so as a question is the world in southern condition today and the other question I didn't put easier easier is yet a way of escape there's a lot we just read in the scriptures all right so so when you see tsardom when you see sudden being replay today then you know that God's judgment upon the world is imminent and for the bride is home doing time glory to God and that's why the professor said in third Exodus and the most terrible condition that Christianity has ever lived in yesterday we write on the brain of or the brink of a great terrific judgment laying for the church and before this judgement can happen God is calling it's unethical going home time just like he did the ammo rising was was heaped up and so he's calling spiritual ethics now the promise said in a Semin when your eyes are open and I quote he says when all heaven is don't loose or hell based on loose so no wonder no wonder people walk around in rags and say it's fashion do you see them on the street when you go to the malls I when we a smile so think that's it Mad Men going racks right but today is fashion we put two going in torn clothes and in his fashion right today somebody say oh now um well I'm not sure what I'm a boy or girl right and don't you don't you don't even you dare to question or criticize them on the street you become what so now the right has become rock has become right um people are trying to normalize the abnormal would work know is that this little little reason why they are running mad and crazy yeah there's a lot so when the world is sad to work with a head down and see that is the fashion of the day I will refuse and I will come back two feet last Sunday Barbara been talking about oddball Obama said it clearly that we all Autobots one another present lot so I'm not ashamed to be oddball for Jesus amen so when you and your school when you are the job you can't get your own ball then take your stand okay so they were talking about ready just feeders go where I was working before as we're talking about hooha they went to this party that drunken and he came to my turn I said well I don't drink I'm Tito Tito since it's in the Lord yes so you have to know where I'm standing yeah hit me or love me I don't care you know what I mean by that you know I don't bother what you're feeling because what my stand for the Lord that's how I supposed to be there's a lot so let people know where you are standing black cod though I don't love you for it or hated for it but who cares as long as my lord lost me as long as I laid down and woke up in the morning my hardest not afraid when I'm going to be on the rapture oh praise the Lord so now let us turn to Roma I want 21:21 because I just feel idling this down because he suspends were very particular correct please don't talk about it and you know we have to you know okay let's 21 okay so because that when everybody got it yes when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we have found four but because but became vain in their imaginations look at it and we have foolish sorry and their foolish heart was darkened because what mom said a fool has said there's no God right so when it took God out of the equation their lives and the activities they become foolish they become they become mental and think old I say that's more than that's the order of the day don't even dare to come against it okay let's follow the Scriptures verse twenty-two professing themselves to be wise okay yeah go to be wise they became fools and changed glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruption corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God was God also gave them up to uncleanness to the loss of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God get them up into vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature lesbianism right and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of women moon and old Indian laws won't was another men with men working that which is unseemly homosexual ISM right through the Lord and receive it look at in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet and even as it did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave up over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not confident and I looked up the word people bit bad weekend shameless immoral corrupt hardened and all regenerate praise the Lord that's the world living here and this is the norm of the day praise the Lord all the nations visit is it lesbian gay bisexual transgender and Q and I you know what K being squid so those who are not sure where that men a woman that he's so crazy it's not crazy tango for Malachi for hallelujah thank God for Christ himself hallelujah he came down himself no I don't feel sorry for those who questioned the minister brahbrah are will Abraha how could a man make this up no matter how you are so you have ability to make up things and the see people cannot raise the Lord so this was february 28 1964 where correct yeah c3 yes thank you that God already prophesied gave this to the prophet and prophesied that is several angels and when it happened in that vision he thought his life was over because they're gonna be a change the turning point in the ministry to bring the world that was ripped to prepare you and I and now what is Christ so that's what we are going beyond goes and the Prophet so what the purpose said we're going beyond the sign to the voice of the sign but the voice will now take us to our destination ma so if I come in from agony we are working and you two samples Wellington yeah so as a sign if I stop there no good well I had to for this sign to my destination and that is how why we we have to us individuals take this message personally it is not enough to come to church on Sunday and hear problems preach a wonderful message and and that's it and probably on the Wednesday or not and they come back on Sunday no is a daily effect hmmm I'm approbation about worship in so it's not just singing and praising is the daily life you worship when you lead to some your friend your family members what do you say to the person how you react how it what their lives is what should be worshipped and pleasing him so we are we we are not profit here so we fill so what what bit a difference is how quick we can make things right ma how big we can repent and not be too quick to point fingers because when you are pointing this and responding to be towards it so we can say something got our knees and say Lord I bring my brother on the altar with me but the blood for me is for him me is for her bring my wife I've been my children and when you're doing that there's still room for bitterness because you cannot be in God's presence and be bitter present Lord so I've always said in the ocean of time so just to see to hear what was said about this day so many years ago is that the passion was to be a sign of the end and today the portion is in the homosexual is on the increase that even 40% of our national government is possessed with profession that's newspaper that's right and said again in modern events mclubbe a prophesy and so remember just said as it was the days of Sodom on Sodom socially BR the coming of the Son of Man so everybody agree about the the world is in some condition yeah and they say it keeps you keep putting the profit so I picked up Los Angeles a paper not long ago and said I think Hamas is on the increase of 20 or 30% in Los Angeles each year a cuisine that much always horrible government and everywhere everything just becoming Privett that's right the whole thing the whole system the church and everything else is provided what is it a day just a day just like that look at perversion whom Allah pick up in a pepper pepper last look this is this is how many years ago almost 50s from the years ago right so how about today so just to show you where we are it's only time to relax I'm Stan Stan fluff flat-footed say Tata be on our toes and say Lord let this word reveled me let me be the Word made flesh bring me to my place my promise for these days our adoption looking for body change looking for the rapture amen so it's going to be a deliberate conscious work with the Lord and it double so smart how does not say that the sons of the king of the world are wiser the sounds of the kingdom why in the sense that you know this is all that will make it to glory I don't even give time for it so there were given the social media instant facebook to instagram and first I got to tweet that on Twitter too and you spend all your time and add any feel empty and there's no no desire for the Lord here's the Lord so that's the devil's trap trick but God is here today and then his prince is here what is't said I'm not about I'm just speaking his words we are two or three are gathered together in your name I am de indias mace okay and I'll answer your question when God took the Prophet did the angel go with him did it take the into the way as well no so he's here fixing things getting you and I ready to make it to blow the lamb hallelujah so so I don't care when all hell is on earth yes and all happening soon on Eid as well hell is putting this way you and I and heaven is pulling this way as a question who will win who will know that's not ever answered me I said heaven is on earth hell is on earth without their things and hell is pulling so you just imagine it does what you call the rope they talk top of war yes so heaven is pulling this way hell is pulling this way and ask a question who will win thank you it's called hundred percent okay so now still I read this one okay it yeah so just continue sober Barham balsam a living with with another living in hotel rooms promotion that natural course of of lobbying provided because human has belittle themselves and become so common it's profitable another man pervaded minds women living with women man living with man just what God said was in place as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of son of man so I just want to read a quote from as the ego status is net there's a lot if you if you feel sleepy you can just stand up yes I'm just going to be a godly Smith so but make sure you don't you don't lose that I am so glad that we have a Heavenly Father whose will who will if we permit him put us in a place where the helm of the Devils cannot bother us and where the lair whiskey and nightclubs cannot touch us far beyond the polluted streams of the this world and his fantasies if we permit him and is here this morning hallelujah praise the Lord now he said and we look at the great evil such plague click play goes today who I'm just reading a quote so I'm not addressing anybody particular part that the mother I go speak to eaglets I mean and we look at great evils that plague to us today we can see that just over yonder horizont advancing the great oncoming judgments to this country in this world for book and not let us get by with sin he will not be a righteous God if if he let us live the way we live and get by within he will make us pay for our sins and as I've said before I say again even writers God of heaven let's get let us get by with our sin he will have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and a projected aim for destroying them for we are just as bad member Ramos speaking to the church a drug okay now anyone who has a spirit of living God in his heart surely will feel the hot blast of the uncommon judgment that's hope that's about to hit the world in your spirit you can descend and know that something's about to happen the whole world is quivering hands and I chose the little nation the big nations from the hands of comments come it's an ungodly evil weathermen lays the power to turn this world into ashes in one minute orders keeping them from doing this is the mercy and no sudden of God that's at all you because the Holy Ghost is in you so as long that the world is here when they let's who that letter will let us when you go to rapture they come back here you see then you see terrible things who are not you because we go over there there's a lot okay right so let's keep reading the Lord is coming soon and the Word of God is fulfill itself with such rapidity that only listen only the true born again so you can't go past this because maybe children are born in families the message should Wendy train grew up and you grow up from your childhood here and about Bihar by the Bible but that does not mean you're born again God God doesn't have grandchildren so you have children so you need an experience so that's why I ought to be desperate but remember it's not matter of oh no no no no go has already given to you the holy God before the war began you're a gene of of God and it says it's my for us we're to give it a Kindle my mom said go also give us the Holy Ghost whatever can decide what you've got to decide you've got to be desperate for it amen and so that's how you can put your head up wait wait when I go to whenever you are no jobs and don't don't say oh maybe when I'm 20 years old a message no I told I feel like I bleed missile yes yesterday so what that means that I'm still Lord I'm so of you every day I need your strength I need your grace I need that I need they will feel the Holy Ghost because I said that they done denims of this church is refilling so so it says so you got you gotta become one to work with God say Lord you know having been in Detroit maybe I play music as well or singing but lord I just want that experience I'm gonna give it to you it says the Lord is coming soon and the Word of God is written in self with such rapidity that only the true born-again spirit filled and spirit lead Christians can keep odd and above board in this hour - I read it again I read again the Lord is coming soon and only the word and the Word of God is fulfill yourself with such rapidity that already true on a game Springfield and spirit lead Christian can keep up and above in this hour so it takes him so that's why God is calling us beyond church membership but your religious spirit to sound Sanders of God born again feel wouldn't let molecules so anyway they are going you live the word no doubt where you are standing who said are you talking about oddballs but Brown was speaking like that and say that he was working some way and it's so good looking he said okay let me come and look and see what they're saying so then you saw a man with him he has something for him and said I mean food for Christ so good way you know this man must be a fool for Christ indeed and then when he walk pass behind him says who is fool are you that's inside the question press a lot so I rather be if you focus on this side amen so you can be a fool for whatever or be a fancy for Christ so you can be a fancy for football fanatics Internet fanatics whatever they okay present Lord right oh I'm sorry let's just quickly go of course a motion I'm going to go through this today about a secret way the long lean and when he says stop now I love this story about Joseph for the Lord Joseph for standing for righteousness he went to trouble yeah so that is why you should not be discouraged when you're tried so low I do like him I'm not like the other people who are there I know the math sites working on you and me praise the Lord okay so we know this off juicer but let's just see professor what professor says have you ever stopped to think about it lovely to yourself what if he had given up and quit praying when he was in dungeon if any man has a right to quit on God and to give up because he was simile for second he told Joseph he was cussing to dungeon for taking a stand against him how could God allow him to be truth in prison when he had made such a courageous and loyal stand for God surely Joseph had a right to rebel and to be sly into a co-state after such a thing he could have he prayed and she believed for this furniture and looked to God's mighty hand to bring him out a burbs was was speaking here say Hammond of Pentecostal Holiness preachers would have held out like Joseph three long years in filthy but back infested dungeon with men of evil natures for constant company think of it three years long but he all gone to God he hung on to God he hung off up to prayer he didn't waver weeks went into months months into years still God didn't hear him out oh how you could have given up but no not yourself where's the Lord but do you know that US citizen you just a perfections in you hear that he was born again that's it he couldn't give up something within him cried out as it did with job don't you slay me yet will I trust you he hung on for three long years then God brought him out with a mighty hand you see the same today there are shot hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah my my my my so we have a way of escape and I got bored rich MSE has had designed that way for us amen and you can tell us now it's an open secret so you heard about it it's gonna operate to you again so Bourassa I will begin from Genesis at the beginning God gave human race his word 245 stronghold themselves from death from sin and sorrow at any disaster and if you describe this way a chain of his words thou shalt not touch this southern tree for the day you eat thereof that day you die and said it's a and it changes only it's best at its weakest link right and our souls are put over hell holding on this chain so you can imagine if if a part of this is weak he says hold over hell holding this chain break one of them that's all you have to do if not Brooke a sentence she brought the world my Satan that was the first book him in alright now alright when God provides he provides the best and when God provides Brian a wafer to fortify his church he provided the best when he gave Adam and Eve in the gander Aidan what eaten what what what the what he gave you gave them was his word you stay behind this world you are safe praise the Lord so I don't care what the economic disaster is ready to hit the wall you are tres if the Lord is what for us to be here and the squeeze that is where the thought pool we are manifested in fool so I need the rain I'm not a farmer kids whenever family I need when I cover as you please can you speak the word for me one day rain in my field praise the Lord so that is where we're coming to so fear not little flock that's a money here that can turn the light hallelujah oh that's Christ I mean Oh hallelujah so you sit behind this world and you are safe but if you get from out of look at it if you get art from out of it the day you eat thereof that you will die and God doesn't joke you know see loving God Obama say boy six of justice because that's no that's no law without justice is no good once a loving God that's how you're giving us the best hallelujah so he had so much change in strategy and Satan has no much changed his either how he got into Adam and Eve he gets into them today why he trying to risen it out now it's reasonable that go will just quit worry that was go will not o God has said does the devil say speaking to Eve said Satan but surely a holy God wouldn't do this surely he says surely he will because he said he would hallelujah wonderful and so he said the Bible said in first John to the three was Ray said build our holy but was a bitter holy even as your heavenly Father is holy and in first chakra three said and every manner has his hope purified himself law prepare me to be a sanctuary she'll run holy tried and true when you learned it on the computer right now going into into you know websites and things that you go nah prepare me to be a sanctuary but they work on cyclic this you say no no no that's not for me hallelujah go go to God Amy everyone that has this hope in him provide himself a min and look at what what Bertram talked about the official Church ish and love this was commending them he says that cannot be the evil which temperature evil those officiants that gods that those if you don't believe now God's people ought to be holy I come to this verse they took steps to keep the body the body on leaven from saying the the we're a separated people they have they have come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world and among them they will not put up with him in the church holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it is a way of life hallelujah mine and inside their apartment with vision our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of joy of the Lord so coming to church should not make you reasonable I mean a miserable I know forget it that was lie there's a lord my just think how God came down from glory for your sake and lay down his life and forgave you pay the price right and then in 896 came de himself it came down in the supernatural and appeared in the sky and this picture was taken by scientists what think of Barack Obama or the Braille is full of better and they know what scientists they were calling anybody knows who what this was about come on tell us what I would tell you when he came to you and I I said turn the picture whose face is that Christ hallelujah and Christ came he came down to get you Priscilla so it says the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when in service and the lies in his pleasures both prisons and the world are human yet both of emotions that's why that's why if my first time is when I'm in the church and don't put my Kotel a mess because if if if if if it God if rebelled Paso he's a home run ma he's out that word because certainly prison Oh hallelujah victory prison Oh hallelujah okay so physilog okay the difference is a Christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and it's long while the world satisfied the flesh others in the world the lust of the flesh lust of the eye pride of life money women men popularity we can sum it up there for the Lord and if in the Lahore is designed or dingo right and if that is not the case that may would actually find something to feel it that's why alcohol drugs name it and what is it what does it do it ends up destroying individual so that's why it's not covet the world don't think that that your classmates or work mate is having a good time he doesn't know the world you're living in so it's for you to prove to him or her that you in a better world come to my side I'm not gonna cut your side hallelujah oh my so that's cool so I was saying trying to make an illustration of you talking about this he said let no evil come into your mind all your thinking just dismiss it if it knocks at the door take it away just say just show your token just keep walking I am on the block remember there was there was a lot of them come by the women that might say hey Gertie Lilly some of you come out we are going to a party tonight have a good time what what does Christian Christian Taylor boy said I am under the blood I'm already talking to say here my love is my Mecca why because I know that death is on the land it's alone okay so here having a continuous City and the bread of just Christ is on our way to glory the money trains here don't be caught too late I would get the morning train the first one express one hallelujah wonderful praise the Lord so the pros were talking about on Exodus he said and their names are put in last book of life before different showing the world and they're in their elected and when that light splashes over them like that then the emotional walls drop away from them and here they come come out from among them said Holy Ghost in these last days touch not the unclean thing well I'll be good to you you misunderstood me now want to say so that's the weights again today God is calling amen so we're now we are now moved for the negative we're now going to the positive so what God is is doing now so we're not to touch members or or what how regulators and a group of God business to make it back to God when away it takes Lord give me grace Lord that we desire so that's weights again to their God is correlated people and they're later now and now they let if what for a resurrection and what kind of a science is showing is he showing them resurrection sign now he's showing the power of the resurrection this of his son living among us to resurrect them from the grave and grave yet that were in to the land that his promises was a sign going out of spiritual Egypt and switcher Babylon and as it was sorry as it wasn't days of Sodom so shall it be are they coming or sort of man so here we are we agree that we already in Sodom right and we can see this one of my water any iota of doubt came down Alleluia he finished with his prophet and took him home to rest because it's just too much we're human we have been to really carry on like this I add I fell for the Prophet he had a weight of responsibility I've got it so kind and took me away and the Pentecostals are wrong the amount I just came across something YouTube about the you know about Kenneth Hagen you know he said that that the Bahama trying to make himself a Nigel and he he he wrote he he's routing to do the paint and he didn't pan and go would take his life I said what did tommyrot for the Lord okay so when when they went in 1950 January when there was a challenge by was it doctor best to challenge the prophet and say you were false prophet or didn't the people that people are being healed and everything and then you know just to make to make from the prophet o so Paul was sitting at the back and he didn't you know want to come but somehow I was caught to come and pray and and the and they want to take the picture to see how you know try to disgrace the prophet everything and and the man got these photographers to take the pictures right you know the story and when this was developed we're going to come to a time just to tell my head on my cell but that's fine those all the spittle was taking no but nothing appeared all the Prophet would blow fire can I make that up supernatural prison or ampersand has normally a time after it happened from back there when the pillar of fire laden from from from Egypt to the promised land there's never appeared war and then afterwards we appeared and hit saw became Paul right has not happened before you see how CEO cities are privileged we are now when you pick a song book reading is not just your orders read a man is God I came down people to me sir - you are now to get us ready that songs you take your seniors and personal and say the latest will become flesh in me hallelujah now I got God is sovereign so even at your best info don't remain folly will do what stand off hallelujah oh praise the Lord okay so let's go as it wasn't this absurdum so shall it be any kind of the Son of man what kind of a sign the church's seat at Sodom what it is intellectual choice see to preachers what spiritual church elected Abraham - group so Abraham and his group saw God manifested in the body of flesh of human flesh that could descend the spirit until one said I was saying behind him yes and so what what did he do the first I saw like he's turned a profit please follow me another with the pillar of fire and he called the people out so the doors right blow fire a quad pull out that was the first Exodus and when Israel's time was up he sent again a God profit with a bill of fire John saw he descended from heaven like a dog and he said I go to God and I return to God after his death they run resurrection so love tattoos on his road to Damascus so that's simple of fire and him being a Hebrew well taught in the in the world in the world said Lord who are you praise the Lord and he knew it was the Lord and the pillar of fire he was a Hebrew so it was not a pure fire he was a Hebrews said who you and he said I am Jesus amen and the second and so does the second Exodus he brought the Prophet anointed with his son as Christ God prophet Moses said he would be a prophet and and had a pillar of fire and dongsaeng some wonders and that same prophet said the whosoever believeth in me the most I do shall he do also now number said he here here he probably the same thing in Exodus in the last days and he cannot change it he cannot changes and by scientific proof by witness of the spirit by the works of the Spirit we see today the great pillar of fire we will among us and science our wonders of the resurrection of Jesus Christ calling the people from the nationalism into the presence of Christ to leave go into a land here having a continued city to come praise the Lord so there's no mistake progress verse 8 is not what I'm saying so it's not man yeah I'm just your brother but I said but it's what God is proving to you what makes it's the truth simple of fire he used for the other two he's brought it among you today I'm proved by a scientific as you know that magazine package last month so on and so he said was asking how many how many were he and had me tell about what happened before what he did I think about every chart and here it is and there it is you don't know what's all about the scientists are trying to anybody who got a picture of it calling a cloud 20-20-20 six months high in the shape of peda means some angels president in here brought back and brought you to the world of God see so he brought us to the Word of God to get us to before matter what image and we're ready for the resurrection amen for the body change was a rush on the rapture we're beyond good church member maybe a good passive me to the black material going you said in the rest of the song let's say that as the bride needs a head soul she will form into the image and not to you now with him hallelujah and he says a great magnet coming down and the like I trust the legs in it so if you have a piece of metal here some wood piece of wood some iron and get mighty comes what does it do you are trully the iron right inside that's how it tastes what is coming and you have it in the role you have the word you are not transferred to a good church member you don't satisfy that your religious person you know satisfy about anything else what else you can look anything that you do is we're just given breathe in appreciation for God amen because our solutions are merited nothing we have done and that's what what to give our best I said no such my heart Lord oh prison or it just with these hours that we are not because we are coming and living in this which are mine we'll pick that right now see and get it it's an exodus we are going to leave one of these days amen thanks be to God verse a a mica which it tells me to go because we are living here as me there's no hope there would have been like wow we all will go from but another here we have no confused city a man starts to walk on the street and they would temps you say they will here have no continued city keep working on oh listen they dudes me so bad so bad what did it Oh hear about the koodoo city law I forgive I let it go let it go why because I have I have I have I have I have a place to go to heaven to go to prison or a may in that place as no sorrow that's no pain there's no bitterness that's no anger a man has to attempt are there for the Lord that's not going old MA no sickness here there's no job to attend to no school to go to right and so but here we got to do something or whatever should work we should work as if the Lord is coming in ten thousand years and we'll leave as it is coming let's minute hallelujah and he says it preachers preach as if it's going to be a last summer hallelujah Oh praise Allah so tell me - don't don't go we we have this so I'm going to rush now so bend a half and a half an hour's okay sorry just going to your lunch but they're with me I mean we didn't say is this launched here is some shots we were to go all right but this time glory to God the pillar the peel of the the pillar that was seen among us a pillar of fire will lead us to the millennium where he will return to his people in that great little ring after his Exodus where we will live eternally with him he always has a word of the father always proof that it is right so the facade of Purim summarizing what will he do he brought them out from natural language virtual.lab gonna seduce he brought them out from ass which were conditioned into a spiritual battle the Holy Ghost now he's bringing them from now now spiritual baptism of Holy Ghost right back into eternal land of many new and great hereafter simple on fire but it's an unnoticed system same God doing same things and the same world to clear the first one declared second one the same word declared the second declare someone had declared a third one and here we're here we see it among us amen and well cry luck come out or come out of this chaos and I believe many of us here he decried as over here Louie and oh stop by the sign say Lord never let a voice become veil my flesh hallelujah come out of this chaos camera go to living dog come to the word and the Word was made flesh and read among us now he is in our flesh join among us come out and serving God that's why he preached June 14 May this is before the unveiling of God and then June 29th and this is for say and say the mighty God all there before us oh praise the Lord hallelujah has a word right so if this determine could be dissolved we haven't all waited hallelujah I was selling things are to be now we are the end time the earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we're prepared to enter into heavenly and now we feel this strange call of God to go to this great Eden and before we can be born here our little bodies cried out what about natural birthright cried out in that he had to be provided all the afflicted child he if it wasn't and he said he bore has no official appear so that there everyone have a lined up and the bread just as that the groom was the words manifested in season just you the pride God grant tonight children each and every one of you first a heaven to go to and a hell to stay away from hallelujah now I'm just going to close now so recognizing your dearest message what I said now I'm going to say something national force put Israel in your homeland national force would put it church in the World Council of Churches so we're not about church about the bride hey man national force would put it church in welcome to council choice but the power of God we put upon the bride hey men the world forces this way and the workforce is that way but God forces [Applause] I'm going up I'm going up in the first resurrection hallelujah praise Allah is off the street of God which is the word of God which is what of God my word is spirit and life we put the bride in our place hey course she recognized a portion in the world that's it when you know got to add wood yeah and the heavy we'll pass it with had to pass away the work had not fail we talked about yourself so it doesn't matter how alingas the situation you were in they try the boolean true it doesn't matter God knows I can't even help you out you can help me either what he can pray for me go give me grace to go true but ultimately you had work pressure with him hallelujah as as he the master builder moves you amen prepare you preparing you and I hallelujah so she knows how position in the world she is in Christ she will put her arms then she's in Christ we put her in her place no not sure of course we do it connect what natural force did drive Israel to homeland national forces of the Council of Churches with drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into glory out of it so let's bow our heads and can you come and to play it very softly search me Oh Lord versed in modern events made clear by prophecy as it was in this of subtle socially BR the coming of the son of man when the Son
