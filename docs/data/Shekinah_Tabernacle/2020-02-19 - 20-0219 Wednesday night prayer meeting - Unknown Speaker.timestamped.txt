[12:09] tonight from sister Belinda god bless
[12:12] sister Belinda amen
[12:43] god bless you I just like to thank the
[13:06] Lord and just give a little testimony
[13:08] about some day and I just I was about
[13:13] five or ten minutes into the service and
[13:15] I just started crying I couldn't stop I
[13:17] didn't know what was going on and and
[13:20] then we had the word coming and the Lord
[13:23] just hitting so many things you know in
[13:26] there and it was just beautiful and then
[13:29] we had the prayer line happening and I
[13:31] heard brother Ben say some of you will
[13:33] have mined barrels of it you know and I
[13:36] didn't go up to the front to be prayed
[13:37] for but I also know the prophecies that
[13:40] Lord can even meet you in your seat and
[13:42] I thought of the woman that they touched
[13:45] the hem of Jesus garment you know he met
[13:48] her right there and for me I've never
[13:52] experienced anything like that I just
[13:56] stood there just worshiping the Lord and
[13:57] just praising him it was like I felt
[13:59] like a hand just touch me on my heart
[14:01] and just this was just from here just
[14:05] down the side here and it's been over
[14:08] two years where I had just had struggles
[14:10] with my heart and it was like a
[14:13] spiritual wound and I believe the Lord
[14:15] made me here that day and I just want to
[14:18] give him all the things the praises for
[14:21] his deliverance and this song this song
[14:25] he is called the restoration of the
[14:27] supernatural and thank you and I wrote
[14:33] it in 2011 our pastor preached about
[14:36] that and then it took me five years to
[14:39] complete it because the second part was
[14:41] missing but it's where the Prophet when
[14:44] that interpretation came about it French
[14:47] French people that interpreted in the
[14:49] cafe
[14:50] and he said because you have chosen the
[14:52] narrow path the harder way and you have
[14:56] not walked in your own choosing you have
[14:59] picked the correct and precise decision
[15:01] and it is my way because this momentous
[15:05] decision a huge portion of heaven will
[15:08] await thee
[15:09] what a glorious decision you have made
[15:12] this in itself is that which will give
[15:15] and may come to pass the tremendous
[15:18] victory in the love divine it's a
[15:22] promise to us
[15:32] [Music]
[17:43] every
[17:45] [Music]
[17:53] as well
[18:02] [Music]
[18:32] everybody's
[18:36] [Music]
[18:56] the natural
[19:02] expectation for the supernatural
[19:09] [Applause]
[19:16] [Music]
[19:18] god bless you sister Belinda I can be a
[19:23] witness to that I'm always on the
[19:25] expectation for the supernatural and
[19:28] unlike a God that that comes and can't
[19:31] prove himself he's Almighty Savior that
[19:34] the Conqueror the captain of the hosts
[19:36] supernaturals what'd he do it
[19:38] praise the Lord or just want to stand up
[19:41] let's sing how great is our God amen our
[19:46] supernatural God hallelujah they start
[19:50] with the chorus

[31:23] anyway let us let us tune open our
[31:28] Bibles and turn to 1 Corinthians 2 1
[31:35] Corinthians 2 and that should be in my
[31:38] my little slideshow show so I really I
[31:42] really didn't want to have a slideshow
[31:44] today was that me or you okay nice
[31:51] didn't want a title I just wanted to I
[31:55] was thinking you know how it goes you
[31:57] think in your head where you're gonna
[31:59] stand at the pool but I don't know if
[32:00] maybe it's just me were you going to
[32:03] stand at the pool but I just want to you
[32:05] know I just want to finish it and this
[32:08] is how you how I prepare and I think oh
[32:10] man I feel feel much more relaxed this
[32:13] time and all that men and then it dawns
[32:15] on me
[32:16] I mean nerves sit in and then but then
[32:20] then that's my sign to say or the Lord's
[32:22] got something in store yeah so I had to
[32:28] I had to think of a title I did just
[32:30] gave it a title the three P's I'll start
[32:34] as a motivational speaker the three P's
[32:36] pray purpose and position it just came
[32:39] to me that literally came to me last
[32:41] minute it's turned to the word shall we
[32:45] 1 Corinthians 2 from verse 1 and I
[32:51] breather when I came to you came not
[32:54] with excellency of speech or of wisdom
[32:56] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[32:58] for I determined not to know anything
[33:01] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[33:04] crucified and I was with you in meeting
[33:06] weakness and in fear and in much
[33:08] trembling exactly how I feel right now
[33:11] and my speech and my preaching was not
[33:13] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[33:17] in demonstration of the Spirit and of
[33:20] power that your faith should not stand
[33:22] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[33:24] God
[33:28] howbeit we speak wisdom with among them
[33:32] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[33:34] this world nor of the princes of this
[33:36] world that come to naught that we speak
[33:39] the wisdom of God and a mystery even the
[33:41] hidden wisdom which God ordained my
[33:45] brother man see today for deigned before
[33:47] the world unto our glory which none of
[33:50] the princes of this world knew for had
[33:53] they known it they would not have
[33:55] crucified the Lord of glory and we've
[33:58] would have missed this opportunity of of
[34:01] grace and of redeeming love but as it's
[34:05] written I have not seen no ear heard and
[34:09] thank you so much for sister Belinda
[34:11] because this is where it's fitting in
[34:12] with her song neither have entered into
[34:15] the heart of man we're just thinking of
[34:18] the supernatural thinking of this
[34:20] amazing we cannot even fathom that in
[34:23] this little heart of ours the things
[34:28] which God hath prepared for them that
[34:30] love them
[34:31] yea may God bless his word you may take
[34:35] your seats I just had a little reference
[34:37] there of Isaiah so that's where it's
[34:40] saying as it's written I love it when
[34:43] and that that's maybe another sermon on
[34:46] another time but love it with Jesus just
[34:48] kick devil in his teeth with with the
[34:51] Old Testament
[34:53] he doesn't he didn't even have to you
[34:55] know he was the new Desmond at that
[34:56] point it's just lovely so yeah okay and
[35:05] the pictures are they just for the kids
[35:06] I not for the adults just kidding okay I
[35:11] just want to take yep okay so I wanted
[35:18] to purposefully keep this short
[35:20] I wanted to purposefully have not a lot
[35:22] of time in front here because this power
[35:24] and prayer we've seen this now we've
[35:28] we've seen it on Sunday what a wonderful
[35:30] service and the opening that brother Ben
[35:33] had here the pulpit and just people
[35:35] coming pouring out and I'm pouring back
[35:39] in you know spurred and it was lovely
[35:42] and then and and I I'm starting to
[35:45] treasure this way I've listened to
[35:49] brother Loney's testimony and was
[35:52] referring to at some point ways he's
[35:55] praying and he's reading the word and
[35:58] he's connecting the dots and he's seeing
[36:00] that but if it's written and if I'm his
[36:04] then it will happen you know ask and you
[36:08] will receive right so he was not praying
[36:11] from a faith of and again I might repeat
[36:16] someone's other sermons and an
[36:18] expectation of or hope a hope so faith
[36:21] he was expecting it because he read it
[36:24] in the word it's a Living Word Christ
[36:27] that yesterday the same and today and
[36:30] forever and he's just taking at that
[36:33] he's expecting that healing he's
[36:37] expecting that change of heart he's
[36:39] expecting the demons to flee and that's
[36:43] that's just his faith and that's how it
[36:45] how it all starts and this is I think
[36:50] where we're going back to pre purpose
[36:54] and position trying to find my own
[36:57] individual walk in our body in our
[37:00] members trying to find my place so I've
[37:04] got a few hats a few positions but
[37:06] what is the Lord trying to tell me and
[37:09] and doesn't matter where that is
[37:12] I need to have that faith right so I'm
[37:16] part of the Bride and part of the body
[37:18] doesn't matter what's my title
[37:19] I've got thus saith the Lord so I can
[37:23] pray a fervent prayer I can go to the
[37:25] word and can say Lord this is what
[37:28] you've said I'm praying this I'm
[37:30] standing by this I've seen this work
[37:32] thank you lord brother Armand Johnson
[37:35] jump the gun slightly where is this a
[37:37] mini of water I need to sing that again
[37:42] I was I'm singing that because you know
[37:45] we're fishing and it's raining and I'm
[37:47] thinking Lord that water tank is filling
[37:50] yeah he's got the perfect time right and
[37:53] that's just another testimony small big
[37:56] whatever what the Lord placed on your
[37:58] heart the names that came on our little
[38:01] Watts have group tonight that's the
[38:02] that's the names we need to pray for and
[38:04] that we will pray for and we will pray
[38:06] with faith as an expectation we will get
[38:09] something right so coming back to I
[38:14] didn't want to take long because I want
[38:16] to give more time to pray I'm going to
[38:18] spend time in prayer I'm seeing change
[38:21] in my life I seem change in your lives I
[38:23] I see they're they're entering into a
[38:26] new spiritual realm is that only said
[38:30] realm South Africans struggle they right
[38:38] so we have men and women in our church
[38:41] that's got that that's growing in
[38:44] stature okay and I'm not even talking
[38:48] about the adults I'm not even talking
[38:50] about that all the sisters the ministers
[38:52] the Deacons the technicians I'm talking
[38:55] about the young ones that's getting to a
[38:58] place of perfect rest of harmony of
[39:03] getting into a channel quicker I'm
[39:05] seeing growth spiritually from younger
[39:08] ones coming to the fore coming giving
[39:12] everything to him because it works it is
[39:15] as simple as that and
[39:19] connecting the dots there sometimes you
[39:22] would say the only thing I can do is
[39:26] pray for him for her for the disease or
[39:29] whatever now I want to switch that so
[39:31] back in service here for Christ when I
[39:34] did that 99 and 2000 we I was very
[39:39] philosophical brother Jimmy I think you
[39:42] at that point now you you see the world
[39:46] in a different eye and I like that
[39:47] because I see myself in you so I can
[39:50] relate but I wrote all these little
[39:52] motivational things all this little
[39:54] one-liners you know that the big the
[39:57] bigwigs wrote you know and but one of
[39:59] them stuck thank goodness
[40:03] is it me that's popping and buzzing and
[40:06] cracking maybe I should not hit it okay
[40:14] I'll stand still where was I so the one
[40:20] thing stuck in and I praise God for this
[40:22] is pray does not equip us for the
[40:25] greater work pray is the greater work
[40:28] and I think sometimes we just we miss
[40:31] the boat we want to have all these gifts
[40:33] and all these stuff happen prayers where
[40:37] it starts is you start on your knees you
[40:39] start right at the bottom if it happens
[40:43] again we'll do a switch I'll put the
[40:46] stopwatch unemployment and see how quick
[40:48] we can do a tire change I mean a mic
[40:50] change
[40:51] thank you brother a month yes it doesn't
[40:56] it it is the greater work it is that's
[40:58] where it happens that's where why we
[41:01] have a wall room we have we have a
[41:03] prayer room that's why things are
[41:05] happening that's why we diligently on
[41:07] our post praying praying and praying and
[41:10] praying and and I pray to God that I
[41:12] have that in in my inner sanctuary in my
[41:16] home and my you know prayer closer than
[41:18] my time with the Lord so coming back to
[41:22] well you say the only thing I can do is
[41:25] pray why not change that to the only
[41:28] thing I do is pray
[41:32] or all I do is pray oh the one thing I
[41:38] can do is pray so that's bold italic the
[41:45] the only thing I can do I can't sing I
[41:48] can't play an instrument I can't be a
[41:50] technician I can pray I want to get to
[41:54] that point
[41:56] so now let's let's go and this is this
[41:59] is putting it practically I've just got
[42:02] pictures and then we can relate to I can
[42:05] relate to my head the story so two
[42:08] recent testimonies from me a former
[42:13] colleague of trying not an engineer
[42:15] named we when I started my company where
[42:20] I am now we met all the lady and and and
[42:24] and she she's got her who she likes and
[42:29] who she doesn't like you know so I'm
[42:31] sitting next to her we call it the hub
[42:32] so before you get placed out as a
[42:34] consultant to clients and all that you
[42:36] need to learn the ins and outs and be
[42:38] all professional and wear a llama tie
[42:40] you like my llama time yeah
[42:41] thank you brother benefits and so
[42:48] chitchat yakking away yawning and and I
[42:51] and and she mentioned something about
[42:54] horse riding farming hunting cars and I
[42:57] thought oh this is Mike yet I can relate
[42:59] I can talk to her yeah started talking
[43:02] she smokes and all that kind of thing
[43:05] and time goes by so she said she starts
[43:10] liking me and I like her you know I I
[43:12] like it when I get through to someone
[43:14] you know you sort of yeah you know the
[43:19] Lord is working in you and and thinking
[43:21] it's just see past the veneer you know
[43:24] this she's hiding something there's a
[43:26] there's something there for a reason and
[43:28] she's he's all you know cross with
[43:31] everyone and and you know short and you
[43:33] know and I'm just checking you know and
[43:36] they probably the people can't
[43:37] understand why am i you know finding her
[43:40] so interesting and we can chat so lack a
[43:43] you know so that goes on for a while
[43:46] I get placed out to a client I try to
[43:48] email her and say hey how's it going and
[43:49] she's doing me in this and I see she's
[43:51] jumping around a bit between clients and
[43:53] I thought okay and sort of all inquired
[43:57] the communication and and then the next
[44:00] thing I heard she left the company okay
[44:03] in my mind make that a little notice
[44:06] I'll try and keep contact with her and
[44:09] and she lifts up my way as well kept
[44:12] video so on
[44:13] poppin for a coffee and meet the family
[44:14] you know and I knew she had this little
[44:17] sport cars and everything you know my
[44:19] boys would like it if she comes in and
[44:20] and and stop there for a coffee with her
[44:23] with a nice little green oak or
[44:25] something like that and then I think it
[44:30] was just after the new we were just
[44:32] before sorry just before the new year
[44:33] yeah that's right I thought let me
[44:38] contact her again let me let me email
[44:40] her again and see how it goes and you
[44:43] know cookie
[44:44] my my my cookie self and you know how's
[44:46] it going and you know christmas is
[44:47] coming and what have you planned and she
[44:51] said nah oh I asked about her car I
[44:53] asked about a car and she said no she
[44:57] hasn't done that she doesn't have money
[44:59] for a wolf and all this kind of thing I
[45:01] thought oh that's odd is it all you know
[45:03] maybe I could take it in or something on
[45:05] and she sees now she's she's severely
[45:08] depressed and she can't leave the house
[45:10] and and all this kind of thing now
[45:13] backtracking just a bit probably a year
[45:15] before that I I got woken up wire by a
[45:19] phone call of a very good friend of mine
[45:21] and he was he was crying he was it was
[45:25] beside himself and I've never seen him
[45:27] like that and he and he and he struggled
[45:30] with this depression as well
[45:31] and missed my my whole carpool I miss my
[45:34] club you know they were parked outside
[45:36] and honking and trying to call me and
[45:38] I'm on the line with this maid of mine
[45:41] not to break the line not to not to let
[45:45] him go not to make him second priority
[45:47] I'm saying Lord he's found me you know
[45:51] why me so there's something there right
[45:54] looking in hindsight I had the identity
[45:59] I
[45:59] I had what is in me I knew what's my
[46:03] foundation on so he immediately this
[46:06] guy's is walking the straight and the
[46:09] narrow so anyway she she replies with
[46:15] that and immediately I could enter in
[46:18] and say I'm gonna pray for you if you
[46:23] don't mind I'm gonna pray for you right
[46:26] and I don't she did reply and I thought
[46:31] okay Lord yeah and I think it might have
[46:34] been one of our prayer services
[46:36] I really lifted it up and said Lord this
[46:40] is you know I'm exactly the opposite of
[46:43] a of a depressed individual I I cannot
[46:47] in the even into that burden but I don't
[46:52] want I don't even want my enemy to be
[46:54] depressed
[46:55] I want thing to to have love and liberty
[46:57] in and enjoy unspeakable you know I
[47:01] don't deserve this
[47:02] please Lord just give a disc evoke a
[47:05] glimmer of hope just you know that light
[47:08] in the tunnel and that's why I chose the
[47:09] rays of light coming through the clouds
[47:11] is that brother Branham refers to the
[47:13] clouds of sometimes you know as doubts
[47:15] and trying to get into the in the way of
[47:17] the of the s/o in and yeah so I'm got
[47:23] time went by and I think I think I
[47:27] started the conversation again hey how's
[47:29] it going and although oh no no actually
[47:31] she did she out of her own emailed me
[47:34] and said you won't believe it I forgot a
[47:38] dog I'm begging workforce and all that
[47:40] kind of thing I said that is indeed good
[47:43] news and this is how my new year starts
[47:45] just off there or a little camp we came
[47:47] back and this is what I receive I
[47:49] thought oh Lord you are you know I'm I'm

[47:54] bubbling and maybe it's boiling in me
[47:57] man and I was I was Jubilate him just

[48:04] this is the Lord you know she she

[48:19] came and and and touched it touched a
[48:23] sow and this is what she what she sin

[49:31] wife you know we would always be at each
[49:33] other you know but we give the work done
[49:36] we work really well together so time
[49:39] passed probably a year but we still work
[49:42] in the same big project team and he
[49:47] comes so we we started having maybe
[49:50] shouldn't say that there's too loud but
[49:52] Zee garage has got a nice premium
[49:55] sausage roll
[49:56] it says sometimes spoil myself so me and

[50:21] what he all my family members are
[50:24] becoming Christian what are you doing in
[50:26] you know

[51:05] Sunday so I don't even reply you know he
[51:09] knows you know so anyway so we walking
[51:12] and he's trying to tell me now about his
[51:14] sister his sister has his doing this
[51:18] Daniel fasting he wants to know but more
[51:20] I said well the fasting the nutritional
[51:22] the diet side is one thing but man
[51:26] there's stuff behind that where it all
[51:28] started the root of why Daniel went on
[51:31] this far so I mean you can you can get
[51:34] lost and in the book of Daniel we all
[51:36] know this but um so you wanted the long
[51:38] and short I said Nana okay what what we
[51:43] do yeah so so she she became a Christian
[51:47] she's not doing this Daniel fasting I
[51:50] said so is she married
[51:51] is it as a husband Christian I said no
[51:55] she Hindu I said no I said so
[51:59] are they recently married no they
[52:01] married for 20 years or something I said
[52:04] whoa so now my mind goes oh I've got a
[52:07] bro I know a guy he's been there he's
[52:10] got a testimony and it's touched me and
[52:13] sucks my life so now I've got a burden
[52:17] for what she must go through now wow
[52:20] this is this is the magnitude he's
[52:23] probably not even you know see no and
[52:27] and I tell them this I say listen you
[52:31] need to get behind what what's driving
[52:34] her and ask her he said well how do i
[52:38] you know wait I said okay
[52:40] I said we as Christians we would ask one
[52:44] another tell me your testimony this is
[52:47] now me so tell your sister I will pray
[52:50] for her she's gonna pray for you we are
[52:53] all gangster like that you know this is
[52:55] how I talk to him so forgive my language
[52:59] but you know ah and he just he just last
[53:03] but in reality I'm I'm praying for his
[53:07] sister she's gonna pray for a family
[53:09] absolutely if what I know is she's gonna
[53:13] she's gonna be on her knees so that all
[53:15] the sister thinks he's 60 she's been a
[53:17] Christian for I don't know 30 or years
[53:19] so now all of a sudden there's the shift
[53:21] in the end and the family and because
[53:24] they close you know I just found that
[53:27] you know fascinating there oh okay he's
[53:30] come to me again
[53:31] he's like what is this you know what so
[53:34] we've got other colleagues it's also
[53:35] Christian you know it's maybe not
[53:37] walking the walk where I am but God rich
[53:41] in mercy so he came so he can he can
[53:44] talk to me about that and I can come and
[53:47] pray and I can and I know that my Maker
[53:50] will ask and you will receive right I
[53:54] just want to check my notes if I've
[53:57] touched on everything that I was
[53:58] supposed to and then I'll go into this
[54:01] at all yep
[54:08] so they were too small 1953 demonology
[54:14] no matter how much teaching you got you
[54:17] can drum that into you God is not in big
[54:20] words God isn't an honest heart you
[54:23] might stand there speak big words like I
[54:25] don't know what that doesn't bring you
[54:27] closer to God I I can't even speak
[54:29] proper English thank you Lord for that
[54:32] because then you can work through it you
[54:35] can stand and practice how to repeat
[54:36] your servant and say these things that
[54:38] don't get closer to God you can learn
[54:40] dictionary wall till you sleep with one
[54:42] and still wouldn't get you closer to God
[54:44] a humble submitted heart in the
[54:47] simplicity is what brings you to God and
[54:50] that's true amen a humble God God loves
[54:54] now no matter if you don't know your
[54:57] ABCs that don't make any difference just
[55:00] a humble heart
[55:01] why is he repeating this God dwells in a
[55:04] humble heart not an education not in
[55:07] schools not in theology seminaries or
[55:10] seminaries I can carry on just ahead
[55:12] recently some some stuff thrown at me
[55:18] around seminaries and how they want to
[55:21] depict the word and then yeah God dwells
[55:26] in a human heart and the lower you can
[55:28] break yourself down the more simple you
[55:31] can become greater in the sight of God
[55:32] let me give you something I see your
[55:35] fields are full of wheat are they a full
[55:38] head of weed always bounce a little low
[55:41] spring sticks up there and flopping
[55:43] around like it knows everything
[55:45] it ain't got it in the head that's the
[55:48] way with a lot of these guys that think
[55:51] they got a lot in their head and nothing
[55:53] in their heart they a holy head will bow
[55:56] to the power they recognize Jesus Christ
[55:59] as the Son of God and believe his works
[56:02] oh God
[56:05] how wonderful it is to come and I'm not
[56:09] saying I'm a mature wheat but I come I
[56:13] want to bow and I want to pray because I
[56:15] know it works come with a humble heart I
[56:18] I know no other because I
[56:21] on bose than anything so yes that's my
[56:24] little sermonette god bless you for
[56:28] listening and give me some grace and all
[56:31] my broken up English I know we've got a
[56:34] few a few prayer requests so maybe I
[56:40] should open the floor if there's
[56:41] anything else any other prayer
