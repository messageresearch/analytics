[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] now this song is called telephone to glory [Music] god is just as far from you as your mobile how many [Music] years ago mobile phones didn't exist we didn't worry about them because we didn't know them oh you could go anywhere we didn't worry about it then there was a time when you wouldn't go about without a watch on your hand you needed to check the time but before that you know what we did in the villages our grandmothers they'll dig some holes and they watch the shadow from the heart when it reaches a certain hole they know exactly it's 10 o'clock now and when it moves to the other hole they know it's half they survived there was no problem and then we came to watches so if you went around without a watch you'd feel naked where's my watch then we came to a time where you don't leave your mobile behind you jump in your car you want to go to work something tells you something's not right i forget something you didn't forget the lunch box or your big or anything but you forgot something you can't go because you forgot something you know what it is a mobile phone even when you're taking a shower the mobile phone is in the shower with you by could also attach to your mobile phones now this song says god is just as close to you you just telephone him if you need anything anything just telephone to glory there are no secretaries where you phony they're told oh he's in a meeting can you phone again in 20 minutes time then you phone again say oh he's still in another meeting oh it's like this now you just phone direct to glory he's always there he is the one who will answer you so whatever you need there are no secretors there there's no red tap whatever time it is 3 am 5 am you just talk to him and tell him what you need so this song is an encouragement telephone to glory [Music] [Applause] oh what your divine i can feel his current moving on the line built by the father foreign [Music] fail to get an answer satan's crushed your lie by some strong delusion or some their desire take away destruction god is on the throne [Applause] [Music] i can feel the current moving on [Music] nations cannot get control of this line to glory and cut in the soul hallelujah [Music] i can feel his current moving on [Music] if your line is grounded if your line is grounded and connections too have been lost with jesus tell you what to do pray our faith and promise means your [Music] i [Music] you may talk to jesus i will sing that last face again if your line is grounded and connections too have been lost with jesus tell you tell you what to do pray [Music] oh our joy divine i can feel the current moving on the line building the father for his love and known [Music] so if your line is grounded you're trying to talk to jesus the devil is fighting you don't worry keep pressing on the song says tell you what to do your line is grounded the connection is lost somewhere don't give up prayer faith and promise look at the promise he made this line specially for you it's a royal line you're queen esther you are the wife of the king you don't ask for permission to give the king to visit him when he's on his throne you just go direct and touch the scepter queen esther you are the wife you've got a special privilege what is it my queen touch my scepter what is it you want from me because you are the queen so prayer faith and promise means your broken line so keep praying don't give up you are mending that connection that line that the devil is trying to stop faith do you still have faith that's why we're here that's why the people are watching the service because they believe in that line prayer faith and promise every promise in the pool is mine every chapter every verse and every life i am

brother honest thank you musicians amen great to see everyone here today praise the lord it's good to be back in church again it's like to say thank you very much to brother matt sister priscilla for opening their home by the insisted landi for armand sister chantal being the cappity crew holding the fort amen while we're all down with covert which is not fun by the way um yeah but thank you for your prayers and um you know thank you very much everyone over the company holding the forward and um hey god bless you all yeah it's good to be good to be here i'm sorry zoom's not working the the computer that runs it packed up so we've got to get another one but yeah god bless you how's everyone today everyone's happy amen good to be a christian today i mean every day is good to be a christian isn't it amen um amen yeah just want to uh keep the saints in the ukraine and and russia and your prayers we've sent two thousand dollars u.s to the saints in the ukraine via brother barry coffee so we'll keep helping them but i'm so blessed by the testimonies that have come out there god stepping on the scene and how these what i love well i mean all the testimonies and testimonies are amazing but what i love about the one how they see there's such literal hatred in the country but the believers just feel divine love and to me that's incredible not to be caught up in the atmosphere there amen but yeah i love the testimonies of the bombs dropping and not going off and people getting off buses at early times and you know you know that sister was working at the school she left work early there's a bomb drop she didn't get coordinated she's on a bus going home and she gets off two stops early and and she come to find out when she got to a real bus stop a bomb had dropped there and she if she got there if she stayed on the bus she would have been caught up in that explosion and the lord just looks after his children amen but we want to keep them in prayer because it's a very difficult environment amen but let's just go to the scripture first let's go to i've got a slideshow um here slideshows have never been my friend but hey it's a good time to make friends so let's just see how this goes i want to um i want to talk about lies i said a couple of um a couple of sundays ago you know i'm going to preach on lies and you know i i was really blessed by brother isaac's service he was kind of trampling all over real i wanted to go and i now i know what it's like for the shoe to be on the other foot you know because some brothers say i was going to preach on there why are you preaching you know so but the lord has a mind right so i'd like to say i'm thank you to brother andy too for the service on wednesday um so i'm going to try and drive this from here we're going to read a couple of portions here there's revelations 21 if you've got your bibles handy um and we're going to read verses 7 and 8 and then also verse 27 then we're going to go to proverbs chapter 6. um i just want to keep in your mind how a few sundays ago i preached on how the devil has no pardon us and lies are the devil we have no pardon lies lies have no part in us amen but so um i just i just we'll see how this goes so he says here he that overcometh shall inherit all things i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so notice his and all lies not some but all and revelations 21 27 and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life i mean so if your name is written in the lamb's book of life you'll come to a point in your journey you will stop lying i'll just say that amen now rev uh proverbs 6 here oh you wait i've got a okay proverb 6. um and you know the the bible is full of god cannot stand a lie he cannot stand a lie and uh if the devil is the father of lies which we'll read but we have no part in him then how can lies be in us right so um i just pray the lord just be real personal you know because i preached to myself too you know this is not just to you know proverbs 6 and 16. these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination under him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and heart that devises wicked imaginations feet that be swift and running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren amen let's just bow heads and word of prayer you're going to be remembering the prayers and raise your hands to the lord amen this is a very important time to be alive gracious father we thank you we can be gathered here in this way lord we want to magnify your name lord not just in song but in our lives lord everything we say do and think might glorify you may i give you praise and honor and glory because you deserve all the honor praise and glory my god father we've read your word lord your sacred word lord i pray you just come as you being the great author i'm so glad we can invite you lord into our midst and we can ask lord may you make your word live lord we haven't come to hear some intellectual seminar or anything like that my god we've come lord that you would minister to our hearts you'd make us more like you you would purge anything that's not of you out of our lives lord jesus that you would lift us higher and stabilize our walk or may just have your way for your glory dear god those who are connected by the way of youtube lord i pray you'll be very present in there in their homes wherever they may be o god may speak to them as well lord may change all our lives that we're more like your word grounded father in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats uh this morning so yes so as we've read here you know the lord says lies are abomination there's six things but it says here a lying tongue but then in verse 19 a false witness that speaks lies and we've read here in in revelations 21 that you know all lies will end up in the lake of fire this is real serious amen and all that maketh a lie will not enter in so i believe we're not called to fulfill that part of the scripture right i believe that the lord has given us an entrance by his supreme grace amen to to to dwell in the new jerusalem i mean too to dwell in eternity for eternity amen that yeah our names are written in the last book of life but we need to realize that so lies are a serious thing now when we think about lies and and i'll come to this later we think all these white lies and there's black lies and there's like a spectrum of lies but god looks at it all the same you know our human reasoning we like to quantify things since oh that's worse than this and this and this and you know but you know sin is sin god views it all the same he doesn't view oh this is a bit worse and this is a bit no it's all the same to him and so now we need to see where lies come from because we've got to realize that we uh you know we are we are reflecting uh either heaven or hell right and and we know that with our first birth i mean there's a lot of the devil in us that needs to get out right by our by our fallen nature that we're born with now we know we you know you know these bodies are not changed when we receive the new birth we're looking for a body change and this flesh will war against the spirit but if we stay a lamb stay surrendered amen then then this thing will stay in subjection to the spirit of god within us amen and that's that's what the that's what i love about the power of the blood is it actually gives us overcoming power not just to suppress things by our own human ability but actually to destroy it out of our lives and give us overcoming power over it i mean that we can walk in victory now jesus would say to the scribes and pharisees he says you do the deeds of your father then they said then said they to him we are are not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceed forth and come from god neither came i have myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now notice they could hear it audibly but there's nothing in them to hear it i mean in their souls year of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it amen so if the devil is the father of lies i don't want to be producing any of his his deeds right my father's god right i trust you've come to a place in your walk where where the spirit of god has come upon you where you cry abba father or my father my father you realize god is your father i mean you're his child you're his offspring so if you're his offspring you'll begin to manifest him right because children are made in the image of their parents amen sometimes you look down at them and you see your own fallen nature you say i'm sorry you inherited that one but the thing is the lord can overcome that in their lives and the same thing in our lives we don't have to live or put up with our fallen nature i mean but the lord by the power of his blood can actually kill that thing give us overcoming power i mean so the devil the devil's the father of lies now we know he wasn't made a liar in the beginning but in his own beauty and majesty that he has created pride into the iniquity as i've got highlighted there he says that was perfect in thy ways from the day that i was created till iniquity was found in me so before iniquity was found in him i say the devil wasn't the father of lies but because he got so lifted up in pride in how god had made him and his perfection and his beauty and you know all of his attributes iniquity came into his heart and then so he begin to think now i can do this better than god can and and and this is this is the biggest problem humanity has is we think we can do a better job than god can and you notice the world is is is is just a finger push to to total annihilation because man thinks they can do it better than god can right just like how brother abraham said the problem that you know preached a sermon the invasion of the united states he says the invasions happened you know the devil came in you know you know via hollywood he invaded the country and invaded the pulpit invade all those things you know invaded the home and he said the reason is because of weak pulpits because man thought i can do this better than god can in other words they'll take their their their bible school idea and what their counsel of elders say above the word of god and what they're saying is we can do it better than god can we can't do it better than god can god's way is the best way and the only way amen so so satan thought now i can do it better than you know god and so he begin to spin a tell a tale to actually cause other angels to fall with him because he thought he could do better than god can amen so i'm just showing you how this is where lies come from and if we have no pardon the devil and the devil has no part in us we shouldn't be lying right but you see iniquity came into him now this is the same thing with human beings there's a fallen attribute is there and it produces something god purges right now amen now the devil cannot create the devil can only pervert what uh the devil only perverts what god created that's the only there's only one creator that's god what is a lie is a truth misrepresented what is a bad woman it's a good woman that's been perverted see anything that's perverted perverters of the devil anything in its original condition is of god see god is the only creator and the devil cannot create he has to pervert what god has created he says keep that in your mind so a lie is the truth misrepresented so the devil misrepresented truth to the other angels and those ones that actually came under the influence of his lie fell amen now we don't want to come into that category but here we have in revelations 12 he says here there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her crown was crowd of ten stars now i'm not going to go into all the symbolic nature of this but it's going to come down to verse 14. and she being with child created cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered there appeared another wonder in heaven behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and to cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born now we know the book of revelation it's a book of prophecy it's a book of symbols so there's not literally going to be a great big red dragon physically in in space going to drag a third part of the stars and cast them to the earth right this is symbolic in nature and what this is is the devil because all he can do is misrepresent the truth to tell a lie that's all he can do so he told the devils he preached to the other angels around him a lie to get them to to side with him to side with the iniquity that was already within him to to project that to to the other angels and what he did he actually his tail and and brother brown says here it's not literally his physical tale a t-a-i-l but a t-a-l-e which is a lie right he says he says you know so that's getting a bit small well hold on he says here now you know that what it was now his tail wasn't like a fork tail like they say the devil has got it it was that tail that lie that he told and the very jews by the roman empire crucified the lord jesus and over two-thirds of the jews denied jesus christ the stars which was in heaven and watch what he did and he cast now he's reading that scripture we read and he cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as as it was born now you say the dragon had something to do with the jews certainly they said this jesus says he's the king we have no king but caesar that's right see the devil's preparing them jewish hearts back there to deny jesus christ when he come can you see the devil denying hearts today to deny the power of the holy ghost when he come just exactly the same yet honest and sincere amen so the devil uses a tale to cause people to fall into a lie because it started in him and he wants to spread it right but you see now what so so it comes to tell a tale to deny the power of the holy ghost so if the devil gets in your mind you can never be free you can never change how you think you can never be free of something maybe or was in your grandparents and your parents are now in you and you cannot be free of it and you could argue just stuck this way you fall into sin and there's no way you can get out of that pit that's a lie and there's a devil trying to get you to deny the power of the holy ghost i mean because there's nothing that god cannot deliver a person from there's there's nothing i mean he can deliver from everything all all sin all bondage all lies all deception our god he says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so there's power and the truth to free you and there's no sub-clauses of what can be freed from and what cannot be freed from no ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen i'm so glad we are living in a day and now where the spirit of truth has come the lord jesus christ and he's caused you to know him and there's a power in him to free you who's been freed amen by the spirit of truth hallelujah so never ever let the devil course he'll try and tell you you've gone too far you've gone too long you've said too much wrong you've done you've done all these things look at these scars and problems and whatever more you can never be free that's a lie that's a lie from the pit of hell amen that's the devil trying to make you deny the power of the holy ghost amen but you see that's what the devil does he wants to misrepresent the truth that people can never be free now the devil's tactics have never changed his tactic has always been to try and put enough doubt upon the truth to make people disbelieve it that's always been his tactic and he's always bombarded with questions to make people doubt now satan satan in in in heaven told the tale and he basically put he could only pervert what god has done so he so so he lied to the angels a third of them fell by that tale and now because iniquity was found in his heart he projected this and then now here he comes down into the garden via the serpent and the first thing that's recorded that is said is a question yeah hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the god he puts a question did that really happen did that miracle did brother brown really do this did he really go there why did this happen why did this do it's just all question question question but there's nothing for the there's no alternative there's no greater truth greater love greater joy greater reality of god today so he says yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden so so he takes what god has said and perverts it just a little bit because god told them you know of the tree and knowledge of good and evil in the midst of god you shall not eat right so he took a lot of truth and put a lion there but he's just getting he's just trying to put enough doubt in eve's mind that she'll depart from the truth and take his lie see if the devil can get you to doubt then he's got you and the devil said i'm sorry and this woman said unto the serpent we may not we may eat of the tree uh fruit of the trees of the garden but of the tree but of the fruit of the tree which in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall ye shall not surely die so god doesn't really he didn't really mean what he said you know society's moved on and you know things have changed and opinions change and he's not really going to do what he said god's going to do what he said amen if god is really going to rapture people he's not going to no he's really going to take us off the earth he's really going to change these bodies so if he's really going to do that he's going to do the other side as well amen so i'm glad you know i'm glad there's a rapture for us i'm glad there's mercy i'm glad there's the blood amen now so you shall surely not die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be gods knowing good and evil now they already were gods they were gods over the earth god told adam have dominion this is yours subdue it do what you want you are you are so they already work gods do they need to know evil no i don't think so you know that and you know that's what the devil wants to do to us you know oh you're too sheltered tries to open our imaginations in the wrong way too early with sex and different things you know try and push it down our throats young people try oh you need to know evil do you why don't you just know the good it's just like someone who who um who's an expert in in in picking up counterfeit dollars you know how they do that they study the true enough they can pick up a counterfeit right and it should be the same thing with us why do we need to you know see all the evil out there and say oh yeah this is what no no just look at the good i would rather live without the scars and i wish i never saw that amen but god allows that because you know he wants to give us victory now so so it's just yeah hath god said is this really how it should be who's following me today he just wants to bombard with questions did this really happen did that happen listen i don't need to go find um the ark to believe the noah and the flood happened oh but there's photos yeah in this photoshop what are you getting at but i don't need to go find it i don't need to go i don't need to go to jerusalem and see where zion is and see where david and did all these things i don't where is goliath skeleton i don't need to do that to believe that david killed that guy with a sling and cut his head off with his own sword i don't need all the relics to believe it jesus said blessed are you if you've never seen yet belief right so it's the same thing you know i don't need to go see where martin luther did all those things to believe that happened right oh it's been documented really oh you can't believe history anymore see the devil wants to put oh what up brother bram and different things well no no i don't need to go there and find everything to believe it happened why because i know and whom i have believed he introduced me to the god of the bible jesus christ and i know in whom i have believed i mean so so so my relationship with jesus christ is not based on what other people say i mean it's like if someone would come to me and tell me you know christine isn't really what you think she is and try and give all this evidence and you know if i never was married to her and live with her and and knew her i could maybe doubt you know her and believe them but because i'm married to her i'm in love with her i know her i mean i can say no what you're telling me is a lie because i have a relationship with the one you're trying to destroy amen it's the same thing with jesus christ i say this message is false and lies no no hold on it reveals jesus christ in the scripture amen it reveals i see jesus christ in the scripture it makes the bible alive to me and more than just wow look at that type and shadow no i see the god of the bible live in me which should be the purpose of that's what god wants to do living you and i but the devil puts questions and questions and this and this and you know i hold on and and you can see it with with with everything that's trending in the world today you know people put questions on vaccines for and against right or mandates for the yo they want to put enough questions out there you know and it's just but it's a it's the same spirit now we're not to be caught up in those things we're above those things right we are on our way to glory amen calling whosoever will come with it's wonderful amen now um see and and so basically the devil he just wants to ask the question like like i said a you know a while ago brother kaijo brought this out to a youth meeting he you know your delilah basically said to samson tell me how i can destroy you i want my payday tell me i'm gonna pretend i love you no i just want i just want a few silver coins tell me how i can destroy you because the devil doesn't care how he just wants to destroy you right so so he say pray tell me i pray that we're in our great strength life and wherewith thou must be bound to afflict me delilah didn't care what she had to do she would have done it to find his source of strength to destroy him and it's the same thing with the devil today he don't care how he gets you as long as he gets you as long as he gets you to away from the truth he he doesn't mind how it's going to happen he just wants it to happen amen so this is how the devil works you know it's the same thing with eve if that first question didn't work he would have come another way and then another way and then another way you know this is the so she didn't mind what she needed to do as long as she got the sort the secret of samson's strength from samson amen now this is oh wait this is a um this is i think it's from the reunion island i just googled shark infested waters and you know i got this photo um but you see this is basically how it is the sea here is lies the island is truth i'm just making using this analogy so the devil doesn't care where you get off that's working he doesn't care what side of the truth you get off from as long as he gets you in here right so it doesn't matter if you come off this side of the beach with those people don't really care for you they don't love you you're this you know or off this side of the beach while the bible's been translated so many times you can't trust it he doesn't care what side you get off as long as you get him with these guys go swimming the water's fine the water might be fine as tropical but i don't want to get him with his sharks you know but see this is like lies as long as he gets you off the island of truth that's all he cares about just get in the boat you may get a while but you know it's going to get you're going to get chomped so i don't want to go stepping into lies why don't you stay where the truth is so but this is this this is the devil's you know he said the bible's filled with errors you know there's a whole movement in christianity that says the apostle paul is a liar the same spirit that's against brother brahms is the same spirit against the apostle paul they say the apostle paul was a pharisee and that's and you know the pharisees had hundreds of additional rules and things they added to the word of god and the apostle paul did the same thing and they even use the apostle paul's writings isolated statements against them to try and prove what they say but if you know in whom you have believed that thing doesn't shake you right you know the um you know uh before world war ii you know you know we know the lutheran church was very strong there in germany and the nazis were trying to break its influence upon the people and they brought up part of luther's writings that he was actually an anti-semite and they used a portion of that and the propaganda ministers just spread it everywhere say look this is what luther said because luther unified the german language you know he did culturally it was all luther was a massive impact on that country and so so they took a part of his writings and said look what he said but then the real believers knew what everything that luther said and they knew the heart of the man and they just just just basically discounted that part and they knew the nazis were using his writings to try and destroy the influence of christ in the nation why because that was just a father of lies manifesting itself amen because that why because they knew in whom they have believed other people be oh did that really say did he really say that he did but they knew his heart and they stood against it so we don't want to be caught up in isolated statements just like with the apostle paul or brother branham's oh no no if you know on whom you have believed which is the lord jesus christ those things will come against you so hold on now every every oh wait okay this slideshow is different to this slideshow we'll get there now here we'll we'll go this one every every lie has a lot of truth in it that's right now if it's a real lie just a just a right what we call a black lie or a little white lie the little white lie is the real lie you can see the big back big black lie but that's uh but it's that little white lie one that's got a hole like the one that the devil told eve see just one little thing off the cater that's what got our churches are listening to today they're saying oh you're right in your principle of baptism you're right in this you're right in that but he fails to let you know you've got to have love for that brother out there amen though he's right or wrong stand shoulders with him the kingdom of god and the presence of god amen so he's saying he's saying this part's right but he omits that part why because it still stands today by this shall all men know you're my my disciples because you have loved one for another that has not been scrubbed from the bible it cannot be scrubbed it is still true today amen it's an evidence that we are disciples of the lord jesus christ because we have genuine love one for another amen but you see now god sends warnings across our way because lies they can start from what we call little white lies but then it can go into full blown delusion he says o of the stories of these 31 years around the world and around and around hearing the confessions and things they would they'd raise the hair on your head to think of the things that hear them confess or what they've started how innocent they was so notice how they started how innocent they was and how beautiful uh sin looks and how attractive it looks to be but it's the way of death don't go in it whatever you do shun the very appearance of evil the liar he never he thought he'd tell a little lie to his mother he went to eat some coffee went in and blowed his breath in the mother's face see i never i never smoked mama but you lied a red light flashes don't do this little boy it's not easy to go to hell you have to fight your way to hell every time you do wrong this little red light drops down in you and the countdown comes little boy don't do this little girl don't do that see it's something happens in you but you fight right over it you pass by the church you hear the people singing the gospel songs you really want to go in but oh my you light up another cigarette shake your head what are you trying to do you're fighting your way right through every barricade i mean so it starts very innocent but it doesn't end innocent amen like people can can can can can twist and embellish the truth about a brother or sister and it can seem so innocent to begin with but then it starts to a full-blown war between them it can seem so innocent so appears can be right but actually no it's not now notice this i said that um iniquity was found in the heart of of of the devil right iniquity was found in the heart of satan now brother abraham in the natural he speaks about how how that spirit of cancer gets in and he says it begins when a cell gets like a bruise and then and then a life comes into that bruise he says that cell backslid he said he uses that he says that's a big word for a baptist to say but but uh but uh uh isn't it but you do it anyhow it was a it was backslid and the devil put a german there called a cancer a tumor whatever it to be and they begin to develop cells and he begins to suck on your blood and that's what he does he eats you he eats you up by pulling your blood so part of the body gets bruised by something and then and then the devil puts his life puts a demon life into that and then it begins to grow and feed off the very life i mean that's in a person and then he says here for instance i'll take to speak for a few moments about cancer it seems to be one of the major enemies today what is it what is a cancer where did it come from tumor cataract ulcer pneumonia tuberculosis all those names are medical names that medical science gave them the bible declares them to be devils for instance cancer what is cancer it usually comes from a bruise all natural things of the earth type the spiritual everything in the natural types are spiritual you know that most of you all i mean most all of you so you're saying in the natural now if someone if someone has a bruce cell then then the enemy can slip into that and cause a cancer to grow he says all night natural things type the spiritual so now you can be bruised in your spirit right you can be bruised by what people say or things happen in life hardship can come and disagreements and stress and trouble and it can actually cause a bruise in your spirit now that bruise now the devil can enter into that bruise in the spirit and begin to operate and so now what that can do is he what he wants to do is put his attributes in you and use your spirit to project himself just like the devil amen he he want to gather those angels to project his will through those angels right so the same thing when the when the devil sets up a stronghold in someone's spirit is because he wants to use that stronghold not only to suck the life out of them but to suck the life out of other people i mean so now now what happens with lies lies can actually manifest because of a bruise little child can feel very insecure they can come among a group of friends and they want to please that friend or please that group and they you know and then you know you know the group will ask them something and they're embarrassed and they begin to tell a lie to save face and they can just grow from that what is that a bruise can happen now but i want you to know from this you know i just want you to know from the get-go the word we are washed by the water of the word right the lord cleanses these things from us right that's why we gather that's why we read that's why we listen i mean for the word to wash us off these things so i want you to know there's not a natural someone without the lord there's a natural progression of life goes to death right but god interrupts that i mean he brings life i mean he brings truth he takes the air away and brings truth he brings healing and restoration so i don't want you to think well i started on this journey decades ago however when you're a little child and i'm stuck on this way you don't have to be stuck on this way i mean you can step off this this this hamster wheel the devil's got you on i mean and walk with the lord in truth but you see that's what happens is as people feel embarrassed and they feel you know uncomfortable and so so they embellish the truth or tell a bit of a lie to save face or try and try and make themselves look better than they actually are why because a bruise this is how it starts now he says look at the condition he was in now now this is abraham abraham's the father of faith amen we're the children of abraham we're the spiritual children of abraham hello children of abraham we're having a family reunion today how you doing praise the lord amen but you see abraham backslid because there was drought there was trouble in the promised land and so look at the condition he is in backslidden sure he was god took him sorry god told him to stay in palestine and he left palestine he was backslid he was sitting down there just telling a little white lie what did he tell them because his wife sarah was beautiful he said tell them that we are brother and sister now that was partially true because they were half brother and sister but you see a little error with the truth is a lie and little error with the truth brings forth death see the devil told the devil told partial truth it was partial light but it brought death so part of the truth actually doesn't bring the full it doesn't bring liberty it brings death right you shall know the truth not part of the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so a part of truth pardon me it just brings death ultimately it may help in a small measure but it doesn't actually bring its desired effect hey hello amen so so we don't want part of the truth we want all the truth because we want to be free indeed amen that's why jesus died on calvary that would be free indeed amen so so he was back suddenly he told us he told his wife you know they'll kill me to take you just say that we are brother and sister and that was partially true but it was a little white lie and then that lie had great consequences you know because because the king saw saw she was beautiful wanted to marry her you know the night before the wedding he gets on his pajamas he says his prayers and god says so you're as good as a dead man you're as good as a dead man he says what do you mean you know the integrity of my heart i've done anything wrong he said no you're going to marry that man's wife and you know you better restore his wife to her his wife to him otherwise you're as good as a dead man so that lie was going to have great consequences on his kingdom just a little white one help us lord jesus we don't want to just tell as i said there's not white lies and black lives it's all the same but abraham was just trying to save face and just try to you know keep his own skin intact but god can't back up a lie he can only back up truth he says sitting out there lying and a man that would say against a um against his wife to save his own neck are you worthy is that see what am i trying to do show you that it's god's grace that made you worthy amen you're no good i'm no good but he's the one that's good look to him he's the one that did it hasn't been hadn't been for god's grace abraham sat there lied was he lying did he do it he said that's my sister it's a little white lie they're big black ones amen now some of the biggest lies ever told are mostly truth as as i read that quote earlier eliza truth misrepresented so this is a a great devil's tactic right here what is the biggest lie that was ever told it's got 99 truth in it if someone said william branham on this certain date was up yonder and houston texas drunk as he could be that's a lie see oh say no he was in phoenix arizona who was preaching to the christian businessman he preached on a certain subject so many people was there they listened to till about 10 30 and then at 10 30 you know what he done reached down and took a drink of liquor and took it now there is a lie the rest of it was all true see it has to look just exactly like the truth to be deceiving and this is what critics do they make it look exactly like the truth to be deceiving we don't want to fall in that bracket we must tell the truth even if it's a detriment to our own self we must tell the truth we must be honest not just with believers but with everyone amen i trust when people see me or they see you they say those people are honest they are truthful they tell the truth amen we want to be tellers of truth amen see the devil wants to misconstrue the scripture that applies for today it's that misconstruing of that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know all that jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promise that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age that's all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all for you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it but that's what he does what did he do to eve he misconstrued the word for that day you know yay hath god said so that's all he needs to do now a classic one here and and i just took some very obvious ones is that people say that malachi 4 5 doesn't apply to the gentiles because malachi 1 1 says the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi now this is now if you think about that i know you've already read the following bit so you've already got my answer but you see people will take it and say oh malach the book of malachi is not even for us malachi 4 and 5 behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great beautiful day of the lord that's not for us then because they take that one verse but you know if that's true without reading the second part then the book of ephesians isn't to me the book of corinthians well i'm not from corinth who's from thessalonica who's from glacier anyone here who's from ephesus well i'll just begin to rip that out it's not for me no but the apostle paul says all scriptures is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for a proof for a correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so if a spirit ever comes to you and says no the book of malachi does not apply to the gentiles i'll say hold on all scripture is given by inspiration of god amen and it's profitable for doctrine so you can't just say oh the gospels are for teaching and this is for this and you're like splitting no no the whole word the whole word is profitable see the thing is people don't read their bible and they'll take one thing that seems so true because look it says the burden of the word lord israel well that's true but they're inferring no that it's not for us don't even read that book no all scripture is given for doctrine amen so i'd rather take what the apostle paul said than what somewhat some website says amen now do i have this one yes no jesus well let's just read this first mark 12 and 6. you know the pharisees followed jesus wherever he went to try and catch him in his words and that catching is like a snaring they want to try and catch what it says ah he said this or we can use it as a weapon and trap him that was there i feel sorry for people who who fall into that lot what's my job today follow the messiah the very prince of life the one who has healed the sick raise the dead cast out devils as the is the ransom for the whole world just follow and try and catch him in what he says now david says here in psalms 56 he says to the chief musician upon i'm not going to try and pronounce that word um of david those two words when the philistines took him and gath be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he's he fighting daily oppresseth me mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time i am afraid i will trust in thee and god i'll praise his word and god i'll put my trust i'll not fear what the flesh can do unto me every day they rest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul now that word rest is actually it's a carving it means in the strong's to carve so it says they take my words and they chop them and they carve them and make them say things i'd never said this is just like i said with martin luther they took things he said and use it against you know what they're carving his words just taking a part of what he said they didn't take his whole ministry right see now and it's exactly what they've done today they take a search program they omit and splice tapes amen to try and make the prophet say things he never said he says here and then the next measures that um uh uh that opened up the seven seals which undone all the hidden mysteries of the bible the doctrines and so forth which the world so rudely attacks nowadays attacks it and says it's wrong this that here the other day in arizona splicing tapes trying to make me say things that i didn't say you don't need to physically take the tape and cut it here and do this now you can just copy paste easy but they try and make him say things he never said amen but but what is it lies come from an agenda the devil had an agenda to destroy to cause adam and eve to fall i mean delilah had an agenda to make samson reveal his source of strength so it's the same thing lies come from an agenda now that agenda could be trying to save face trying to look better try and make yourself better than someone else trying to pull someone down that that by virtue you'll lift it up that's actually an agenda but it's a lie it comes from a fallen nature that needs to be dealt with amen now now here's another one if you want azusa street returned i just put this in the quote because i because i like this i want the power of god like never before amen not amen they had a genuine move of god and god doesn't take away he adds to so he took us in the street and then he added the opening of the word amen if you want azusa street return just lay down and be shaved all the way down with the word and find out yes sir that's the way back to azusa street experience is to be shaved off of those things and he's preaching the lamb and the dove i mean it's all malice strife and contention let it be shaved off all self rights and this is my right and i didn't no no let it be shaved off amen i know it's a privilege it belongs to you because you were born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies now this is actually two scriptures molded into one and critics will say well he's actually just mishmashing scripture let's just examine this i'm going to come down to our level but you know i say lies are a multi you know it's against an age it's against the ministry it's against different things right so people say well he's just misquoting the scripture now hold on let's go here psalms 51. i hope you can you can read that i can't read that back there he says now have mercy upon me oh god well i'll try and find it here because actually two things in here which are very important have mercy upon me o god according to my love and kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions now this is after he has been exposed by the prophet i think it was nathan that he had taken bathsheba right this is this is this psalm wash me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in my sight that thou uh might just be justified when thou speaketh and be clear without judges behold i was shaping iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now so so the reason people speak against brother brown putting these two scriptures together which we're going to read he's saying he he he is misquoting the bible therefore changing what it means but he's not changing what it means so behold i was shaping iniquity so i will shape iniquity comfortable speaking lies and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and the inward parts thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hossop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hath broken may rejoice now now the thing is people say well this is david's experience it doesn't apply to us but any really true repentant sinner will have the same heart and and feeling and expression and you know they'll feel exactly the same way david did right so so so the critic says well this this scripture doesn't apply to us it applies to david no well all scripture's given for inspiration and who's really been repentant and you come to a place you say god i'm just wicked i'm lost i'm filthy purge me yo i born iniquity i'm just lord change me so you can experience you're actually being in david's shoes right but then it says here make and and the reason i went down to verse eight that the bones which sell has broken may rejoice now people i've been asked the question years ago where brother brahm tells a story of the shepherd that has a sheep and the sheep just keeps wandering off and then so the shepherd breaks its leg you know and brings it back and they'd say what kind of a god would do that kind of a thing how you know it's not even that says not even scriptural well david because remember the reason he went after bathsheba is he backslid right another spirit came upon he actually backs in himself he looked at the you know palace window saw bathsheba and he committed adultery with her had his hus had her husband murdered all these things so he was actually straying from god and so god allowed that all to happen right why that the bonjour thou has broken may rejoice so so david's actually saying all this has befallen me their child died all those things actually he was actually equating it to like his bones had been broken right see if we're bible readers we can see what brother bram says we can find it in the scripture that's why i encourage you you listen to brother branham take it back into the scripture find where amen because he may not say specific chapter and verse but but it's just scripture he's preaching it's actually our job to do that eh don't just take my word for it take his word take my word and take it back into the bible and if you're not sure come ask me please i don't just want you to sit there saying uh and you don't even know what's going on remember it's you and god it's your walk with god right amen it's my walk with god so now we'll go down to psalms 58 did ye indeed speak righteousness so so wait just to keep it in your mind i oh wait sorry i'm changing the wrong thing shaped inequity come towards speaking lies so we've covered the first part of that which is from this psalm i shaved iniquity right and said did my mother conceive me now we go down to psalm 58 i trust is not too laborious he says do you indeed speak righteousness o congregation do we have that up there yes you do ye judge uprightly are ye sons of men yay in heart you work ye work wickedness you wave the violence uh of your hands in the earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the death adder that stoppeth her ear now some people say but eat some people say but the wicked come to the world speaking lies i want to ask the question do the righteous start off righteous by our first birth we're all wicked that's why we needed a savior that's why we needed god himself to become a man to purchase our salvation to change our nature so because if you take it the other way oh there's the righteous they are born righteous and the wicked they're born wicked that's just how it is you're actually diminishing the power of the blood right you're actually you're actually diminishing what he can do we are all born in sin no one has a free pass to heaven just like you know a catholic went to brother brown said you know about how everyone's shouting and screaming in the church and you know i won't go to that kind of place you know experience that kind of thing and he said well you know mary had to scream and shout and act like a drunk woman to get to heaven because she was in the upper room on the day of pentecost she was shouting screaming babbling stumbling around shouting and rejoicing he says you know you need if mary if mary who is what we call the mother of jesus who bear bore the messiah in her womb had to have that experience to get to heaven we need it too amen amen so now so we are all wicked by our first birth that's why we needed a savior amen what then for are they better than they speaking the jews and gentiles no no wise for we for we have before prove both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin as it is written there is none righteous no not one now once again i take what the apostle paul says i agree with him not my opinion i agree with him there is none that understand that there is none that seeketh after god they've all gone out of the way they're all together become unprofitable there's none that doeth good no not one so remember in god's eyes it's in or out saved or lost now we know there's different levels of salvation there's the bride there's a foolish virgin there's 144 000 there's all those kind of people but they all end up with eternal life so they're all so sorry i'm just using my terms they're either in or out right as is everyone here today yep so so what i mean in or out i don't mean you're the bride or you're lost no that's not how god works god's mercy is greater than our little minds can fathom right he is the fullest version of being looked after right 144 000 are being looked after there will be people who give cups of water in his name jesus said they'll know wise lose their reward amen so we can't discount those things just because we don't understand how it works but god said there'll be more people brother brahm said you'll be surprised who's there amen and and i just say that's wonderful hallelujah if i saw all of my work colleagues all my family all my friends everyone i knew at school everyone i ever knew in heaven i'd be happy about that wouldn't you be happy even your worst enemy absolutely i'd rather than there than not amen that's just how i feel like everyone come let's just empty the whole earth and just all gotten a rapture just leave the devil here get burned up you know but just take everyone amen into heaven that's how i feel amen so there their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues have they used to seek the poison of asps is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood now remember to shed blood these days it's just you murder someone's character it's not always a literal shedding of blood you can kill someone's influence by murdering their character i mean how do you do that by telling lies it can be a white lie but you push them down you're actually ultimately murdering their character i mean their destruction the destruction and misery are in their ways the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of god before their eyes now this is not just all that's unbelievers no no that can be message people right where the way of peace they have not known if you want to have if if you can't be happy unless you're fighting someone or have a fuss against someone you do not know the way of peace maybe we should want to be living peaceably with all men irrespective of it's our greatest enemy our bitterest rival whatever they are there should be such a love of god in your heart for them you don't want to start a fuss you don't want to continue or fast you know like the english and the french they fought the 100 year war let it go man they couldn't let it go i don't want to find a 100 year war amen just you know but that's how people want to be oh if it's not this brother is this sister not this sister this brother not this family is that family not this church is this church not this preacher that preacher they've got to fight someone fight the devil how do you do that you live a consecrated life and you love the lord with all your heart and you praise him and worship just tell him how good he is all day amen that's the thunder that shakes the devil i mean so we have an enemy sure we can disagree we're allowed to disagree you know what just like even the natural family you can disagree right about things i like sweet food not everyone likes sweet food i still eat savory because well i just eat anything but you know i prefer sweet food but just because you don't like sweet food doesn't mean we can't have be friends you say that's ridiculous well ultimately if there's a fuss going on between they're all ridiculous let's not you know let's be let's be men and women the world is coming to an end do you want your last moments on the earth to be remembered as a fuss and a fight no i want my last moment so i want to live for you lord jesus amen why do people lie now this is from this website yeah uh and and silvas.com you look at lies and you know it's amazing people say there's like four different colors of lies and no they're just all black or they're all i mean they're just all lies whatever color you want to put to it it's all that color but it's not good and bad or horrible whatever no no they're actually and god's eyes are all the same we may say them as see you in a in a in a variety or whatever was good and bad whatever spectrum but no no lies are lies so why do people lie they cover their tracks to create an illusion to distract from reality now i just want to say this i'm just going to take it this one way if you're hurting if you're really hurting don't just hold it in if you're in pain don't just hold it in if you're troubled don't just hold it in god wants to take it from you who wants to bring healing we don't we're not called to walk in these doors and put on a face and you know sometimes everything's not okay and it's actually okay when it's not okay because the lord can fix it but if we hold it and say no everything's fine though there will come a breaking point somewhere i would rather the breaking point be the devil is defeated as opposed to me breaking right so if you're hurting see god doesn't push us in the corner because we're hurting he what he's come to bind up the brokenhearted set at liberty them that are bruised so if you're bruised in your spirit and you're telling lies or trouble it because of a bruise he wants to set you free from that right we are not perfect people amen i'm not a perfect person i'm still a person i'm looking for a body change i'm going to rejoice and the more i spend on this earth the happier i'm going to be not because i'm aging necessarily but i just want to be free from myself i mean so you know if you're hurting if you're in pain there's healing for that there is in the in the blood of jesus christ there's a healing and we are not here to condemn anyone whatever you've been in or in right now you've tripped and fallen to something we don't push anyone down you don't have to sit in the back and do a probation nonsense no no just come to jesus so if you're so don't live under the lie that everything's fine when it's not okay right we don't have to remember a sheep is not a beast of burden it's not built to carry who's seen a sheep carrying a big pack on his back and being led by you don't see it because they're not physically built they're not a camel they're not a horse they're not an oxen they're not built that way they are not a beast of burden and we are not called to be because we're sheeping we're not called to be beasts of burden to carry pain and hurt and resentment and trouble and all that no we don't have to carry it well you could say actually the only place we're called to carrot is to the lord cast your cares upon him because he cares for you amen you know to make themselves look good or someone else look bad that's a lie you know to gain sympathy or or advantage you know it can be very hard when you talk to certain people and you don't know if they're telling you the truth or not because they twist things even just a little bit and they emphasize certain points and they make it look way bigger and it's hard are they really telling me the truth or do i have to kind of weave or maybe lean a certain way to bring it to the middle now that's very hard to do we're not called to be those kind of people we just tell the truth alter another person's perception of the situation to give false impressions to other people about themselves or someone else this person did this oh here they go again just offhand comments to try and rubbish people down those are lies we're here to build one another up i want to see everyone in heaven i want to see you all there and if everyone at church on youtube land i want to see you all there right there's not a single person and now this is from my heart there's not a single person i know have known that i don't want to see in heaven i want to see everyone there and that's how we should be so we don't want to tell what we call white lies to gain advantage or to get sympathy sure if we're hurting we're hurting going through a rough patch we'll go through rough patches but the body's here to help one another amen and the lord is here to bring the strength hallelujah amen but these are all people will lie for their cause like i said the nazis lied for their cause well that's very obvious people want to destroy the message they tell lies for their cause right see because remember the tactic of the enemy is to try and put enough doubt on upon the word of god to make you disbelieve it just like i said about the apostle paul this whole movement they want to try and destroy his ministry the bible has been translated so many times how can you prove it if god is his word he will keep it pure amen amen so we don't want to we don't want to but bc the reason people lie is because that iniquity that was in the devil in heaven has come down into them by their first birth or by a bruise lord jesus just cleanse us out now i don't want i have no part in him and i want no part of him and me amen proverbs 26 we're gonna wind up soon he says now where no wooders they're the fire garth out so where there is no tail bearer the strife sees us as coals are to as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a contentious man that kindles strife the words of a tail bearer are as wounds they go down into the innermost part of the belly now that word talbera means it so so to roll to pieces a slanderer a tail bearer a whisperer so when that spirit is not there's no more strife right i say if you if all your relationships are trouble then maybe there's a common denominator in that situation that's you if you have peace with everyone there's a common denominator that's you and the reason you're one or the others because of the grace of god's come into your life amen and taking those things out now you can start see a tale bearer can seem so innocent but it says wounds have gone to the innermost part of the belly now on the other end of the spectrum this is a human spectrum there are people who come under a strong delusion and so with all this evilness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not a love for the truth i pray that we have a love for the truth amen we love this amen we love his word amen we have a love for it not just receiving the truth but a love for the truth if you don't have a love for the truth you say lord jesus i want to love your word may i receive a love for the truth that they might be saved and for this course god shall send them a strong delusion what's the cause they don't receive a love for the truth i mean they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness amen so we i pray none of us have pleasure in seeing people being torn down so that to me so a strong delusion what's that that's a very strong cause in their own mind and they'll do all that they can that that strong delusion is projected lord jesus help us but we understand this that see it says yey and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution but no evil but but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived just like the devil he was deceived by his own iniquity and then he started deceiving and he's still deceived today see that same attribute is coming to man but we are called not to have that in us amen that's why the lord jesus came to cleanse us of all unrighteousness amen that we would be free see the effects of lies are very powerful brother branham would um you could actually see it in the film 20th century prophet there's a woman that comes up to him in the prayer line that's the you know there's the 10 minutes where he's interviewed by the brothers there and then there's a chicago campaign a video 10 minutes as well and there's a woman comes up before him and and and as a prayer line and this is what goes on and you can see the expression on her face she starts breaking down and crying so this liar's had a great impact on her life excuse me sister have to relax my mind once in a while because he just spoken to someone else now we be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're away from here you come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart and you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that was a man that was professing divine healing the sister says yes sir and you can see it in the film and you can hear it he said you was a witch yes is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something about it isn't that right and your pastor's sick right now he's got polio is that right yes sir sister don't pay no attention to what their people tell you they're lying the only thing that's wrong with your heart is a nervous condition got your heart worked up go home in peace and god bless you you're all right god bless you you're not a witch i mean to that lie that was told on who made her get heart trouble get troubled and stir and then a whole church was stirred up why because a minister said oh she's a witch and now everyone else was believing that lie it caused trouble in the church i mean but it was just a lie that was told upon her from someone in authority and it made her have this trouble and things because just a lie was told because the devil told her through that preacher that she was a witch but she is a genuine sincere believer and that's why it troubled her this in my opinion it troubled her so much because i believe we're all sincere people we want to be right with god amen that's why we've given our lives to him that's why i want to serve him because we love him and we want to please him and because he's so wonderful he you know and so so if someone would come against you and say no you're a witch look at you you do this and you're wrong here and because of your sincerity you get all troubled about it and see this lie had such an impact on her life it was physically manifesting in her body amen but the spirit of truth came and told her no no that's just a lie that's been told upon you but see she was believing that lie up until that point and it was troubling her whole life and there's a thing with a lie if it can influences in that way it can trouble our whole life that's why i pray lord jesus may your spirit the spirit of truth come amen and expose all lies all things that hold over us amen that we can walk free hallelujah amen see you're not a witch see you're all right god bless you you're not a witch she walked out there happy and rejoicing amen but you see the devil tries to live us up make us live under a lie amen you'll never be free you'll never really receive the holy ghost this is not for you you'll never be healed you just have to put up with this problem you just got to live with this this is just how you've got to live from now on see he wants to want you to live under a lie you're not really going to go to heaven the rapture is really not for you you're never going to make it you're not good enough you're never going to achieve you know all those things he tries to make us live and your family is not going to be saved your loved ones are never coming in this is never going to happen and see if see if that can if that can influence us it can make us actually physically start to be stressed we can get heart conditions out of fear and worry why because a lie has come into our lives but we need to look into the spirit of truth and say lord what have you said in your word because your word is ye and amen your word is true it's not a lie it's not something just to pump you up it's reality this power in his word amen to manifest hallelujah just like he says ye and your family shall be saved believe on the lord jesus christ you and your family shall be saved that's a promise to us that's not just a promise to the philippian jailer that's a promise to me and if he says that i wish all that you would prosper in health amen i believe that i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases i believe that amen if he's come to bind up the brokenhearted let's go to luke chapter four i'm going to read i'm going to read what the spirit of truth said amen i'm so glad we can go to where truth is truth is proven truth has a foundation truth is the same in every generation truth backs itself up truth isn't empty truth isn't some half-baked promise amen truth means what it says hallelujah amen i believe it's luke chapter yeah four here and we're going to go to verse 17. amen and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaias amen sorry i'm just trying yep and when he had opened the book uh he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sights of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to sound to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now that is the spirit of truth and that same spirit is in the bride today that same spirit of truth is in this church that same spirit should be in you and i if you have the holy ghost that same spirit is in you and what has he come to do i mean to heal the brokenhearted that's why if you're brokenhearted you don't have to stay broken-hearted you can go to the lord and the lord can heal your broken heart well how does he do it i don't know if you have any kind of complex surgery you have to have brain surgery do you need to understand what the doctor does to trust the surgery do you need to know all the minor details he may say we'll cut here and do this here but do you need to know the ma the details no you just trust the surgeon that he's going to do the surgery you have a need i need the surgery go to the surgeon he does the surgery and you come out well right it's the same thing with the lord how is he going to heal me i don't know but i put my life in his hands i mean he's a great physician he can take the spiritual tumor out this pain that's hurt these lies his iniquity whatever it is he can take it out of him why because he's come to heal the brokenhearted hallelujah this is the spirit of truth i believe this with all my heart that the lord is here if you have pain in your life you don't need to carry it even if you are broken hearted disappointed you don't need to stay that way amen amen to preach deliverance to the captives see that woman was a captive to a lie but the spirit of truth loosed her from that life hallelujah and the spirit of truth can loose you amen from any lie or complex of the enemy hallelujah and recovering of the sight to the blind you know some people our eyes can just get glazed over a bit like john the baptist that received the holy ghost in his mother's womb amen his eyes got glazed over his eagle vision got glazed over brother braham said when he's in prison that's why he sent his disciples to jesus are you is it you or do we look for another see he because of because he didn't expect his life to end up there amen his vision he you could say he got blinded but then the spirit of truth came and go tell john what you see i mean the sick are healed the dead are raised the gospels preached to the poor all those things and then john's vision recovered there there in prison because he realized the one i introduced to to israel that is actually the messiah hallelujah i mean so we can be a bit blinded by things that happen to us but the lord is here to restore our vision amen to sit at liberty them that are bruised amen you're bruised today you don't have to stay bruised you have to be bound by those things you can be loosed amen to preach the acceptable year of the lord now we know that that same anointing has been done through seven church ages right that's the holy ghost in this he's here today hallelujah amen let's just finish with with john chapter 8 and 31 we're going to finish here then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham's seed and whenever in bondage to any man how sayeth thou ye shall be made free jesus saith unto them verily will i send you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever pardon me but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed hallelujah and those who said if ye shall know the truth see people of people have asked you know how can you know the truth in this day well the lord said you shall know the truth if you seek me with all my heart you shall find me you shall know the truth if you continue in my word then you are my disciples you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's a force in the truth to free anyone who's bound amen and if the son therefore set you free you shall be free indeed amen not just partially free you'll be free indeed hallelujah amen praise god i'm so glad i'm so glad sure there's lies the devil's a father of lies we don't but the believer has no part in that we may be born you know with that attributedness of of being a liar right but there comes a time in our christian walk where god kills it amen where where the holy ghost can actually you you begin to say a lie he said no hold on sorry that was wrong i didn't mean to say that and you put things right see the holy ghost should actually tell you the lord himself shall tell you no no you shouldn't do that you shouldn't have done that make that right amen and you go yes sorry and you make it right that's how it should be because we have no part in the devil and devil has no part in us but if you find yourself in that way the blood is here to take that lying spirit away take that bruise away amen because what i love about the new birth is god can just he just takes it all out everything that's of the devil he just takes it out hallelujah amen and and as you keep walking with the lord maybe you find something comes up again or buried there you know it begins to grow the lord allows things you know what you know weeds you can't pluck out weeds if there's still seeds in the soil who's tried to do that i haven't tried to do that i don't think any gardener does that but it's when it's when the weeds come out then they're pulled out it's the same thing with us we have things buried in our spirit and our nature but when the sunlight begins to fall the holy ghost amen the water of the word washes it doesn't just bring you know bring the wheat out it brings weeds out but the reason and us that happens is because the lord wants it plucked out so when you see you may tell a bear face lie you may be shocked to say oh god i can't believe i did that what's that it's a weed come out and the reason that it actually comes out is god knows it's in you but he wants it out of you and the only reason the only way it can come out is when you say lord take this from me and he takes it from you he doesn't pin you down and pull everything out of you no no it's out of a willing heart we say lord take it all from me amen we have the musicians please this morning i'm so glad amen the spirit of truth is present in his word to set us free amen i'm glad he heals a broken hearted hallelujah it's just a cavity that sits at liberty them that are bruised praise the lord amen we have a um i just want to sing um we are we sang it this morning but i want to sing that song this power in the blood would you be free from your passion and pride i mean so if you find yourself embellishing things to people you know yes actually that's a lie you got to stop that you know twisting things that it plays in your advantage more you play a political game in your mind no just tell the truth don't don't twist things twisting things is a lie that's the truth misrepresented say lord take it from me may i be truthful with everyone may i be truthful with myself i remember this power in the blood this
