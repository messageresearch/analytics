so I don't have I didn't save my PowerPoint I made it but I didn't save it so I'm sorry about that let's go to Ruth the Book of Ruth and Ruth chapter one in verses we're going to read verses 6 to 17 so Joshua judges Ruth alright so I mean say I mean when you're there Andy brother head he's already there praise the Lord I mean sis read so Ruth chapter 1 and I will read from verse 6 it says here then she arose with her daughters-in-law this is Naomi returning with with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard him and the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah and noemy said unto her two daughters of Lord go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and noemy said turn

agree with me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and all for kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods returned thou also returned out after thy sister-in-law Andrew said and treat me not to leave thee nor return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou Dyess will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she less speaking unto her a minute let's go to second Corinthians chapter five we're gonna read verses 1 1 to 7 there synchronous five and this is wonders even if I'm there I'm in alright for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for unless we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for what we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit wherefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord before we walk by faith not by sight Amen licious behaves in a word of Prayer gracious father we so glad we walk by faith and not by sight and Lord just asking as we have read from the Lord from your holy word I just pray father you would anoint your word to every soul father I just pray Lord that you just take total control over the service Lord may you Father have preeminence in every life and Lord may may the whispers and the doubts the enemy be cast to one side and may you just have total dominion Lord us pray you an anoint speaker and hear one more time Lord we are Lord without you we can do nothing but Lord with you we can do all things we thank you lord it's by your grace and we just pray father you be at those who could not be here today Lord be their portion Lord wherever they are father's want to commit ourselves into your hands meet every need here as well Lord father speak to every heart Lord in every life may you grant it for your glory please in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you or you may have your seats this morning I also like to thank brother Isaac for preaching on Sunday while I was up and Taronga and I just like to you know I heard the service and I want to say I'm so glad I have no place at that table hallelujah I'm glad I only have a place at the table of the Lord and I'd like to thank brother Andy for Wednesday night let's walk on the water hallelujah let's it's let's step out amen let's step out and walk on the water now I do speak on this morning about the power of the power of decision now this may seem a bit elementary but I couldn't I couldn't shake it off today but I want to go into more this just making a mental choice now the definition of a decision is an active process of deciding the moment of decision has come a determination that has arrived after consideration it's a report or a conclusion now that's the definition now every every decision has consequences the decisions we make even today will shape our future they shape who we are in the end shape where we will end up they're the decisions sometimes we think our decisions don't don't carry a lot of weight but they are but they do what we do today as a result of a decision we made years ago so who you are today is you made a choice maybe a few years ago and that decision has has directed you are certain a certain path right you know it it puts you on a certain trajectory of life your decisions like your decisions like a bow I mean and you're the arrow and your decision will fire you to a certain location so it depends on what your decision is right now you know when I was when I was 14 years old now I'm I guess I'm a nerd well I do science as a job so I'm a bit of a nerd but when I was 14 I saw a diagram of an atom on a blackboard in science class and I thought to myself that that was quite interesting that sent me on a course that I had now work in the science field but it was a decision it was a small thing but a decision directed my path down a certain way now that's just natural things now people are remembered for the decisions that they make people are remembered for their decisions such decisions become defining moments where and that is what people are remembered for even though they may do many things in life and many other things certain decisions that they make will stand out and will become landmarks in history as you you think of you know Abraham Lincoln you know brother Brown speaks of Abraham Lincoln very highly and he and he said that he is reading where Abraham Lincoln he he he got off a boat down in New Orleans this is this is before the Civil War before he became president and it's during the days of slavery and he's seen them taking great big burly colored man his little wife two little kitty screaming crying praying and they auctioning him off they had to breed him with some big a woman to bring forth a bigger bunch of healthier slaves and the little mother standing there and old Abraham Lincoln took off his hat from his head headed and his first he said that's wrong that man's a human just the same as I'm a human and some day I'll hit that thing with all I've got even if it costs my life he made a decision that that was wrong something something resonated an assault that that was wrong and he was going to fix this thing and it's normally what happens when when decisions are made it brings forth a character out of you right it really produced it or really reveals what's in you when you make a decision if Abraham Lincoln did not have the character he had he would have moved on like any other one who can done slavery but something in him rose up saying I'm gonna deal with this thing hallelujah and he did and it cost him his life hallelujah Amen this normally with great decisions great prices must be paid I mean we know the greatest decision God made before the foundation of the world with a lamb was land hallelujah for you and I he made a great decision how Redemption would come and he knew wouldn't be by someone else he had to become a man into it he had to fulfill the job great decisions were made I mean great prices were paid in great victories were won because of that decision I mean when our Lord was there on the Garden of Gethsemane and said not my will but thy will be done when to Calvary is a man hallelujah he made a great decision I mean but he wasn't looking at us at his present circumstance real decisions are made by faith when the word is revealed to a people that's when real decisions can be made wrong decisions are made by temporal looking at temporal things real decisions are made by with the eyes of faith looking at the promise of God hallelujah I want to be in that kind of category of people where I make every decision based on the Word of God by man's influence or pressure or culture or whatever but solely on the Word of God hallelujah that's the kind of people that we're built to be i mean you will discover as you walk with god there's a character and you didn't even know you had I mean there's a determination there's a grit hallelujah I mean you you'll you'll realize that you'll go through the trial you won't stay in the trial you go through it I mean because he'll lead you through it hallelujah I mean it's Abraham Lincoln made a decision that was wrong brother Graham said that Abraham Lincoln we're told that you know he never owned a book in his life until he was a till he was of age and the only books that he had was the was the Bible and pilgrims progress and that molded his character to make him the man he was I mean so so so the things that he that you look upon will mold your character the things you feed upon will mold your character if you feed upon the things of the world entertainment whatever more I mean that will mold you a certain way but if you if you're fixed on the Word of God and you allow that to mold your character that will produce the Word of God in your life amen and it will make you a certain way and you'll make the right decisions hallelujah John Wesley's mother Susanna Wesley incredible woman she had 17 children this is in the days of we didn't have the modern conveniences of this kind of your modern era but she found - you were told she she found two hours or more a day every day to pray she had 17 children often her file your husband would be off doing different things but she she she had she made a decision that she was going to raise her children for the Lord and she out of out of her 17 children two of the greatest men of the age were birthed John Wesley we know he you know he was the messenger to the age and he saved the world in a revival I mean with the second work of grace sanctification hallelujah and then also produced Charles Wesley the greatest songwriters that have struck the earth she made a decision decisions are not always easy to keep there's always a lot of adversity yo the devil doesn't want us to go have an easy way right to to walk with God you've got to make up your mind and sell out and you've burned every Bridge and that's it I'm walking with him come what may come what what yeah it doesn't matter what happens I'm walking through Lord Jesus I'm walking through you've got to have that kind of euro settle it in your soul hallelujah amen so so so she she made a decision she was going to raise her children I mean I know it that way and out of her out of her motherhood produced John and Charles Wesley she didn't have it easy all the time but that was her she made up her mind this is the way I'm going and on this is the way I'm going amen Winston Churchill he knows Winston Churchill Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War two they'd come to a great crisis time Western Churchill he you know we remember him for World War two but he he had a lot of failures in his life that are not recorded you know not you know there aren't the things we normally remember him for he is the one who planned the glibly campaign it was a great failure you know we know in this country that you know ll national identities founded there on the beaches there of Turkey you know where the campaign failed of the Anzac troops he actually devised that campaign he had a lot of other failures in his life but when it came to his defining moment in life I'll go back to Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln he didn't have a lot of success in his life he was you know he he went for public office quite a few times and and he didn't win he had a lot of hardship but we remember him for the Civil War white really remember him for the Gettysburg Address because his character was mold all the way down for that defining moment of time sometimes we may be just used for a short space John the Baptist was molded for 30 years for six months ministry that was his defining moment he made a decision I don't know how it came the spirit Lord hate you you know we're told the scripture says he received the Holy Ghost at his mother's womb when he was a small child the spirit drove him out into the desert to prepare him I mean for six months sometimes God will just users for a short space of time but there were years of molding and character development hallelujah that will make the right decision at the right time hallelujah was the Churchill you know you know there's the you know Great Britain its epitomized in a bulldog you know grit determination they hold on they don't let go that's the that's the character of great burden and this was epitomized in Winston Churchill he was determined we need when the you know when the Nazis just blitzkrieg their way through through France and and different countries they basically controlled them take them too long and they conquered Europe and then England was virtually just standing alone he rose up he did not say let's give him he did not say let's make peace with Hitler like his predecessors tried to do but he would go to a school in 1941 he spoke at harrods school I mean he rose school in October the 29th 1941 and this was the main part of his address to to to the school children never given never given never never never and nothing great or small large or petty never given except to convictions of Honor and good sense never yield to force never yield to apparently overwhelming might of the enemy here they were facing the might of Nazi Germany and this was how he was well never surrender we'll fight them on the beaches and the hedgerows we will never given we will never surrender and it rallied a whole nation hallelujah and really the whole nation this was how he was because he made a decision we're going to fight we're going to rise up and fight hallelujah now if that's just a natural war how much the bride of Jesus Christ do we not have a cause I mean do we not have a water fight a victory to win the rapture to take hallelujah but you've got to make a decision whose side are you going to join I mean because the devil will treats us God has no fear I'm sitting on the fence will the devil built that fence get off the fence you not some whining cat moaning to the moonlight get off it a mental s never given our decisions shaped by various things our backgrounds as we've spoken about Winston Churchill Abraham Lincoln our environment our culture our family tree our nature we're born with shapes our decisions amen but we must remember that even though so God because many times you think well I'm making a decision and it's totally neutral it's me you know you know I'm the boss of you know what I'm deciding that's actually not the case as brother Isaac I think sit on Sunday we are but dumb sheep doesn't matter if you're doesn't matter what pedicure and you still a sheep amen it doesn't matter if you you can be the head RAM of the flock you're still the Sheep holy amen so you know it's more than just our our top two inches here that makes a decision right but the decisions we make a result of an influence now when when we speak about so we must remember that even though God God has put us here on free moral agency we have the power to choose nature doesn't have a power to choose they just are governed by instinct but we have a power to choose and God put us there on that way but when we think about having free choice that has a bias in it our choices are directed by our nature so our free moral choice is directed by the nature in us it governs our choice right so we are just here a total I'm neutral I'll make any choice now your nature will guide you a certain way whether we like it or not and it's because now so and this is why man always makes the wrong choice this world is going to blow itself up because man made a wrong choice and man has continued to make a wrong choice men are born now we are born with a fallen nature that's why we've got to be born again right that's why a new birth has got to happen you've got to be not just turn over a new leaf and reform at all you know our new users coming alternate a new leaf it'll blow back right it'll blow back you'll go back into the same rut unless God comes and changes your nature you'll continue to do the same thing you've always done I mean that's why we cannot save ourselves or redeem ourselves you need a stronger power than you I mean to come into your life and change you that's why that's what has to happen amen so now it takes we are born with a fallen nature and it will always end up making the wrong decision amen our nature and us will guide us so it will panda that's why men will always pant it to the flesh they'll always be selfish ultimately they'll always look after their best interest they will look after number one that's themselves by the way right just they will do you know the you know the world says just do what makes you happy amen yo just live for the moment and that's why this marriage is falling apart family life is falling apart is because this world pandas to our first birth I mean they say just say just live for the now live for the moment I'm living for a moment right that moment is where my body has changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the moment I'm living for right that's the moment many people know and and so I trust you're living for the same moment now many people repent of things and ask for forgiveness only because they get caught right that's not real repentance that's just being busted right many people repent because they get caught that's not real repentance right that's just because they get busted you've got to do the more than just ask for forgiveness you've got to pray until you die to that desire and that God changes your nature until that desire is dead that's what has to be the way that's how you can make the right decision as the desire that take you down that road amen dies hallelujah and there is a real death nothing about natural death you've got to die to yourself that you're there your nature changes I mean God gives us a nature change hallelujah that's why we're a new creation we're not a patched up pression we are a new creation we do that the believer really does get born again it's not a catchphrase then that's all grace and they live in a big gray area that always panders to the flesh and they say well God will forgive me and they're still living the same way that's not it that's not it that's when God comes in changes your nature that the desire you had to live in the world is dead and you have no desire to do it anymore and all you want to do is live for God I know what it's like I wouldn't even have been here a few years ago you wouldn't catch me in a place like this you and catch me living the life I I'm living now I mean back you know just over 10 years ago but something happened to me and it was Jesus Christ happened to me hallelujah so now we don't want to live a life where our decisions are based on our first birth we want to live a life where our decisions are based on God's life in us according to his word right brother Bram says in the breach between the seven churches and seven seals he says now he was given a free moral agency speaking of Adam it was given to him just as we as to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them that same tree sits before each and every one of us God isn't doing for Adam and Eve you say well it's their fault no it's not their fault anymore it's your fault you can't place it on Adam now you replace it on yourself because right and wrong is hit before you you're on the same basis of Adam and Eve but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his choice right that's how you know that you are redeemed you know you no longer want your own will what you want I mean you want his will what he wants and his will and what he wants is his word hallelujah ain't you glad to be redeemed I mean when you came to a place where you four footed your own will over to him and he took control hallelujah amen now Adam and Eve one of their own choice they wanted to they wanted to find out what it's like to have wisdom so they probed into it and of course death Allu you know and that's why we're in this position we're in today now let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 1 you say well how can you know how could it be that God changes your nature he has to change our nature season Hebrews 10 otherwise we're just living under the blood of bulls and goats but we don't offer them anymore right this there's greater power in the blood of Jesus Christ amen to transform any life depends on your decision though amen who are you choosing you know because many people they say they want to be like Jesus the only way can be like Jesus if Jesus is in you right you can't be Jesus okay you can't be like him and your own ability for the law having a shadow or we in Hebrews 10 and 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the ear very image of things can never with those sacrifices the blood of bulls and goats which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they have not ceased to be offered because the that the worshiper once purged should have no more conscious of sins so if you're purged you have no more conscious of it right but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins now let's drop down to verse 12 but this man he's speaking about Lord Jesus after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from hits forth expecting til his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified we're of the Holy Ghost also as a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant I'll make with him in those days saith the Lord I'll put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them hallelujah see sag now that the that the blood of bulls and goats can't purge a person it just covers up soon but the blood of Jesus Christ purges us off sin hallelujah that we have no more consciousness of sin hallelujah I'm glad he purges us I'm glad he cleanses us I mean both faith and his word he cleanses and purges us amen now our decisions as I've said will be made ultimately because of our nature and our nature as I said is governed nature is actually governed by two powers only to Satan's influence which will produce sin which is ultimately unbelief in the Word of God right you boil down sin that's not not a dull tree you know lying drinking smoking murder rape whatever it may be those are attributes of sin but the real sin is unbelief right so Satan's influence will ultimately cause unbelief in God's Word or God's influence will produce faith in the word right it's it's those two influences on our nature now those two are the two most important I'd say in terms of this is what we're going by so so I've settled that because we have to realize we're not just wandering through the world master of our own you know own destiny you know we make the choice it's the goodness of God that lead us to repentance it's his goodness no man can come to the Father but by me right all that the father has given me will come and all that come to me I'll no wise cast out so if you make it a session Lord I come to you he won't cast you out he won't say no you not welcome he'll say come in hallelujah and we should have the same kind of heart where it says in the end of the book of Revelation the Spirit of the bride say come who's ever thirst come and that's why we shouldn't be like with the protocole son and you know the other son is not happy that the protocol has returned we should be rejoicing I mean we should have our joy bells off and when we see someone come to the Lord that should be our heart come it's worth it it's a great decision you'll receive eternal life you receive walking with God in this world freedom of sin and every freedom of this flesh everything Alleluia you will it'll be worth it it is worth it now God so Satan made a decision in the beginning but before that God made his own decision hallelujah then we'll come down to us again season revelations 13 and 8 that we quoted before and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him which is the Beast whose name was not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so before there was anything the lamb was slain in God's mind he had already made away glory I mean hidden he had made away for the names in the book and I trust you can say I'm written in that book of life that's why I've received him in the South because my name is written there hallelujah amen so now but then Satan also made his own decision he Lucifer was once the anointed cherub that covereth he was the worship leader in heaven right he was he was you could say God's right-hand man sees in Ezekiel 28 from verse 11 where over the word Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto Him thus saith the Lord now this lamentation upon the king of Tyrus is actually speaking of the anointing upon the king right thus saith the Lord God seal us up the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been and eat in the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the the saddest the topes and the diamond the barrel the ox and the jasper the sapphire emerald and the carbuncle the gold the workmanship of our tablets and of our pipes was prepared in thee in the day thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth I have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of God but me thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfectly in my ways from the day they was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise as they have filled the midst of thee with violence thou has sinned therefore all Cassy as profane out of the mountain of God and I'll destroy the Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty that was corrupted thy wisdom by reason of their brightness I will cast to the ground old lady before kings that they may behold thee thou has two Father thy sanctuaries by the multitude of their iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I will bring for the fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be at Kirra and never shall there be anymore so God is saying that this this this this devil we fight he was once the anointed cherub that covereth but he made a decision one day based on his appearance based on what God had made him and he thought he's a bit more bitter than anyone else in heaven and then he came to a conclusion I can do this better I can make a better Kingdom right I could have a better worship and it season I'm Isaiah 14 that this one says I'll be like the Most High so I'll be God this is what he was he made a decision he made the wrong decision right God knew it would happen God wasn't surprised when there was a civil war in heaven and he was cast out he wasn't surprised he knew was going to happen but he made the wrong decision and we are under the result of that decision today this world is right God but when God makes a decision but God also made a decision and God's decision is his word right and God doesn't change his decision when God speaks forth his word he doesn't change it later he doesn't he he doesn't add you know sub-clauses and clauses and amendments to his word he just puts his word forth amen and he doesn't change it God doesn't hit yo God's thoughts you know he doesn't change his thinking like we do you know we can look at something make a decision come back later maybe we've learned some more and then we look at it again and we change our mind God doesn't change his mind I mean God is God's mind you could say is set in stone and and it it's his word I mean you see now anytime that God has ever called on the scene to make a decision when he makes a decision it has to be forever be his same decision now remember he cannot change his mind because he's perfect you believe God's perfect you believe he's infinite certainly he's infinite well if he's infant at the end he can't learn anymore now we are finite we just keep on learning and take this back and add something more and take away but God can't see he's perfect every decision is perfect so we must always remember keep your mine's and Heights on his word right amen he says now if God ever makes a decision ever called to make a decision in God's decision he being infinite he has to continually stay with that decision right so what he declares in his word he cannot change right and on the day of Pentecost the prescription was given to heal the world of sin and dr. Simon Peter stood up with his neurology degree hallelujah and and they asked him good doctor what shall we do that we can be saved we see that we've got the sin disease that we're actually born with how can we be cured and the good doctor picked up the script and he said repent to me baptize every one of you for the remission of sin and the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then they are and then he said I'll tell you how good the prescription is it's for you for your children for those that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call so people can be very a far off you can be a far off even sitting here your mind can be a million miles away it's good for you too hallelujah and God doesn't change his method if he saves man one yo-yo if he saves man by faith by the blood of Jesus Christ gives them the Holy Ghost by coming guys provided way he'll do it for the second man he'll do it for the third person he'll do it for everyone who will believe amen and so the problem is a lot of people are handing out there's a lot of quack doctors out there handing out the wrong script there's only one script that's the gods provided way God doesn't change his mind about his word right God doesn't change his mind amen that's why we want to make our decisions based on his word hallelujah it means that God doesn't change his word for culture doesn't change his word because men yo you know the world becomes modern society changes God doesn't change his word it has stayed the same and it will produce the same results I mean that's why we've got to have a real Bible faith that's what this Misha's has seen to do is turn our hearts back to the faith of the Apostles that we have a Bible faith I'm in a Bible doctrine I'm in a Bible Holy Ghost I'm in a Bible read am sure hallelujah a Bible salvation that's what we have hallelujah I mean it worked for me I trust this work for you hallelujah when you read the book of Acts you see how God worked there you say hallelujah I know the same God Amy does the same thing hallelujah now the Bible is made the Bible is a record of decisions the Bible is a record of decisions we we yeah I just spoke of to God's decision Satan's decision that was before there was a world and now it's come down into time Adam and Eve made their decision God knew they'd make that decision Cain and Abel had to make a decision Cain's decision was what was made upon what he mentally knew he brought he brought you're the fruit of the fields Abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain because it was revealed to him it was blood right he with me so he made the right decision and in Cain rejected God's counsel killed his brother based on a decision and that decision was based on his nature he following me right and it's all the way down through the Bible decisions have been made you may say well that's very obvious but you got to look now people made their flesh and blood like you and I Noah made a decision one day God spoke to him what is he gonna do about it right he had to respond to the call he had to respond to the vision he saw he had to put he had to put hands and feet to his faith right he couldn't just say well God's going to destroy the world and well the Arkell if God really wants us safe then he's going to build it though he had to build it he had to actually not just talk about it's very easy to talk about God right but when you actually put your hands upon the word and actually take the promise for yourself that's when criticism comes up I mean that's when the persecution rises when you put your hands on the word for yourself that's when the trouble happens they meant you're maybe before he even built the ark now this is just me he he'd begin to talk to people this world is getting wicked amen brother Noah I believe it sure is look at this have you seen the stats and all the things that's getting worse and gods gods a God of judgment amen brother Noah I believe it God told me to build an ark he starts building it then the a means God but quieter the questions start rising hey what do you mean you're the only one who's got the way of escape what do you mean that this is going to happen God's a good god he wears this rain you speak of right and in the and in the a means turn into questions fit into persecution all these things but Noah made a decision that God had showed him the way of escape and he was going to stick until they dock was built and he was going to stick with it till ever um that was going to be saved was in there right he was he made a decision I'm following this vision right he didn't have a he didn't have a favorite preacher to scream at him every whenever he downloaded me to never leave one hundred sermons he didn't have a Bible to read like we do he had a vision from God and and his decision was I'm following this decision doesn't matter who follows doesn't matter who agrees disagrees whatever more I'm following this decision amen Moses made a decision one day he was he was going to be the next king of Oh next Pharaoh he could have been the next Pharaoh but God moved in his heart his mother wrote raised him up in pharaoh's palace and I believe she would have poured into him Moses your father and I have been praying before you're born we prayed we called upon God because we saw the promise was drawing nigh that we'd go to the promised land and someone would have to become a deliverer and we prayed Lord bring him fulfill your word hallelujah and then we by faith saw you a proper child something moved in us know the Egyptians aren't going to kill you they're not going to throw you in the Nile that you'll be crocodile food and then we hit you we're to burden we put you in the sack we felt moved hey they didn't have us they just felt you gotta be moved by inspiration yeah but you'll see it's in the scripture I mean there's a you know your inspirations right you see it in the word hallelujah and then they put him in the Ark sit him down on the crocodile fish the Nile God guided him down there to Pharaoh's Palace and and then his sisters following and then you know a Pharaoh's daughter picks him up we need a nurse she comes out of the bushes I know what how convenient hallelujah don't tell me God don't know how to orchestrate things hallelujah and then and then now here's now this Prince of Egypt he's like a terrorist he's like a sleeper cell hallelujah sitting in Spiros palace and his mother's pouring into him you gonna do it you love me you gonna be the one hallelujah you see your brethren out there you're not gonna stay slaves you're the one God's gonna come I don't know how he's going to do it but he promised he's going to do it hallelujah and Farrah and then Moses had to make a decision am I gonna stay here or am I going to follow and brother Brown said Pharaoh and Moses when they looked out upon the Israelite slaves Pharaoh saw slaves Moses saw God's people and that moved in his heart something has to be done hallelujah I mean so he forsook the riches of Egypt he left the superpower of the world of that time followed Christ into the desert hallelujah esteemed let's read that let's go to Hebrews 11 let's read the shall we uh you know I've decided to follow Jesus why would you turn back why would you turn back amen let's go to Hebrews 11 23 you know I was thinking last night yo Hebrews 11 we call it the faith chapter you can also call it the decision chapter hallelujah Amen by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come of years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God that enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he made a decision esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect and to recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured SC him who's invisible through faith he kept the Passover in the sprinkling of blood at least he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them I mean by faith they passed through the Red Sea as dry land which the Egyptians sa to do were drowned a minute so he esteemed this is why we read in the beginning we walk by faith and not by sight look real decisions are made by faith looking to the unseen right so Moses esteemed right he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt now human that you think but Moses you become fairer than you can just hit them free here the powder duty is God and the you know you're the Pharaoh was considered God in the nation he was the god of the nation right he could have said now you all go free and and he coulda seen tanaami before them and drove out everyone and then put them in the land he could have done it that way but we shouldn't make decisions based on our cattle understanding right we make our decisions based on the Word of God so now Moses Moses made a decision but then that but then there in in Moses day there was a another prophet called Balaam and he made the wrong decision he wanted money he loved money he sold his gift to the Moabites right and he ended up dead he ended up being an enemy of God a prophet with a true gift sold it for money he sold it he make the wrong decision but his nature was I love money I love shiny things right and so he sold out he made the wrong decision Korah and Dathan made the wrong decision they rose up against Moses you're not the only holy one in the group God speaks to us too and God swallowed them up the earth he opened the earth had swallowed them up they make the wrong decision Caleb and Joshua made the right decision hallelujah they didn't look at the enemies in the land as an obstacle they just looked them in the way you know they didn't say we can't take it because of them they said no God's given it God's given it our decision is based on the promise that we heard of Mount Sinai and if God can take us out of Egypt to Sinai he can take us in hallelujah there was the decision God's promised it we believe it let's go get it it should be the same thing with us God's promise that we believe it let's go get it I mean if he if the devil's taking your joy God's promise that you believe it go get it your peace your long-suffering but it might be the Holy Ghost amen you know your Jesus gives a parable of you know you know you asked your fathers for brandy won't give you a serpent you know all these yo as if they being evil know how to give good gifts how much more your father in heaven which will give the Holy Ghost them that ask him he goes down to that promise have you read that in the in the Gospels hallelu this way you've got ours you know make a decision Lord well and me use my life I haven't used these hands use these eyes users mouth use this body to manifest you hallelujah there should be that's the best decision amen so Caleb and Joshua made the right decision you know it's amazing we look at a many times we will look at what you know the we will look at the circumstance and we will praise God based or we won't praise and based on circumstance right we should never do that I mean we should praise God in spite of the circumstance our God our life our worship to God should be solely based on the promise not on what we see right a not on what we see but what well God's promises we read in Romans 4 Abraham made a right promise I mean it mean sorry the right decision God spoke to him leave this place and Canley he could think but there's all I know but no he made a decision I've heard the voice of God I'm following that voice he didn't have a Bible he didn't have Church to go to he was being led by the Spirit of God and he walked amen according to faith right and then he was well old up in age and it was impossible for him and Sarah to have the child did he start think you know was he quiet well one day we'll get it no he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God being fully persuaded that he was that what he had promised he was able to perform so Abraham for 25 years of saying hallelujah Isaac's on his way the next day hallelujah Isaac's on his way you feel any different Sarah and I feel the same hallelujah Isaac's on his way hallelujah and he was just praising God thanking him god inhabits the praise of his people I mean you want to see God move in your life begin to praise Him I mean you want to see victories happened praise them in the victory I mean give him thanks hallelujah just praise them before you see the victory that's what we're going to do we can't just sit back and say well I'll only be happy when he moves not be happy before you move wholly because you're really showing God do you take me at my word and you and you'll say yes I am by how I'm living I'm showing you I take you at your word hallelujah amen that's how we've got to beat amen Abraham praise them for 25 years and one day Sarah I think got a bit sick and tired of it I can't do the same take Haggai she made the wrong decision but God said no it's all part of my plan anyway but she had to receive a visitation Abraham had his visitation right he had had it numerous times over 25 years but then Sarah had to meet the same God that he knew and that's how it has to be in order to make the right decision you've got to meet him and he will guide your steps par lujah and then that then there on the plains of Mamre and then three men came walking hallelujah and and Abraham saw one of them and you know that one of them was God because he met him before hallelujah they began to have a conversation and that was Sarah's visitation hallelujah he followed me Amy and then she began to believe the promise but a brain for 25 years hallelujah Isaac's coming get ready get the nursery ready he's coming abre oh you you changed your name to Abraham father of Nations how convenient but where's the children they're coming many people say you made he he's been out in the Sun the old man's lost his mind and the Sun too long but he was strong I mean in faith giving glory to God fully persuaded that he was he would do what he had promised hallelujah that's why we should praise the Lord I mean before the victory comes we should just begin to go thank him he's promised that in his word who say Lord it's on its way holy the promise is on its way I mean one of the Kings I think it was Jehoshaphat the enemy came against him and the and and so so they called a prayer and a fast I think it's in seeking Chronicles and God said no I'll fight the battle you just go but I'll fight the battle and and he sent singers before singers before hallelujah and the and God said ambushment against the enemy and they didn't they didn't have to go fight that they still went out there but the singers went before the army and then when they got to the battlefield they found a lot of enemies but they're all dead hallelujah is because praise went before the army right praise went for praise and singing we're before hallelujah that's why I say you want to see your enemy defeated you just praise God you give him thanks it's more than just an emotion but from your heart Lord I believe your promise you're here to perform what I need hallelujah the enemies come against me but he will not stand hallelujah that's why you gotta get start thanking him don'tdon't doubt I've been don't doubt the promise how can this ever be say thank you for the promise Amen thank you for my children thank you for those people thank you for healing thank you for salvation that's what we're going to do you say but they are far off the Bible said the Holy Ghost is didn't that are far off hallelujah I mean and if he's given you the Holy Ghost and the promises for them to be following me the promises to you them that are afar off to your children as many as the Lord our God shall call so I think it's parents we should say thank you look I've received the Holy Ghost of promises for my children hallelujah hallelujah to God I mean those that are far off hey they can be the prodigal son made a decision he made a decision one day dad I'm sick of working here give me my inheritance now I want to lead my own life and then the father said sure do you think the father wasn't because Jesus need a certain man and a certain man had two sons so he's actually identifying actual circumstance right do you think that that father was joy sing here you go son here's your inheritance hallelujah to God go spend it no he would have been burdened you following me these are real people to me right and so he gives the inheritance he made the wrong decision but the ends of the Father now he knew his son would go that way God knows the way we go right we think we have it all together with a master of our own suing us God knows the road you'll go right he he knows what you're thinking even now hallelujah you know many times you think well though I'll just be a will to myself and I'll just keep drooling here and it's like a megaphone to heaven you know our thoughts speak louder and heaven than our words on earth right and then so now the prodigal son goes off and he spends his money with your riotous living thinking he's having a wonderful time but then he comes to himself in a pigpen and he made the right decision you following me I mean this is more than a story I mean but sometimes we have to hit rock bottom sometimes we've got to have our back maybe in a hospital bed or something for God to get yo I'm listening now hallelujah because our own stubborn fallen nature will take us a certain way and it's always the wrong way right and then so the prodigal son comes to he says and then he came to himself in the Pigpen saying my father's servants have more than this if only I just become one of his servants and all will be well and so it begins to make his way back home and it says when the father saw him afar off do you think that father wasn't praying do you think he just said well send me an email or send me a text when you arrive you know send me a selfie with no he was praised hallelujah this this father was praying and he was under expectation and one day they pray through hallelujah and they had a something settled on their souls he's coming home Johnny's coming home hallelujah and they begin to look and the father kept looking you see thank you lord my son will come thank you Lord my son will come hallelujah this is the current yes he's in the Book of Isaiah this is the coven I'll make with you that my word will not depart out of the mouth of thy seed of thy seed seed from henceforth forever hallelujah that means they've got to come back are you following me and then so he was watching then the son comes home he made the right decision hallelujah and then the father restored the son back to where he was amen because he says to his other son who was unhappy he stayed he says dad why are you having this party for you know I've been working all this time he's just been living living like the devil in the world and now you're happy he's back and as in the father hizdahr all this is yours he was once did now he's alive hallelujah amen so he came to himself and he made the right decision now the apostles were like men like us right the Bible would call them ignorant unlearned some of them couldn't sign their own name that's all right right but when the pressure came down see God God knows how to put us on the spot but he's not he's not trying to prove you wrong he's trying to prove what's in you and you can look back in life and say Lord it was your grace only that I made those choices right it's only you did it it wasn't me and what I thought of my perception my understanding it's you that kept me right and then son John chapter 6 when Jesus is having you know he starts with 5,000 he preaches a very short service and after the surface is finished under the disciples are standing next to him and he says to them as disciples will you also go away and Simon Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life see he couldn't he you know maybe they were suddenly say oh don't say that Jesus aw now he's going to answer right now he's going to make it clear he doesn't make it clear he just put it out there and that was it and then said now here were these ones they had to make a decision they made the right decision right because heaven was influencing them I mean to make the right decision he says and we believe in a sure that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God hallelujah they made the right decision amen we need to look to the unseen now we read about Ruth in the beginning it's incredible he's a woman all she seemed so Naomi and her husband and two sons coming to my web prices at time happens Ruth marries one of the sons or four marries the other son and then all the men in the family die and then now his Ruth you know know me here is that there's grain back in Israel the famines end of this grain back so she's I'm gonna return something I know said I'm going with you right she made she didn't know where she was going right she didn't know where what was going to befall her in that foreign land they were enemies Israel and Moab were enemies right but room something in her said your people now remember she saw a testimony all of us are a billboard for something you are God's billboard or you're the world's billboard what are you advertising your life is a billboard you say people don't notice me people notice us what are we advertising worth with how we treat people you know how we speak to people are we friendly you know are we loving are we kind are we thoughtful right what kind of life we producing and so now she saw know him his life and all she sees his death and misery really that's all she saw and she was part of that death and misery because her husband died in now knowing he says well I'm gonna go home and something interested I'm going with you she made a clear-cut decision where you die all die she burned every Bridge where you die all die your people be my people your God will be my god she doesn't she doesn't know what she was going to hallelujah but she made she was looking something moved her to make the right decision I believe that was the Lord with all my heart I mean she made a decision based upon faith and not by what she saw her other sister-in-law looked at what she saw and went home and you don't read about her anymore but Ruth followed Naomi I mean in a sport short space of time she was no longer a widow with nothing but she was married to Boaz the mighty man of wealth and she came into the economy of Israel hallelujah Amen it's the same thing with us God calls you do you know where you're going you know when I first met the law there's a whole lot of things I didn't know hallelujah it's like Abraham God called him he didn't know the boundaries of the land he didn't know what was going to happen God just said leave thy country I'll show you another place and as God walked with him as he walked with God God unfolds the vision further right it's like us you know I meet the Lord I didn't have a great expectation for a body change I just made up my son's were washed away I became a new creature the things I once did I couldn't do because the nature of me was changed I couldn't do it anymore I didn't try and say well I've got to keep myself from things no if God takes a nature out of your desire for the world then you you're not going to want it hallelujah that's like being a kid now this is very elementary all the little children here do you love Brussels sprouts and broccoli maybe some of us still don't anyway but there comes a time I'll put it this way I say your nature changes from a child to an adult and you eat the things and you like them right but when you're kid you're I don't like this you know because your nature doesn't want it right but your nature changes and then you want it because you know it's good for you you following me that's like me with drinking or anything in the world feels the thirst in here but then it died and then then I could live in a brewery and I'll be the most sober man in the world because there's nothing in me that wants it all right you know there's not seven steps to protect yourself and overcome no God changes your nature and you overcome you can't help but overcome because he is in you greater is in you that he's in the world hallelujah isn't that right yes oh that's and that's how we should be amen Rebecca made her decision one day she's walking to the well like probably every other day or every day he's a man says can you give me a drink he's got a whole bunch of camels and something in her emergencies okay I'll give you water and I'll water your camels she has no idea this man's been praying sweating out to find character brother Brahim says and he prays Lord the maiden that comes and doesn't only give me a drink but waters my camels may she be the one I'm looking for she's looking he is looking for someone from Abraham's house a relative I don't think there was such an easy thing to do that's just me but the very one he prays and in the very answer to prayer Bakr comes walking out holy and then she doesn't know she should she doesn't know an Angels been sent to prepare her she doesn't know that an Angels being sent to prepare her heart that she'll come and marry this Isaac she has no idea about Isaac she's just living her life hallelujah and we were the same way you know we just hear this just wait and then in his Rebekah so she waters the camels gives gives um Eliezer a drink goes back to her house and then so her family says well where does the man go get him so here he comes along they sit down I began to have some fellowship where are you from I am I am Abraham's chief servant he said Oh what are you doing here he sent me on a mission I'm looking for a bride for my for for my master's son Isaac and Abraham said that his angel the angel Lord would go before him and will prepare her heart and are standing by the well and US pranks I don't know who I was looking for I said Lord the one who water it gives me water and what does my camels may she be the one and then Rebecca comes and she began to realize this is more than just me being helpful today hey you following me this is more than me just being helpful I'm actually part of a fulfilled prayer I'm part of a vision I'm actually part of the Word of God being fulfilled hallelujah it's because something moved in her eye water your camels or your thirsty or the if there's I'll help you camels drink a lot you know they don't just have a bit of a sip they drink there was a lot of work but something had moved in her I'll do it that was God guiding her decision may we be God in the same way and then now here she is she hears this and then Eliezer says well I found her I believe let's go and then as her family says you ask her something gunner says I'll go I'll go and you'd really think about it see you're going to this arranged marriage you never seen this guy you have no photos this guy just turned up and he claims to be the servant of Abraham's have you done a background check you know seem to text to someone someone may know him on Facebook somewhere you know how do you how do you know think about it she's following she's gonna jump on a camel with this guy and go to a land she doesn't know right and they say go with her now I asked you a question if one who has daughters here well I'm by the vast majority of them but what you some guy just pictures up some some some older guy and long lost lost lost relative or in those days it was okay that way my Master's son needs a wife and I came here I want to take you know and then I prayed and then this happened and you know she's the one would you scale your praise Lord go on you think naturally you wouldn't do it naturally right you do chicks you'd get on the phone you'd be finding out think about it we're we're people of like patient where we have Menem woman just like them but the decisions were move by it was God influence the decision right and I trust it's the same thing with you God calls you as he called you right more than just learning and more than just being raised in church God's got to speak to you personally I trust he's spoken to you called you and then you begin to find out it's more than just a haphazard thing but you're part of the family hallelujah cuz Rebecca was part of Isaac's family right and then so now there is a call and she was influenced by the call and you get moved by the word having an you says you mean this is Jesus in heaven I'm called to be united with him and his spirit is upon the earth finding his bride howling he seemed to serve it with all the gifts I mean to make sure she's fully furnished with everything she needs I mean to take her on her journey hallelujah amen keeping her to find out the age of the Lord is upon the earth finding his elected ones and you begin to find out I'm I'm one of them I'm one of them hallelujah so now you have to look at now I'm gonna I'm just gonna close with a little more but ask you the question what is influencing your decisions there is two powers upon the earth and they will even at a young age your decisions are being influenced right and you will find if as time goes on decisions you make even as a young person they will they will direct your path a certain way who's made decision in though young and you're still living at the result of that decision right if one every one of us did some of us said well let's move it to the other side of the world there was a decision and here you are right my dad moved from South Africa years ago he made a decision I'm gonna leave the country any and here he is I made a decision I'm going to Christchurch it seemed like such a small thing my friend said to me come studying come study go Canterbury University okay oh dude I just decided like that and there I was you know seems like small things but God you got to pray Lord guide my decisions because I do not know I can't guide myself it sees in Jeremiah he says O Lord I know it's not within man should we find that should we they put me on the spot I put myself on the spot but let's go to Jeremiah I'll find it then I'll tell you where it is it loves the Lord the sporting I'm so glad we can be guided by his by his voice I mean so here we are Jeremiah 10:23 we just close with the scripture Jeremiah 10 and 23 and Jeremiah was very much I think he's very aware of this he had a vision that the Babylonian is going to come and destroy the country and the people weren't listening to him because they won't do their own thing it sees in Jeremiah 10 in 23 oh lord I know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps right so Jeremiah was very honest he says Lord I know it's not within us to direct our steps it's not within us that's why we need someone else graded us to guide our decisions right to guide our path we can't just say well I'll make up my choice and this is what I want to do when he say Lord guide my decisions not my will but thy will be done that's the greatest victory you could have in life where you surrender your will to the Lord Jesus Christ the word and let him direct your steps then you'll have victory in life right but if you go your own way well I've got my life before me I'll do what I want I mean you'll end up like the protocol son amen but it's the Lord's great but you don't want to end up that way why have why why walk down a road and come back you got to carry a bunch of scars right you can't push the theory's button you can't push the erase button in here your memory remembers right it's part of you amen God gives you overcoming power of those things but you still carry them hallelujah that's like the earth the earth has great scars right you can drive along you see where where the Earth's crust is lifted up who's seen a great big cliffs and you see all the cedar must be put you know you can see the rock you know it changes color you see it's been pushed up great big massive earthquakes and things the earth carries scars right and it carries these things that still you could say within its memory one day won't carry those scars no more one day it's going to be be made new right and it's like us we're now in our memories we can still carry great emotional scars amen right we do whether we like it or not we see things we don't want to see we experience things that we never wanted to experience and we carry great scars because of them right and that's why we need a new body hello Lou that's why we're going to receive a new body right but we carry those scars and times only think lord I wish I never went that way right but you've got to come with peace with yourself Lord even in my own folly you allowed me to go that way amen but why go get the skies when you don't need them if some souvenirs you don't want to get right and scars from the world as you don't want so you've got to say Lord I want to make the right decisions right Lord guide my decisions and may make my nature be your nature I don't want to I don't want to repent just because I've done wrong I want to really repent that you don't just forgive me but you changed my nature that I don't fall back into the same sin right like I've said about the man like a man who's fallen into debt and a rich man comes and pays off the debt now that man who who wasn't it and that's been paid off he can be thankful that it's been paid but unless his nature has changed he can fall into the same debt right and that's like us the Lord justifies us we're justified by faith but we still carry the same nature right that's a start of the walk right but then he's got to cleanse us right it's got to wash us change our spirit change our desires right but then we can still fall into the same debt are you following me but then if he himself comes and dwells in us just like the spirit if the spirit of that rich man went to the winds of the man who wasn't dead that man wouldn't fall into debt again because he has the spirit of that rich man right it's the same thing with the Lord at the Spirit of God comes into us and not just only changes but now he takes control we won't fall into the same traps we do under our first birth you're following me right that's why our decisions going to be Lord take my nature and change it then it becomes your nature oh yeah not just to repent because you got caught or you did something bad you've got to do that you've got to repent when you do wrong but you got to pray until God changes your nature they don't fall into the same pitfall you did before because our nature will lead us down the wrong road as if one quite clear on their right our own human nature were born with it will lead us down the wrong road it will make us do the wrong decisions in life amen that's why you know the biggest enemy you have is yourself you know the biggest enemy the devil was defeated on Calvary right hell he doesn't have the keys to his own house anymore he's defeated and he still is defeated but the biggest enemy you have is you right you are the one that gets in the way of you right you're the one who gets in the way god you're the one who actually you know you're the one who puts the speed yeah puts the brakes on amen that's why the Lord died amen watch this of our sin ascended on high poured Becca's Holy Ghost upon people that God would come and dwell in man that his spirit would overcome this flesh hallelujah amen and said now that's why friends let's make the right decision amen this just bow heads it a word of Prayer shall we but anyone like the agreement of priests want to raise your hand to the Lord gracious father you see the hands that are raised this morning Lord I have both hands up Lord because this flesh Lord this the Lord as the Apostle Paul said in Romans 7 there's the there's the law of sin that worketh in the flesh there's also the law of life your Holy Spirit it is our wretched man that I am the things that I would do I do not the things I don't do the those are things I do there's that war of their two natures but lord we thank you by your Holy Spirit within us Lord we have overcoming power law that this flesh should stay in subjection and lord I thank you that Lord you change our nature's father Lord that you don't just reform us and patch us up you make us new creatures in you and dear God I pray you take these chopped-up words Lord and
