[45:07] seed shall possess the gate of his
[45:10] enemies heavenly father
[45:13] please lord bless your weight you
[45:15] promised it father that where two or
[45:18] three are gathered in my name you shall
[45:20] be there
[45:21] lord is not only two here tonight lord
[45:24] and we ask for your favor we ask for
[45:27] your unmerited grace lord we ask father
[45:30] god for your inspiration we ask that you
[45:33] be the speaker here tonight bless your
[45:36] weight father to the hearts of your
[45:37] children
[45:38] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[45:40] ask thanksgiving amen
[45:43] please enjoy the comfort
[45:46] and
[45:47] i would like us to speak tonight about a
[45:49] thought
[45:50] uh i'll read this one but i would like
[45:52] us to talk about that
[45:55] that title or that topic
[45:58] which is position then possession
[46:01] uh we all understand those ways brothers
[46:04] and sisters are we together do we all
[46:06] understand those three ways there
[46:08] position
[46:09] then
[46:10] possession let's read john
[46:13] when jesus therefore had received the
[46:15] vinegar this is what the pastor read
[46:17] recently am i right hey brother ben
[46:20] when jesus therefore had received the
[46:23] vinegar he said it is finished the
[46:26] reason i underlined that that a
[46:29] way
[46:30] well it's underlined in the bible is is
[46:32] also read but i would have also bolded
[46:34] it
[46:34] is because
[46:36] the lord himself said uh
[46:38] we are we are at the end now is done
[46:40] everything is completed
[46:43] you'll see why i'm saying that as we go
[46:45] along and he bowed his head
[46:47] and gave up the ghost because it was
[46:49] finished
[46:51] right so it sounds like what the lord is
[46:53] saying there that the job is done
[46:57] i always give an example about me and
[46:59] mario
[47:00] sorry brother marion you happen to work
[47:02] with me brother i'm so sorry
[47:04] when we are done
[47:06] you if you hear marion saying brother
[47:08] paul that's us you know that is finished
[47:12] we are going
[47:13] home
[47:14] which means the job for the day is done
[47:18] right so is it finished it is finished
[47:21] meaning it means so much
[47:24] it's done
[47:27] that's what the pastor said now that
[47:29] topic i i want you to think about two
[47:32] ways mainly
[47:33] position
[47:34] and possession possession
[47:36] is when you
[47:38] own something when you take something to
[47:41] be yours
[47:42] right when you take ownership of
[47:44] something when you go and take something
[47:48] and now is at your disposal
[47:50] right you are now possessing it
[47:53] right whether it was yours before
[47:55] whether you fought with somebody and you
[47:57] won that thing whether you you whatever
[48:00] you did but as long as now you you you
[48:03] are in possession that is your position
[48:07] but we find out that
[48:10] and the position
[48:13] is very critical towards you getting
[48:17] your possession
[48:18] and that's what we want to look at
[48:20] tonight can i take off my jacket is it
[48:22] okay
[48:23] so we we need to look at that aspect of
[48:26] your position
[48:28] in relation to
[48:30] your position
[48:31] why is it so important to first be in
[48:34] position
[48:35] why is it so important it sounds like
[48:38] your position
[48:40] determines your
[48:42] possession
[48:43] ah
[48:45] okay let's look at this
[48:47] how many how many knows
[48:49] who what what what what is this picture
[48:51] here
[48:52] huh
[48:53] you see if you look at that pitch that
[48:55] is a football ground
[48:57] it's a soccer or soccer or football
[48:59] ground and you see that those people
[49:02] they they if you don't know you'll say
[49:04] oh oh they made a nice little pattern
[49:07] yeah but in actual fact those people are
[49:10] standing in
[49:11] positions
[49:14] those who know football i didn't have a
[49:15] better example
[49:17] i i don't know much cricket or rugby or
[49:20] even baseball what did they call it
[49:22] basketball i know this one this one i
[49:24] know it
[49:25] so you see these people here you it's
[49:27] what you call okay firstly before we
[49:29] move on who can tell me what is missing
[49:30] in these positions
[49:32] there's something important that is
[49:34] missing in these positions so i'm not
[49:36] it's not a soccer test quiz
[49:38] i just want to to show you the
[49:40] importance of position ah i want to ask
[49:43] girls because i know boys will know
[49:46] sister rebecca i like i like your i like
[49:49] your you know your determination
[49:51] what is missing
[49:53] you see
[49:54] there's something that is missing here
[49:58] now this these guys are supposed to be
[50:00] 11 but there are only 10
[50:02] you see so something is already not in
[50:05] position
[50:06] in that picture that we are seeing
[50:08] are we together but the people are well
[50:11] organized
[50:12] this is the back line
[50:14] you know this is the back line the super
[50:16] is there this is the central midfield
[50:19] these are all uh our uh uh we call them
[50:22] what do you call them jasmine the
[50:23] winners or the wingers is the difference
[50:26] then these are the strikers the front
[50:28] line so these guys are the engine
[50:30] of the game
[50:32] these guys are the goal scorers usually
[50:34] we need somebody who can run who cannot
[50:37] and some of these guys are meet
[50:38] attackers you know so these are the guys
[50:41] who defend our goals
[50:43] so each and everyone be in position but
[50:46] there's no goalkeeper so how can we win
[50:48] that match
[50:50] but they are organized
[50:52] they are put in their position
[50:55] let's look at that one
[50:57] what do you think of this one
[51:01] you see
[51:02] that i don't know if these guys are
[51:04] organized
[51:05] i don't know if these guys are in
[51:06] position
[51:08] or each and everyone is on their but i
[51:10] see everyone with their ball with a ball
[51:13] everyone wants to score
[51:15] in this picture here
[51:17] do you think this pattern will work
[51:19] this one maybe but do you think this one
[51:22] will work
[51:23] everyone wants to score everyone wants
[51:26] to get credit everyone wants to take
[51:29] position everyone wants to to win the
[51:31] best man of the match can you see in
[51:34] that picture so it won't work there's
[51:36] not even an organization there
[51:38] but let's look at this one
[51:40] this is the last picture but i just want
[51:42] to show you to demonstrate or illustrate
[51:44] the importance of being in position
[51:47] look at that similar to the one to the
[51:49] first one but the
[51:51] what's the difference there
[51:53] sister lilia what's the difference
[51:57] there's a goalie
[51:59] there's a goalie you get 95 percent
[52:02] they say goalie oh you i give you a
[52:04] hundred there is a goalie there i'm
[52:06] sorry there's a goalie here now this
[52:09] formation looks normal
[52:11] right
[52:12] it looks normal everyone
[52:15] is in their
[52:17] position
[52:18] but it's still not the end of the game
[52:21] yet
[52:22] the game is only beginning
[52:25] the the ultimate purpose of this
[52:28] arrangement where everybody must be
[52:30] in a in a position is that we must get a
[52:34] possession yeah
[52:36] the people even in football even rugby
[52:38] every other game you'll hear another
[52:40] analyst saying and oh but those guys had
[52:43] a possession man they had 80 possession
[52:46] of the ball throughout the game meaning
[52:48] they were in control likely those guys
[52:51] have won the game
[52:52] in most cases
[52:54] it's very very unusual that we dominate
[52:56] and we are in possession of the ball and
[52:58] everything and then we lose
[53:02] it happens
[53:04] it happens in the wealthy patterns but
[53:07] the message is
[53:09] you'll get your position and
[53:12] your possession
[53:13] you win the game brother
[53:15] so now the introduction that i wanted is
[53:18] that what what what is the position we
[53:20] if the position you know at work
[53:22] you know in different positions people
[53:24] have got positions a position is a it's
[53:28] a is the allocation of your your
[53:31] responsibility the allocation of your
[53:33] duty that you you you are sitting your
[53:36] position describes you
[53:39] yeah your position describes that uh you
[53:42] are a cleaner
[53:43] or you are a ceo
[53:45] your position explains you that you are
[53:48] a mother or you are a child
[53:50] that's your position so we don't want to
[53:52] be out of position
[53:54] we don't want to be those people
[53:56] remember remember
[53:58] the rule here is there's not there's no
[54:00] rule that says
[54:02] this man here cannot score a goal
[54:05] but he's at the back line
[54:08] but there's no rule that says he cannot
[54:10] score a goal but he needs to maintain
[54:12] his position
[54:14] in order i forgot to put my voice
[54:15] tonight
[54:17] you don't mind about time
[54:20] uh uh uh i must i must have spent how
[54:23] many brothers maybe
[54:25] five minutes
[54:26] i must give it give it three hey
[54:29] let's give it three so we'll start with
[54:32] three and minus three at the end
[54:34] god bless you
[54:36] all right now what i'm saying is that
[54:40] uh
[54:41] we we may be all in our positions but
[54:43] remember each and everyone will get a
[54:46] position you've got the possessions
[54:48] allocated to you based on how you're
[54:50] utilizing your position
[54:52] you cannot get a possession when you are
[54:55] out of position are we together now a
[54:57] position is something that is described
[54:59] so many things in it and it ultimately
[55:03] helps you to exercise and to get your
[55:06] possession
[55:07] right that is why you need to have a
[55:09] position that is why you need to be in
[55:12] position now there is the physical side
[55:15] and there's the spiritual side we'll
[55:17] talk a little bit about the physical
[55:19] side just to demonstrate
[55:21] how to apply it on the spiritual side on
[55:23] the physical side you'll find that
[55:26] and
[55:27] if a
[55:28] a a manager
[55:30] a manager
[55:32] can be out of his position
[55:34] the firm
[55:35] runs amok
[55:37] the fam loses the profit because the man
[55:40] is out of position he's supposed to be
[55:42] giving us the strategy
[55:44] business strategy he's supposed to be
[55:46] giving us the direction where are we
[55:48] going leading us um and or if you find
[55:51] that our cleaner she's busy trying to do
[55:55] it
[55:59] where do you think we will be each one
[56:01] must be within their positions but
[56:03] remember the ultimate goal is that the
[56:04] firm must make profit
[56:08] the ultimate goal is that the team must
[56:10] win
[56:11] and have possession
[56:12] of the game and get a cup or an award
[56:15] right that's the ultimate goal but
[56:18] wha wha what is therefore a possession
[56:21] is something that you you get something
[56:24] that you take something that you you win
[56:26] something that you are given
[56:28] right after you have get you have used
[56:31] your position the prophet says them
[56:33] now that's who
[56:36] now that's who his address
[56:39] it to in jesus the believer's position
[56:42] is in christ
[56:45] and christ will only meet the believer
[56:48] the believer can only worship christ as
[56:51] he is positionally placed in christ you
[56:54] see so we need to be positional let's
[56:57] quickly switch to the spiritual right
[56:59] now we need to be spiritually placed in
[57:01] the world
[57:02] that is our purpose each and everyone
[57:05] while we want to be positionally placed
[57:07] in a church
[57:09] while we want to be positionally placed
[57:10] in your home while we want to be
[57:12] positionally placed at our work while we
[57:15] want to be positionally placed in the
[57:17] music each and every one of his
[57:19] orchestra
[57:20] is in a position
[57:22] while we want to be
[57:24] in that way
[57:26] but we also wants to be positionally
[57:28] placed in the weight
[57:30] and that's the main important one and
[57:32] that's what i want to drive your
[57:33] thoughts or your hearts towards this
[57:35] evening apply the spiritual life apply
[57:38] the physical life and then we'll be able
[57:40] to see it better are we together
[57:43] now he says here the prophet in that
[57:45] spoken word god's provided we we cannot
[57:47] have a healing service here until people
[57:50] get in the spirit of the healing service
[57:54] how can you get into the spirit of rugby
[57:57] but you are playing soccer
[58:01] are we together you you you
[58:04] you need ev that is what places you in
[58:06] position a position is not just one
[58:10] thing that we say ah no no no no you
[58:13] need to have a
[58:14] bigger higher brother nd high level
[58:17] overview what do you call it a bigger
[58:19] picture
[58:20] you need to understand the bigger
[58:21] picture you need to understand your own
[58:23] position and have a picture of your
[58:25] position and your position how it
[58:27] relates with other positions
[58:30] are we together brothers and sisters i
[58:32] mustn't lose you here
[58:33] your position in relation to other
[58:35] positions
[58:36] right the word of god is where me and
[58:39] you are placed
[58:41] positionally
[58:42] right and if you we miss it
[58:46] that's why the prophet says we cannot
[58:47] have a healing service here until people
[58:50] get in the spirit of the healing service
[58:52] we cannot have
[58:53] have a volume of the holy ghost until
[58:56] people get in that kind of atmosphere
[59:00] his position atmosphere
[59:03] ah
[59:04] and the people once
[59:06] and the people was in the atmosphere in
[59:09] that day to bring judgment upon the
[59:11] earth you see so that is in that spoken
[59:14] word god provided way of worship there
[59:16] is a way in which god have set up a team
[59:19] called the end time bride in the end of
[59:22] the ages in the seven church ages and
[59:25] god has said okay seven churches first
[59:27] age second a state fought fifth six
[59:29] seven and a god in that age he also set
[59:33] up an arrangement and in the seven
[59:35] church age there are those that are
[59:36] going to be at the end of the line
[59:39] so each and everyone is positionally
[59:41] placed so we need to have that i that
[59:44] that mindset of understanding the body
[59:47] and your position within the body
[59:51] are we together
[59:53] that is why when we eat communion
[59:56] huh that is why when we eat communion
[59:58] system
[59:59] we say that um
[1:00:01] we we we we we prepare ourselves
[1:00:05] we get ready to eat communion we
[1:00:07] understand the solemnity the importance
[1:00:10] and the and that this is insanity
[1:00:13] the importance and the holiness of
[1:00:15] communion as an ordinance that the lord
[1:00:17] has given and we come with all sincerity
[1:00:22] how can i come with all sincerity when
[1:00:24] i'm angry with brother ben
[1:00:27] how can i
[1:00:28] how can i come with sincerity when
[1:00:31] certain things
[1:00:32] there's still some blockages no no
[1:00:34] everything must be flushed and ready to
[1:00:36] stand here
[1:00:38] because why
[1:00:40] i understand the body
[1:00:42] i understand the meaning of my position
[1:00:45] are we together
[1:00:47] so so so paul says in there what does
[1:00:49] the scripture say
[1:00:51] he says
[1:00:53] we we sleep because we don't descend the
[1:00:56] body
[1:00:57] we i believe that he also mean it
[1:00:59] spiritually we slumber
[1:01:02] because we don't
[1:01:04] want to recognize
[1:01:06] the body
[1:01:08] if we can't recognize the body can you
[1:01:09] recognize our position in the body
[1:01:12] your influence
[1:01:14] in the body
[1:01:16] are we together
[1:01:17] i want to go slow tonight brother isaac
[1:01:21] so um let's read the next one there
[1:01:24] and i don't believe you you get it
[1:01:27] that's not me that's the prophet i don't
[1:01:29] believe you get it
[1:01:31] let me go another route
[1:01:33] look look
[1:01:34] a believer cannot worship and hate has
[1:01:37] no right to worship a believer cannot
[1:01:40] worship and has no right to worship no
[1:01:43] man has the right to worship the lord
[1:01:45] outside of being in the body of the lord
[1:01:47] jesus christ did you know that
[1:01:50] he's asking
[1:01:52] it's so important to be in line to be in
[1:01:55] position
[1:01:57] because that's what that's what helps
[1:01:59] you to achieve your ultimate possession
[1:02:02] otherwise you're gonna take sister
[1:02:03] mike's position
[1:02:05] thinking that it's yours
[1:02:07] otherwise we're gonna grapple and fight
[1:02:09] for possessions
[1:02:10] we find that no no we're all speaking in
[1:02:12] tongues
[1:02:13] i'm not saying we can't
[1:02:15] but
[1:02:16] each one every one of us has been given
[1:02:18] possessions
[1:02:19] but we need to be in our position
[1:02:22] in order to get our positions
[1:02:24] that's the thought tonight
[1:02:27] and uh
[1:02:28] the prophet there is a very powerful
[1:02:30] statement
[1:02:31] and sorry i didn't quote there but that
[1:02:34] comes from this spoken word
[1:02:36] what i was reading for you know it comes
[1:02:38] from believers position
[1:02:40] in christ if you see any other quote
[1:02:42] from now on that is not it's got no
[1:02:45] reference
[1:02:46] it comes from this spoken word
[1:02:49] i'm just putting in the stream
[1:02:52] others like this will will say god's
[1:02:55] provided way amen
[1:02:57] now he says here the man of god look in
[1:02:59] the old testament back there
[1:03:04] back there when the believer they had a
[1:03:06] tabernacle and in the tabernacle no man
[1:03:09] had the right to do worship unless he
[1:03:11] come to the tabernacle
[1:03:13] who is the tabernacle
[1:03:18] in this case the lord is our ark
[1:03:21] the lord is the tabernacle the word the
[1:03:23] lord is the word the lord is the place
[1:03:26] of worship we come together to meet in
[1:03:28] this body which is the head the head is
[1:03:31] the lord jesus christ we are the body
[1:03:32] and we come in that body
[1:03:35] are we together
[1:03:36] in that there's a mystical body but
[1:03:38] there's a bigger body
[1:03:40] ah that bigger body is headed by the
[1:03:42] lord jesus christ and we come in there
[1:03:45] and in the old testament the believers
[1:03:48] did not could not go and worship him
[1:03:51] anyway
[1:03:53] you had to come to the tabernacle and
[1:03:55] when you come to the tabernacle you must
[1:03:57] be in the right attire you must be in
[1:04:00] with the right animal you must come with
[1:04:02] the right
[1:04:03] arrangement
[1:04:05] to be within your position otherwise
[1:04:08] they present you back
[1:04:10] that's me and you brothers and sisters
[1:04:12] we come with all our hearts we come with
[1:04:15] all our dedication with all our lives
[1:04:18] by the way we still fail
[1:04:21] and that's why we come
[1:04:23] for him to
[1:04:24] help us as we die daily he help us he go
[1:04:28] every step of the way with us
[1:04:31] but we must come
[1:04:32] the right way within our positions are
[1:04:34] we together
[1:04:36] i want to read the next one the next one
[1:04:38] says spending time within that
[1:04:40] atmosphere
[1:04:42] this atmosphere start with me brother
[1:04:44] ben the day that you mentioned that
[1:04:46] atmosphere is everything
[1:04:47] how many can remember this atmosphere is
[1:04:50] everything
[1:04:52] you need to be in that atmosphere to
[1:04:54] maintain your position
[1:04:56] or you must be in your position to
[1:04:58] maintain your atmosphere whichever way
[1:05:00] that you like to put it
[1:05:02] all of the above but
[1:05:04] it was enoch who claimed that he worked
[1:05:07] with god
[1:05:08] for 500 years and had a testimony he
[1:05:11] pleased god
[1:05:13] in other words enoch maintained his
[1:05:16] position to walk
[1:05:18] within the word of god are we together
[1:05:21] he had faith that he wouldn't see death
[1:05:26] can i do that
[1:05:29] you can
[1:05:30] me
[1:05:31] and you can
[1:05:33] be so positionally placed until we
[1:05:36] believe that we are not going to see
[1:05:38] death and we believe it
[1:05:40] and we will sit in that position until
[1:05:43] you please god so much
[1:05:45] that he takes you
[1:05:47] and then you are found to be no more on
[1:05:49] this earth why just simply because of
[1:05:52] maintaining your position
[1:05:56] there wasn't even a jet plane in those
[1:05:59] days to get him off his feet
[1:06:02] but god provided a way a translation
[1:06:04] that took enoch from earth to glory
[1:06:06] without receiving death that's what me
[1:06:08] that's that's what is within reach today
[1:06:12] i'm not telling you tales brothers and
[1:06:14] sisters that is what is within reach to
[1:06:16] me and to you today
[1:06:18] is within reach in what sense because
[1:06:20] look look at it this way
[1:06:24] uh we always say the devil
[1:06:27] is quite experienced you know what
[1:06:29] sometimes i get a bit annoyed that we
[1:06:32] are praising him so we are giving him
[1:06:33] too much credit well it's true he had
[1:06:36] fought the battles
[1:06:37] even though he never won he has fought
[1:06:39] them we say he's got six thousand years
[1:06:41] of experience but the occupant we say so
[1:06:44] and we say you know and it's true but we
[1:06:46] are only saying that to try to show you
[1:06:48] that this enemy when you come to him you
[1:06:50] only bring jesus you must only bring the
[1:06:53] weight because but but you see it sounds
[1:06:55] like he's so powerful
[1:06:59] huh but if he is so powerful
[1:07:02] he is god the arc enemy who is quite
[1:07:05] trillion powerful
[1:07:07] than him
[1:07:08] quite really on i don't have the higher
[1:07:10] number this is the person maybe you can
[1:07:12] tell me what is the highest number
[1:07:14] zillion
[1:07:16] yeah what is that one number
[1:07:20] his enemies more he created him
[1:07:24] right that is on the side where the
[1:07:26] devil thinks he is powerful
[1:07:28] ah and if he thinks that
[1:07:31] we believe that he's so weak
[1:07:33] he's so weak
[1:07:35] before the lord he's so weak because
[1:07:37] inside
[1:07:38] even us he's below us
[1:07:41] as who were born in sin god has put the
[1:07:44] capability inside you that the devil can
[1:07:47] be down there
[1:07:49] that powerful guy who's called six
[1:07:50] thousand years
[1:07:51] of battle
[1:07:53] huh so he doesn't win it whether he
[1:07:55] feels his powerful we've got jesus if
[1:07:57] he's small he we are above him
[1:08:00] are we together do you get the analogy
[1:08:02] for the idol you get it there i i don't
[1:08:04] want the boys to sleep sorry
[1:08:06] mo are you awake
[1:08:08] there's the pastor when you when you
[1:08:10] sleep
[1:08:11] he says wait i'm not going to waste my
[1:08:13] same one you can sleep at school
[1:08:16] wake up my boy
[1:08:17] he does that so i i don't know if i'll
[1:08:20] be within
[1:08:21] my eyes too
[1:08:23] to introduce that and say okay let's
[1:08:25] just pause a bit
[1:08:26] and then go and wake up every day and
[1:08:29] say no no my boy you'll sleep in school
[1:08:31] then not in here
[1:08:34] to really make a point to the devil you
[1:08:36] don't sleep in here
[1:08:38] hallelujah
[1:08:39] can we say amen to that
[1:08:41] now let's move to the next slide now god
[1:08:45] now god said then abraham in order to
[1:08:48] work with me you've got to separate
[1:08:50] yourself
[1:08:51] from the rest of them
[1:08:53] we saw a picture at the beginning of
[1:08:55] people that were like separated
[1:08:58] why because each and everyone must be in
[1:09:00] their position to get their possession
[1:09:03] you cannot just we just play we just
[1:09:05] stand in a group in a football match we
[1:09:08] are just in a group
[1:09:09] and we are saying we are going to win a
[1:09:10] match the other guys that opponent have
[1:09:12] taken their position they are spreading
[1:09:14] they are opening edges they are opening
[1:09:16] spaces
[1:09:17] you know the language they they're
[1:09:19] opening spaces to win this game to for
[1:09:21] passes to come we are standing in a
[1:09:23] group we say we want to win this game in
[1:09:25] a group like this right right in a
[1:09:27] soccer match you lost
[1:09:28] we must take posie you we must not
[1:09:31] separated in the sense of not working
[1:09:33] together but spread
[1:09:35] to be able to attack
[1:09:38] so abraham had to be separated
[1:09:42] from his people he had to be separated
[1:09:44] god demands a total separation but you
[1:09:48] want to bring a lot of the world along
[1:09:50] with you why
[1:09:54] even our father did it our father
[1:09:56] abraham
[1:09:57] even him he did it he allowed lord to
[1:10:00] come with him
[1:10:01] and lord came with him
[1:10:06] in his position
[1:10:07] how will he get this position if he's
[1:10:09] dragging others we can't drag people
[1:10:11] into heaven
[1:10:12] i take my position you take yours you
[1:10:15] know my wife was telling me
[1:10:18] because the brother was preaching about
[1:10:21] and
[1:10:21] it was at a couple's meeting
[1:10:23] and then he was preaching and said you
[1:10:26] find the brothers telling the sisters
[1:10:27] that
[1:10:28] yo listen
[1:10:30] the word of god says you must obey her
[1:10:32] your husband the brothers will sit on
[1:10:34] that point
[1:10:37] they will sit on it disney brother will
[1:10:39] sit on it
[1:10:40] but you see
[1:10:42] that the point is this that scripture is
[1:10:44] meant to the system
[1:10:46] to confess it to exercise it
[1:10:49] it's not for me to to tell no no it's
[1:10:51] for her to take it and use it
[1:10:54] my scripture is to say
[1:10:56] husband do what
[1:10:59] that's for mine not for her to be saying
[1:11:02] hey remember
[1:11:04] each one must be in their position as
[1:11:07] long as each one can be in their
[1:11:08] positions
[1:11:09] nothing will go out of cata
[1:11:11] but we find that we say no hey listen
[1:11:14] the bible says you must respect me
[1:11:17] no no
[1:11:18] me i'm a sister i listen to the bible i
[1:11:21] eat the word of god i exercise it
[1:11:23] that's my part
[1:11:25] you do yours i do yours
[1:11:27] we are in our position we win the game
[1:11:31] isn't it
[1:11:32] i i'm not saying we can't correct one
[1:11:34] another but all i'm saying is that we
[1:11:36] shouldn't be say
[1:11:38] no no each one takes their part
[1:11:41] number backline goalkeeper whoever we
[1:11:45] play the game we pass the ball to one
[1:11:47] another we win
[1:11:49] we get our possession that's the whole
[1:11:51] idea right i didn't hear much amen from
[1:11:54] brothers
[1:11:57] then by this
[1:11:59] uh then by his holy spirit seeing that
[1:12:01] the mother was to be part of the sun
[1:12:04] also because they are part of the flesh
[1:12:06] then the holy spirit were working
[1:12:07] through those these people and said he
[1:12:11] let your seed possess the gate of the
[1:12:13] enemy
[1:12:15] then god answering he would possess the
[1:12:18] gate of the enemy right now now it was
[1:12:22] god telling abraham about
[1:12:25] what is going to happen to his seat we
[1:12:28] are taking our possession today because
[1:12:32] abraham took his position
[1:12:34] that is why we are we are doing
[1:12:36] what our father did like father like
[1:12:42] then god answered swearing he would
[1:12:44] possess the gate of the enemy
[1:12:47] then what position does that put the
[1:12:49] church of the living god
[1:12:53] where does that put us
[1:12:55] we are the seat of abraham amen
[1:12:58] and we are possessing the gates of our
[1:13:01] enemy today we are possessing them
[1:13:03] because we are by by virtue of us being
[1:13:06] abraham's sons and daughters we are
[1:13:09] taking we have to you know there's no
[1:13:11] way whether you like it or not you are
[1:13:13] god's seed and that will happen have you
[1:13:16] ever seen an orange saying no no me i'll
[1:13:17] be a banana i'll be a banana no no no
[1:13:20] coming out wanting to be a banana it is
[1:13:22] unarranged by by by by creation
[1:13:26] so you can't deny yourself
[1:13:28] you you so this is to remind you that
[1:13:31] hey as you grow make sure that you
[1:13:34] become a fresh banana or a fresh orange
[1:13:37] make sure that in in your you do it so
[1:13:40] well within your position that's the
[1:13:42] thinking are we together
[1:13:43] we are abraham seed for we being dead in
[1:13:47] christ we are take on abraham's seed and
[1:13:50] our air with him under the same sun
[1:13:52] promise that that goes
[1:13:55] there it is
[1:13:56] under the same promise
[1:13:58] when he said your seed will possess the
[1:14:00] gate of the enemy that's us
[1:14:03] are we together are we aiming in that
[1:14:04] one
[1:14:05] then take through the um
[1:14:07] then taken through the blood till the
[1:14:09] blood cell we come through the spray of
[1:14:11] blood then by the holy spirit are
[1:14:14] baptized into the this blood cell and we
[1:14:17] have fellowship one with another while
[1:14:19] the blood of jesus christ son of god
[1:14:21] cleanses from all unrighteousness oh my
[1:14:24] there you are that's what we need
[1:14:27] positionally confessed to christ
[1:14:31] through the blood the shed blood then
[1:14:34] positionally we are seated
[1:14:37] we have already passed we are watched by
[1:14:39] the blood but all we need to do now
[1:14:41] right we are now with cross jordan
[1:14:44] we are now entering joshua is leading
[1:14:46] and caleb we are now in
[1:14:48] all what we need to do to take jericho
[1:14:51] is to be positionally pleased the moment
[1:14:54] we go around jericho two times yet
[1:14:56] because you're not full there must be a
[1:14:57] position and arrangement that god has
[1:14:59] said
[1:15:00] we have already we are in
[1:15:03] you are in brothers and sisters there's
[1:15:05] nothing that the enemy is going to do
[1:15:08] nothing and i promise you there's
[1:15:10] nothing
[1:15:11] all what he's doing we just have to
[1:15:13] remind him that listen
[1:15:15] doesn't matter whether you for six
[1:15:17] thousand years
[1:15:18] we are in
[1:15:19] he's inside me
[1:15:21] and i'm inside him
[1:15:23] now you are there for zero
[1:15:26] right you are below me you devil so all
[1:15:29] i need to do he just want to disturb you
[1:15:32] to disturb you not to be positionally
[1:15:34] pleased if you find that that the other
[1:15:37] team
[1:15:38] has scored 10 goals
[1:15:42] 10 goals
[1:15:45] they know they have won
[1:15:47] 10 minutes is left
[1:15:50] they have called 10 goals
[1:15:52] do you think there's a chance for the
[1:15:53] other team
[1:15:56] huh
[1:15:57] do you think there's a chance for the
[1:15:58] other team so the issue is that the
[1:16:01] other team can just frustrate them
[1:16:03] they can just play the ball around and
[1:16:05] just pass the ball to one another
[1:16:06] that's what the devil wants to do the
[1:16:08] devil think that he can frustrate us but
[1:16:10] we actually are the ones to frustrate
[1:16:12] the devil we must become the devil's
[1:16:15] devil
[1:16:17] because we know that we are already 10
[1:16:19] not
[1:16:21] that's our score 10 note
[1:16:24] so all we need to do we just
[1:16:26] keep our positions intact
[1:16:29] pass the ball to one another
[1:16:31] open up the spaces for another the devil
[1:16:33] he cannot he he all he can just blow up
[1:16:38] he can just best
[1:16:39] there's nothing he can do
[1:16:41] that's to be our approach to the devil
[1:16:43] he shouldn't be scaring us as if we are
[1:16:45] not leading goal scorers in this game we
[1:16:47] are leading
[1:16:49] and the time is five minutes left
[1:16:53] how can he win
[1:16:55] and he already got the red card at the
[1:16:56] cross
[1:16:58] some of his players are out
[1:17:00] so you
[1:17:02] play the game like the person who has
[1:17:04] already won
[1:17:06] the game is not over yet but you won
[1:17:09] you are living
[1:17:12] you've got 10 full players
[1:17:14] and you're going to keep up the devil
[1:17:16] has got no keep ideas he has been red
[1:17:17] carted
[1:17:19] and some of his players are injured
[1:17:22] how can he win
[1:17:24] with us leading 10 goals
[1:17:26] sorry i'm not preaching
[1:17:29] i'm trying to demonstrate a point
[1:17:32] right now
[1:17:33] the blood of the lord jesus has already
[1:17:35] done the job we have accepted we have
[1:17:37] been baptized we have been washed we are
[1:17:39] clean we are now just doing what you
[1:17:42] call the finishing touches so let's do
[1:17:45] it well by being within our
[1:17:47] positions
[1:17:49] hallelujah
[1:17:50] let's read more
[1:17:52] sorry tonight i'm just gonna preach by
[1:17:54] means of reading because i realize that
[1:17:57] if i just go on and others lose me so i
[1:17:59] want you to follow me
[1:18:01] but jesus knew that he was there and he
[1:18:04] knew he was in that condition when he
[1:18:06] was questioned he said verily i say unto
[1:18:09] you that son can do nothing in himself
[1:18:12] but what he sees the father doing
[1:18:15] that they'll do with the son likewise
[1:18:18] you see that is that his same position
[1:18:21] today
[1:18:23] what is this thing that when when you
[1:18:25] see the father you only act when you see
[1:18:28] the father
[1:18:29] all our play in this game is all what
[1:18:32] the coach is telling us is there's a
[1:18:34] captain in this game
[1:18:36] and that captain he's got a band
[1:18:38] he's got a captain bent
[1:18:41] with the blood
[1:18:43] that
[1:18:44] that came from calvary that captain is
[1:18:46] the one that coordinates this game he's
[1:18:48] the because he he's the strategist in
[1:18:51] this game he's the ceo
[1:18:53] of this company
[1:18:55] so we are not afraid we are not going to
[1:18:57] make a loss we know we already have a
[1:18:59] profit brother andy we have a profit
[1:19:01] already
[1:19:02] and there's already a deposit an ernest
[1:19:06] deposit has already been put for us so
[1:19:08] he says it that's his same position no
[1:19:11] prophet no one has ever been able to do
[1:19:14] anything outside the sovereignty of god
[1:19:17] god's will that's right
[1:19:20] what god will
[1:19:22] so the point i wanted to bring here is
[1:19:24] that uh with all what we do
[1:19:27] in everything that we do we was always
[1:19:30] here the still small voice
[1:19:32] of our of our lord of our captain in
[1:19:35] this game
[1:19:36] because even the lord jesus took that
[1:19:38] possession position very clearly that is
[1:19:41] why he won
[1:19:42] he said the son will never do anything
[1:19:45] until the father
[1:19:46] say something
[1:19:47] until it is the will of the father are
[1:19:49] we following
[1:19:51] let's just remember one thing brothers
[1:19:52] and sisters let's just remember another
[1:19:55] person right away here or a group of
[1:19:57] people that's israel when israel had to
[1:20:00] put their place themselves in position
[1:20:02] to take the stand for god
[1:20:04] you remember that israel
[1:20:07] will never even be blessed as long as
[1:20:09] they were out of their position
[1:20:11] as long as they were out of the promised
[1:20:13] land god wouldn't bless them
[1:20:16] yes they could think that they are
[1:20:17] prospering they are working hard they
[1:20:19] are doing this when they were in goshen
[1:20:21] when they were in babylon when they were
[1:20:23] well now those god god god is the loving
[1:20:25] god but the real blessing that
[1:20:27] positionally places israel
[1:20:30] was when they were in the promised land
[1:20:33] because they were positionally placed
[1:20:36] that's where god is fulfilling his word
[1:20:39] for them that's why he wanted them to go
[1:20:41] there
[1:20:42] that is why abraham took his wife and
[1:20:44] buried her at macapela what do you call
[1:20:47] the place
[1:20:48] mark pela because abraham understood the
[1:20:51] position of being in the promised land
[1:20:53] he understood it very well and that's
[1:20:55] why me and you today must be be buried
[1:20:58] at macapel
[1:21:02] that's not the same one that's another
[1:21:03] samurai
[1:21:04] and there was coming a dead angel one
[1:21:07] night that was going to take the first
[1:21:10] born every in every house
[1:21:13] he was going to kill the children of
[1:21:14] israel even them if they did not
[1:21:18] positionally arrange themselves
[1:21:20] if there was no blood
[1:21:22] if there was no everything that the lord
[1:21:24] wanted
[1:21:25] had to be done
[1:21:26] otherwise all the first bones were going
[1:21:29] to die
[1:21:30] first bones of cats first bones of dogs
[1:21:33] first bones of humans first bones of all
[1:21:35] the cockroaches you have at home
[1:21:37] everything
[1:21:38] first born was going to die
[1:21:41] so
[1:21:43] they had to come in position
[1:21:46] the children of israel mama sheila isn't
[1:21:48] it they had to come in position
[1:21:50] otherwise there was going to be a
[1:21:51] problem
[1:21:52] but jesus knew
[1:21:54] paragraph was 2 16 but jesus knew from
[1:21:56] the same spoken word oh sorry this one
[1:21:58] is from remembering the lord but jesus
[1:22:00] knew that
[1:22:03] um
[1:22:05] i think i've read this one
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:09] let me move to the next one speaking
[1:22:11] things into existence when you are in
[1:22:14] position that remember earlier and i
[1:22:16] said to you
[1:22:17] it will come to pass that
[1:22:20] you will speak things into existence
[1:22:22] that you will say things in your life
[1:22:25] and they will happen
[1:22:27] simply because you took your position
[1:22:29] let's listen to the men of god in the
[1:22:31] spoken word investment he says and we
[1:22:33] have the opportunity we are invited to
[1:22:35] receive this christ that that god could
[1:22:38] take you and position you in his way in
[1:22:40] such a place till when you speak
[1:22:44] the things that the things that that's
[1:22:47] foresaw and foretold and so forth could
[1:22:49] work right through you every time
[1:22:52] exactly right never fails cannot fail
[1:22:55] simply because you took your position
[1:22:57] simply because you are placed
[1:22:59] positionally you will see things that
[1:23:00] are still coming you'll see things that
[1:23:02] you you'll foresee things and speak
[1:23:05] your things into existence it's all
[1:23:08] about the position that we need to to
[1:23:11] have and maintain it on a daily basis
[1:23:14] are we together i'm almost finishing
[1:23:17] today i won't take long and we have the
[1:23:19] opportunity so that's our opportunity
[1:23:21] tonight
[1:23:22] now let's let's let's let's look at that
[1:23:24] i want us to talk about to read the
[1:23:26] scripture john 20
[1:23:28] verse 19.
[1:23:31] let's read john 20 verse 19
[1:23:35] i think with the the brothers just leave
[1:23:38] the screen there to allow everyone to
[1:23:40] open their bible
[1:23:43] to give each one an opportunity to read
[1:23:45] the bible
[1:23:46] john 20
[1:23:47] verse 19.
[1:23:51] and then
[1:23:53] from this i mean john 20 verse 19 to 23
[1:23:56] right he says here are we are we there
[1:24:02] then the same the same day at evening
[1:24:06] being this is now after the resurrection
[1:24:09] he rose up then he then the same day
[1:24:11] remember he said it is finished
[1:24:14] at the beginning remember jesus took his
[1:24:16] position at the cross that is why he you
[1:24:18] could have you could say the words it is
[1:24:21] finished now listen to it is finished
[1:24:24] now this is what is finished he says now
[1:24:26] he's appearing to them now
[1:24:29] then the same day at evening being the
[1:24:31] first day of the week when the doors
[1:24:33] were shut
[1:24:35] where the disciples were assembled for
[1:24:37] fear of jews came jesus and stood in the
[1:24:40] midst and said unto them peace
[1:24:43] be unto you
[1:24:46] that's the man who says it is finished
[1:24:47] as if they
[1:24:49] they hate me they also write that peace
[1:24:51] be unto you in red
[1:24:52] you know they understand my language of
[1:24:54] wanting to build something that's what
[1:24:56] the lord said peace be unto you and when
[1:24:58] he had said so
[1:25:00] he showed unto them his hands and his
[1:25:03] side
[1:25:04] then
[1:25:04] where the disciples glad when they saw
[1:25:08] the lord
[1:25:09] then said jesus to them again peace be
[1:25:12] unto you as my father has sent me
[1:25:16] my part is finished now as my father
[1:25:18] sent me even so send i
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:23] he's pleasing them
[1:25:26] are you hearing he's positionally
[1:25:28] setting them up
[1:25:30] verse 22
[1:25:31] and he had he had said this he breathed
[1:25:35] on them and said unto them
[1:25:38] receive ye the holy ghost
[1:25:42] and he said in verse 23 whosoever seen
[1:25:44] he remit they are remitted unto them and
[1:25:48] so ever since he returned they are
[1:25:50] retained what a power
[1:25:53] what the position
[1:25:55] he was telling them this is your from
[1:25:57] now on i'm done i'm done my part but i'm
[1:26:00] gonna be with you but i'm giving you
[1:26:02] this
[1:26:03] authority
[1:26:04] because position is authority will come
[1:26:06] to realize that positions determines
[1:26:09] your authority
[1:26:13] let's look at that let's look at just
[1:26:15] the first one position
[1:26:18] for possession let's think of the
[1:26:20] children of israel
[1:26:21] when they were in the promised land if
[1:26:23] they missed their position the other
[1:26:25] group that went with joshua and caleb
[1:26:27] they missed it
[1:26:28] that is why they could not gain
[1:26:31] their possession had it not been by the
[1:26:32] grace of god had it not been for joshua
[1:26:35] and caleb they were going to miss the
[1:26:36] promised land as long as israel was out
[1:26:39] of position
[1:26:41] they wouldn't get
[1:26:42] their position
[1:26:45] king david killing goliath or joshua and
[1:26:47] caleb
[1:26:48] position his victory
[1:26:50] position gives you your victory
[1:26:52] you get your position you get your
[1:26:54] victory you lose your position you lose
[1:26:57] your victory
[1:26:59] you lose it i don't know about somebody
[1:27:01] who loses his position he's not in his
[1:27:04] position but he's still victorious
[1:27:07] i'm yet to see that kind of a person
[1:27:10] and the position brings your healing
[1:27:13] remember he said when you are in
[1:27:14] position anything you can see
[1:27:18] anything even the things that are not of
[1:27:20] present you can tell us that tomorrow
[1:27:24] nine o'clock
[1:27:28] you'll someone will call you for a job
[1:27:30] interview and you are going to get that
[1:27:31] job
[1:27:32] because you are in position
[1:27:34] you you you are past the level you can
[1:27:36] see what is going to happen you are in
[1:27:38] position
[1:27:40] god is using you for your position and i
[1:27:42] must not want to be like you no no i
[1:27:45] must be in my
[1:27:47] position
[1:27:49] isn't it okay that's how what i must be
[1:27:51] is that so so and we see there that
[1:27:54] position
[1:27:55] for deliverance
[1:28:00] basically the list goes on and on and on
[1:28:04] and on i cannot exhaust the list for how
[1:28:07] important
[1:28:09] my position in the body
[1:28:12] my position in the family my position at
[1:28:15] work
[1:28:16] my position anywhere
[1:28:18] even when i walk on the road i must be
[1:28:20] in my position
[1:28:22] to understand that the position is not
[1:28:24] just a title
[1:28:26] to be in position no no no no there's so
[1:28:29] much built in the position
[1:28:32] just like there's so much built in the
[1:28:34] position of this body of the lord jesus
[1:28:37] christ there is so much build in them
[1:28:39] are we together
[1:28:41] position for peace
[1:28:43] israel have made of many years of peace
[1:28:47] yet they were led by a man of war called
[1:28:49] gideon the bible did they say for for
[1:28:51] more than 40 years if i'm not mistaken
[1:28:53] there was peace in the land because they
[1:28:56] were in position
[1:28:58] they were positionally placed
[1:29:01] and there was peace and not only gideon
[1:29:03] but many other kings right
[1:29:05] and
[1:29:06] position for power over satan
[1:29:12] i like that one that that is that is you
[1:29:15] get your power when you are within your
[1:29:17] position to overcome your enemy
[1:29:20] to tell to put your enemy in his
[1:29:22] position
[1:29:24] your position will enable you to place
[1:29:26] your enemy in his position
[1:29:28] right and intel give you your possession
[1:29:31] that's what this position is all about
[1:29:33] the apostle paul brother branham
[1:29:36] you must look at his life there were
[1:29:38] times when he he certain things
[1:29:41] yesterday as a human being he also made
[1:29:43] mistakes
[1:29:45] and the angel of the lord disappeared
[1:29:47] from him
[1:29:49] huh the angel of the lord was not there
[1:29:51] and he had to come back to his position
[1:29:55] in his heart in his life everything
[1:29:59] and then the angel of the lord appears
[1:30:00] again
[1:30:02] so
[1:30:03] the same thing must happen to me and you
[1:30:05] brothers and sisters if we we miss
[1:30:08] as we walk along the line we have to go
[1:30:10] back and see god to be brought back to
[1:30:12] the position of his weight
[1:30:14] so that the angel the sensitivity of the
[1:30:16] spirit
[1:30:18] he says the prophet in one spoken word
[1:30:20] if you offend the holy spirit he's so
[1:30:22] sensitive
[1:30:25] and he he just flies
[1:30:28] and stan stand there by the pool
[1:30:33] and then you are wondering why things
[1:30:35] happen and then you come to your senses
[1:30:37] by the grace of god and you see god you
[1:30:40] see god and he flies
[1:30:42] comes back to take his position in you
[1:30:45] in me
[1:30:47] that's what that's how sensitive he is
[1:30:49] so sensitive that a little child can run
[1:30:52] here
[1:30:53] and disturb the presence of the holy
[1:30:55] spirit
[1:30:56] i'm not saying we mustn't run i'm just
[1:30:57] trying to show you that the one that we
[1:31:00] save we need to understand his presence
[1:31:02] to be sensitive to his presence to know
[1:31:04] how he operates to dance in the spirit
[1:31:07] but in position
[1:31:09] are we together
[1:31:11] position for for authority i even ran
[1:31:14] out of examples there's so much
[1:31:17] about your position
[1:31:19] all these people that you see on earth
[1:31:21] doing all different things they lost
[1:31:23] their position
[1:31:26] they lost it that is why i i try to
[1:31:29] speak at least to someone once a day
[1:31:31] this one person
[1:31:33] just about something to do with god and
[1:31:35] i've come to know to realize that ah
[1:31:37] people have lost their position
[1:31:39] people don't know who they are anymore i
[1:31:42] said to this lady today i say my
[1:31:45] my friend
[1:31:46] um
[1:31:48] i have to go now the train is leaving me
[1:31:50] because i'm ministering tonight i'm
[1:31:52] preaching
[1:31:53] he said oh
[1:31:56] i said do you go to church he said no
[1:31:59] and you know what from that point he was
[1:32:00] not interested i thought i'll get to a
[1:32:02] point where i'll say can i give you the
[1:32:04] link no i didn't get that chance
[1:32:06] because people have lost their position
[1:32:08] it's our duty to to bring the appetite
[1:32:13] back
[1:32:14] it is our job the song that brother
[1:32:16] isaac wrote about harvesting the
[1:32:18] harvesters are few now
[1:32:21] we need to help
[1:32:23] to bring this dying world and give them
[1:32:26] an opportunity
[1:32:28] about what they have lost
[1:32:30] many of them are our brothers and
[1:32:31] sisters
[1:32:33] are we together many of them but they
[1:32:35] don't know yet and even us we don't know
[1:32:38] but how will we know if we don't tell
[1:32:40] them
[1:32:41] how will we know if we don't just cut it
[1:32:44] man
[1:32:45] just say it hey we are going to church
[1:32:48] tonight can you come with
[1:32:51] have you have you have you made your
[1:32:53] life right with the lord are you ready
[1:32:54] to meet god
[1:32:56] just questions like that are you just
[1:32:58] out of the blue then until someone just
[1:33:00] what's that what did you say no i was
[1:33:02] just asking you are you ready to meet
[1:33:05] the lord
[1:33:06] he says no i don't i don't know about
[1:33:08] that what is that is it a church thing
[1:33:10] say no no it's not a church
[1:33:14] that's how they ask people have lost so
[1:33:17] it is
[1:33:18] we let's not waste the pearls that the
[1:33:20] lord left with us
[1:33:22] let's invest them in people's life just
[1:33:24] to tell someone
[1:33:26] ah even if they start labeling you
[1:33:29] they still start labeling you
[1:33:32] that hey that's a fanatic
[1:33:34] but we must come to that point but out
[1:33:37] of those that are labeling you there are
[1:33:39] those that are going to come
[1:33:41] because you have given them you have
[1:33:42] afforded them an opportunity you have
[1:33:45] spoken life
[1:33:47] in their lives
[1:33:48] you have given it to them just one
[1:33:50] person a day that you have never spoken
[1:33:53] or you have never met
[1:33:54] hello god bless you
[1:33:56] huh do you know what that means
[1:33:59] in in the former get pushed in the
[1:34:01] trolley she bums you somebody bump you
[1:34:03] or you bump somebody

[1:34:14] you know that person can say what does
[1:34:15] that mean
[1:34:16] that can be a lifeline for someone
[1:34:20] to say
[1:34:21] see you there and the lord can just put
[1:34:23] happen to put your cars together at the
[1:34:25] parking so that when you come out you
[1:34:27] say sorry man you bumped me but you said
[1:34:29] something very strange that can be the
[1:34:31] door
[1:34:32] for that man and that woman to get
[1:34:34] eternal life to get eternal life my
[1:34:36] brother my sister not to go to hell that
[1:34:39] can be the opportunity that can be the
[1:34:41] chance
[1:34:42] so let's not waste those kind of
[1:34:43] opportunities let's be in our position
[1:34:46] let's be always in season
[1:34:49] and out of season
[1:34:51] simple things
[1:34:53] i like to verbalize things
[1:34:56] i'll that's how i'm made i like to
[1:34:57] verbalize things until yesterday i told
[1:35:01] that guy remember i gave you a testimony
[1:35:03] of the guy who fell at my work and he
[1:35:05] was having a demon disturbing him and
[1:35:07] wanting to kill him and i saw a demon
[1:35:09] there
[1:35:11] and
[1:35:12] when everybody was running to get a
[1:35:14] pillow to help him to do this i said
[1:35:16] lord what can i do
[1:35:18] something said pray
[1:35:20] i just pray loud
[1:35:21] [Laughter]
[1:35:23] my boss came to me and said
[1:35:25] hey thanks for that
[1:35:29] i said oh pl pleasure pleasure pleasure
[1:35:33] i said i thought i thought nobody helped
[1:35:35] me but i was praying loudly trying to
[1:35:37] cast this demon because i saw that he
[1:35:39] wants to kill this man before he can
[1:35:41] receive christ
[1:35:42] so that was then yesterday the lord made
[1:35:44] an opportunity because i went to the
[1:35:46] office
[1:35:48] i went out for tea late afternoon tea
[1:35:51] i'm finished now i'm just giving this
[1:35:52] little testimony then we are done
[1:35:54] then then i see i can't say his name i
[1:35:58] see him passing and then it i just
[1:36:00] happened to be alone on the couches and
[1:36:02] he was just grabbing his jacket on the
[1:36:04] hangers i said hey mate how are you hey
[1:36:06] man you know that day when you had that
[1:36:08] thing of it he said oh the seizure i
[1:36:10] said yes you know it stuck with me man
[1:36:13] he said oh i said yeah and you know i
[1:36:15] prayed for you
[1:36:17] hey and i saw you i sustaining red i
[1:36:20] said yeah you know i prayed for you that
[1:36:22] day and you know what i believe that god
[1:36:24] can remove that thing from you
[1:36:26] any me and sorry
[1:36:29] me and you can believe
[1:36:32] we can believe and that thing can go
[1:36:34] away

[1:36:37] he said all he could say was that thank
[1:36:38] you so much mate
[1:36:40] thank you
[1:36:41] because i i something spoke to me that
[1:36:44] that person i must pray for him and i
[1:36:46] must tell him about jesus that this
[1:36:48] thing is not his
[1:36:50] that the demon of seizure can go away i
[1:36:53] said to him if you believe

[1:36:59] me to believe together that that thing

[1:37:08] you know god
[1:37:09] he's the high priest
[1:37:11] of our confession
[1:37:14] and he is touched
[1:37:16] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:37:19] you know the pains that people feel
[1:37:21] that they go through we must not be
[1:37:24] insensitive
[1:37:25] people are going through pain

[1:37:30] the lord brings them to us for a purpose
[1:37:33] can i just show you one more time
[1:37:36] there are some people that you are
[1:37:37] meeting them for the first time as you
[1:37:39] walk into town or anywhere you are
[1:37:41] meeting them in town as you walk past

[1:37:45] life in this life
[1:37:47] and you have seen them that's it you
[1:37:49] only have two seconds
[1:37:51] to meet a person in life that's it
[1:37:55] there'll come a point where they think
[1:37:56] that we are mad we just stand in the
[1:37:58] middle of upper heart and say brothers
[1:38:00] and sisters i greet you all in the name

[1:38:14] so that we can bring opportunity of
[1:38:17] eternal life to people and bring our
[1:38:20] rapture closer
[1:38:21] to go home the more we are comfortable
[1:38:24] the more we are fussy the more we are
[1:38:28] easy
[1:38:30] the more we delay our goal the more we
[1:38:32] give the enemy a position
[1:38:37] sorry brothers and sisters i just mean
[1:38:38] to encourage you
[1:38:40] that let's break the spirit
