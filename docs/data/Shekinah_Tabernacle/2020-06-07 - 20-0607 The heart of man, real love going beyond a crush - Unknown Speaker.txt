they said opportunity but in through that all the you know Satan also tries to not get it happen but um so my auntie is going back on Tuesday she the Lord provided a flight for her back home and with everything going so there's a flight from Brisbane to South Africa but she needs to get to Brisbane and um so it's more her her taste him anybody it just shout it was yeah it was just amazing how the Lord was doing all of it and so she we were looking for flights and there was no flights from Auckland to Brisbane and we were really praying or was also praying that the Lord would give her the most direct flight back home because there was other flights but it's 60 hour flights and it's just too long you know um the Lord provides the most direct flight Auckland Brisbane Brisbane home and so we had to book a ticket from Auckland Brisbane and first there was no tickets and then the next morning she got us on a whatsapp group and I said there is a ticket is tickets so we booked but it was a lot of money and so it was about nine hundred dollars just from Auckland to Brisbane and so we booked it and the next morning there was tickets again but for more than half the price for only about $400 enim I said no that's not right so I Chantal was there there's more that morning and I said that's not right said let's pray let's pray because the Lord can provide that that I can make a plan that she doesn't have to buy that much because she already has to buy that much and I don't want it to buy that much and so that was also why in the beginning one of my you know I'm backtracking but think that when there is a flights that's not that much money for and that the Lord would provide that as well and so long story short arrow once enter email to a New Zealand they were so wats a group he's saying what's up to them and we were at Sony Amory splice and we were just talking about it and the tickets and I just said but I'm believing the Lord will provide I'm standing on that and I'm believing and I also was saying that the text came through that everyone sinned and said they will be happily if we're ebook they will happily refund that whole nine hundred and she can read book at a cheaper fly for four hundred I'm saying that is the Lord we serving there is our God praising Amen god bless you I just could not help it you know I just wanted to give the Lord all the glory in the own email but I don't have much but this morning the word of the Lord came to me you know I couldn't sleep last night in and I couldn't understand what is the problem and even up to now I don't know why couldn't I sleep in I was talking to my wife and we think of different things and but I don't know and I just woke up quite alien I started true to pray and just to speak to the Lord in and when I opened my Bible you know the Lord just sent me to this verse that I cannot read the whole chapter but just a few verses but I believe is the word of God that came to me you know not only to me but to me and God's people amen in that one is in Isaiah Isaiah 51 he came so wonderfully to me he says it was just like I was reading something that I never read before amen verse 3 for the Lord shall comfort Zion he will comfort all he waste places and he will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the Garden of the Lord joy and gladness shall be found there in Thanksgiving in the voice of the melody in verse 6 we say lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like command and they that dwell therein shall die in in that manner but my salvation shall be forever and my righteousness shall not be abolished how can unto me ye that know righteousness the people in wise heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revealing zhh first 10 are down not in which had dried the sea about not in which had dried the sea the waters of the great deep that had made the test of the sea a way of the ransom to pass Esther I even I am that comforted you who allow that thou shouldn't be afraid of men that shall die and in other wise he says who are you that you can be afraid to the to the people that can die you know and and and the son of men we shall shall be made as grass why should you be afraid and forget us and forget us the Lord that die maker that had stretches fought the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and it's in fear continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where and wherein is the first the fury of the oppressor but I am THE LORD thy God that's verse 15 but I am the Lord our God that divided the sea whose whose Amen whose waves fraud the Lord of Hosts is his name um I just wanted to give a testimony guys we lift the wellington area about 30 years ago and there was no one to fellowship was down here it was just we got told that Wellington was spiritually did that it was all prayed out and so to look around and see all you guys down here and what the Lord's doing down here is just absolutely it's really amazing just do many Mikes a anyone else brother James I love this eh I wasn't actually gonna planning on sharing this but since we're doing shearing I've been spending at a time with unbelievers just with fellowship with mountain biking and things and I sort of believe that there's no you know these these situations don't happen for no reason you know where the bride and we're there to be approachable on different things but this is maybe more a prayer acquiesce but a guy that I was riding with a little while ago he's probably in his early twenties and he's had a real rough upbringing with his dad's a gang president of a gang and he had bought himself like a ten thousand dollar mountain bike really flash run and now he's getting back into the drugs and he was offering his bike around to people and willing to take 500 bucks for it just so he could get us next hurt him you know I just really felt on my heart when I heard it yesterday just to pray for him and just say Lord just he's right at that point you know where he could just go and he'll never come back and I just really felt to pray from his name was Maddie and so yeah I just have you filled on your heart to pray for him just the Lord would keep them because we're there for a reason you know we don't have these interactions for no reason and the law can place me there in that situation just don't succeed allworthy once upon a time we if we carried on the way that we were

Jesus Christ then we ask Lord amen amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank you musicians amen great to have everyone here I mean great to have a man Simon and Julie hey god bless you amen praise the Lord so it's wonderful to be in his presence isn't it I mean let's go to the book of first kings and this is um this may be a bit different but that's alright God's in the different first Kings in 21 and I've got a it's on the slides which should be in the queue yeah yeah and then we're gonna go to Hebrews chapter 4 I mean when everyone's there or looking at the screen just say I mean I mean God's in control I mean we shouldn't we shouldn't worry I mean first Kings 21 and we're gonna read down to I believe it's it's verse 8 here first Kings 21 and verse 1 then it came to pass that after these things their neighbor off the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of Samaria in ahab spake unto neighbors saying give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and I will give it thee for a bit of an yard then it or if it seemed good to thee I will give thee the worth of it and money and they both said to Ahab the Lord forbid at me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the words which they both the her light had spoken to him for he had said I'll not give thee the inheritance of my father's and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would not eat no bread so he had an adult tantrum now I've got your attention good but G but G's Abell his wife came to him and said and unto him why as thy spirit so said that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her because i spake at an a both the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else effort please say I'll give thee another vineyard for it and he answered and when he answered I will not give it thee I will not give thee my vineyard and jitan Jezebel his wife said unto Him thus thou now govern the kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thy heart be merry I'll give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite amen and then we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 4 I'm gonna read some familiar Scripture here Hebrews 4 and 12 I think it's Hebrews 4:12 he's here I'm gonna read down to to verse 16 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword dividing only piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and tints of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in a sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of whom which whom we have to do you can't hide nothing that's basically the sum total you can't hide nothing even your your your objectives your motives you know you can pull the wool over everyone's eyes but not God seeing then that we have a great high priest with that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the fee of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need I mean may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning I wonder um what do we got next oh yes okay so I want to continue on I think a couple of services guys talk about the heart so I want to continue on talking about the heart of man now we we start here with with a hab and I said he had an adult tantrum hit and and what I want to talk about this morning is I want to talk about real love this is my title this may see me but we may go way up this way there will come way back here and we'll end up hopefully where we want to end up but I want to talk about real love and going beyond a crush now now when I use the term crush I'm not talking just two to two teenagers to me adults to because the society we live in has actually been engineered that people actually don't emotionally mature beyond a teenager this is actually how society's been built and so we want to look into this because you know as I say there's not just for teenagers for adults because there's been studies done that's actually proven it's not by I don't know how to blank that here we'll leave it up there you know it's been studies done not by Christians at all proving that actually the millennial generation which is my generation and and and the ones after us actually society especially when it comes to men and but same with woman too as as people physically become a man but emotionally there's still boys and it's actually based on you know your the whole culture of gaming and and the internet and entertainment and everything it actually emotionally stunts people and what happens is you end up like Ahab because here was a hab he was king right but then he had a crush he had a desire I want that guy's vineyard I want that one and so he had a desire that he wanted it but because it was against the Word of God and they both said no you can't have it what did he do he threw it at all tantrum he went in here I love reading this story to my girls in the picture bubble cuz you know I have zero know Jesus about walks and he's easy he's got his face against the wall and lying on his beard and they're just they're not eating us he she comes in honey what's wrong and he goes that's what he's basically doing it's ridiculous but this is what the guy did why because emotionally he was still a boy he was a king but emotionally he was a boy he couldn't handle someone saying no oh but I wanna you know he's like having a fuss and the problem is but you see is because what happens is something will always fill the void member he was meant to be king and if someone is not in their place something will fill that void so what filled the boy boy Jezebel filled the void she said I'll take care of this and she wrote letters and you know there's a conspiracy and they had named both killed under false charges and then na had got the got the got the vineyard but if he was a godly King this would never have happened and he would never have been killed in battle and all those things so he brought judgment upon himself because emotionally he was still a boy he threw an adult tantrum you know adult Tantrums they're just as bad as the kids you're facedown screaming on the ground they may look more control but the same same thing we don't want to grow up and just be throwing out old Tantrums all the day long because we got handle things anyway so you know see so the Word of God now we need to see the devil what he does is he comes up next to us and starts whispering in our ears and if we begin to agree with him he will take our spirits you'll take our fictions our reasoning our imagination our conscience our memory and he'll anoint it to such a degree that will believe his lie above the facts so we don't want to get you know you know I was singing do we have weight can we have that backup I always um I'm so bad with power would anyway Jeremiah 10:23 but but we're gonna stumble through this but I trust that you know it'll it'll help us you know because it's not just as I say teenagers that go through crushes and things it's adults why do you think men leave their wives and they go marry this one they do have midlife crises and things why because they're emotional they've gone from just a crush to a crush and there's no anchoring real love in their lives I'm innocent but it's the same thing in you know you know and Christians and people are caught up in this this ministry then this ministry then this ministry but you know and they just keep wandering from one thing to another because it sounds good but if their heart is ever anchored in the Word of God that's like real love it stays it's got holding power they won't be swayed to nothing else they found the real thing so Jeremiah here says Oh Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself it is not a man that walketh to direct the steps this is Jeremiah talking now it's amazing the you know it's amazing Jeremiah and and this is very applicable to our day because before Jeremiah was there we know it was now forgive me if I get it wrong but I did Joe I'm Josiah I think it's King Josiah you know he he was a godly King and nnn he saw the house of God was falling down and he said we've got to repair this thing we're gonna repair it and then as they were appearing at they find the Word of God hidden hidden somewhere now to me that's crazy but you know the word has been left somewhere just discarded and then now when the temples being rebuilt they find the word then they begin to read the law and they begin to realize guys we're toast because we've done everything that Moses said if you do that if you follow the gods of the heathen if you do all these things you're gonna be taken out the land and they're reading this saying wigs we're in dire straights what are we gonna do about this and they and they and they read it to the king and you know he was repenting to then they went to the prophetess a hood longer namers have him pronounced a rope and God said this will happen but not in the days of King Josiah so now here comes Jeremiah and now what-what was prophesied before him has to come to pass and he is living in an hour where it's going to come to pass he's already had the vision that the Babylonians gonna come down and destroy Jerusalem he knows that it's that that it's over but yet he has to stand there and preach against the wrong to try and try and bring the people back to the Word of God and his world was falling apart but he's got to stand there in there that world falling apart and it's the same thing today you know have you ever put yourself in a Bible character like that how could someone could stand in an unstable world but yet stay true to their Commission we are we are walking in those same steps today this world I think I think brother John Andy's seen it how this world is I think he preached on balance or something this is an Easter or sometime you know this world is very unbalanced incredibly unbalanced and we're gonna be very careful we don't get caught in the unbalancing because this world is falling apart and unfortunately we can't stop it now he says here in leadership but now who lead you see if you can come to a realization that is not within yourself to direct your steps you know this this may sound ridiculous but this was me you know I wanted to become a doctor and you know but do you know why it is so so that it sounds like a good thing to do become a doctor you know why I wanted to become a doctor because when I was young I thought surgery TV shows was cool and I used to watch a comedy series called scrubs and I thought and that gave me the motivation to be a doctor yeah oh dear but the thing is you you're you can be so caught up in something and it's not reality it's just a fantasy world and you know it can be seen so I was like math of what a ridiculous fellow but that's how I was you mean what do you mean you get caught up in a and a TV show and you wanna you know make your whole life to do this yeah people do it people do it and a lot more vain things than being a doctor help us God keep us keep our keep our spirits right keep us keep us on the middle of the road you know I don't say there's a joke but you ought to say it I can't understand one side to be caught up in something at all want to do this and you know it's not within us to direct our steps if you just come to that realization Lord that's not actually in me to direct master I need something to direct me and if you have the Word of God this message to direct you you'll come out right I mean but if you don't have it you'll be teetering around like the rest of the world he says but now who leads you that's the question now now we're all led by something tonight I'll say this morning we have to be we're led now this world as I see this falling apart now brother Brown and I just I just picked us out of condemnation by representation remember in 1933 heared though what we call the seven major visions and the last one is what I've got underlined but his autumn automobiles will continue to get like egg-shaped finally they'll build one that won't need a steering wheel oh cool I can go probably buy that it's there we have the technology yep they've got it now it will be controlled by some other power then I see in the United States is one smouldering burnt over place it will be near the end this is what he said the others have come to pass this has to happen but I'll say this that it's like this will be a combination a culmination of multiple events they won't be in the height of their strength of moral authority and and power and then suddenly nickman Utley nothing rome wasn't built in a day and it wasn't destroyed in a day just like America they won't be destroyed in one day so the insanity that you see going on over there now is actually marching towards that it's all wrong what's going on that that poor man that was murdered by the police that was murder that was wrong that was absolutely wrong right you know but it's just it's just a symptom of that that it's marching just like Jeremiah he saw it there marching towards destruction and didn't matter what they what he said what he tried to do God vindicated as his minister everything they said now we're gonna go this way anyway and it's the same thing with America we can't stop it happening but we can't get caught up in it why because a spirit is manifesting to cause division see ya you know the old old saying divide and conquer where does that come from that's from the devil how does the house are you're a strong if it's divided it will fall right everyone's got their motive and objective for doing what they're doing but it's just a place the house is divided but we can't be caught up in the division right we have to actually say well unfortunately this has to be this way but we have a way out of here right and that's honestly this is this is really should be our main focus the ship is sinking get everyone we can on the lifeboat right it's like the Titanic slowly going down get everyone on the lifeboat we're going to get out of here oh no we can we can pump the water out no no you can't pump the water out the boats gonna sink right oh we can fix this world brother Bram said that that America could have an Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington and every county and every state and it still wouldn't help it and here was the George Washington Muir he was the first president yo you're the other signed the Declaration of Independence every man created equal all those things in Abraham Lincoln they mean freed the slaves you know you know he's here at the slave market in Louisiana saw those slaves being sold and he said even if it costs my life I'll hurt that thing hallelujah and he did it I meant you can have those kind of me and that kind of caliber in every state every county every state and it would still sink so that's why unfortunate going to save and get on the boat get on the gospel life ship how their because we're because unfortunately this world is sinking amen it doesn't mean where I'm not happy with what's going on I'm not praise the Lord Amen we're getting closer not only this I you know when I saw what's going on I was actually crying about it such a great nation and brother am said if they just accepted the gift of the Holy Ghost they would have had a millennium if the nation just accepted Christ when he was manifesting himself and his power all through the United States and Canada all the way through their multiple ministry signs and healings and wonders and things of faith he said if they just accepted the Holy Ghost they would have had a millennium just like just like Solomon's gift was except the buyers rather it's like they had a millennium in that day they had peace but it's the same thing with us if we just accept the gift of the Holy Ghost in this hour I mean you'll have a like a millennium in your in your heart hallelujah but unfortunately to reject that means chaos and they've got chaos they have ripped now they're sowing what they reaped and this country will do the same thing when I were an island no no this world is connected went on an island somewhere actually or was up it was actually Christine's um uncle uncle Peter said yo Switzerland as an island I thought no it's not it's connected with Europe now he meant that as in terms of like it's separate from everything else not not gia you know you're the geography of the place well no it's all in to open like this we're all in to open with everything else hey yeah if the house is on fire we're gonna burn down with it that's why we're going to stay level in an unlevel world you know the problem you know we had it was when the youth came up from Taranaki and stuff I was in a car with brother Kanan and these other brothers we're driving out to what's that cafe there by the airport we're into whatever that's called chocolate fish it was good anyway we're driving there and these two brothers are talking about different political systems and which one's better and how this one were working and in theory sure but the problem is you're dealing with unconverted fallen man so nothing's gonna work because this unconverted fallen man that devil can work through and selfish motives couldn't you know so you know theories all very well but your practicality oh so the greater the house the greater the destruction of the house you know so you can see why Jeremiah's called the weeping prophet tried to swing the people back but because it was prophesied it had to happen it happened anywho brother baron would say this and in the simona church age speaking about ahab speaking about anyone like going back to that he says why does he stand by our character and so on the reason is in romans 8 17 to 18 and if children then is is of God joint heirs with Christ if so be we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with them we cannot reign with them we have to suffer to reign the reason is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory it's not a gift doesn't just get given to you here have have got the character no no it's a victory well what's the thing you've got to overcome your own selfish first birth amen I mean we have to character as a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule a man just like just like Ahab he had no character so I was a satanic leadership over the nation through through a adult tantrum and as I see it society you say that's a big statement but it's true Society has been engineered to make us emotionally immature doesn't matter what age we are why can't we shout and rejoice we may get there but you know I was I was thinking a lot about what what brother John Andes were saying on over Easter time you know we can we can shout we can rejoice about abstract things but this message comes down to our everyday life that comes down to the the the the inner part of us you know it's just like when the first Exodus was was pronounced there and you're in Egypt the you know the token wasn't applied to win yo when Moses went out and did all the plays and did all the great outward things and you know the Nile turning to blood and the Flies and the frogs and the whatever it was the token came into the family it was applied to the house riders applied to the ER and you know the inner inner family life there's where the blood was really applied to it wasn't the outward bits it was in the in the inward bits that's why this message showed to me it's got to get to our address you know if it's just up here and you know thunders and and seals and you know if those things don't come down here it's just theory but if that comes down here it'll be a reality amen so you know that's why this is just where I'm going so can we drive now this is now this is just what came to me now though this is so to me the message has got to be everyday life how does it apply to me now this photo is as the Allied fighter command during world war ii during the battle of britain so so so here they are and they're armed you know this is this is the English coast here I think this is the you know this is the fringes the English Channel in there and they're talking about different fighters and you know where the bases are and moving the moving the fighters around and this is the missions they've got to do and stuff this is the Allied command you know now it's very easy to just talk about you know on on that kind of level you know we'll have the space here this radar here and hallelujah and this is going to happen and you know but what if you're a pilot and all you know is this but now I say okay okay suit up we're gonna go fight the Nazis and you're gonna drive one of these this is a Supermarine Spitfire oh but it was wonderful talking about it here but yeah and it's always something with something's like a far-off we can rejoice so we can say glory and hallelujah but then when it comes on home as though all this gets a bit personal and I prayed the would it just be personal I want to be a person I don't want to you know I don't want to look at a bunch of glazed over eyes and faces and you know he'll be done at about that time and we'll go out and what's for lunch and you know don't miss your blessing don't miss what God God could change your life now so we don't want our we want to be coming close a Lord speak to my heart today change my you know change my ways of thinking in my heart and so it's easy to do that right but then you go okay today you're gonna get in that and that's the cockpit now it's easier to say hallelujah there it gets a bit daunting Dawn daunting there right then but wait but when you jump in there oh boy where do you put the key you know daddy okay but the thing is if you know how this works then that's easy and that's real easy right that's actually the least of your worries amen so you know it's the same thing with the Word of God we're going to know how the devil works brother em scissors like it's like a boxer you know trains against their opponent and you see good sports teams they take footage of their opponents and they study they have a team of coaches and they study different players and how they act on the field and their different moves and all their even the subconscious things that players will do they will study it down to the nth degree and that's how they win right it's not the 90 minutes on the field that you win it's actually the preparation beforehand amen and it's the same thing even even with us if we don't know what our opponent does well say oh we're going at a rapture then what and we're on the ground or what happened there and we get caught up in some emotion or some fantasy like I did becoming a doctor you know because I watch the TV show oh boy I did know this is true the sex I'm not making this up this was me you know and we'll get caught up in some fantasy world and the devil's just taking us down some garden path and we'll end up with disappointment but if we know what he's doing then we can jump in the cockpit we can shoot him down do a victory lap and land you know we can we can do our fighter mission then we're done I mean the you know you're the word says in Psalms 119 100 105 how sweet of our words I don't think this is here know how how sweet of our words under the under my taste yes we do that honey to my mouth through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we need light in this day it's dark it's real dark you know we you know I was at Friday night you know the strokes came over and and and by the time they called me Cosway and home it was foggy then you see this valley manic through foggy and without lights that's just pea soup and you'll you'll hit something even though you may think I know the road and how it turns and you know but if you don't know where the road is because of the lights you'll crash into something that's like this you may say oh yeah I know the way I'm going it's all sorted out yeah but without the light of the word to shine on your path you're just you're just driving because of a knowledge as opposed to a reality amen so we want to see the message as I said it's got to come down to where we live if it doesn't then there's nothing more than theory or theology or a philosophy or an exchange of conceptual ideas who wants that today I'm glad every but no one said Amen I mean you know you know like the scripture says in 2nd Timothy 4 and 3 it says for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears the Internet makes it very very easily to do you don't have to travel you can just log in and keep yourself teachers because you want to hear something new but then how does it come down to your everyday life you know Paul would go to Athens and now nothing against the Athenians or or the Greeks in any way but but but the culture of Athens in that day was everyone just sat around waiting to hear something new it says in acts 17 19 to 21 and they took him taking Paul and brought him unto Aereo faggus however he say his name saying may we know what this new dot may may we know what this new doctrine we're of our speakers is for there bring a certain strange things to our ears that we would know therefore what these things mean for all the Athenians and strangers which were and which were there spent their time and nothing else but either to tell or to hear something new and that's how we can even become I want to hear something new and sure these may be new things to hear but you know if we're just chasing after something that's a little bit different and they just sit around doing this where was the everyday life where was the actual Christianity in motion I'll put it that way you know so so we don't want to just become that way I mean but but we wanted to actually affect our character affect our everyday life you know this word we hear will mold us and shape us that you know will people will see Jesus don't we want that now amen now as I said my subject today is real love going beyond the crush now the definition for the word crush this is just mr. Google Toby so says a brief but intense infatuation for someone especially someone unobtainable that's what a crush is a brief intense infatuation you know and and we know it's all part of human development right it's all part of your emotional development you know when you're about yay big girls are yucky you know but then you get a certain age kills aren't so yucky why because you're going from a boy to a man right and then you have a crush on one in the next minute you know you forget that one then you have a yo this is the one you love this one well you think you do you forget that one and then there's this one or this one you know and it's like but why cuz it's a brief but intense infatuation I mean but when you find the real one hallelujah glory to God Amen it's not a it's not just a crush that comes and goes and anchors and it just gets better and better all the time I'm out of trust you married ones know what I'm talking about Holly why because it's gone beyond a crash to a real love see it crushed just lasts for a moment amen if one even over the age of I don't know you know she'd know what I'm talking about here yeah you know that's like you get so caught up in sight now we know this is not just about people but it can be about things be about hobbies be about places to live different jobs all those it should be a brief I want to do this now and then next minute I saw I don't want to do this is dumb yes you know it's just it's just this kind of way cuz the brief intense oh yes and both but what's the problem as someone being led by their emotion as opposed to God leading them maybe the Word of God discerns it divides asunder spirit and soul so it actually can actually make a demarcation between this is just your feelings and this is your soul this is the word of God abiding in your soul guiding you because the devil tries to make it all mix into one and just live for the moment live in the now you know and the problem is our society is engineered in such a way that that's we are conditioned to to be such but I'll say life is not just a tick-tock video right it's not just a five-minute clip on you know you know on YouTube or something on Instagram or you know that's not how life is and people who are your influences they just show you this part of their life this small little fraction but they put it out there and and the thing is because the world is flooded with that those kind of people then what happens then there then our emotions begin to go and say I wish I could have what they had and you don't know that they just spent you know they're on the verge of burnout because they're running out of material and they're all stressed and they've got to find this and it's just you know there's just one big pressure pressure cooker of a life or but I want that what's happened and a big your emotions are being been grabbed by fantasy world and this isn't just with young people this is this is all of us and I say why do people have midlife crisis and they go buy some big crazy Carroll they go do some crates like their life can just go on and then bomb what's happened it's because our lives change it's not just us when we go them from from children to to adults but you know we go through your women go through middle you know menopause and your men go through the same kind of thing you know there's a change in life every so often and and we're going to be real careful when we come up to those changes you know because unless the Lord guides us through it you know brother Ram I heard brother brown tell him talk about sister heady right sister Edith I think it was and you know she was she was well she was in a wheelchair but there wasn't a problem at that time she was you know all thought she was dying and you're all stressed and troubled and things and brother and said you know she's just going through menopause you should go down go go down visitor you know sit with her tell her she's looking good she's fine and you you know trying and Carriger you hear it on tape who said that what because she's going through that struggle and it wasn't because she wasn't a believer it's just because she's trapped in this thing that's the same thing with us you know we are we are not immune from from change in age you know you know life is a constant change as I said I think last Sunday you know many of us want to go back to our childhood and we've taken a snapshot in our mind of our favorite part of our childhood and we want to go live in that but actually what it is is just a composite of different nice memories merged into one and the reality of where you were and what you remember can be two different things right because also you were thinking with a child's mind back then you don't know the struggles of your parents you know what was going on maybe in the nation or in the neighborhood or whatever you're just living in this little bot bubble you thought if I could only go back and live in that we can't go back living that we can't go back living up us we're going to keep walking on you know we you know even even families we know brother and says this this your families go through day times and they go through night times everything's running fine then it's like they hit the side of the road and go along the gravel it's a nighttime there's trouble there goes daytime again he says always those things kind of run they meant so but we you know we just got to keep walking on we're gonna stay balanced in a very unbalanced world and it's our emotions because this world is so supercharged by emotion feelings and they're there's nothing you know you're like a crushed people but thing is you know those things can last beyond just a brief moment to actually for quite a while years you know people will start relationships just because they hooked up or they just like each other and they just see where it goes that is never gonna last that is never oh he's got such nice big feet or his nose is smaller you know that's why you know why do you like her while she's got black here and when heaps of other people gobble you know but but there's nothing there's it's only a emotional connection physical connection there's nothing deeper than that that will hold them right but I think oh this is how it is because what I see in the movies and it's just like I'm in a movie you don't want to be trapped in a movie or some awesome podcast or something on Netflix or whatever streaming channel there is you know you don't want to be caught up ah that's how life is no that's not even how their lives are I think I told you you know he's they're flatmates that love Shortland Street and they used to watch it you know religiously every day and then the Omnibus on the weekend you know but they would be so outraged when characters would do things I can't believe he did that I can't believe she cheated on him I can't believe this happened and I'm like number one it's a script number two if that was just boring everyday life do you think people would watch it you know if you know people are just watching some say that's just what I go through every day well turn them enough we'll go do something else people want an escape you know but they got so engrossed with these characters they were so outraged when they did stuff you know why because they're emotionally involved with a TV show just like I was with scrubs wanting to be a doctor lord help us Esau I'll never end up on that path okay good luck you know this is everyone with me today I trust you're thinking a bit deep what's guiding me Lord remember the decisions you make now you will be in five years the decisions you make right now you will be in five years time you know sometimes you say how did I end up like this well five years ago you made a decision and you started walking a certain way and this is what the result of your decision is that so should be lured by your may my choices be your choices my decisions be based on your word and nothing else no not how I feel if I'm up from down left the right lord I just want to walk with you amen so as I said human development a crash is part of normal human development but this world has been engineered to keep us all teenagers just going from one thing to one thing to one thing to one thing try this do this do this play this through the stop this you know that's how society has been engineered that's stability you you look at unfortunate people's lives are very unstable why because they've been engineered a certain way remember the reason we think the way we think in this country is because of this country right the culture the socio economics whatever the founding whatever documents all those things we think a certain way because of it but if I was raised in Australia it just wouldn't be my accent that would be different or if I was raised in South Africa cuz my dad's from Cape Town I would think a different way or if I was from America or Canada or Europe if we're in Switzerland would think a certain way because of the spirit and the culture and the place but when we are born again right I have a Kiwi passport but I'm not a Kiwi no more right physically maybe yes but but my daddy's in heaven right so I'm not a white man I'm not I'm not a Kiwi I'm I'm a child of God and that's my identity that's what I want to be identified with when everything's said and done hallelujah and that speak and and what I love that's why I love about this message you go anywhere around the world and you find people of the same spirit you know I was with I was with brother Adrian in Vanuatu once upon a time and we were we were in Port Vila and we went to a pastor's house and and so his wife did not speak English she spoke French because Vanuatu the course is all the local languages but because of the French and the and the British they they colonize parts of the island half them speak English and half them speak French and she didn't speak English and but but I could speak a bit of both Lama because I knew pigeon from from Papua New Guinea and we had this very broken up conversation about the Lord and it was glorious why cuz the spirits the same you know and as any yeah you go to Africa same spirit same kind of people he come here saying go be able to rally the same kind of people Papa you get any same kind of people you know I met people in Papua New Guinea and they and they they they live in the back of the back of the beyond rural rural rural you know just like barely generators working kind of you know you meet them all you just have a great time why because it's the same huts the Holy Ghost same citizenship same language Amen same same founding document you know holy same outlook on life amen but we must never let anything divide that amen so so the effect of you know there's been a lot of studies done where we're now we're living with a generation of men in the world that emotionally still boys because of the effect of gaming social media internet culture and those things that we have today whether we like it or not and it says the millennial generation which is me and younger so we're to say Lord take us beyond just being a boy man you know we don't want to be a bunch of boy men we don't want to raise our sons and now I can say that because of having one I don't want to raise my son as a boy man you know sits on his computer all day or does that y'all just just just wants to have fun all day and you know nothing serious and you know we want to say lord help us to raise our family sure they're kids they can have fun but when they get older when you become an adult you put away childish things yeah so you know help us Lord amen so it can be it's not just young people that are fashioned this way it's old people now you know yeah anyway we'll leave that one see real love doesn't shift it has a real resting place it's not based on circumstance it's not based on appearance it's not based on money or no money wonderful mirror you know heaps of travel no travel big car no car broken car doesn't matter about those things real love is not based on that you're going through a hard time you go through it together you guys are a good time you go through it together you guys through a trouble time you go through it together you stay together because love keeps you together hallelujah so real love is very different to what the world calls love today cuz what the world calls love today is just a crush always so in love Nick minute I can't stand that guy hold on what went wrong from here to here actually the beginning was wrong because the beginning the relationship wasn't built on the Word of God it was actually built on just attraction let's see where this goes yo so many people they just live together for years then I should we get married uh yeah that the kind of just stumbling along in something with no plan no goal what's the what do you want at the end of the day what are you looking for because remember the ones we marry are actually a reflection of our character the ones are attracted to actually reflecting our character I mean so if you're attracted to someone in the world well that's probably what's in you but if you're attracted to someone who's real godly who knows the Lord that's the one you want because that one will stick with you through thick and thin amen now brother Brahim says here in divine love and sovereign grace he says and when that poor fellow standing there in the depths of my soul I felt so for him now this was the maniac who wanted to kill him and just as I was feeling sorry the Holy Spirit began to speak and the man fell across my feet it's wonderful to see what God can do in love love as the mightiest force there is amen do you know God is love he that loveth is of God now I don't mean affectionate love I mean godly love affectionate love creates lust but what I'm talking about is godly love real love you say well you know where is it there was a there was a man one day and and and he took a step wrong and he ended up living in tombs he's a maniac he is demon possessed he got enticed by something and it took him down that road he wasn't one day saying normal normal part of society Nick minute he's there that was he opened a door by an issue what happens when people get caught up in something like you know something they can't obtain they actually open a door to a spirit and that spirit there begins to lead them down a path it's never it's never actually to be you know a helpful part of the family that's never to be actually a helpful part of society until actually what can I get to actually feed this thickness that's leading me a mint and and and even it says here in Luke I believe it says that the spurts drove him down there the spirit and him drove him into the tombs so he has been driven by something as I that's what put that quote up we're all led by something and the spirits lead him to become isolated to cut himself liver and where death was this is you know he didn't he didn't he wasn't born in that condition he ended up in that condition because he opened the door to something right so so the spirit led him there to be isolated and that's why the thing is we're going to be real careful when we become real isolated within our own families I'm just going through something I'm just dealing with zero I'm just and it becomes this very internal looking kind of life we can't become that way that's dangerous and because because it it starts with I'm just dealing with this and then it goes to know and understands me and then you just begin to withdraw from the ones that can actually help you right and then if you can't find help from them because or they don't understand me I'm gonna stay over of them you'll find out from something and that issue that actually crowd that open door the spirit comes in and it will draw you somewhere else and you don't actually get help from that thing but member spirits come great together so lord help us oh here we are I'm glad there's someone tech-support prays a lot and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against Galilee and when he went forth to land they meet him out of they met him out of the city a certain man which had Devils long time and wear no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs and when he saw Jesus he cried out fell down before him and with the loud voice said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of God Most High I beseech thee torment me not for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftimes it had caught him and it he was kept bound with chains upon me and in fetters and he break the bans and was driven of the devil until the wilderness spirits drive people to do things you know I you know I might be wrong about this but I remember reading an article about the there was a there was a guy in Norway that killed a hundred odd hundred and forty odd people youth at a camp a few years back with a you know just just machine gun them and and and he said well right about him that actually before he went to go do the thing he kept being sick and he didn't want to do burners like something just drove him to do it was the spirit the demon spirit drove him to do it you know it's not really man is not really made to kill one another it's got to be a spirit or saying they she to take life that that comes into us now I just want to wait I want to read this account now here's a young lady and and she's actually living in an illusion because of hurt a young lady last night in an interview she said and she said a minister's daughter had had some kind of a little love affair and she had lost her mind about it she'd gone a breakdown a very beautiful young woman and about 23 years old and when she was a little girl about 12 she was in Chicago and sitting in the meeting or Elgon that was and sitting in the meeting and the Holy Spirit went out through the audience and called her who she was and said you've got a murmuring heart the doctor says you can't live to 15 years old but thus saith the Lord you're healed she never even left even so she never even felt a heart trouble since but last night she had a different kind of a heart trouble it was a spiritual heart trouble her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love and this boy telling that he was in love yet with her and his father had caused it I said Oh nonsense he didn't have to marry the other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you so so so here's this girl 23 years old had a breakdown had broken heart because someone who said that he loved her basically lied to her had just had an infatuation had a crush and when I married someone else but he's trying to say no it's my dad cause this that's a lie but someone is just trying to cover themselves but no see he's but the reason is he fell to have the right kind of love for you he can seem so real so oh well yeah this is just us as how we're gonna be next minute what's happened but see but see now see that's exactly but see being all wound up into that the girl sit in there in such a stupid oh I know Johnny loves me I know see that's all she could see she lived in one little world by herself she formed herself in there see she didn't start this way but because of her she ended up this way because she became so obsessed with this Johnny that she believed loved her but yet the reality was he didn't love her he went and married someone else that was the reality because she was so caught up in her mind about it she says I know Johnny loves me and she makes fun little world and she just came just in this little bubble by herself he say well that will that can't happen it does happen this is the power of the human spirit when it's even been wounded he'll get caught up in a fantasy world I say but there's healing there's healing for these things I mean it's what I love about there's no case God can't fix I mean there's no one that God can't put right there's no one that God can actually make them from unbalance to balanced again and I took her by the hand I said listen to me and the Lord showed me a vision you see that she know do I know nothing about that something had taken place some transaction between them and when that was said then that snapped her right quick and I pray God would just snap some of us out of things I mean I said now while you're out of that look to Calvary there you're going out here and trying to drink and Anna ministers daughter of Pentecostal ministers daughter and doing the things you're doing trying to drown that sorrow that man and somebody that don't care the snap of their finger for you I said look yonder the Calvary girl that's the only way back we got to get to ourselves focus to whether we live or die single drown as Calvary Christ that's the thing God wants us to come back to us I mean so she is trying to drown her sorrow living in this world by herself oh I know he loves me drinking away drinking away the sorrow instead of coming out of it that's why the Lord discerned something in her life that snapped her out of it she actually came back to herself while her spirit was wandering wandering around it wasn't in reality is all caught up in this little life and she just tried to drown her pain the wrong way and then but God came on the scene and she snapped out of I said now look to this don't look to the bottle don't look to your fantasy world look to look to the cross where you can really get healing and deliverance hallelujah amen and maybe I'll just I'll just leave it there let's friends don't get caught up in a fantasy world don't get caught up in some great no the devil will will will will offer you the world but it'll give you none of it and it's just like a carrot dangled before a donkey and the donkey can never get the carrot but it will do everything it can to get the carrot don't look to those things we've all been hurt before thing you yeah that's the thing about living in this world we get hurt we get wounded there's misunderstandings people you know come and even intentionally just use us and throw us on the roadside and you know but don't look to those things look to Calvary look to your deliverance I mean don't don't don't live in a fantasy world you say well this is this is all kind of very different maybe it is but it's not we need real love not a fake love this world is just all full of fake love you know it's just all of us don't get caught up in it get real love now brother Graham sees this here I can find it this is from enticing spirits they'll finish with this with our heads bowed just a moment absolutely with our heads bowed just a moment I wonder if there's someone here this morning his brother Brown I'm sick of tired of these little old things he's sick of living in a fantasy world he's sick of living in this idea that he could never obtain that's not even real he's sick of living there you want a real life you're gonna have a but real life is boring in a real life is wonderful real life is the best life that's the only life there is it's not living through a computer screen living off you know the internet it's actually real life I'm sick and tired of these little old things I've got pity things that have hang on me so long I'm always talking out of turn I'm doing things I shouldn't do and I know it's not becoming of a Christian I don't want to do that God knows I don't and I don't want to listen to that old spirit anymore because what is it there's a spirit what was what was keeping her in that world the spirit was talking to her keeping her in that world I Johnny loves you yes he loves you I know he loves you you know keeping it that way kept her in this own little world I don't want to listen to that old spirit anymore that's a thing that's kept me down all my life a fantasy will always keep you down why do why do so many rock stars movie stars they take their lives and they glamorize it why because they because they get given the world you can be this great thing but then the brokenness and the abuse and everything that comes along with it that's never portrayed on screen the emotional damage and the scarring and the hurt that they carry and it becomes too much they begin you and many of them overdose and things at certain ages they kill themselves why because what they think they're going to obtain in the reality of it has two very different things I mean and money will never buy you happiness and will never buy you have it doesn't matter what people try and tell you yo it doesn't matter what influence it puts a picture on the internet about some great lifestyle that they have I'll never buy them happiness because always trying to live in a moment create a moment you know the great thing about traveling is the people you meet that's the thing it's not the places for people that's the thing that makes traveling actually really great it's not the places but they try and say this place is amazing and you go there you're standing on this windswept rocky peak and it's freezing and you say this doesn't look like the filter they put through their photo but people try and catch an illusion it's like a mirage you know is it oh there's water there they get to there's no water it's here it's over there people are chasing something and it keeps them down all their lives I mean it's the thing that kept me down all my life from having real love and freedom in Christ I want you to pray for me brother Bram that'll leave me this day will you raise your hand every he'd be bow god bless you Oh dozens of hands little pity things little old things that make you talk or start some kind of a little fussing in the church makes you taking sides with one another like that oh

don't want that thing no more I'm sick and tired of it I am ready today to discard it I'm coming now Lord and I want to get away from all my selfishness if my brother don't treat me right I'll pray from anyhow if my daddy don't treat me right I love him anyhow as my wife don't treat me right or my husband I'll go go about humble before God Lord I look only to your kingdom I want my mind straight
