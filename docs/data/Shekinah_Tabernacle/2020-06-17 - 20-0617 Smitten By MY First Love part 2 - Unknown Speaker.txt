divine love of God that is Lord Jesus we're asking for more we're asking Lord for a greater revelation of your love Lord Jesus father that it's ever been that anyone in any church at any age has ever experienced Lord we need that for father Lord the enemy is end is coming soon and he's very angry and he's he's doing everything he can to stop it he's doing everything he can to thwart his destiny which is the lake of fire and he's going there Lord and he's not happy about it and he's going to be bound a thousand years and he's not happy and Lord he's pulled out all the stops in this land this end time but father Lord we know that when the enemy pulled out all the stops but how God came down and pulled out all those stops hallelujah Oh God a Living God without limitation you're holding nothing back load it's all your love today it's all of it there's no reservation now it's all hallelujah and we want to give all load it doesn't mean anything when we give 90% Lord it means nothing only a hundred it's a night Lord we've come to give you a hundred we don't want to give you 99.9 we want to give you a hundred we hold on to nothing anymore Lord it's not worth it and here we are Lord humbled by your presence that you'll love further speak we want to know more about you when I hear from you tonight Lord this is your service father we humble ourselves under your mighty hand and thank you with all that's within us long or we give you our soul and everything Lord Jesus have your way and me a night speaker in here now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you welcome to the house of the Lord it's so good to be here amen anyone with income song leading image but you're welcome a man who feels welcome does everyone feel welcome tonight amen hallelujah you know you know brother Branham in those prayer lines he he would know there was a welcomed spirit when a true believer came before him and he said your spirits welcomed and I believe tonight if you feel welcome it means there's something anew that's resonating with the Holy Ghost and if you don't feel welcomed or something's grating just snicker something wrong something good will happen to you hey man hallelujah amen god bless you thank you brother bin for the opportunity to minister and you know you get a burden on your heart amen and the Lord knows and he tells the pastor amen thank you musicians who loves the musicians they men came in praise the Lord we appreciate you guys amen hallelujah creating an atmosphere hallelujah while we're standing can we turn in our Bibles now just to John chapter fourteen hallelujah and I want to speak on smitten by my first love and we all know that our first love as Jesus Christ amen and he's coming this day to smite us with love amen and so you know you you want to be you want to be you want you want that love to strike you deeply in your life so that it's not just and you know knowledge I mean we can have a knowledge of his love and we should and it's good to have a knowledge but it has to go deeper than a knowledge and even experience you can have an experience but if that experience doesn't remain and continue then it's just a past thing but to be smitten as to be consumed by his love amen and so that's the context of the title and we're in part two it says here in John 14 verses 18 to 21 yeah man can you please turn that heat down a little bit I'm gonna cook actually take this off now she's here in John 14 18 I will not leave you comfortless I as a personal pronoun I will come to you he says this is Jesus speaking to his disciples while he was here in corporal form and he says here yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I love ye shall live also amen you know he was we've sung was trampled on the ground but he lives he rose again a man that wasn't the end of the story I'm so glad who's glad that that's not the end of the story hey man ate that day you shall know that I am in my father and your and me it makes you an eternal being and his mind and his thinking somewhere in that eternal mind of God you were there we were there at that day you shall know that you shall know that I'm and my father you and me I knew and it could say because I'm in you and in here he that hath my Commandments and this is where I want to focus now into our for this particular subject he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him may God bless his word you may be seated now that is the burden of my heart for this and actually was we never got to it in part one really but as the scripture here because for all my life ever since I was first Saved should I say when I say life I mean my life after getting saved because that's when life only began life never really began until then really truly because you had to find other things to make you happy and all the stuff you would never satisfy but then God then he came he changed everything hey man who can who can testify that life began when you met the Lord Amen you may sit in church all your life but life will begin when you meet him Amen really true life and I can speak to all of you little young children tonight all the young children so life begins when you meet him and church stops becoming something you have to enjoy you don't want it to end after that Amen I don't want it to end amen my stomach starts getting hungry I don't care I just want to enjoy rejoice in the lord because i'm enjoying hearing what he has to tell me and his spirit we're communing as a communion with the real joy giver you know we sing this song you alone are the real joy giver the ethel of my eye you know this is real close stuff here this is relationship this is this is a relationship that you feel and i want to get to that because god wants us to feel he wants feeling to be involved in our relationship with him and with each other and yet we're in a world this world is designed to break that I mean ultimately wants to break the relationship between the bride and Christ by distractions and all these other things but you know he he takes pride this is the devil now he takes pride and and breaking down human relationships natural human love he takes pride and breaking that down that's what society has done that's why friendships now are through a screen how easy it is for you to really speak your mind through a screen through a text or through some media you know or even not even directly to someone but just to everybody you can just speak your mind you can say whatever but then you go in person and you and you meet the people and you can't actually communicate and the reason is is because of the ease of this whole media world and it's designed to break the connection between human beings right and we don't want that because connection is everything you know when it comes to relationship you've got to be connected and there's many reasons why it's hard for people to connect many reasons complexes hurts whatever that happens in their life that make some oneness kid you know something maybe you know like a child that loses their parents young you know from that time you know they're scared to connect with something they don't want to go through that pain again they don't want to go through the pain of being so connected with somebody in and they don't want to save as a fear of separation as the fears and anxiety it can cause all types of trouble and therefore they struggle to love now that's a very severe example there's many examples this that comes in many levels it can be a mild thing but still the mild things as the ones that really when we start to really get serious with God and he starts to deal in our life and we want to really be connected to him and we want to see the supernatural right we want to see the supernatural in our life we want to see we want it we want him as he says here to manifest himself to us I mean there is your inheritance and if he's not it doesn't mean you're not a believer you're doing something wrong they just maybe a little thing in your life that is just the bridge a little bridge something that's why when we're at church judgment begins at the house of God and you sit here not with the guard up and like oh man I'm just gonna I hope he better not preach against me you know that there when you do that if you get that my scene you get like it maybe a bit angry or a bit resentful about what's coming well actually you're just gonna miss your blessing you'll miss your opportunity because no preacher well I can't stand for everybody but at least me in and I know brother Ben would sure no one here would preach I'm gonna just I'm gonna hit the head I'm gonna get that I know all the stuff not it's not like that you just got to do what the Lord wants you to say right and the Lord is working so powerfully now you know like it's just really the the Word of God is just so strong it's so accurate and and he's getting down to the weightier matters of our life and he's coming down into our homes he's coming down into our families he's coming down into our bedrooms he's coming down everywhere into our life to to to to bring everything back to the way it should be the way it was before Satan corrupted the human race and he is doing that by his love he is doing that by his grace now remember when divine love is projected when you start to radiate divine love when divine love starts to come out and starts to manifest in your life you what happens is your flesh starts to really have love in it because now you're expressing the love it's now coming all of a sudden the atmosphere is changing the church changes and lives people feel like God you know what I can actually I might go to the pastor now he's not gonna laugh I'm he's not going to just ridicule me he's gonna help me people want to help each other because that's love and and so a prophet would come and say when divine love is projected Sovereign Grace can take its place amen now ultimate the ultimate revelation of that of divine love being projected was the father came and stepped into a human body and what the earth is a savior that was divine love manifested in the flesh this was the greatest personification of love was when God became a man and suffered like nobody else could suffer and take the penalty of sin so that we could be free and so divine love was projected and Sovereign Grace took its place in the form of God and flesh that's and and so and then then he said right here I go but I will send you a comforter I'll come to you amen and he's in love with me so here you see where I'm going there's a connection now he that loveth me will keep us my Commandments not he that thinks it's a good idea and I should do it because I have to and it's enforced upon me by leadership that's not it that doesn't work the human nature never gets changed in their sovereign grace can't work in there it's not the right atmosphere but there's an atmosphere that can change there's an atmosphere that can change people that can raise people up and work on them and that's love and so here we are in this end time to connect with God and so I encourage you work on your relationship with them work on it it takes work that's not works but it takes work do you know what I mean now you are the branch and here's the vine and has spirit is like the SAP and it's energizing you you just got the branch and you you just do what the vine the set comes up and you just say I'm fruitful amen hallelujah that's what you need to do just be fruitful then I have to produce it you the law will make you try and produce it there will be a pressure on you to push you into an image to push you into something but that that's not the kingdom principle kingdom principle is the step comes out love comes unto you and you work on your relationship with him and you identify things come over the pulpit things come through sermons or whatever when you're praying and God speaks into your dreams whatever it visions however he wants to show you and he starts to help you he gives you a key little points something that you need to do too so that that's that maybe it's a behavior or an attribute or a family trait or something that's hindering and we're talking like minut little things but the Lord is particular you know his grace see His grace looks beyond and it's not that mean you're not saved it doesn't mean that you're out of us out of his favor but it's just we're just getting the land you know we're getting a little bit more every day amen we're growing into his image and so because of that you know he'll put his finger on something and you say yes yes or I don't want that in my life amen I need because you see now through this connection as you work on your relationship with him and love now love real true love should not stay just in your heart you know what I mean now I'm going oh I know it sounds a bit different but it's actually true true love should not remain enclosed and sealed in it needs to be expressed amen this is like a way of explaining it if someone says to me how do I bring Jesus on the scene you know I will tell them fall in love with them love them so much just fall in love with them because because the love yes they word of I hid in my heart and my love it's in my heart but you see it's got to break out there's more I mean it's not gonna run out you know he he broke the seals he opened the book you are also a book a living written epistle and and and in the breaking of the seals that released him but it didn't just release him it released you and so there is grace today to release you so that divine love can be projected and then Sovereign Grace takes its place but now you are his representative you are the branches you're the place where his fruit is born you're the place where his fruit cancel can go Wow I like that there's something about that person there's a sweetness there there's a purpose for further it's the carry seed it's to bring forth life and when there's fruit in your life when you're so in love of the Lord amen it makes you act a little bit different it makes you change things now it becomes a motive and it's the key motive of the economy of God is love he don't need no money in heaven actually actually the money that the pinnacle of money on this earth was going to be our pavement hey man we're gonna walk on it streets of gold amen worthless up there but that's the devil's that's his economy and that's what man strives for this metal that's our pavement now God was telling us something there at the pinnacle of what the devil now God says I'm going to make that pavement you watch and my people are going to overcome the devil overcome all of us evil and they're gonna love each other even at a time where there is no love left in the world there's going to be a people that are in perfect love manifesting the grace of God and becoming God's grace and flesh this is what it is with your yielded to the spirit and you're a branch that has grafted on the vine you are His grace and flesh because he will use you let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt knowing how you ought to answer every man but take no thought what you shall say don't concoct up a big thing in a big essay and some big intellectual thing it doesn't work but the father's be desire that you may be inspired by the Spirit of God because that is what he wants don't think nets just for the ministry don't think that's just for some preacher or some prophet or something there no every life can have a portion of his inspiration have a portion of his power have a portion of his grace have an anointing there is an anointing of God that is for you according to your calling according to your gifting as this Watersafe brother sweet something heavens to Stokes value water when you leave it in the glass it turns into like cyanide or something I don't know why it must be a chemical reaction amen and so to consolidate all of us the more we love him the more he comes on the scene in our life and our family it sounds too easy and too simple to be true but it's actually but that's basically the whole that's what you're asked it's the main thing that's your ask just fall in love with them the Bible says and brother and posted it last week he says use the scripture thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart all thy mind and all thy strength all thy soul spirit and body so that every part of your life will be per Grady it permeated love them with all of it amen when you lift your hands up in the service responding to the presence of God you're loving them with your strength amen when you say amen and you're agreeing and you begin to behave differently you're loving them with your spurred and when you're in your soul as a born-again soul is just by default in love with Jesus amen amen you just you love them and many times we love them and we don't know it yet because it's so buried down and there's so many two miles and troubled when Israel came into the land they didn't have the land straightaway but it was this when you got born again you didn't have all your inheritance but it was yours and it was in you he came in and he started the work but then little by little little by little little by little you began to get all of that inheritance as you don't look that way or that way and don't get distracted by the politics all that sort of stuff but stay with the Lord stay with him he's the one that knows hey man he's got a whole system set in place he's got a whole economy and as we love as that love starts to come out as we love them with all of our heart all of our mind all about strength every area of our life begins to love them it begins to radiate what does what happen you book it becomes easy to do his walk we'll it becomes easy you you don't want to hurt him you begin to have a close relationship with them you begin to feel his presence more you begin to enter into intimacy greater than you've ever had it becomes more than just a robotic form we we've got to keep the message of the hour you know we're going to we're going to be this certain way the prophets did this and we're going to be like but you see it's gotta go higher than that it's got to be deeper than that and it can be and it's not hard as long as you fall in love with him John season 1 John 5 he says his Commandments to those true believers the sons of God it's not Grievous it's not a hard thing but you see you can be a son of God born again but if you're but if you get over encumbered and you start to get distracted and you start to veer on different things than you spread your affections you now your spirit now that you meet to love them with all of it remember all of it all can anyone say all in here all your spirit love them with all of it he wants all your affections now I know that's not easy because you know as a man and as sisters you you start to enjoy doing nothing maybe you enjoy making cakes or and you you can get really you can get really carried away with that you know and I in a man you can enjoy your you know you might have a hobby car or something and you can really start to put your affections just go they gravitate now all I'm asking is just monitor then monitor it because you what you'll find its before long it won't just be the car it'll be this project it'll be that project it'll be your job maybe you want to get a promotion you start to put your heart more into that and all of a sudden your whole spirit is now divided out and it's divided over all these things which aren't necessarily bad things but they as a man or as a woman they take the place of God collectively now one thing maybe okay or two or three maybe all right but win it but what happens is it just goes like this and it just snowballs until your life is full and your affections of sprit twosome and then it then that love know that the love I'm talking a feel the true deep rich personal love the contact the connection with God the the the thing that makes it easy for you to live a holy life that makes it easy for you to walk with God you an opportunity amen hallelujah and the opportunity is fall in love with him amen you know the ecosystem and economy of God personified anew we read in Song of Solomon 2 verse 8 to 15 it says the voice of my beloved behold he come leaping upon the mountains skipping over the hills my beloved is like a row a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall and he looketh forth at the windows showing himself through the letters see this is a love affair this is a love relationship this is this is how the Lord works he begins to reveal himself to you and he and well what he's looking for is he's looking for he's looking to woo he's looking to bring he's looking to stir your emotions it sees it he's looking now this sounds bad but this is King James language he's looking to move your bowels it sounds really bad but this is the old English language it actually means to to you just feel like you're almost going to be sickly you're so infatuated ly in love now I know that we preached about going beyond a crush and this is beyond a crush but you see there is a higher love but then it's got to drop down it's going to be everywhere it's got to be more than just an idea or a glorious thing that you rejoice about you can rejoice about the love of God you can rejoice about the word but are you experiencing it is it as it let has it landed has it landed down home is it down in the house is God in the house you know it's really really manifesting in your life where where you've got victory amen hallelujah okay I just oki on reap so it says here see he's wooing you he's drawing you he shows himself through the lettuce be my beloved spake and he said and said unto me rise up My Love My Fair one and come away you see sometimes we find ourselves behind the wall behind a wall some wall that's distracting her some wall that keeping us from from really coming into a connection with him and he shows himself through he say Here I am come away just just just put down all those things listen to what your prophet told you lay aside everything until you get perfect love because without it or your works or your faith all of your things anything you could do for the Lord isn't it doesn't mean anything it's got you it means nothing that divine love with charity charity this is the the core of your connection to God this is the core where it would cause a church to succeed as divine love and this is why things work because of love love conquers all amen love is greater than all other I don't know what you would call them but things God is love and then so love is the greatest thing and when and in its and it's an opportunity now as you hear what I'm telling you because these things are very good not because it's me because it's the word but you can fall in love with him amen it can go beyond a duty of a believer I can go beyond a great rejoicing about Revelation and seeing a tall piece together which I love and it's glorious and we should love it but there is a love that makes all of that even greater because you see the one that wrote it the one that made it he will manifest himself to you amen you will see the supernatural in your life the gifts that he's placed the callings he will manifest them and your pew you will adore you just will go beyond warming up you you'll go beyond just living a mundane life amen it will become so much greater so much more hallelujah but so don't let the circumstances pull you down don't let all of the things that all the woes and all the thoughts and you get up in the night and all the thoughts come and all those things don't let them pull you down amen you said no Satan get away from me you know warfare now you have to use your authority you have to use what God's given you your a son your daughter you have a jurisdiction you have authority over him he doesn't he has no right to hold on to you he has no right to keep you down he has no right to hold you on the ground you can rise up above it and actually love the Lord even if you suffer with any type of mental things or whatever it may be you can love them more hallelujah amen who wants the Lord to manifest in himself to them you know what that means to reveal openly to declare the the fullness the revelation of him not about him but him himself we're talking about a being a person love himself real true love if you want that you need to love him you know it's like this is this whole thing in that day you shall know that I am in the father and you're and me now love will really bring that into ya you know we want to call Jesus on the scene and prayer and call him down and he and he comes down amen and we enjoy it but what if you were just so in love he's always with down hey man and I believe that sound heritance why don't you claim it why don't you claim it and never let the devil rob you of the hope that you're gonna have that Amen I'm talking about biblical hope now not just lotto hope it's not hope that's just something dangle but I'm but real hope is an expectation with pleasure and anticipation based on a true biblical promise a biblical promise that you can have divine love soul in your life so in your life that it would just radiate amen hallelujah my beloved says here the fig tree where are we sorry I'm adverse this team my beloved spake and he said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away come out from those walls come out from those family things come out from your the culture that would limit you to what you think that you are and come out of it and come with me come and skip on the mountains with me come down and I'll lead you through the valleys and I'll take you through it all amen just fall in love she's here now the fig tree put 1/4 of green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away o my dove they're out in the cliffs of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet as thy voice and thy countenance is comely hallelujah but take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vine for our vines have kinder grapes ya see you see as a believer the Lord is always budding there's always something welling up there's always something happening in your life there's always something there's a little bad these little grapes coming but there is foxes you know these foxes want to come and pick them and take them and break your vines down that's what they're trying to do I'm gonna hit that god is hitting it he's hitting it amen you know this is a real basic simple elementary thought but he's hitting that he's really hitting that in your life and and you know we we if you really see what's going on here you our soul especially the teenagers and the young children but all of us there is a battle for our soul our soul is what is the battle for that between God and Satan and and and and there's it's raging because you see Satan's not a gentleman he'll just rip you and he will pull you into what he wants he won't care about being gentle but he has he does have his limitations he can't step up beyond the boundaries of God's spiritual Lords and and what God said in place for you beings otherwise there wouldn't be even anything because he would just destroy everyone so there is boundaries for him but it's not a gentleman and if you let him in if you just give him a little bit he'll destroy but if you give God just a little bit that's all he'll take he will never breach your free moral agency he will never go beyond what you allow people who you and he knows you more than anyone else and he knows what's gonna innos what will bring you in he knows what's going he knows you more than you know yourself he knows the chemicals your body made of he knows all the glands and he knows all of that and he knows how to make that nice he knows how to keep your house this is your house and we find so many people suffering under mental conditions and then they go to the doctor and they take their blood and they see there's a chemical imbalance it's not because they're born that way it's not born that's the breach in this buret there's a emotional bruise that's a scar something deep or multiple and those are the things that the devil uses against people those are the little foxes that will spoil the vine all right but if you walk now this is where because we've got to walk this walk and we're not perfect yet in this flesh right but there's a victory to be won there's a victory tonight there's a victory next week there's a victory every day if you want it amen there's a victory for you you can walk into that victory you can claim that victory but there must be a fight in you there must be some real you're gonna have guts amen you understand don't don't just cower down all you know because that doesn't work don't have a pity party even if you feel like it tell your flesh you can shut up I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna praise God right now carry your sorry flesh to what it should be doing and love the Lord you just say you know what yeah what can I do Lord then I can love you more and I'll tell you something you know even if you don't want to do it because maybe you're in a condition or someone's in a condition in their struggling just absorb the word to move of the word anew that's just the basis to start to build you to give you some strengths so that you can now we know when you start to do that it starts to generate a strength of with a new until now now you can say lord help me love you more what is it and then you come in church and because you've been listening to the word because you there's something you've been feeding the right thing in your life now you become a bit more sensitive and now when the preacher preaches you get affected by it and it actually it does something for you you know you you begin to engage with the Lord you begin to hear a fruit you begin to hear a nugget and it's for you and you hear it and you receive it and you don't miss it because I can tell you even if you don't see it and you missed it if it's like these nuggets for everybody all the time you can every person in this room can leave the service blessed completely changed if you see it if you catch it just be alert you know and I think you know we want to fall in love with the Lord because we won't love to be here in this mental and here we want you know we want God was skinned on we want God around us amen hallelujah I know it sounds real simple but just fall in love with them fall in love with him work on that and for profit we know to be on the other could and the time and comes back and he says lay aside everything until you get perfect love nothing matters until you have that and that is obviously the Holy Ghost but you see you can get the Holy Ghost and he begins to bring you to your adoption he begins to develop you so with a net there is going to be barrels within your journey and fellowship with God this is what I'm talking about now you know I encourage you get the Holy Ghost of course hook if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you need to get down in there there's the altar don't wait tonight make it yours you know there's no delay you know that if you ask the Lord will give it to just know his provide away lay your life down and let him value amen but what I'm talking about is now walking with them in your land okay and you've got battles and you can get over incumbent you can get beaten down but if this love be genuine genuine love hallelujah something's gonna happen something's going to just take over so much more hallelujah you know there was tribes that just get got hold like Caleb when he was like a he just he just he just caught it straight away and he walked on and he got his land and he got us inheritance and he sat down he had a good time hello yeah and his family had a good time and there was a they just caught it but there was others that took so long they just it says they they procrastinate it I don't know if it used that word but they they they delayed their inheritance because they just made friends with the enemy and they they didn't take it too seriously but this is serious it's serious and if you take it seriously and really get your the other foundation right you get filled with the spirit let's not just hang around Jericho you know don't just hang around the start you know that's too easy you don't get anywhere and you can get stagnant and and all the leads and things just start to you you've got to progress you've got to go on you've got to move the Lord there's got to be something for you amen hallelujah fall in love with the Lord fall in love with them something happens glorious happens that's going to help your spirit that's going to help your flesh not converted remember this the only thing that's going to that's going to really give you the victory over your flesh ultimately is the body change it's never going to get converted but there is a way there is a solution to this age-old problem of self there's a solution to a troubled human spirit that is waiting for delivers that is waiting for healing that is waiting and remember you don't get it all at once he says I'll give you the land little by little I'll give you your I'll give you victory over yourself I'll give you victory over all the enemies little by little you'll land here at the land you will get your inheritance little by little even though it's already in you I'll give you access to it you will come to a point where you'll have full access to all of it and it won't trouble you anymore you won't say that stupid thing anymore you won't get yourself into trouble by the things you say hello me let's me okay I'm always getting myself in trouble by this and I pray every night lord please when is it time when there's a Time Lord but this thing here and I can really mean who says that James I think me and James up in heaven you know James the the writer of Booker James he says the tongue can no men tame and unruly evil but the Holy Ghost now there is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can come soul into your life hallelujah that will give you such temperance that you will be able to decide you may still get angry something might upset you but you'll have the power of decision the power to decide whether I hurt somebody with my tongue or whether I say no you know what I'm gonna have divine love right now and if you've got love in your life like real love the practicality of this is is working on their Lord how do I love you more as there is this something in my life that would hinder that is there something that I'm doing is there something in my in my spirit that would breech-block it here's the Lord is here to deliver that the Lord is here to heal if there's a breach he says I'll bind up the breach of my people and I'll heal the stroke of their wounds that's what he says this is the promise for our hour I'm gonna heal the stroke heal it wounds and I'm gonna bind up the breach of my people so you don't have to have breaches and we've got breaches right and because we got breaches we have troubles but there's something that's going to subdue that and that's love love will subdue your unruly your unruly spirit until we and because you need something to walk in love because as time goes on is the end draws near the devil's game is getting stronger and stronger and the Lord is getting stronger stronger and the more that we raise up to our position the more the devil gets cast out the more he gets pushed down because he's getting pulled out of his position by the by your rising to your position and we've heard that so as you rise up as you take it as the love of God is so thick in this place until there's nothing he can do because there's just love and no matter what he tries and this is like a this is part of it the faults that get revealed in your life can be healed not judged by each other there's no prickles to go home look at that I've got that one hole we better go and attack that and then they stay the same no this is about growing this is about there is a love atmosphere that can allow change that is sovereign grace taking its place sovereign grace takes its place when divine love is projected and divine love will be projected when you fall in love with him fall in love with him in the name of the Lord I I just encourage you work on it work on it there's something in your this there is something for you to have it's love more of love and so as I said earlier don't hide it in your heart it's not made just to stay there it's actually it's a love the eternal life its living for others and so it's going to come out it's got a break you see you see the seed of your life like the the holy of holies it's like your heart and and it's brought the veil was rent right the that's been broken the seals been broken the tomb is open of your life like Martha here's the resurrection her life and he's standing there and it's roll away the stone Martha you've gotta roll away the stone the stone is standing between your resurrected life in the resurrection himself and that stone is whatever is holding you back that's told us he's standing there is the resurrection he's looking at you through the lattice through the wall he say come out come away roll away the stone and come out come forth come with me walk with me walk with me hello yeah we can find it we can run we can do whatever but we'll never be satisfied until we we come to connect what we're made here what we're made for you're made for it he didn't God is God right now we can go and watch this other stuff and it can distort our image of God it can distort our image of humanity and we start to think our life was about something else but life is all about God God created the world he created the universe and then he created people and there was a people that he would be in fellowship with and He commands to be God that you would let him be God and he made you for that divine purpose and he's placed talents and personality in you to perfectly suit that coin anything else will never satisfy it'll just be a temporal thing and it may wreak havoc there may be confusion but it will never satisfy like being connected you know about the Brenham he sees us in dr. Moses there is a great oh sorry it's my little title to know what I'm talking about I read that and now know the context of the quote so we certainly welcome you eases our beloved friends and love with the Lord Jesus may his spirit stir you tonight and your emotions greatly to love her more and more let's see this is something and I pray and I say Lord I can just I can share but you need to stir the people it's your grace it's your anointing it's your that's it's you Lord to stir the people to stir up because our emotions need to be stirred and I know we don't judge everything by emotions and feelings but they are part of it they are company they're complementary just like a man in his home his wife is complementary and the man doesn't just get rid of his wife because he doesn't want to be led by his wife or live by you know the the feelings of his wife and any but we should we should actually incorporate our wife into a decision-making and we should you know she's part of us she was helping me for us she's part of us and so we should respect that and enjoy it and actually embrace that imbalance right perfect balance and love divine love because divine love redeems your wife to be a reflection of who you are hey man and she's just pushed down like this then then you know like that's not going to work either but she is the emotional part of the you know a lady is more emotional than a man and many respects but not always but generally typically a lady is the more is more the emotional part but you don't push her down and if you push her down that is a legalistic some tyrannical leadership that is based on some cultural limitation it's not it's not godly it's not kingdom of God ways and it's the same thing now in your own life your emotional realm she's like your complimentary help meet your emotions she's the one that helps you in decision making that doesn't make the decisions for you but you need emotions you need feelings about things you need to you need to be at interact with the world around you the people around you to be able to feel when when something happens this should be a register that is healthy that is holy that is righteous bettors has feeling Amen hallelujah we don't want to push that down but we and I promise you know just say mate this is what the Prophet says around and receive it may his spirit stir you tonight and your emotions greatly to love her more and more so there is something that the spirit can do there the Spirit of God can come and stir your emotions where it doesn't have to happen in the service but he can stir your emotions he can stir you greatly to make him love them you lover more and more because this is what we need we need that grace hallelujah he says here in questions and answers now I'll admit that people study too much they try to go too far ahead and try to sink too hard and sometimes have mental breakdowns and things on account of studying about the word you must quit there you don't have to do that remember now because of the education system you know we were geared towards our strengths will give us the knowledge because there's no life in education as Laurel doesn't it's not God right there's no there's no spirits well there are spirits and they're not good ones and they're not going to help you but God and the different he changes the whole thing around he's just become like a child and then and just yield and let me teach you let me reveal myself to you hallelujah this is the kingdom of God you don't have to do that the only thing I like that and I underlined only thing you have to do is fall in love with them I can't stress this deeply enough fall in love with the Lord and man if this is the last service I ever preached him we go to a rapture and I could just if there was one thing I could tell you and say to you that was the deepest most richest thing I could ever tell you as fall in love of Jesus Christ full of love with him amen approach God has provided way and fall in love with them everything else who jizz on that the whole commandments in the Lord the law and the commandments in the prophets hinge on that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy strength and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself her man and he says in the whole all law and comprar verts everything hinges that comes from that there's a great wellspring of glorious glory that comes out of this your connection to God your connection to the supernatural manifestation of Jesus Christ hallelujah your connection to the operation of the Holy Ghost in your life we need the operation of God in this church we need the supernatural manifestation of the Spirit in this church we need the operation of God in our homes in the family altar we need the operation of God in our workplace in our fatherhood in our motherhood in our childhood hallelujah and our brother in sisterhood and our professional life we need the supernatural manifestation of God because you see he has names he has a people that he's looking for that people that would choose him that he knew before the world ever began people and he wants to show you he wants to lead you he wants to cause divine appointments in your life and therefore there is a need for you to fall in love with Jesus Christ real true love it will eradicate the problems that you have in your spirit well it will it will subdue them they won't know what to do there won't be no room for complaining no room for moaning no room for murmuring no room for gossip no rooms with lust no room for any of those things that would trouble the the believer in the wall hallelujah because love what does it do it just brings it right up into a plane it's just you and the Lord you're walking the grassy meadows Amen hallelujah amen hallelujah you know you get a preview of what its gonna be like but just as just the spawn cuz neon my what is it gonna be like when we go there when we've got a body that can handle that type of glory you see there's only so much this body can handle but why not get it all why not have it all why not have all that God has allotted to the man who is walking adoption in a fallen body why not have everything that's available there is there's an allotment to men there's an inheritance to men and we are privileged in this age knowing that we're at the end knowing that he would give everything hey man he came down himself to give everything over and hand you the fullness of redemption and hand you all of it and say Here I am arise my love my fair one and come away come on walk with me come I rise up above those things let my love come down into your temple until your religion can't even stand in his presence you know amen and just go right on loving him he says amen that's not trying to push into something or make yourself something you're not just go ahead and let God use you in the way he wants to just yield yourself commit yourself and walk on happy singing rejoicing that's the way hey man I know it's real simple but you see now when when you get that right if we can just get that right the simplicity of having a joyful relationship with God does anyone in here just love the joyful relationship with God joyful now you're head of your times you'll have your moments this thing's thought to come out there's trials to be overcome all of those things but we want to walk rejoicing and you can you don't have to have a mediocre Christian walk you don't have to be boozed out you just need to believe believe them and fall in love because heat oh my I feel like I'm just repeating myself but you know you just really I've got a burden on my heart and I'm trying to just get it out and that is if you can just catch it the simplicity of it falling in love with Jesus is the most important thing the only thing is is that you have to do is fall in love with them you know and Song of Solomon 4 4 verse 9 it says now now that there's our love right and we love them and want to fall in love with them but now I want to just kind of switch around just quickly in closing man we only got like that far down but anyway and there's now a whole other side and it says love now when you really really there's a key in this because it's actually his love that will really help you fall in love with them more when you really now you've got to meditate on it this is not some intellectual thing you have there is a meditation on the word that's actually effective it will actually help you so you see there's a difference between trying to push ahead and learn and grow annoy and a strength of humanity but then there's a meditation on the word you know where you actually do just before God you know when David is set before God and then after he heard all that stuff from Samuel it's a set before the Lord basking in his presence just meditating on what was just told him there's a you know you've it's important to meditate on there if you hear something it's just for you meditate on it you know like actually think about it ponder it own it say Lord you know because quite often we get into a habit because we're in a busy age that was so good man that service was awesome and you enjoyed it and you rejoiced but then that's it where's the meditation with those nuggets that was just for you just for you and you never even bring it up again it might come back when you talked in fellowship Lynette but there's a power in meditating and in this instance has love you know when you really if you can just pray you know when his presence comes the Lord's presence is real thick and you you just appreciate even the smallest thing well you know that's I believe and you can have that in your house it doesn't just have to be a great service in Jewish or a great convention meeting it can be in your prayer room it can be with your children in your living room hey man hey man that can be right down there in your home and you're rejoicing with the Lord and he comes down and now when he comes down you know just meditate on the word when he comes down because what happens when he comes down as your mind becomes more alert and more you actually start to appreciate more and the little things and win it and so here when we start to read this when we read this in Song of Solomon 4 9 and this is now the Lord addressing the bride and he says here you have ravished my heart you know this is really really powerful you now you he's speaking to you you have ravished his heart that will ravish as to be transported by love to take it into another condition you have taken the Lord's heart you are a man and woman after God's own heart you know now we get distracted and we fail and we have all those other things but ultimately that seed with a new that's a new by predestination is ravished as heart that's so in love with God and it's a love that your even your flesh would disintegrate if it fully manifested because it's so powerful that's beyond this whole earth would just melt if that love that's already in you in a seed form and your soul that loved that's there ready to just break open into a new body and meet your Fiat any one day and go into a venture that love it's so powerful so thick so glorious now that love is a love that has and as that but what happens is that little seed that begins to grow in your life and you become more and more like them more and more loving more and more of an atmosphere in your life more of an anointing more of an action you know you want to be you want to have an action that pleases God or you say you just in a channel and you say that thing you know you say the right thing you say something and all of a sudden the presence of God just swoops down you said something that just resonated with the spirit you know that happens maybe we could say occasionally and sometimes it comes and seasons where it's happening a lot more and then it and it can dry up a little bit and then it comes back and you start to have that real closeness I truly believe that as we near therein and as we love them more because I believe you know this sort of stuff we are just like kind of just oh the Lord will just say speak around this sort of subject but there's a purpose for it it's not just to please our ears and make us feel nice and get us more victory there this is prophetic you know not the this is so but the whole the story about our church right we're in a prophetic line of we're just going in the prophecy of God and and we're eventually going to come into something and I believe that you know the love of God will come so thick and so strong out of our own life like a well because you are a well of living waters and we're just coming out and that resonation between us and the Lord will just become you know it's like musicians will know this but when you or people that know sound but when you the wind you resonate and you're bringing something into tune it goes at us and as it gets in tune it goes you know vibrates at the same and that's exactly what's happening with us we are coming into resonance with the Lord and if we now and again when his presence comes down and you just something just quickens to you and you say it and then he just swoops all over you and you just get caught alone that's some saying come away with me oh my you're coming up higher now you know we're going up into a more heavenly atmosphere we're coming up into a more glorious resonance coming in tune he's tuning you and tuning me and hallelujah this is here you have ravished my heart not me but have you you have ravished my heart my sister my spouse you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes man with one chain of unique how fear is your love my sister my spouse you know when brother Branham went up into heaven and his wife he saw her in a higher relationship which was a sister but a guest of honor that is the highest form of marital relationship as when you realize in an eternal perspective that your wife is actually your sister in heaven because you're all brothers and sisters and under God and yet she's a guest of honor in that place so this is just a little bit more closer than the rest but still a sister and I believe that he would express this to her as the highest form of love he would say you my sister my spouse I just love you you've ravished my heart you've taken my heart from being alone you know in Eden he said it's not good for men to be alone I must make I must bring a wife out so that he can have fellowship but he was resonating his own desire before in himself was a wife that needed to come out so that he could fellowship and so this love relationship is what we are really experiencing and the church has been through all the battles all the wars all of the ups and downs gone on the ground be come back up in a resurrection and grow and forth into denominations everywhere but then finally at the end it would be a true seed again that would rise up and she would get filled with the Holy Ghost and the word would open she would meet him and he would bring her out and she would come into a resonance with him again and vibrate at the same frequency until you have a John 5:19 experience in your own life who can I use kuben moodily does nothing unless the father reveals it to him from above you know he says here the son of man towards nothing except he sees what the father shows him that doeth the son of man likewise that doors could be moved into light like that door has been going likewise that doors shannon lee i likewise this is the resonance this is us coming up but it's what is the vehicle love is it something that you have to learn no are you glad you don't have to have intellectual power and some massive degree or anything like that or something you got to go on your knees up to the stairs or nothing just fall in love with them you want a ticket you want a ticket to a better walk fall in love of the Lord amen no matter what condition you are in now whether you're living in a sinful way or whether you're doing something they told us or whatever condition just fall in love of the Lord and force-feed yourself a little bit of message until you get to a point where you want to listen to it that's my testimony I was running from the Lord I ran from him for a long time about a year did my best but your doesn't work when the Lord's wanting you he's gonna get you a me and I'm so glad hallelujah and it came to a point where I realized you know this is this the black dog inside me she's gotten pretty strong and and he's calling the shots but something spoke to me as if no matter what you feel just put the message on so I tend to at night rule oh I don't want to hear it because I was still living a simple life but I just put it on and and be at work Here I am he did it something happened what happened was that I got stronger all sudden things started to change and I got strength hey man and then one day on the end of my beard I laid it all down and I got converted by the Holy Ghost everything changed from there now that was just a simple experience it wasn't some big massive thing it doesn't have to be a big massive thing it doesn't have to be a big meeting or a glorious sermon or anything it doesn't have to be that it's just what does your heart say and I say that to my children often the Lord is listening to your heart more than your mouth he listens to what your heart is saying yeah that's what really matters that's why it's so important that our heart and our mouth say the same thing because the Lord is listening to the heart and it's so much better when our heart and our mouse is the same thing and it pleases the Lord amen it's very helpful and that's an prayer because you can cry louder in your heart than you came of your mouth if you try crying as that in your mouth as you can with your heart you will break your voice box yeah when you're crying to the Lord you're so desperate and you can't even say anything you can't talk and you say and that's when you think net scripture oh God may you interpret this you know because I can't say it it's so it's so burden on my heart or it's so deeply desirous to to to to to understand something or know something what to do next you know we need to know the captains will show us and sometimes you get into a state of desperation before the Lord Lord I can't I can't move another step without you showing me Lord it won't work I've done that before I've done my own steps and it didn't work and so I had to surrender everything yo and you come to a point where you say nah there's no more steps today it's my Andy and he doesn't take any of his own steps anymore my word is a light unto my feet and a lament of my path and lord I need a revelation of that I need to know what you want me to do which way you want me to go this Forks in the road this Forks in the road tonight this Forks on our road you know we can take a path and we just say Lord I'm here Laura at your will which way do I go old which is the way which is your perfect will hey man I'm gonna finish now if your musicians could come you know it's hard for me you know I had to pray a lot to come back to this because you get so much more and I've had some inspiration on other things and I really didn't know I felt like maybe I had a battle you know to find out whether the law wanted me to revisit this subject because there was other things coming and it was like do I go back to that and I very rarely go back to a subject and do a part two because you just there's the Lord's opening things up as you go and and and we're traveling right and you don't want to just you don't want to hold things back and stay there if it's moved on so you've got to kind of just move with the Lord but I I heard the Lord really lead me to carry on with this but I don't know whether I'll come back to this or not but so I'll just read get the burden can you play what's that song called everything's open just play that in I'll just read these things while it's playing it's in C amen and Zephaniah 3:17 says here the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee were singing I want to read this in the Bible basic English because you understand why this is here and that day it will be said to Jerusalem have no fear Ozai on hello Zion have no fear o Zion let not your hands be feeble the Lord your God is among you as a strong Savior he will be glad over you of joy he will make his love new again he will renew his love in your life maybe there's somebody here or on the state that needs to be renewed in their love now right where you're sitting right here you can be renewed in your love tonight because there's the power to change you and if you can relish his heart let him ravish your heart that means to your heart to be transported out of the condition that it may be in right now or your hearts in a good place how about a better place how about even more love you can't exhaust it you can't sit there and say I'm there nobody can sit there and say I've arrived because the moment you do that you start to die because we're on a journey and we got to get this more love there's more affection in Christ for him sit your affections on things above not on the things of the earth where moth and rust corrupt us but sit them on things about hallelujah the Lord will he will make his love new again he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast I will take away your troubles lifting up your shame from off you see at that time I will put an end to all who have been troubling you I will give salvation to her whose steps are uncertain I will and get-together her who has been sent and flight and I will make them a cause of praise and an honored name and all the earth when I let their fate be changed now remember he's speaking ultimately of Israel but you first inside you you are the Israel of God hey man you received this inheritance just before them and then they'll get it after when we go on the rapture hey man hallelujah and just finally the last thing I want to read [Music] this is the ultimate and absolute necessity that his love would be in our life season here 1 Kings 8 6 and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place into the Oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubims covered the ark with the staves thereof above and they drew out the states that the ends of the stage was seen out in the holy place before the Oracle and they were not seen without and there they are and to this day there was nothing in the ark safe the two tables of stone which Moses put there at horrible but when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to Minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God amen hallelujah did you notice that the glory didn't stay in the Holy of Holies but their glory and this is for you personalize it tonight there is if you haven't got that yet then the the Ark can come down now and till your lives into your heart into you - to such a degree amen to such a place that it wouldn't just stay there would permeate right out and those priests and those ministers stand for human effort human liturgy human order but there comes a time when human order won't stand anymore it won't work anymore because the love of God would come down so much all your complexes all your fears all of the troubles in your life is holding you back from your blessing your promise can be clouded by the love of God that would come down and so I believe the season for this is now I believe now I'm not going to go into all of it there's a huge prophetic background all of that to show you that it's right now maybe one day but now just remember this this you've got to pray according to the season and the season is now these things for her to happen where the love of God would come so thick and rich down into your life that would just take over until all your human effort will fall down and say God I can't even minister anymore it's not me I can't be a dad anymore Lord it needs to be you I can't be a mum like I should it's just got to be you Lord let the cloud come into my life he's the same all the things came into a lime and all the things you could say Israel fell in love was God and then all of a sudden the cloud came down and filled the temple it didn't just fill the Holy of Holies it went out into the whole temple and what happened you watch Israel received a golden age amen do you want a golden age in your life who was a golden age in their life who wants peace hey man you want peace from all the war well it's coming amen hallelujah coming now you can pray and season ask the Lord when it's all coming down and the Devils around you like a flood Lord when's your cloud coming down Lord come down Lord come and just come and consume my life for everything's open all these chains are broken is nothing evil holding me gone to your inheritance amen everything's open all these chains broken there's nothing evil holding me my prison was alive the devil I denied I'm freest I'm free to walk with God [Music] everywhere I look darkness was my [Music] everywhere I turn was nine but one day an angel and broken babies change but one day an angel came [Applause] ravit to me that everything's opened all these chains broken there's nothing Abel holding me my prison wants to lie the devil are denied oh I'm free yes I'm free to walk with God with every love broke my heart [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] why [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] all these things [Music] [Music] my prison Lord like Danny said if there's only one nugget to get here tonight law the crux of his message Lord is just to fall in love with you again and may we go and revisit that may we just go and and and regenerate that love Lord that that hunger fall for a agape love in our lives to our neighbor to our brother and sister to our son and daughter to our mum and dad Lord may we just have this all-encompassing love for everything and everyone may you lead us in that journey Lord because it is stuff Lord and thus flesh sometimes just does not want to go in that direction but lord have grace have mercy one last time Lord once more may we just push forward many we March as we some tonight and yes may we have safe traveling mercies Lord may be honest think upon your word be with us the rest of the week Lord encourage us Lord and strengthen us in this walk in this dark time this last time yes may you just be glorified in every which way in the law in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ our precious Savior
