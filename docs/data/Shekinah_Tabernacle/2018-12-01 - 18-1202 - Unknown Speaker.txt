word this morning if you have your sword with you let's go to Psalms 51 what start from verse 6 it is also a very prayerful scripture that David wrote and David was I can imagine David was deep into the spirit as it put pen to paper and usually when we go so far deep into the presence of the Lord or into that dimension we begin to speak to him in a very prayerful manner everything we do is to his worship alone we begin to outdoor him we begin to praise his name even an hour in our darkest moment and I also Brides this moment which reminds us that we are built to worship so David says here behold thou desirest thou desireth truth in the inward parts and in the hidden parts thou shalt make me no wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins O Lord and blot out all mine iniquities Lord created me a clean heart O God and renew a right

day we will be driving brother Andy yeah it's open should be often I mean who's happy hello yeah I saved that's right I made some glitches today I'm glad to be a Christian on you be wonderful every moment Amen guys sick and thank you brother Andy second Peter 1 vs. 10 down to 12 and I'm gonna look we're gonna go to Luke chapter 4 he says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ where for I will not be negligent to put you're always and remembrance of these things they even though you know them and be established in prison and the present truth a means let's go to Luke chapter 4 I'm gonna read verses 16 down to 21 and I know this is a familiar piece of scripture well I trust all the Scriptures familiar amen I trust you in the Bible you reading amen look for in 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sites of the blind so I had to see it at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him and he began to sound to them this day as the scripture fulfilled in your ears I mean my Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning I'd like to I want to go into a thought this morning about you know we read here in 2nd Peter about an entrance shall be an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now we know it's very easy if we look at the scripture you know it's been written over thousands of years through many different authors and and we understand that there's not a contradiction in it you know one would speak of another coming and then the other would prophesy future events and and and it is the revelation of God in in print form now it's very easy to look at prophecy and say you know things that are into the future and say that if you know that yes one day it will happen and it's very easy to say amen to that and you know anyone could agree like the scribes and Pharisees you know no doubt they you know and in the synagogue there and you know that that Jesus went where he go where he was raised up and he you know no doubt they had read that scripture from Isaiah many times and they no doubt would have discussed it and they no doubt would have debated about and had their opinion but it's very different to talk about the scripture in an intellectual way till when it becomes manifested in your day there's two very different things and so here it was now that the very one who gave the prophecy through Isaiah became flesh and he opened the book and he pointed in the book to what was being fulfilled in their day an hour and he just declared this day the scriptures fulfilled and they could actually see if they looked at what was happening in their day they could honestly say yes that is happening they know the blind have received this sight those that kept over being set free those who are bound I mean those that you know those are being bruised to be seen at Liberty this is this day if they really looked at it so the the battle always happens when the word is manna in your day that's where the contention that's where the controversy is that's where the battlers as when the scripture goes from just in the Bible to flesh that's where the battle happens that's where the debate will race and it's always when that happens is when the struggle happens because it's easier to say one day it'll happen but when it happens it's a very different thing now the Apostle Paul would say in Hebrews 10 speaking of the Lord Jesus and his sacrifice he says now having therefore brethren boldness entered the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil wishes to say his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God he says let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water now there came a day where we were Isaiah he prophesied behold a virgin shall conceive and that word was over the earth for hundreds of years and finally it became flesh and when Isaiah said he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we were healed that was released through the prophet Isaiah and it has circled the earth for hundreds of years then it became material amen where where it would go from the blood of bulls and goats and it would actually go to the plight of God Himself that would cleanse of people and so when the Apostle Paul was saying that we have a new and living way this was controversial in his day right this was controversial because it was a prophecy but now the prophecy had happened and it was now actually in the past and he was telling these Hebrews that it's not the blood of bulls and goats it's the blood of God that was shed upon the earth which is greater than the blood of bulls and goats you know it has more power it can actually change the inner man amen take that sinful nature that you're born with it and take it from you give you a new spirit and then not just early and use prepa then the Spirit of God comes and dwells in you a new and living way hallelujah now whenever whenever a a something happens in the scripture it's by the Word of God as we and I will come to second Peter but we understand that a tenant if an entrance is ministered that that entrance is ministered by the Word of God yes whenever the word is preached it actually creates an opening for people to go through into a new place so for example Moses you know there was a prophecy that Israel would be in Egypt for hundred years they'd be slaves in a deliverer would come and he would and God would through that deliverer would bring them out with a mighty hand and they would return to the promised land so here was now that prophecy was there it was a prophecy no doubt they talked about a lot but then Moses came and God fulfilled his word God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and then so Moses came and then he began and then they went to Mount Sinai and God gave him the Lord he preached the law to the people and those that received it by faith had created an entrance that they could go into the promised land yes right so it wasn't just saying to talk about anymore it was happening right so those who receive the word by faith I mean in their day it actually created an entrance and they walk through Caleb and Joshua they received that word the others heard the word they doubted Caleb and Joshua I believe that let's go take it they did because it created interest Linda going to the promised land yes hallelujah so it's always the it's always the word that cracks an opening for people to go and you take for example Peter was given the keys to the kingdom you know Jesus asked when Matthew 16 who to mean say that I am and they said some say you're a liar or Jeremias or one of the prophets but Jesus I said who do you say that I am and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Peter and Jesus said to Peter blessed art thou simon barjona also son of Jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father which in turn even has revealed this so the conversations on revelation what's been revealed to the people while you're a prophet you're Elijah Jeremias or one of the prophets but then Jesus is who do you say that I am who do you say living word is right and then so Peter said you're the Christ so it was revealed to Peter you are you are the Christ Jesus is the Christ and so Jesus saying upon this rock right not upon Peter the church is not built upon Peter Amen the church is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ is not who he was we can all talk about who he was but he's the Living Word in this day he's in Corinthians we know we no longer know him after the flesh we don't know him after the crumpled flesh we know I'm after his word that's how we know and last Sunday I was talking about the power of decision and when you see that would have God manifested in your day you should decide that's God and go with it that's how you make the true decision I mean so now sir upon the upon the revelation of who Jesus is the church is built upon and then so when Jesus said that the Peter says and I'll give to you the keys of the kingdom what you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven what you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven this is wounded so now how did Peter use the keys yes never come to the day of Pentecost and then the Holy Ghost comes down hallelujah and he's still falling today amen and then they've come out of the Upper Room acting like a bunch of drunk people but a bunch of dead tombstones living stones rejoicing hallelujah the promise of Joel the manifestations of prophecy being they were rejoicing and the people saw these people are drunk and Peter says up we're not drunk as he supposed but being the third day of the day but this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel that a puller pour his spirit out upon all flesh anything to tell how those wicked people those religious people crucified the Living Word for their day and that pricked in their hearts I said men and brethren what shall we do to be saved he said he's going to use the keys now he gets the keys out and he puts it in the doors he's repent and be baptized everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shout well I promise says unto you children as a pharaoh in his middles Lord our God shall call it so his word that he preached open the door they created an entrance into the kingdom hallelujah who's walked through that door Oh hallelujah Amen cuz we know Jesus jesus said I am the door to the Sheep fault he is the word right he is the worst so when the word comes open word manifest it creates an entrance that's why you got a when you hear the word receive it so that's for me there's no matter what commission you find yourself and you say Lord that's mine that's mine no creighton effect in your life it'll change you hallelujah but the devil loves to poke down unbelief some people start say oh you don't understand his love for you and he puts you in a cage get out of the cage I'd rather walk with God than walk with Satan that's for sure hallelujah now so now here we are an entrance was ministered and we know that Peter used the keys for the Jews the Gentiles and the Samaritans all different races or classes of people upon the earth and the kingdom was open the same way and it still was open that way to us hallelujah now in every age God sends his word upon the earth that's not a contradiction of Scripture it's the manifestation of that scripture yes and every in every age those that receive the word for their age are the children of the kingdom brother brems would say in the scene of discrepancy if you want to go those dimensions go listen to that 1965 now we've lived through Luther's age Wesley's age the Methodists age all the way down through the ages and the Pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifests that promise word is the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children as those seed of the kingdom at that age hallelujah so those who really receive the word for their day and God manifests that them they are the children of the law amen but those who do not amen are the seed of discrepancy right so Caleb manifested the promised word for his age he received Moses word and he knew that word wasn't for them to a debate about in the wilderness but to go take the promised land and he took his resurrection Mountain right but Korra and Dyson were the seeds of discrepancy they heard the same preaching they they they saw the same miracles and but they but they tried to usurp Moses Authority and the earth swallowed them up amen so now we are living in a day now I want to go into this just we're going to go into a bit of a teaching Mowgli now Daniel saw an image maybe I'll just put the image up and then we'll read all that now can everyone see that now King Nebuchadnezzar this is in Daniel chapter 2 King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and he saw an image like this image where and we can read that let's go to Daniel chapter 2 either I'll keep that up there we'll read it or maybe maybe we won't because it's been your so Daniel 2 and 31 because what I want to show you because Peter said and you know what we read there in 2nd Peter he sees an entrance shall be ministered unto you so he's talking of a future time right so he's not talking now we know that they eat it into the kingdom because they received the Holy Ghost but Peter is actually speaking of another entrance being ministered and I wanted that's what I want to get into because if he was actually talking of receiving the Holy Ghost then in order to be ministered right that entrance but now the entrance he's speaking on is that as the rapture as the people that are alive and remain in the change of their body ok this is where I'm going if you're honoring what is this all about ok so so he sees an entrance shall be ministered it goes to speaking of something that will happen in the future so here we are now with Daniel I just want to show this here it is in Daniel and we're in Daniel 2 from verse 31 he says O king so so Daniel is now telling the King what his dream means now our King source and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this images hid was made of gold his breast and arms of silver his belly and thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron part of clay till thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon the feet that ravine and clay and break them to pieces he says then then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away and no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king they were king are a king of kings for God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and we're so ever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field the fowls of heaven shall be given to thine hand and had made the Aurora of them all thou art this head of gold now he comes interpretation remember we saw an image it of goals at that so daniel saying here beacon is your kingdom as the heat of the Simmins right and another of thee shall arise another Kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and suggest all things and as iron that breaketh all these it shall break in pieces and bruise hmm so notice the you know the Middle's described they get harder but less value right this is the Spirit coming down now and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part potters clay and part and the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it strength of iron for as much as our source the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seeds of seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings this is coming down to the end right these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the Kingdom shall not be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou Saurus that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and it that had break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the Great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure can a man so now here's the image so so what it is now is this is the world powers to the time of the year so Nebuchadnezzar's kingdoms the head of gold and then after that the Medes and Persians took over the kingdom of didd bikinis up this is history and in the Greeks took over the Medes and Persians and this is all in the book of daniel as well but I'm just I'm just taking this part of it right and then the Roman Empire conquered the Greeks yeah and then now the Roman Empire that spirit works all the way from a word from Roman Empire that collapse they went to papal Rome and that's and and there was a division the two legs of the of the Great Schism and the Orthodox Church which yard is the Roman Catholic then there's the Eastern Orthodox and that goes all the way down to the time of the end yes that spirit conquers the world and there's and it's and it's iron and clay and the feet partially strong partially divided and as brother Isaac preached so well this is where we are and it's falling apart yes the world has fallen apart right so now so I want to show you this because it's when the image so when the kingdoms come down to the time of the end that's when the stone demon cut out of the mountain without hands comes and smites the image in the feet and all of this has crashed down to powder like the threshing floor and scattered but it's destroyed and then at this time the kingdom of God is established upon the earth right just not when the heat of gold is here it's not even when the Greeks are here or yo it's not even when the Romans are here at the beginning but it's at the feet as when the kingdom of Goddess is coming to take over we're living here if you're wondering that's why this world is falling apart that's why this world has fallen apart that's why there's no answers that's why this world is broken yes because it's iron and clay and though this it's not very strong they have all these big summits they shake hands they pretend to be friends yeah secretly they try to destroy each other yes and the world was looking at another war which the book of Revelation said there'd be three woes is the second war first the second world war is a third world it's going to happen but in the between time a people have called out amen our people have pulled out from the earth for a message goes out and try right and it finds the predestinated and it gathers them rolls them up hallelujah Emily heaven amen and in the whoa heaven amen oh yeah thank you like you take me you take World War two it was an amateur tribulation amateur tribulation I don't know how many hundred kids and millions of people died yeah I may get the figure wrong but the Russians from going from I think Stalingrad or before that to Berlin they lost ten men per meter something like that some astronomical figure of people of blood shed upon the Earth to to invade Nazi Germany something astronomical and that was just military what about the civilian you go look at the figures has anyone looked at it if I'm gone you go just Wikipedia World War two look at the estimated casualty rate and the civilian death and you look at those figures and every person is alive and they had ambitions and they had family they had loved ones they just like you and I but we look at a screen assistance statistic and we let it cut up you know we just kind of it passes over our head because we can't put that amount of people in our mind and that's an amateur tribulation but we're not called to go into an amateur tribulus I mean we're not called to go into the Great Tribulation that's why this word came yes an entrance shall be ministered unto a man and I can say this is me you can say well you just a bit crazy I say that's happened it's happened we're not looking it's happened yes we've received it amen right oh yeah hallelujah we've received it now in so and then there's also exceed you can take it you take it real simple go down to Abraham's day there was lot that says in the New Testament that the that the son of Gomorrah Victor's righteous soul but he couldn't actually fix it right he was he was vexed he couldn't fix it you see Christendom in the world they're vexed they want to make the world Christian again but they can't do it that's right unfortunately that's how they are and I'm glad they're Vic someone should be mixed we should be me we should sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city but the same time rejoice because we're good at stick it out in this place the Lord's crowded an entrance for us to walk through we should all look gather your children I don't want to see a single one good go into the Great Tribulation if I had my way when the devil turns up he'd say where's everyone gone Amen oh yeah that's how I feel do you agree in that way amen but you know I just rejoiced if you've been cold something in you says yes yes and he's transformed you by his word I just be happy just rejoice and they say Lord it's gonna be more than just this for no more let's Bible this phone there's got to be many many more probably where they out leader and that's why I rejoice what's happening in Ethiopia Amen hallelujah send the fire Lord Amen why not here why yeah why not here hallelujah River we up amen amen so this is happening unfortunately this is happening and it's very it's very clear there's going to be a war there's no super - super tatsu time I don't read dr. Seuss enough super powers cannot exist at the same time they can't there has to one has to go and one has to remain even just in the natural process of of history it has to be that way and we know who is China and this and is Russia and this and there's the United States and Europe and Europe's broken yes you know and as and we have this kind of mentality or we're on the back corner of the you know the south end of the Pacific we're far away we're not far away we know we'll just ride this out we won't ride this out the only hope is the coming of the Lord that's the only hope we have is the rapture right in we are will survive this country will be annihilated yes right this is just me you know it's like Pilate tried to wash his hands of Jesus's blood he didn't do it he tried to awesome Barkley oh no I find no fault in this man he was the supreme judge of the place he has their Roman legions they widened he actually back up what he said he's trying to pass the buck you can't pass the buck you got say it's someone else's fault this is the way my upbringing or the pressure of life or measure of school whatever more I'll wash my hands of it I'll get by you can't do it man yeah I wouldn't even try if I was you I just say Lord take the blood put on my hey man I need cleansing wash where you make me clean amen - that's that's how I'd be Oulu you so now this is where we are so these catch - come a time and we're living in this time as everyone on the same page the whole world knows that there's going to be Armageddon's here yes Oh coming people prick Preppers you know they try God in the mountain someplace they'll say yeah and they think they'll survive I wouldn't print that kind of way amen my faith is in the wood of God races and they which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep I mean but the dead in Christ rise first and let me tell alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air amen now let's let's just go to that scripture so I don't have this on the glory on the PowerPoint but you know we are living in the greatest day this is the greatest name all the earth a mess hallelujah we're a where the final enemy death will be put under the feet of the bride and we're gonna walk out of this place alive amen hallelujah you know God is very or well it's just it's just um let's go there first Thessalonians 4 maybe I'll just take that off but as if I'm with me this is the time where the everlasting kingdom of God is going to be established upon the earth by military mind Jesus right it's not on conquering countries and all we make in Christian know it's God establishing the kingdom in your heart Amen that's right and then when everyone he's predestinated that that happens when they all the predator was become one with him the Living Word then he takes them into the wedding supper and we have the wedding supper and then there's the great Armageddon whatever more there's the Millenium Amen hallelujah now 1st Thessalonians 4 and let's read from verse 13 you know a lot of you know all the scripture actually speaks of today you know all the speak scripture speaks of today yes it's not just history that's right it speaks of today yes that's why you go through the Gospels you see what the son of man did and that day he does it today yes you see the book of Acts well the way I'm said that if the if the branch yo you know if the vine ever puts forth another branch it will produce another book max it'll write a book of acts behind it yes and that's just not nice language he's declaring though when God puts for the people they will produce the life you see in the book of Acts and what you see in the book of Acts will come right and not just signs wonders and healing but false brethren will come and try and take them to a former age yes that's right right the enemy will try to come in and kill the effect of the words right all those things you know you can read the book of Acts and when you read it you actually say yeah this is the story of my life amen this is the summary the believers repeating all regardless this alone Ian's 4 verse 13 but I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise right then they were then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord comfort one another with these words now many times we stop reading but we've got to keep reading but but of the times and seasons so that word but is going to tie in what we've just read to what we're about to read it's one whole piece of scripture right but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day the Lord so cometh as a thief from the night who's going to come as a thief and he's the best thief a man he doesn't leave fingerprints amen only it takes a while for the police to catch up to him because they'll realize with God yeah I'm talking about the world where I'm in the police right understand then they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them have travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that they should overtake you as a thief for year all children of the light and children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night let but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet of the hope of salvation hope and the Bible's expectation right for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ right so he's saying very clearly the day is going to come as a thief but you know it in darkness you know perfectly right so this is not going to catch us unawares right the yo the bright around the world is not going to be surprised when they did in Christ rise the brighter the bright around the world is not going to be surprised when these bodies are changed right because we've been expecting it when yo when the dead in Christ race we should say I've been expecting you I've been waiting for you to come and here you are finally amen but now we know the Lord this does three things as he descends he deceives with a shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God and then the dead in Christ will rise first and brother Brahim says very clearly the shout is the message it's a word going forth to gather a people to become one with Christ the Living Word yes right there's what the shout is so the shout has come right it's already here we're living in a resurrection hour amen I mean you ought to realize you say always the resurrection this should be something and you say I am the resurrection because I was once dead but now I'm alive I have been quickened by the Spirit of the Living God hallelujah by his word I'll be made alive in the cell right to manifest the promise of the cell which is the rapture the translation of the Living Brian I mean with the resurrected Saints glory hallelujah so now we know we have to come to a conclusion we're not in darkness you know well I'm saying we should be happy that or other Craig they ought to make you happy amen right we're not in darkness but we're in life that they will not overtake us like a thief but it's not going to pass by the believer he's going to make sure your you know how Lou you just like when he arose he walk with the two on the way to Emmaus they weren't exactly sure who it was and he began to open the word open the worse started at Moses we through all the prophecies we're through the Psalms the types in the shadow six hours a meet of a sermon of fulfilled prophecy in the end day what they had witnessed but they didn't quite catch it he was walking with them to make sure they didn't miss it that they were catching and that's why God is so so so what he caught pose and also directed he's so burdened he has a great desire that it doesn't pass you by that does message is more than healing or visions but it's of Jesus Christ manifest is worth I mean here's this word that it has come to this age to quicken you make you alive that you would understand you're part of the resurrection no I meant amen I don't know how more clear I'll come back that's why when you read this I trust you read this when you hear the message something speaks to you yes it's more than just learning and anchors in your soul so maybe you can see it change your life yes hallelujah what's happening the Son of Man is walking with you say now this is where you are this is me this is you yes thank you this is where you are this is me this is you hallelujah right thank you listen to the Book of Ruth it's more than a love story needs more than just a nice you know there's a reason it's put in there hallelujah and any goes this is your Ruth I'm boy's brother Brandon ministry amen but you are rose and I'm Bo and I've come to redeem you and you're no longer a winner with nothing I mean Jesus Christ you're mrs. Boaz mighty Manilow well hallelujah and then you better juice alive Ruth Ruth produces child a man-child hallelujah amen she wasn't just engaged I mean a win from an engagement I mean finally she became married hallelujah that she wasn't a Moabite anymore she was part of the economy of Israel part of God's brother be our amen and she produced the Sun hallelujah and the Bride of Christ has more than gifts has more than gifts from her from her fiance she becomes married and she loses a child she matures the life hallelujah the life of the word that's what the brain does I mean that's why we can you know you know especially the firstborn man they're just clones boy your girl you say I know where you came from hallelujah the mat right even while all of them you know there's a stamp but especially the firstborn you can see well we know where they want Rudy so what's created in the child is in the father right and it's the same the life that you produce I mean you should be able to look into the scripture of God that your life is how you this is how you are this is your characters as I see what you do and you should build a hopeless life say yes it's your life oh god it's not some hybrid church systems life something for murder it's a living word on display law hallelujah amen amen I'm glad I mean that ought to make you happy jelly and it is that God would gather you wherever you're from it's irrelevant that's why I like it God gets a whole bunch of different kind of people doesn't matter will they forget it's where they ain't I think this Godhead this mind I see you around my throat I see the New Jerusalem and then he's already got his mind I know how to get them there brother Graham said that God took a photo of you before the foundation of the world that your very best put it in his album and now he's determined what they the image I saw they will be hallelujah I mean that's why we just garden from this negative to positive maybe that's why I trust you can look back in your life and you're going from glory to glory hey what do you once were you no longer are because you're becoming more like him not knowing from death to death the destruction but you're going up holy you say well how can God's would do that I said in the very beginning I love it haiman God cried heavens and earth period hmm oh let's read that let's go to Genesis 1 and 2 amen sits in the earth the earth was without form and void this is 1 and 2 and darkness was upon the face of the deep but this is what makes the difference and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters [Music] so it was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters and then what did he do and in verse 3 and God said let there be light and there was light God brooded over the surf and the darkness and the chaos it was then he began to speak there's more than just being anointed it was more than just the earth being anointed God spoken to that earth Amen that's it hallelujah and when he finished speaking it wasn't you know it wasn't without form and void and darkness covering it it was with form it wasn't void and light covenant and there were mountains and hills and valleys and oceans and different things in paradise Eden was there and beneath were there in their place all of crashing was how God said because God spoke name and God when he finished speaking it was perfect amen hallelujah and now but then when corruption sits in it goes back into a chaos yes right so when the word is received in faith it produces Eden amen right yes that's why this world is falling apart because they rejected the message at the same time right if they received it we would have had a millennium already yes but they rejected it Israel received Solomon they had like a millennium all the neighbors had peace right the early part of Solomon's reign and was all peace and harmony because they received the gift that came to the earth and if the if the world just would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost according to the word right receive the real gift in then there would be peace and harmony among nations but now this chaos so now you take so God brooded over the earth and spoke and took chaos and brought it into paradise now when sickness comes in when when when cancer comes and let's just read this is from the law having a shadow now that little germ then cold and the mothers in the incubator while it comes it begins to develop that one cell spreads out develops another cell another cell another cell and every seed will bring forth of its kind a dog a dog a bird a bird a man a man same thing now that's where you come from but where did cancer come from it's a big growth to its developing cells started from a germ but with that germ come from I mean sees it is that tumor cataract any other germ diseases demons that's exactly Jesus says I have powder cast out Devils in his name that's exactly the gospel brother the gospel came through demonstration of the holy spirit notice down the germ between God when Christ was in the womb of Mary you're just a little teeny germ before it was a germ but what's after the gym it's a life then you're in the supernatural you're in the sixth dimension you're plumb out of human reasoning into spirit life every little germ has a life that life came from somewhere the life of a cancer came from the devil your life came from God that's the difference so he also says in one place a cell gets bruised he sees at backslides and then the demon gets into that sell because the brute produced cancer out of that cell so when when the devil comes he takes order right these bodies should be working yes right if they're in perfect health that's order right but then the devil comes in and he turns that order into chaos it turns that order into chaos so now you just take that in the physical way but then and then what happens now as if cancers in someone and they have faith in the promise of God and they believe then the life is taken out of that right taken out of the cancer then the body's got to purify get rid of the cells right if its internal vis external or can fall off right but then what happens now and that's in the physical but in the spiritual God wants us to be in order right order with his word one with his word so we hear his word it creates an entrance it takes us from chaos into order amen right so faith in his word will produce that I mean that's why you you know I trust you can look back and say what happened what caused me to become this way it's because you received faith and you believed this word and it made you change into the creature that you are I mean it's a law of faith because maybe the word will produce the promise of the work I mean but then if you take unbelief and the word will produce chaos right and that's where unbelief comes in I mean a demon spirit comes in and it takes a person from order and takes them into chaos destroy yes just like Legion he was once a normal person he was once a normal job logs Jared blogs it no Israelite on the street normal person it something happened to him yes and the devil got ahold of him and it took him from order and to chaos on the tubes filled with Legion demons but then Jesus came that's why you see something pulling you down into darkness I wouldn't stop I wouldn't let it thank you I'll see with us guys I'm looking for deeper I'm looking for a way to survive this world just get into Christ in this world it's no more than survival of a cow hallelujah then Jesus came I mean in the and and Legion gets amazing Legion comes and worships yes so just because someone begins to shout they can just be a demon shout I maybe put a bit of a thing in there maybe think about it because you look at the life that comes after Legion worship he got emotional he cried out but there wasn't enough the demons had to be cast out demons had to be cast out and that's when the demons were cast out then the end Legion was free I think the problem is what what people do you know the Bible that speaks about a City of Refuge who knows what I'm talking about in Israel they had six cities around Israel and if someone killed someone accidentally they could flee into the city or even if they don't purpose they could flee into the city and in a way to a time where their case could be hurt and if they did it premeditatedly W dragged out and killed without mercy but that on accident and they and their appeal was accepted they could go out free city of refuge so that city could hide the worst murderer in the world you following me good but until the Avenger of blood came and that person was dragged out and killed then that was dealt with you know people are cities of refuge for the devil yeah you think about this thing the devil hides the devil doesn't like to be exposed the only way you can expose them is not just say I have a problem you got to actually say what it is yes you're actually voice up for what it is God you say well I'm struggling with something what was something the devil will hide behind the something following me brother man this way city see this way you should see how people he sees in the church Facebook I don't I don't have it on me he says you should look at the people's faces when they come in the prayer line and the devil actually knows he's about to be exposed and that's why the weather's are powerful in this age because the devil has no hiding place he can hide from the doctor take it honey the psychologist but he can't hide from the Word of God I mean goodness the greatest torch-lite disease ever beam is shining in this thing holy the thing is you've got to give him up you're gonna give up you to give the devil over you've got hide them you can't be a refuge for Satan don't make me a Remus I mean you have you pull the Avenger of blood his head Jesus Christ you think God doesn't avenge his elect hallelujah do you think he just has his hands tied and sympathizes with you I'm sorry that that happened I'm sorry the devil did that to you isn't that a shame but one day we'll clear it up though we'll clear it up today and then the parable of the unjust judge he says you know that you're the woman came to the judge cried out avenge me of injury and the man gets the other judge gets tied he says well I don't fear God or man but because this woman's basically nagging me to death I'm going to do something about it and and God and Jesus says you know isn't the Lord greater than that I'm just judged and he is quick to avenge the has elected the crowd and not before I mean he will avenge them speedily I'm not talking about flesh and blood now you understand we have a we're not fighting people were fighting demon power right so now that's why it's so important he's our Avenger I mean because we cannot save one another we cannot deliver one another we can't even humanly help one another it takes him to count it take you stronger to come and help and he is stronger than them all I mean that's why you know the Avenger of blood is here put up with her my friends in the world only liked me because I was doing what they did as soon as the Lord was dealing with me and I surrendered to him they were my friends no more what kind of friend will stand with you only when you do the same thing if they were really my friends that still be my friend and they leave me I didn't leave this story you Paula Williams I didn't have to I meant to say I'm gonna cut these people out of my life they read I didn't say a word I thought I said it before what am i best drinking buddies in first year uni we really cut it up he is after that we're still at university I become a believer I don't tell them anything about it I see him in the supermarket down there a big Bush and count down a waiter for Darren Christ's youth and and it's like II yeah I saw we barely know each other how are you good you see the look on his face I don't want to be near you another secret I didn't say anything about the Lord anything and off eWEEK they will leave you you don't need to worry about all you know they will leave you and but if there's really my friend we still would have been friends yeah hey following me I mean why be someone's friend just because of such thing yeah I think the other you know the greatest friend you need is Jesus crying he will never make you look stupid yeah he will never know you know make you think you're worthless he'll do the opposite values he'll know that he's your breasts your Lord is your best friend a man it's knowing new kids like Jesus oh there's no one who understands like him Lori I know but the devil just puts a big cage over say God he doesn't care about you if it really did he would have seen to whatever more and you know and then the evil paints this picture and we believe the picture you're the problem as we think too much actually we listen too much I mean you know we should put a business hours of clothes Satan shut up problem as he speaks in your voice and he uses your emotions against you and he beats you around and India and he paints this picture all these people of this way you know if I listen you know that's it yeah that's the problem the devil sees all you know he said oh our man doesn't like you and then he would and see he just did this and see just adversity and he and he gives all this evidence he's the biggest fabricating law but if I believe his life yeah I saw he doesn't like me anymore I wonder what happened yeah well maybe I just got a distance myself you know and so if I go down this way then in reality we're still friends and our mother boy thinking what's what's up with beat that was a funny joke what's wrong but you know but the thing is if I listen to the devil and but I take ownership of those thoughts all we need a holy man's filter the Holy Ghost and our mind they're really filter is that God's thoughts on the devil saw the devil will never give me the word you'll give you maybe a lot of the wood but not the whole church I mean and the thing is you know what you just look go watch some Safari nature video what are the Lions do they go for the young and they try and scatter them out they try and separate them from the herd always and then the devil comes along and not talking about age dishes hair Lee here but what does he do separates us out well I just you know I need to see a pro and and and the first thing people don't come here fellowship anymore you know oh yeah I just you know and then they see it bred themselves out it's like a cold coming out of the fire once it was white hot burning yeah he doesn't take to it just a small distance and now it begins to cool down and there's no more heat what happens at move yeah what moved it it wasn't itself that's right are we here don't wanna you know we don't want to be separated from the hook who put that video somewhere that that zebra mum that was glorious I lied to shout it I love there so there's this baby zebra and this lion grabs it and it's going to kill it and then so the zebra the mum I think as the moment you know this you know this is shot and you see the line it's got to by the throat or something it's gonna kill the baby in the in the mum just comes in but it comes up with a teeth widen the head lady and she gets between the baby the line gives him a kick a man ran off yeah she would have been scared all this is the lion you know but you see she's got a teeth out oh oh wish I had anyone you guys are like just say this is this is the zebra this is the lion's mouth around it and you get your teeth bite right in like this hallelujah I mean let's kill someone that's my kinda zebra god bless that mom Polly she's a real mum didn't cow back all your they don't understand and you know whatever more none she stood on the word this is my child I mean if we had half the gumption that that zipper did I'll tell you what hallelujah you know if a zebra just out of nature can try and you know save its baby how much more the Bride of Christ they're going to put the word supernatural armor on caught in the hand that's why we shouldn't care for nothing I'm not here to Kerala no retreat there's no armor on the back of a Christian when I'm called to retreat we'll go back probably to take every divine promise I mean if an agent has been ministered unto us hallelujah well it's been so long Moses was ad on the backside the desert who's over 80 here yeah I mean here god bless you Rebecca I'm glad you're listening hallelujah no one's 80 here oh it's been a long time I've been in this situation a long time that's a long time Moses was a long time right I think okay hey okay yes that's a big difference you know we need to stop looking at well it's always been this way no the world has always been this way who cares about always being the slaves bonus for today the scripture says today's the day of salvation the promises today it's not off someplace amen amen hallelujah amen that's how we should be glory to God hallelujah now where are we oh yeah brother Brown speaks a lot about turning corners and you can see in even even in Jesus's day I'm sure you can agree they turn some corners they had the law they had their scribes and Pharisees the high priests the temple the sacrifices they don't have too few short years they had they had totally moved on God had moved on sadi synagogues I had the temple they had the high priests they had the free stone all these things that was God all day but then he comes John he says behold the kingdom of God is at hand a corner was being turned right he preached the King would repent for the kingdom of God is at hand and he points out the Messiah they just turned a corner and then now here is the the Lamb of God is on the grounds to be given the one that the bulls and goats are pointing to was there yeah oh there's a quarter being turn hallelujah and then Jesus came for this cause I've come to the world gives us blood on Calvary by one offering he's perfected for them for everything that are sanctified and then when his blood was shed the lamb and the temple didn't do any good because a quarter was to and the people had to turn a corner and then their Pentecost came God pulled out his Holy Ghost hallelujah and then now there's still people who are still back with John and and Paul makes them a pulse and in the upper coast of Ephesus X 1819 and a pulse is preaching from the scripture that Jesus is the Christ proving it he's a believer but only knew the baptism of John he was back a bit he had to come forward right so now here comes Paul aney and he says well have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed not when you believe but since right and then a Paul says I'm honest he says I don't know if there be any Holy Ghost well how are you baptized he said I received John's baptism and Paul said that was good but God stood the corner right God's moved on and he said i baptize name of Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost came upon them so they came up to where God was but there's a quarter turn right and now that's the big problem as brother Graham says it's easy to build a wall right just just plow on in the same away but when it comes to the corner turning yes that's the dangerous but right man is very good at building walls but turning corners it can be difficult and there's a you know the church came out of the Dark Ages Luther the just shall live by faith there was a corner turned in Wesley came with a second work of grace you know being sanctified a corner was turned right in the Pentecostals with the gifts the corner was to be following me yeah and then the ministry of Malachi for came to the earth that was a corner big because Jesus Christ the wood was now introduced to the people yes right as John John's ministry introduced Jesus Christ the first time the minister brother Behrman choose Jesus Christ the word to the people right so that was a corner being turned and then if you go through his ministry says you know we're turning a corner but then he comes down to leadership at 1965 well the last services he preaches he is now what life Luther had was justification weasely had sanctification added to it the Pentecostal had the restoration of the gifts coming back in added to it but now it's completing in the body you see these three phases of it out of that now when the resurrection comes the life that lived in them Lutheran's that went out the life that lived and the Methodists went out the life that was in the Pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground in the body of the bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ glory to be God glory to God oh it's exciting as the truth he says we've turned a corner we're looking towards heaven watching for the coming the kept on the pyramid as we would say his coming back the church must be resurrected soon we must get ready so he says we've turned a corner amen and we're looking towards heaven so there's no more station to go to right but our next destination is heaven hallelujah your destination is right ahead of you amen hallelujah so what it's not turn here take seeking right here 30 exit here's nothing your destination is right ahead of you yes hallelujah in order for that image to be here I mean a a an entrance s three ministers of the everlasting kingdom and this word has because when God as you said on Wednesday just a little bit sees in Hebrews 1 that he upholds all things by the word of his power right so when God releases his word releases a power in that word right it gives you power you say well how's that so well if you receive the word you're a sinner in the world or just some kid religious person on a Pew and you receivers word by faith it gave you power above sin right it gave you power above the habits of the world well once you maybe drug smoke the drugs Ramnath woman whatever more then you receive the word in faith it gave you power that that thing no longer controlled your name it was under your feet yes right because the word released a power and you received it and then you released and then you continue receiving word and that word sanctifies you yes hallelujah it gives you a new nature right fills you with the Holy Ghost amen you receive the divine nature only now so whenever God releases his word it releases a power and that's why it's so important this day I mean that when we go to revelations 10 we're seven thunders uttered their voices john was sold don't write it down it's not for you it's for a future people it's right and then now it's no longer a thunder it's a voice yes and brother Graham said when the seals come open it's not a different book yes right it's not people actually did that it's saying well with your with your ministry in the way God speaks you could write another Bible says no no it's all in the scripture right it's all there just has to be revealed and then right it's all sitting there it just has to come open I mean you say well how can that be well let me ask you something who's read through this book then it all become clear to you the first time how about the second time it becomes more clear to you as you read it but it's all there right it doesn't you know God didn't suddenly seen an angel ah there's another chapter here now I can read this and this comes open no it's all here yeah but the 1st or 2nd 3rd 4th haven't you know you can read through it so I never saw that before but you've read it before right but it has to come open to you yes Alleluia is wasting it's like that's why the ministry Mel powerful was that the word would come open I wear things where people would say how does this all mean and Victor is it this is what it means in your oh well that's easy well I was I losing hear about this but with man it's always that way but God makes his words like Amen let's uh let's let's read a psalm together bull clothes let's go to Psalm 145 if I'd understand though we received an entrance it's been ministered to us this word has ministered to you an entrance is the everlasting Kingdom into the rapture hallelu amen amen I'm glad some 145 we just gonna read the whole thing cause it's wonderful amen he says I will say I mean when you're there you say I mean when you're there okay good look I will exalt thee my god o King I will bless thy name forever and ever every day will I bless thee and I'll praise thy name for ever and ever great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and our by wondrous words and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and I will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of our righteousness the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works all thy works shall praise thee O Lord and my Saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk about our to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion and juror throughout all generations the lord upholdeth all that fall and rise up all those that be bowed down the eyes of all wait upon me and now give us them their meat in due season now open us thy hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing the Lord is righteous in all his ways and holy and all his works the LORD hath nigh and to all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth hallelujah he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry I will save them amen the Lord preserveth all them that love him but
