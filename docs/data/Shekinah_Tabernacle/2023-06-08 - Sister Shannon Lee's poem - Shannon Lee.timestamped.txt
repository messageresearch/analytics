[0:00] if I ever seen a sorrowful sight in all
[0:03] my 20 years of battle and fights is a
[0:06] complainer so simple no plainer a
[0:08] complainer
[0:09] but did you know I bet you didn't
[0:11] because it may not show a complainer is
[0:14] not a complainer without a one-eyed
[0:17] six-leg Wally Winder that's right
[0:20] what a terrible sight what a frightful
[0:23] fright a complainer is just a person a
[0:25] people a peep walking life's journey
[0:28] prepared or asleep and then boom
[0:31] something happens something out of the
[0:33] ordinary something goes wrong and the
[0:36] first thing you know here comes the
[0:39] Wally wonder which is six legs long
[0:42] its legs wave about with fear dismay and
[0:46] doubt its tentacles try to attack with
[0:49] sections of a pending doom and it
[0:51] attacks
[0:52] oh my only oh no
[0:56] let me see if I can get this nice
[1:03] the Wally Winder has suctioned the
[1:06] eye
[1:07] see see all is falling all is failing
[1:11] surely this is your doom this is your
[1:13] fate how could God let you get to this
[1:16] state
[1:18] Oh Me Oh My
[1:21] the second thing you know the Wally
[1:23] World winter has suctioned the brain
[1:26] oh the humiliation oh the shame you
[1:30] didn't want this why is this happening
[1:33] who's the culprit who's to blame
[1:38] Oh Me Oh My
[1:40] oh my third thing you know the Wally
[1:43] has suctioned the arms you're too weak
[1:48] too weary to warn don't raise your hands
[1:51] just be downcast beaten forlorn
[1:56] Oh Me Oh My Oh no
[2:02] now the feet
[2:05] I turn the page sorry
[2:07] the wallywag winter has wrapped the feet
[2:10] to stop the person in their tracks
[2:12] rendering them immovable unfruitful it
[2:16] attacks from moving forward pressing on
[2:19] the Wally Winder has nearly one then
[2:22] then oh no oh me oh my oh no
[2:30] the mouth the wallywag winter goes for
[2:33] the tongue to make confession to make
[2:36] profession of what they believe of what
[2:39] they'll receive all or what they'll be
[2:41] come but wait
[2:45] don't give up it's not too late this is
[2:48] not your doom this is not your fate
[2:50] don't be crowned a complainer a mega
[2:53] moaner a wally-wall winter
[2:56] just believe
[2:59] all things are possible all things work
[3:01] together for the good that love the Lord
[3:04] we are more than conquerors what can
[3:06] separate us fight him by Praise
[3:10] bite him by testimony smack him by song
[3:14] Whack Him by dance kick him by Joy
[3:18] sorry sicken by faith
[3:22] good job babes
[3:27] you did it ends up in the air you won
[3:31] [Applause]
[3:35] now
[3:37] now you can speak now you can move now
[3:40] you can think now you can see now you've
[3:42] got your Victory
[3:45] and if the one-eyed six-legged Wally
[3:49] Winder comes crawling creeping sneaking
[3:52] back when another one of life's trials
[3:55] changes rearranges comes
[3:58] you comes to you along the way don't
[4:01] give him don't give him the time of day
[4:03] just lift up your arms and say I believe
[4:06] God what come what may I believe God in
[4:09] Me For Me All Around Me
[4:13] [Applause]
