softly say oh sweet Jesus oh sweet Jesus take my life oh it's banelings although it's tried the only thing I've ever done that's right I surrender now completely your arms around me sweetie as I hear

your arms around me sweetly as I hear you softly say [Music] but I'm not something you actually I said some other time discussion amen and then so we just try to to see if we can move in roots and finish if finish is fun because never I thought that maybe you want hope that time to go in just browsin you know breaking someone did we say I did then so what to say is that this is an intro what what what our nation overall say was people afraid that the Lord can just you guide me it's not fair that is why I was asking that what what we are here for it for it for it for a pip was for admission it's also directed to me I wish I must do it that way that I'm saying ha he's actually meant to recap last time we spoke about the greatest battle ever fought and we spoke was that there that this battle started in heaven no problem I put a problem with you because what is that little girl silly things directing here to do this no wonder the Lord said if you cannot take the kingdom of God like this little ones yeah huh well she raised them did he praise God so he'll not be a street of the devil it must be the Holy Spirit directing here to do this right yeah so we said the battle started in heaven Lucifer's keep down here amen and it came to this earth and it landed in there no man showed normal slain as that greet when when you boys who play marbles Oh will will bet ten sentences ten cent for this group they used to be a state that says the winner takes all huh so in this battle the winner takes the winner takes all the winner doesn't take half if the Lord Jesus wins and take nd as his he doesn't take half of nd he takes all of India and then so the Lord won't take 1/2 of brother James half of snow he takes everything the way that you saw you from the beginning I'm trying to recap and I'm going the other way we said that an army and you see like this law is very innocent he's just innocent and if we can take the kingdom of God like this guy we'll have no problems we are guaranteed our seat at the marriage supper amen we said the army is us we are as an army and we have to be chained we spoke about the army that must be trained we spoke that the army must be equipped we said that the army must must be you know physically the army must be physically ready isn't it physically and mentally ready in the physical realm on earth that's how an army should be isn't it so now and we also said that the army should have the ammunition we said that the army should have the weapons no used to have loads and loads of ammunition but there's no way point to load it or have big guns machine guns in bazookas ak-47 but there's no ammunition so those are the things that a literal military army needs to fight the battle right and then we saw we said that in this battle God means to open up the channels remember that they discussion deliver that the the channel of H of a son and a daughter of God must be open in order for God to come and work through that channel and we said the battle this belt that is being fought in the mind and his sir is so to an extent that the devil the devil cannot actually does not even stick to the rules of war what they say the rules of war if you can find you look in that way and maybe can just finish you off and always he will do that that's the type of an enemy that we are fighting if he can find you and aware that you are doing an error just for him to be mean and get into hell he will do that so he's not going to wait for you like in boxing they say no no no no no he's down living they count no no no no there's no rules of who according to the devil even though our Lord Jesus he's a gentleman he tries to fight with him baby I don't think if devil was God you live in allow users to come and talk to him but our Savior our captain allows him to come and discuss about about how is the battleground going how is my children how is my son and the devil accused me even allows him to accuse us that's how dissent is but the enemies are complete opposites because he himself is the son of perdition the son of perdition the father of lies so surely we cannot expect anything good from him we know and might be alert as the army that no matter what we can the roots of all that we can stick to our enemy could be around the corner our enemy could read now be aiming at us and that means brothers and sisters that they we have to be forever ready all the time am i right uh-uh uh-uh you know I was so blessed last the three less than this powerful for me strong I was I was very blessed I was blessed because the word spoke to me about love but at the end was talking about it I thought this group was not high enough that shouldn't be able yes that's so strong for me that area lasted a we cannot make it without that love in fact it's not a question of making that place is full of love so we have to be that love to be there then came brother Isaac that we are God the proof is saved the Prophet says yeah unless of course now we have gods you know despite the fact that God naturally emit a human being to be a God of all the nature and they then everything to control despite the abilities that God has given us God as particularly the brightest made as a mature God if they're a child of God you are a God so that really blessed me so much and and and and my message runs it's gonna just run through those messages then plug the band just put cherry on top on Sunday me sometimes is difficult to come and preach when people like that come in bridge it's very difficult because now here just you are wobbling around but now I was signed to recap we have recap right and i've refreshed your mind I might have not said everything that we discussed seven eight minutes now AB recap eight minutes right now I'm going to proceed with my last remaining minutes and see where will the Lord lend us then I'll learn from you extra minutes you can charge me interest this one but now actually proceed here just bear with me if I repeat settled is because the list actually you can think the message repeats itself but because the message is one big one one big truth one big thing that is no you cannot talk of something without talking of something that is why a brother preaches and you connect something to the other message and a brother preaches this and you can because the message even the prophet you will think that is repeating himself no he is saying it as it is we emphasize things to try to laid it into your soul Amen now did this pattern that we are talking about is a battle between life and death is the battle between faith and doubt is there a battle between victory and was the opposite of victory now defeats the complete is a battle between the truth and the life is the battle between death and life now when you fight for your life when you are fighting for your life it's not a joke it's not something that you can do it on part-time basis it's not something that you can joke around and then just come to change something that you can say be a good social group people to fellowship with it's not something when you fight you for life when you know and you know goddess rebuild your eyes it's not something that you can just sit there in that wonderful bunch of people yeah you know they're so good let me just in around it's not something that you are cause this means you don't realize if you do that you are not realizing what is this battle about this that is about life and death it's about going to heaven or go into hell hell with the prophets say not even your worst enemies you wish that you must go there this is the battle that you are fighting now now we are going to talk about today just just a little bit to say okay fine we have seen how the battle is supposed to set we said we have understand what the battle is we understand who are the people that were over there two groups we spoke last time about the two spirit there's two forces only the first of God and the force of the devil there's no other force there's not many forces only two you are either this side or this side we are fighting we are saying in this battle you either kill or you are killed that's not the rule of this bedroom you add a swim or you you do drown you think right that is what we are fighting for this day and let me tell you something let me just make it happy just before if we proceed what if the wonderful thing about this bedroom that's an exciting element about this is that this battle you are already current deed of the outcome you already know the outcome huh I like that some not the brother from tinder scene he says it tiny t has 108 any ts1 you know the song you know tell me tell me tell me too he's talking about time and eternity he says tell me my friend who's going to win today huh attendance is no eternity as one because Jesus has come eternity has won that's what me and you know today the better outcome has already predetermined it's already known but the enemy because he hasn't got the element of the from the Lord Jesus Christ which you're going to talk about now the ones that you keep you and me to just to verify you know when they say you are verifying they mean you are just bringing a paper to try to verify to the bank that is you is you this account is yours the other thing is not you account they're saying just come over with your identity to verify your account the other things not your account so all we are doing here on earth we are just here for a process of verification to manifest who we are because he saw us before the foundation of them and he fought and he defeated Lucifer and he kicked him down to earth he's that goal let's go fight down on earth you'll find a part of me there and I'm going to show you again that I would be Fiji also they came to the cross also repeat that even he went to there and he went to even he took the keys huh so he's got no more keys now I can't control so he's powerless another Isaac studied very clear and and Brad at that time I thought if we go out there we just meet the devil and just show you that you are a bluff lastly you bless me so much because what you said is the truth nothing else I told you not that I said is that there's nothing to adjust what you say or to amend it or to spice it it's just simply the truth we are God and if you believe what you want to do you will do it it will come to pass because the others give another capability I'm deviating again to his message because it blessed me so very much why are you saying this about what the Isaac's message because one of the biggest elements that we need the Prophet says God has got an atomic bomb the mother of all Bernstein is there in the USA I saw it but that one our one that is the baby one the one for some it's the baby Bob the Lord just whatever atomic bomb a mighty one that when you blow the devil is an understatement to say that he just that demystified is an understatement of all weapons the Prophet says it is called FAI th ah it's called faith but faith is an atomic bomb for God and went ahead of myself anyway I said we said that okay we we now understand how the battle must be fought we need to understand now what do we need in this battle what I've just mentioned now first one is that atomic bomb we need that atomic bomb and it comes from the Lord doesn't come from us God gives it God gives you the faith to believe him that is why he says no one can come unto me except the father calls him I always said to my children he said the Lord ask anything and you shall be given right isn't it Rebecca that's what he said right and then he said no I said what do you want you see me that we are fighting is so screwed to a point that he can even blame your realization of what you need does anybody get me did you catch me he is not dangerous that he can bear your understanding your realization that oh no no no I actually meet this let me show you in this way what I'm trying to say is I'm sitting there I'm praying let's say I realize that I don't have joy now I see I don't have joy I can I'm not happy I'm touching me I'm just I'm not if I've got Chinese happiness now instead of me not proceeding being unhappy all I need to do is to real that God said I can ask him happiness huh he said ask me anything he didn't say ask me those things that you can do is that if it ask me anything sometimes you realize that you are lacking here but you you're not asking God but he's not ask me anything even that small thing that you think does not matter that's more small thing except that you don't have it you need it ask him believe it using the atomic amen now we we discussed and said there are three seconds in that one which is faith or doubt situated there then we said the inner one the middle one where we find memory imagination reasoning and outer one you find the other five senses we said that the first two outer layers they are not the right ones to use when you fight this enemy because him he went for training God also can come because that's where the Spirit is what can use them but God specializes in just one one faith now the devil tries you see we are believers we need can I put it this way can I say you must believe in your face you must believe in faith your faith you must believe in your faith that it will work in as much as you must be with you put a doubt you must doubt your doubts you must doubt it your doubt that the enemy will not overcome you but the Lord that the Lord can help you that faith that we have you must believe in that faith let me remind you of it and door within a door who knows that message whereas the kisses I see a will tell you within a wheel so know now you know our faith in simple terms what I'm trying to say is that believing in your page you need to be able to exercise your pain you last week we had that faith without works huh a car without at all it's just as beautiful good-for-nothing it is worse than my 1966 Mazda 3 to 3 that is full of petrol can take me from yes to the command review Toronto but in Mercedes na c63 what do you call top of the range no Kazumi with the lastly shaky I'm happy there's no one with the Mercedes integer so it can't take me to and repair oh it can't take me not even two apart from here but you said a wonderful one people passes there's a while but it can take anyway but is babies or twigs where don't save you you cannot use gasoline from here today you need a car but that come must be full of petrol now this phase that we need that's another element of this atomic bomb right now we believe we hear the way comes through our mind we process it then we we now goes down to our hearts I'm not correcting what I said last time what I'm trying to say is that in as much as we hear from the outside let me say to in actual fact they really hear you we hear from inside ah it comes we hear with this physical ear by the time we think that we are hearing and we believe God has done something already that is going to come from the inside outside the preferences it comes from the inside where faith come the time you say no no no what you are telling me as ah I'm not hearing you I've already refused what you are telling me you understand what I'm trying to say so faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God now and God is the one who gives us the faith to be and then we add on that to our mind it come the problem is this that our enemy tries to block it before it can go down there you see that's where the battle is because he specializes in the first and the second ring where it is reasoning when there is an imagination he just shows you things that I impossible he shows much do you ever believe that people will you people like this people will be taken and go high and change we didn't I take a look up and I come on the tractor is he hasn't gone down there he's trying to block it right he's trying to block the atomic bomb of God using his area of speciality by reasoning memory huh he can even do miracles in those areas huh he can do miracles the devil but because we are equipped by our Heavenly Father we are able to detect that is where Martin Luther is it Martin Luther San Martin when that angel in the dream came how many remember that huh he would see that he's already wearing a crown how come what kind of these of King is this one who's already crown but the Bible says the Saints are going to crown e-even King of Kings so we put those eyes that God has given us to see that this one is the devil we must be able in this battle to be able to detect to see this one it's not my sister doing this thing that's the devil amen amen and then then the prophecies yeah now the battle was messed up with Blas ray he's busy raging Eve is the one who allowed it our our mother Eve is the one who allowed the better by do you watch by listening to the devil not even accepting yet just to listen so let's just have a lesson of learning how not to listen to the reasons of the dinner how not to listen to the devil cooking is that I'm saying to you learn how to protect your own thoughts ah let me how to reject your own thoughts meaning that in your heart we are able to sit was that in the inner circle is not powerful so powerful that it can overcome the two other circles which can say hey that's reasoning that's not my sort out that is a good store good out if you don't have what God has given you you are not able to do that so we stand God so much that he has given us so and we can experience teach our children when I was a boy I struggled so much to know which one is in the better that's exactly where he wanted me yeah he wants you where you cannot realize him but the day you realized the devil he supposed right so he does not want you to know he'll ever come to you and and pretend as if he is God now and memory thoughts it was suicide amen those are from the devil now I wanna do something here for you then and hey okay I spoke about cliches I spoke about memory and all those things and I say and he uses them and then so that if you listen to him like it deed and then that's why he sleep under defeat by the time you realize that you are you were already on his side you're already fighting against your brothers and sisters you're fighting against yourself amen so now let's let's pick you go to the ammunition we spoke about faith and you say that and in order for this battle to be able to be when you're in the battlefront you need em the Prophet says they make Sarah says no we don't need that's not used a 22 rifle let's let's use the atomic bomb what squad say what atomic bomb now faith in what in myself faith in what I can do today I can do it I can drive I can I can I can run I can write I can no no faith in God's Way you see that's what he says he says we need to hey who's got atomic bomb which is faith in God's Way and a to have faith in God's Word it does not just come like when they give you the pizza at that show Domino's know it comes by Yalie how do you hear the word of God you just take a book anybody can read anyone can take the Bible read but you need to read with the eyes of faith when you read your Bible when you read the spoken with you are listening in with the eyes and the ears of faith you are listening with that you know hey okay this children I can give that example but you know it happened in awhile you know I have been except the wipe except the husband's right we are accepting you know we accepting you listen with the es of attitude of saying I want to listen our and tracks X not okay wait before I even finish when someone has said before I even finish you already said no in your mind no no that's not the ears that I'm talking the ears and the mind of God and the eyes we have is the eyes of thing come Lord I'm all yours Sodom those look that's when your faith grows that's when you are to me one becomes more stronger that's when you are able to realize the enemy when he come when you can see that this is the devil this is then you can fight better but another ammunition laughs now brother spoke about it this one is just Emmaline itself the aspect of love because somewhere in the Bible this is that any dirty of that charity you can have all the things but you've got no charity the charity that I'm talking about in as much as our our worldly charity is wonderful I love our charity on earth so God given one but I'm talking about the charity for God who can tell me which one is that one which love is that one a Coppola that's the charity for God to love the unlovable because what is the use of life you only those who loves you because even the sinners can love those that love them huh our God the devil only loves do I wonder even if he laughs I wonder I doubt I doubt this doubt I doubt that he loves those that better on your side because he's taking them to help you we need to be able to love the unlovable to lab where they does not see much to be a lab you know that is a powerful ammunition but it until the Bible says God is love right ah Coppola now that love is so strong that me who was in sin and iniquity unsavable he loved me you Mizzou that love for one another you must use that love not only for brothers and sisters en Church who must use that love even for our neighbors use that love for people when I was 3 I found myself praying for the people on my street that God give me a brother nd now I think this thing's moving give me something to eat can lower and can know you through me that's the kind of love that that we need to have for God so loved the world he's not talking about the cosmos the planet when he says he loved the world it means that he loved the people on to save them now we are his wife we are part of him we need to be like that we the Word of God will bring us to full maturity to build a bit without us making any effort think about it let us quickly just backtrack to Abraham in closing I was thinking to myself imagine if Abraham did not use that term iqbal of faith just just for a foot of thought what could have happen do you think he would have got Isaac what what where would where would everything be now who whose children were we going to be cold because we are our hands telling us by faith now today me and you sitting Abraham never believed if Abraham never he Abraham was not that soldier that stutes and use that coming bomb to blow off the devil to believe against hope to believe against unbelievable things unbelievable we say in science who says unbelievable that the man of so many years can never tell head off that's how we speak so if that's what a lot to me boy plus it blows the devil to a point that he could say this is me and I know this guy how I was pushing him around in the world for him but he does not realize that I've just bitten him with an atomic bomb that's how we fight this bedroom back to life who talked about only these two ammunitions there's plenty of ammunitions plenty of them from suffering patients you read the book of Pizza he talks about them you read about you read in the book of Timothy there's a lot and loss and loss of ammunition but it's true that I'm talking about these are the most important and basic ones not more important than others but is that a very fundamental and important ones that me and you must make sure that to win these battles we need to have them and if you don't have them no crisis and then you give it to you in closing we've got a general at the beginning we said and we said the Lord Jesus what did I say the beginning I forgot but the point is this that I want to tell you that way I said to you that you already have a current it's outcome of the war why because he is not fighting the war in absentia I'm not on borrowed time we agree the beginners remember now there isn't why we already have an outcome is because he you sell his thought and passion of this war he is with you remember you he said he said to Joshua I will be with you don't look to the left or to the right remember and the number one Georgia was there just about to take over he appeared with the sword and he said unknown on the captain is alone then he he worshiped you remember his right through the Bible is there even today he is yeah he's not a captain that fights in absence all with me and you need to do is to realize who we are to realize the battle that we are fighting to realize the ammunition that we have to realize the machine guns that we have to take them and put them in full use my advice not one business we've got a weak point as believers and I said I'm thinking to myself with what a weak point as believers we think but we can fight this battle on a pattern basis when the enemy is fighting and 24 hours he's busy he's planning crippling reviewing changing the ammunition we want to do it business want to read our Bible part-time want to pray part-time want to want to you know take time that's two seats I was saying to my daughter oh and meditate about God just think about you you say that doesn't he save in the book of some faith and you meditate about him just one the more you meditate about him he comes closer it was you engaging with the captain you are engaged you in the captain you are talking to your husband about things you tell you your husband I was just thinking about you have you ever seen look after James sister Nadine and he says one he says no I'm just looking at you and I was just thinking about you that is how the Lord Jesus is doing to us is that he wants us to take time in our busy schedule you children today to think about God to meditate about the Bible says day and but I'm missing some time in your day allocate time not day and night do it I would like you to do it but because we want we are busy and the Prophet gave us the mission he said plant our potatoes meat was we're busy planting potatoes right so that in the Lottery's tomorrow we can eat but take time in your busy schedule to eat to pray to meditate about you to call upon the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives you are going to tell give a testimony and tell the brothers and sisters what has happened young girls do that for me you know that something that you love the most Susanna if they say tomorrow Anna Lee you are going to what first hope you will please my dear what's your favor is please your favorite planes like to move your destination sorry to put you on the spot let's say they say you're going to that be very pleased tomorrow 4 o clock a.m. Hannah Lee must be at Willington effort tell you brother as they Bowl see what happens to you are ready yes indeed you are telling you because it means so much to you don't you ask yourself why the prophet priest a message concerned and then convinced because this means so much to you it means so much if only God can give us the realization of what he means to us of what he is to us of what what what actually has transpired for us to find ourselves to be where we are today we will realize that we will do three four ten times what we are doing and what is nice that we are not doing ourselves he's doing it for us he's doing it through us all he does just anoint you with his presence oops that the ball goes there you run that is why if you do things for God you sit down later already become your physical just ah you realize that only then you realize that you are tired but the Holy Spirit when is in you you don't even realize that you are hungry you don't realize it I don't know to break but I didn't eat today I was just three and I said god help me help me but now I'm speaking like I'll just finish my dinner I don't want the food because you want to be in the presence of God and if soon or later the presence of God takes over and you're just in Jubilee records in the Train then just let it see you laughing she can almost you okay boy he does not know what are you laughing about because you're not living a cell phone at least you're gonna say you iridium what's up no yeah meanwhile you do I had the same thank you Lord Jesus if you have your your you are in Jubilee amen so now my long finish short story is that in every battle there must be progress yep this is the closing now closing remarks in every battle there must be a progress you don't want a child who's eating every day you know that little boy of mine name his name is Liam imagine eating me they eat they yeah in yeah I'm sorry to you as an example my boy but he's growing and we we see the SL going by there's no progress on this chart you will see there's a problem with a child you take him to the highest specialist in New Zealand to check the Parisian what's wrong with this child is everything is fine with you in spirit nicely but is not growing when we are in a better we need to be able to see that a at an immediate that one is eliminated out let's next then you can see I am not where I'm supposed to be but I'm not where I used to be that's when you are able to be able to say me a testimony that God have done this and this and gifts for me I may not be where I'm supposed to be but I'm not where I used to be why am I not where I used to be because that one out I don't like what's up anymore more than the way I don't like Facebook I don't like I don't like this and this and this that you know you used to do I don't like this anymore none of that I used to hate that brother but you know child you don't have such problems I'm just to do general that thing that I used to like but be oh I thought I'll never split with these separate but it's gone have you never one on something and you see how did it happen and you are surprised that's what I'm talking about progress in this bedroom you need to be able to see the progress that I am it and that progress cannot just come it come when you apply all this ammunition and you should you shoot and you eat your way you eat your way you meditator you need to do eat in English they say you must be consistent if in a car if he's driving if the petrol flow is not consistent it will cut we say Jenny Mike hours Jake uses the Christian borrowed me the silver because there was a problem maybe with an injection or the petrol car it was not the problem he's faced now it goes no cutting now because it's consistent we need to be consistent we need to fight for consistent but all that has a priest one time about fight I like you so much he's a fight and a fight you must you must keep up with the fight you must have that resilience and if you don't have that resilience what do you do you ask no problem you need something you don't have it you ask me realize that you want this and for you to get this you need distance anyone for this then one give you so that you can get this all you do you ask and you shall be given you don't have the right shoe you can walk with the left soooo you ask then God gives in you're good to see you realize that you can talk properly or you realize anything I am trying to simplify anything but you realize that you need something in order for you to get something you don't ask for this even just a set one to get this before yet you ask for that one that's what you need to do ask anything as even the Lord to reveal to you what you don't know that you must ask I always just know ask me what you will know that you must ask if you read in the book of Romans chapter eight from a subject he says the holy spirit intercede for us he even talk about us the things that we need that you don't know us so many things we don't know that we need or we can we must have and we don't ask for them and the enemy will try his level best so that you know that if you ask you'll believe it in your head so you cover it as much as possible so we are the Watchers pose them just like our errors our mistakes he can expose them not just pose you let's pose them so that you can confess them before you because if you confess when you call the name of the Lord he answers you you see that is as simple as that this one even my little Libya can do Delhi is easy this Michael let us jump enough may God bless solution they need to be a growth they need to be tangible progress not an imaginary one they need to be a progress which we say you know one day the Prophet the Lord helped him and he was just new in his ministry and he went to this house fixing the gas pipes and everything him and this lady who was sick swear to me code names about this matter if someone can show you with your mother it's a terrible thing no the Prophet said that day I knew that the Holy Ghost and that I have is real because that's the progress I'm talking about that you need to be able to look back and say ha I'm used to be here I'm here by the grace of God yeah I take it that means yet you're going some way you are eliminating the little attendants you are eliminating the we are fighting a good fight amen that is way out left to stop I just wanna I just want to talk to the Lord I just continued at the beginning because I thought with a brief description last time but the script the bay scripture for this someone that will be busy with tonight is the book of Ephesians you know about it I read it last time for you so I didn't read it today I thought we can just hit the ground running but the official chapter 5 and then chapter 6 sorry for this chain remember I read it past 17 I went to space 18 19 them and then also the book of Peter first Peter chapter 5 so those are our base clip just which we can go and enjoy and redo Scripture may God bless his weight may God bless my little waist to you hoping that you were hearing me very well let's just a pretty walk around a bend to come and finish up with the prayer requests I just wanna talk to the Lord in Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you know that I cannot talk Lord Jesus - to your people because it's not an easy thing but Jesus and I pray that way I did not say things like that you can put them right in your own way father and you said you your own church Lord you don't need to move for anyone we are the ones who need you father and father I thank you so much that you lay deep in my heart to speak about this new title she's not little but father is so great the only way that I could do it father I mean you bless your people bless their hearts Lord and bless each and every family in this church Lord bless every mother bless me Father bless every sister brother young man young man bless our children father God as we are engaging in this battle the more we talk about these things the more we exposed how the enemy finds as the moor is going to fight more father we pray that you can also strengthen us that we can also further God build a strong battle in us doesn't matter our size doesn't matter our capabilities what matters for the goal is the pedal that you can put in us to fight and to win Oh God it was you are a winner father God we are already the winners and father we bless your name as we go home now give everything back into thy hands for your honor for your glory as we pray this evening with much with much of Thanksgiving in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
