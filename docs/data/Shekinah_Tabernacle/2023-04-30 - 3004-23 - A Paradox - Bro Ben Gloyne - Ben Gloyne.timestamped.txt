[7:36] welcome to the house of law this morning
[7:39] [Music]
[7:40] it's very nice to be here it's good to
[7:42] see your faces to see redeemed
[7:46] Eternal sons of God and Daughters of God
[7:51] we had a little game of basketball and
[7:55] Futsal with the adults and the youth the
[7:58] other day and I had to
[8:00] um
[8:02] we had the the adults team had these um
[8:06] purple
[8:07] basketball tops which I think fish must
[8:10] have got from somewhere and we were the
[8:12] 11 8ors
[8:14] emphasis on the word lemon
[8:17] but um we had to share these tops
[8:21] because we didn't have enough of them so
[8:23] one brother would come off sweetie and
[8:26] there and then he would take his his
[8:28] singlet off and give it to me he like I
[8:31] had I got
[8:33] um rather Marion's won one session you
[8:36] know what Mario's like he runs fast and
[8:38] doing all the stuff and he's sweating
[8:40] but we agreed that it was eternal DNA on
[8:43] there so we didn't mind I said I'll take
[8:47] it
[8:48] I'm gonna look forever now I've got
[8:50] Eternal DNA on me so because he's a
[8:53] brother in Christ
[8:55] amen it's good it's good times to be
[8:57] living in now we live in such exciting
[8:59] times for the bride of Christ the lord
[9:02] is
[9:04] ministering and moving in our midst and
[9:07] is going to do more and more in such a
[9:08] powerful way
[9:09] and the conditions in the world are
[9:12] becoming such that that's just the way
[9:14] it has to be the the presence of God is
[9:16] going to raise up the standard like he
[9:19] said that he would against the the
[9:20] onslaught
[9:22] you know we see morally the situation in
[9:25] the world is decaying there's a there's
[9:26] a moral decay
[9:28] if you look at statistics from what they
[9:30] was even in this country
[9:32] 120 years ago to what there is now it's
[9:35] it's a phenomenal difference
[9:37] divorces there were maybe a couple of
[9:39] cases yeah not many per year murders
[9:42] there were one per year things like that
[9:44] it was it's just amazing that the the
[9:46] place where we've come
[9:49] and even
[9:52] um you know there's an onslaught of
[9:54] Darkness even the the economy you know
[9:55] we think we've had a bad run with covert
[9:57] and things this
[9:58] there's like a currency crisis at the
[10:01] door for the world which most most
[10:02] people don't realize it's there that the
[10:05] whole currency system's about to
[10:08] finish it's done these have never lasted
[10:10] for
[10:11] much time they have all come to an end
[10:13] these currencies that we use and this
[10:15] this one is about to come to an end it's
[10:17] happening as we speak it's
[10:20] Banks all around the world are buying up
[10:22] gold and things are happening it's it's
[10:24] phenomenal the place we were at and the
[10:27] the signs that the prophets were told
[10:29] the things that that
[10:31] we knew would happen are happening it's
[10:32] so exciting a lot of people are scared
[10:35] but we're not scared we're excited
[10:38] because
[10:39] the Bible said when you see these things
[10:41] happen you look up your Redemption
[10:42] drawers nice amen and and
[10:45] you know we we're going to have such a
[10:47] good time in the Lord
[10:49] day by day as time goes on you know the
[10:52] the power of God and the presence of the
[10:54] Lord is going to be more and more
[10:55] manifest in our lives
[10:56] day by day you're on the winning team
[10:58] and it's good to be on the winning team
[11:00] and we don't have to fear a thing so
[11:02] let's stand this morning and and just
[11:04] give the Lord thanks and praise that
[11:06] that we can come and I think you'll find
[11:09] as the weeks and months roll on go go

[11:13] the most valuable thing in your life
[11:15] will be the the Lord his word and the
[11:17] brethren I think you're fine because
[11:19] you'll realize that those are those
[11:21] things are eternal
[11:22] amen and that's what we want this
[11:24] morning is to to set our mind on things
[11:26] Eternal this morning no we don't come
[11:27] here to to do natural things to increase
[11:29] naturally we come here to increase
[11:30] spiritually and to to set our eyes on

[44:15] going to read down to verse 16 here
[44:17] it says uh then 3000 men of Judah went
[44:21] to the Top of the Rock uh item instead
[44:24] of Samson know us they are not uh that
[44:26] the Philistines uh rulers over us what
[44:29] is this that thou has done unto us and
[44:32] he said unto them as they did unto me so
[44:34] I've done unto them and they said unto
[44:37] him we uh come down to bind thee that we
[44:39] may deliver thee into the hand of the
[44:41] Philistines and Samson said unto them
[44:43] swear unto me that you will not fall
[44:46] upon me yourselves and they spake unto
[44:48] him saying no we will bind thee fast and
[44:51] deliver the into their hand but surely
[44:52] we'll not kill thee and they bound him
[44:54] with two new chords and bought him up
[44:56] from the Rock and when he came unto
[44:59] Lehigh the Philistines shouted against
[45:01] him and the spirit of Lord came up
[45:03] mightily upon him and the chords that
[45:04] will upon his arms became as Flex that
[45:07] was burnt with fire and his bands loose
[45:10] from Office hands and he found a new
[45:12] Jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand
[45:14] and took it and slew a thousand men
[45:16] there with and Samson said with the
[45:19] Jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with
[45:21] the Jawbone of an ass have I slammed a
[45:23] thousand men
[45:25] amen
[45:27] it's about his Amen in prayer this
[45:29] morning
[45:30] amen gracious father we want to thank
[45:32] you so much we can come to honor the
[45:34] resurrection this morning Lord knowing
[45:36] that Lord the tomb is empty dear God
[45:38] because you Rose law that death could
[45:40] not hold you the grave could not keep
[45:42] you Lord and it cannot keep us Lord
[45:44] because you said because I love you
[45:45] shall have also amen so we want to thank
[45:47] you Lord that we can look upon each
[45:49] other and say what a resurrection this
[45:50] is Lord because of what you've done in
[45:52] our lives and dear God as we come this
[45:55] morning we've read your word we need you
[45:56] the great author once again to come and
[45:58] make it live oh God so Lord may you
[46:00] anoint both speaker and hearer Lord may
[46:02] you come live among us Lord touch our
[46:04] hearts speak to our lives like only you
[46:06] can amen indeed God we want to remember
[46:08] Brother Andy Lord as he's ministering up
[46:10] and Fielding this morning Lord I pray
[46:11] you'd fill his mouth with your words
[46:13] Lord and speak to everyone eat up their
[46:15] lord according to your riches and Glory
[46:16] May bless the Clifford family and give
[46:18] them Journey Mercies home Lord and
[46:19] father in on here Lord who who couldn't
[46:22] make it here because of sickness or Lord
[46:24] of need in their life Lord River they
[46:25] may be Lord May touch them and be their
[46:27] portion we love you Lord we want to
[46:29] thank you we can commit Our Lives into
[46:30] your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[46:32] amen amen God bless you may have your
[46:35] seats this morning so I'd like to take a
[46:38] thought here about a paradox where where
[46:40] brother Brown would say um uh mentioning
[46:42] this the scripture where Samson would
[46:44] kill a thousand men with a job owner of
[46:47] an ass here
[46:48] um he said now so this little fellow
[46:50] standing out here all at once here Came
[46:52] Upon these Philistines and and
[46:54] surrounded him to kill him and he took
[46:56] the Jawbone of a mule that was laying
[46:57] there a wild one little donkeys picked
[46:59] up the Jawbone of that mule and the
[47:01] spirit Lord came upon him and there was
[47:03] a paradox how did he beat down with a
[47:05] Jawbone of a mule though that half um
[47:08] half thick half inch thick helmet over
[47:11] the top of the head with a Jawbone of a
[47:13] mule why the first that old jaw bone uh
[47:16] laying there the first liquor would have
[47:18] hit it would have burst it to a thousand
[47:19] pieces over the top of those helmets all
[47:21] those big shields win a thousand rushed
[47:24] in upon him and he beat every one of
[47:26] them to death a paradox that's when the
[47:28] spirit of God Came Upon him and then the
[47:30] prophet says oh if we could only bleed
[47:32] your bones in the hands of God there
[47:34] would be another Paradox yeah amen so
[47:37] he's saying if we're just like that that
[47:39] Jawbone there in the hands of hands of
[47:41] Samson if we're like that in the hands
[47:43] of God God you know there'll be another
[47:45] Paradox upon the Earth and we know a
[47:47] paradox you know it's something that's
[47:49] unreasonable but it's really incredible
[47:51] Webster it says it's true it's something
[47:54] incredible it's you can't understand it
[47:56] it's just a mystery but it's incredible
[47:58] it's unreasonable but it's true that's
[48:00] what a paradox is and God has is calling
[48:04] a people for another Paradox and really
[48:06] our life already are a paradox they are
[48:09] unreasonable to the world Amen when we
[48:11] look at you know you know it's a paradox
[48:13] when we look through the scripture to
[48:15] see you know the kind of people that God
[48:17] calls it's actually unreasonable you
[48:19] know when he doesn't call the learner he
[48:21] doesn't call the educated he doesn't
[48:23] call the religious and the pious and the
[48:24] you know the high and mighty of society
[48:27] but he but he calls the outcasts he
[48:29] calls the people who would never be
[48:31] considered for anything you know we're
[48:32] not the strongest we're not the fastest
[48:34] we're not the smartest we don't have a
[48:36] Nobel Prize Among Us
[48:38] I mean you know we don't have great a
[48:40] lot of degrees and phds and so on and
[48:42] nothing wrong with those things but we
[48:43] don't have those things among us really
[48:45] you know we are we are the just the
[48:48] unknowns of society but God uses those
[48:51] kind of people to perform a paradox when
[48:53] you think about this very scientific age
[48:55] we live in we are where man knows where
[48:57] he thinks he knows pretty much
[48:58] everything top of a you know you know
[49:00] Google will tell you how quickly it is
[49:02] you know that'll that'll give you a
[49:04] search answer back and you know
[49:05] everything's at our fingertips like
[49:07] never before and man thinks he's got
[49:08] everything worked out but your God is
[49:10] going to work a paradox in this age he's
[49:12] going to take a people and work a
[49:14] paradox where it's something that to man
[49:15] it's unreasonable you know it's
[49:17] something that is that is just not you
[49:19] know shouldn't be so but it is true amen
[49:22] you know the great Paradox we know as a
[49:24] people walking with the Lord and and
[49:26] then and then and then they take he he
[49:29] takes them like he did Enoch and we are
[49:31] not because God takes us home amen so
[49:34] you know the Lord would say in Isaiah 55
[49:36] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[49:37] neither my ways or your ways saith the
[49:39] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[49:41] the earth so my ways are higher than
[49:43] your ways and my thoughts than your
[49:44] thoughts amen so his thoughts his
[49:47] thoughts are different to man's thoughts
[49:48] you know that's why man is going in the
[49:50] completely opposite direction to to
[49:52] God's way it's because our ways our
[49:55] thoughts naturally are not his thoughts
[49:57] but when the spirit of God comes into a
[49:59] person's life and then then therefore
[50:01] they receive the mind of Christ they
[50:03] walk with God that's a paradox amen I
[50:05] mean that's a paradox when it's not even
[50:07] within man to seek after God it's
[50:09] actually not even in our own makeup to
[50:11] seek after him it's actually a work of
[50:13] Grace you know you know the grace of our
[50:15] Lord actually that puts a hunger the
[50:16] Deep calling to the Deep Amen to that in
[50:19] itself is a paradox where maybe all of
[50:22] your family all of your friends all of
[50:24] your colleagues they are not interested
[50:25] in God at all maybe religion but not God
[50:27] but yet there's something in you says I
[50:29] want him that's a paradox I mean it's
[50:31] unreasonable to the world to think that
[50:33] actually Jesus Christ is alive amen his
[50:36] word is true he's fulfilling it in this
[50:37] day you go on the street start telling
[50:39] people about the prophecy that's being
[50:41] fulfilled in this day they'd say that's
[50:42] unreasonable you know they would explain
[50:44] it away they say you're crazy man you're
[50:46] full of conspiracy theories and fake
[50:48] news but no the Bible is not fake news
[50:50] the Bible is not conspiracy theory I
[50:52] mean but the Bible is we are living in
[50:54] Bible days once again we're seeing so
[50:56] many scriptures being fulfilled in the
[50:58] day we live I'm so thankful for that
[50:59] amen we're not wandering along blindly
[51:02] amen see man thinks that the way up is
[51:04] up right so so those who are smart those
[51:08] who are proud and you know you know
[51:10] those who have a Persona of being
[51:11] Invincible they think that's the way
[51:12] that is up but really with God the Way
[51:15] Up Is Down amen because whosoever exalts
[51:18] himself shall be a beast and he that
[51:19] humbleth himself shall be exalted so so
[51:22] that's a paradox in itself man says
[51:24] that's unreasonable amen that actually
[51:26] the Way Up Is Down but with God the Way
[51:28] Up Is Down amen so the more humble you
[51:31] get the more he can lift you up amen the
[51:33] more humble you get the more he can show
[51:35] you in his word the more humble you can
[51:36] get the more God can live in your life I
[51:38] remember but when we think we're
[51:39] something and then we think we can
[51:41] fulfill it and we think we can do it
[51:42] then well we're just going down
[51:45] we're not going up amen so it's really
[51:48] the opposite Amen brother Brown would
[51:49] say give me a preacher give me a
[51:51] Christian give me a housewife that's a
[51:53] Christian give me a farmer or a factory
[51:55] worker that will put God first in
[51:57] everything I'll show you a man who will
[51:59] be successful in spite of all the devil
[52:01] can put on him he seeks God first see
[52:04] that's a paradox I mean because we know
[52:06] we're not exempt from trials amen just
[52:08] because we're Believers actually we get
[52:09] more trials I mean when you give your
[52:11] life to the Lord you're actually signing
[52:13] up for the battle amen because why
[52:15] because now you've got an opposing Force
[52:17] you've actually actually declared a
[52:18] revolution against the devil saying
[52:20] devil I'm not going to be under your
[52:22] tyranny anymore you're turning anymore
[52:23] I'm going to Dethrone you amen I'm gonna
[52:26] I'm gonna I'm actually gonna become a
[52:28] Republic from hell yeah amen I'm not I'm
[52:30] not under its Dominion anymore I'm not
[52:32] part of it's Commonwealth I'm a free man
[52:34] or a free woman amen that's when that's
[52:36] when the battle begins amen but you know
[52:38] it's a paradox for someone to actually
[52:40] start walking with God and keep walking
[52:42] with God Amen that itself is something
[52:44] that's unreal reasonable it's incredible
[52:46] but yet it's true and it's more than
[52:48] possible
[52:49] Hallelujah I'm in a paradox seems so
[52:52] unreal to the world I meant something
[52:54] that they can't prescribe to something
[52:56] beyond their knowledge and understanding
[52:58] but when a simple heart will take that
[53:00] word and sink it into the depths of its
[53:02] being then the word produces the the
[53:04] live facts of that promise see a paradox
[53:07] is when you can believe the word and
[53:08] faith and it manifests it's incredible
[53:10] but yet it's true amen when you look at
[53:12] the promise of receiving the Holy Ghost
[53:14] God changes your nature burns out all
[53:16] the desires of sin and lust and
[53:18] everything that's a paradox where God
[53:20] himself changes the human nature of a
[53:23] person amen maybe there are genetics
[53:25] that they were born with you know it was
[53:26] all contrarian couldn't ask for
[53:28] forgiveness was you know stubborn and
[53:30] all these different things totally
[53:32] irreverent to religion but when the new
[53:33] birth comes to that kind of person
[53:35] they're quick to forgive they're loving
[53:37] amen you know you know they're not
[53:39] irreverent but they love the law with
[53:40] all their hearts what is that that's a
[53:41] paradox I mean for for God to change the
[53:44] nature of a person amen you're a living
[53:46] Paradox this morning I don't know if you
[53:48] realize it but you're a living Paradise
[53:49] so when I say God will have another
[53:51] Paradox I'm actually saying it's here
[53:53] right now amen we're not looking for
[53:54] something in the future but we're living
[53:56] paradoxes I mean and when you become a
[53:58] paradox you'll see a paradox more and
[54:00] more amen it's like in order to see a
[54:03] miracle you've got to become the miracle
[54:05] remember the greatest Miracle you'll
[54:07] ever see amen is not missing limbs come
[54:09] back I mean not even the resurrection of
[54:10] the dead but a converted soul from from
[54:13] unbelief to Faith I mean those are once
[54:15] walk in darkness are now walking with
[54:17] the Lord filled with the spirit and his
[54:19] goodness that is the greatest Miracle
[54:21] because that is an eternal Miracle
[54:22] remember Lazarus was raised but he had
[54:24] to die again isn't that right amen so
[54:27] that was incredible that would have been
[54:28] amazing to see I would have loved to
[54:29] seen that but yet Lazarus still had to
[54:32] go by the way of the Grave amen but on
[54:34] the day of Pentecost amen when the
[54:36] spirit of God came down into the into
[54:38] the disciples that was the greater
[54:39] Miracle because they passed from Death
[54:41] to life sure their natural bodies died
[54:43] but they didn't die amen they just
[54:45] changed remember death is just a travel
[54:47] bus to get us to where we want to go
[54:49] I mean to live is Christ but to die is
[54:51] gay in the Apostle Paul said amen so we
[54:54] shouldn't fear death we shouldn't fear
[54:55] the unknown because we know where we're
[54:56] going amen it's a paradox I mean for a
[54:59] people to walk upon the earth I mean but
[55:01] to know that there's a heaven to know
[55:03] there's a real there's a real heaven
[55:05] with a real Jesus that we're going to
[55:06] live in and it's more real than this
[55:08] world that's a paradox because with our
[55:10] five senses we can't look into the
[55:12] Unseen even even NASA and all of its
[55:15] telescopes and things it can't look into
[55:16] the Unseen World all the technology of
[55:18] this world could not look into the
[55:20] Unseen realm but that unseen realm was
[55:22] far more real than this one yeah so it's
[55:24] a paradox for a people to look actually
[55:26] to the Unseen by faith and see actually
[55:28] I have a theophany body I have an
[55:31] eternal body in the heavens waiting for
[55:32] me I have a real heaven I'm going to
[55:34] I've got a seat at the wedding supper
[55:36] table that's a paradox when God anchors
[55:38] that in your heart Hallelujah you become
[55:40] a living paradox
[55:42] Amen brother bran would say in the
[55:43] breach message amen he said John must
[55:45] have got real happy because John looked
[55:47] beyond the curtain of time when those
[55:49] seals were broke he says John must have
[55:51] looked in and seen past the curtain of
[55:52] time and said oh there's John Hallelujah
[55:55] well I said John store himself beyond
[55:57] the curtain of time already amen he must
[55:59] have got real happy and that's what
[56:00] happens when the word comes open God's
[56:02] actually telling you you're already
[56:04] there amen you may be in this Earthly
[56:06] Journey but you're already there
[56:08] hallelujah amen why because we're sealed
[56:11] to the day of our Redemption Hallelujah
[56:13] that's a paradox if you're unhappy I
[56:15] trust you get Happy by the end of the
[56:17] service hey man if you're going through
[56:18] a lot of trials in life I trust that
[56:20] they'll won't mean so much to you
[56:21] anymore after the service I remember
[56:23] you'll go out of this place rejoicing
[56:25] saying Thank You Lord amen you've
[56:27] brought me this far you're not going to
[56:28] leave me Hallelujah
[56:31] amen see it is unreasonable to think
[56:34] that it's actually faith is all that God
[56:36] looks at and that's what pleases him
[56:38] it's unreasonable to the human mind yeah
[56:40] why because the devil's made all kinds
[56:42] of religions with all kinds of works you
[56:45] know they you know the poor Catholic
[56:46] people think if they do their penances
[56:48] and they say they say they're Hail Marys
[56:51] they go on pilgrimages and they go rub
[56:52] these bones of Satan whoever and do all
[56:54] these different things they get less
[56:55] time in purgatory I feel sorry for them
[56:57] they're sincere they're devout they
[56:58] wanna they don't want to be in purgatory
[57:00] any longer no Purgatory is made up we
[57:02] know but they believe it right but they
[57:04] don't realize that it's actually Faith
[57:06] it's actually what you need a revelation
[57:08] yeah amen and because the Bible says in
[57:11] Hebrews 11 and 6
[57:14] but without faith it's impossible to
[57:16] please him
[57:17] she just take the opposite
[57:19] but with faith it's impossible not to
[57:21] please them
[57:23] right Hallelujah you become a living
[57:24] Paradox where it's not your works that
[57:26] please God remember this is not like a
[57:28] coffee card program
[57:30] well you know you buy none and get a
[57:32] free coffee you know well Lord I've
[57:33] prayed long enough I've listened much
[57:35] and I've done all this therefore Lord
[57:36] I'm entitled to a miracle this is not
[57:38] how this works no faith is what pleases
[57:40] God because Faith looks beyond
[57:42] circumstances remember faith is not
[57:44] based on how much money you have or not
[57:46] or the or how well your body is or how
[57:48] your family is doing or whatever more
[57:49] faith is not based on those things faith
[57:51] is independent of all those things and
[57:53] if we could realize that faith is
[57:55] independent of those things that our joy
[57:56] of the Lord doesn't come from what our
[57:58] our natural senses declare I mean
[58:01] because my natural senses may God my
[58:02] bank account say well there's a lot of
[58:04] zeros there
[58:05] right but that doesn't get me down right
[58:08] or fight you know you know so so My Five
[58:10] Senses shouldn't dictate to me my joy in
[58:13] the Lord my faith should dictate to me
[58:15] my joy in the Lord but you see this this
[58:17] age is a very self-absorbed age it's the
[58:20] age of selfies in me and me me me me and
[58:22] I I iPhone I life iCloud all these eyes
[58:25] see nothing against Apple but hey you
[58:27] know Samsung's just Android you know
[58:29] whatever but you know but it's all about
[58:32] me and you know it's an obsessed
[58:34] generation and and the more obsessed
[58:36] people become the less happier they
[58:38] become because they see their faults
[58:40] their failures sure we all have them
[58:42] hey man praise the Lord we're still
[58:44] going to be in these bodies these bodies
[58:46] need changing praise God I think the
[58:48] older we get the more happier we are
[58:49] these boys have been changed not because
[58:51] we age but because we see our failures
[58:52] you don't begin to realize man this guy
[58:55] Lord you must really love me
[58:57] praise the Lord hallelujah but you see
[58:59] now this is why amen when we can look
[59:02] Beyond and see that our joy and God
[59:04] isn't based on how well or sick or rich
[59:07] or poor whatever it's not based on those
[59:09] things but it's actually based on the
[59:11] Lord saved us he's he saved me to keep
[59:14] me he's redeeming by his blood amen I'm
[59:16] one of his I mean then we can rejoice in
[59:19] any trouble and that's a paradox I think
[59:21] yeah you know you think about Jonah
[59:24] Jonah was a paradox in the valley of oil
[59:26] he was there you know you see the kids
[59:28] cartoons and plays and things of Jonah
[59:30] and the well and you know he's got like
[59:32] this much belly to walk in he's walking
[59:34] around that Wells belly
[59:36] I don't think it was like that at all
[59:39] he would have been because you know he
[59:41] would have been played squished up like
[59:42] this for three days and nights you know
[59:45] he didn't have a lot of legroom and
[59:46] stuff he would have been squished in
[59:47] like this fishing seaweed and everything
[59:49] total Blackness had no idea where he was
[59:52] but yet but yet he became a living
[59:55] Paradox because by faith he ignored the
[59:59] whale's belly and it was pushing him
[1:00:00] like this and the squeezing him and you
[1:00:02] know doing all kinds of stuff would have
[1:00:04] been real yuck you know the seaweed
[1:00:06] round his neck and all these things
[1:00:07] brother man talks about but he became a
[1:00:09] paradox because he looked beyond the
[1:00:11] whale's belly he looked beyond himself
[1:00:13] he said Lord I'm going to pray once more
[1:00:15] to your Holy Temple and he didn't have a
[1:00:18] GPS you know there's uh apps I don't
[1:00:19] have my phone here but you know there's
[1:00:21] apps you can get that show that where
[1:00:23] the stars are and everything in the
[1:00:24] heavens
[1:00:25] so and and then even you know you know I
[1:00:27] imagine the Muslims would have one for
[1:00:28] where the cabalers and Mecca and I can
[1:00:31] find exactly where it is and so you know
[1:00:33] if it was Jonah was today he would have
[1:00:35] had an app on his phone they said now
[1:00:37] where is the temple
[1:00:38] and he couldn't no but he didn't do that
[1:00:40] it was by faith he looked well so he
[1:00:43] became a paradox many many Israelites no
[1:00:46] doubt would have said well the well
[1:00:47] Jerusalem's this way so I'll pray this
[1:00:49] way but they wouldn't be praying in
[1:00:51] faith this is the mental it was
[1:00:53] reasonable now we'll pray physically
[1:00:54] this way but Jonah by faith became a
[1:00:56] paradox and God heard his prayer and he
[1:00:59] got released out of whale's belly
[1:01:01] Hallelujah but you see in order in order
[1:01:04] to be see in order to see a paradox we
[1:01:07] must become a paradox or if you're a
[1:01:09] Believer you already are a paradox
[1:01:10] see It'll become in order to take a
[1:01:13] Rapture to see the dead in Christ rise
[1:01:15] it'll be the biggest Paradox the world
[1:01:17] has ever seen
[1:01:18] now we just on um you know on Tuesday
[1:01:22] there was Anzac Day we commemorate the
[1:01:24] you know the for yeah you know the
[1:01:26] anzacs you know with the you know new
[1:01:28] zealanders they first fought in
[1:01:29] Gallipoli then the Western Front and we
[1:01:32] know this nation to a lot of you
[1:01:33] probably doesn't mean a lot but you know
[1:01:35] in this nation the Anzac Day means a lot
[1:01:37] because it's part of our founding
[1:01:40] um founding events of this of this
[1:01:42] country as we know it where where New
[1:01:44] Zealand soldiers would fight actually
[1:01:46] under the command of New Zealand uh
[1:01:49] officers are not under the British now
[1:01:51] we know that they went to Gallipoli and
[1:01:52] the campaign was was and you know
[1:01:55] absolute failure where where they had
[1:01:58] one last push you know when you go look
[1:01:59] at the papa they're the uh uh exhibition
[1:02:02] they had one last push to take The High
[1:02:04] Ground of China and and it was actually
[1:02:07] the Wellington it was actually the
[1:02:08] Wellington the Battalion that took that
[1:02:10] hill and they and they held it for as
[1:02:12] long as they could but they lost so many
[1:02:14] men they were relieved by by actually
[1:02:16] some British and unfortunately the the
[1:02:19] um the the Turks had a counter-offensive
[1:02:21] and they're pushed off the hill and um
[1:02:24] after that failure they knew that they
[1:02:25] couldn't actually take that high ground
[1:02:27] and take the peninsula so so they had to
[1:02:29] withdraw
[1:02:30] but a big part of that failure was
[1:02:33] actually friendly fire from from British
[1:02:35] artillery so so the Wellington Battalion
[1:02:38] they took China beer but then it was
[1:02:39] actually the British artillery which
[1:02:41] actually took out their commanding
[1:02:42] officer who was a Christian man and you
[1:02:44] know you know all those kind of things
[1:02:45] happen now I say that because because we
[1:02:49] are on our way upper mountains we're
[1:02:51] here to take a high ground you know to
[1:02:53] climb a mountain where you know you go
[1:02:55] from faith and patience and virtue and
[1:02:57] knowledge and all those things up to
[1:02:58] Divine love and once we reach Divine
[1:03:01] love then the resurrection happens when
[1:03:02] the church is full of divine love
[1:03:04] charity right I mean so there's a hill
[1:03:06] that we must climb amen and possess that
[1:03:08] High Ground now the first church aimed
[1:03:10] at that High Ground I mean they pray you
[1:03:13] know you know you know they were they
[1:03:15] were determined Amen to to take to to
[1:03:18] press the mark of the high calling in
[1:03:20] Christ they believe they were going to
[1:03:21] be that generation that would see the
[1:03:23] dead in Christ race amen when the
[1:03:25] Apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonians
[1:03:27] he wasn't saying you know two thousand
[1:03:29] years later this is going to happen he
[1:03:30] said we which are alive and remain I
[1:03:32] believe the Apostle Paul actually when
[1:03:34] he when he's inspired to write that the
[1:03:35] we he said I rejoicing saying that's me
[1:03:37] I mean but he didn't realize he was the
[1:03:39] part of the Dead in Christ was going to
[1:03:41] be he was going to be that part of that
[1:03:42] fulfillment so the church there in the
[1:03:44] Ephesian age they aimed at taking that
[1:03:45] high ground but because they were
[1:03:48] anointed Amen to actually Unfortunately
[1:03:50] they lived out their name of aiming at
[1:03:53] and to relax that's what if um Ephesus
[1:03:55] means to aim at but to relax so they
[1:03:57] anger that high calling but they relax
[1:03:59] and eventually they drifted and then
[1:04:01] eventually went went down to a dark age
[1:04:03] but God said he will restore and then
[1:04:06] now at this end time we've come back
[1:04:07] again amen and now we're not at the
[1:04:10] bottom of the hill we're actually right
[1:04:11] at the top amen but the devil doesn't
[1:04:13] want us to take the summit amen he wants
[1:04:16] to do every counter-attack he can aiming
[1:04:19] to push us off the summit when we start
[1:04:20] fussing we start fighting amen we just
[1:04:23] we just throw away any kind of Christian
[1:04:24] love any kind of forgiveness that's what
[1:04:26] he wants he wants us he wants us to be
[1:04:29] fussing and fighting holding grudges
[1:04:31] full of metals and strife and envy
[1:04:32] that's what the devil wants us to be
[1:04:34] amen and and if he can get us to be that
[1:04:37] way then what happens is we actually
[1:04:39] begin to retreat because hurt people
[1:04:42] Retreat within themselves right they can
[1:04:44] still be Christian doesn't mean we're
[1:04:45] not saved doesn't mean we're not going
[1:04:46] to Rapture but hurt people Retreat
[1:04:48] within themselves amen but God wants to
[1:04:51] work a paradox where where our hurts
[1:04:53] don't Define us but he defines us our
[1:04:56] identity is in the Lord our identities
[1:04:58] and our freedom in Christ Our identity
[1:05:00] is not in Friendly Fire and you know
[1:05:02] barrages of gospel malice and strife and
[1:05:04] all those things and pain to the past
[1:05:06] those things don't Define us he defines
[1:05:08] us amen amen so you know brother Brown
[1:05:11] would say that every age could only live
[1:05:12] according to their anointing so so when
[1:05:15] you go into the martyrdom age of the ox
[1:05:16] anointing there you know you know the
[1:05:18] Believers actually gladly gave
[1:05:20] themselves as a Living Sacrifice to be
[1:05:22] burnt at the stake to be tortured all
[1:05:23] those things they're anointed to
[1:05:25] overcome to go through that and give
[1:05:27] their lives they could only live
[1:05:29] according to that anointing but now just
[1:05:31] like the first age they can only live
[1:05:33] according to their anointing they
[1:05:34] couldn't actually aim at and become
[1:05:36] because the anointing of the age but now
[1:05:38] we can only live according to our
[1:05:40] anointing yeah and our anointing is an
[1:05:42] eagle anointing amen we can look from
[1:05:44] eternity to Eternity where we're not
[1:05:45] going to aim at and relax and then drift
[1:05:47] we're going to aim it and become because
[1:05:49] we're anointed to become it amen
[1:05:51] hallelujah just like unfortunately there
[1:05:53] you know the anzacs could never take
[1:05:55] chanukbir they could never take the high
[1:05:57] ground but we're anointed to take the
[1:05:59] high ground and now High Ground is not
[1:06:01] someplace in Turkey there but our high
[1:06:03] ground is a resurrection amen holu is to
[1:06:05] climb the summit here amen that's what
[1:06:07] we're anointed to do but it will take a
[1:06:09] paradox to do it amen because the
[1:06:12] enemy's weapons are very natural weapons
[1:06:14] amen sure he may be spiritual but he'll
[1:06:16] use natural unforgiveness natural pains
[1:06:19] natural hurts natural misunderstandings
[1:06:21] and he'll use those things to try and
[1:06:23] get us to withdraw within ourselves and
[1:06:25] just function as as Believers but not
[1:06:27] pressing forward but friends it's time
[1:06:29] actually to jump out of the trench and
[1:06:32] charge amen why it'll be a paradox amen
[1:06:35] but amen we can Quinn every fire he died
[1:06:37] of the enemy we can we can actually
[1:06:39] deflect every blow yes Hallelujah but it
[1:06:43] takes a paradox to do it what is that
[1:06:45] Paradox where we can turn the other
[1:06:46] cheek I mean we can actually forgive
[1:06:49] amen it's a paradox actually not to hold
[1:06:51] a grudge it's a paradox not to in this
[1:06:53] age where where we're so connected with
[1:06:55] social media what does social media do
[1:06:58] you can murder someone's character all
[1:07:00] around the world with one tweet or one
[1:07:03] post or one Instagram thing it makes it
[1:07:05] so easy to do that but it'll be a
[1:07:06] paradox for people not to fall into that
[1:07:09] trap and not do it yeah because it's
[1:07:11] unreasonable to hell because we are
[1:07:13] actually swimming against the tide of
[1:07:16] culture Hallelujah and it's a paradox
[1:07:18] that'll take us to do it
[1:07:20] Hallelujah
[1:07:22] amen so I I believe I'm looking at the
[1:07:24] people that are going to take The High
[1:07:25] Ground
[1:07:26] and not just take it but hold it amen
[1:07:28] until we get extracted hallelujah amen
[1:07:32] praise the Lord why because we're living
[1:07:34] by the anointing of the Holy Ghost to do
[1:07:36] it now Samson was inspired to pick up
[1:07:39] that Jawbone you think about that he
[1:07:40] always breaks the flax there and no
[1:07:43] doubt he begins looking around for a
[1:07:44] weapon because the Philistines are
[1:07:45] shouting at him that you know they're
[1:07:47] all around him but he's inspired maybe
[1:07:49] there was rocks there maybe there was
[1:07:50] bits of wood maybe different things but
[1:07:52] he's inspired not to pick up a rock but
[1:07:54] to pick up a Jawbone yeah I mean see
[1:07:56] because now naturally it did not look
[1:07:58] like a weapon it was not a weapon to
[1:08:01] face men that had bronze brass helmets
[1:08:03] and Shields and things as brothers I
[1:08:05] read that quote it just would have
[1:08:06] smashed the pieces the first blow but
[1:08:09] the thing is God looks beyond the
[1:08:11] outside amen he doesn't look at the
[1:08:13] outside man he looks at the inside man
[1:08:15] yeah amen God never looks on how tall we
[1:08:18] are how strong we are how well we can
[1:08:20] talk our vocabulary he doesn't look at
[1:08:22] any of those things everybody looks at
[1:08:24] the human heart that's why God being the
[1:08:25] god of paradoxes uses us to show his
[1:08:28] paradoxes I mean because he wants to
[1:08:30] show us that actually we are not built I
[1:08:33] mean we are not Believers because of
[1:08:34] anything we can bring we can just bring
[1:08:36] a Hallelujah
[1:08:37] as we as we read amen lift up our hands
[1:08:39] and praise him again and again
[1:08:41] Hallelujah see Moses and Pharaoh looked
[1:08:45] at the same people they looked at Israel
[1:08:47] as slaves Pharaoh just saw slaves he
[1:08:50] just saw a tool to build some monuments
[1:08:52] you know he didn't see people he didn't
[1:08:54] see Egyptians he didn't even see you
[1:08:56] know he saw people he valued less than
[1:08:58] his horses or as or as prized positions
[1:09:01] they were just tools if they died while
[1:09:03] they died that's just a lost Widow it's
[1:09:04] not even accountable who cares about
[1:09:06] them but see Moses looked out the same
[1:09:08] window Pharaoh did but he saw God's
[1:09:10] promised people amen he saw God's
[1:09:12] children now that to me is a paradox
[1:09:14] where naturally they look like man
[1:09:16] they're defeated their God has left them
[1:09:18] they're useless they're just nothing
[1:09:19] more than slaves but to look at them and
[1:09:22] say this is God's prized possession this
[1:09:25] this is God's chosen ones from all the
[1:09:27] Earth these are God's chosen people amen
[1:09:30] and Moses looked at them and saw these
[1:09:32] people will fulfill God's promises amen
[1:09:35] so that was a paradox but now there's
[1:09:37] also a paradox for Moses when you think
[1:09:39] about him he was 80 years old when God
[1:09:41] called him and normally when people are
[1:09:43] 80 years old that's when they really
[1:09:45] stayed in their ways they always do what
[1:09:47] they've always done then they get into a
[1:09:48] real routine right but it was a paradox
[1:09:51] for God to call them at that age not at
[1:09:53] a young age right so so that was himself
[1:09:55] was a paradox as God was going to make
[1:09:57] him the Paradox and then do a paradox
[1:10:00] through him just like he does you and I
[1:10:02] he makes us the Paradox whatever age we
[1:10:04] are and the and the manifests of paradox
[1:10:06] through us I trust you're with me this
[1:10:08] morning amen see Moses saw God's
[1:10:11] promised people
[1:10:12] and it was unreasonable but yet it was
[1:10:15] true right Moses went down one-man
[1:10:17] Invasion imagine him turning up at the
[1:10:19] turning up at the Customs border there
[1:10:21] when he's going down into Egypt you know
[1:10:23] he's filling out the form you know
[1:10:25] what's your purpose of travel
[1:10:27] visiting relatives well yes that's true
[1:10:29] business conference is kind of business
[1:10:31] trip other and he writes Invasion he
[1:10:34] gives it to the passport by the Customs
[1:10:36] guy Stone Face reads this he just thinks
[1:10:39] crazy old man stamp stamp enjoy your
[1:10:41] stay he's probably I'm going to enjoy my
[1:10:43] stay you know one-man Invasion 80 year
[1:10:46] old man with a staff in his hand I
[1:10:48] remember the thing is he did it it was a
[1:10:49] paradox I mean one one spear one even
[1:10:52] little rookie recruit with a sword could
[1:10:54] have ended the whole thing Egyptian
[1:10:56] Soldier I mean could it but it was a
[1:10:58] paradox he went in there amen and he
[1:11:00] delivered a million odd people however
[1:11:01] many it was that itself was a paradox
[1:11:04] hallelujah amen amen now see on the
[1:11:07] outward Pharaoh did not realize what
[1:11:09] these people were capable of I mean
[1:11:11] because because when God saw them he he
[1:11:14] saw his promised people now outwardly
[1:11:17] Caleb and Joshua looked like any other
[1:11:19] men yeah you know they were slaves they
[1:11:22] had their Huts they had their food like
[1:11:23] anyone else they had their work they had
[1:11:25] to do but on the inside of them
[1:11:28] was a paradox I mean there was a paradox
[1:11:31] on on the inside of Caleb and Joshua
[1:11:33] because on the inside of Joshua was a
[1:11:35] faith to stop the Sun and the Moon I
[1:11:38] don't know how it happened I just
[1:11:39] believed it did I don't know the science
[1:11:40] behind it or the mechanics but I believe
[1:11:42] the Dynamics of it it really happened
[1:11:44] amen so so within it was a paradox to
[1:11:47] make that happen amen within him was a
[1:11:49] paradox to give his life over to the
[1:11:51] captain of the host of the Lord to
[1:11:52] follow his battle instructions to Cross
[1:11:54] Jordan amen and take Jericho amen and do
[1:11:57] all those things that was a paradox it
[1:12:00] was a paradox where God told them no one
[1:12:02] will be able to stand before you all the
[1:12:03] days of your life
[1:12:04] that's a paradox
[1:12:06] he was unbeatable Joshua was unbeatable
[1:12:08] you think of General's great you know
[1:12:10] great generals that fought battles they
[1:12:12] never you know there's very few that had
[1:12:14] a record like Joshua
[1:12:16] that didn't have the equipment to
[1:12:18] actually have the invasion in the first
[1:12:19] place but he did it yeah yeah it was a
[1:12:22] paradox you know we think about us we
[1:12:24] look at the natural things we have amen
[1:12:25] but really God is our supplier God is
[1:12:29] our God is the material Giver amen
[1:12:31] remember Joshua did not have Siege
[1:12:33] equipment he didn't have you know I
[1:12:35] don't know if he did it but maybe he was
[1:12:37] looking at all of his weapons and stuff
[1:12:38] before they crossed Jordan they knew
[1:12:40] they were going to Jericho if I'd gone
[1:12:42] to the Armory yeah he walks in hey what
[1:12:45] do we have do we have a battering ram
[1:12:47] sorry do we have any ladders
[1:12:51] This Tall
[1:12:53] maybe they had a couple of ladders
[1:12:56] okay do we have do we have any um
[1:12:58] assault Tower things no
[1:13:02] do we have catapult that probably say
[1:13:04] what's a catapult yeah they had nothing
[1:13:06] to take that City they had nothing right
[1:13:09] and many times we go to battle we think
[1:13:11] we have nothing but we have the one
[1:13:12] thing we need which is the Lord Jesus
[1:13:14] Christ he will make something out of
[1:13:16] nothing I mean so he knew that God would
[1:13:18] give them the victory but he just had to
[1:13:20] seek the mind of the Lord until he found
[1:13:23] how God to do it I mean you know how God
[1:13:25] would charm that's why he went out was
[1:13:27] meditating he was praying no doubt oh
[1:13:28] great Jehovah God he told me as as you
[1:13:31] were with Moses you'll be with me now
[1:13:33] here's this obstacle I can't I've got to
[1:13:35] take the city it opens up the whole
[1:13:36] Promised Land amen but how can I take
[1:13:38] this city and when he is singing on The
[1:13:40] Lord that's when the captain of the
[1:13:42] house of the Lord came down to say I've
[1:13:43] come to take over this whole campaign
[1:13:45] not just this battle but the whole of
[1:13:47] your walk the whole of your walk with me
[1:13:50] I'm going to take over the whole thing
[1:13:52] and that's what God does when he comes
[1:13:53] down into your life he's not just to
[1:13:55] help you he's here to take over is it a
[1:13:57] take over your human battle take over
[1:14:00] all the Temptations All the Troubles all
[1:14:01] the things you'll go through he's come
[1:14:03] to take it over and not just for one
[1:14:05] instance but for every instance until
[1:14:07] you leave this earth Hallelujah for so
[1:14:10] it's a paradox now Caleb Caleb was
[1:14:13] probably the biggest paradox in that
[1:14:15] whole story
[1:14:17] me don't think you know Josh was
[1:14:19] stopping the Sun and the Moon to think
[1:14:20] no no Caleb was to me the biggest
[1:14:23] paradox
[1:14:24] Caleb wasn't even an Israelite he was a
[1:14:27] kennesite he wasn't even part of Judah
[1:14:30] he was he was a gentile
[1:14:33] and his name Caleb means dog
[1:14:35] so God is going to show a paradox and a
[1:14:39] man who's called a dog who's not even an
[1:14:41] Israelite oh look this is how God works
[1:14:45] I mean so here's Caleb no doubt maybe
[1:14:48] he's growing up he was a hard dog throw
[1:14:50] him a stick you know make fun of him but
[1:14:52] God was showing even someone who's
[1:14:53] called a dog a paradox is gonna happen
[1:14:55] and that's why the woman the
[1:14:57] seraphenician woman who came to Jesus
[1:14:59] his daughter was grievously vexed with
[1:15:00] the devil oh son of David have mercy on
[1:15:03] me and your other disciples saying
[1:15:04] they're calling after us and Jesus says
[1:15:06] send her away and you know but but she
[1:15:08] had a faith to work a paradox amen and
[1:15:11] yo and Jesus even called her a dog so
[1:15:12] it's not meat to give the bread or
[1:15:14] whatever to the dogs you know but she
[1:15:16] said yay Lord but even the dogs get the
[1:15:18] crumbs from the table it was just a
[1:15:20] crumb of a blessing liberated her
[1:15:22] daughter
[1:15:23] I mean how much more life that God gives
[1:15:25] us amen of His blessings and his
[1:15:27] goodness what can it do amen so you know
[1:15:30] here was here was Caleb he was called a
[1:15:32] dog see God's joke I'm going to use a
[1:15:34] dog I'm going to use those who are not
[1:15:35] the princes of the world I'm not going
[1:15:38] to use the great ones to work my Paradox
[1:15:41] see Caleb and Joshua they saw the same
[1:15:43] Giants they saw the same land they saw
[1:15:45] the same troubles amen but you know yeah
[1:15:48] so so they could have agreed with most
[1:15:50] of the other 10 spiers report
[1:15:52] but what they disagreed with us is is
[1:15:55] the other 10 spy said no we can't take
[1:15:57] it Caleb and Josh said no doubt they
[1:15:59] would have been tearing out there here
[1:16:01] what do you mean Brothers
[1:16:03] what do you mean we can't take this land
[1:16:04] we're more than able to take it because
[1:16:06] God's given it to us amen so that would
[1:16:08] have been you know so so now for 40
[1:16:10] years Caleb was a walking paradox
[1:16:12] he had tasted the land he had had the
[1:16:15] grapes he had seen it you know I believe
[1:16:16] when he was walking through the land
[1:16:18] something spoke to him said that
[1:16:19] mountain yeah
[1:16:20] that's my Mountain not just any mountain
[1:16:23] that one's mine I mean that Mountain's
[1:16:25] mine so for 40 years no doubt he'd tell
[1:16:28] his family what do you think was a
[1:16:29] dinner conversation it wasn't about the
[1:16:32] sand and the and the manner and what
[1:16:35] this other tent's doing and this tribe's
[1:16:37] doing this and these fusses going on
[1:16:39] here in the church this is going on you
[1:16:41] know troubles are like sand they blow in
[1:16:44] and they blow out yeah and they blow in
[1:16:47] and they blow out what's the best thing
[1:16:49] to do open the if they blow in just open
[1:16:51] the other side of the tent let them blow
[1:16:53] out so trouble come to the head you know
[1:16:55] what sister a brother so-and-so didn't
[1:16:56] this person said this troubles coming in
[1:16:59] you just opened the other side of the
[1:17:00] tent how do you do that father forgive
[1:17:02] them they don't know what they do I love
[1:17:03] them we're part of the same body it just
[1:17:04] blows out that's a good thing to do but
[1:17:07] some people they just let sand collect
[1:17:08] in their tent let it blow out let the
[1:17:11] Holy Ghost just blow it out this morning
[1:17:12] I mean let them let them take all those
[1:17:14] things away but see Caleb see Caleb was
[1:17:17] living in the same place everyone else
[1:17:19] was living but then in his tent there
[1:17:21] would have been such an anointing I
[1:17:22] believe of faith
[1:17:24] children Hallelujah no doubt they say I
[1:17:27] know what pops is going to tell us
[1:17:29] tonight
[1:17:30] you know I crossed that Jordan
[1:17:32] I saw the green fields I saw I saw what
[1:17:35] what was promised to Abraham I was
[1:17:38] walking on the same ground Abraham was
[1:17:39] walking on though he wasn't my father
[1:17:41] something in me says I'm a child of
[1:17:43] Faith like he's the father of the faith
[1:17:45] honey and I was walking there around in
[1:17:47] the promised land amen I saw the fields
[1:17:49] I Saw The Meadows I saw the streams I
[1:17:51] saw these things but then when I saw a
[1:17:53] particular Mountain
[1:17:55] something said that's your Mountain dad
[1:17:58] tell us about that what's the city like
[1:18:00] well it's got big walls it's got big
[1:18:02] doors why is that because it's got
[1:18:04] Giants there yeah yeah amen the sons of
[1:18:07] Anika there see God wants to work a
[1:18:09] paradox many times the devil sits on
[1:18:12] your biggest blessing
[1:18:13] he will sit on your biggest blessing now
[1:18:16] if you let him drive you away with
[1:18:17] discouragement he'll stay there but if
[1:18:19] you have in your heart no that
[1:18:21] blessing's mine that promise in the
[1:18:23] scripture's mine doesn't matter what
[1:18:25] devil tries to say it's not for you
[1:18:26] those days of Miracles have passed God
[1:18:28] doesn't move like that anymore there's
[1:18:30] too many people in the church we can't
[1:18:31] have a holy ghost meeting anymore get
[1:18:33] that out of your head I mean God is
[1:18:35] still God he's a god of Miracles he'll
[1:18:37] work a paradox if we let him work a
[1:18:39] paradox I mean so yo Caleb remember he's
[1:18:43] he's old he's not a spring chicken
[1:18:45] anymore you know he's getting up in age
[1:18:48] he was about 80 odd years old when they
[1:18:49] crossed the Jordan to take the land
[1:18:51] but for all this time he's saying give
[1:18:53] me my mountain
[1:18:55] give me my mountain and maybe his
[1:18:57] children were going to think man he's
[1:18:58] just praying the same old prayer thank
[1:18:59] you Jesus thank you Jehovah thank you
[1:19:02] for my inheritance in the Promised Land
[1:19:04] but it was a paradox because he got it
[1:19:07] he got it now he would he would be he
[1:19:11] would gain an inheritance among the
[1:19:14] children of Judah this is what it says
[1:19:16] in Joshua 15 and 13.
[1:19:19] now Judah means praise it's important
[1:19:22] when you think about where people are
[1:19:24] placed yeah he would he did not get a he
[1:19:26] did not get inheritance among the tribe
[1:19:28] of Manasseh Manasseh means causes to
[1:19:31] forget
[1:19:32] like like Gideon was of the tribe of
[1:19:34] Manasseh Gideon means a mighty warrior
[1:19:37] but he had forgotten who he was
[1:19:39] and why because he's living under his
[1:19:41] tribal name because because when the
[1:19:43] angel came to him yo he's threshing
[1:19:45] wheat he says get in your Mighty Man of
[1:19:48] Valor he's basically just telling him
[1:19:50] the meaning of his name but Gideon
[1:19:52] stretching wheat in secret afraid why
[1:19:54] he's forgotten who he is
[1:19:56] amen so now Judah means praise this is
[1:19:59] why this is why Caleb who's a dog a
[1:20:01] gentile dog has an inheritance among a
[1:20:04] tribe who means praise Hallelujah
[1:20:06] because when you know when God brings
[1:20:08] you in it should produce a praise
[1:20:10] Hallelujah Rahab was a moabite the law
[1:20:13] said she had she could not enter the
[1:20:15] congregation of Israel no motorbike
[1:20:16] could amen but Grace overshadowed the
[1:20:19] law and then she married to Boaz who was
[1:20:22] of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah now now
[1:20:26] Rahab no sorry Ruth Ruth her
[1:20:30] her mum-in-law and dad-in-law their
[1:20:32] names together mean Pleasant worship
[1:20:35] so when they came into Moab they saw
[1:20:37] Pleasant worship being lived out I
[1:20:39] believe it drew her
[1:20:41] and it actually carried her through when
[1:20:42] when they died her husband died all
[1:20:44] those things happened right so now she
[1:20:46] saw Pleasant worship but then now she
[1:20:49] came into Judah begin to manifest praise
[1:20:52] why because Grace allowed her to come in
[1:20:55] amen Rahab Rahab became part of the
[1:20:58] tribe of Judah Hallelujah why what
[1:21:00] happened the token was applied her
[1:21:02] family came in the walls were destroyed
[1:21:04] Amy what did it do it generated priests
[1:21:06] I'm free I'm not stuck in this prison
[1:21:09] anymore I'm not under a death sentence
[1:21:11] anymore I found Mercy In This Place
[1:21:13] hallelujah what happened it produces
[1:21:16] praise I trust yeah I think some of you
[1:21:18] can agree with me amen we were destined
[1:21:20] for destruction but God said no you're
[1:21:22] not going there that's not your
[1:21:23] inheritance that's not your portion and
[1:21:26] I'm going to bring you into Green
[1:21:27] Pastures I'm going to bring you to a
[1:21:29] place by The Still Waters I'm going to a
[1:21:30] place where your soul is fed which is
[1:21:32] the word of God not of not a building
[1:21:33] amen we understand that Holy and what
[1:21:36] should that produce such a praise Lord
[1:21:38] You Found Me Lord you did a paradox in
[1:21:40] my life you know
[1:21:42] I would never come to a place like this
[1:21:44] I'll be serious before I met the Lord
[1:21:46] I'd never come to a church I was very
[1:21:48] reluctant even to step into one
[1:21:50] well there's a paradigm God had to do a
[1:21:52] paradox in my life amen and bring me
[1:21:54] into a place like this praise the Lord
[1:21:56] hallelujah words so when now we become a
[1:21:59] living paradox
[1:22:01] Hallelujah
[1:22:03] praise the Lord
[1:22:05] Hallelujah now
[1:22:08] there and they're in Jericho
[1:22:11] there was a man called blind Bartimaeus
[1:22:13] and I shared a thing a bit about him
[1:22:14] last time
[1:22:15] he became a living paradox
[1:22:18] there he was blind man begging on the
[1:22:21] street Jesus was actually walking
[1:22:23] towards Calvary
[1:22:24] but yet has he began to call out when he
[1:22:27] heard the testimonies of what the Lord
[1:22:28] did because remember when he was raised
[1:22:31] as a boy his Mum would tell him about
[1:22:32] Joshua and Caleb and Elijah and Elisha
[1:22:36] and all the and Rahab all the great
[1:22:37] things that happened in his City and
[1:22:39] said that same Jehovah God is alive
[1:22:41] today
[1:22:43] amen so he had that in his heart
[1:22:44] believing actually God is still God and
[1:22:47] then when he heard that big tumult of
[1:22:49] Jesus going by because there's always
[1:22:50] noise where Jesus is you know some
[1:22:52] people were crying out Hosanna and
[1:22:54] praise God and God's visitors you know
[1:22:56] how amazing this is others were crying
[1:22:58] out your beelze above get away from this
[1:23:00] fellow have nothing to do with them and
[1:23:01] you know this is a great bunch of noise
[1:23:03] going on and blind butter May has heard
[1:23:05] this tumult go past him and and it had
[1:23:07] already gone past him by the time
[1:23:09] someone said to him actually answered
[1:23:11] him because he's saying what's going on
[1:23:12] what's this noise who's going by he
[1:23:15] heard a lot of other people go by before
[1:23:16] but this was different I trust when
[1:23:18] Jesus comes by your way you realize this
[1:23:20] is different amen this is not just
[1:23:22] another day this is your day Hallelujah
[1:23:24] so now here he was you're crying out
[1:23:27] someone began to say to them oh blind
[1:23:28] bottom ass you know
[1:23:30] there's noise that you're hearing it
[1:23:32] says Jesus of Nazareth amen that's going
[1:23:34] by maybe he'd ask you know what did this
[1:23:36] Jesus do why is this all this about him
[1:23:39] and what's going on and people crying
[1:23:40] out son of David all these things and
[1:23:42] you know this person we're going to
[1:23:43] testify to him Lazarus was dead four
[1:23:46] days he came back to life you know the
[1:23:48] dead you know you know death can hear
[1:23:50] the blind can see all these things we
[1:23:51] can realize this is Messiah walking past
[1:23:54] me amen this is the son of David amen
[1:23:57] here's a living Paradox coming by this
[1:23:58] is the god of Joshua the god of Elijah
[1:24:01] the god of Elisha the god of Rahab amen
[1:24:04] was walking past him and then so he
[1:24:06] began to cry out and people say shh
[1:24:08] be quiet you know you're just causing
[1:24:10] too much of a fuss but he cried out all
[1:24:12] the more the Bible said but it was
[1:24:14] actually his faith sometimes you've got
[1:24:16] to be noisy for Faith to project right
[1:24:19] sure you can be quiet but sometimes
[1:24:20] you've got to really cry out get next to
[1:24:22] yourself amen let God take over amen so
[1:24:25] and then in the Bible says then Jesus
[1:24:27] Stood Still
[1:24:28] so his faith caused the son to stop
[1:24:33] just like with now now Joshua's Faith
[1:24:36] caused the s-u-n to stop but brother man
[1:24:40] says it was the same kind of faith that
[1:24:42] Joshua had is the same kind of faith
[1:24:44] that blown by the man's had I mean
[1:24:46] because one one stop the natural sun and
[1:24:48] moon amen but now here is a faith that
[1:24:50] stopped the Son of God greater than the
[1:24:53] son amen but the one that the sun
[1:24:54] symbolizes was upon the earth and the
[1:24:57] same Faith Joshua used to stop the Sun
[1:24:58] and the Moon blind Bartimaeus had to
[1:25:01] stop the son on his way to Calvary that
[1:25:04] he would meet his need amen because many
[1:25:06] times think isn't that incredible the
[1:25:07] sun and the moon will stop but you know
[1:25:09] you're saying Faith the same Faith you
[1:25:10] have actually causes Jesus to stop and
[1:25:13] hear your petition and meet your need
[1:25:15] and answer your prayer Hallelujah I'm
[1:25:18] looking at a people who are living
[1:25:19] Paradox as much as Joshua was why
[1:25:22] because we have the same kind of faith I
[1:25:24] mean when Jesus is walking through seven
[1:25:25] Church ages right I mean we're here in
[1:25:27] the end of the lady of cnh he's walking
[1:25:29] from here and he's going to keep walking
[1:25:31] up into Glory what in his bride His Holy
[1:25:34] Ghost is going to lift off the Earth
[1:25:36] amen because he's you know in Book of
[1:25:37] Revelation he says I sort of like the
[1:25:39] son of man walking among the seven
[1:25:40] golden candlesticks that wasn't the
[1:25:42] physical body of Jesus walking through
[1:25:44] seven Church ages it was him Christ and
[1:25:46] the people walking through seven Church
[1:25:48] ages so he's walking the son of man is
[1:25:50] walking through this age on his way to a
[1:25:53] rapture
[1:25:54] but then your faith says have mercy on
[1:25:56] me I see the world is falling apart I
[1:25:59] see your troubles on every hand nuclear
[1:26:01] war is going to happen there must but
[1:26:03] there must be Mercy in this place for me
[1:26:05] while judgment's about to fall what's
[1:26:06] happening causes him to stand still
[1:26:09] go get him holy boy because Jesus called
[1:26:12] blown by the mass to come to him
[1:26:14] Hallelujah as we heard they're an Easter
[1:26:16] he dropped his biggest garment because
[1:26:18] he wouldn't need it anymore amen
[1:26:21] hallelujah then he walked away being
[1:26:23] able to see what happened he became a
[1:26:25] paradox Amen in the same Faith Joshua
[1:26:28] had amen blind Bartimaeus had he didn't
[1:26:31] he didn't stay blind bottom ass he was
[1:26:33] just bottom ass from then on Amen see
[1:26:35] you see how physical condition shouldn't
[1:26:37] Define us our emotional spiritual you
[1:26:40] know you know we'll be hurting our
[1:26:41] spirit but we shouldn't be hurting
[1:26:43] whatever your name is hurting brother
[1:26:45] hurting sister you know blind
[1:26:48] whatever spiritually no no we should
[1:26:50] just be our names
[1:26:51] or it should be redeemed hallelujah
[1:26:53] praise the Lord amen now
[1:26:57] so you can see the kind of people God
[1:26:59] you know David David was a man after
[1:27:01] God's Own Heart but he wasn't born
[1:27:03] perfect so you know some might think the
[1:27:06] reason David was a man after God's Own
[1:27:08] Heart because he was perfect but David
[1:27:10] wasn't perfect no he wasn't born perfect
[1:27:13] he wasn't he wasn't perfect in all of
[1:27:16] his ways that's why he was anointed no
[1:27:17] he was just a teenage boy
[1:27:20] probably being silly and everything like
[1:27:22] other teenage boys are right but his
[1:27:25] heart was he wanted to do God's will he
[1:27:28] loved the Lord that's what made the
[1:27:29] difference amen that's why you know I
[1:27:32] think when when when Jesse was um
[1:27:34] calling his calling his sons he didn't
[1:27:37] even include David
[1:27:38] he's just uh was that llamaki you know
[1:27:41] you know he he's the late one you know
[1:27:44] there's a gap maybe with the sons then
[1:27:45] there's David you know he's not even
[1:27:47] he's not even going to be he's not
[1:27:49] important enough but God doesn't look on
[1:27:51] the outward he looks at the heart so he
[1:27:52] David was brought in he was anointed and
[1:27:55] then he was anointed and then it would
[1:27:57] say of him you know in Acts 13 22 and
[1:28:00] when he had removed them speaking of
[1:28:01] Saul he raised up under him David to be
[1:28:04] their King to whom also he gave
[1:28:05] testimony said I have found David the
[1:28:07] son of Jesse a man after my own heart
[1:28:09] which shall fulfill all of my will
[1:28:12] Hallelujah and that's actually why God
[1:28:14] has anointed you and I am we've been
[1:28:16] anointed by a Vindicated word amen I
[1:28:18] mean we've been anointed by the Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost right what does that do why
[1:28:21] because God looks beyond this God even
[1:28:24] looks beyond how we perceive ourselves
[1:28:25] and he actually sees the people that
[1:28:27] have have a heart that all of his will
[1:28:29] would be done not just a part of his
[1:28:31] will not just saying a sinner's prayer
[1:28:34] and continuing waiting on and sin but
[1:28:36] those who want all of his word fulfilled
[1:28:38] Amen to repent be baptized in the name
[1:28:40] of Jesus Christ receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:41] dress in a hole in this way all those
[1:28:43] different things it's our heart that boy
[1:28:45] because it's in us to fulfill all of his
[1:28:47] will Hallelujah
[1:28:49] amen but you see David became a paradox
[1:28:53] because we know we know that Israel was
[1:28:55] all eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
[1:28:57] right it's all about revenge and David
[1:29:00] had opportunities to kill Saul but yet
[1:29:03] he became a paradox because he realized
[1:29:05] that he wasn't looking for kingship but
[1:29:07] God anointed him to become king and if
[1:29:10] God had raised not to become king then
[1:29:12] God will actually cause Saul to be taken
[1:29:14] off the scene he doesn't physically need
[1:29:16] to put his hand to it to get rid of Saul
[1:29:18] now that is a paradox
[1:29:21] praise the Lord amen he became a living
[1:29:23] Paradox why because well you know
[1:29:26] because he began to think differently to
[1:29:28] how man naturally thinks remember his
[1:29:30] men said now's your opportunity he's
[1:29:31] asleep you can pin him to the ground
[1:29:33] with his own spear finish the whole
[1:29:35] thing you should be king God anointed
[1:29:37] you King and then no no David thought
[1:29:39] well you know he's taken my wife McCall
[1:29:42] from me he's killed the priests I've
[1:29:44] been on the run all these years I've had
[1:29:46] all these troubles most of the Psalms
[1:29:47] when he's crying at us because Saul's
[1:29:49] after him right all that pain would be
[1:29:52] actually would actually produce praise
[1:29:54] in his life yeah we can draw strength
[1:29:57] from his pain
[1:29:59] praise the Lord my God my God why is our
[1:30:01] forsaken me all these troubles now my
[1:30:03] enemies are around me and yeah you know
[1:30:05] my pillows wet with my tears all these
[1:30:07] things he experienced those things he
[1:30:09] lived out the sound before he wrote it
[1:30:11] down but God but but you see he became a
[1:30:13] paradox because those things didn't
[1:30:15] him they made him stronger and
[1:30:18] because because it made him stronger we
[1:30:19] can draw from that strength because
[1:30:21] remember when all those things were
[1:30:22] going on it wasn't David being
[1:30:24] manifested it was Christ and David being
[1:30:27] manifested that's why the Psalms are not
[1:30:29] really the Psalms of David they're
[1:30:30] actually the Psalms of God
[1:30:32] Hallelujah it should be the same things
[1:30:34] with us that now when pain comes into
[1:30:36] our life we give it to God it actually
[1:30:37] becomes a strength to someone else right
[1:30:40] hardship comes an excessive Christ is
[1:30:41] manifested out of our lives
[1:30:43] praise the lord we can become a paradox
[1:30:46] I mean just like the you know Gates of
[1:30:48] the gates of the city I'm gonna I'm
[1:30:50] gonna kind of wind this up soon about
[1:30:52] Too Close you know the gates of the New
[1:30:54] Jerusalem are Pearl we know pearls are
[1:30:56] made because of an irritant gets into a
[1:30:59] you know shellfish it produces a pill
[1:31:01] right so so our our irritations of life
[1:31:04] should actually just produce an entrance
[1:31:06] into God's blessings
[1:31:08] amen even if you're upset by your own
[1:31:10] personality it should just be an
[1:31:12] entrance into God's blessings
[1:31:14] glory amen everything in life should be
[1:31:16] actually an entrance into God's
[1:31:17] blessings it's not CC trials and
[1:31:20] troubles aren't designed to keep us away
[1:31:22] from God they're actually designed to
[1:31:24] bring us closer to God Amen brother
[1:31:26] Brown says if you you know if you have
[1:31:29] trials and troubles actually it's
[1:31:30] because you found favor with God
[1:31:33] glory amen job found favor with god he's
[1:31:36] a perfect man in all the Earth there's
[1:31:37] none like him that was God's testimony
[1:31:39] of Joe and what happened he had the
[1:31:40] biggest trial probably anyone's ever had
[1:31:42] in their whole life why because he found
[1:31:43] favor with God
[1:31:45] see you know you know God didn't say to
[1:31:47] Satan well I hope you didn't see job
[1:31:48] when you're walking along I'm
[1:31:50] embarrassed of my son no he's a perfect
[1:31:51] man he pointed him out God pointed him
[1:31:54] out to the devil hallelujah amen what
[1:31:56] but but job became a living Paradox amen
[1:31:59] the Hebrew children and the furnace they
[1:32:01] became a living Paradox but the Paradox
[1:32:03] to me was incredible which was
[1:32:05] unreasonable but yet true well that's
[1:32:07] just the definition was that was that
[1:32:08] they said well if we burn we burn if not
[1:32:10] well but we're still you know if God
[1:32:12] Saves us yes praise God if not was done
[1:32:15] we're still not going to bow
[1:32:17] humanly that was unreasonable
[1:32:19] because basically Nebuchadnezzar was
[1:32:21] saying them boys I'm going to give you
[1:32:22] another chance I like you you're very
[1:32:24] valuable to me I've trained you I've put
[1:32:26] a lot of energy into you and look what
[1:32:27] you're doing to me you're making me look
[1:32:29] silly yeah I'll give you another chance
[1:32:31] that's why he bought them before him
[1:32:32] trying to intimidate them to Bow even
[1:32:34] further but but but you know they just
[1:32:37] said well King live forever you know if
[1:32:40] we burn we burn if not God will save us
[1:32:42] but either way
[1:32:43] we're not bowing to this guy not bad to
[1:32:46] this image your your resemblance of
[1:32:48] Daniel isn't very good anyway
[1:32:50] but you know what I mean like they
[1:32:52] wouldn't that was a paradox that was
[1:32:54] incredible but yeah true and then when
[1:32:55] when I went into the furnace what
[1:32:57] happened they just had fellowship with
[1:32:59] the son of man with the Son of God
[1:33:01] hallelujah
[1:33:02] amen so I brought God down into the
[1:33:04] trial I mean Daniel in the Lion's Den
[1:33:06] was a paradox
[1:33:08] why because those lions were hungry they
[1:33:10] were they were they just eat people but
[1:33:12] yet Daniel God closed the mouths of
[1:33:14] those lines for Daniel to use a lion's
[1:33:16] mane as a pillow I mean it was and it
[1:33:19] was a paradox why because Daniel himself
[1:33:21] was a paradox first because he has a
[1:33:23] paradox because when he went to when he
[1:33:25] went down to Babylon he says I'm not
[1:33:27] going to defile myself with the king's
[1:33:28] meat I'm going to make my stand early
[1:33:30] and this is just how I am and he
[1:33:32] wouldn't compromise on anything amen so
[1:33:35] so he was a paradox first
[1:33:37] because it would be reasonable we've got
[1:33:39] to fit in look we're slaves our our
[1:33:42] country is destroyed we're Exiles here
[1:33:45] now we've just got to adapt and just
[1:33:47] survive and you know but Daniel said no
[1:33:49] no no no I'm a I'm a Hebrew I'm a son of
[1:33:52] Abraham I'm not doing what they do sure
[1:33:55] I have to learn their language sure I've
[1:33:57] got to you know know their customs and
[1:33:58] see how they operate but I'm not going
[1:34:00] to be partakers of what they do he
[1:34:02] became a living paradox
[1:34:03] praise the Lord aren't you glad you know
[1:34:05] if a man under the blood of bulls and
[1:34:07] goats in Exile can do that how about you
[1:34:08] and I with the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:34:11] amen God always gives us overcoming
[1:34:13] power
[1:34:13] hey man now there's another Paradox I'll
[1:34:16] just finish with this one
[1:34:18] I just finished with this one
[1:34:21] we live in Satan's highest achievement
[1:34:23] of civilization
[1:34:25] he has spent six thousand years I think
[1:34:27] making this world
[1:34:30] everything is made upon this Earth
[1:34:32] especially in the first world it's all
[1:34:33] in the third world now anyway to entice
[1:34:36] people
[1:34:37] to live in sin and unbelief
[1:34:39] this is what this world this world has
[1:34:41] been designed see this world is not a
[1:34:43] mistake
[1:34:44] this thing's not a mistake you know just
[1:34:47] like the printed printed word is not a
[1:34:49] mistake God ordained this at a certain
[1:34:51] time
[1:34:52] right right translate into English at a
[1:34:53] certain time you know brother brahma's
[1:34:55] first words you know recorded well we've
[1:34:57] got these new recording gadgets because
[1:34:59] they had just released the technology
[1:35:01] for recording from the military it was
[1:35:03] on wire recording it wasn't a mistake he
[1:35:05] said that first
[1:35:06] because the voice in the days of the
[1:35:08] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:35:09] begin to sound the mystery God shall be
[1:35:11] finished so it's had to be the days of
[1:35:12] his voice so the voice had to be
[1:35:13] recorded yeah so so all that all this
[1:35:16] technology is here it's not a mistake
[1:35:18] but the devil wants to use it to entice
[1:35:20] people to Blind them amen to what is
[1:35:23] actually happening upon the Earth so
[1:35:25] this is Satan's Eden he's actually put a
[1:35:27] lot of effort into this
[1:35:29] he's he's done a lot of hard long days
[1:35:31] sleepless nights to actually produce
[1:35:33] this world
[1:35:35] and we are built the same way as the
[1:35:37] rest of humanity hey we're still human
[1:35:40] okay yep some people still believe that
[1:35:42] I probably say at every service
[1:35:44] sometimes yeah we are still human we're
[1:35:48] going to realize we're human we cannot
[1:35:50] defeat the Devil with our mind we can't
[1:35:52] outsmart him he will always outsmart us
[1:35:54] amen the only way we can ever defeat him
[1:35:57] is by the anointing of God by the word
[1:35:58] of God that's the only way we will ever
[1:36:01] win we'll never win in your own ability
[1:36:03] well I've seen this before I know what
[1:36:04] to do no no no you should be on your
[1:36:06] knees saying Lord you delivered me once
[1:36:08] now deliver me again Lord I've seen your
[1:36:10] hand here and I want to see your hand
[1:36:11] here Lord I need you more now than I
[1:36:13] ever need you in all my days amen that's
[1:36:15] how we should be Lord I just need you
[1:36:16] more amen so then that's the only way
[1:36:19] we'll win if we keep that almost a
[1:36:21] desperation
[1:36:22] Lord I won't let you go till you bless
[1:36:25] me Lord I need more of you in my life
[1:36:27] Lord I want to see you live I don't want
[1:36:29] to live off just testimonies of years
[1:36:30] ago right but you're the same today
[1:36:32] we'll come live today this is what I
[1:36:34] need hallelujah amen so he's made the
[1:36:37] Satan's Edom it's to ensnare the whole
[1:36:39] world as it says I think in habakkuk one
[1:36:41] of those books there's a net that they
[1:36:43] worship to actually goes around the
[1:36:45] whole world and draws them in
[1:36:48] we have a we have the internet yeah
[1:36:51] it's actually entire it traps people in
[1:36:53] a web of social media and games and
[1:36:55] different things it traps people yeah
[1:36:57] right so the devil's made this world
[1:36:59] thinking I've got Humanity
[1:37:01] but the thing is he looks on the outward
[1:37:02] he doesn't see the gene seed of God
[1:37:05] that's placed in us and we can be up
[1:37:07] until our eyeballs Beyond and all those
[1:37:09] things you're going to be in the biggest
[1:37:11] gamer the biggest movie fiend drunk
[1:37:13] drugs whatever more you can be up to
[1:37:15] hearing it but God says I'm not afraid
[1:37:18] of what you can do devil
[1:37:19] I'm not intimidated by what you can put
[1:37:22] in front of my children amen if there's
[1:37:24] a seed there they're coming out holy if
[1:37:27] there's a seed there they can't stay
[1:37:28] there they must come out like the woman
[1:37:30] of the well no doubt the devil thought
[1:37:31] you know maybe the devil thought he
[1:37:33] doesn't need to send his imps to her
[1:37:35] anymore he's got her you know five
[1:37:38] husbands one she's living with they're
[1:37:40] not married all these things life is
[1:37:41] ruined the devil thinks I can just leave
[1:37:43] her be
[1:37:45] just like the thief on the cross well
[1:37:46] he's gonna die he's going to come to
[1:37:48] hell I've used him all these years as a
[1:37:50] thief and doing all horrible things to
[1:37:51] people maybe the devil thought I can
[1:37:53] just leave him there to die
[1:37:55] but God knew where that would be God
[1:37:57] knew the condition that be when when he
[1:38:00] would meet them you know God doesn't
[1:38:02] ever Panic if we step actually Into
[1:38:04] Darkness
[1:38:06] I can say if you're his You're Gonna
[1:38:07] Come
[1:38:08] The Prodigal Son you see how the father
[1:38:11] treated the son when he came home to me
[1:38:13] that's all Grace and I believe the
[1:38:16] father would have treated him the same
[1:38:17] way when he left
[1:38:19] amen so now the father had confidence my
[1:38:22] son's going to come home sure he's going
[1:38:23] to be like he's dead he's going to come
[1:38:25] back alive we're going to Rejoice but
[1:38:27] he's going to come home
[1:38:28] Hallelujah that's why when we pray we
[1:38:30] shouldn't pray out of fear we should
[1:38:32] pray out of Faith see job offered the
[1:38:35] lamb out of fear for his children he
[1:38:37] should have been off but at least he
[1:38:38] offered it right at least he prayed for
[1:38:39] them so I'm not saying don't pray if
[1:38:41] you're if you're scared pray anyway but
[1:38:43] don't pray out of fear oh Lord what's
[1:38:44] going on it should be Lord you're more
[1:38:46] than able to get them wherever they go
[1:38:49] whatever they do I believe goodness and
[1:38:50] mercy Lord send it on their Trail and
[1:38:52] bring them home to you amen because I'm
[1:38:54] not looking Lord on what I see what I
[1:38:56] hear how they treat me I'm looking to
[1:38:57] your word and that will produce a
[1:38:59] paradox and we stand on his word alone
[1:39:01] and produces a paradox amen God does
[1:39:04] incredible things amen hallelujah so
[1:39:06] there they were
[1:39:08] woman of the well man on the cross but
[1:39:12] yet God said I see my seed in them
[1:39:14] they've got to come they were up to here
[1:39:15] in darkness but it doesn't matter how
[1:39:17] deep we are if there's life God will
[1:39:20] bring it out amen hallelujah so here we
[1:39:22] are in this age the devil's spent all
[1:39:25] this time brother Bram calls it this is
[1:39:27] Satan's Eden this is his paradise that
[1:39:29] he's made amen but now if you think now
[1:39:32] this is such a paradox where the devil
[1:39:34] has made this Eden but yet God can reach
[1:39:37] through all of his Darkness get a hold
[1:39:39] of you and I it doesn't matter how deep
[1:39:41] we are in it amen pull us out and then
[1:39:44] we become a living Paradox but yet we
[1:39:46] are not taken out of his Eve and we're
[1:39:48] still living in the Eden so we're still
[1:39:50] walking in this world it's getting worse
[1:39:52] and worse but this but God has done such
[1:39:54] a work in our hearts there's nothing in
[1:39:55] us that wants it we're not caught up in
[1:39:57] the politics we're not caught up in the
[1:39:59] Civil troubles we're not caught up in
[1:40:01] the economics of the world whatever's
[1:40:03] going whatever's trending in the news
[1:40:05] actually there's nothing else we just
[1:40:06] say well I read that the other day in
[1:40:07] the Book of Revelation amen let's move
[1:40:09] on praise God we're on time lord lord
[1:40:11] you're on time you're under budget
[1:40:12] you're on schedule praise God see that's
[1:40:14] how we should be right we shouldn't be
[1:40:16] consumed by it right amen so there's
[1:40:18] something now God does such a paradox in
[1:40:20] our lives that we are not caught up in
[1:40:22] this world anymore and the devil tries
[1:40:24] to bring out greater things
[1:40:26] flash your things surely this will get
[1:40:29] them nope he'll try this doesn't work he
[1:40:32] tries this doesn't work Hallelujah
[1:40:34] what's that now it's because you're a
[1:40:36] paradox it's unreasonable to him it's
[1:40:39] unreasonable to this world but it's
[1:40:41] incredible but yet it's true
[1:40:44] Hallelujah
[1:40:46] so we are now a people
[1:40:49] being a living Paradox upon the Earth
[1:40:51] I'm just finishing with that see
[1:40:53] sometimes we think well God's not doing
[1:40:55] anything for me I say he kept you
[1:40:57] another week and Satan's Eden
[1:40:59] he kept you another week in Satan's Eden
[1:41:01] you're still walking Victorious right
[1:41:03] you still said thank you Jesus for the
[1:41:05] blood applied thank you Lord I'm safe
[1:41:07] thank you Lord you fill me with your
[1:41:08] spirit thank you Lord I'm still a
[1:41:10] believer in spite of everything the
[1:41:11] devil see see a man man or woman can
[1:41:14] live so close to God that even the devil
[1:41:16] doesn't know what to do with them
[1:41:18] he'll send sickness he'll send trouble
[1:41:21] he'll send misunderstandings hardship
[1:41:23] pain he'll try and resurrect your past
[1:41:25] and make that drag you back he'll bring
[1:41:27] everything
[1:41:28] but then the devil get to a place where
[1:41:31] he says I have run out of things in my
[1:41:32] inventory I tried it all and it just
[1:41:35] won't work you look at brother Ron
[1:41:36] Spencer
[1:41:37] he's falling off a ceiling a roof 40
[1:41:40] feet under concrete broke every
[1:41:41] vertebrae in his back doctor said he'd
[1:41:43] never walk again he's walking
[1:41:45] right he was burned up in a propane fire
[1:41:47] 80 something percent of his lungs
[1:41:49] destroyed but then he was in a meeting
[1:41:51] where where um where there's preaching
[1:41:53] and and someone was preaching about
[1:41:55] chaos coming out of all I mean order
[1:41:56] coming out of chaos and he stood up said
[1:41:58] this is my moment and then he said he
[1:42:00] felt like his column of air come up come
[1:42:02] over him and he's got brand new lungs
[1:42:04] and he's and he's had Strokes he's had
[1:42:06] snake bites he's been struck by
[1:42:08] lightning twice all these different
[1:42:09] things now he's got stage four cancer
[1:42:11] over three years ago the doctor said
[1:42:13] you're gonna die are you still alive
[1:42:14] he's still preaching
[1:42:16] he's a living paradox
[1:42:18] amen and if God can get a hold of him
[1:42:21] and the devil can try every trick in the
[1:42:23] book against him but yet he's still
[1:42:25] standing loving the Lord how about you
[1:42:27] and I
[1:42:29] Hallelujah his life is a paradox you say
[1:42:31] well I haven't been through all those
[1:42:32] things but yeah are you still a Believer
[1:42:34] this morning do you love him with all
[1:42:35] your heart you just want more of him
[1:42:37] you're looking for his return every day
[1:42:39] say thank you Lord Jesus there's another
[1:42:41] day gone I'm a day closer to you taking
[1:42:43] me home thank you Lord Jesus another day
[1:42:45] God I'm closer to every promise amen
[1:42:47] thank you Lord hallelujah that I am the
[1:42:50] promise is on its way
[1:42:52] you're a paradox you're a paradox so
[1:42:55] that the world can't work you out it
[1:42:57] does you don't fit in their boxes
[1:42:59] Hallelujah but you fit in God's great
[1:43:01] plan
[1:43:02] amen so if you stand on his word God
[1:43:05] will produce another parity amen amen if
[1:43:08] we can just be like your bones in the
[1:43:09] hands of God God will do another Paradox
[1:43:11] what is that just be fully surrendered
[1:43:13] love him and God will be God will make
[1:43:16] you a living Paradox in a greater way
[1:43:18] hey man let's have the musicians this
[1:43:19] morning
[1:43:22] praise the Lord
[1:43:25] amen
[1:43:30] hello paradoxes how are you
[1:43:32] see the devil yo he'll tell you oh no
[1:43:35] there's nothing to this is just religion
[1:43:37] and you know going to church is just
[1:43:39] well that no we're paradoxes
[1:43:42] we are manifestations of God's Great
[1:43:44] Saving Grace
[1:43:46] amen so let's stand this morning
[1:43:49] and let's sing uh Miracle working God
[1:43:52] I like it
[1:43:53] this is the son of God's response to the
[1:43:55] devil
