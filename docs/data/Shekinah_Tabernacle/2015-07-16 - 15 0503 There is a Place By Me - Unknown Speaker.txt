[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everybody Welcome to the house of the Lord amen it's good to be here it's good to um like I always say it's good good to be in an atmosphere an environment where the spirit of God can um feel welcome no doubt you know many of us have different environments during the week that um unfortunately the spirit of God isn't welcome there so it's it's sometimes you get caught in the hustle and bustle and it's hard to you know just be sensitive and hear from the Lord but it's nice to be in a place like this where we can hear from the Lord be refreshed and like always encouraged we want to U make the most of it that we can lay hold on the opportunity that we have to to to let God speak to us and to to be in the place where we can grow a we bit more you know often think if God's the great Creator and uh what we call the Potter then the best thing that we can do with our lives is let him work on us and unfortunately when we're doing a lot of things and hustle and bustle he can't really work on us it's when we get in the still quiet times and God can speak to us that he can change our lives just why he he may speak to us about something that we're doing or something that we we're like or any way that he might do it to actually help us and when we when when he speaks to us and he he tells us a small thing that may just be a little piece of the puzzle in our life that make us a wee bit better and and we can get that in our quiet time in prayer we can get that in church here we can get that when we when we put effort into letting him deal with us so um I believe we're going to have a good time this morning and God is going to meet us and let's start I've got um number 259 lift up your heads are your Gates just like Old [Music] [Music]

get to that River to to be buried across Lord we know that you're the only one that can take us across Lord that that great Chasm between life and death so Lord I pray you'd open up opportunity there

thank you musicians thank you very much amen um is everyone comfortable it's not too hot is everyone all right turn um can we more juice give it less juice okay amen um if you got your Bibles handy if you wouldd like to stand with me and we'll just read a couple of scriptures um I want to read from numbers and then we'll go to the uh so Numbers chapter 27 and we'll read the first uh eight verses and then also we want to go to Exodus chapter 33 amen yes so numbers 27 and verse one um I'd like to speak uh I'd like to speak this morning about uh there is a place by me there's a place by me and we'll get that from uh a scripture in Exodus 33 but I want to read this here from numbers 27 as well so it says here from verse one it says then came the daughters of zelop fed the son of of hea the son of Gilead the son of of of uh Mech the son of Manasseh families of Manasseh the son of Joseph these are the names of his daughters Mara Noah hogla uh milka and and uh Tia and they stood before Moses and before alaza the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora but he died in his own sin and had no Sons why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he had no son give us therefore a possession among the Brethren of our father and Moses brought their cause before the Lord and the Lord spake unto Moses saying the daughters of zelop had speak right Thou shalt surely give them a possession for for an inheritance among their father's Brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel saying if a man die and have no son then you shall cause his inheritance to pass under his daughter and then uh we'll go to Exodus chapter 33 now that may seem well we'll just read this and then we'll um that may seem an unusual reading but I want to take something uh from it and um so Exodus chapter 33 and we'll read from verse 13 I trust this is your heart's desire so this is Moses speaking to God maybe we'll read from verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou saith unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me thy way that I may Know Thee that I may par me find Gra in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not from hence for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and he said beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I'll make all my goodness pass before thee and I'll procla proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou canest not see my face for thou for shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand Upon A Rock Amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated amen so I really want to take a uh yeah so my subject I want to talk about is there is a place by me now it may seem like the two texts that we read don't really go together but I want to show that our POS but but our possession and our position or place is actually one and the same now a possession is something seized or it's um you know something that you actually have it's a possession something that belongs to you and these these um five these five daughters here um I would I would like to uh call them like the wise the wise virgin from Matthew 25 who had oil in their lamps because they wanted because the the children of God so not the not the foolish like the foolish virgin but the wise ones they want what God has for them they want to actually possess what God has actually given them and and these daughters even though it wasn't written in in the at that time they knew that part of the land actually rightfully belonged to them because it would have belonged to their fathers so they actually made a as we read they they came before Moses and before Alazar and they said give us a possession and they they were granted a possession in the promised land and in the promised land it's very important because the promised land was the only place of the Resurrection there was no Resurrection in Egypt there's no Resurrection somewhere else but it was in the promised land there was the resurrection that's why Jacob you know you know he was buried there Joseph said concerning his bones don't leave me down in Egypt bury me in the promised land they were prophets they were spiritual they knew that there was the resurrection was going to be in the promised land they knew where Abraham bought the piece of ground and buried Sarah you know in that area was going to be the resurrection and that's why they were they were buried there and so the spiritual among Israel knew that that land was more than just a land flowing with milk and honey but they knew the resurrection would take place in that land so to have a possession in that land was every it was more than having nice Vineyards having more than having a nice house or having a nice family life but if they knew if they if they entered into their possession that God had given them they would come up in the Resurrection The True Believer would so to be in that in that possession that's why I believe those five daughters they went to Moses say give us a possession in this land because they knew that part of it belonged to them and the and the promised land for us we know is the Holy Ghost it is not a piece of land but it is actually our position in Christ and if we can trly see that our rest is in him the resurrection hey the resurrection is not knowing the Bible only the resurrection isn't just knowing quotes the resurrection isn't just coming to church but the resurrection is to know him to know him is to have life and if you don't know him you have nothing you failed miserably but to have him is to have everything and so it takes God to make the word live because when he when he quickens the word to your heart that is him speaking to you that is him actually revealing himself to you and he's doing it for a purpose because he is a place by him I have a place by me and that place must be full and he has his intent is to take you from from your place and I'll show you it's it's a place is more than just a you know it's more than just well I live in this place I go to this place for work but the definition of this word place it means so it means so it means um properly a standing that is a spot so it's wisely used as a locality but also figuratively it is a condition of body or mind so it's a that's a condition so when when Paul says that we have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son he's speaking to people upon the Earth he's saying you've actually been moved because that word translation is to move from one place to another so it's not to like translate words but it's actually I've been translated I've been moved so so the believer who's truly met God and God has transformed their life and all they want to do is serve him and serve his you know serve him with everything that's in him you know there's a life and it's not them doing it they know it's not them but God is in them and God is living the Christian Life out of them I say those people have been translated Hallelujah if if you have met him I tell you you are not in the Kingdom of this world anymore but you've been translated from this Kingdom of this world into the kingdom of God you've been moved to a different place you've been moved to a different condition entirely different condition that's why the believer is a hey we can't help being different we can't helping different you know it's not a bunch of rules and regulations do this don't do this hey the spirit of God in a Believer makes him totally a different person doesn't matter what skin color where they're from age that's irrelevant but the spiritual condition of someone that's truly been born again more than just anointed by the spirit but God comes and dwells in them that condition that person hate they can't help being different because if there's a life in you that that that just just something in you says I can't do that anymore I just don't like that anymore but now I love these things and people look at you say you've gone mad well actually no you haven't G mad you found your mind you have the mind of Christ you we come to your senses Hallelujah so now we have been we have been moved to a different place Hallelujah we've been changed we've been moved there's a place by him so they wanted their position be um uh their position because they knew the the resurrection was in that land now we are in a season now where God is causing everyone to come to their place amen everyone this is this is a manifestation time this is a harvest time and God has causing doesn't matter evil Good Wicked righteous whatever whatever the cuz God knows the end from the beginning now we know we have free moral agency but he knows who's going to be there and who's not going to be there ultimately but he actually gives you the choice you look through the Bible you look through the Bible and and even prophets have been given Visions but it's up to the people to fulfill that Vision you take the prophet that goes to the king I think it's Elisha he you know you read in Second Kings there he's he he's uh got the sickness that he's going to die with and then he and then either the king visits him or or he's going to get visited by the king and then and then this Prophet says fire an arrow out of the window he says it's the it's the arrow of the Deliverance of the Lord and then and then take the arrows and smite the ground and the King only smites the ground three times and this Prophet was mad he says why don't you smite it more than three cuz you but now you'll only beat the enemy three times so the prophet saw it in a vision the potential of what could have happened yeah it was up for the people in that who were actually in the vision to live it out accordingly y so now it's the same thing God actually gives us free moral choice are we going to go free or we going to stay bound because now if there is a if we are called to actually take our position hey if God if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you always were the Bride of Jesus Christ if you are meant to be a be in a place next to him a place by me God ordained you to stand in that place it's only by his grace we could ever stand with him and so but if but if that is the case then that means that the devil has to let go chains have to be broken unbelief has to be driven out Satan has to be cast out of out of every heart of the bride and God has to take up residence so there has to be a loosing now there has to be a release of God's people and we are living in that time of release we are living in that time of Jubilee where everyone that that is ordained and wants to go free shall Go free and everyone that is bound shall not stay bound and I want to read this here from Leviticus 25 we'll just let's just read this because this is all part of us going to another place being being changed from the kingdom of this world to the kingdom of our God now we go to Leviticus 25 we are at the end of all things everything must come to its position everything must come to its maturity everything good and bad you know the devil you know his his work is coming to its maturity and so God's work is coming to its maturity so now if we read from verse 9 now it says then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall they make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall Hall the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and um sorry and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall be that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself in it neither GA neither gather the grapes in it of thy wine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man under his possession so it now so here comes a season now just in the Old Testament type that here comes a season now where every slave every Bond man every Bond woman must return to what belongs to them and we understand to be redeemed as you are redeemed back to your original estate you're actually taken back to where you should have been in the first place so so if you have been redeemed God is actually because when you're born you're not in the condition you're meant to be in but in you was a life that was going to come forth and we're not talking about your natural life we're talking about God God's eternal life and so but there came a season now where God Came Upon your sin and God spoke to your heart and you begin to recognized I'm more than just a person living upon this Earth I'm more than a dad or a wife or a husband or you know or a mom or whatever it was but I'm a child of God and so and God what he's doing now is he's actually saying now I've set you at Liberty and he begins to enforce now upon the believer their rights that they are free that the devil must let go of all of God's children and that everything that the devil tries to hold against you must stricken off that is a Year of Jubilee because when a slave became a slave he had all this debt he said I got to sell myself into slavery because I have this debt and I cannot pay it and we had a debt we could not owe we had a debt we could not pay we needed someone to take all of our sin away we needed someone to actually to actually set us free Hallelujah and that's exactly that's why we just sung the song because Jesus came God came down cuz he knew know no man could pay the debt didn't matter how sincere they were didn't matter how much they read the Bible didn't matter how much they prayed or they went to the temple and they offered sacrifices hey they still packed a sin debt amen they were still actually slaves to that first nature to that sin nature but then Jesus came and he broke those chains and now he has come to tell you today this morning you don't have to yield yourself to sin nature anymore you don't have to yield yourself to unbelief but you can walk in Liberty this morning that you you you can walk in the way God has already intended you to be you just have to let him do it hey they heard the trumpet they could say well my Master's pretty nice he's been good to me this year maybe I'll stay with him you know the outside world's scary I don't really know where my possession is I got a lot of work to do I've got to you know rebuild the walls I've got to rearrange my possession you know my Master's good to me that's how the devil likes to paint the picture to you he said it's really not that bad I'm a good person I haven't killed anyone haven't raped anyone haven't murdered any you know I haven't done anything too bad in society I'm a good person and that's the devil trying to paint a picture just stay with me everything's fine with me amen hey he's a liar don't live below your privilege hallelujah amen don't be a slave to anything anymore Hallelujah just let it go he say I can't overcome this thing you're not meant to overcome it let him overcome it you got to yield yourself and say I'm the clay hey do we have a bunch of clay here are you the clay who's the Potter you're not the Potter he's the Potter he said when you say Potter mold me shape me and be willing to him to just rearrange your life because if you yield to him he'll do it if you don't yield he won't do it he's a gentleman that's right but he wants you to be free today because we are in a time where everything's coming to its position everything's coming to its maturity and so the Bride of Jesus Christ must come to her position she must come to a place by him amen he he she must be elevated now from from the sin of this world and just being a church member who knows a bunch of Doctrine to a living where God comes and lives in her and the Very life that was in him is now in her and he has preeminence over her and she does everything that pleases him amen we're in that season friends of adoption of the placing of the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the season we're living in yes sir and adoption in the Bible if you read the book of Galatians he uh Paul speaks about adop op and it's not like Western world where we think we go to China we go to Russia we we go down the street there's some awful child who is not born into our family and then we bring it into the family that's not adoption in the Bible speak Bible language is the adoption is the placing of a son the placing of a child so there's a child that is Born Into the family and then there comes a season in its life where the the father is pleased and then now the father places that child and says everything they say everything they do as good as me doing it that is adoption and we're in that season of adoption friends we're in that season where God is taking a people and he is placing her because he's pleased in her Hallelujah he is pleased in what she does he is pleased in how she lives he is pleased in everything hey he says devil look at this woman behold this woman upon the Earth there's none like her in all all the Earth there's been none like us since Adam and Eve before the fall amen that's right amen there's been none like her look at her isn't she perfect and in God's eyes hey you're perfect hey I'm talking about sinless perfection the Bride of Jesus Christ put your name there is as holy and is as righteous as God is holy and righteous that's right amen am he became me that I might become him by works no by Grace amen but you have to be willing yes amen you see in the scripture you you you read in the Old Testament they told to do certain things you take you take um um you take the Book of Judges you know you take uh Gideon obedience led to the Supernatural coming upon the scene the angel visited him and the angel said you know uh you God said you know you know gives him an offering and then Gideon his eyes come up and he recognizes this was actually God speaking to him he says he down the altar in your father's house take the Bullocks and make it into a sacrifice so he had to be obedient in those things and then God Came Upon the scene even more yes am you see it all through the Old Testament Moses Moses you know to build the Tabernacle he had to build the Tabernacle according to how he saw it God showed him a vision this is how it is this is the dimensions this is how it's all meant to be all the way down to the priests uh garments and all these things and when he did that God came down and dwelt in that Tabernacle God actually allowed man to build him a house Solomon the same thing he so so they are obedient to the to what God put upon their hearts and they did what God Said and God came down and lived through that amen see obedience always leads to the supernatural God living that's right Hallelujah but it all begins where God says do this and you do this then God comes down amen hey you see it you just go through all the Old Testament Hallelujah and we want God to live that hey that's my one's heart's desire every day especially when we come here or Wednesday whenever we gather Lord I want to see you live I want to see your glory I'm not satisfied with just having a service and off we go and all these I want to see God do what he wants to do that's what I want to see amen you say well we've had some good meetings hey let's not get satisfied with just having good meetings I want to see them face to face Hallelujah I want to see him as he is you want to see him as he is hallelujah that's what I want to see amen you say well you ask too much hey you try and ask him too much go try him try God one time lord I want to see you look do you think he's just going to hold it back hey that's his he's been waiting for you to be born upon the he been waiting thousands of years hey sure he's an eternal being but he's watching his great plan what he thought in his mind now is manifesting upon the Earth this was in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and then finally his time has gone he's allotted his word he said the law and he told told Noah to build the ark then he sent the law then the prophets came and then John the Baptist came these were all in his thoughts then finally he came upon the Earth himself as was prophesied hallelujah amen then then he paid redemption's price and then and then Peter James and John the apostles They Came Upon the earth and the book of Acts was lived hey that was all in God's mind you think he would you know hey you have a child and they grow and you begin to interact with them more or hey you just it just Thrills your heart amen you know they're coming there nine months they're on their way amen so so but then finally here they are and to talk to them and they talk back to you and it gets better every day how much more when God must see finally they're here hallelujah finally brother hes here amen hallelujah finally you know you're all here amen hey a thrill his heart amen amen and then finally now you manifested upon the Earth and so we're here now I don't know how I got onto that but you know this is what God has been waiting for so when we say Lord I want you to live hey he's I've been waiting for you to ask me to come cuz he always comes where he's invited amen amen hallelujah so now we're in a Year of Jubilee now Joshua Joshua you know if we go let's go to Joshua chapter 5 I just want to lay some things out there maybe we'll go to the book of Ephesians but um so now we come to a season where Moses had a desire Show Me Your Glory it says there's a place by me and I'll set you upon a rock and but then God's work still had to unfold more and someone had to take them into the land and here comes Joshua no doubt Joshua would have had a great burden because he seen God work mly through Moses and and and he knew all moses' testimonies and he knew what it was like to go through the Red Sea and he knew what it was like to see the death angel you know that night where they put the blood on the door and the ltil and hearing the screams of the Egyptians but maybe the rejoicing of the children of Israel he knew what that was all like but now it was his time it was his time to take up the word for himself and make it live this was his burden now because you know we can all Rejoice oh brother Braham did this and this person did this and this Old Saint did this and what a wonderful testimony of this person but then when it comes into your lamp and now it's your season to live this out hey this would have been his burden because he could have said you know being there with Moses he would have said of course yeah Moses we're going to take the land God's given us the land but then now it falls on his lap and now it's his responsibility to live out his portion of the word but I want you to see here now in Jo uh this is in Joshua chapter 5 we read from verse 13 down to 15 and it came to pass see see so they're at Jericho they don't have any Siege equipment physically it's impossible for them to take the city physically yes and so now you know he's thinking how am I going to do this God's given us the land now how's it going to be lived out if you can just you know if it just sinks into your heart God's given me all things there's there's not every devil must be under my feet amen amen everything that the devil tries to put against me must be under my feet in subjection to me so so I trust you believe that with all your heart but now you say how's this going to live out amen amen because we have to take our Promised Land as well and so here in Joshua 5 it says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against them with a sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as the captain of the Lord's host I uh am I now come and Joshua fell on his face on to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy foot a shoe off thy foot for the place on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so so now here comes so so he's the leader of Israel this great burden he's got to place the people in in their land but then God comes upon the scene as the captain of the Lord host and he tells Joshua you know I'm not for you I'm not against you I'm here to take over this battle I'm here to come and place the people in the land that's what he's telling I'm I'm I'm actually taking your leadership and I'm putting you under my leadership and I'm going to lead you into the promised land and when God comes upon the scene like this it's when people come into their possession because he was the angel of the Lord came down to Moses and he said there is a place in the promised land that these people must go to and so now their inheritance they were about to receive their inheritance and those people those churches in the land those denominations in the land those Philistines and all the people in the promised land they thought it belonged to them and they laid claim to it they could have gone back hundreds of years and say our forbear he built this city and then he built this city and he made this nation and this is why we're here but then but in God's eyes they had no right they had no right to the promised land they had no real claim hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I the devil might say it doesn't belong to you the days of Miracles has passed God doesn't live in that way anymore and you just tell them you're a liar amen you tell them you tell them exactly you say that's a lie my God said he be with me even in me to the end of the world and the things that I do you shall do also and greater than this shall you do because I go to my father amen so he has no right the devil can try and say this belong this because hey this Earth You Know Why the world is in chaos do you know why the world's in chaos because the the kingdom of God is being established in the hearts of the Bride of Jesus Christ and two kingdoms cannot be here at the same time and so now a a you know brother Braham he he he takes a word I can't remember where from uh like the kingdom of God it's actually the Messianic Empire it's in the scripture so I say now the Messianic Empire the kingdom of God is being established so now the kingdom of Satan is shaking amen the kingdom of of Satan is falling apart Because of You amen amen cuz the bride is coming to her position two empires cannot be here at the same time two Willers cannot stand at the same time because those two national Spirits are fighting for dominance and it's the same thing in the you know in the religious realm where the the spirit of God in his bride is fighting for dominance against the spirit of Satan and his Antichrist religions and his kingdom Must Fall because it's prophesied it shall fall and the Bride of Jesus Christ must Ascend to her position because it's prophesied you shall Ascend you shall be placed in the place that God has ordained you to be Hallelujah that's where you know God is ordained he says there's a place by me and you know what husband here or wife would not want their spouse by them amen come here honey stand next to me cuz I'm proud of you I want you to be next near me I want to show you off hallelujah amen what do you think God wants to do he want to say look at this woman amen that I have loved with a Everlasting Love that I have redeemed Hallelujah that I may join ears with me amen look at her hey Hallelujah so he is determined there is a place by him and he's determined you shall stand in that place and we'll come to it in Revelations amen so we have called now the devil's kingdom is falling because he is falling and the reason is because you're ascending hey every every you can look back in your life and things that used to bother you after you're saved now but things that used to bother you complexes traits in your life that you're not proud of now now when they used to rule you you rule them Hallelujah things that used to bother you in your personality or things pass down from generation to generation finally God comes and breaks that cycle and you defeat that devil hallelujah amen she can and what is that you're taking your Promised Land you're taking your inheritance amen and you're ascending that's you ascending because you're putting these things these things are put under your feet and they don't rule you anymore but you rule them and the thing that rules is always on top hallelujah amen so we're ascending that's why I say the bride is ascending to her rightful position now if we go ahead to Revelations chapter 3 we'll read a couple of scriptures here at the end of the um end of the chapter and we'll read here from uh verse 21 and 22 now remember that this is this is God speaking to the last Church age and we are living in that church age amen uh all the blessings that God says to him that overcometh because he says to every age to him that overcometh I'll Grant this I'll give you this and all those blessings are added down Through the Ages but this is our um so all the other all of the Bride through all the ages will sit with him as we are granted but you see now he's saying now he's saying there is a place where you shall be he's saying to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne now Throne is a place even as I overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so he say to him that overcometh there is a place by me and you shall sit in that place that's what he's saying I'm saying there is a there is a prepared place for you you now because we you know we read here and maybe we just go to Isaiah 66 I just want to read um just a few more scriptures here we have here in Isaiah 66 God says this now cuz remember so this is the heart of God so it's not it's not the heart of man being revealed this is the heart of God and he says here in Isaiah 66 and verse1 it says thus sayith the Lord says what saying he is determined because it's a harvest time he has determined now that you'll be free of everything and you'll come to your rightful place amen amen you see when when the angel of the Lord was there with Joshua with Moses he was determined now that the people in the land would be dispossessed and the children of Israel would take their rightful inheritance and it caused everyone to come in their rightful position he did and so is the same thing today we have the angel of the Lord has appeared to us God has come down and now he has determined where will take our inheritance this is a time where the bride receives everything that belongs to her amen they says in Isaiah 66 and verse one thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest and we see where um I think Stephan picks us up he says how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest and Paul picks it up and says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost uh which is in you which you have of God and you're not of your own so God is actually saying where is the place of my rest he's saying where are my children where where is my bride that I can find a resting place in her soul that's what he's saying Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol but where is the place of my rest where's my family where's my loved ones where's my dear ones that I want to gather to me that's what he's throwing that's what he's asking that's his great burden I made the heavens and the earth I made all things but where is the place of my rest where is my elected lady Hallelujah where's the one I can dwell in and and God can actually put skin on him once again he hey he takes your body and God has veiled in flesh amen amen hey that that's that's not too big to chew hey if God dwells in you God has put on flesh once again the word has been made flesh once again amen amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ the word has been made flesh hallelujah amen that's right brother Peter says that you are you you're Lively Stones living stones made into the temple of God am Hallelujah and the reason you're living is because God lives in you and God has placed us together in our place amen hallelujah we are the Temple of the Living God by one Spirit we're baptized into one body that's what the scripture tells us so he's saying where is the place of my rest and you can say here I am yes Here I Am Lord you've been looking for me here I am hallelujah hallelujah sir but he wants to take you and place you as that appropriate Place amen as the place of his rest that's why he found you that's why he's called you that's why he's gathered you because there's a place by him and he's determined you shall be in that place now we read here in Revelations let's go to Revelations chapter 12 Hallelujah you are the place of his rest you have been prepared you have been prepared to be a place of his rest now we're going to Revelations chap 12 cuz I said now there's a war now there is a war between Satan and and God and the war is now who does this land this Earth and you're part of this Earth who does this whole world system belong to this is it's always been a great great struggle between him and God Satan Satan thinks that he he owns it because Adam forfeited it but it couldn't go into his his hands even though he has a bit of control because he can that's why there's the typhoons that's why there's the earthquakes that's why there's all the sickness and the plagues and all these things because because he because the devil is actually in control of this earth right now right that's why it is because man let him take control right so we just reaping what Adam swed back in the garden why does God allow suffering because he actually he actually has permissively allowed Satan to take control of this Earth because Adam forfeited godship over this Earth but then we know this must come to an end this must come to an end you know it's so late I don't know if you feel a change in the season but but the hour is late Hallelujah and I say praise God the hour is late I want it to be late amen I want it to be done yeah how much you think God when he says it is done in the in the end of the book of Revelation hey he's going to be he's going to rejoice actually becomes becomes material when it's more than just thinking in his mind or just scripture on a page but this when that day that scripture was fulfilled he says it's done and we say hallelujah come quickly Lord oh don't you want to go to heaven Hallelujah don't you want to see our enemy cast into the Lake of Fire don't you want to see sickness and everything that Wars against you done away with hallelujah amen hey I want to see that day hallelujah oh whyn't you be sad that day no sir hallelujah amen Revelations 12: 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven so they're changing place and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives until the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time there was a time where the devil could go up into heaven and accuse accuse you before the judge cuz he knows God is Judge that's why he he went up there in the days of job you know cuz he was trying to get something he could hold against job and he knows our life story he's a very good genealogist you know he knows the you know the weaknesses of our family of our of our Humanity that has passed down and he knows our weaknesses and he tells God he says those people are are worthy to be destroyed hey God is a righteous judge he's not a little oding granddad but he's a judge and says when the Wrath of the Lamb is poured out upon the Earth in the Great Tribulation it'll be a great wrath it'll be a terrible time for the Earth but it'll be glorious for the Believers because we'll be up in glory then but you see now there there has to come a time where Satan is not in heaven anymore where he actually has no legal right to come up and accuse us before God day and night and that he is cast down and we understand that we're living in that time hey great things are great things are happening amen in the season that we're alive and you know the whole world order not just in the scene but has been has been totally rearranged yes sir where Satan is being dispossessed and the Bride of Jesus Christ is coming into her possession where brother BR speaks about when the lamb took the book and he and he loosed the seals he said that that book is is is the book of redemption it is a titled deed to the Earth that Adam forfeited went back into the hands of the original owner but he says now comes the season where the lamb steps forth because because he he paid that that piece of paperwork would be handed back into man's hands once again godship over the Earth that's what it means it's godship over the Earth because God knew that no man was worthy you know when you when John is lifted up in Revelations 4 and 5 and the strong Angel proclaims who is worthy to take the book and John WEP because there's no man there found worthy hey there were Mighty Prophets You Know Abram was there Mighty prophets were there Moses was there Elijah was there brother was there Paul was there you know mighty men and women of God were all there but no man was found worthy hey there were Angels there they but but God didn't die for Angels amen and that's why John Whi because he knew if if no one was no man no Flesh and Blood like us was found worthy to take that book all of creation was was lost and the enemy couldn't be dethroned but then he saw the he he he turned to look he saw the lamb come forth he saw Jesus come forth because he had had overcome he had prevailed and he had been found worthy and he took that deed out of the hands of God now it's all remember it's all symbolic and so he takes the ownership the paperwork to the to to this earth he takes it for himself am but then he doesn't leave it for himself because he did all that for you that you would come to his position hey he was the son of God he didn't have to be redeemed he didn't need to be saved or anything he was in his rightful position from his birth onwards he just grew into that position but then we we have to be taken from this world we have to be set free from everything and the devil is holding you back just just just let go amen if the devil's trying to hold you back just say I don't serve you no longer Hallelujah hey tell it to his face I don't serve you anymore Hallelujah this habit I don't serve you anymore this addiction I don't serve you anymore I'm done with you yes hallelujah amen amen hey if you confess it God will work upon your confession he is the high priest of our profession hallelujah hallelujah amen so now he takes that book and he doesn't what he does is he doesn't leave it in his own possession but now he passes it down to you by the preaching of the word in this hour that's why this message is so important because it causes you to recognize who you are in Christ and what Christ has done for you and is actually an overcoming power in this word hey Joshua heard the preaching of Moses him and Caleb and there was an overcoming power in that preaching that they say more than able to take the land and they took what belonged to them how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of the perfect one Hallelujah when we hear that word we say it belongs everything belongs to me this Earth belongs to me amen the devil is defeated he has no right to to come into my life any longer he's no right to come around my children to come around my spouse to to try and hold me back in anyway he has no right and you have the right by speaking the word and faith take God at his word speak it across the lips and wait for it to become manifested amen hallelujah that's what Abraham did he said I believe you I believe that and he confessed it Sarah we're having the promised son and he just rejoiced Hallelujah 25 years you're still rejoicing Hallelujah and then one day one day in God season here we are here's the here's Isaac hallelujah amen hey we're in that same boat friends that's right amen we're waiting for the return of the promised son for the promised son hey we're prepared we've been changed to to meet the promised son that's why Abraham and Sarah they go down to Egypt Abraham says to Sarah tell him you're my sister Here Comes Grandma why is he afraid if it's old grandma that's still old then the king the king who could have taken any woman he wanted in that whole land he says I want I want this one old grandma no teeth bunched over gray here all no she was turned back young again to receive the promise she had a body chain HJ hallelujah amen to receive the promised son and we have in us already that power that can change this body Hallelujah if you have the Holy Ghost you have already everything we have need of is in you already amen it just takes the preaching of the word to say hey that is mine and that is mine too and it's already in me and I can use it I mean I have faith to to push the button Hallelujah to activate God and God comes upon the scene for you amen we have right and so this is why the the world's falling apart because Satan is being dispossessed and there's a people rising up who recognize who they are and Satan is being dispossessed and we're actually ascending into our rightful position yes sir Hallelujah I believe it now let's go to uh the book of Ephesians and we'll go to Ephesians chapter 2 amen have you see God molding and shaping your character to match his character you're taking your land amen amen you see more more of Christ in you in your behavior how you relate to people all these things because remember you hear the word and the word is meant to create Christ's character in you that's what Revelation does produces his life in you yes that's why Moses he received the law by Revelation upon Mount Si and he was he became the meekest man in all the Earth why because it was a revelation to him and produced that character before that he was a general he was ruled here in Egypt he wasn't some little Meek guy going to ride in his Chariot come on boys we're going to kill these Ethiopians or whatever they were hey he wouldn't have been a meink little fellow sitting in the back he have jumped on his Chariot gone headlong into the enemy amen but then because God revealed himself to him and produced this meekness in them amen oh I know the Bible what character do you have oh I believe God what character do you have amen amen oh the message all makes sense to me what character do you have what does it produ amen cuz if it's just window dressing get rid of the window dressing get the life amen hey that's why the scribes and Pharisees they learned the same law arrogant people look at me look at my coat look how clean I am I do all this and I look at me and this is what it means and all this stuff brother Bram said this he did this and look at the character amen were they Meek were they Lonely No look what it did to Paul look at the character he had look at the he lived right Timothy when you come bring my coat it's cold amen I come to you in great weakness and great trembling right Le you trust in man's Wisdom right why is that because it was Christ's character in the man now hey before that he said I'm Dr Saul and open your Bible and this is what this means in this scripture and I'll tell you what this means and I'll recite the book of Isaiah to you backwards and forwards and up and down all these things look how great I am in my learning but when God came all that was done away and he could say a prisoner of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he became a loved prisoner to Jesus Christ and that was reflected in his life yes Hallelujah that's why we can say if God is molding his character into you you're ascending you're taking your Promised Land because we've been called to be molded and shaped into his image and that's not wearing a robe and walking around Galilee and doing all these things it's his very nature his very life in you amen hallelujah hallelujah now let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 J I read from verse one he saying you hath he quickened so he's speaking now these are people who who who really know God and you had the quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins when in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience so they had a jubilee once they were once they were following the spirit of this world and they did what the world said and they did what the this is my culture this is what I do yep that's how they used to be many of them would have been religious people you know worshiped Diana and all these different different denominations but then God Came Upon their scene he says you have the quickens so be made alive among whom verse three also ye all had our conversation in times past of the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved now notice now and he's saying and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see he's saying now he has taken you and he's placed you in your rightful position amen he it's not you know when we say oh we're sitting together in Heavenly places the believer is always in that position the believer is placed in a different position then than the unbeliever or the make believer because the believer now s walks in a realm of Faith the believer doesn't walk around in the realm of unbelief hey they may struggle and wrestle and all these things but when when when all that is put to one side and Faith takes a hold they're walking in a realm of faith amen amen every day we are walking in a realm of Faith amen how you conduct yourself during the day what you wear what you do what you don't do the things you talk about that is that is walking in a realm of Faith yeah amen amen hey why do you think different you know people talk about their you know I just watched a series of this TV show the other weekend there's people at work now that used to be me but what has happened where I say why would I do that yeah it's not cuz I'm busy I got three kids hey they would do the same thing if they had kids no doubt they just P them there say watch this you know but what isn't me saying why would I do that you know hey what has happened I've been moved I say I'm trust you can say you've been moved from that place into a different place you're you're living in a whole different realm yes amen amen that's right so now so he's saying this and this heavenly place in Christ Jesus is the position that the believer has in Christ yeah yes so this position we we have been placed in yeah so we've been raised now from Death unto life to sit together in Heavenly places so the bride you know the believer lives in this place all the time that's why brother Braham when when he was challenged with the maniac there he said I'm going to break every you know bone in your body and punch him out and all these things in front of thousands of people beforehand he was a trained boxer he so so he could turn that guy on but because he was now he was saved he was now walking in a different realm and so he was instead of fighting it in the physical he stayed back and then you Lord be still and the Lord will fight for you yeah so he stayed still and then in God's timing God Came Upon the scene and used his mouth and that big demon possessed guy fell at his feet amen y because he was walking in a different realm yes amen and it's the same thing hey that position brother Braham is in is where the believer is is too yes Y and that was done to show what God can do in a redeemed person amen amen to give an example of what Calvary can do in a person do to a person so it's giving us showing us now that we can walk in the same way hey you know brother Ram says I don't need a lot of faith cuz God chose me the vision and I just go do it it says you actually need more faith not to see a vision but just take God at his word amen that's right amen amen so you know he so so many times he waited for a vision and he acted upon the vision you know but we don't we're we we're not called to that hey sure if God in his grace wants to give you a vision or something he'll do it but a lot of the time we just got to take God into his word take it in faith and just do it amen or oh I feel to go pray for this one or speak to this one or do this you might never see anything really feel anything but s says go he say yes Lord here I am and you go do it Amen brother so it's walking in a different realm and so Satan now is cast down and we have been elevated to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen now I just want to read I want to read this this is a manifestation uh uh uh manifested sons of God in 1960 it's in the adoption series and Christ brought the church up to a place to where their position was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church at order the Joshua of today puts the church in its order giving each one gifts places position and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now do uh do you get that much of it see so the Holy Ghost places us in our position he he he places us in our place of adoption and it's either to be a businessman or a housewife or a mom or a dad or a or a work or a preacher or a song leader or a musician all those things hey a mom you know I tell you the most powerful thing after God I believe is a Godly woman amen I honestly believe that the most powerful thing upon this Earth after God is a Godly woman well how is that because brother says if you break Womanhood you've got the nation yeah he didn't say if you break manhood now men have to be men and Lead their homes absolutely but he didn't say if you break manhood he says if you break Womanhood if you break mother if you break mother you've broken the nation that's right amen so many times we think of being placed and adopted as some great big lofty thing you know go be a missionary here or go do this here or you know but no he says he says to be adopted as a housewife to be adopted as a so so that's your placing that God has placed you this is I've actually come to my adoption you know Paul says in I think in Ephesians 1 he says that he is having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so actually he's saying he's actually predestinated us to the placing in the kingdom and that's the highest calling that's the highest thing is for people to be placed in their inheritance rightfully you're following me yep so so a m that's actually being placed I'm called you say that's not a GL ous job I'm called God has ordained me he's adopted me placed me to be a m hey in God's eyes that's a mighty thing that's as mighty as King David taking the throne that's as mighty as Paul the Apostle Paul being placed as an apostle amen hey just say Amen if you're not really too sure about it it's true amen it's exactly true hey that's why that's why Timothy because Timothy said I see the gift that was in Lois you know Unice and and then your mom is in you why is that because a Godly M and a Godly grandma was an example and they in their position and they lived according to what God laid down for them to do and that affected Timothy's life so someone being placed in their adoption because they were sitting in Heavenly places what are you doing looking after the kids whatever I'm sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm adopted I've been placed what are you doing going to your job whatever I've been adopted this is what I'm called to be this is this is my inheritance that God has placed me to and if you've been placed and I trust you you know maybe you look at your life a bit different you say this is what I meant to be why do you have that feeling CU that's actually God saying this is what you're meant to be and in my eyes it's a mighty thing and if someone stands in their place God will back them up why didn't David have to deal with abson why not because King David he knew he was ordained to be king and he he took the full responsibility of being King he didn't leave the decision to someone else like Ahab did but he took full respons saying this is the kingship it's me you know and and he possessed that office that he was placed in or his adoption he he possessed it fully I'm King and then absolon raised up now I think partly it was the weakness of David's relationship with him that's why abson raised up but because David was standing as king God took care of abson that's right amen but it was also why did raised up like that well David I don't think had a very good relationship with his son and you can see that because what happened with when when when uh Samuel called Jesse saying bring your bring your sons we're going to have a feast now why wasn't David called why wasn't David called why wasn't David even brought into the equation or maybe Jesse didn't even have a good relationship with him so you got to bring it down to be bones you know why wasn't he called well because Jesse you know oh it's just David he's just doing his thing he's not really that important he's just looking after the Sheep you know and possibly that that poor relationship came down to the Next Generation with with David and absum and that's why these things happen but even with his failings like that because he possessed that office he knew he was adopted to be king placed as king whenever the enemy raised up against them that thing was taken care of yes amen now what was I going to finish on I think I'll just close but we see here we have been called to a place Jesus says in John 14 he says I go to prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and when that place is heaven we know it's our body that's already waiting for us our our Eternal Body but that place that place has been prepared just like Moses standing there on the Rock he wanted to see he wanted to see God's glory and that place was prepared for Moses no one else could do the job it's the same thing with you if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ no one can take your place amen amen no one can take your place God knows hey we have to have Security in whom we have believed doesn't mean we get lazy or loose you know but hey God Paul said I want to apprehend that which has apprehended me that's what he said and it's the same way as Moses saying Show Me Your Glory I really want to see you as you are he wanted to really lay hold of this thing this life that had got on hold of him even though he said Moses do I mean God do many great things he wanted to see his glory and I trust that that is the same with you you've been play there's a place next to him he's saying there's a place by me and he wants you to go stand in that place that condition yes amen and he wants you to go there what is well how do I get there just lay it all down lay it all down say Lord take my life rearrange it how you want me to be amen that's hey death to self You Must Die the Rich Young Ruler wasn't willing to die to his riches so he ended up in his place which was hell he looked up in Flames Lazarus the bigger went to his Place went to heaven Judas went to his place which was hell amen the other Thief I mean I mean you know one Thief also went there as well the other Thief saw the lamb saw Christ and that was his season that was his his uh his prepared moment and he went to his place amen cuz God wanted him there and he got there you have to be willing there's a place are you willing to stand in that place amen that's the question see it's not it's not if God is able as do you believe it because God has proved himself down through the centuries amen so much in our generation amen we could have a monthlong testimony meeting right here just just in this little room amen of what God has done even just the past year amen amen so it's not if he's able it's are you willing do you believe it amen hallelujah maybe we'll just let's just bow our head shall we I Wonder If there's you know if you want to just raise your hand if you want
