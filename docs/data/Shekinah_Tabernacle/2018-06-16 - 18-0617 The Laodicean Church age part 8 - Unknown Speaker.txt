amen where amen it's a wonderful so here's a strictly after service we're to go down to the river and we're gonna have a baptism amen if you've got your Bibles handy let's just go to Romans chapter 1 and we're gonna we're going to read from verse 19 and we're gonna read down to verse we're going to read unto the end of the chapter no it says see it's here because that which may be known of God is manifest in them I'll see if I can like I can manifest in them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like a corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and to creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one towards another even men with men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of the errors which was meet and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure and them that do them amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I know it's bit of a quite a heavy piece of Scripture I want to continue on about we're talking about the lady of C in church age and I was I was reading about your brother Brahim said though that the that the world will go totally insane and the world is falling apart you know when he preached the sermon the world again is falling apart you know it wasn't just a nice title he's declaring something and you can just go back if you study the last hundred years of history you see the world has fallen apart and it's just so alarming where well to me myself because you know I'm not I'm not well up in 80 or 90 years old so I have not seen the world fall apart in my lifetime I've been born in a time when the world already has fallen apart and so where where what we think as normal is not normal right so we think this world is well this is just how the world is because this is all we know but in reality this is not normal that's because the world has fallen apart so the reason I've kind of jumped to really right at the end of the church age because it's so allowed me just how you know our thinking can be so wok you could say based on our based on where we are in time and not and it's not based on the Word of God so we need to really look into these things to see well the world is this way we know the world has rapidly changed you know even my little 32 years the world has rapidly changed and it's changed a lot drastically these last few years that it has maybe you know the previous 32 years before I was born how society is how how how families are how you know how the West how the whole world has become has rapidly changed and the reason it has changed is because of this where we read they did not retain God in their knowledge neither were they thankful so there's a degradation of of society based on this where people change from worshipping God to they worship the creation now a lot of this I've already I preached a couple of years ago about making an idol out of part of Jesus so a lot of this is going to be kind of a reaping I'm going to expand upon it because we need to really you know it's quite shocking how different the world is now but our we we we the Bible says whatever the mind of Christ and this is the age where we have the mind of Christ so we've got to think through the mind of the word right we're going to think according to Scripture not according to culture or what society dictates is true and so we're just gonna go through a few things now as I ask the question now now how's this done and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like unto corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things now how how is this done sorry and and it's done by taking an attribute of God and making that into a god right c.split God into a multiple multiple membered body like instead of going from one God now you have many now this is shown and the there's just brother Prometheus now there's an identified Christ of all ages now there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just the eternal and him was attributes everyone knows what an attribute is in other words in him was as thoughts just thoughts that's his attributes in his word and a word Express I mean a thought expressed as a word in the beginning was the word before it was even expressed it was a thought an attribute in this thinking he was to be God probably created angels first then he wants to be worshiped he was God and then in him was was attributes to be father to be son to be Savior nothing lost something had to be lost so they had to be a way made for that to be a healer nothing sick so he had something had to get sick so he could heal it it's only displaying his attributes now remember if he ever did or ever will have eternal life you had it with him then see you had it with him because Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer to redeem anything as to bring it back from where it was fallen from or went from redeemed to bring it back Suren God was to be a redeemer was to be a savior was to be a king was to be a comforter was to be a guide was to sacrifice you know was to be many things was to be a father but he couldn't express those all by himself right but then what happens is man takes those attributes and he takes that HIV out of God and makes that a God now this is very plain in the in the ancient world where the Egyptians actually because they knew him as God the scripture says but they didn't retain them in their knowledge and they worship the creature more than the Creator so they took an attribute of God made an idol and said now this is a God I was gonna take three this is this is a small God a per serve you pronounce his name it's a bull deity served as an intermediary between humans and an all-powerful God so this is a God who's an intermediary but we know the scripture says for this one God what is but there is one God and one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus it's interesting that when the Egyptian when when the Israelites came out of Egypt what did they make as an idol they made a golden calf an intermediary right because they saw this in Egypt now then they fashioned it in the wilderness so they took a attribute of God and made it a God okay and then now and and this is the Egyptian god of creation so here here's now separate God but we know that God is the Creator rights they've taken part of God and made now now he's a separate going to take an attribute he's a creator right so they've now take split that off God they've made a separate God and then now here's a ERISA si think he's the god of the afterlife death life and resurrection but Jesus is I am the resurrection and the life right but Jesus also created all things and spirit for him right and he's also as the man he's intermediary so he's all those things but they split those attributes split them split it up into separate gods so now because of this man does not because they did this now they did not retain him retain God as he really was their knowledge made these gods and then now there's now a destructor a falling of mankind right so it all started when when man made idols took an attribute of God and made that as a separate God hey you're following me this is what happened because they all knew before the Egyptian gods ever came into being they knew him as the one true Living God right but then through the degradation of man you know Satan coming and perverting the work twisting it then now they have separate gods and it's all the way through it's all the way through the you know you can take you can take all mythology and you can actually take it back and show it's actually the one true Living God right even take the you know the Maori Maori myth avi of the win win win the sky God and the Earth Mother God was separated so heaven and earth was one but people couldn't be there and in this one God or whatever heat he caused him to separate so now there was a gulf between between heaven and earth and what happened in the garden because the gulf between heaven and earth because of sin right and that's where you see the you know there's the flood will injured and many different things you know many different cultures because they take what really happened and the devil perverts it and gives it to the people and they accept it and now the people begin to fall from what they should be into what we just read okay so you say well what does this got to do what does this got to do in our day God expressed himself from this day Jesus Christ came down revealed himself through a prophets ministry right the Son of Man was revealed on this day God came but the thing is they were not they they did not like to retain him retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a river raped by and because they chose creeds and dogmas above the true and living God what happened is it you know you know as I've said you take the span of John the Baptist to titus destroying Jerusalem that is that is repeating today in this church age where the destruction of you know the destruction of Jerusalem is that you'd say the as the Great Tribulation and the nuclear war at the end right the the destruction of this world but what happened there as they did not receive their Messiah they held on to their Creed's and of and they're you know and they're tradition they rejected him and then they went from there down to a massacre they're in the destruction of Jerusalem just as this world is the same thing has happened God has sent a forerunner he introduced Jesus Christ to the world the church world wouldn't accept Jesus Christ they kicked him out on the outside this world is falling apart and he'll end up in the Battle of Armageddon in a destruction right but before before thee before Titus came and actually um he actually besieged Jerusalem three times if you go look at history the first two times he had to go and he had to deal with other threats then he came back but then when Titus came the first time then the believers remember Jesus words when you see armies encompass about Jerusalem pray that your flight not being winter or on the Sabbath day because the winter time is when there was snow on the hills Sabbath day the gates were locked so the first time they came so all this is going to happen then Titus you know had to go deal with another threat then they all fled the city they were all gone then he came back the third time and then that was it it was a massacre but all the believers were gone when that happened just like when the great tribulation all the believers are gone because there's a rapture amen so there's a parallel just like brother Andy and brother Hadrian now they're writing a book of Acts in Vietnam they were sent into Vietnam it's all part of the you know in the book of expand you have the Galatian Church come you know you have the Corinthians you have the Ephesians you have this Allah likens you can see all the things that they fought against they were in their churches you see among believers today because it's all repeating right so now but the reason that this has happened is because they rejected him and they held on to their own religion that this is actually and but now we're just living in the time of you know we're just living in the result of that good people not speaking against people but we've got to think now our society has fallen to such an extent why has it because of a rejection of the son of man now so they and this is exactly you take this into the Christian world some some say gods all love and grace that's part of them or gods or rules and judgment that's part of them or God is just impersonal God that's not really too interested that's part of I mean you know that's what some people make him distant he's not distant God right but they take attributes of God they say he's all love mercy and grace here's all love mercy and grace or is all judgment there is judgment in there too right so people take a part of God and they split him up say this is who he is now we don't want to we want to take the whole person that's why Jesus Europe the Apostle says he's Express image of his person so you know yes my brother branham he said he you know he used to think that the father hated him but Jesus loved them but then he and so what is that now that is that is the cultural idea of God because they had a Trinity three three persons in the Godhead you can the only way you can have a person is if you have a personality right then you know so so what he's saying is they said well the father's this angry old man who pulls out judgment just like in the Old Testament visit and now here comes the son he loves everyone but then he found out that Jesus is the heart of God right so there those are two idols but now they were taken down side no he said Jesus Christ is the manifestation of the heart of God this is who I really am is what God is saying the Express image of his person right so when you see Jesus Christ the things he does you see this is actually the heart of God to the people amen that's why the Pharisees and things they didn't understand they say how can he be with sinners and drunkards and prostitutes all these things talking to them and here was God coming to seek and save those which he lost those God's heart right now I'm gonna read a few things he says but they rejected the Messiah when he come to them just exactly the way the prophecy said he would come and done the very things that the Bible said he would do but he didn't come according to the earth theology I hope that don't hurt but I hope it anchors deep and they come it showed his messianic sign just exactly the way the Bible he would do how many believes that sure you do what was the Messianic sign he was a God prophet see and then and when they did it what did they call that messianic sign can somebody tell me they called it what they call it Beelzebub a devil a fortune teller because he could perceive their thoughts and knowed what they were thinking tell them of these things and the true Jew what did they say it was its the Messiah the Messiah Nathanael said thou truly art the Son of God truly you're the king of Israel said because I told you I saw you before you came to the meeting then you believe it you'll be able to see greater things than this then right they say that they rejected the Messiah and this is what has happened again now we're just gonna read a few of these because I want to because of what I want to do and those services really say well a case the Society's falling apart now how does this affect me right because it it does affect us whether we like it or not we are not impermeable to the influence of the world right we're not immune to the spirit of the world and the culture and what it's trying to do we're not immune to it I said we'll overcome it the Bible says we'll overcome it but if we're going to overcome we have to wrestle against and have a battle right you don't just get a free pass or here you go you've won you know no you have to overcome something you have to overcome you can't just you know to him that overcometh you are granted to sit with his and his throne his Dominion as he sat down at his Father's throne right so we must overcome something okay so this is part of what I'm wanting to bring you know if we don't see I think I come here I said it last Sunday but the devil the devil's greatest victory as if people believe he doesn't exist that's the greatest victory because if you think he doesn't exist he can do what he wants but if you're aware he's there and he's trying to you know get you and get your family whatever more than you'll be on your guard okay so now and it comes and goes out the people does not recognize it till it's passed because it never fits their theology never fits the time of day you see what it is they're always living in the glare of another age always the reason they don't accept Jesus and they didn't accept Jesus because they're living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but came to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept them because his message wasn't exactly the way they had it all created out and it was and it was called the in traditions and he didn't come according to their traditions he didn't keep their traditions and really he upset it and tore it up and done things that was contrary to it and so much that they thought he was breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message and we all know today that he couldn't they couldn't and we all know today that he came exactly in the line of God's prophecy but they didn't know it then and it could happen again and they wouldn't know it I imagine if he'd actually appeared tonight would be so contrary to what we've all got figured out up on our charts and in our schools and things and be very few would recognize what's going on he said it would be how he would come right so it'll be very contrary history repeats itself man doesn't change now I want to jump to something know this this may seem this may seem very out of left field but I'm going to show you this picture now this is this is North Korea now this is the extreme now in the political this is not a political speak but in the in the political spectrum there's the right the ultra-conservative who wants to maintain and this is the left that wants to change there's the progressive and there's the conservative and the ultra now they have changed their communist theology a bit these ones but they are under communism where they throw out the old order completely and they bring in a new this is actually being extreme progressive view okay now our society is not this and I don't believe it'll come to this but our society is what we call a progressive society and in order to be a progressive society there has to be change you have to do away with what's there and not everything that was there was good okay so I'm not saying let's go back to the whatever times but what I'm trying to say is what I am saying is that in order to be progressive and to change society you've got to do away with what's already there now what happens is now we live in a country that's called a progressive country and there are good things about that okay there are good things about that but what happens is now as there has to be a done away with what has been in order to progress to something else but what are we progressing to that's what people don't know but then what happens is you got to see now why why do we have such high suicide rates why is it so much substance abuse why is there you know yo why is it like this why do why do children not grow up and become adults they may become physically adults but they're still children why is this it's because society's progressed right and if you look at now you look at communism and it's in its very raw form everyone is the same everyone is the same now but you can't have people being all the same Jesus gave the parable of the talents so he gave some five some two and one one so everyone has a different measure of gift just like if we all tried to stare come and play the violin there'd be some who extremely good and some who are terrible and there be everyone in between because God has made us all different right but now what what what this does what society is going to is that the individual is not important it is the group that matters it's the individual is not important so what happens as society is telling us now essentially that you don't matter and I know people because I'm in the science field people have chosen not to have children because they have been taught they're just another part of the gene pool and therefore gone having children and having family and having marriage or whatever because they have been taught by their CEO gee that they're just another part of the gene pool and they don't matter it's true so so so what society has moved in such a way that they try to tell you you don't matter and that's why people want to get rid of themselves so I think well life's too bad too hard I can't handle this so I'm just gonna try and get out because I don't matter anyway you do matter you matter to God right you're important to God you're important to him right if Jesus died for one he would have died for you amen if he you know if he just seems Elijah to turn the hearts just one he would have sent him all the same right you're important to God you must never forget that because the Christian walk is individual right it's not a group thing yes it you know only it's it's individual show we're a body but the body is made up of members and the members are important we are important but in this kind of system the individual is not important right and that's what this now this is an extreme example we won't get to this I don't believe but this is where we're shifting where the individual doesn't matter the individual you you matter right I want to I want to pour this in if I can yeah you are you're important and you made it to God right you are important to him never let the world try and think well you're just another bunch of genes and you know nothing's important and there's 7 billion of us plus so it doesn't matter if I'm here or not it's important you're here God wanted you here ok he say well how did this creepin I want to know he sees here in Deuteronomy now what happens is I just I just I just come to the end of then come to back here see see where I'm going what happens is God raises up nations to bring judgment on other nations and and I'll show you that with Nebuchadnezzar and different ones that God raised them up God even said you're my servant ibeacon is ax in the occult Cyrus is Sheppard and they were raised up to bring judgment on Israel because they turn to other gods but then after that God said I'm going to deal with him because of what they and we'll show you in the scripture but what what what I wanted to show it this is that the thing that was raised up to destroy was actually already working in the people you take Israel by worshipping gods they had their idols you know they had all their different things going on where they get them from the nations around them and then what happened was those nations around them were risen up to deal with them well the bram said that the that Russia will drop a bomb on the Vatican he said communism was risen up because they rejected God poured a spirit out and Russia before he did it in Azusa Street but they rejected it and God raised up communism and then and then that and and then that tried to destroy all the real religion in the country right and so now God has risen that up to destroy the Vatican the world because of because of they've rejected God okay I just want to show you this because the spirit that was there in Babylon was already working in Israel because of the worship they were doing as I said we're not immune you say well I'm not a mean to what the world is doing the world is trying to change your thinking and when it comes down to the family level okay well I'm gonna go somewhere with us unless they see Deuteronomy 4 he says take heed unto yourselves lest you forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you and made you and make your graven image or a likeness of anything which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire even a jealous God when thou shalt beget beget children and children's children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or a likeness of anything and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God to provoke him to anger I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land or upon you go over the Jordan to possess it you shall not prolong your days upon it but shall be utterly destroyed and the Lord shall scatter you among the nations and you shall be left fewer number among the heathen whether the Lord shall lead you and there you shall serve gods and works of man's hands wood and stone was neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell see is the reason this will happen because you're worshipping gods that are not me right so the spirit that so the spirit that was in the nation that was rose enough to destroy them was already working in their worship in Israel okay now we've seen him now as I see it now but then also this is shown because man and woman have fallen from their position right from from what the Bible says a family should be the the family the average family is not how it should be why is that because it's because a progressive spirit is coming and change what means should be in what woman should be and how family should be okay this is now because what's happened now is look they've all got the same Army uniform on all the workers you know it because they become just just it doesn't matter if you're male or female just everyone becomes one and what's happened now people become gender fluid all these different things everyone's become just becoming one and unfortunately it's the influence of the spirit in the world so it's not the person if either they're looking for identity 99% of them they're looking for identity they've been heard and rejected growing up because their family life is broken so they don't know where they belong and these people will accept them so I'll go join them because there's a degradation of because the degradation of family has happened because the relationship between parents and children have broken yeah you say well this isn't all that happy well it is happy actually because if you can identify the enemy then you could work against them amen because so now I say men men have fallen in this day what a real man is us even in history man hasn't really been man brother Brahim seed without the Holy Ghost man is less than a bit he's actually lower than an animal an unconverted manners lower than an animal and so now but what the holy ghost were you made into the image of God right but now what happens is Society has attacked man being the head of the home right they have but the thing is now the reason that there has been a backlash this is myself it's because man has been like a dictator right man has been like a dictator so there's been a revolution we've been oppressed they probably have been a priest to a large extent but then there's a rising up because man has been a dictator because man has not been in this place God because the thing is you're going to look especially especially you dad's that your children will look at God subconsciously they will relate to God how they relate to you and they may not ever really fit or really comprehend I'm actually related to God how you relate to me they don't do it consciously but that's how it will be so if you're an angry distant father who has never been pleased by any actions the child has done they will think God is a distant angry father that I can never please right so how they view God as how as as your relationship will influence the relationship with God so we have to we have to be very careful how we how we raise our chili how we act around them how we are that's why I say no this affects everyone how society is fallen well it'll try and drag us down too but God doesn't want us to be dragged down he wants us to come because this is an age of adoption an age where we come to our position in Christ right it's not only and that that position that we had joint is with him we come to that we're in that position that now is reflected now how we are in our family and how we treat one another oh yeah says likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word you may they may also without the word be won by the conversation of the wives conversation as manner of life I mean that's why he can live a sermon I mean you can live Redemption haloo you can live it amen while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adoring their to be not outward adoring of plaiting the hair of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be of the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price they men that doesn't mean your little church mouse you understand but God is saying I'm making quite spirit of great price in my sight but that's not that's not what a woman is projected to be in this age for after this manner and old time the holy woman also who trusted in God adorned themselves being and subject unto their own husbands even as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughter ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise he husbands now this is really really well really where I want to get to likewise he husbands you know it's amazing Abraham and Sarah call she called him Lord must have been something he was doing likewise he husband's dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life not that your prayers be not hindered so at sea so it's actually it's actually the conduct of the husband actually dictates where their present ended or not right it's not the other it's not the spouse it's not the wife it's actually the husband you know men get so frustrated why why not why not why not they need to look in the mirror and say well this is why not weirdo I don't want my priest to be hindered now in the fall before the fool Adam and Eve had a perfect relationship man in the fall after the fall for a large very large extent doesn't talk a lot man is not really a talker right you know a lot of mean I know it's one I know who talks all the time but that's the only one a lot a lot of mark great communicators and they become very easily become very withdrawn within themselves we've got a break and I'm talking especially to myself we've got to break out of that right because God is not someone who always hides himself away and doesn't speak right remember we had to be has got it and we'll go to the book of Ephesians but as God us to the church we're to be to our our our wives right so he says now that we would know the reason I underlined a few things and so dwell with them according to knowledge now we'll get into that but you see Peter here is writing to Jews now the under the Testament are you under the Old Covenant of the blood of bulls and goats woman were second-class citizens and his rather than men right and this was showing and of the law the blood of bulls and goats could never bring the woman could bring the church up to be joined is with God joint heirs with Christ right but now under the blood of Jesus Christ now he says that we are that being is together of the grace of life so is together so you're you're jointly he's trying to tell the husbands you and your wife or years of life together you're you're both of joint is right because under the blood of Jesus Christ now this is showing that under the blood Jesus Christ we are not under we are not under God separate he lifts us up to where he is we are that we are joint heirs right so now Paul a Peter rather has to tell the juiceless because their thinking is still Old Testament thinking because that's their culture that's how they've been raised but he's trying to tell no you're not they're not sitting close to you anymore sure you still the head but they are joint heirs of life together with you so now but now he says and in the first part dwell with them according to knowledge now that doesn't mean just live in the same house well I know what my addresses there no it's not you got to dwell he says you got to know how to dwell with your wife you have to know how to dwell with your family now dwell in the Greek it means to reside together as a family dwell together and it also means that first part that word as primary preposition is denoting a union so he says you got to dwell so if you're dwelling as you're to dwell as one together according to knowledge so you have to know how to how to treat your family you've got to know how to have a relationship with your family right but what has happened this day men has become separated from his family and that's the not just in working but you see how you know especially in the teenage years and I I'm glad I've I've got past those years but I can see it you know when we talk about the world has fallen apart I was I'm a millennial and so I was raised in an era where the world is already broken and so now the the most important thing now this is meat but this is how I feel the most important thing is 1 the spiritual welfare of your family right but also the emotional development of your family of your children that's very important because what happens is the the world gets ahold of because the family becomes distant because you know just like and yeah as I've said and Daniel is that fourth beast power comes to divide divide and conquer break into pieces he comes down that spirit comes down into the family he divides husband from wife children from parents he comes to divide and conquer so now mums off doing her thing dad's off doing his thing children off doing their own thing and the family bond is broken the family bond is broken there's been studies done to show that a child develops so much better emotionally if the family has done it together real simple things are that they show on average it doesn't world look good for a child and here we are this is something I you know I sometimes forget but you know sometimes we think well we're just having dinner and it may not mean a lot to us cuz we're just eating we've done this for you is right you've had dinner I trust you've had dinner for years you know and you get used to but but to them it's actually a big because they sit down and now this is maybe just me but you sit down you're trying to eat and then now I'm having four conversations at once which is good but now he's a forum now I can sit down we can talk about our day we can you know just things start coming and you're trying to have full conversations at once and it's very hard but what if what if we didn't do that who are they going to talk to who are they going to find out the entity with right because because man is made to look for their identity we are born every nation under heaven they're looking for identity where do I fit in society where am i from you know what are my roots whatever it may be they're all looking for identity so if they cannot find our density in the home they'll find identity elsewhere right and you become what you identify with right and it says the same and that's why God comes in revelation that's why this message is so precious to me he tells me where I'm from he tells me who I am in him he tells me what he's done for me and he tells me where I'm going what he tells me my true identity hallelujah that's why I love being a Christian because I know run from I know I'm going I Know Who I am right and so this is my identity that's why being a believer is more than just something we do on a Sunday it's an everyday affair because this is who I am I can't separate this from me cuz this is who I really am hallelujah but with so but then without so God so the world is trying to give you a different identity but God wants to give you a real one but depends where your heart is that's where your treasures will be also so if you're if the Fe if the family's all split up then the children will look for their identity elsewhere and then their heart will go there right so now we have to know how to dwell with our wives according to knowledge we have to just living in the same house is not what this is talking about you have to know how to relate to them you have to know their needs remember Jesus didn't come to see what I you know come meet my needs apostles he came to meet their needs he came to meet the world's needs right and man but man is selfish for yo carnal man we have to the Holy Spirit in us overcomes this thing as long as we stay yielded we we die daily right that's why it's such a thing the the believer brother Bram says you know as an American I have rights to drink and smoke and whatever but he says as a Christian you forfeit your rights right you give your rights over you have no more I have no more rights anymore right because I've given them all to him right but if I think I have rights then I become selfish because what's entitled to me but if you've given your rights over you're not looking for what you can get but what you can give and that's what Lord you gave it all to me so I want to give it all to you hallelujah I'm glad he portals her whole life out I mean he wasn't just wounded but he died hallelujah laid his life down for a sheep ah hallelujah I'm glad I'm one of them so we're gonna know how to dwell according to knowledge now you say well how on earth do I do that because what what we have to understand is that man and woman are different man and woman are different spiritually we are different right because when when God made man in the garden as Genesis when he made male and female and the image of God God is a spirit so he made God as a spirit man Genesis 2 he formed him out of the dust of the earth you know look at those words created in Chapter 1 and formed and chapter 2 they're two different words one's a creation and one's a forming of a body right so he took he made man as male and female put them in a body Adam they took the feminist part of that spirit took it out of took it out of Adam took the rib and you know a rib it's been medically proven you can remove a rib or certain way and it grows back do you know that because sometimes you count how many ribs do I have and if I'm a man I should have one less and people stumble of it now because if it's removed a proper way it'll grow back medical science and God's the best surgeon right and yeah yeah brother Graham says yo God would have taken this for a brought him just over the heart hello yeah that's how it should be I mean say was didn't take one done he took he took the room out of the hot you know you got to have a revelation that your wife is actually part of you a mint you got to have that revelation that she is part of me and why did you have a revelation he is part of me both ways hallelujah just like with the Lord you have a revelation I'm part of you Amen I'm not adjust to something you picked up that was floating along now you come to seek and save that which is lost hallelujah Amen hey you got to know I'm one of them I'm part of him that's why he died for me that's why he's come to redeem me amen I'm glad I'm part of him hallelujah so so now the Lord takes that rib takes the feminist part of Adam spirit puts it an eighth so now they're two separate people what we would see instituted for bill but God views it was one because their name was still Adam but then after the fall then eight then Adam gives us gives his wife's name Eve their one else different because now no man was over the woman right it has been you know in terms of being in charge but but now a woman has a feminist spirit and a man has a masculine spirit right we have to and that's why you know there's the same woman a Mina from mars women are from venus you know so separate I don't understand these people that's because they don't yeah well if you're a man you know you're made different and God made us a certain way you know I'm just happy how God made me in spite of all my things I see about myself I'm not very happy with I say thank you Lord for making me me because God doesn't make a mistake right so now we come down to the whole fact well how do we how on earth do we dwell with them according to knowledge now the reason I'm bringing these things is because this is what enemies come against he he wants to break brother I'm sit if you break womanhood you break motherhood you've broken a nation that's what the prophet Valley does motherhood he says if you break that in and say fatherhood he said mother you break real motherhood the nation's gone and it's happened so now we want to we want to go into these things just say well this is how we should be now well I've submit your yourselves we have that their wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's and in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleans it into the washing of the water of the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes that even as the Lord the church see st. you could ever you know recognize this is your own self right she is part of me hallelujah I say isn't it glorious we can be born on the opposite side of the world different families whatever God brings us together oh yeah I love that amen so now you say well so basically what Paul is saying is as as God loved you you have to love you that's how you have to love your wife right that's what he's saying so you say well then if that's the case then what do I want from God okay what do I want from God because of you husbands if you know what you want from God or what you need from him then you know what your wife needs from you okay so here's just a list and it's probably not complete unconditional love love is not shared with another acceptance of who we are right understanding want to be understood securely in the relationship so that's why I believe in eternal security amen provision I want to be provided for this is now this is me what do I want from God what do I need I need unconditional love because I see all my flaws and failures right love is not shared with another I want a unique relationship Lord I'm not just one of many in a sense we are but in a sense we're not right because the bride is multi-member body right but our relationship is unique we are individual with him we're not just a number never think you're just a number and it doesn't matter from here if I'm not you matter you matter one person can change your whole service right you being here can change the whole service you being here can change their eternal destination of one person you're important God died for you for a purpose that he would become one with you hallelujah he didn't just hang between heavens and earth and say well one day maybe someone will feel sorry for me and and and and and following me no he knew who would be there and he redeemed you for a purpose he wants to express himself that's why there's the earth the universe everything that's here that's why you wants to express himself to you hallelujah aren't you glad you don't have some distant God that doesn't talk I mean but he wants relationship holiness what is the deep calling to the deep people that deep in your soul because he wants to become one with you he was to spend eternity with you he wants to walk this life's journey with you holy just like Enoch he walked with God and he was not because God took him he walked with God hallelujah and that's just a shadow of us a type of us that we can walk with him every day amen provision that's why we're going to provide for our families but that's not the only thing of being a husband right Comfort we need this is how to draw them we need comes our need comforting God has to cover me quite a lot hallelujah our relations now this is maybe is be a repeat of one of the others but our relation that is unique to me alone so it's not your buddies that know your deepest desires and ambitions right hopes and dreams it's me your spouse should be your best friend right your spouse should be your ah but she won't understand well that's where you've got to come and she doesn't understand me well what's wrong then she should understand you better than them she should understand you way better than your buddies oh but there's some things I just can't talk to her about is that is that how God feels about us you know he tells Abraham Abraham's just a friend of God before Saaremaa gamora's burn he says could I withhold from my friend what I'm about to do he begins to share this is what's going to happen here after tells them what his plan is right now and goddess all the mystery of God is revealed in the same time that we know all of his heart all of his embers everything he wants there is nothing that's worth holding from us hallelujah he whispers thanks to you that many people may don't ever know it's just like there's many things my wife knows that multitude they have no idea about even close friends how Lou yeah because she is my best friend I'm glad that's true that's actually true how Lou yeah that's how it should be never think they will not understand you and this goes vice-versa because if you think you know that's the problem we we think God does not understand our situation Jesus was a child he was a teenager he was an adult he knew what it was like to lose family where was Joseph when he became old but says because he died right he whipped when Lazarus was was dead because that was his friend he had compassion he felt sorry for the others that lost he knew as the resurrection but as a man he wept because there was his friend was dead and he felt sorry for the others that had just suffered loss right he knows what it's like to go without he knows what it's like to be misunderstood amen hey who played at school you don't have put up hands but he know we used to play this game and I've run away from a certain person there's a primary school because they were different to us run away now here's Jesus now I've seen this polly well I have seen it before here's Jesus a twelve-year-old boy you think about him for a second they go to Jerusalem is the capital is the temple these the citadel of the romans whatever yeah there's all these cool sites is the battlements there's the gates there's the whatever here was David did this here and you know where does he go he goes to the temple and what does he do he doesn't just say how wonderful it is like a tourist he goes and any because it talked to the scribes and the high priests and you know he forgives it talking about the scripture this not a normal 12 year old boy who's on holiday even it's a real it's a pilgrimage but she was still a bit of a holiday change of scenery there's not a normal 12 year old he was different he would have been this is me I believe they would have probably played that game with him this play ran away from Jesus because he was different right he knows what it's like to be despised and rejected I mean he knows he knows everything we have gone through right but the thing is we think the devil puts it in our mind he doesn't understand me because he's never gone through it he's gone through it he was tempted on all points but yet without sin and there's nothing new Under the Sun see he was tempted anything that we are tempted worth he faced and he was tempted by it so so it was a temptation right he was but yet without sin see he understands what it's like to be in your shoes and I'm saying this is because many people think he doesn't understand me you you normally turn to people that understand you right that's why you think growing up well mom and dad don't understand me see go to your friends and that's not a way that's not the best place to go cuz what are they really know relative to the grand scheme of things you only find this out when you get older but they can relate to you because they understand you and your parents had fought the same same thing growing up just in a different way the same Devils that we fight as parents I mean our children will fight we've already fought they just they just rebrand every so often it's the same spirit it's the same they just go through a rebranding once in a while and and then and then us growing up we think well our parents won't understand this and they've already fought the thing and so what happens is now the devil gets it in our minds well they don't understand me God doesn't understand me so I'll turn to these people and they sure can't help you all there well right God understands you Jesus has been in your shoes and he's far suffered far worse than what you have suffered right and I'm saying that is that you got a I pray you under have a revelation that see you can turn to him right amen now attention I want God's attention hey man I want as a teacher do you want as a teacher it's like brother bury me see it about thee was a king Georgia saying going through Canada and all the all the school kids go out and you everyone's you know along the street waving their flag and shouting and things and they will go back to the school and there's one little girl missing they all panic and they run they find her behind a lamppost or something crying and and and this is along the parade route and then the teacher picks her up what's wrong honey you know didn't you see the king yes I did but I don't know if he saw me that's why she's upset Jesus always sees us amen forgiveness and not for us to be reminded of our mistakes and failings amen he doesn't use our past against us the devil uses our past against I meant you got to remind the devil of his future I mean nothing to come between us I don't want anything between me and my Savior but then I also want leadership where are we going what's our plan but what's happened Mina's been reduced to this day that it's just the weekend week out same thing no no no desire to do anything where are we going my god is a God that leads he doesn't push a Cerises follow me children let's go right he led the children of Israel from Egypt into the Promised Land right he leads us I mean out of the world into him he leads us and he leads us from there all the way into glory amen so you gotta have a sense where are we where are you going as a family right you got to have a view that's why I mean many men they they grow up by they don't grow up they want to stay as boys because I haven't made the transition of actually taking responsibility of one their own lives and one maybe their family that they've collected they find themselves in this in this way you got to have leadership where are you going you can't be led by God unless you're walking right yeah yep now this is this is from the fall I just thought I'd take this is very interesting and he said I heard the this is Adam speaking now and I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked I had myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked how sour eaten of the tree which I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman this is his response now the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat he's passing the blame this is fallen man it's this person's fault and actually he's actually pointing the finger of God got it your fault the woman you gave me God it's your fault this is your fault I'm in this predicament now it was Adams responsibility because Eve was deceived and he wasn't he went with his eyes open and that's by him by one cent to the world right but this is this is full and man's response well it's your fault and this and this and this you've got to take responsibility and Eve yo you say you gotta say well it is actually my fault I'm wrong help me Lord I'm sorry I stuffed up amen but that's the this is full of man's it's always passing the buck we shouldn't pass the buck hold on to the buck God wants you to take responsibility God God takes responsibility he takes responsibility for you right he took responsibility fair demand Eve in the garden that he not so he what he wants you to take responsibility as well now those are some things that has been degraded in this day we don't want to we don't want to fall into that same trap we have to take our god-given position according to his scripture according to his word right but this is but these are some of the things now I don't know what the maybe we'll just close there because I'll go to something else and we'll pick it up next time but I want you to think about this this is all not selfish right this is all not selfish and also because you think God when when when we were out in the world in chaos who came to us God came to us he came to us first he initiated it right and every part you are from Genesis t in the revelation who's actually initiating the changes of dispensation it's God God came to Abraham Abraham didn't go to God he called him out right God you know and then and then they were you know and then now Jesus comes who was God came to the earth now sir now is the dispensation of grace there was a law before it now it's disposition of grace right God initiates it now there's the end time who's causing the end time God is causing it I said about yo from a mrs. Shalom the lights causing the darkness to come together but it's doing it right so God is initiating it so God always initiates salvation it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance right so we as men have to actually take the forefront get out of our comfort zone amen let's where are we going as a family we're going into a rapture now how do we get there you're gonna break it down right and the thing is you say well this person's like this I can even become like that the scripture says if we compare ourselves with ourselves who are unwise we should compare ourselves with the Word of God amen you say look yo yo and I've said many times this front so a lip of God see it about the scripture and the message he says he says when he reached this when he listens to the message Lord he says there's a this is God in print as the person revealed same thing with the message Jesus Christ revealed she's saying as I read this and listen mold my character to become like your character it's not about just learning things up here I mean but God would make change me to be like him right because through the scripture this is the character of Jesus Christ being revealed same thing with the message it's more than just doctrine right we got another doctrine sure but there's a person being expressed and we're to become like him amen so now these things are all unselfish we have to be like this and the thing is as I said now God initiates we respond right and then now we come into our position but there comes a time where after that where the Bible says draw nigh to mantled and I'll draw nigh to you you've got to be sensitive to those times amen you've got to be sensitive to those times because now my family has try to draw nigh to me and with little children sometimes they can just be naughty hey bad attention is better than no attention apparently but apparently that's that's true so people and you can take that in a family children can be acting out what's because they want attention is actually a need that is deeper than what's manifesting in them you gotta say Lord what is the real need in that child I mean we're not here just to you know it's like a house on fire and and the fire spreading to the bushes in the fire you know you know pushes around we you got to put out the house first and then you can deal with the shrubbery that's on fire right but sometimes we just see the bushes we just put that out but we don't get the underlying cause of what's going on that's why I gotta take you everything to God in prayer amen he is still through the sooner thoughts intents of the heart right he can tell you this is what's going on with my family my child well what's happening in this situation lord I don't understand you show you something in the scripture to tell you right and so now we have to and then and then you can take that even even in a church body there can be trouble but what's really under that trouble we have to be sensitive of those things amen but we got I'm just gonna leave it there but the enemy and so I said that's why I brought him that before that this world being progressive as it is now it was the wife way what has been and it doesn't care what that is even if it is good it wants to get rid of it and this is already very much in this country very much in this society that we live in in the West and you got to think now well how has this affected my thinking this is what I wanted to preach as well because you got to think now how is my thinking is it is it is it lift of Sinta right of center or is it directly on the scripture according you know you got to think about it my outlook at how I treat my my family and everything is it is this actually godly or is it just am I just a product of my environment I mean we should we should look into these things because we can't just take for granted well this is just how everything is no we should look at say Lord am I being a godly father or a godly mother a godly husband godly wife godly child am i living that is a way that's pleasing to you I don't want my prayers to be hindered I want to dwell with my wife have a wonderful relationship I mean we want to dwell you know it says dwell with them according to knowledge help us lord I want to draw them according to knowledge right remember a family is not meant to be a battlefield it's not us and them and I'm going to win here and I'm going to cause him to lose here and you know now now you're the you know I'm in government you're the opposition this is how we'll get a pass this legislation you've got you know no it's not that way it's not that way a family is not meant to be divided but family is divided in this in this day an hour you know say well it shouldn't be that way
