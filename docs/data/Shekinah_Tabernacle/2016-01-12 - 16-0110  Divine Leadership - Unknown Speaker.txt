god bless you have you had a good holiday amen also kelly welcome god bless boom god bless you you are you going home this week okay well lord be with you in your travels nice to have you here with us trust you had a good time amen praise the lord um you could turn with me to uh romans chapter eight and um actually let's go to first john chapter two and then we'll go to romans chapter eight so first john chapter 2 and read verses 20 down to 29 and um we did read this last sunday but i want to kind of take it in another direction uh today it says but you have an ancient from the holy one and you know all things i have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a lie but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son who so whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledges the son has the father also let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning if that if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the son and the father this is the promise that he has promised us even eternal life these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches teacheth you of all things and his truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you you shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear you may have confidence and and not be ashamed before him it is coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him and let's go to romans chapter 8 and i'm sure it's a very familiar piece of scripture to to us all but uh we'll just start from verse six it says this here for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot find so they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ begin you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are deaders not of the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you live through the spirit but if you if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many and this is read the verse one to get to for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry abba father the spirit itself witness without spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs ears of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us i mean let's just bow our heads together word of prayer gracious heavenly father we like to thank you lord for your word thank you it is a living word father that you are not a stagnant god of history but you're living and unfolding yourself even down to this day and father we want to thank you that you're alive lord that the tomb is empty and lord it's more lord we know you've resurrected not just because the tomb is empty because you're alive and the things you said you'd do in this hour you're doing and father i pray as we just opened your word now lord you're the great author of it father and dear lord we're not worthy of it lord we pray you'd come down and open your word to us father dear lord that you would reveal yourself through your word to us oh god and father may just anoint speaker and hearer one more time father we could leave this place changed law because of your transforming power father may you grant that lord and father we want to pray for brother andy dear lord he's up in la vino fielding lord he's he's preaching there oh god give him a clear channel of inspiration father feed your sheep up there i pray through him oh god father may their hearts be burning within them as you speak to them along the way father we pray these things lord have your way among us oh god in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated now i'd like to i'd like to try and approach the subject and i i don't think i'll be able to uh could you just turn this down a bit um i want to i want to speak on divine leadership this morning you know i was walking down the stairs at work i think it was a thursday or wednesday and just those two words dropped into my heart divine leadership and it's very it's you know it's a vital subject because you know we are led by either two things and the scripture itself is a record of two leaderships it's it's the record of god's divine leadership and it's also the record of satan's religious leadership there's only two and i'm going to show that to you soon so we must be everyone is led by something now in the message leadership in 65 he says now remember this is brother brown speaking each one of us young and old your first step that you ever made in your life someone had to lead you that's right and your last step you ever make someone will be leading you someone has to lead god has likened us unto sheep and if anyone knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep while you know that a sheep cannot find its way around he has to be led and then the same same message he says now there's something in nature watch the birds watch the animals watch everything and you watch nature watch the little dove how he flies what a different bird he is see he doesn't have any gall he can't eat like the crow can see he has no gall in him he doesn't have to take a bath in the water because he's got something on the inside of him it cleans him out from the inside out you see and that's the way the christian is that's the way god represented himself in a dove because jesus was represented as a lamb always in nature you'll find god and god likened us unto sheep that has to be led did you ever notice there he says the lamb coming down on the dove to lead the lamb it and it led him to the slaughter so when jesus was baptized john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and john saw the spirit of god like a dove descend upon him so those two natures came together if the lamb the dove could not have descended upon any other type of animal because they both had to have the same nature see if the dove would have lit upon a wolf it would have snorted or growled the what the dove would have taken its flight well it's the same way now and our ill ways the holy spirit just takes this flight and goes away it's got to have the same nature the birds of heavens the dove the meekest animal on earth the lamb they can agree together and when the holy spirit comes upon us and makes us new creatures then he can lead us but we try to live the same old life it won't work it just won't work now the first step you've probably ever taken in your life speaking of leadership it was probably the hands of some kind of mother them hands may be still tonight out there in some cemetery somewhere but that was the hand that led you to make your first step then after mother taught you how to walk and you would make a few steps and fall down and get up and you thought you were doing great things then she turned you over to the school teacher and then she began to lead you to education and how and what you must do and how you must learn and so forth like that then after the school teacher got through with you then you return back your father got a hold of you and then your father got a hold of you he taught you perhaps your business how to be a successful businessman how to do things right your mother taught you to be a housewife how to cook and so forth like that but after they got through with you then your minister or priest got a hold of you but then you asked the question but now who leads you now who leads you there's only two now uh yeah i've been thinking about this because this is this is very vital this is incredibly vital because if you look in the bible as i said there's two leaderships there's god's divine leadership or this satan's religious leadership both were religious both claim to worship god both claim to be the true but only one was divinely led amen i mean it's the same thing today it doesn't change so we need to think about these things so everyone so everyone is led now if this is a bit laborious today i'm just sorry this is just how it came to me everyone is led by something and even though so i'll just list a few because there's god and there's a whole bunch of other things but jesus said very simply in matthew 12 30 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me is scattered abroad so it doesn't matter what category you may say what the other campers are leading people jesus said very simply if you're not with me you're against me that's it there's only two there's not three or fifty there's two amen so if you're not with him and how can two walk together unless they'll be agreed amen you can't you can't actually walk with god without agreeing with him and the only way you agree with me say yes i take you your word lord and surrender to it that's the only way you can be with him so in reality man is either led by the holy ghost or he's not now let's look now i'm just going to look a list of a couple of knots people just say just follow your heart who's heard people say that just follow your heart just be true to yourself you know but then in jeremiah jeremiah says in jeremiah 17 verse 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who could know it i mean so how can people say well i'm just going to follow my heart but but god is saying through jeremiah the heart of man is desperately wicked so i'm not going to trust me i'm not going to trust my feelings i'm not going to trust well i just have a gut feeling to go this way who says the gut feeling's right i mean who you know who says it's right well i feel this way you've got to be careful remember what are you being led by yeah just because you come to church i believe the message what are you being led by because it's an individual affair between you and god ultimately it's him leading you that's right so you've got to you've got to take these things so he says the heart is deceitful above all things and that's because man is born with a fallen nature to begin with yeah so you can't trust your heart well i just need to get no you can't do that and then he says in the next verse he says i the lord search the heart i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings so god actually weighs it up saying well is this right or is this wrong amen because everyone thinks uh you know i read the scripture i think a month ago every man is right in their own eyes that's what the scripture says every man is right in their eyes so every man can justify their position whatever they're doing in life you know and and they and then in their own mind they can say i'm absolutely justified i have a right to do what i'm doing you can't hold on you can't go that way you have to you've got to take it back you've got to take it back to this yes amen you've got to everyone has to have an absolute and if you're absolute is well my heart feels to do this you got the wrong absolute i mean but if you can take it back to something that's solid that's been proven that's been vindicated over and over again amen and not what you think about it what god says about it amen amen and then he also says in in jeremiah 10 because man relies on his own ability you know say you see the civilization we're in it is man's achievement this is what we can do yeah you know what could let's build a better one than the next nation you know let's let's let's have our you know our better way of doing things and they put their minds together and they and man has achieved incredible things but jeremiah says in chapter 10 verse 23 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct the steps so jeremiah was saying it's not actually in it's not actually it man you know the way of man is not in himself and that word way is actually the trodden way the way of life and you can see that abundantly because you see israel here's jeremiah you know babylon's going to come and and destroy them and take them into captivity and you ask the question how did they get in that predicament that's right they left the leader they left divine leadership and now and they're following their own ways they are religious they are god's chosen people amen they didn't deny jehovah flat right but they had left divine leadership and now following their own ways and that's how they ended up in this predicament because if they just followed god's provided way they would never been carried away into captivity but moses said this would happen in deuteronomy he said this was going to happen and it was happening and no doubt no doubt when the children of israel there and moses you read deuteronomy he says if you turn from god this is what's going to happen to you he says he gives blessings and cursings he says the cursing is the result of turning from god's word and no doubt that generation that was there they heard moses speak these things yeah because you know i put myself you know where the believer is in the word and no doubt they'd have in their heart i'm going to teach this to my children we are not going to be taken out of this land that god's given us we're going to stand according to his word it's not going to be my generation that's going to go into captivity that would have been their burden amen but then as generations went down it shifted from divine leadership now to human leadership so now it is not in man to direct the steps and that's why people say well i just want to go my own way you can't go your own way you can't go this little and you you're thinking you say well people think well i can just plan it out i can put all the facts out and go according to that that's what the world has been doing why do we have war why do we have death why do we have greed and famine and all these different things because man has said i'm going my own way the world has the ability to wipe out poverty the world has the ability to wipe out hunger it has the ability but the greed of fallen man doesn't let it happen why because man is going its own way now and it's also but the main course of the problem is man is not willing to humble itself to the leadership of god man is not willing to humble itself and it even says in james 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resists the proud but he give us grace unto the humble so god actually actively resists the proud amen proud and religion proud and whatever it may be god resists those people and i think they're doing the right thing but you see you know so man man in itself you know there was a there was a podcast radio thing over in america that's called the art of happiness or the pursuit of happiness and these people say just look within yourself this is not that many years ago they said just just just look within yourself you'll find happiness do you know what happened to the two people the husband and wife that that founded that thing they put bags over their head and they put tubes in there and they killed themselves they they guessed themselves and these are the people saying you'll find the yo yo you'll find happiness if you just look within yourself and look where they ended up and i just feel sorry for them because they were saying because they just said no man has it within themselves to to find happiness man doesn't have man sure does not have it in themselves i'm sure you can agree that's why there's pain there's broken families there's all these pains and hurts in the world because man says i'm going to do it my own way they reject the leadership of god and they are led by something else and it's normally their own selfish ambition that takes them there now let's go to ephesians chapter 2. ephesians two verse one because you see you know if this isn't such a shouty happy service it's all right i can't have expected it but you know i don't mind but it's very important you say what am i being led by you you really got to think about it so ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1. and we'll you know let's just read the verse first two verses and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so paul was saying to these ephesians that had come out of what whatever they came out of they came into christ are sealed into the kingdom he said one time you actually been governed by it you're being led by something else you're being led by the spirit of the prince of the power of the air that's what he's saying here he's saying your your leadership was not god at one time you're being led by a demon spirit there's only two this shouldn't shock you free it shouldn't it shouldn't be shocking at all and you know no doubt it didn't matter what what what facet of society they are from didn't matter what religion they had they'd just been governed they walked according to the course of this world they were led you know and paul just in that one statement encompasses all of humanity amen he said once upon a time you're walking this way but then now another leadership has come into your life because we're all led by something yeah so he's saying now one time you you walked according to this spirit so this this this unseen and maybe they had no idea of spiritual things i don't know but he's trying to open their understanding that that actually the road you were going down it wasn't you ultimately doing it but you yield yourself to another inspiration to another spirit leading you and but then he says now he says also in verse three among whom you also also we all had our conversation which is manner of life and times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins is quicken us together with christ by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages that come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works least any man should boast we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them now a multitude of people quote that scripture and a multitude of people say that's me i was delivered from something and now i'm a christian but then now you take those people remember i said last sunday an orange tree produces oranges you don't judge the orange tree you just discern well it makes oranges and then an apple tree produces apples fig tree figs you know it's just what they make but jesus said now if they you know he said yeah i am the vine you are the branches so a certain fruit will be produced from the true believer a life will be produced that is that is particular only to the true believer and so we have to look now you take you know everyone who you know you know who can quote this verse and they believe um a whole myriad of different things and they have all different kind of understandings on the scripture i ask the question what is leading them and and and i put the true believer in that bracket you take all of christianity and that all quote that scripture jesus blood is save me i believe in the cross but what is what is being produced and what is leading them yeah i'm taking this deliberately slow because i want it to sink in pretty deep you know so because jesus said when the spirit of truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth so if there's people so there are people upon the earth that are being led and guided into all truth amen those people are under divine leadership but there's also people upon the earth that are not being led into all truth amen yeah this may be very elementary but you know you have to say well you're making a true and a false absolutely there's a true and a fault you've got to test the spirits you've got to actually discern now is this god or is this not god if it is god give everything to it if it's not just forget about it amen and then you got to bring it down into your own life am i am i being led divinely led or am i not being divinely led if you're not being divinely led he's here to lead you if you're willing to give yourself over to him amen and if he is leading you you should rejoice hallelujah now because you've got to ask the question what motivated the scribes and pharisees the religious world the churches of jesus day what motivated them to reject christ it wasn't it wasn't the spirit of god it wasn't but yet they could claim remember because i said this walking according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year that that is not a just an atheist you know atheist spirit or some other religion you know that's where it comes in among the true amen it says the same things it uses the same scripture you know you take the scribes and pharisees they believe the messiah was coming they believed they said we have we are moses disciple we believe what moses said you know and and that so they believed and then they even sent people down to john when he was baptizing are you the christ because they are under expectation that he was going to come and they even thought he's going to come but then when he came they didn't accept him they rejected him but then you take the woman at the well we know where messiah comes he'll do these things so they both had the same scripture but one was being divinely led to become one with that messiah and the other group was rejecting him so you know there was a religion you know it was you know it was so close it was close because they both said the same thing they both claimed to believe the same thing but when the word made was made flesh among them that really was the dividing line are these people being later are these people being led by god and then we can see this in first kings chapter 22 that's why this because satan is a religious being he wants to be worshiped he said i will ascend above the you know i will you know i will ascend i'll be like the most highest isn't isaiah well the most highest god in other words i'll be worshipped as god and paul speaks about in second thessalonians that he that he'll be in the temple of god showing himself that he is god worshipped and that's his ambition so it's a it's a it's in religious nature above all things and then we can see this we can see this in in first kings chapter 22 we have the story of ahab he he goes to the king of judah which is jehoshaphat and he says let's go take ramoff gilead back from the back from syria and so that used to be a part of israel but the syrians had taken it over so there so it was it was it was their land they had a right to reclaim it so their their ambition was right you could unders you know yeah i'm sure he could agree their ambition was right their cause seemed right but there was something very lacking in their understanding and that was that elijah had prophesied just the chapter before he says the dogs will lick ahab's blood so there's a prophecy he'd already come out that ahab had to die and the dogs lick his blood and so that had to be fulfilled but then if we go down into that scene and to save time we won't read it but but go away and read first kings uh 21 and 22 you know ahab had 400 hebrew prophets and and they consulted them because jehovah you know you know jehoshaphat said well shouldn't we consult god first you know shouldn't we and then and then so ahab said well i've got 400 hebrew prophets these aren't these aren't prophets of baal they're hebrew prophets and then they all said with one accord go up for the lands yours go up you know they they prophesied and they had one he made two horns of vine said by this you'll push the syrians out of the land now that sounds pretty good because there's 400 people saying the same thing and how many times how many times have you ever heard someone say you know you got something on your heart and then someone comes along and basically says what you're thinking about should i do this is this right someone says and they say that's a confirmation from god is it amen sometimes it is sometimes it's not amen i want you to think deep i want you to think real deep this morning and then so here's 400 prophets saying let's go up and take the land and then jehoshaphat says well isn't there one more isn't there one more prophet he had a bit more spiritual bone than ahab and then ahab said there is one more micah but i hate him because he always prophesies against me and then says jehoshaphat says don't let the king say so let's go get him and then so some of them go and get micah he says you say what they said and then and then we'll have fellowship again and micah says i'll only say what god puts in my mouth amen now now if you bring it into modern times you'd say here's 400 and they're all saying the same thing with one heart and one accord and it's according to the word that we should take that it was a different season ahab's blood had to be licked by some dogs he had to die and then so micah said i'll only say what god told me to say and then the next day he comes out and then micah says i see israel scattered without a shepherd and then the chief one of the 400 prophets that made the horns he smacks him in the mouth and says when did the spirit of god come out of me and go on to you he says yeah and then he said he said i saw i saw in heaven there's a conference in heaven see now i was going beyond just what you see going up into the eternal realm and then and god was having a conference saying how are we going to cause ahab to come into battle to die how we're going to get the word to be fulfilled and then a lying spirit comes out of hell and says let me get in those hebrew prophets and then god gave him consent so these 400 they were inspired they were anointed they were all with one accord but yet they were anointed by the wrong spirit but they could say at that moment we are divinely led we're being led by god and then you know and then you read the rest of the story that go into battle and before that ahab says take micah put him in the yo yo in the prison feed in the bread of sorrow in the water of sorrow and micah says if you come back at all god hasn't spoken to me and ahab dies in the battle of dogs lick his blood exactly as elijah said exactly according to the word that came through elijah so before micah has that vision of heaven and what was going on you'd say which one was divinely led amen see you got to know you you must know just because someone comes to you and says god told me this you should do this you got to have a witness in your heart if that's what god is telling you to do amen and then you've got to take it back to the scripture to say is this god's plan for my life is this really what god wants me to do remember they were hebrew prophets they were they were believers they wanted to see the land be reclaimed it was part of their inheritance that the devil had but they were anointed by the wrong spirit they didn't even know it amen because they didn't take their vision or their inspiration they didn't take it back to the word of what elijah had just said now divine leadership must be according to god's word ultimately how do you know you're led by god you've got to take it back to the scripture and then it must be so it must be according to god's word and it must be according to god's way and we can see this in 2nd samuel chapter 6 where david david wanted to bring the ark of the covenant into his city and what happened was he was trying to so so so his motive was right because where the ark was where the prince of god was so his motive was right he wanted he wanted god and among the people so his motive was right he was anointed king he was a he was a genuine man he was a genuine believer but the method that he tried to bring the arkhan was on a new cart instead of being on the shoulder of the levites that was god's provided way he put it on a new cart so the method that which he was he was bringing the ark into the city was wrong though his motive was right and he could say i feel divinely led amen i feel divinely led to do this but the way he was doing it was wrong amen and we understand you know the story you know you know the oxen stumbled and the ark was going to fall off the cart and a and a good man put his hand hold it to try and keep the word in its place and he was struck dead and they called uh holt david said stop this right now something's wrong a good man has lost his life out of my good intentions see that's why man's good intentions has to be according to the work david had good intentions but it was not according to the scripture and that's and it even says that they um you know you know they didn't just do this uh you know they did this with with great sincerity it says in second samuel 6 and 5 and and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of furwood even on harps and upholsteries and on timbrels and on and of cornets and on symbols so they were you know they really put everything they had because this was a special day that the ark was coming into the city but it wasn't according to god's plan it wasn't according to god's way because if you read that scripture david consulted with the captain you know and all the people and they said that's a wonderful idea let's let's bring the ark into the city but there was one person he didn't consult and that one person was the one he should have consulted which was nathan the prophet amen so he would have consulted the levites he would have consulted all the religious people and they all said let's do it david absolutely god's with you you're our anointed king we love you but then what happened a good man died but they would have said see i'm trying to bring this whole divine it's it it comes to a real thin point amen real real you know it's not it's not just a broad yo yo brush stroke you're the leader you're not lead well ultimately you are but you've got to come down to real hone it down is this god's provided way how how we're meant to do things or is this not and then so uzi died and brother brown preached a sermon trying to do god a service without it being his will many times when you put that sermon on the denominations because he says they made a new denominational cut which wasn't god's provided way to bring the word and it caused the death of a good man but then you've got to bring it down you've got to put it on your shoulders amen you got to you got to put that in your lap am i trying to do god or service without it being his will because it sounds good it may sound right it may make sense but is it god's way of doing things and so he failed to consult the prophet and the word lord always comes to the prophet amen he failed to consult the message of the hour bringing into our day's language he failed to consult the word and it caused a good man to die now they all claimed to be led by god and david was a genuine believer i mean he wasn't a make-believer he was a real he was a real believer but but but the way he wanted to do things was wrong and we have this for as many are led uh by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and this led in the greek it means to you know it means to drive it means to induce it means to bring you know you know bring forth to carry so something that's actually driving someone and he says he says in the um unconditional covenant he says so give us courage tonight give us faith give us give give leadership and let the holy spirit the real divine leader of the new testament of the holy ghost church may he lead us all the way into that perfect faith perfect love one for another make us lord so much in love that'd be hard to leave the building just tie our hearts together as one and may we be in one accord and may the same holy spirit that came on the day of pentecost to go forth and to bring forth the seed of abraham to the promise of god may he do his work tonight here in this building i say may do his work this morning here in this building before i ask it in jesus name amen amen you notice the levites had to carry the ark that was god's provided way so it was the because the ark represents the word of god so the word had to be carried upon the heart over the heart of a levite that was god's provided way and it couldn't have been just any you know you know it couldn't just be any anyone carrying the word now remember we are a nation of kings and priests under god yeah and you know you know the priests they didn't just come into the office haphazardly they had to be cleansed a certain way they had to dress a certain way i mean they had to be prepared for that event otherwise they would have been struck dead and so the same with us we can't carry the word we can't carry the word amen with a defiled heart amen you can't carry the word not being sanctified amen amen you can't carry the word not being cleansed by the power of god we all carry the word you understand that it takes a sincere dedicated heart that's been washed by the power of the blood i mean to really carry the word because many people have taken up the scripture and they may have the right ambition they may have the right motive they think but it's caused death upon good people amen and upon good families it's caused death because it hasn't been carried right i say the lord help us amen and that's the error we are carrying the word i'm not just talking about ministry every day we live a sermon every day we preach a sermon and if we if we bring it in a wrong way it'll cause death somewhere along the way amen so we have to we have to be prepared that's why that's why it's a faithful thing i mean to come into the presence of god it's a fearful thing it's a wonderful thing because we know he paid it all and we don't come in our own ability we come in his ability but god is not god is not mocked whatever you sow you'll reap and god is not an old granddad he'll he'll chastise us he'll do whatever he needs to do to get us into our position and he's not afraid to do whatever he needs to do because he's going to lead us he's determined he says i'm your father you're my children amen and whom a father loves he chastises he corrects not just to frustrate them not just to frustrate you he wants to guide you in the way that you should go god is not you know god is you know his his his his love is is supreme but his judgment correction is very severe amen this is you know our god is a severe you know his holiness he's a holy god i mean he loves us more than anything he you know he says about you know how much he loves us but he doesn't just let us get by with things david took bathsheba had had had her husband murdered and he was a righteous man and then apparently it was two years after the event here comes nathan the prophet and gives the parable one man had one sheep and another man had a whole big flock of sheep and then the man with the whole flock of sheep was having a feast he said i won't take one of my sheep i'll go steal this man's sheep and kill it and prepare it and feed the guests and then and then nathan asked david what should happen to this man and david said it's a wicked man he should just be dealt with and then nathan said you're the man you are that man so david must have thought two years down the road i just got by with this amen he didn't get by with it god waits sometimes then god deals with it amen but god allowed but the reason that and that was proof though of god's love for david because no adulterer will see heaven no fornicator will see heaven the scripture tells us i mean he said david had to put that right that was god's love now this is go tell my disciples all of the prophets of old not having any scripture to go as we have any divine promise of god only through the leadership of the holy ghost men of old as they were moved by the holy ghost wrote the word each one of them when they died they specified they wanted to be buried in palestine they did um they died out of palestine many of them but they wanted to be buried in palestine because god gave the first fruits of the resurrection out of palestine so they didn't have a bible you know moses wrote the first five books however many thousand odd years since adam i don't know how long it was but it was that was when the bible was put together before they didn't have a bible but yet they were under divine leadership what they're doing they were divinely led now i just want to go through abraham quickly yeah that's probably my foundation so i'm going to build on it now abraham i'm sure we all can agree abraham was divinely led by god amen he was divinely led by god and now that leadership started with a call he was called and i think genesis 12 get out of this country and go yo you know you're the land of your kindred and i'll show you a place and i'll make you a father of many nations there was a divine call that came through and through that call he became under the leadership of god and then so abraham had a divine call now but there's something so so so in order to be led there's things a leader must do okay so maybe i'm going to turn a corner here but i just trust it all works together now you know a leader must give a vision of of of what's the end goal in order to to lead correctly they must give a vision this is what we're aiming towards because if you don't have an end goal all the people you're trying to lead will just lose the vision you know you know they'll just you know you know there won't be a fervency there won't be desire to to to see it achieved so there must be an end result this is what we're aiming for and this is what god did when he first called abraham he says get the out of thy country and from my kindred and from my father's house into a land that i will show thee and i'll make thee a great nation i'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing so he's already given this is the end result you're going to receive a land that's not here and you're going to be a father of nations i'm going to make your name great so so he'd already told him this is the end goal and then so abraham dropped under that divine leadership and he began to walk according to what he was just told so and then as as god was as abraham was walking with god god revealed more now of of that call because you know you know when he's first called he says i'll give you a land but then afterwards he says this is the borders of the land and then and then he hones it even down more he says now sir now you and sarah are going to have the promise son not just out of you but now sarah's part of the promise you know and then so so so they so the promise we could say the the revelation that abraham received was honed down to more of a concrete thing and then so this was done that abraham would keep us focused because it was 25 years from when he was called to when he had isaac 25 years is a long time but god god kept him focused because he kept confirming his covenant with abraham over and over again and paul and so so he kept his focus and that call was a central drive of his life and we're talking about divine leadership who believes they are divinely led amen who believes they're divinely led then if you've been divinely called to do a certain thing keep it central whatever you do keep it central you say well what am i called to do you call to take a rapture in this hour you're called to become the very image of christ upon the earth a mature believer that we're called to do amen we're called to raise our children the way that they should go and let's not just bring them to church every sunday i should hear an amen from that amen amen because because what happens now if you raise them just out there and then now we have two hours every sunday morning well then actually you're raising them to go out there because that is the way that they've actually taught to go amen but their whole life is encompassing everything we do is because we love the lord and it's every facet of every you know every part of life is jesus christ then you'll raise them in the way that they should go amen you've got to keep that you've got to keep it central you've been divinely called and this is what you're meant to do you know if paul i don't know how many years down the road he stood in front of king agrippa he says whereupon oh king agrippa is not disobedient unto the heavenly vision and before that he relates the road to damascus experience he says i have not been disobedient to that one heavenly vision he was divinely called and he came under divine leadership and we i trust i trust you can see yourself in those stories i mean that we've been divinely called by a voice and it wasn't a voice from kentucky as a voice out of heaven i mean it wasn't just a man preaching but god came and confirmed that word multitudes of people came up on the platform this is your name this is where you're from this is your address this is why you're here is that true and you can hear them say it's true is that true it's true why because the spirit of truth was revealing what was going on and then point out to the audience you there you there this is what's wrong with you amen and every time it was true and god came in he says in quite a few sermons if i have said the truth and i are the true servant of god let him come forth now and prove that it's true and god did why says more than a man oh it's a bunch of shirts more than just a bunch of sermons it's christ being revealed it's divine leadership coming upon the earth once again i mean to lead a people into a rapture hallelujah so now a leader so so a leader keeps people focused he says this is our end goal amen this is what a leader does but then also a leader cultivates the people under them or under yeah amen that's right so a leader cultivates what is in the people now abraham abraham had to be cultivated amen yup hebrews 11 verse 17 it says by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and and that and he that had received the promise of offered up his only begotten son so this word try in the in the greek it means to test and and it's where we get the word assay from so he was actually assad abraham was being assayed abraham was being tested and this was all done because okay i'll take i'll take like you're a rock for example if you're looking for you know you know gold or any precious metal they they drill a big core sample out then they take that thing and then they take sections of it because they want to know what depth all the minerals are and they put it into a ball mill and they crush that rock into powder and they do certain chemical tests to see what is in that what is in that section of rock and that's where we get and that is being assayed that is assaying the rock where it once was a big column of rock and then it's crushed a powder and then it's examined what's in it and so when abraham and because you want to see what's in the rock amen so when abraham was being tried he was being assayed he was being ground down to powder amen every part of his life was being laid out it was being stripped down because god was examining now what's in you abraham i want to see what's in you hallelujah and then so now the same thing because remember you want to see if you've got people under you you want to see their qualities and you want to develop their qualities but not just that you want to help improve their weaknesses and see if they're good you'll get a certain way you want to you want to put them in that certain role that's leadership amen because you want to cultivate your staff or whoever's working for you and so but then you have so but then you have to examine them and you've got to see really what's in them amen and so abraham he was essayed he was ground down to powder he was examined in this way because god was willing to say what's in abraham what are the qualities there in abraham amen and then so you come along and god's put something in you because he wants to cultivate what's in you and abraham was being cultivated the whole time his walk was with god because he had to separate he believed god you know he had to separate from lord all these things had to be separated from him because what wasn't called abraham was called amen lot wasn't even part of the promise yeah it was it was abraham's promise not lot's promise and then so all the separation had to be taken place but then finally when the greatest test came here's the promise now now now kill that promise amen are you willing the thing you've been praying for are you willing to give it up are you willing to give it up to follow me i've been praying about this for so long are you going to give it up you received it now now now give it back and so now it was at that crucial time he was being assayed and this was done this was done to see now what was in abraham and you have to be able to put yourself in that those same shoes he was a man that was divinely led but now he was a man that was being pulled apart and god was examining him is there is there faith in there what is in him is it gold is it false gold is it make-believe is it faith amen is it his ambition or is it my word in him answer he was all laid out like that when he was tried and we know the end of the story he didn't he didn't he was gonna kill isaac but the angel said stop but he was going to do it because he believed that if god his body was dead sarah was all dried up you know abraham had sure he had hagar but it came down the time when they were both made yangi and they still couldn't have the child because they're still dead in their bodies even though they are turned young again and then so so he he knew if i was dead and i received one ass from the dead if i kill him he'll come back to life again god will raise him up amen amen so so he knew that that would happen so we are here divine leadership now that will you will be tried you will be essayed amen amen and the reason remember the reason essay like rock you don't want all the rock you just won the gold and the gold maybe maybe this much gold i don't know out of tons of rock amen and it's the same thing with us there may be tons of rock that god has to move to get the gold that's in you out amen if you're being crushed god's essaying you because he knows he knew what was in abraham he wanted to prove it you know some geologist can look at a mountain range this is what's in this rock but i'd have to say prove it to me okay i'll show you and they you know and they're mine this is how much he was like brother ian senior he said you know they could calculate the amount of gold up in peru used to be you know precious meals they could just look at it and you know examine it say this is how much is in there they hadn't mind anything yet they just took some samples and they found it it's just like god now god can look in you and he knows what he wants to see developed he wants your humanity to be get out of the way just like what we just read there to be carnally minded as death to be spiritually monitored as life because if you're calmly minded you're not being led by god i mean you're being led by your own self amen and your own self won't get you where you need to go amen but if you're spiritually minded then god will lead you the right way amen amen so he was essayed and so we are essayed because that's divine leadership is to not only lead you because remember we're not this is not some you know we're in 2016. this could be the last year we're here i probably said that last year but i'll say it again this year and this is not a story of the boy who cried wolf or maybe it is but i trust you still believe the boy amen where's the promise of a body change this could be the last year we're here but we don't want to just take it haphazardly we don't just want to say well it's another year and you know because if we're divinely led then we have a goal as i said but then what are we doing what are we doing about that goal the scripture tells us proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision that people perish where there is no vision but they could say well we have the bible but if you have no version what the bible is producing then the people will perish yeah and so we're to think what are we what are we wanting to achieve yeah if we're divinely led there's a specific thing that we're to achieve yep because it you know it's not just having church on a sunday or a wednesday or whenever day we may gather that is that is not why we're divinely called you know what do you want out of this year what do you want out of when we gather what do you you know what do you want to do what do you feel led to do you take it back into the scripture why do we you know you know i've been thinking about this because we you know we're at a time where life can't just go on that's right you understand that life can't i do not believe i'll have grandchildren or even children amen amen not not you know because i don't believe we have that much time left i do not believe it for a second and so we can't just keep having church and then have church and then have camp and then have camp and have watched you know life is not just going to continue on that way but then brother abram tells us he says it's when he says any any builders can can can put down a wall put down a stone wall but it takes a master mason to actually lay the corner right to turn the corner and then he said now when jesus came and john the baptist was coming i mean mean came israel was turning a corner they are going from law to grace they're going from the blood of a lamb or a bull or a goat to the blood of thee lamb amen they'll go from god above them to god with them than god in them they're turning a tremendous corner i'm sure you can agree and it took divine leadership now to lead the people around that corner and and so so they turned a corner and then now we're at the end of the church ages where god is turning a corner again amen because we're under expectation for a change in the body and we can say we have that expectation because the scripture identifies where we are so there's a change in the body there's a rapture then the tribulation and there's the millennium that's a corner i'm sure you can agree that's a big corner but it's always at the corner that the people stumble amen israel stumbled when jesus was there he said if he can't believe me believe the works that i do for they that they are they that testify of me amen so they couldn't they stumbled at him they stumbled here comes the lamb of god take away the sin of the world even john himself identified himself in the scripture he he was asked who are you i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the lord he quoted the scripture for them this is me and they stumbled they stumbled at john yeah now we are not here to stumble and fall yeah because even even even brother braham says the rapture will go because there's a secret i come as a thief in the night to catch the bride away so people will still be having church people still think they're getting saved you know they'll still have meetings now what are we going to do for the year in our services how are we going to reach this country pray for you or whatever they're still going to christian but the corner has been turned and they missed the turning of the corner yeah because they weren't under the divine leadership that came to steer them through that corner amen so we are in the process you know we have turned a corner we have turned a corner this age has turned a corner and not only has the age turner well how do you say the ages turn the corner because the prophet's come the word's been opened christ has been kicked out of his church revelations three behold i stand the door and knock if any man will open the door there's not just a man's heart he's talking about the age itself he's standing on the outside of the christian church that's a big corner term once he was in there now he's been kicked out and so you know so this has happened but then there's you know but then where we are now from there down to here we have turned a corner where once it wasn't once it was a time like the book of judges every man did what was right in his own eyes amen well i believe the message says this i believe the bible the message say this this is and everyone did what was right in their own eyes there's still some around but the majority that was a time of judges but now there's a difference now where people are actually coming under the divine leadership of the word himself why'd they have a time of judges because they led they followed what was right in their own eyes they had the word amen the angel of the lord was still among them hey he visited gideon he visited other ones in the in the book of judges god was still there but they were doing they're doing well i believe this is how it should be done instead of going back to the word and saying lord is this right those days are over amen those days are over they could say well we believe we're divinely led because we have look i can quote scripture this is what it says i'm in the land i'm a real believer but they are doing what was right in their own eyes amen that that phrase is repeated in the book of judges over and over again but it came to an end amen when the king came upon the throne you say well what about the king now he's got to be king in here before he's king in the millennium and if he's king in here you won't want to do what's right in your own eyes amen you won't want to do it but if he's not king in here you know it's like brother joseph brought out in the convention of a care carry he yeah he brought out a quote how do you know you're redeemed you no longer want your own will that's how you know you're redeemed you don't want your own will so how do you know you're under divine leadership you don't want your own will amen but if you want your own will then you that must die i mean that must lie no bones about it you can't be led by two things at once you can't please two masters jesus said you can't serve god and mammon amen you cannot serve both you can be religious and you know you can be you can you can serve the world and be religious amen yeah but that doesn't mean you're under divine leadership so now maybe i just wind it up so here's yo here's that question what are you being led by it doesn't matter what situation you're going into life that's irrelevant what are you being led by because the greatest danger david david fell at the end of his life numbered the people you know no i mean i mean even before that bathsheba you know saw bathsheba because instead of out there fighting with the rest of the believers to to take the land he sat back in his palace he began to lose the vision what he was called to do yeah and people can can come down and they can get comfortable in their walk and they can say no i just know everything everything's just going to be rosy and that's where the danger comes in yeah that's right god told moses told the people when you come into the land and you're blessed and you have all these things then you will be careful because you'll forget the lord in that time amen and they did they went from divine leadership now they've just been led by their own selves what about you yeah you know yo i put this on my lap i don't just want to come here and have church and just continue on and here we are and this is what we do and you know i must go beyond that amen we're not here forever there's a singleness of heart now i i've been called under a rapture call this is a bright caller's gone out hallelujah amen because if you've you know if that is anchored in your heart if that is anchored in your heart you'll be led like abraham was led you'll be led paul paul said i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision now it's not the danger is never when the call comes you know the challenge can be to keep the vision that has been given amen because during the walk we can lose our vision sometimes and people look yo because people get motivated they can they can start for the kingdom they can get all enthused about it but then after a while they begin to taper off and cool down because they begin to lose the fervency of the vision amen let's not go that way amen you gotta i trust when you get up in the morning you think this is our goal honey this is this is why we're raising our kids a certain way not because we want to be different it's not about trying to be different it's about the family circle will be unbroken on that day and we know it's god's grace that gets us there but we're going to do everything in our power amen everything in our power to create the right ass you know you know create the right atmosphere to do the right kind of things amen that something will happen in our children in us they'll take us into a higher walk with god amen and that's not being some some fanatic paul you know all the believers they are fully persuaded they sold out they were fully persuaded they came under divine leadership and god led them every step of the way and the world thought they were mad but who cares who cares what the world thinks amen so i trust this coming year we'll do things a little differently amen and my prayer for me this year is i don't want to be led by myself i don't want to be led by how i feel about things or you know what i think in it oh it seems to be working therefore let's just do it that way no israel thought things were working and it was going downhill we want to do things according to the scripture because if you stand on god's word he'll stand by you amen amen if you don't stand on god's word he's not obligated to do anything for you amen so maybe let's just let's just bow heads in the wood of prayer family want to be remembered or just raise your hands i'm going to raise raise both my hands don't be afraid to trust them don't be afraid to trust them dear lord jesus father i pray you just take this chopped up message father may you just buy your holy ghost put it all straight lord father may recognize that it takes more than just being enthused about something it takes
