amen the god of Samson still lives amen amen God bless you thanks brother Josh appreciate the song service thank you musicians amen praise the Lord hallelujah welcome to this prayer evening tonight amen God bless you all great to have everyone here amen we're just going to go turn to um we're just going to read a couple of places we're going to start in um Isaiah 53 and: 1 down to verse 7 amen you know there's a uh there's a reason why we stand for the reading of the word in a service just like a you know in a courtroom the judge comes in you know everyone stands to attention or the king or something and we believe when we read the word there's the Lord coming in amen so more than tradition but you we want to respect the word and love him more than ever before amen amen so let's um let's read this here Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for those who believe his report the arm of the Lord has been revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he has despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we're healed we all sorry all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before Herer is dumbb so he openeth not his mouth amen then we're going to go to Zechariah there's just one verse here I'd like to read in Zechariah 12 and and verse 10 and uh just as you're turning there I'd just like to I just want to speak about the value of a scar amen we have a time of prayer but this is where I'm going with this amen so the value of a scar some scars actually all scars are actually Priceless if God can get a hold of them and use them for his glory amen so Zechariah 12 and10 and it says here and I'll pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn amen so let's just uh go to the Lord in prayer tonight amen as as we've read his word gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can sing you are a miracle working God God how true that is Lord Jesus and we're so thankful Lord you have not stopped Lord doing the miraculous oh God lord saving the Lost Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils Lord manifesting your word we're so thankful that we can bow our heads in your presence and Lord give you glory and praise we thank you that we can gather this night we ask that you would walk among us touch our hearts like only you can and dear God we greatly desire that when when when we're all praying at the end of the service it wouldn't be us praying but Lord may you pray through US Lord may your mind be spoken father may you have your way Lord we just want to submit ourselves under your Mighty hand and I pray you'd forgive us of all of our sins and our trespasses cover us in your blood Lord wash us clean Lord dear God as we approach your great presence tonight we pray You' just have mer you you'd be merciful to us and have your way in this service and also those who who couldn't make it tonight be their portion Lord remember them Father be with them we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight as we just have a have a little bit of time here so I want to speak about the value of a scar now scars have incredible value because of the story behind them some people have incredible scars I'm talking about even you know natural if you could look at you know many many people have been through a lot of great experiences some are some are um you know greatly troubling some are incredible things where life and death was hanging hanging in the balance but every scar has value now we would look as as you know we would read here in Isaiah chapter 53 about the you know about the scars or the wounds that our lord Jesus would receive and you know they are the greatest scars that ever come upon a human being is when our lord Jesus died on Calvary for you and I he purchased our Redemption and it was a complete Redemption that he that he purchased there he didn't have to pay any more he was wounded more than any other man and you know it was incredible incredible event that took place there but you know isn't it isn't it so amazing that you know we can look at things in life that affect us because you know we're all going to we all have a testimony yeah and I believe Heaven's going to be a testimony time about what he's done in our lives but you know he needs the Holy Ghost I was hearing brother Braham I can't remember if it was on in the indictment or you message but you know brother Braham was saying the Lord needs people to work through he needs he needs people to surrender themselves to him that he can work through their lives now scars can can can um scars can work two ways and it's up to you they can either make you live in the past and be hurtful and question and wonder and be bitter and resentful and all those things or it can give God glory yes my Lord and God can use them you know I was thinking I was trying to get my I don't know if I can really ever get my head around it but God just decided to allow scars to come into human beings and pain we know because of sin there's you know we're under the effects of not in in terms of being under the Dominion of unbelief but we're born in these bodies we have these human spirits that can be damaged and hurt and pain can come into our spirit or our body can affect us physically or emotionally different things but you know everything that happens to a Believer happens for a reason and God In His Infinite Mercy or wisdom decided this is how he's going to he's going to allow things to come into life that then he that that that we can give them to him and then he can use them for his glory you know just like with this um speaking here in John chapter 9 here there was this man that was born blind and disciples were asking is it was it his sin his parents sin or what's the reason you know that that he was born this way and Jesus said no you actually got the wrong end of the stick it's that the works of God would be manifest in him so this so this inment this impediment this problem that you know no doubt you know he would have just sat there he couldn't he couldn't walk normally like any other child he couldn't behave and you know he couldn't be like any of the other boys playing whatever games they played in that day cuz he was blind but you see and you know he did sit in Duck says we know but there came a point where the where the Lord himself came and touched him and healed him and he wasn't a blind man no more and then he walked around with a testimony because after this the scribes and Pharisees got a hold of him he came in front of them and they wanted to know what who did this and what happened and you know and this man would testify in front of them all I know is I was blind but now I see because they trying to say this man's a sinner and give God the praise and all these things and even his own parents wouldn't testify on his behalf yeah but he said all I know as I was blind but now I see am mean so what he began to testify of the glory of God in his life he wasn't no longer standing there saying oh all those Wasted Years all those things I missed out on all those things I could have experienced he didn't look at those things anymore because he was blind but now he could see so now here was a man who had never no one else had a testimony like him amen cuz he was born blind right so now he had a testimony the very God of creation made new eyes in me amen caused me to see Hallelujah so it became a glorious thing it was it was a scar but it wasn't a negative scar it was a very positive Scar and you can look at all the Believers down through the Bible many of them came from damaged homes many of them came from troubled lives many of them were broken people but God came and used them for his glory even many of them had no idea what they were living out you take Ruth or Rahab or Tamar or you know many of the Great Believers of Faith down through the Bible they didn't know they're living out God's Plan of Redemption as a shadow they didn't know they representing a bride of Christ in the end time they were just living through life and they had great trouble and pain and hurt but God used them to display himself amen so now how much more you and I that we can look back and say thank you lordu I was wounded but now I'm Healed I was broken and now I'm mended now if you're still wrestling with your past give it to God Amen let him bring healing into your life let him bring healing let him bring stability let him bring peace you say I don't know why I Was Born This Way well God allowed you to be born a certain way cuz he wanted to display his glory in your life am mean just like this man who is who was born blind because you see we're going to realize that we don't have a say how God wants to fulfill his word in our life Christine and I were talking about you know Elijah here and you know you know how God told them after he went before Ahab and Jezebel saying there won't be any rain or due to I call for it and then God tells him I'm going to send unclean Birds scavengers to feed you they're going to be the delivery they're going to be the drones amen that are going to bring your contactless meals to you while you s sit by this Brook now if if if Elijah wasn't surrendered to God he'd said God you're wrong these are scavenger Birds they're unclean Birds I'm a holy prophet I'm dedicated to you you know this is a wrong way I don't agree with what you're doing God this is wrong but he wasn't like that cuz surrendered to God Amen he believed that God would sustain him if God said I'm sending you Ravens with food Ravens came with food hallelujah amen then they came a time when the brook got lower and lower and lower and lower and then God said go to a foreign land go out of Israel and if he wasn't happy about it he was say God you're wrong you're sending me out of my inheritance God this is not right see we want God to be a miracle right we want to see him be a Mir we want to see his Supernatural hand but we've got to let him do it how he wants to do it am amen we want to see God needs a people to give themselves to him that he can be the miracle am but how he does it is his prerogative that's right amen so so so Elijah there's no account of him saying here in this account or when he sent to the um widow woman God you're wrong why does it have to be this way God this is not fair God I'm not happy with what you're doing God are you really in control God now God said go by the Brook jerith and I'll bring you Ravens or feed you praise the Lord here I go amen finds a comfy spot in the shade no doubt breakfast lunch dinner I don't know how many times I eat in those days but he got fed yeah and he drank from the brook and maybe the brook got low and low maybe had to dig a hole to get some water and all these things but then the same voice said to him now go to what the zidonians or wherever and there's a widow woman there she'll sustain the okay Lord here I go amen oh but why Lord no he didn't ask why he said praise God Lord I'm on my way I'm walking with the pillar of fire am amen and it's got to be the same way with you and I see God's God thank you he's he he's the professional worker outou of of paths and ordering paths and he knows the future and he knows he knows what he wants to get out of you but are we surrender that he will whatever he wants to display he's going to display it because I doubt very much you know you know if if if we were conscience you know conscious we we knew what we were signing up for when we're in glory I doubt any any of us would have said pick me Lord for that job do you think Ruth wanted to be Ruth you know do you think do you think actually her her mom-in-law would have said yes I'll be that one go now I'm just talking about the natural things she had to go through now if if if the supernatural side all those things were hidden you know you're going to go through hardship you're going to lose your husband you're going to lose your sons you're going to be in Moab you're going to come back with nothing you're going to be so bitter in your spirit that say call me Mara now right Moses Moses you're going to be 40 years in Pharaoh's Palace 40 years on the back side of the desert you're not going to see the promised land because of your own Humanity but oh but Angels when you die are going to pack you there so it's okay but you know all these things that have to endure but yet I believe being Believers would say yes Lord amen amen amen I believe as Believers I'm not coning what I just said but I'm I believe as Believers say yes Lord I'll go through and the reason I can say that is because even now when we don't understand why and we're not sure what's really going on all we know is God's leading this is not IDE deal it is IDE deal we're in the will of God that's it praise the Lord Jonah was in the will of God in a whale's belly yeah whether you like it or not because because the nites worshiped a whale god what happened their Prophet stepped out of their God and began preaching to them yeah right hallelujah amen as as like brother Braham said many people say Jonah was backler but he always took up for Jonah right CU he's actually walking in the will of God you say well he ran from the prince of God God ordained all those things y That's right to allow him to get there okay so you know we got to we got to really say Lord whatever you want for my life give me Grace to walk in it Lord and and be happy in the same token we're on our way to heaven shouting Victory amen but see we've got to be see Elijah didn't work out what God was going to do he just followed God it's got to be the same thing with you and I amen see Moses would I mean Michelangelo would spend I don't know how many years sculpting this this is a tomb of a on a tomb of a pope and he was um he was commissioned to to make a make a statue of Moses out of a solid piece of marble I can't remember the height of this thing but it was a solid slab of marble now Michelangelo and his mind knew what Moses would look like he didn't have any paint he didn't have a picture of Moses but he just the inspiration was in him and he started chisling away and I don't know how he did it but you know even apparently even the details of the muscles on Moses forarm everything how his fingers are and and what it makes the that's all accurate that's perfect you see and he spent years molding and shaping Moses out of a piece of stone now he came to a point where where the inspiration that was in his heart was now made material in front of him and he got so excited he took up his hammer and he smoked it on the knee you can't see it oh it's about here in the picture um there's this there's this crack cuz he got so inspired he picked up the hammer and he Cried Out speak and he struck it expecting the thing to speak back to him because what was in his heart was so real it was so material in front of him and brother bam saw a replica of this on in the Forest loone Cemetery in uh in America and he said to him it was the it was the CU a lot of people say well the mark on the knee is now a floor it's a floored sculpture but the prophet saw that floor and he said to to me to him rather that made it the Masterpiece it wasn't the skill of the sculpture it was the fact that the inspiration in the artist became so real that he smote the image amen and it's the same thing now with you know with you and I even just take back to the Lord Jesus see God was remolding he was sculpting the perfect man down through the prophets down through and if you look at the lives of the Believers of the Old Testament they were rugged lives they weren't a flowery bed of EAS They Carried a lot of scars amen now a scar is a testimony a scar is actually a victory if it's given to the Lord amen just like how Joshua would would um I know I'm running out of time but to say very quickly you know Joshua assigned six Cities of Refuge in the Old Testament in the in the promised land many of them were were strongholds of the enemy they were they were cities of the amalekites and different ones but you see Joshua ordained these cities and Caleb took one of them and it became a City of Refuge so so someone who who who did a crime that you know maybe they killed someone by accident or something happened before before the relatives of the one dead or whatever could could avenge against their relative this person could run to the City of Refuge and be safe he could let off the pressure could he g into the City of Refuge so before Israel before Joshua Israelites came into the promised land they were strongholds of the enemy but then when Israel came in they became Cities of Refuge and so it's the same thing with scars in our life they can be a stronghold of the enemy they can be a complex of pain something of the past it can be actually something just like you know you know some people you can say certain things it's like trigger words and it's got something in their past you know nothing about causes this thing just to explode what is that a stronghold as the Bible says pulling down the strongholds of the enemy don't give place to the enemy right but then that same thing can be turned around when God steps in and it can be a City of Refuge in terms of the fact that you can step into someone's burden and pray for them far more than someone else uh who could if they' never been in that kind of experience even as brother Brown would say this about his about his little little daughter Sharon Rose where you know she was um dying in so much pain I'm not going to read it but just to you know save time you know she she she was D she she got in so much pain as a baby her eyes crossed and then he says here I could never stand to see a crosseyed child from then I've never seen one past the platform but that was healed amen is that right I've seen 400 and something crossy children healed in 6 months wow why is that because he saw his daughter dying in that Agony now he had a choice he could have become bitter he could have become resentful he could have said why me and this is wrong and that's not fair and God you know this is wrong and I'm mad at you and I'm I'm going to turn my back on you because of what you've allowed happen in my life all these things he had that choice he was a man of like passions like you and I but he gave it to the Lord and the Lord now could use it that when he saw a cross-eyed Child come across a platform his mind went back to when he saw his little little daughter there and he entered into the need and prayed and look at the results my but I doubt very much those parents that had those children knew the suffering and the pain that caused that hurt that scar in his life for that to happen hallelujah amen so everything works together for our good Romans 8:28 it actually all works together for our good but we're going to let the Lord use it for our good amen blessed because it's the wounding it's the scar there's there's Great Value in the scar so as he said about the Michelangelo here he said he said the the the mark on the knee makes it the Masterpiece amen and it's the same thing with our lord Jesus sure he made that man see he did incredible Miracles he did rais Lazarus from the grave did incredible things but what made him the the Masterpiece is that his wounds brought salvation amen his wounds brought healing his wounds bring Deliverance amen how many times if we can look into the Old Testament and and we draw strength from believer's scars amen we can draw strength from Caleb he was a slave in Egypt but he came out of it he overcame his past he said no God's able to give me the land and to sure doesn't matter where you come out of when God ignites the seed in your soul by his word all those things don't matter you go on to the promised land you're going to take your inheritance amen you see Rahab she you know brother Braham says that it was actually her parents put her into prostitution but then when the when the spies came away the the the token came on display of that Scarlet rope I mean we can draw strength from that you say here's a woman who came out of a broken life a broken home a broken upbringing but Grace came into her life amen and salvation came into her home so if she can come out of that mess amen I'm I'm going to be okay amen Hallelujah you look at Tamar you look at Ruth you look at Rahab you know you can take even David and the credible things he went through to get on the throne if David can go through those things my God is the same as David's God Amen we can we can make it through amen Noah and all the trouble he had and you know you can just look at all the all of them y amen we draw strength in them don't don't we the woman at the well we draw strength from her testimony Peter James and John and and Paul we draw strength from them do we not amen why CU there's value in their scars amen they're powerful they have they have impact thousands of years after they were alive those scars are still speaking I mean those star scars still have an impact I trust they have have impacted you I mean you read the Bible you read about Isaiah and different ones the things they had to endure you say Thank You Lord does it not encourage you does it not give you strength does it not give you courage amen why because there's value in their scars there's value in their testimony amen that's same thing now especially with our lord Jesus because his scars brought eternal life his wounding brought eternal life amen he was mared more than any man and what kind of strength do we draw out of those scars amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost I me we're going to draw the Rapture out of the valley of those scars am because he purchased the translation of our bodies that day on Calvary amen we can draw healing amen we can draw prodal coming home we can draw the dead raising we can draw all the gifts in the church amen we can draw amen a placed her position in the word amen we can draw all things because of those scars so that depends what you value amen so you can value either negative things happening or you can give it to the Lord and it and then you can really value it thank you Lord you want to use my past you want to use my upbringing you say I've always been been an oddball well then you can understand other odd balls amen yeah praise God you know you could there should be nothing in our past that should Hold Us Down amen if it's if it's not given to the Lord it'll hold you down but if you've really given it to the Lord he said I don't understand Lord but I don't need to understand you'll make it all clear when we get to that other side I mean you'll make me understand it you'll help me you know that way but in the meantime Lord use it for your glory amen the Lord hallelujah because you see now God wants to use he wants to use our scars for a testimony Our Testimony is a testimony amen and as you see it's those who have scars are those who are going to ride in his Chariot yeah now I'm talking about testimony scars or just I mean they're all a testimony right amen you can take the day you born your for even your fourbears getting here is a testimony a lot of our forbears went through Wars went through plagues went through trouble they're here I mean we're here aren't we travel overseas on ships all kind of dangers whatever more we're here God preserve them to bring you here praise the Lord amen so but you see now brother BR would tell a story in conference he's speaking about uh Caesar and Caesar wants to have a Triumph wants to have a a Triumph as a victory parade and so he goes down because because he's going to have his great Jubilee and and he wants one soldier to ride in his Chariot there's only room for one so if you think now here's the opportunity to ride in the Chariot of Caesar not just anyone Caesar like Julius Caesar or one of them right so now all of the soldiers they get their you know armor shining and and and and their plumes pluming and you know all those things I've seen um what is it a trentham there there were the giras there or someone you know the burmes soldiers right and they have their hats and boxes probably fish would know more about this than me but you know they have their hats that are straight actually in like a press to keep it perfectly straight this would have been like this but on steroids because you're going to ride with Caesar okay so the Polish is polished and the you know everything shining and all these things and he's looking he's looking and all the Warriors trim their plumes I'm halfway through this here and polish their Shields and their helmets getting ready to pass by Caesar and to review to see who he would choose to ride with him in this great parade and said all of his Warriors walking perfectly straightly walked by and stood with their salute and said all along Caesar looked at each one as he came by said after a while a little bitty old Soldier crippled up his arm scar all over his face everything walked by and he felt ashamed of himself amen this is see you see a Believer is not proud a Believer doesn't think they deserve anything amen amen amen we don't we don't earn it we don't deserve it but we accept it right and we're thankful amen so here's this little bitty guy all scarred up walking by he felt ashamed of himself he probably thought man my Shield's not as shiny as that one look at my swords bent I got dents in my helmet all these campaigns have been through you know he can't even get half a decent shine on his armor he's probably you know can't even walk straight because of wounds and things he's had in his body and you know he feels ashamed of himself thinking I don't measure up to these other soldiers and he bowed him uh and he kind of bowed his head and started away and Cesar said wait a minute wait a minute there come back here the little soldier walked up and fell on his knees he said yes great emperor said where did you get them scar what you all scarred up about he said I got them in the battlefield fighting for my Emperor he said you sit up here by me you earn the ride he says I don't care whether I'm a DD PhD or a double LD I want some scars to show I've been in the battle amen I want some testimonies you shall been serving my Lord I mean because you think about a soldier serving Caesar as an extension of Caesar performing SE Caesar's will we're going to go invade Britain well we're going to Britain we're going to fight the Cs or whoever's over there we're going we're going here an extension of his will amen and that's what the Bride of Jesus Christ is it's not our will but thy will be done amen so every scar this this Soldier got was because of account of of the orders of Caesar amen but he didn't think he was worth anything to ride in his Chariot and I think that's kind of how we feel don't you think about it friends I mean because we got a chariot you know brother R said when that Chariot came to get Elijah there were chariots hitch to every Bush and and and tree around where Elijah was but it's your chariot there was one for Elijah but there's one waiting for you amen so one day we're going to take a chariot ride amen it's going to be glorious amen but what's going to happen it's going to be scarred veterans that are going to take a chariot ride now we're going to realize that a scar is because of a campaign it's because of a battle no not every one of us are preachers not every one of us are out in the front that doesn't mean we're not going to have scars testimonies right because remember it's the hidden parts of the body that are most valuable Lord amen you ever see someone's heart out of their chest there's a problem it's got to be in the chest beating right your lungs your vital organs you don't see vital organs on the outside of the body right but they are the most important ones the ones you never think about until you're sick something's damaged there maybe you got an infection in your lungs something's wrong with your heart I don't know but something you never normally think about but when that thing is is injured the whole body's affected more than maybe something on the outside amen if you break a you break a little bone in your little toe you know about it oh yeah that Bone's fine you don't even know you you forget your toes there half the time right and it can be like parts of the body of Christ the hidden parts are the most valuable ones amen so never think that no one's important everyone's important brother Ram says the success of his meetings is because of people praying with their names ever in lights or posters no but the success of his meetings was people praying now I just want to finish with this cuz this this scripture I'm kind of seu but this scripture I I read it a few days ago it's just been on my mind so much you know it's amazing when when Paul would list Believers at the end of Epistles and you know they weren't the only Believers around but for some reason the Lord inspired him to to to speak of of of certain Believers and this and this brother uh ephus however you say it who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God wouldn't that be an incredible testimony to have oh yeah wouldn't that be an incredible you know if if if if God could write two verses about you wouldn't that be the desire that you that that that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God wouldn't that be what you would want to be known for why you're part of the body why you encourage one another why you pray for one another why you exalt and share scriptures and songs and testimonies and and you and messages the whole thrust of your life is that the rest of the body of Christ would stand perfect and complete in all the will of God isn't that powerful I think ephis is going to have a chariot ride amen I believe he's going to be one of the great Heroes of Faith was he known very much in his day well apart from this writing I doubt very much was he a minister there's no record of him being a minister was he a pastor evangelist Prophet teacher there's no record of that but the burden of his life is that the Saints would stand perfect and complete in all the will of godall amen and I pray to God that this becomes our desire amen that when we pray when we pray for one another when we you know we never go to God with a selfish motive when ever come to God with some kind of staty I'm better than next fell that's why I'm praying for them kind of thing no but our but our but our thrust of our prayer should be Lord may may my brother may my sister may they stand perfect may they stand in maturity amen stand in completeness not a baby tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine but they know in whom they have believed am me they walk with God no matter what's going on they're always rejoicing even in the trial God help me to be like that amen and and complete in all the will of God what is God's will his word amen not just fulfilling one part they're fulfilling the whole part amen I think this should be the thrust of our life amen amen you may not be a prayer Warrior but hey you can pray amen but you know it's so I doubt very much that that people would have known about him until this and maybe when he read this read this letter he thought Paul why did you have to put my name in there you know because it's like the soldier who felt as shame coming before Caesar he didn't March up say that's my that's my ride I just deserve it look at all mcars look at the battles have been through ceson let me tell you about the campaign you're in the back on your horse watching I in the front killing barbarians no see a real a real Christian walks in humility does not think they're anything amen they know God's everything all they care about is him living and I you know I believe ephis would have been that kind of a brother you know probably even embarrassed at his name's there why' you have to tell them about me like this and but you see this is how we should be yes so we're going to have a time of prayer tonight and if there's ever people that you know we're ordain to stand perfect and complete in all the will of God it's this end time bride it's you and I friends in this end time so let's um let's have the let's have the musicians we're just I was going to leave it there because it's 20 something past 8 we have a time of prayer amen but it's your I trust you can see the value of your scars where God wants to use your testimony to help others amen you can pray for them you can encourage them you can share where you've been and what God's brought you through amen all all your testimonies where you know God can help you amen amen that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God Amen so let's stand tonight let's sing that
