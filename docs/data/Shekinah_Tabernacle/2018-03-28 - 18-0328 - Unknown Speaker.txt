couldn't make it tonight be their portion and father we just come at the service into your hands and Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean Thank You musicians I mean good evening everyone amen happy birthday a man plays the Lord God bless you amen happy birthday hallelujah amen let's go to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 just as we're turning just a reminder we're going to have communion and foot washing this Friday at 7 p.m. here and then there's going to be the regular service on Sunday morning amen what if I'm to be alive Ephesians chapter 1 we we we read this on Sunday that's why I go a little bit further Ephesians 1 we're going to read verses 4 to 6 and then we're going to go to first Corinthians 13 he says as he has sorry as if one's everyone there they mean so Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved licious just read the next verse as well and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace amen and let's just go to 1st Corinthians chapter 13 when I read to 2 verses 12 and 12 and 13 just a bit of a bit of a context so first Corinthians 13 12 and 13 it is for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three the greatest of these is charity amen may the Lord have a blessing in his word you may you may have your seats tonight so I'd like to can continue where I left off kind of on on Sunday or maybe expand a few things I want to talk about the adoption of children or the placing of a child we are we are living in a in a wonderful season I was thinking I've been thinking about Easter and you know we want to talk about what Easter what whoa what he came to achieve when he died and he was buried in a rose again what was the achievement you know you know what was his purpose in doing that and we know that it was it was not only to wash us of our washes of our unbelief of our sins and but it was also to place us in a position in him and so this so the bride of Jesus Christ in this season I believe is manifesting the purpose of Calvary amen so the purpose of Calvary is that God would Redeemer people back to himself back to where they should have been in the beginning which is joint heirs with him Alleluia that they would be seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that they would be placed in the family of God where where their name on the chick was as good as the father's name because they had the mind of the Father they knew it's like a like if if you have a family business and and the father has maybe built the business up and he knows exactly how it all should go but then he has children and he wants those children to be trained and eventually when they come to age he can pass the business on to them or they can manifest his will I mean of what the business should be because he knows what they think about the business is what he thinks about the business amen so it's the same thing now when it comes to a placing of a people is that the is that the bride comes through the position where they know exactly what the will of God is and how to implement it upon the earth Alleluia amen so now but part of this really is knowing knowing as as Peters Paul said in first Corinthians 13 here that then shall I know even as also I am known and this is this age where you should know you you you know about yourself as God knows you and we know in the scripture where God thinks the thought is not just a nice you know a nice idea about someone who can change with time and you know change with emotion that's not God's thoughts when God thinks something that is it that is it and it's completeness I mean that's and it's fullness and it just has to be manifested upon the earth so when it says in Jeremiah that my thoughts towards your a peace I mean that you would receive an expected end there's not him just thinking are they lovely people I think nice things about you and it's going to be a peace and you'll have a nice you know expect it in no goddess thinking when he says at you that a sauce towards you are I know who you are and me I mean I I predestinated you to a specific position in me that you'd become joint heirs with me I mean that's my thoughts towards you being peace that you had come to unexpected end only that expected Enders ruling and reigning with him I mean that is sitting down and his throne as he sat down and his Father's throne Alleluia so now we have to come to a place now we understand that you know we have to come to a place where we go beyond just saying that we're sinners saved by grace we know we're sinners saved by grace but if you just keep saying well I'm just as soon as saved by grace you know it can produce it can produce a false humility and it actually produces some kind of slave mentality and seed of a victorious overcoming mentality I mean when someone knows that they're a son or daughter of the king it doesn't make them arrogant it doesn't make them proud it makes them humble but they know who they are I mean they're not pushovers by the devil they're not just pushed around by every spirit that would come along and honor in my hair believe they know who they are and who I mean not pushed her out magic going mention going to you know the rule family in England and trying to push maybe just say if William was the next in line just going on I'm pushing him off saying you're not good on here at this turn it's mine he would look at you and say get out of here boy I mean his the the Kings I mean the Queen's blood flows through my veins I mean I have the paperwork to prove I am in line for this throne because I know who I am hallelujah he won did he push rugger oh okay you can have it you know and we know he'll he'll stand for his rights that he believes he has it should be even more so by us we're not here doing here at some earthly throne that'll pass away we're here to overcome and sit in a heavenly throne hallelujah so we should know who we are and God wants us to know who we are a mint so we shouldn't just walk around say well we're just enough saved by grace we are but we don't stay there and then we grow we grow into what we meant to be we're not you know we shouldn't walk around with a false humility and a defeated attitude amen you know I'm not good I'm just a sinner that's what people say but God doesn't want us just to be sinners he wants to take us I mean places are now inheritance that we would know who we are I mean as it says in Ephesians 5 it said he would present himself that's it that's it husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself word that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing by the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish a glorious church hallelujah a glorious church not just a bunch of slaves that are still all praise the Lord and Here I am being beaten by some devil and you know I'm just as soon as saved by grace no the shackles are being thrown off I mean the one who was doing the tormenting is under the feet I mean it's been a revolution hallelujah that the rightful is take their position in the kingdom I mean that they're not being beaten down by the devil anymore and and these squatters brother Graham calls the devil a squatter he's squatting on our land hallelujah and he has no right to this place even though he tries to claim it I mean it comes to a point where the people come to recognize that the devil's just a squatter they take their god-given rights hallelujah they stand on their feet they take God at His Word hallelujah and enforcer restoration I was thinking you who should restoration of the pride tree brother Brahim gives a illustration in the beginning of that of that story where I mean I mean of that message where he talks about testimony of a brother who who drove to the tabernacle with his family you know to attend the meeting is a world apart somewhere there track got stolen and and there was a there was a car stealing gang there and there in Jeffersonville in Indiana and they would drive the cars to Indiana or the other the next state over the river whatever it is and they could buy plates and then just put different license plates on the car and say well it was from the state and they were selling them and so so this brother came to brother Graham said my cars being stolen all that closer and there they were they got down and prayed and they prayed that God would restore the car back to the man back to the brother and then Brougham saw a vision of the man who stole it driving it and the Holy Spirit convicted him and then he and then he stopped and he drove to a certain place left the keys there in the car and he left it and brother man said you'll find it in a certain place and they drove there and they found it exactly where he said and so now that was just a restoration of a of a vehicle how much more someone that's walked out of underneath the influence of the Holy Ghost I mean who's still in slavery who's still in darkness I mean brother says we ever right I mean by the law of God to enforce upon Satan our god-given rights that we can send God's agent the Holy Ghost hallelujah and God has to restore it amen and that's more than just now that's more than just a vehicle or something that's been stolen what about a son or daughter of God that's been stolen by the enemy we have a right to enforce amen a restoration hallelujah we do it's time to stand up and take guard his words Alleluia Amen you say well how's that so greater is in you then that devil that maybe in that person a man the Holy Ghost is more powerful that's greater than any enemy that may be afflicting or tormenting hallelujah he can break her yoke he knows how to do it amen now we have to be a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish they say well I could never obtain to that now in our humanity we cannot obtain to it but it's like going down into into Goshen where the children of Israel were on the night of the Passover here they are there sitting in there maybe before this they heard the promise we've got a land flowing with milk and honey waiting for us it was it was promised to our father Abraham that is that his descendants would would go and possess the land and you know they've got their aches and their pains and it hurts and their scars and maybe their backs of you know they're pulled some muscles and hurts them yeah it was back-breaking labor and when God said when Moses went down into Egypt the labor got harder amen the devil tried to put more pressure on I'll not let them go now they not only have to make bricks they're going to click their own straw he made it twice as hard for them and so now they wouldn't have just been all limbered up ready for a nice stroll to the promised land they would have had pulled shoulders that would have been maybe pulled muscles and calcified shoulders and oh you're from the labor you know of moving burdens and being beaten and maybe malnourished I don't know but they wouldn't have been in perfect health and some of them were very old when they left when they left Egypt that night and so maybe something beginning to think how am I going to get over to that Promised Land how am I ever going to hear walk over there and all they had to do was not look at the obstacles they need to look at the distance even though they didn't know how far it was they didn't know how they need to worry about all those things all they had to do is to the lamb killed the lamb put the blood on the door lentil eat that lamb and the unleavened bread amen and they receive strength from eating the lamb hallelujah they receive strength from eating that unleavened bread hallelujah and Caleb spent 40 odd years walking out on that strength of that sacrifice because he was 80 odd years old he's standing before Joshua and he says I'm as strong this day as the day I left Egypt now give me this mountain I mean Moses told them in the book of Deuteronomy which was 40 years after they left Egypt your shoes haven't got old your clothes haven't yo got old either hallelujah because they had walked out on a supernatural promise I mean they'd walked out of Egypt on a supernatural promise so they're closed and we're out there shoes didn't wear out I mean they were just as good as the day they put them on hallelujah Caleb was just as strong he was eighty odd years old here was a slave hallelujah a former slave amen that that took the promise of God he received strength for the lamb are you following me this displaced me today I don't believe it was the fumes in the lab Roz working I was genuinely blessed I mean because we can walk we can walk from we can walk from this world to the next world because of the substance of the Lamb I mean because we become one with our sacrifice Holly that he gives us supernatural strength hallelujah amen how are you going to get to that Promised Land just just start eating the lamb I mean just studying the left don't worry about what a you know whatever else is going on take the lamb eat that lamb eat the unleavened bread it'll give you strength hallelujah we've got a seven course you know a seven course menu or whatever you want to call it we're got a full buffet we've got the whole lamb we don't just have a leg or a shank or a cutlet whatever we've got the whole lamb to eat hallelujah we're going to see them and seal menu I mean we've got a full word date hallelujah and Josh I went and he took his Mountain a mint because he walked out of Egypt on the strength of that lamb lujah and it's got to be the same thing with us I mean you really mixed the word with faith you will possess the promise the Bible says and in Matthew it says in Matthew 2 fulfilling a scripture I mean a prophecy says when he arose he took the young child this is Joseph taking Jesus and Mary says and he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by the lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son and if you go back into the Old Testament that does not only speak of Jesus but it was speaking of Israel coming out of Egypt under the Ministry of Moses that was God calling his son out of Egypt I mean so he was calling his son they they weren't slaves to God they were his children they were his son and he was going to take his son and place him in his inheritance in the promised land amen so now Caleb manifested that promise because he wasn't just called out of Egypt but he was placed he took his mountain amen he took his mountain he took his inheritance hallelujah and just sit back and say well if God will give it to me he'll give it to me if not if not a min but he received his inheritance hallelujah is just like I read on your on Sunday from the Song of Solomon the bridegroom is saying to the bride set me as a seal upon my heart and upon thy arm holy is saying let my anointing abide Amen in your heart in your heart and then also let my anointing anoint you what you do but not in your hands Amen anoint your feet and not your eyes anoint your tongue hallelujah I meant that our works would be anointed by God I mean the life that we live would be anointed by God it wouldn't just be our own ability but God would take that ability to anoint it and then to make it live alleluia now the many times we sometimes we can we can think God has just angry at us all the time and we actually must understand the heart of God towards his children this is shown in the and the parable of the prodigal son where the protocol son we know he he said I want my inheritance now and he and he went to a foreign country and he and he spent it all and he wasted it all and then he comes to himself in a pigpen and he and he now says to himself I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to be called my father's son anymore I just go back to his house because his servants are feed better than I am they're in a better condition that I am and then so he thinks because I've done this I'm not worthy to be called the son therefore I'll ask if I can just be one of the servants now this is this is what we think many times because we we always put what we have done and we put it on one side of the scale and then we put on the other side of the scale are we worthy to obtain the promise and we think because we've squandered time and we and we're wasted maybe years or whatever it was they were not worthy they meant to possess the promise that have been placed in the body of Christ as an adopted son Alleluia so he says now I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to be caught my father said anymore I've sinned against heaven and and against him so he says I'm no longer worthy to be called thy son make me as one of our hired servants but this wasn't the father's attitude the father wasn't interested in and turning a sadist into a servant the father was only interested in seeing his son redeemed I mean placed back in his rightful position in the family hallelujah and you can see this in the in the parable where the father commands his servants to bring forth the best robe put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet I mean to restore him with an adoption robe hallelujah friends we've seen an adopted son in this age nothing could stand before his praise if he could get the people to believe him not even cancer every demon had to go I'm in nature had to obey Him this had to give us your death had to give captives back up again hallelujah I mean nothing could stand before that man because he was placed in the body of Christ and now that he was an example to us because God was showing this is what I'm going to do I mean and I'm going to make you like this I mean that everything in your Dominion has to bow to you hallelujah that's why is Binger being a mum I mean in your position in Christ no enemy can stand before you in their position hallelujah being a being a husband as the head of the house Amen if you're standing your position nothing can stand before you amen hallelujah this is not theory this is lived and God's life is here to manifest that amen now brother Brahim says here in the over there he he said that we would overcome and we overcome by our faith this is the victory even our faith the scripture tells us that faith is a revelation of who he is and who we are in him I mean that's how we overcome we know who he is he has revealed himself to us amen and then we know who we are in him amen that's how we overcome because we know that we're just not from from from some culture or some country and I mean but we we begin to understand that we came from heaven as Jesus says I came from God I'm going back to God hallelujah and brother Graham tells us if if we ever had eternal life we always had eternal life because eternal never had a beginning or an end I meant so we always had it you just had to come and recognize it Amen God took the spirit of unbelief out of your life gave you a new nature amen you begin to realize who you really are Alleluia amen now we ever write the call on his name and he wants us to call upon him now it's very different all of us parents here it's very different when you hear another child cry you are you are concerned yeah if you hear another child crying a temp ain't your concern but it's very different when you hear your own child cry and they're in pain there's something that moves very differently in your heart when you hear your own child crying hallelujah now and it's the same thing with God when he is his children cry out to him it moves him in a different way I mean it means a great deal to him when Jesus told the parable of the of the woman and the unjust judge you know he's telling you amen he's more than an unjust judge that just gets weary with someone asking I see and I see you're asking amen that's not how our God operates but he wants you to be like that woman to call upon God day and night hallelujah amen so there's something very different winners winners children call upon him I mean it moves him a very special way amen just like your own children when you hear them and it puts you in direction now we will always need him I'm just kind of maybe jumping around a lot but you know we were created you just take nature everything in nature was made to need something else there's not one thing in nature they mean upon this earth that is yourself existing doesn't need anything amen you take the grass you take all of the bottling life it needs sunshine it needs water and these nutrients you take any of those things away and that plant will not grow like it's mean - it needs though it was created to need those things any part of the food chain needs the other part of the food chain amen every single part of that food chain is vital and it needs the other parts amen you take any of those you cut the food chain and you see nature begin to go the chaos just like it is now with certain species they man may look at and say what roles this have we have no idea it's kind of a useless thing but God put it there because something needed that in the in the in the ecosystem all nature is made to need something else and that's just how much more now when it comes to man I mean human beings were made to need a lujah this is wonderful you know because you got to read about you but but people you know these are saying no man no man is an island that means no man is just all by himself and you know you know and and doesn't need anything we all need something amen and it's just natural we need food we need you know we need shelter we need light we need meat we need those things that's just natural things how much more now now that's just God on a natural level he made us that way funny but he made you that way because he wants you to understand and know you need him I mean that's why we're liking to sheep because sheep need a shepherd they need they need someone to lead them even the head chief doesn't know a whole bunch because they start leading that one and then they start leading this one and then this one's over here and they you know have you ever seen sheep wander around the paddock they just wander but they think they know it looks like an inn one sheep starts walking this way then then you see 500 sheep moving along the hilltop and that one doesn't know where it's going but everyone's following it where God made us like there because he wants us to always always recognize we need him and there'll never be a time when we don't need him I mean there'll never be a time away where we think well we have it all together now I'm adopted son or daughter of God I mean I've got this open word in my hand I know I'm possessing every promise that they everything you know demons under my feet now I don't need them know we'll always need them we'll always need them Alleluia and it's very important we recognize this because he made us that way that we can depend upon him they men and sissies in Hebrews 11 it says and what more shall I say this is the chapter of faith as we know for the time would fail me to tell of gideon america of samson of jitney of david also and samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens so out of weakness they were made strong but they did great exploits of faith they meant that's the same thing with us we will always need him amen that's why we've got to push it off to one side where we think well maybe one day we'll just have it all together and we'll just be able to run the show ourselves will always need him mm we'll always need him if we man when man tries to take everything into their own hands it always fails amen but if you keep everything in God's hands and it can never fail because he knows how it should go amen so we will always need him it's in order you know brother Graham talks about in the adoption series which is about the tutor raises up the child until the child is ready and and one part of the big criteria with the child being ready as brother and dramatizes with the tutor says to the child okay now we're going to walk up this hill we're going to go this way we're going to go through this some dangerous places and the child says well as long as you've got me by the hand we'll be there it'll be all right I'll follow you I'll leave the tutors the Holy Ghost amen so that's part of now now now the child's really a mean because he because he knows who's leading him he knows who's taking him up hallelujah it's got to be the same thing with us I mean you say well well we're going through some deep water well as long as it leads me through as long as it leads me through I'll be all right I mean well there's a lot of enemies garrison well as long as he leads me through amen he wants to lead me through a victory praise the Lord hallelujah he's got my best interests in mind Amy sees in Christ as mr. God revealed he says but when the current is flowing freely the Word of God it expresses itself the works that I do show you do also in the last days it shall come to pass behold i send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a time come forth when he would express himself when the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have a preeminence as in his church oh my what the anointed man that was jesus the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by by accepting he's his why by accepting what eve turned down an adam turning back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit seed he anointed with the word what eve turned down he he comes back and we accepted cease now here comes a time where where where it was in its the anointed man but now the anointed people where that word becomes as anointed becomes flesh in them and they possess every promise hallelujah and we're living in that day I mean where God would take a people lift them up to what they mean to be in him I mean this is why this is more than a church I'm talking about the body of Christ around the world it's more than just having church order and having everything just right in the t's crossed and the I's daughter to the earth it's more than that and having you know it's God manifesting through our people hallelujah it's more than just having nice families it's God manifesting through the family it's God showing this is what this is what the family should be hallelujah everyone in their position one heart one mind one Accord I mean living for one another preferring one another and love how the ouya because remember we need each other I mean as a church party at Anna's honor and and as in a family as well we need one another we were made to meet one another's needs hallelujah that we prefer one another and love I mean where it's more than just more than just you're putting on a good appearance of things but God comes and lives amen because an adopted son or daughter of God amen is now placed in their position in the body amen and God manifests whatever they're called to do God manifests himself through that person hallelujah and that's what we're that's what we've caught ordinance our you say well I've heard this for years and years and years Moses told the children of Israel he says 40 years you've been in this message he saw the miracles in Egypt you saw the Red Sea part you saw God come down on Mount Sinai but yet God has not given you eyes to perceive or ears to hear until this day and they were 40 years down the road and here they were they're about to cross over into the promised land the word had just come up and they began to see who they were amen and brother Brahim says when the bride knows what she is in the rapture will go when she knows what she is and she is the word she is the word manifested in this hour they meant she is the Living Word manifested in this hour where God is veil behind skin once again amen you may think well I'm just a little old me God has veil behind skin once again brother Rome says that deity is not just in heaven but Siddhant but it is in you I mean many times people pray about Jesus being up in heaven someplace but he doesn't want to be separated from us he's not just in heaven but that same God is in the believer I mean just like on the day of Pentecost when the pillar of fire came into it when the Holy Ghost came into the Upper Room and man man and God would became United and God came in 12th and a hundred and twenty of his children I mean Jesus wasn't just in heaven Aires and a people I mean because when Paul Paul met met God on the road to Damascus he says who are you lord and the voice of the light says I am Jesus whom their persecutors now Paul wasn't chasing a supernatural being he was taking looking men and woman throwing them into prison amen but because deity was in them that's why Jesus could say you know you other what you're persecuting me amen and so you say well why are you saying all this do you know what power lays with them the believer Jesus said nothing is impossible to them that belief nothing is impossible to them that belief that means there is nothing impossible with you nothing is put as impossible to them that belief I mean all things are possible only belief amen and that's why we need to go beyond just our five senses and go beyond our imagination and go beyond what we think is going to happen take Auditors word discard the five senses discard your imagination and reasoning and affection and conscious and and and memory lay aside those things take God at His Word amen and then all things will become possible amen we're in 2018 we're at the end of all things you know we're gonna start believing for all things being possible I mean when there's particles that have to come home his wayward ones that must come amen if God can if God can bless Abraham enough that he would allow him to go savers nephew amen how much more ain't meant more than just the yo Abraham is a natural man but how much more supernatural Bride of Christ I mean they're more than just a friend of God but they become married to him they meant those his nephew he went and rescued him from the risky them from the armies of the kings hallelujah he interceded for Sodom and Gomorrah but he didn't go down far enough a number amen and now here we are here we are we we have become one with Jesus Christ amen all power jesus's all power in heaven earth has given to me now where is that power now if it if Jesus than you Amen now you just got to give yourself to him and what he wants to do he'll do but we can't just put God in a box and say well I've never seen it done it can't really happen how do I know it could happen well it's just on tape fifty years ago Amen you gotta gotta go beyond that and say if he's the same then he's the same today amen if he can do the same thing back then when people would come up in a prayer line and God would speak to him and say you're not here for yourself you're here from someone you know you're here for someone in there in a mental institution I mean go and find them be well in the name of Jesus Christ and those people win and find them well amen in a sound mind that spirit left them hallelujah and God uses showing us those things don't look at what you see and and the symptoms and what the devil may be trying to do don't look at those things take the promise hallelujah I think this Easter we need to enforce upon Satan I mean by the Holy Spirit our god-given rights a man he's a squatter kick him off hallelujah and squatters normally dwell in a place where well he's a natural example so from Papua New Guinea when the you know people who earn a whole bunch of land like like the company my dad worked for they had a whole bunch of land but there was a volcano eruption and so all the places were years ago they had big houses there big eruption leveled the place they didn't rebuild so just all grass and when the grass would grow high enough in the squatters would come in because they think well they can't see I said here we're gonna live in here that build huts that have villages all these different things and then eventually they you know that you know they had to be kicked off and that kicked off but then all the grass was cut down and the place was maintained properly so the squatters couldn't come back amen and it's the same thing now I'm going to bring it into your dish you say well that's that's kind of comical but it's the same thing with us we get our joy we get our peace we have such a glorious prayer time a glorious you know time in the word and we just walk with Him but then if we neglect what we're doing the grass begins to grow the devil comes on the devil begins to come on your territory hallelujah so it's more than just enforcing them to get out you got to cut the grass you were to take possession put up some fences a man put up some fences get some security guards in there hallelujah pay them enough that they don't turn on you not that the Holy Ghost that's what happens over there anyway but I'm trying to push show you a point you know it takes actually a maintenance of a walk it's like a relationship you've got to keep working at that relationship I mean you just can't say well he's wearing my ring I'm wearing her I mean you know whichever way she she's got my wedding band I gave her and I'm wearing hers in you know let's just watch the world go by you got to work at that relationship I mean you can't just take it for granted back and say well that's just how it is you know you can't let the grass grow amen you say well we live in a busy age sure we do but gods gives us the power he didn't throw us into the sage and say sink or swim see how you go he doesn't just he didn't throw his bride into the sage just to see what's going to happen he's in Judah with power I mean he's in Judah with with grace to overcome hallelujah he's in Judah with the ability to live a holy separated life to God and the darkest most busy age he's ever been Allu you he doesn't say well let's see how you go remember the power of God is always greater than that of the enemy it's always greater who knows about the greater than sign the greater than sign is the one that is greater than the other is always greater there's no greater or equals to in God's economy amen but we have to we have to pick up the sword of the word we're going to put on the whole armor of God and if you're still entertaining because the devil comes along and entices you and if you still entertain that thought then he's got you in a hole I mean if you're still entertaining it he's got you in a hole you got to kick that thing down you've got a turn and reject it completely amen because otherwise you still got you in a hole amen let's take all things we're more than able to go take the country as I've said before Joshua had the same same whooping marks that the other slaves did the other spies did but something in them said let's go take it him and him in heaven Joshua and Caleb they had the scars but they didn't let the scars of the past hold them back from possessing their inheritance I mean because they they recognized we weren't meant to be slaves that's not what God thought of us our God thought of us as his children and in our inheritance and that's the same thing with us don't look at the scars as in our world this is what I was or this is what I am rather you look at the scars and say I used to maybe be this way have made me this bitterness or resentment or unforgiveness or this whatever it was it scared us up but I don't have it anymore that's just a reminder I'm free hallelujah amen that's you know amen you say well I've been down some real deep water in some horrible places amen just look at those scars and just remind yourself you're not in those dark horrible deep waters anymore I was lost on that in the world the devil just used me as a whipping boy well praise God you're not that place anymore amen oh but it was a terrible horrible time praise God you're not there anymore it depends of what you look at the scars amen hey your prisoner to your past are you rejoicing that that was your pastor not your prisoner and not your future hey a men he's called us to an adoption this is an adoption age this message is an adoption message where the Word of God places us in our position and that's what this message does hallelujah don't worry about the devil you know sometimes you got to cast them out sometimes you just go to ignore them walk on because the devil will come back around again you try and fight you in the same battle and you say I fought this before and you may defeat him again he comes around again sometimes you just gotta just ignore him and keep walking amen just keep walking anyway amen that we would know as we are known I'll read this from the token and in and in some musicians the musician should come he sees when God was first when when God made them first man he made him a son and the son was so corrupt he listened to his wife instead of God and the woman listened to the devil instead of her husband and when it did it corrupted them together that had bought a pollution he knew that when they did that they miss it they had to bring children into the world as his the the fruit and the midst of the tree could not be touched and when it was they brought the sin upon themselves and therefore the whole human race was born was born wasn't sin there's no way to come out and when God and then God came down there's only one way to get him back that's to get him back a son again now how can he do it when his own law stood there and he said he's condemned then the father himself became one of us that's the real lamb that's his purpose he had in mind that's the reason the lamb was so identified in the Garden of Eden knowing that the lamb and dove would meet at one time when the lamb and of would be together and when he'd known through that we can all be together and he was willing to make such a sacrifice now that the token could be applied that we are no more aliens we're no more strangers but we're sons and daughters of God both Adam and Eve the woman and the man joined together our sons and daughters of God in Christ Jesus by his great sacrifice hallelujah you're on their way back as he could make them sons and daughters again so he became one of us in order to do it how Luke where's the musicians please I meant out of Egypt I have called my son he spoke of Israel he spoke of Jesus it's the same thing with us out of the world he has called us bride hallelujah doesn't that make you happy you say well I'm facing a lot of giants just take one at a time Amen just face one enemy at a time and then when you take that part of the land cut the grass down put up a wall maintain the garden Amen Alleluia how's your prayer life doing how's your listening you know the devil all of us technology is to get this mind on off off the Lord and and on other things amen I'm gonna say this I downloaded an app today to see how much time I spent on this thing I'm afraid of how much time it is it's a distraction you got to know how to manage these things because you can spend hours just looking at nothing one of the most some of the most watched video I'm not saying this as a joke some of the most watched videos on YouTube err cat videos and humanity is watching cats do ridiculous things and it's very popular and you may think that is crazy that's what people do and we use up our time now there's nothing wrong with my brother Encino the rules you'll hit your hunting fishing whatever he did those soon see it closer to God and relax I mean so we need something that all I'm not comparing hunting and fishing while the Prophet did the cat videos but you know we made we need time to relax right go take some days off go to holiday you understand what I'm saying I hope this is down in the middle but we get so absorbed into stuff and we spend hours looking at things and then where are we and our mind is full of the stuff that doesn't matter and our imagination is off on some some things that don't and half the news that's on the news do we need to know it do we really need to know it and yet we're but yet it's presented in such a way and it's out there in such a way that all this is going on that then actually helped me in my life no hope I made my life a little bit worse did I really need to know that no it's where the grass begins to grow and squatters can come on I mean what he I'm in yeah that's standing saying they were able to go up and take the country you know you say well what we should do they say Lord and Creasy I love for you that we I just saw in love for you that's all we want to do they mean now we know we have our families if you love the Lord you love your family amen if you really love him you want it to pour through you to your family and you want to give yourself for them but if there's something that's taking up our time it should be Lord take away my love for that thing and may I love you more than that thing that's why many times it's not what we have to let go it's just Lord we just need to love the Lord Jesus more because you do what you love the most Amen people who love doing things it's not a burden for them that's right yeah you know you see some people they do you know they do extreme stuff you think man I would never do that that's because they love doing it and they're not ashamed or feel bad you know that they their whole lives are built around one thing that's because they love it and it should be the same thing with us Lord make us love you more then if things are taking up our time and whatever more that those things will just become strangely done we'll be caught up in you I mean I'm a listener cygnus we are able to go up and take to possess the land from gone into the sea all the Giants maybe there are
