[24:14] hallelujah welcome to this prayer
[24:16] evening tonight amen God bless you all
[24:18] great to have everyone here amen we're
[24:20] just going to go turn to um we're just
[24:23] going to read a couple of places we're
[24:25] going to start in um Isaiah
[24:29] 53 and: 1 down to verse 7 amen you know
[24:33] there's a uh there's a reason why we
[24:34] stand for the reading of the word in a
[24:36] service just like a you know in a
[24:37] courtroom the judge comes in you know
[24:39] everyone stands to attention or the king
[24:41] or something and we believe when we read
[24:43] the word there's the Lord coming in amen
[24:44] so more than tradition but you we want
[24:46] to respect the word and love him more
[24:48] than ever before amen amen so let's um
[24:51] let's read this here Isaiah 53:1 who
[24:53] hath believed our report and to whom is
[24:56] the arm of the Lord revealed for those
[24:58] who believe his report the arm of the
[24:59] Lord has been revealed for he shall grow
[25:01] up before him as a tender plant and as a
[25:03] root out of a dry ground he hath no form
[25:06] nor comeliness and when we shall see him
[25:09] there is no beauty that we should desire
[25:11] him he has despised and rejected of men
[25:14] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[25:15] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[25:19] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[25:21] him not surely he hath borne our griefs
[25:24] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[25:26] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[25:29] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[25:32] transgressions he was bruised for our
[25:34] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[25:37] was upon him and with his stripes we're
[25:39] healed we all sorry all we like sheep
[25:43] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[25:45] to his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[25:48] him the iniquity of us all he was
[25:50] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[25:52] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[25:54] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[25:56] before Herer is dumbb so he openeth not
[26:00] his mouth amen then we're going to go to
[26:02] Zechariah there's just one verse here
[26:04] I'd like to read in Zechariah 12 and and
[26:06] verse 10 and uh just as you're turning
[26:10] there I'd just like to I just want to
[26:11] speak about the value of a
[26:13] scar amen we have a time of prayer but
[26:16] this is where I'm going with this amen
[26:18] so the value of a scar some scars
[26:20] actually all scars are actually
[26:22] Priceless if God can get a hold of them
[26:24] and use them for his glory amen so
[26:26] Zechariah 12 and10 and it says here and
[26:28] I'll pour upon the House of David and
[26:31] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[26:33] spirit of Grace and of supplications and
[26:35] they shall look upon me whom they have
[26:38] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[26:40] one mourneth for his only son and shall
[26:43] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[26:45] in bitterness for his firstborn amen so
[26:49] let's just uh go to the Lord in prayer
[26:51] tonight amen as as we've read his word
[26:53] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[26:55] thankful we can sing you are a miracle
[26:57] working God God how true that is Lord
[27:00] Jesus and we're so thankful Lord you
[27:01] have not stopped Lord doing the
[27:03] miraculous oh God lord saving the Lost
[27:06] Healing The Sick raising the dead
[27:07] casting out Devils Lord manifesting your
[27:10] word we're so thankful that we can bow
[27:12] our heads in your presence and Lord give
[27:14] you glory and praise we thank you that
[27:16] we can gather this night we ask that you
[27:18] would walk among us touch our hearts
[27:20] like only you can and dear God we
[27:22] greatly desire that when when when we're
[27:24] all praying at the end of the service it
[27:26] wouldn't be us praying but Lord may you
[27:27] pray through US Lord may your mind be
[27:30] spoken father may you have your way Lord
[27:32] we just want to submit ourselves under
[27:34] your Mighty hand and I pray you'd
[27:35] forgive us of all of our sins and our
[27:37] trespasses cover us in your blood Lord
[27:40] wash us clean Lord dear God as we
[27:42] approach your great presence tonight we
[27:44] pray You' just have mer you you'd be
[27:46] merciful to us and have your way in this
[27:48] service and also those who who couldn't
[27:50] make it tonight be their portion Lord
[27:52] remember them Father be with them we
[27:54] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[27:57] amen God bless you friends you can have
[27:59] your seats tonight as we just have a
[28:01] have a little bit of time here so I want
[28:02] to speak about the value of a scar now
[28:05] scars have incredible value because of
[28:08] the story behind them some people have
[28:10] incredible scars I'm talking about even
[28:12] you know natural if you could look at
[28:14] you know many many people have been
[28:15] through a lot of great experiences some
[28:17] are some are um you know greatly
[28:20] troubling some are incredible things
[28:22] where life and death was hanging hanging
[28:24] in the balance but every scar has value
[28:27] now we would look as as you know we
[28:28] would read here in Isaiah chapter 53
[28:31] about the you know about the scars or
[28:33] the wounds that our lord Jesus would
[28:35] receive and you know they are the
[28:36] greatest scars that ever come upon a
[28:38] human being is when our lord Jesus died
[28:40] on Calvary for you and I he purchased
[28:42] our Redemption and it was a complete
[28:44] Redemption that he that he purchased
[28:46] there he didn't have to pay any more he
[28:47] was wounded more than any other man and
[28:49] you know it was incredible incredible
[28:51] event that took place there but you know
[28:53] isn't it isn't it so amazing that you
[28:55] know we can look at things in life that
[28:57] affect us because you know we're all
[28:59] going to we all have a testimony yeah
[29:01] and I believe Heaven's going to be a
[29:03] testimony time about what he's done in
[29:05] our lives but you know he needs the Holy
[29:08] Ghost I was hearing brother Braham I
[29:09] can't remember if it was on in the
[29:10] indictment or you message but you know
[29:13] brother Braham was saying the Lord needs
[29:15] people to work through he needs he needs
[29:18] people to surrender themselves to him
[29:20] that he can work through their lives now
[29:22] scars can can can um scars can work two
[29:27] ways and it's up to you they can either
[29:30] make you live in the past and be hurtful
[29:32] and question and wonder and be bitter
[29:34] and resentful and all those things or it
[29:37] can give God glory yes my Lord and God
[29:40] can use them you know I was thinking I
[29:41] was trying to get my I don't know if I
[29:43] can really ever get my head around it
[29:44] but God just decided to allow scars to
[29:47] come into human beings and pain we know
[29:50] because of sin there's you know we're
[29:51] under the effects of not in in terms of
[29:54] being under the Dominion of unbelief but
[29:56] we're born in these bodies we have these
[29:57] human spirits that can be damaged and
[29:59] hurt and pain can come into our spirit
[30:02] or our body can affect us physically or
[30:04] emotionally different things but you
[30:06] know everything that happens to a
[30:08] Believer happens for a reason and God In
[30:11] His Infinite Mercy or wisdom decided
[30:13] this is how he's going to he's going to
[30:15] allow things to come into life that then
[30:17] he that that that we can give them to
[30:19] him and then he can use them for his
[30:21] glory you know just like with this um
[30:23] speaking here in John chapter 9 here
[30:25] there was this man that was born blind
[30:27] and disciples were asking is it was it
[30:29] his sin his parents sin or what's the
[30:31] reason you know that that he was born
[30:33] this way and Jesus said no you actually
[30:35] got the wrong end of the stick it's that
[30:37] the works of God would be manifest in
[30:38] him so this so this inment this
[30:41] impediment this problem that you know no
[30:43] doubt you know he would have just sat
[30:45] there he couldn't he couldn't walk
[30:46] normally like any other child he
[30:48] couldn't behave and you know he couldn't
[30:50] be like any of the other boys playing
[30:51] whatever games they played in that day
[30:53] cuz he was blind but you see and you
[30:56] know he did sit in Duck says we know but
[30:58] there came a point where the where the
[31:00] Lord himself came and touched him and
[31:02] healed him and he wasn't a blind man no
[31:04] more and then he walked around with a
[31:06] testimony because after this the scribes
[31:08] and Pharisees got a hold of him he came
[31:10] in front of them and they wanted to know
[31:12] what who did this and what happened and
[31:14] you know and this man would testify in
[31:16] front of them all I know is I was blind
[31:18] but now I see because they trying to say
[31:20] this man's a sinner and give God the
[31:22] praise and all these things and even his
[31:24] own parents wouldn't testify on his
[31:25] behalf yeah but he said all I know as I
[31:28] was blind but now I see am mean so what
[31:30] he began to testify of the glory of God
[31:33] in his life he wasn't no longer standing
[31:36] there saying oh all those Wasted Years
[31:39] all those things I missed out on all
[31:41] those things I could have experienced he
[31:43] didn't look at those things anymore
[31:44] because he was blind but now he could
[31:46] see so now here was a man who had never
[31:49] no one else had a testimony like him
[31:52] amen cuz he was born blind right so now
[31:53] he had a testimony the very God of
[31:56] creation made new eyes in me amen caused
[31:59] me to see Hallelujah so it became a
[32:01] glorious thing it was it was a scar but
[32:03] it wasn't a negative scar it was a very
[32:06] positive Scar and you can look at all
[32:08] the Believers down through the Bible
[32:10] many of them came from damaged homes
[32:12] many of them came from troubled lives
[32:14] many of them were broken people but God
[32:17] came and used them for his glory even
[32:19] many of them had no idea what they were
[32:21] living out you take Ruth or Rahab or
[32:23] Tamar or you know many of the Great
[32:26] Believers of Faith down through the
[32:27] Bible they didn't know they're living
[32:29] out God's Plan of Redemption as a shadow
[32:31] they didn't know they representing a
[32:33] bride of Christ in the end time they
[32:35] were just living through life and they
[32:36] had great trouble and pain and hurt but
[32:39] God used them to display himself amen so
[32:43] now how much more you and I that we can
[32:45] look back and say thank you lordu I was
[32:48] wounded but now I'm Healed I was broken
[32:51] and now I'm mended now if you're still
[32:54] wrestling with your past give it to God
[32:56] Amen let him bring healing into your
[32:58] life let him bring healing let him bring
[33:00] stability let him bring peace you say I
[33:02] don't know why I Was Born This Way well
[33:04] God allowed you to be born a certain way
[33:07] cuz he wanted to display his glory in
[33:09] your life am mean just like this man who
[33:11] is who was born blind because you see
[33:14] we're going to realize that we don't
[33:15] have a say how God wants to fulfill his
[33:17] word in our life Christine and I were
[33:19] talking about you know Elijah here and
[33:21] you know you know how God told them
[33:23] after he went before Ahab and Jezebel
[33:25] saying there won't be any rain or due to
[33:26] I call for it and then God tells him I'm
[33:29] going to send unclean Birds scavengers
[33:33] to feed you they're going to be the
[33:35] delivery they're going to be the drones
[33:36] amen that are going to bring your
[33:38] contactless meals to you while you s sit
[33:41] by this Brook now if if if Elijah wasn't
[33:44] surrendered to God he'd said God you're
[33:46] wrong these are scavenger Birds they're
[33:48] unclean Birds I'm a holy prophet I'm
[33:50] dedicated to you you know this is a
[33:52] wrong way I don't agree with what you're
[33:54] doing God this is wrong but he wasn't
[33:56] like that cuz surrendered to God Amen he
[33:59] believed that God would sustain him if
[34:01] God said I'm sending you Ravens with
[34:03] food Ravens came with food hallelujah
[34:05] amen then they came a time when the
[34:06] brook got lower and lower and lower and
[34:08] lower and then God said go to a foreign
[34:10] land go out of Israel and if he wasn't
[34:13] happy about it he was say God you're
[34:14] wrong you're sending me out of my
[34:16] inheritance God this is not right see we
[34:20] want God to be a miracle right we want
[34:21] to see him be a Mir we want to see his
[34:23] Supernatural hand but we've got to let
[34:26] him do it how he wants to do it am amen
[34:27] we want to see God needs a people to
[34:31] give themselves to him that he can be
[34:33] the
[34:34] miracle am but how he does it is his
[34:36] prerogative that's right amen so so so
[34:39] Elijah there's no account of him saying
[34:41] here in this account or when he sent to
[34:43] the um widow woman God you're wrong why
[34:45] does it have to be this way God this is
[34:47] not fair God I'm not happy with what
[34:49] you're doing God are you really in
[34:50] control God now God said go by the Brook
[34:53] jerith and I'll bring you Ravens or feed
[34:55] you praise the Lord here I go amen finds
[34:57] a comfy spot in the shade no doubt
[34:59] breakfast lunch dinner I don't know how
[35:01] many times I eat in those days but he
[35:03] got fed yeah and he drank from the brook
[35:05] and maybe the brook got low and low
[35:06] maybe had to dig a hole to get some
[35:07] water and all these things but then the
[35:09] same voice said to him now go to what
[35:11] the zidonians or wherever and there's a
[35:13] widow woman there she'll sustain the
[35:15] okay Lord here I go amen oh but why Lord
[35:19] no he didn't ask why he said praise God
[35:22] Lord I'm on my way I'm walking with the
[35:23] pillar of fire am amen and it's got to
[35:25] be the same way with you and I see God's
[35:29] God thank you he's he he's the
[35:32] professional worker outou of of paths
[35:34] and ordering paths and he knows the
[35:36] future and he knows he knows what he
[35:38] wants to get out of you but are we
[35:40] surrender that he will whatever he wants
[35:42] to display he's going to display it
[35:45] because I doubt very much you know you
[35:47] know if if if we were conscience you
[35:50] know conscious we we knew what we were
[35:52] signing up for when we're in glory I
[35:54] doubt any any of us would have said pick
[35:56] me Lord for that job
[35:58] do you think Ruth wanted to be Ruth you
[36:01] know do you think do you think actually
[36:03] her her mom-in-law would have said yes
[36:04] I'll be that one go now I'm just talking
[36:06] about the natural things she had to go
[36:08] through now if if if the supernatural
[36:10] side all those things were hidden you
[36:12] know you're going to go through hardship
[36:13] you're going to lose your husband you're
[36:15] going to lose your sons you're going to
[36:16] be in Moab you're going to come back
[36:17] with nothing you're going to be so
[36:19] bitter in your spirit that say call me
[36:21] Mara now right Moses Moses you're going
[36:25] to be 40 years in Pharaoh's Palace 40
[36:27] years on the back side of the desert
[36:29] you're not going to see the promised
[36:30] land because of your own Humanity but oh
[36:32] but Angels when you die are going to
[36:33] pack you there so it's okay but you know
[36:36] all these things that have to
[36:39] endure but yet I believe being Believers
[36:42] would say yes Lord amen amen amen I
[36:45] believe as Believers I'm not coning what
[36:47] I just said but I'm I believe as
[36:48] Believers say yes Lord I'll go through
[36:51] and the reason I can say that is because
[36:53] even now when we don't understand why
[36:55] and we're not sure what's really going
[36:56] on all we know is God's
[36:58] leading this is not IDE deal it is IDE
[37:01] deal we're in the will of God that's it
[37:03] praise the Lord Jonah was in the will of
[37:05] God in a whale's belly yeah whether you
[37:07] like it or not because because the nites
[37:09] worshiped a whale god what happened
[37:11] their Prophet stepped out of their God
[37:12] and began preaching to them yeah right
[37:16] hallelujah amen as as like brother
[37:18] Braham said many people say Jonah was
[37:20] backler but he always took up for Jonah
[37:22] right CU he's actually walking in the
[37:24] will of God you say well he ran from the
[37:26] prince of God God ordained all those
[37:28] things y That's right to allow him to
[37:30] get there okay so you know we got to we
[37:33] got to really say Lord whatever you want
[37:35] for my life give me Grace to walk in it
[37:38] Lord and and be happy in the same token
[37:42] we're on our way to heaven shouting
[37:43] Victory amen but see we've got to be see
[37:46] Elijah didn't work out what God was
[37:48] going to do he just followed God it's
[37:50] got to be the same thing with you and I
[37:52] amen see Moses would I mean Michelangelo
[37:55] would spend I don't know how many years
[37:56] sculpting this
[37:58] this is a tomb of a on a tomb of a pope
[38:00] and he was um he was commissioned to to
[38:02] make a make a statue of Moses out of a
[38:05] solid piece of marble I can't remember
[38:07] the height of this thing but it was a
[38:08] solid slab of marble now Michelangelo
[38:12] and his mind knew what Moses would look
[38:14] like he didn't have any paint he didn't
[38:16] have a picture of Moses but he just the
[38:18] inspiration was in him and he started
[38:20] chisling away and I don't know how he
[38:22] did it but you know even apparently even
[38:24] the details of the muscles on Moses
[38:26] forarm everything how his fingers are
[38:28] and and what it makes the that's all
[38:30] accurate that's perfect you see and he
[38:33] spent years molding and shaping Moses
[38:35] out of a piece of stone
[38:38] now he came to a point where where the
[38:41] inspiration that was in his heart was
[38:43] now made material in front of him and he
[38:45] got so excited he took up his hammer and
[38:48] he smoked it on the knee you can't see
[38:49] it oh it's about here in the picture um
[38:52] there's this there's this crack cuz he
[38:55] got so inspired he picked up the hammer
[38:57] and he Cried Out speak and he struck it
[38:59] expecting the thing to speak back to him
[39:01] because what was in his heart was so
[39:03] real it was so material in front of him
[39:05] and brother bam saw a replica of this on
[39:08] in the Forest loone Cemetery in uh in
[39:10] America and he said to him it was the it
[39:13] was the CU a lot of people say well the
[39:15] mark on the knee is now a floor it's a
[39:17] floored sculpture but the prophet saw
[39:20] that floor and he said to to me to him
[39:22] rather that made it the Masterpiece it
[39:25] wasn't the skill of the sculpture it was
[39:26] the fact that the inspiration in the
[39:28] artist became so real that he smote the
[39:31] image amen and it's the same thing now
[39:33] with you know with you and I even just
[39:36] take back to the Lord Jesus see God was
[39:38] remolding he was sculpting the perfect
[39:40] man down through the prophets down
[39:43] through and if you look at the lives of
[39:44] the Believers of the Old Testament they
[39:46] were rugged lives they weren't a flowery
[39:48] bed of EAS They Carried a lot of scars
[39:51] amen now a scar is a testimony a scar is
[39:54] actually a victory if it's given to the
[39:56] Lord amen just like how Joshua would
[39:58] would um I know I'm running out of time
[40:00] but to say very quickly you know Joshua
[40:02] assigned six Cities of Refuge in the Old
[40:04] Testament in the in the promised land
[40:07] many of them were were strongholds of
[40:09] the enemy they were they were cities of
[40:11] the amalekites and different ones but
[40:13] you see Joshua ordained these cities and
[40:16] Caleb took one of them and it became a
[40:18] City of Refuge so so someone who who who
[40:21] did a crime that you know maybe they
[40:24] killed someone by accident or something
[40:25] happened before before the relatives of
[40:28] the one dead or whatever could could
[40:30] avenge against their relative this
[40:32] person could run to the City of Refuge
[40:34] and be safe he could let off the
[40:36] pressure could he g into the City of
[40:37] Refuge so before Israel before Joshua
[40:40] Israelites came into the promised land
[40:43] they were strongholds of the enemy but
[40:45] then when Israel came in they became
[40:47] Cities of Refuge and so it's the same
[40:50] thing with scars in our life they can be
[40:52] a stronghold of the enemy they can be a
[40:56] complex of pain something of the past it
[40:58] can be actually something just like you
[41:00] know you know some people you can say
[41:01] certain things it's like trigger words
[41:03] and it's got something in their past you
[41:04] know nothing about causes this thing
[41:06] just to explode what is that a
[41:08] stronghold as the Bible says pulling
[41:10] down the strongholds of the enemy don't
[41:12] give place to the enemy right but then
[41:15] that same thing can be turned around
[41:17] when God steps in and it can be a City
[41:19] of Refuge in terms of the fact that you
[41:21] can step into someone's burden and pray
[41:23] for them far more than someone else uh
[41:27] who could if they' never been in that
[41:29] kind of experience even as brother Brown
[41:31] would say this about his about his
[41:33] little little daughter Sharon Rose where
[41:36] you know she was um dying in so much
[41:38] pain I'm not going to read it but just
[41:39] to you know save time you know she she
[41:42] she was D she she got in so much pain as
[41:44] a baby her eyes crossed and then he says
[41:48] here I could never stand to see a
[41:50] crosseyed child from then I've never
[41:52] seen one past the platform but that was
[41:55] healed amen is that right I've seen 400
[41:58] and something crossy children healed in
[42:00] 6 months wow why is that because he saw
[42:04] his daughter dying in that Agony now he
[42:07] had a choice he could have become bitter
[42:10] he could have become resentful he could
[42:11] have said why me and this is wrong and
[42:13] that's not fair and God you know this is
[42:15] wrong and I'm mad at you and I'm I'm
[42:17] going to turn my back on you because of
[42:18] what you've allowed happen in my life
[42:20] all these things he had that choice he
[42:22] was a man of like passions like you and
[42:23] I but he gave it to the Lord and the
[42:26] Lord now could use it that when he saw a
[42:28] cross-eyed Child come across a platform
[42:30] his mind went back to when he saw his
[42:32] little little daughter there and he
[42:34] entered into the need and prayed and
[42:37] look at the results my but I doubt very
[42:40] much those parents that had those
[42:41] children knew the suffering and the pain
[42:43] that caused that hurt that scar in his
[42:46] life for that to happen hallelujah amen
[42:50] so everything works together for our
[42:52] good Romans 8:28 it actually all works
[42:55] together for our good but we're going to
[42:56] let the Lord use it for our good amen
[42:59] blessed because it's the wounding it's
[43:01] the scar there's there's Great Value in
[43:03] the scar so as he said about the
[43:06] Michelangelo here he said he said the
[43:09] the the mark on the knee makes it the
[43:12] Masterpiece amen and it's the same thing
[43:15] with our lord
[43:16] Jesus sure he made that man see he did
[43:21] incredible Miracles he did rais Lazarus
[43:23] from the grave did incredible things but
[43:26] what made him the the Masterpiece is
[43:28] that his wounds brought salvation amen
[43:31] his wounds brought healing his wounds
[43:33] bring Deliverance amen how many times if
[43:36] we can look into the Old Testament and
[43:38] and we draw strength from believer's
[43:40] scars amen we can draw strength from
[43:43] Caleb he was a slave in Egypt but he
[43:45] came out of it he overcame his past he
[43:48] said no God's able to give me the land
[43:50] and to sure doesn't matter where you
[43:51] come out of when God ignites the seed in
[43:54] your soul by his word all those things
[43:56] don't matter you go on to the promised
[43:57] land you're going to take your
[43:58] inheritance amen you see Rahab she you
[44:01] know brother Braham says that it was
[44:02] actually her parents put her into
[44:04] prostitution but then when the when the
[44:07] spies came away the the the token came
[44:09] on display of that Scarlet rope I mean
[44:12] we can draw strength from that you say
[44:13] here's a woman who came out of a broken
[44:15] life a broken home a broken upbringing
[44:18] but Grace came into her life amen and
[44:20] salvation came into her home so if she
[44:23] can come out of that mess amen I'm I'm
[44:25] going to be okay amen Hallelujah you
[44:28] look at Tamar you look at Ruth you look
[44:29] at Rahab you know you can take even
[44:32] David and the credible things he went
[44:33] through to get on the throne if David
[44:36] can go through those things my God is
[44:38] the same as David's God Amen we can we
[44:41] can make it through amen Noah and all
[44:43] the trouble he had and you know you can
[44:45] just look at all the all of them y amen
[44:48] we draw strength in them don't don't we
[44:50] the woman at the well we draw strength
[44:51] from her testimony Peter James and John
[44:54] and and Paul we draw strength from them
[44:56] do we not amen why CU there's value in
[44:58] their scars amen they're powerful they
[45:00] have they have impact thousands of years
[45:03] after they were alive those scars are
[45:05] still speaking I mean those star scars
[45:08] still have an impact I trust they have
[45:10] have impacted you I mean you read the
[45:12] Bible you read about Isaiah and
[45:14] different ones the things they had to
[45:15] endure you say Thank You Lord does it
[45:18] not encourage you does it not give you
[45:20] strength does it not give you courage
[45:22] amen why because there's value in their
[45:24] scars there's value in their testimony
[45:26] amen that's same thing now especially
[45:28] with our lord Jesus because his scars
[45:29] brought eternal life his wounding
[45:31] brought eternal life amen he was mared
[45:34] more than any man and what kind of
[45:36] strength do we draw out of those scars
[45:38] amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost I me
[45:40] we're going to draw the Rapture out of
[45:41] the valley of those scars am because he
[45:43] purchased the translation of our bodies
[45:45] that day on Calvary amen we can draw
[45:48] healing amen we can draw prodal coming
[45:50] home we can draw the dead raising we can
[45:52] draw all the gifts in the church amen we
[45:55] can draw amen a placed her position in
[45:58] the word amen we can draw all things
[46:00] because of those scars so that depends
[46:02] what you value amen so you can value
[46:05] either negative things happening or you
[46:07] can give it to the Lord and it and then
[46:09] you can really value it thank you Lord
[46:11] you want to use my past you want to use
[46:14] my upbringing you say I've always been
[46:17] been an oddball well then you can
[46:19] understand other odd balls amen yeah
[46:22] praise God you know you could there
[46:24] should be nothing in our past that
[46:26] should Hold Us Down amen if it's if it's
[46:30] not given to the Lord it'll hold you
[46:31] down but if you've really given it to
[46:32] the Lord he said I don't understand Lord
[46:35] but I don't need to understand you'll
[46:37] make it all clear when we get to that
[46:38] other side I mean you'll make me
[46:40] understand it you'll help me you know
[46:41] that way but in the meantime Lord use it
[46:44] for your glory amen the Lord hallelujah
[46:46] because you see now God wants to use he
[46:49] wants to use our scars for a
[46:53] testimony Our Testimony is a testimony
[46:57] amen and as you see it's those who have
[46:59] scars are those who are going to ride in
[47:01] his Chariot yeah now I'm talking about
[47:03] testimony scars or just I mean they're
[47:05] all a testimony right amen you can take
[47:08] the day you born your for even your
[47:09] fourbears getting here is a testimony a
[47:12] lot of our forbears went through Wars
[47:14] went through plagues went through
[47:16] trouble they're here I mean we're here
[47:17] aren't we travel overseas on ships all
[47:20] kind of dangers whatever more we're here
[47:23] God preserve them to bring you here
[47:25] praise the Lord amen so but you see now
[47:29] brother BR would tell a story in
[47:30] conference he's speaking about uh Caesar
[47:33] and Caesar wants to have a Triumph wants
[47:35] to have a a Triumph as a victory parade
[47:38] and so he goes down because because he's
[47:40] going to have his great Jubilee and and
[47:43] he wants one soldier to ride in his
[47:46] Chariot there's only room for one so if
[47:48] you think now here's the opportunity to
[47:51] ride in the Chariot of Caesar not just
[47:53] anyone Caesar like Julius Caesar or one
[47:56] of them right so now all of the soldiers
[47:58] they get their you know armor shining
[48:01] and and and and their plumes pluming and
[48:04] you know all those things I've seen um
[48:06] what is it a trentham there there were
[48:08] the giras there or someone you know the
[48:10] burmes soldiers right and they have
[48:12] their hats and boxes probably fish would
[48:14] know more about this than me but you
[48:15] know they have their hats that are
[48:16] straight actually in like a press to
[48:18] keep it perfectly straight this would
[48:20] have been like this but on steroids
[48:22] because you're going to ride with Caesar
[48:24] okay so the Polish is polished and the
[48:26] you know everything shining and all
[48:28] these things and he's looking he's
[48:30] looking and all the Warriors trim their
[48:32] plumes I'm halfway through this here and
[48:34] polish their Shields and their helmets
[48:35] getting ready to pass by Caesar and to
[48:38] review to see who he would choose to
[48:40] ride with him in this great parade and
[48:42] said all of his Warriors walking
[48:44] perfectly straightly walked by and stood
[48:47] with their salute and said all along
[48:50] Caesar looked at each one as he came by
[48:52] said after a while a little bitty old
[48:55] Soldier crippled up his arm scar all
[48:58] over his face everything walked by and
[49:00] he felt ashamed of himself amen this is
[49:03] see you see a Believer is not proud a
[49:07] Believer doesn't think they deserve
[49:09] anything amen amen amen we don't we
[49:13] don't earn it we don't deserve it but we
[49:15] accept it right and we're thankful amen
[49:18] so here's this little bitty guy all
[49:19] scarred up walking by he felt ashamed of
[49:22] himself he probably thought man my
[49:23] Shield's not as shiny as that one look
[49:26] at my swords bent I got dents in my
[49:27] helmet all these campaigns have been
[49:29] through you know he can't even get half
[49:31] a decent shine on his armor he's
[49:33] probably you know can't even walk
[49:35] straight because of wounds and things
[49:36] he's had in his body and you know he
[49:38] feels ashamed of himself thinking I
[49:39] don't measure up to these other soldiers
[49:42] and he bowed him uh and he kind of bowed
[49:44] his head and started away and Cesar said
[49:46] wait a minute wait a minute there come
[49:48] back here the little soldier walked up
[49:50] and fell on his knees he said yes great
[49:52] emperor said where did you get them
[49:55] scar what you all scarred up about he
[49:58] said I got them in the battlefield
[50:00] fighting for my Emperor he said you sit
[50:02] up here by me you earn the ride he says
[50:04] I don't care whether I'm a DD PhD or a
[50:07] double LD I want some scars to show I've
[50:10] been in the battle amen I want some
[50:13] testimonies you shall been serving my
[50:14] Lord I mean because you think about a
[50:16] soldier serving Caesar as an extension
[50:19] of Caesar performing SE Caesar's will
[50:22] we're going to go invade Britain well
[50:23] we're going to Britain we're going to
[50:24] fight the Cs or whoever's over there
[50:26] we're going we're going here an
[50:27] extension of his will amen and that's
[50:29] what the Bride of Jesus Christ is it's
[50:31] not our will but thy will be done amen
[50:34] so every scar this this Soldier got was
[50:36] because of account of of the orders of
[50:38] Caesar amen but he didn't think he was
[50:40] worth anything to ride in his Chariot
[50:42] and I think that's kind of how we feel
[50:44] don't you think about it friends I mean
[50:46] because we got a chariot you know
[50:47] brother R said when that Chariot came to
[50:48] get Elijah there were chariots hitch to
[50:52] every Bush and and and tree around where
[50:54] Elijah was but it's your chariot there
[50:57] was one for Elijah but there's one
[50:58] waiting for you amen so one day we're
[51:00] going to take a chariot ride amen it's
[51:02] going to be glorious amen but what's
[51:04] going to happen it's going to be scarred
[51:06] veterans that are going to take a
[51:08] chariot ride now we're going to realize
[51:10] that a scar is because of a campaign
[51:13] it's because of a battle no not every
[51:15] one of us are preachers not every one of
[51:16] us are out in the front that doesn't
[51:19] mean we're not going to have scars
[51:21] testimonies right because remember it's
[51:23] the hidden parts of the body that are
[51:25] most valuable Lord amen you ever see
[51:28] someone's heart out of their chest
[51:29] there's a problem it's got to be in the
[51:31] chest beating right your lungs your
[51:33] vital organs you don't see vital organs
[51:35] on the outside of the body right but
[51:38] they are the most important ones the
[51:40] ones you never think about until you're
[51:42] sick something's damaged there maybe you
[51:45] got an infection in your lungs
[51:47] something's wrong with your heart I
[51:48] don't know but something you never
[51:50] normally think about but when that thing
[51:51] is is injured the whole body's affected
[51:55] more than maybe something on the outside
[51:57] amen if you break a you break a little
[51:59] bone in your little toe you know about
[52:01] it oh yeah that Bone's fine you don't
[52:03] even know you you forget your toes there
[52:05] half the time right and it can be like
[52:07] parts of the body of Christ the hidden
[52:09] parts are the most valuable
[52:11] ones amen so never think that no one's
[52:14] important everyone's important brother
[52:16] Ram says the success of his meetings is
[52:18] because of people praying with their
[52:20] names ever in lights or posters no but
[52:23] the success of his meetings was people
[52:26] praying
[52:27] now I just want to finish with this cuz
[52:29] this this scripture I'm kind of seu but
[52:31] this scripture I I read it a few days
[52:33] ago it's just been on my mind so much
[52:36] you know it's amazing when when Paul
[52:37] would list Believers at the end of
[52:40] Epistles and you know they weren't the
[52:42] only Believers around but for some
[52:44] reason the Lord inspired him to to to
[52:47] speak of of of certain Believers and
[52:50] this and this brother uh ephus however
[52:53] you say it who is one of you a servant
[52:55] of Christ saluteth you always laboring
[52:59] fervently for you in prayers that you
[53:01] may stand perfect and complete in all
[53:05] the will of God wouldn't that be an
[53:07] incredible testimony to have oh yeah
[53:10] wouldn't that be an incredible you know
[53:12] if if if if God could write two verses
[53:15] about
[53:16] you wouldn't that be the
[53:19] desire that you that that that you may
[53:21] stand perfect and complete in all the
[53:23] will of God wouldn't that be what you
[53:25] would want to be known for why you're
[53:28] part of the body why you encourage one
[53:30] another why you pray for one another why
[53:32] you exalt and share scriptures and songs
[53:35] and testimonies and and you and messages
[53:38] the whole thrust of your life is that
[53:40] the rest of the body of Christ would
[53:42] stand perfect and complete in all the
[53:44] will of God isn't that powerful I think
[53:47] ephis is going to have a chariot
[53:50] ride amen I believe he's going to be one
[53:52] of the great Heroes of Faith was he
[53:54] known very much in his day well apart
[53:56] from this writing I doubt very much was
[53:59] he a minister there's no record of him
[54:00] being a minister was he a pastor
[54:01] evangelist Prophet teacher there's no
[54:03] record of that but the burden of his
[54:06] life is that the Saints would stand
[54:07] perfect and complete in all the will of
[54:10] godall amen and I pray to God that this
[54:13] becomes our desire amen that when we
[54:16] pray when we pray for one another when
[54:18] we you know we never go to God with a
[54:20] selfish motive when ever come to God
[54:22] with some kind
[54:23] of staty I'm better than next fell
[54:26] that's why I'm praying for them kind of
[54:28] thing no but our but our but our thrust
[54:30] of our prayer should be Lord may may my
[54:32] brother may my sister may they stand
[54:34] perfect may they stand in maturity amen
[54:37] stand in completeness not a baby tossed
[54:39] to and fro with every wind of Doctrine
[54:41] but they know in whom they have believed
[54:43] am me they walk with God no matter
[54:44] what's going on they're always rejoicing
[54:46] even in the trial God help me to be like
[54:48] that amen and and complete in all the
[54:51] will of God what is God's will his word
[54:53] amen not just fulfilling one part
[54:55] they're fulfilling the whole part amen I
[54:57] think this should be the thrust of our
[55:00] life amen amen you may not be a prayer
[55:03] Warrior but hey you can pray amen but
[55:06] you know it's so I doubt very much that
[55:08] that people would have known about him
[55:10] until this and maybe when he read this
[55:13] read this letter he thought Paul why did
[55:15] you have to put my name in
[55:17] there you know because it's like the
[55:19] soldier who felt as shame coming before
[55:21] Caesar he didn't March up say that's my
[55:24] that's my ride I just deserve it look at
[55:26] all mcars look at the battles have been

[55:34] barbarians no see a real a real
[55:37] Christian walks in humility does not
[55:40] think they're anything amen they know
[55:42] God's everything all they care about is
[55:43] him living and I you know I believe
[55:46] ephis would have been that kind of a
[55:48] brother you know probably even
[55:50] embarrassed at his name's there why' you
[55:52] have to tell them about me like this and
[55:54] but you see this is how we should be yes
