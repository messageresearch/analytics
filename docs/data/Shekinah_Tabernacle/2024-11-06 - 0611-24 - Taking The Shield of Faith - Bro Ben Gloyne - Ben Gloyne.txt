your am [Music] how about that is that good hi okay sorry um let's turn to uh Ephesians chapter 6 and we're going to start reading from verse uh 11 here says here maybe we'll start from verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your learn loins GT about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherein you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight almighty God truly Lord Jesus We Want To Praise You Lord give you praise du unto your name thank you we could gather this night here we thank you that we could read your word together and Lord we know as anyone can read it but it takes you the Great Divine author to step in Lord anoint your word not just to speaker but to hear us so may you anoint all of us father as we uh Lord sit at your table tonight may you feed us from that hidden manner of your word and may you Lord Jesus be with everyone who's streaming tonight as well we thank you father for this Grand opportunity we love you Lord we ask your blood would cover us and may you have preeminence in our lives For Your Glory take control now Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen friends you can you can have your seats tonight so I want to um I want to talk about now I'm probably going to start I know I've said this before but I want to go into a series if I may we'll see how this goes but I want to talk about the effect of spirits upon ourselves and the and Spirits upon one another upon on our families different things and particularly jealousy pride and unthankfulness so I'm going to maybe lay a bit of a foundation tonight and you see how we go and just want to speak about how they affect the individual the family and those that they are targeted against now we read in the scripture that we need to put on the whole armor of God right we we are standing in the evil day that we the Apostle Paul when he prophesied when he was writing this to the Ephesians he was he was inspired to write this but uh to them but to me it's to us in this day because this is a very evil day that we live in right so um as we read I just want to keep your attention to to verse 16 how it says above all taking the shield of Faith wherein you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked so uh as we read there it said take the helmet take the breastplate take all these things but then when the Apostle Paul comes down he's inspired to speak about the shield of Faith he says above all take that Shield of Faith because the shield of Faith or the shield if you look at that armor is the only thing that the actually the bearer either raises or lowers it's up to the individual how they use this right so we got so I want to speak about what the shield of faith is what the fiery darts of the enemy are which ties into spirits and then also how to quench every fiery Dart of the wicked because he said here that ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked okay so this is where we're just going to go a bit of a Sunday school lesson tonight because you know there's a lot of Spirits running rampant in this day but we have the power by the whole armor of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to quench all of them right they can't hit us so we can block them all okay doesn't mean we won't feel them but we well well okay let's just have the sermon then go home in two seconds right a thought will come a spirit is trying to take dominion over you okay you can either agree with it and let it hit you or you can by Revelation withstand take take the revelation of the word and disagree with that thing and then you block it right it's like fear I mean I got it way down on my notes but just just so know where I'm going tonight you this is not a mystery tour okay the words come open everything's made real today right see so it's like when chrisy and I were living in freckleton Grove here there was that evil spirit uh in the house right fell a real oppression and we were fighting and all these things and but you know we knew there was a spirit that Christian even saw the form of it and everything and one night we were praying against it and I felt this real fear come upon me now that's a fiery Dart okay so I could I so I was feeling fear it was a real fear now I had a choice I could either raise my shield of Faith because what is that Revelation that God has not given us a spirit of fear but Power love and a sound mind that I have dominion over that thing because remember the blood of Jesus Christ has loosed Adam's Fallen race to restore us back to dominion over every Spirit right we have dominion over every fiery doubt of the enemy so I could either accept that fear and let it rule me and say oh no you this is terrible this is scary this a you know I can't withstand this thing or I could of which I did rebuke that thing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and what quench that fiery D amen so so okay when you go home you're dismissed okay but that's basically what I'm going to it's very simple because the gospel is simple right but we just want to go into these things now we know that human uh uh that humans Are Spiritual Beings we're more we're more spiritual than I think we even realize and that's irrespective of a Believer or not we're all Spiritual Beings now the spirits we carry affect not just ourselves but also our family our workmates the colleagues classmates whoever is the spirit we carry affects people it either will will bring pain and hurt or it will bring love and joy and Reconciliation right so we got to be very careful that we when we realize when when a when a spirit is attacking you're dominating us it's hurting not just you but other people around us now and and so what happens is because spirits that people carry they want to dominate they want to project their influence onto others and we can see that in the political world there's a we know there's an election going on right now in America they're counting up the votes and we know whoever gets in red or blue God is allowed it amen God's plan will be fulfilled so don't get upset or if it's if it's Trump or Harris hey praise God whatever he wants he's going to get it in there but you see there but it's political you know it's it's spirit's projecting and you can see people who have strong personalities is actually that their human Spirit wanting to dominate others all right are you following me so far I hope this is okay so now like brother brah he'd be in a prayer line and and and he'd have someone come in front of um him I'll just read this shall I he says now you're conscious you're in the presence of something besides your brother a feeling of knowing that there's something near you you're a Christian I see you're a Christian it's turning real light around you that means that your spirit is welcoming me you're not a Critic you're here you you've come for help I don't know you but something is near you and that very thing you feel that real sweet humble like spirit is that true raise your hand to your friends if that's true can't you see that people between me and the woman that light moving whipping around that's the Holy Spirit see you don't see it perhaps yourself but your spirit lets you know that it's there now that's the thing that heals you not me it's your faith in him but you've to be pray prayed for and I don't know what your trouble is but he can tell me see and then he goes down how she's nervous she's got kidney trouble and all these different things but the point of it is that that she had a welcoming spirit and brother R would say in another place is a different message uh what is what here is there Elijah says the the woman is a Christian because from her comes a real a feeling of friendship her spirit that's in her is welcoming the spirit that's in me so now I doubt very much that these two sisters when they got up and they going to go to the meeting that they're going to that they woke up saying I'm going to be welcoming today you know that that they didn't consciously say I'm going to have a welcoming Spirit I'm going to you know but it was an atmosphere it was a life within them that made a welcoming atmosphere around them that when they stood before the prophet there wasn't a resistance there wasn't something pushing back against the Lord in him but there was a welcoming there was a drawing power going on Amen so like you can e so it's the atmosphere that They carried by the anointing within them caused that atmosph ere to to come out of them why because we're all Spiritual Beings what the atmosphere that we carry influences everyone around us you even like you take brother kin or brother ID you know I doubt very much I haven't asked brother ID about this but I doubt very much before they come to church that they look in the mirror saying be welcoming be welcoming to everyone you know shake their hand with a real love or a hug to the brothers you know no it's the atmosphere they carry just projects that now that's not shouldn't shock anyone you see but you see it's the anointing that makes gives that welcoming presence you know brother Bram would say that you know he says and people here tonight he says God is depending on you to project his love to The Sinner there's something about a man or a woman you're a miniature Creator have you ever seen people that you love to be around it's the see have you um it's the atmosphere they carry around them others nice people they but you just can't stand to be around them they create they create that by the way they live and the way they think it's the little atmosphere you live in so people create an atmosphere around them by the spirit that they're projecting and brother R says it's by the way they live and the way they think because what are thoughts thoughts are are inspiration right either from Satan or from God that's what thoughts are it depends what you agree with have you ever been some you know been around someone who's always negative always down never looks the glass is not even half full it's just empty there's a hole in it it's just draining out everything's wrong nothing goes right what that there's an atmosphere being projected from them I mean they may not ever say anything but you know they're under a thundercloud right why because there an atmosphere that's being projected from them and it wants to take influence Over You So by the so that's why we should always think positive we should always think positive if God is for me who can be against me no weapon formed against me shall prosper amen I Am Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ I am his child amen he has my best interest in mind amen I cannot lose because he's ordained I'm going to win amen you say well how you going to get out of this trial I don't know but he led me in it he's going to lead me through it I'm going to come out the other side packing the victory because he's my God you see you create that kind of atmosphere around you it's an atmosphere of faith it doesn't weaken Faith No it builds Faith amen but you see you see the worst thing brother Braham says here um he says the most horriblest thing is to see a man or a woman that's constantly complaining I've always thought God keep me from from that see that weakens Faith all the time we never want to get into that condition someone who's constantly complaining you see even he says this I always thought God keep me from it weakens Faith all the time you know I know as you get older each one of us we're going to uh we're going to get something happen and something happen and know those little things are going to keep accumulating that as you get older they just got to what is that experiences of life but they'll either make you better or bitter your choice your choice see two people can be in the same conditions raised in the same home go through the exactly the same things and one can be rejoicing happy praising God and the other one can be negative bitter against what happened they they experienced the same things right but one chose to say no God allowed that I saw God's hand in that God's always been with me the other one's like well where was God if he's real he should have been there and he was there the whole time you see so we should never we should never be complaining it weakens Faith right so and I'm not saying we're a bunch of complainers but you to see there's power in the atmosphere we project and we should never let those kind of atmospheres rule us we need to discern it and withstand it right if someone is always nagging and constantly complaining and down you realize it's not them it's the atmosphere they carry right if you could strip that away they'd be rejoicing you see so you got to you can't let those darts hit you now he says he says but I think one of the most horriblest things is for Satan to Crown some person's life a crabbit old man or an old woman you see I hope I don't get to that place I hope that I can bear up my burdens and get to a spot where I want my life to be crowned with the glory of God his longsuffering gentleness peace meekness and filled with the Holy Ghost amen you see so complaining is actually what is that it's actually unbelief because it weakens Faith that's that's an atmosphere of unbelief that that comes out of a person they're not even necessarily conscious that they have it they can be a believer they can be baptized right away they can you know a message believer but they can be such an atmosphere of unbelief permeating permeating from them and they but they think they're actually fine they think well I'm just being Discerning or I'm just you I can justify my actions no we can't complain Jesus went to hell for us our names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life nothing can take our names off his book amen God has restored his truth to us am mean God has done all things for us what do we got to complain about I've got eternal life that's end of complaints bad day good day who cares I know where I'm going really what does it matter you see so even even when you look at the word complaining it comes from the word murmuring where the children of Israel see it says in uh Exodus 16 we know that they murmured a lot they you know they became very used to murmuring and the whole Congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness now this murmuring would not have just started like like one hand it was never murmuring and then next minute everyone's murmuring it would have started from individuals maybe ones of influence because I doubt they murmuring when they walked out of Egypt under the blood of the Lamb I doubt they were murmuring when they crossed the Red Sea they sure were they they sure were not murmuring when they dancing on the other side of the Red Sea and their enemy was dead in the Red Sea right that there was no murmuring there but it started by individuals what happens is like brother Bram says you're big sweet group now but Satan won't let you stay this way he says he'll put someone among you and he'll use that person to to to to shoot poison into the rest of the group he says now don't take sides with it right what is that that's fiery darts of the enemy begin to be shot among Believers now we have a choice just like so so so the murmuring begin to spread and the reason that it hit everyone is because they did not raise their Shield of Faith Joshua and Caleb did Joshua and Caleb did amen because their Shield of Faith now Faith is a revelation right so they had a revelation I have a home Over Yonder over Jordan I've got a mountain I've got a place I've got an inheritance God have you seen it yet no but it's there why because the god that gave the promise is the god who's come down to fulfill that promise and he's carrying me there amen so they had a revelation so they would have felt the complaints hey they they're in the same desert they were thirsty they drank the same bitter Waters of Mara they went through all the same hardship the sand blew into the camp all the th all the trouble they had all those same things affect them but yet they did not let that murmuring Spirit come upon them amen the feelings were all the same the problems were all the same the sand was sure all the same you see but they raised up that Shield of faith that Revelation I'm going to the promised land and they did not let that fiery Dart hit them amen so so we must stop agreeing with the five cent our five senses are actually your enemy right it's your enemy because your five senses are not made to contact God they made to contact this world right faith is made to contact God Amen so we got to stop agreeing with what our five senses declare and start agreeing with the word of God Amen and this word murmured here it actually means to stop it means to Lodge this is in the this is in the Hebrew you it means to stop it means to Grumble complain to you know you know to to murmur so this murmuring caused them to stop in their walk we should always be positive if you want to move forward be positive in God Amen quote him at his word take him at his word don't don't complain about the situation don't stop keep moving forward amen so we shouldn't we shouldn't murmur and complain don't let that Spirit come like it did there and uh hit you now remember if if you've been hit by a firey Dart there's a bom and Gilead we have the best first aid we got the best emergency hospital we got the best specialist the great physician not just a physician the great physician now is here the sympathizing Jesus right so you say look I look like a porcupine I've been hit by so many darts that's fine God can heal them right God can heal them so just because one gets through doesn't mean you're done no we ain't toast we're getting up we're walking on Amen so you see you can either have a welcoming Spirit or you can have a unwelcoming Spirit now Jesus when he went to Nazareth he went to his own country it's says here in Matthew 13 and you know he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they are astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these Mighty works is not this The Carpenter's son is not his mother called Mary and his Brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not with us whence then hath this man all these things so basically we know his family we know what he like when he was a little boy we've seen where he was raised how did he get all these things this and they were offended in him but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief so they didn't have a welcoming Spirit they had an unwelcoming spirit because that spirit will try and keep everything down will try and stop the spirit of God moving it'll try and keep joy out of the camp it'll take Victory away that's what an unwelcoming Spirit does but a welcoming Spirit does the opposite it brings the joy of God down it brings Victory into the camp amen it gives overcoming power Hallelujah you feel like everything's fine we're just going to sail right through this thing amen why because you're welcoming the Lord like brother Bram said if you want to see deity in your midst welcome and receive the word that's why he said if you want to see deity Jesus Christ himself in your midst then welcome and receive his word have a welcoming Spirit to his word it may it may that may thrash you tear you tear your hide off your back you say I welcome you Lord amen amen praise the Lord amen it it would even say when Jesus was standing in front of standing in front of um pilate I'm just giving you a few illustrations before we kind of break this down here you know Jesus was standing in front of pilate and um it says in Matthew 27 he said therefore when they were gathered gathered together pilot said unto them whom will will ye that I release unto you barabus or Jesus called Christ for he knew that for Envy which is jealousy they delivered him so they be they were jealous isn't this crazy but but this is this is what this is what these you know jealousy and and these things do it makes people reject the very Messiah that was sent to them you think they were je now to me this sounds crazy their King they were jealous of their own King think about it they were jealous of the one who who could come the only one who could come and redeem them to wash them of their sins the all the promises of the Old Testament that no doubt they sat around they learned they memorized they debated they discussed they knew all the prophecies concerning him but yet when he came when those prophecies became flesh they became jealous of the thing and they would rather have barabus a murderer but basically a jealous spirit will take anything just to destroy the truth doesn't matter how ridiculous it is how crazy it is they would rather they would rather take anything as long as it's not Jesus as long as he dies as long as the person that they're jealous against dies and and and we know it's not just to kill someone is not just to physically kill them you can kill their influence you can murder their influence that's that's the same as stabbing someone in the back brother Braham says right you see so a jealous person would rather no one gets anything than anyone get something now there was a case when King Solomon uh had before him of two women came before him they both had children one had died in the night and they were debating uh who was uh who was the mother of the living child now I'm sure you know the story well you know then so there they come before King Solomon they both give their testimony and then King Solomon says okay bring me a sword so God brings him a sword he says okay what we'll do because we can't come to an agreement whose baby is whose so I'm going to cut the baby in half and you can each have half so the one the one who was jealous would rather the baby be dead because she was jealous why did my child die this is not fair this is a this is not just we both had children in the same house why did mine have to die it's because she was jealous she wasn't happy sure she would have been heartbroken her baby died but could she not be happy at least the other woman's got a child you see so she would rather she would rather the baby be dead that the both babies are dead then then then there be one living child so we know that the one who who who um you know lost the baby so the baby that was dead she was not the mother of the baby that was there that's how Solomon because the one who um you know the one who had the baby that didn't die she said look just give her to the other woman because she wasn't jealous she look as long as life is preserved I'm willing to suffer great loss it's a son here this is a b there a child there a big deal I'd rather suffer this loss than than than we you know all the babies are dead you say well jealousy is an insane thing it's a spirit it's a real spirit so in Papa New Guinea it's probably the most jealous country I've ever seen in my life we know people I know people where they where they said to the Village they said look we're going to have a we're going to start a pig farm pigs are a big deal over there it's like currency you know it's a big deal he said we're going to start a pig farm and the whole village is going to benefit from this pig farm do you think do you think the family members and and now their Villages are all family right do you think the other parts of the village were happy that that that one of their own was going to make this pig farm that they're all going to benefit from no one night they burnt down the pig farm killed all the pigs people in his own village cuz they were jealous of of what their family member was doing but yet it was going to it was benefiting them but you see that's what jealousy does it would rather see everything in smok and Ashes than one person benefit and we're going to go into this and and and um further maybe Sunday we'll see but you see jealousy jealousy came comes from Satan it come it comes directly straight out of Satan he says now brother says in the mark of the beast and the Seal of God now we find out that because Cain listened to the enemy then what happened he became the first murderer he became the first one that had Jealousy on the earth tell me we in that Pure Line of God to Adam that's the only connection Adam was the Son of God the Bible said so then where did that Y come from where did that murderer come from where did all that kind of a Spirit come from out of Adam couldn't have came from Satan it's exactly where it come from now we find out he was the first murderer he was the first one to have jealousy as Lucifer got jealous of Michael brought it right down to earth and transferred it into man so you got to realize that atmospheres bad atmospheres that people carry they come from Satan they come from hell it's not a bad day it's not a oh I'm just feeling a no no bad atmospheres are not God sent amen and it's not our inheritance to carry a bad atmosphere jealousy you know you know um unthankfulness Pride whatever it is those things do not belong to any man woman or child but you see demons they've always wanted to dominate they've always wanted to dominate Satan and his demons have always wanted to dominate humanity and be worshiped as God so they want to rule the lives of people and cause them to surrender or bow down or let themselves be governed by them you got to realize there's a lot of churches walking around today people that worship Spirits they bow down they give obstinance they let that thing rule their lives the only Spirit that's to govern us is the Holy Ghost himself amen it's not jealousy it's not some something mind battles or some conflix something we're not ordained to carry those things we're not ordain to let those things rule us we're called to rule them amen that we don't bow down to them but they're under our feet that's where they belong to be amen that's where they should be but you see it's Spirits trying to project themselves onto others in order to rule I mean so for example you take a lust Spirit right what is that that Spirit wants to dominate right it wants to It Wants to Rule someone and that spirit will uh that is in a person will want to dominate someone else that's what it wants so what does it do it projects itself onto a potential victim right so so what happens now is the victim begins to get a Vibe that's difference between lust and liking so we understand but the devil always perverts what God has already given right attraction is God given lust is Hell given it's a perversion right but you see that lust Spirit tries to project itself on a potential victim by giving a Vibe so what is that that's a fiery doubt that's been fired at someone right see see quenching the fire darts the enemy we don't literally carry a shield around you don't literally see a with a bow and arrow pop out the bushes and say I'm going to get you no it comes out of other human beings right so now that Spirit projects itself now that victim has a choice they will feel that Vibe they'll feel that attraction now they can either agree with it and be hit by it or they can hold up their Shield of faith and say no this is not god-given I'm not going to emotionally be connected to this person right praise the Lord right so it's vital that we guard our hearts our emotions and we don't get emotionally entangled with someone when we're not cting or or not engaged right but you see those Spirits are rampant around the world yes I know this is nothing strange or new to anyone but you see the Apostle Paul told us we must above all pick up that pick up that Shield that Shield of of Faith now as I said in the very beginning I'm probably kind of coming around in a full circle right now but you see now that Shield is the only piece of armor that the bearer moves if you got the helmet on it's on you got the breastplate on it's on right you don't have to do anything you're wearing it right you good around the loins with truth it's on you your feet shod with the preparation your gospel of peace it's on right but the shield you either raise it or you lower it you got that choice see you know you see I don't know if you ever seen people who Reen medieval battles you know these people with firing arrows and stuff that you know you the foot or the knights they raise their Shields when they know arrows are coming right when arrows aren't coming they lower the shield when a sword's coming their way they raise their Shield up you know so so if someone if someone gets hit by an arrow because they got their shield down whose fault is the that's the person carrying the shield right there's nothing wrong with The Shield The Shield's perfectly fine it it's built to do what it does and it does what it's built to do right it works amen but if the Warrior puts it down and gets hit by an arrow it's not The Shield's fault it's the one bearing The Shield so we have a choice just like a just like a you know a soldier back in you know the Middle Ages or whenever you know back in even Jesus's day we have a choice whether to raise our Shield or to lower our Shield amen cuz just like in the natural the same thing happens in the Supernatural now we know that the whole armor of God is Supernatural right the whole armor of God is Supernatural the whole Armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right it is the word of God made manifest that's what the armor of God is amen and every Christian that has the Holy Ghost is fully armored we're fully equipped for the battle we're fully equipped from from this day till the Rapture we're dressed to fight we're dressed to win amen we are dressed to overcome you don't need any more weapons he gave you the best weapons he gave you the best armor amen he gave you the best equipment that can ever be devised he's already given it to us amen so now the whole armor of God is Supernatural amen so how can people say they believe in a supernatural God and preach the gospel I mean you know but they say they don't believe in those things when the whole armor of God of full armor of Christianity is Supernatural he says what is the armor of Christianity love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness Faith the holy spirit all these things are Supernatural what is love what is Joy go down to the drugstore buy me a quarter worth of it I need it right now see you can't buy love joy peace long suffering goodness patience Generous Faith you can't buy it it's supernatural and the whole armor of the Christian is Supernatural and we're bidden by the scriptures to put on the whole armor of God to be GED about the whole armor and we're equipped with it amen how's everyone tonight is everyone okay amen trust we're all good I I'm good okay we're all good praise the Lord so you say well how do you how do you how do you raise that Shield of Faith then well as I said in the very beginning what do you you agreeing with see you got to discern the thoughts and the feelings that come into your life see some people some people you know they've had such a feeling of offense against someone but yet they found out the truth of the matter is completely different to how they were feeling but when they were told the truth they say well the feeling was so real I'm going with the feeling that is a bad idea right we must always no matter how we feel if our feelings are contrary to the truth we discard our feelings we only we only agree with the five senses when the five senses agree with faith amen if it's contrary we put it aside if it's contrary to the word we put it all aside doesn't matter how we feel that's why we don't go by feeling see it's a fiery Dart the devil fires dart at you you're never going to overcome this thing's always going to plague you you're always going to have this problem now you can either raise that Shield of faith faith is a revelation see even the Revelation Jesus died for you that's a great Shield amen that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for your soul amen and it's going to pack you to Glory that's a perfect Shield to raise up amen because he died for you because you're his child amen he cares for you with an unfailing love amen you are his and nothing can pluck you out of his hand amen cuz why God is jealous over his church amen you know we talk about Mama beers what about Papa beer a what about Papa Bear he's far more frightening than mama bear I mean cuz Papa Bear ceded the sun moon and stars and everything here amen and he's defeated the devil that down Calvary and if when the devil is turned tries to come against you he's got Jesus Christ on his hands hallelujah thank you Lord amen so now so always you see you got to think now what do you agree with if you agree with that thought youve put your shield down if you raise that shield and say no I'm not bowing to this you've raised your shield and your Shield will quench that fiery Dart amen see it's the revelation of the word is your Shield we must always agree with the word you may say well I don't know the scripture very well you don't have to quote scripture and verse perfectly amen as I said just it's just enough to realize Jesus Paid It All amen you're his child amen his blood is more than enough amen so for example someone is jealous we've all come across jealous people it's an atmosphere they carry I talked about those guys in Papa New Guinea They Carried an atmosphere very jealous T poppy syndrome here is child's PL caned there as I said right because it's a very jealous place and so jealousy is all over the world because what was in Satan is now upon the Earth right so someone who's jealous what happens it actually projects a force just like a welcoming Spirit what is that that's a love of God being projected right it's actually a force that comes out of people see that's why brother said I feel a welcoming Spirits there's a weling spirit in that person that was being projected to the prophet right like we read earlier in that quote God is relying on you to project his love to The Sinner right so there's a so the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that the believer carries has a force in it right it's not just some vacant nice idea but there's a power in it amen and and so the holy ghost has a supreme power so so evil spirits have power and jealousy is one that that that certainly has a power and it will fire a fiery Dart against you what does it try and make you feel guilty of what you have that's a fiery Dart of jealousy it can be it can be guilty over the car you drive anything cuz jealousy Compares and if it's not the same as you then it becomes angry and of wanting to destroy you trying to rob the joy of what you have you got a great family someone who's jealous will be angry at you you'll feel it from them it'll try and drag you down that you can't enjoy what God has given we just got to get it straight we all have a different Journey we all have a different allotment in life and God doesn't have have favorites God don't have a favorite child we are all the same you know I can say I have a favorite son because I've got one it's a it's very easy and I've got my favorite analy my favorite Lilia my favorite Gabriella what about my favorite daughter I don't have one I got a favorite analy a favorite Lily or a favorite Gabriela I got a favorite son though because I've got one of them you see but with God he's got many sons and daughters but we're all on the same level with him he don't have favorites right but jealousy is a fallen because it's a fallen angel it wants you to compare one to another and be angry and resentful of someone appears to be doing better than you if you're under the blood of Jesus Christ can I just can I just tell you a little secret if you know him you've won the game of Life You've Won You've Won okay honestly You've Won like brother BR said he could go hunting and fishing for every day for the rest of his life wouldn't wouldn't harm a Salvation none okay so if you really know him You've Won amen praise God okay you've won it's done you can just enjoy life just just go rejoice and walk in walk in his goodness walk in his word enjoy him until he takes you home good days bad days whatever days walk with him in those things see but jealousy will try and make you feel guilty and what is that that now that jealous spirit is trying to is not trying to make you jealous it's trying to make you feel guilty of what that spirit is jealous over okay so so so that that is it trying to have dominion trying to rule you you'll feel guilty you you actually feel the feeling right just because you feel the feeling doesn't mean it's that that D has hit you okay because it's always you know it's like the um Israelis with their Iron Dome and stuff right Hamas or whoever fires a rocket okay the fire dart's coming the senses and the radar and everything in the Israeli side will sense it that it's there right and they know it's really there it hasn't hit them yet this thing is going to detect this thing and it's going to fire a proper counter measure and it's going to blow up okay so the same thing jealousy is projected against you you feel guilty for whatever thing or you know there's Pride or anything tries to come and Rule your life from someone now that's like the Iron Dome detecting an enemy missile right now what are you going to see see sometimes we think oh I feel bad I feel guilty something must be wrong with me no you actually your your radar system of the whole Holy Ghost has detected incoming fiery darts right so now what you need to do is you like if you agree with that thing well yes I I guess I shouldn't be happy I have this I guess you know I should because because you know it's more spiritual to be you know lonely and you know Meek and you know not to get happy you know no but that's what a spirit wants to dominate it doesn't want you to be happy any spirit that doesn't want you to be happy is not the Holy Ghost brother I said God wants us to be happy he wants us to be at peace he wants us to enjoy life not talking about going to the world but like we got life more abundantly yes sir right so so these things want to want to want to make us feel that you know sorry for ourselves that we have what we have I don't feel sorry for what I have I've got eternal life I do not feel sorry I have eternal life not for a second I'm just happy GL amen but you see jealousy will try and make you feel guilty for whatever God has given you that's why I said if God made everyone a billionaire and in here and no one shared nothing with me I'd be happy for you amen if God just gave you the best whatever whatever I'd be happy for you would you be jealous no I'd just be happy for you enjoy that praise God show me what it can do you got the best hyper car in existence can I just sit can I just look at it whatever you know I won't be jeal oh that's not fair no praise God praise God God moved in your home praise praise God Amen God filled your children with the Holy Ghost praise God Amen God healed you praise God Amen God gave you answers to prayer praise God I just be happy for those things you don't get jealous oh what about me no praise God Amen if you want God to move in your life be happy when he moves in someone else's life amen let's not be now I'm not saying you're jealous people you know but we got to be Discerning because these things when you know when Paul was writing these things it wasn't some some vague thing it's a reality so so you feel guilty now you can either raise up the shield of Faith right and by Revelation quench that fiery Dart amen or you can agree with it so what happens like so for example you there's an enemy rocket coming the Israeli radar says there there's a rocket if the radar agrees with the rocket the Rocket's going to hit right it's the same thing with you if you agree with that thing well yeah actually I should feel guilty I should feel bad that I have this that's agreeing with that spirit that that spirit will actually take dominion over you are you with me class you see so you got to discern and withstand the spirit see if people are jealous over you say well no you raise a shield of Revelation this is the walk God has given me if he if he's given me the best family praise God we all have the best families we all have the best spouses for us amen that it should have been a lot harder than that because we're all individuals in God God is not a cookie cutter the Lord amen you like brother Ram said you know he used to think before he went past a CT in a time that you know when we died we' sit up there on the on the clouds and all play Harps he said then the MU musicians would all have it over us but God is not a cookie cutter we all have different you say well why do I have to have this kind of a father why I have this kind of mother why this kind of whatever God God pre-planned your life because there's a certain expression that he wanted out of your life am mean we can't all Express sure we're all the bride of Christ but there's different things we go through because God wants to prove through his body that it doesn't matter where he puts us we'll come out Victorious amen so your testimony will not be my testimony my testimony will not be your testimony but not one testimony is greater than the other amen cuz because the conclusion of all will be Lord it was all you it wasn't me how rich poor smart dumb fat thin tall short whatever it wasn't any of those things that got me here you got me here by your grace hallelujah amen so friends never ever agree never feel guilty because God has given you something that's a spirit trying to beat you down you got to raise that Shield of Revelation and quench that Dart praise the Lord you say well then how do I you say I know where the missiles are coming from what do I do do I take the word and cut that person's head off do I give them a real balling out put them under a a lamp and sit them down and say you listen here you and is that what you do no remember love love conquers all love conquers all brother I makes a statement here in um the Great Commission he says now he says let me give you if I found Grace in your sight through God you take my words for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing who wants a blessing yes sir I I do I'll be honest I want a blessing bless me Lord I I don't mean that as a joke we all want to be blessed right we don't want to be job on the ash Heep okay sure we want as Revelation but you know we want to be blessed amen when a man has done you wrong see so so you've identified the jealousy is coming from brother sister so and so not here right now whatever you know okay because you'll realize this thing's coming from someone amen now now this doesn't mean we we're like the what gapo or the secret police we're kind of you know not trusting anyone and know but you'll realize along your journey where these darts are being fired from and you may have to hold the shield up a lot against the same darts right cuz we'll quench them all amen but remember there's strength in your arm to hold it up why cuz you just stay in love with the Lord with the Revelation he's poured into your soul that will quench that D amen so he says now okay uh when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong and he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to pray for that person but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder that doesn't mean physically look we need a prayer meeting but stand like you're praying next to him or next to her okay and stand in the presence of God our Father um way of prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother he is justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talk to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man amen you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back to here to Earth again you'll go over to that brother shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he's a rank Sinner and what about a brother that's made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if you take him to the throne of God stand shoulder to- shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him Lord give me the best attitude towards everybody doesn't matter what they've done said thought fight at me whatever may I have the best attitud ude towards them because we have great power to bless or to curse the devil wants to use you to curse people cuz he knows the power you have there's power there's great there's great power in the tongue of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so we got to always speak good about people well don't you know what they did to me and keep doing to me speak good about that person because someone's got to break the cycle you see someone's got to break the cycle where it's tit fortat this person did this I'll do this and I say this cuz I'm Justified someone's got to break it and we live in that season of the breaking of Cycles amen so we and maybe his destination rests upon our our attitude towards him and when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other and the best way to do is pray amen amen so I'm just going to summarize okay the shield of faith is revelation of the word okay to quench the fiery DTS of the enemy what are the fiery darts it's spirit's trying to take dominion over you there thoughts that come into your mind feelings that associate with those thoughts to to quench the fiery Dart is to agree with your Revelation compared to and disagree with the dart yes okay so so like I said for example you feel a fear come upon you that's a dart that's been fired at you you either agree with the fear and let it rule you or you rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ because your Revelation says fear is under my feet God has not given this to me but the spirit of he's not given me the spirit of fear but Power Love In A sound mind right or someone's jealous so you feel guilty over something you can either agree with that guilt and that Dart will hit you or he can raise your Shield of Revelation and quench that fiery Dart okay so that's my summation can we have the musicians please tonight amen see these things are tangible right it's amazing you you think oh the Apostle Paul's just using flowery words no God inspired him directly to speak these things that we could walk in this evil age and quench all all I'm glad it says all cuz even the Iron Dome has a percentage of Misses right everything man is devised as even a shield you know it could be a perfect shield in whatever area you live in I me the time you live in and er could still get through it but the shield we carry Glory it can quench all of them but it's up to you do you agree with your Shield of Faith or do you agree with the dart amen praise the Lord let's stand tonight and um uh let's um oh my someone's got to help me who's got a song Praise Him Praise Him Praise Him in the morning praise him in the in the evening should we
