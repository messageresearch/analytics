[35:41] it's a burden of God amen and God places
[35:44] that burden upon us and then he expects
[35:47] us to move in it and we trust that for

[36:27] and I just trust that that I can say
[36:30] something that would encourage you in
[36:32] your walk with the Lord and well let's
[36:34] just make a statement of faith before

[36:41] going to be healed

[39:30] grace that you have bestowed upon us
[39:32] Lord Lord the least we can do in this
[39:35] service is lift our voice to acknowledge
[39:39] and give praise for what you have done
[39:41] Lord I pray for each one of these
[39:44] precious young people in each one of
[39:47] these precious people that is here that

[39:58] father but we don't know their needs but

[40:02] forever and you do know their needs Lord
[40:04] and and I pray you just speak right to
[40:06] them as a we're go right to their chair
[40:08] move into their life Lord go into their
[40:11] rooms Lord and amen divide Lord asunder

[40:16] spirit Lord and may your word just
[40:19] circumcise the heart Lord and bring to
[40:22] pass Lord the promise of your word
[40:24] father in their lives
[40:25] fill with the Holy Ghost Lord heal them
[40:28] in their bodies and in their spirits
[40:30] father may you bring a great deliverance
[40:32] in this room father and you can begin it
[40:35] tonight Lord it does not have to be a
[40:37] breaking-in period father you can do it
[40:40] right now father for your the mighty God
[40:42] and we love you Lord now we can just
[40:45] commit ourselves to you anoint my lips
[40:47] Lord and 90 years of they here
[40:50] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and
[40:53] amen amen if you're turning your Bibles
[40:56] to the book of Ephesians a second
[40:58] chapter we're going to read a Amen very
[41:01] familiar scripture to you Ephesians 2
[41:08] then we're saying brother Branham said
[41:12] that we don't want to just come to talk
[41:16] about the message isn't that true and
[41:19] and and and and we can all do it we love
[41:22] to talk about the message I mean we love
[41:24] to talk about the various things that
[41:26] we've heard or learned down through the
[41:28] years about the message but that's not
[41:30] enough man he said we must come together
[41:33] to get into it and it's not just a
[41:36] theological discussion and it's not just
[41:39] a history now the reason it's reason
[41:42] amen for many of our young people that
[41:43] amen they they struggle with the message
[41:46] is because it hasn't been made alive yet
[41:47] to them and then it's not a theology
[41:50] it's not a theological discussion this
[41:54] is a living reality or it's not the
[41:56] truth if this message I will just make a
[42:01] challenge if this message cannot deliver
[42:03] you it's the wrong one if this message
[42:09] cannot produce sons and daughters of God
[42:12] it's the wrong message but I'll tell you
[42:15] Satan's come too late to say that it
[42:19] doesn't carve out sons and daughters of
[42:21] God how many say men amen
[42:24] so we've come to get into the message
[42:27] because that message is Christ amen he's
[42:32] the word amen let's go to Ephesians to
[42:34] the first verse you hath he quickened
[42:38] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[42:43] wherein in time past you walked
[42:45] according to the course of this world
[42:48] according to the Prince of the power of
[42:51] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[42:55] the children of disobedience among whom
[42:58] also we all had our conversations in
[43:01] times past
[43:02] in the lusts of our flesh a man and I
[43:06] and I believe that if we should
[43:09] underline that word all there's nobody
[43:12] been exempt from walking according to
[43:14] the lusts of the flesh and that
[43:16] knowledge in itself ought to bring a
[43:18] humility into your life god amen before
[43:22] Amen we can recognize the divinity of
[43:25] God we've got to recognize our humanity
[43:27] in order that the divinity of God can
[43:30] come and move in our humanity amen amen
[43:32] and he said among whom also we all had
[43:38] our conversation in times past and the
[43:40] lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[43:42] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[43:45] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[43:47] even as others but God oh I love that
[43:56] but God you have a question tonight you
[43:59] have a you an injunction in your life
[44:02] but God who is rich say he's rich who is
[44:12] rich in mercy for his great love
[44:16] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[44:19] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[44:23] with Christ by grace you are saved and
[44:26] has raised us up together and has made
[44:28] us sit together in heavenly places in
[44:31] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[44:34] might show the exceeding riches of His
[44:36] grace and his kindness toward us through
[44:38] Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved
[44:41] through faith and that not of yourselves
[44:44] it is the gift of God not of works lest
[44:48] any man should boast for we are his
[44:52] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[44:55] good works which God hath before
[44:59] ordained that we should walk in them may
[45:03] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[45:05] you can be seated this evening
[45:13] I want to take a thought as the Lord
[45:16] latest on my heart for the first service
[45:20] I want to title this we are God's
[45:26] workmanship we are God's workmanship and
[45:32] we know that the book of Ephesians a man
[45:36] is the book of Joshua of the Old
[45:38] Testament and as a prophet told that he
[45:41] says Redemption has two different parts
[45:43] is that right one of the parts is to
[45:46] come out of amen and there's many and
[45:49] then we could all rejoice about coming
[45:51] out we can rejoice about amen the blood
[45:55] has been applied amen and the Lord has
[45:58] delivered us out of darkness and then
[46:00] he's brought us out of Egypt we can
[46:02] rejoice a man at the message of the
[46:05] Cross can you say man we can rejoice
[46:08] Amen that he shed his blood he paid the
[46:11] price
[46:12] Haman the debt has been covered and has
[46:14] been paid we can rejoice in that but
[46:18] that's not all of it because amen it's
[46:20] coming out but there's also Amen you
[46:23] have to go in I mean you cannot be in
[46:26] limbo you cannot dwell in the middle you
[46:28] have to go all the way with him this is
[46:30] not a halfway gospel neither is this a
[46:33] halfway house and God doesn't make
[46:35] halfway Christians neither does he make
[46:38] halfway young people that Amen don't
[46:41] know how to serve the Lord let me tell
[46:42] you we don't have to Amen water down the
[46:45] message in order for you to understand
[46:47] it neither do we have to weaken its
[46:49] power so that we can cater to your youth
[46:51] amen you're very capable this evening of
[46:54] understanding the riches and the depths
[46:57] of the grace of God and then we don't
[47:00] have to entertain you in order to
[47:01] attract you amen God doesn't have to do
[47:05] that amen I mean if our young people can
[47:07] go into the depths of Satan and they can
[47:09] be wrapped up at a young age and alcohol
[47:12] and drugs and get pulled into all kinds
[47:15] of immorality how much more can God take
[47:18] you into the riches and the depths of
[47:21] Jesus Christ and I want you to know
[47:23] that's not just
[47:24] his goal that's his prophecy and it's
[47:27] not just his prophecy he's bringing it
[47:29] to pass but he's got to bring it to pass
[47:31] through somebody raised the name of the
[47:36] Lord hey man so you've got to come out
[47:39] of the world to enter into Christ you
[47:42] can't remain in the world and say that
[47:44] I'm in Christ that's why we have a lot
[47:47] of miserable Christians
[47:49] they've never fully been delivered from
[47:52] the lusts of the flesh
[47:53] amen they may they may be theologically
[47:56] right but amen there's not a delivering
[47:58] power in their life yet for them to
[48:00] recognize amen not just the symbols of
[48:03] the message but the reality of the
[48:05] message to really have genuine faith the
[48:10] Prophet said you must absolutely leave
[48:12] everything that's contrary to the Word
[48:15] of God behind in order to enter into
[48:17] faith leaving behind everything means
[48:20] you have to leave behind your reason you
[48:22] have to leave behind your imaginations
[48:24] you have to leave behind your fantasies
[48:26] you have to leave behind anything Amen
[48:29] that the mind would exalt itself over
[48:31] the Word of God you have to leave it
[48:33] totally behind ami when the Bible said
[48:36] that Abraham staggered not at the
[48:38] present at the at the promise of God but
[48:40] was strong in faith giving praise to God
[48:43] who in considered not his own body a man
[48:46] do you understand that statement that he
[48:49] did not consider his body brother
[48:52] Branham said his body never even entered
[48:54] in to his understanding now when we can
[48:59] get to that kind of place
[49:00] where we have not put our body before
[49:02] the words but we've put the word before
[49:05] the body or begin to find out what
[49:07] deliverance is all about amen and it's
[49:12] not enough to know the will of God God
[49:16] amen
[49:17] Satan will tell you amen yes amen excuse
[49:21] me let me just say it again it's not
[49:22] enough to believe Amen that God can
[49:24] deliver you it's not enough
[49:27] Satan would say yes it's true God can
[49:30] deliver you but it's not for you
[49:33] so you've got to not only know that that
[49:35] power is there but it's the will of God
[49:38] to deliver you by that power how many
[49:41] believe that we serve a powerful God
[49:43] tonight so just bear with me as I read
[49:51] this he said the book of the Ephesians
[49:53] of the Old Testament was Joshua where
[49:55] Moses represented the law it couldn't
[49:58] save anyone
[50:00] amen but grace could and Josh was the
[50:03] same word like Jesus Jehovah Savior and
[50:05] now then we have found that we have come
[50:08] to another Ephesians another Ephesus now
[50:12] we're in our intellectual denominations
[50:16] and so forth thank you my brother and
[50:18] all of our educational programs have
[50:22] come to their Jordan I mean let's not
[50:26] just leave that back there Amen with
[50:29] with Amen the organizations of brother
[50:32] bantams time we understand there was not
[50:33] not message churches formed outside of
[50:36] Jeffersonville Amen that believed Amen
[50:38] what Miliband was preaching but there
[50:40] was no message Church formed now he's
[50:42] saying to those organizations we must
[50:44] leave Amen on organizational ideas we
[50:47] must leave our educational programs well
[50:52] amen we still must believe the same
[50:54] thing today amen the educational
[50:58] programs have come to its Jordan
[51:00] we cannot educate you into this message
[51:06] education will not produce it we have to
[51:14] have an exodus to come out and go into
[51:15] the rapture now the Bible says that we
[51:20] are his workmanship right now
[51:23] revelations once said he has made us
[51:25] kings and priests unto God and his
[51:27] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[51:29] ever and ever he hath made us there are
[51:32] certain truths that we need to emphasize
[51:35] and young people I wanted to say this to
[51:38] you no doubt Amen through the course of
[51:41] these meetings you're going to hear
[51:43] things a man about what you should
[51:45] and and and what you need to avoid and
[51:47] and those things just come in in the
[51:49] course of the preaching of the word even
[51:51] before before any of that has ever said
[51:53] I want you I want to emphasize something
[51:55] to you that God has made us kings and
[51:59] priests and there's no way that I can
[52:03] educate you into that amen there's no
[52:06] way I can rightfully explain it to you
[52:08] it must come by a supernatural
[52:11] experience with God that burns out all
[52:13] the doubt in your life until you know
[52:15] Amen that you have met the person of
[52:18] Jesus Christ and the person was not a
[52:21] doctrine that was preached to you but
[52:23] the person was the reality of a Living
[52:26] God and a supernatural presence are you
[52:30] with me hey man he's just just let me
[52:35] read these things and lay may this
[52:36] foundation I pray you bear with me I
[52:38] know my accent amen is the right one
[52:41] amen and yours is the wrong one he knows
[52:44] like one guy was driving down the road
[52:45] one day they're all the traffic was
[52:47] coming straight at him he called home he
[52:49] says mama everybody's driving the wrong
[52:50] direction
[52:51] hey man well I guess I'm probably the
[52:54] only one here with the wrong accent so I
[52:55] just I hope you can bear with me in my
[52:58] head he hath made us there's certain
[53:00] truths we need to emphasize he hath made
[53:03] us salvation is his doing salvation is
[53:07] of the Lord it is all of grace he
[53:10] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[53:13] for a purpose
[53:14] we are kings we are spiritual kings we
[53:17] will be kings upon the earth with him
[53:20] when he sits on his throne but right now
[53:23] and I want you to say that with me right
[53:26] now say it again
[53:29] right now we are spiritual kings and we
[53:36] reign over a spiritual Kingdom
[53:41] it says in Romans 5:17 if by one man's
[53:45] offense death reigned by one much more
[53:47] they which receive abundance of grace
[53:49] and the gift of righteousness shall
[53:51] reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in
[53:55] Colossians 1:13 who hath delivered us
[53:58] from the power of darkness and hath
[54:01] translated us into the kingdom rate of
[54:03] his dear son right now right now the
[54:08] believer reigns with Christ having
[54:11] dominion over sin over flesh over the
[54:16] world and over the devil right now every
[54:23] believer in this room is in Dominion is
[54:27] in dominion over the devil now of course
[54:32] the devil is not going to want you to
[54:34] know this and he's going to tell you
[54:38] that what brother Danny is saying is
[54:40] getting so far out of your reach you
[54:41] have went too far you've done too much
[54:45] you've you're trapped listen we can have
[54:49] young people here
[54:50] you look godly you look pure but you can
[54:53] be in a trap in your mind a fantasy that
[54:56] keeps you going back to the same dark
[54:58] places and hold you in a place of shame
[55:01] and fear and you're not on you're unable
[55:04] to open up yourself and maybe I'm
[55:06] talking to some of the older ones back
[55:08] there you're unable to open up and aim
[55:10] it and be free to say amen amen I have
[55:13] this thing in my life that's helped me
[55:15] in this place and God wants to sell you
[55:19] tonight
[55:20] everything I say about this I'm not
[55:23] hoping that it will happen to you I
[55:26] don't have new thoughts I don't have new
[55:32] thoughts my blueprints are not pieces of
[55:35] paper like yours
[55:36] my thoughts are real and I dwell with
[55:39] them my thoughts becomes words and those
[55:44] words may linger on the earth but those
[55:46] words then become flesh
[55:49] and everything I've said about you young
[55:51] people and in this message is for every
[55:53] generation and every generation has
[55:55] their chance at the revival of God Amon
[55:58] and you have your chance this evening
[56:00] and I want to tell you don't miss your
[56:01] opportunity for what I'm telling you is
[56:04] not out of reach this is your gospel
[56:06] this is your Jesus Christ this is your
[56:10] deliverance this is your our God set
[56:14] this up God orchestrated this camp God
[56:17] pre-planned your life God knew you would
[56:20] set here and he said it's not out of
[56:23] your reach you with me and I'm yelling
[56:28] too loud for you
[56:33] Amen well I found out the devil has
[56:35] heart hearing sometimes you got to lift
[56:37] your voice a little bit huh well I want
[56:43] him to know his rights he don't have any
[56:45] he has no right over these children he
[56:49] has no right to hold families in bondage
[56:53] he's here to deliver the parents he's
[56:59] here to set them free that they can be
[57:00] the examples that they need to be for
[57:03] their children are you with me
[57:10] well I told the Lord I was gonna be
[57:13] quiet and stately didn't work well with
[57:23] the help of the Lord I want to I want to
[57:26] speak words that will increase your
[57:28] faith I mean this is the opening service
[57:32] we won't say that amen
[57:35] that Amen that your opportunity won't
[57:37] come in the next services Amen but why
[57:40] not just make it this one
[57:45] why not make this your night when Jesus
[57:52] was here Jesus said believe me for the
[57:58] very works sake you know there was a lot
[58:01] of there was a lot of misunderstanding
[58:03] about the Lord's life there are
[58:07] misconceptions of where he was from
[58:10] even his mother's testimony marry a man
[58:15] didn't coincide she had first said that
[58:20] this baby was of the Holy Ghost and then
[58:22] she called Joseph his father when he was
[58:23] 12 years old in a time of stress there
[58:27] was confusion about him the priest a man
[58:30] didn't believe in him they said no
[58:32] prophet rises out of Galilee even but
[58:36] Jesus says you can't believe me believe
[58:40] me for the works sake for the works
[58:44] amen that he did be putting he put
[58:47] emphasis enough this has not works a man
[58:49] of amen in another sense where we just
[58:52] try to do works to please God and we're
[58:54] just even out there doing work after
[58:56] work after work this is not the works
[58:57] that he's talking about he's talking
[58:59] about the very expression of his life
[59:02] amen the very the very character that
[59:05] they are seen on display
[59:07] he said amen he put his illnesses on
[59:09] that I can only do that which my father
[59:12] has showed me I am constrained Amen by
[59:16] the will of my father and then no doubt
[59:18] he could have done more Amen when it
[59:21] come to divine healing he could have
[59:22] healed more crowds he could have showed
[59:24] more but he was constrained by the will
[59:26] of the Father even when he went to the
[59:27] pool of Siloam amen he bypassed much
[59:30] worse case and he went to one to ask him
[59:33] his question what do you want because he
[59:39] was constrained it was the will of the
[59:40] Father that led him to that place and so
[59:43] he emphasized that because the works
[59:46] that he did were ordained of God to
[59:50] inspire faith in him
[59:53] and that's the kind of works we want the
[59:57] works that will inspire faith in God it
[1:00:01] was a great part of his ministry that
[1:00:03] His Holy Spirit in the Apostle Paul said
[1:00:06] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:00:08] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:00:11] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:00:13] them amen
[1:00:15] these works that are in a believers life
[1:00:18] are to inspire faith in God as they
[1:00:21] would show forth that relationship to
[1:00:24] God that Paul described created in him
[1:00:28] so I want to maybe take your mind in a
[1:00:31] direction that works that God is
[1:00:33] ordained for us to do he may never have
[1:00:35] ordained you amen to lay hands on the
[1:00:37] sick and they would recover you say
[1:00:41] brother Danny that's the promise of the
[1:00:43] scripture absolutely is a member in your
[1:00:46] walk amen sometimes and then people get
[1:00:48] discouraged Florence - carrying - a
[1:00:50] brother band said for the man am I
[1:00:51] prayed and prayed and I prayed and I
[1:00:53] prayed Amen I still can't cast out
[1:00:55] Devils and brother BAM said because
[1:00:57] that's not your job
[1:00:58] your job is not to cast out Devils your
[1:01:00] job is to pray you understand so God has
[1:01:06] inspired works that would raise up in
[1:01:08] your life that would show the
[1:01:10] relationship of God as related to you
[1:01:12] and it would be no doubt about it that
[1:01:15] it was God and it wasn't your works
[1:01:17] because we know there's works that Damon
[1:01:19] the Bible said Amen Lord I've done many
[1:01:21] wonderful works in your name and he said
[1:01:23] depart from me I never knew you is that
[1:01:27] true but there's a works that inspire
[1:01:30] faith in God and that's the ones we want
[1:01:34] to talk about amen when it what it means
[1:01:38] to be in Christ is this a mean that when
[1:01:41] you are created and new in Christ Jesus
[1:01:43] it is impossible for God to condemn that
[1:01:46] creation Amen no matter how much you
[1:01:51] want to you can't do it yourself you
[1:01:53] can't even do it yourself tonight you
[1:01:56] may be attracted by the words I speak
[1:01:58] you may be stirred by the words I speak
[1:02:01] but unless God is doing the
[1:02:03] falling and God is doing the drawing you
[1:02:06] will never change but go back to the
[1:02:08] same lifestyles and the same habits that
[1:02:11] you've been in before you came but made
[1:02:15] God's wrong you he says you can't do it
[1:02:20] it's a gift of God so I want to tell you
[1:02:23] I mean when that draw begins on your
[1:02:26] heart understand God gave that to you
[1:02:29] it's the most precious thing and don't
[1:02:33] miss that opportunity of that giving he
[1:02:37] said and all that comes to me he says no
[1:02:39] man can come to me except my father
[1:02:41] draws him and all that comes to me I'll
[1:02:43] give him everlasting life and will raise
[1:02:45] him up at the last day and when God has
[1:02:47] borne you anew by the Holy Spirit he can
[1:02:50] only look upon you as a perfect work
[1:02:53] because he did it himself so when God
[1:02:57] now let's just go back to that again
[1:02:59] when God looks upon you and you're born
[1:03:01] of his spirit even he can only look upon
[1:03:04] you as a perfect work because he did it
[1:03:07] himself and he cannot condemn you for
[1:03:12] you are his workmanship this wouldn't
[1:03:15] mean this is what it means to be his
[1:03:17] workmanship I don't want to be
[1:03:21] identified as a message class or our
[1:03:28] message brand I want to be identified as
[1:03:31] his workmanship
[1:03:36] there's there's all sorts no doubt of
[1:03:39] flavors in this room right now you come
[1:03:41] from all kinds of different brands on
[1:03:43] all kinds of different flavors amen
[1:03:47] I do too no doubt our backgrounds have
[1:03:50] something to do with it but we can't
[1:03:52] help where we came from we can't help
[1:03:55] what we come out of but we can help what
[1:03:59] we do tonight
[1:04:02] Amen so he said Amen I presented you
[1:04:06] through the blood and there is nothing
[1:04:09] wrong with my work
[1:04:11] you are God's workmanship now I just
[1:04:15] want to to give you a little bit of
[1:04:18] advice and that is young people if you
[1:04:24] want to get anything from God
[1:04:26] be real don't watch how somebody else
[1:04:33] cried don't watch how somebody else
[1:04:37] repented you be real before God and you
[1:04:46] come to God and say Lord just as I am
[1:04:51] without one plea be real be what God
[1:05:00] made you to be and don't put on
[1:05:04] something for the benefit of anybody
[1:05:05] else in here don't come if you're gonna
[1:05:09] come to the altar don't come because
[1:05:11] your mom wants you to don't come for any
[1:05:15] other reason but that God has drawed you
[1:05:19] is that Alright
[1:05:22] come to him as you are and let him make
[1:05:26] the difference in your life here's a
[1:05:30] statement in Christ the mystery of God
[1:05:32] revealed that he said many people have
[1:05:34] the wrong conception it has never been
[1:05:36] God's idea to convert people to
[1:05:39] Christianity and to its government
[1:05:45] we make converts to Christianity how
[1:05:49] many people have we baptized and they
[1:05:51] started in the work amen and after a
[1:05:53] while out they go why because sometimes
[1:05:56] they're just converts to your church
[1:05:58] their converts to the fellowship their
[1:06:02] converts to Christianity and then
[1:06:04] they're governed by the church they're
[1:06:06] governed by the rules in the church
[1:06:08] somebody help me but that's not his
[1:06:12] thought are you saying brother Danny are
[1:06:15] you saying there are not to be any rules
[1:06:16] you're gonna come treat here and try to
[1:06:17] smash the churches that's not what I'm
[1:06:19] saying
[1:06:20] but what I'm saying it's not God's
[1:06:21] thought his thought is amen that it
[1:06:26] comes not by a government but by a
[1:06:27] revelation Christ in you as God was in
[1:06:32] Christ Christ in you as God was in
[1:06:36] Christ what God did in Christ Christ
[1:06:40] does in you what a beautiful thought so
[1:06:47] I want you to know something at the
[1:06:49] beginning of these meetings I want you
[1:06:52] understand something clearly this is
[1:06:56] message is not a message of do's and
[1:06:58] don'ts did I offend you I said this
[1:07:08] message is not a message of do's and
[1:07:09] don'ts well what do we do with the do's
[1:07:13] and don'ts brother Danny we make it a
[1:07:16] message of do's and don'ts we make it a
[1:07:19] message of you have to do this and ya
[1:07:21] can't do that but what this message is
[1:07:26] it's a message of obedience can I say it
[1:07:34] again it's not a message of do's and
[1:07:36] don'ts it's a message of obedience
[1:07:38] what's the difference brother Danny
[1:07:39] the difference is it's not a obedience
[1:07:44] born out of fear of retribution and
[1:07:49] anger towards you amen
[1:07:53] not being obedient because
[1:07:56] if we fear that if we do wrong
[1:07:59] we're not be forgiving and will not be
[1:08:01] forsaken but your obedience to God must
[1:08:07] be born out of love and it must be born
[1:08:11] out of trust how many marriages went off
[1:08:16] the rails because it was a marriage of
[1:08:18] do's and don'ts a man and when we do
[1:08:26] that we begin to pull them away from the
[1:08:29] Christ that can change that Amen God is
[1:08:35] calling us to a life of obedience and a
[1:08:38] life of Trustee how many times did we
[1:08:40] hear brother Branham say payment
[1:08:42] drinking's not a cent
[1:08:44] smoking's not a sin adultery is not a
[1:08:48] sin then they said well pray tell me
[1:08:50] brother Branham what is a sin
[1:08:52] he said unbelief he said you do those
[1:08:56] things because you don't believe and if
[1:09:03] you say you believe and you're doing
[1:09:04] those things the message is just a
[1:09:06] message of do's and don'ts God wants to
[1:09:10] take it far beyond that to a life of
[1:09:12] trusting and we could never realize Amen
[1:09:16] that we love God and we could never love
[1:09:18] God unless we first realize that he
[1:09:20] loved us and I want you to I want to
[1:09:23] understand when we talk about feeling
[1:09:25] the presence of God that's in this room
[1:09:26] it's not an impersonal presence and it's
[1:09:29] numb but not somebody that standoffish I
[1:09:32] mean it's not a creator he said that
[1:09:34] created and folded his arms and stood
[1:09:37] back to watch what his creation would do
[1:09:39] somebody help me he's not send him back
[1:09:42] here tonight saying I wonder Amen what
[1:09:44] these young people are going to do
[1:09:45] tonight are they going to respond to
[1:09:48] Danny's voice or are they I hope they
[1:09:50] get enthused about it I mean look at
[1:09:52] them some of them are looking around
[1:09:53] now to see who else is looking around
[1:09:58] what's going on he's not standing back
[1:10:01] like this in fact brother branham said
[1:10:03] his very existence is for his old he
[1:10:09] exists Amen to live and to work he is
[1:10:15] right now the shepherd of his sheep is
[1:10:19] right now here to sustain you and to
[1:10:23] comfort you and to tell you you begin to
[1:10:26] believe what you're listening to because
[1:10:30] that thing you're going through is not
[1:10:32] more powerful than my word it may be a
[1:10:35] strong man that's got a hold of you but
[1:10:37] there's a stronger one and I say man
[1:10:44] glory we can all worship a Great Creator
[1:10:51] hey man but he wants you to know he's
[1:10:54] existing for you hey man Brande he
[1:11:02] existed for you he existed so he could
[1:11:06] deliver you from drugs
[1:11:08] that's his very reason of living he
[1:11:13] existed so you could write a testimony
[1:11:16] and ask everybody around the world if
[1:11:20] they wanted it isn't that true he exists
[1:11:25] so you can be here he's the god of our
[1:11:29] existence glory
[1:11:36] so his he is working faithfully among
[1:11:39] you right now as the great Shepherd of
[1:11:41] the sheep and his very existence is for
[1:11:43] you I want to say this everybody that's
[1:11:47] called of God everybody that's called of
[1:11:50] God has the ability to trust and obey
[1:11:55] it's not something hard for me to trust
[1:11:58] my wife Amen everybody has the ability
[1:12:03] in here tonight to trust and obey
[1:12:06] you read many scriptures that call for
[1:12:08] obedience you said brother Danny what is
[1:12:10] the difference between obedience and
[1:12:12] do's and dont's love God would tell
[1:12:16] Israel if you're obedient to the word
[1:12:18] they would eat to go to the land god
[1:12:21] never lets obedience go unrewarded so if
[1:12:30] he's calling you tonight let me tell you
[1:12:32] be obedient to that because you're not
[1:12:34] being obedient to me you're being
[1:12:36] obedient to the call so he never lets
[1:12:41] obedience go unrewarded but he is not
[1:12:44] rewarding you because he's proud of you
[1:12:49] he's not rewarding you because you've
[1:12:51] been a good person but you're rewarded
[1:12:55] because that's where obedience led you
[1:12:58] to obedience led you to the promise
[1:13:02] because he always gives a promise and he
[1:13:06] never reneged on the promise
[1:13:10] amen amen
[1:13:13] and the promise is the reward obedience
[1:13:17] leads to greater things the word that
[1:13:23] God has given us is designed amen to
[1:13:27] bring forth and more than what you see
[1:13:29] on the surface why because the Bible
[1:13:33] says the word is a seed seeds are much
[1:13:36] more than that little form that you have
[1:13:38] how many planted garden right there much
[1:13:44] more than the little form that comes
[1:13:46] from the fruit that it comes from the
[1:13:50] seed properly cultivated would bring
[1:13:54] forth reward after reward after reward
[1:13:59] it would bring forth what it had the
[1:14:02] potential to bring forth I could lay a
[1:14:06] seed up here of a vegetable I could lay
[1:14:08] a seat up here of a fruit I could lay up
[1:14:11] here in a corn of an oak tree and it
[1:14:13] would
[1:14:13] ever be enough to feed myself alone let
[1:14:20] alone everybody amen but properly
[1:14:23] cultivated that seed will bring forth
[1:14:26] food for much more than myself
[1:14:29] it'll keep producing seeds all along are
[1:14:33] you with me
[1:14:34] but if the seed lays in a place where it
[1:14:37] cannot be cultivated it will not work it
[1:14:40] will be powerless
[1:14:41] there will be no strength in it to
[1:14:43] sustain you that's why people walked
[1:14:45] away from the message the word they had
[1:14:48] was only in a seed fog did they have the
[1:14:50] word they had the word but it was only
[1:14:53] in his seed form and it wasn't
[1:14:55] cultivated by the Holy Ghost I could lay
[1:15:02] an acorn up right up here on this this
[1:15:04] pulpit right now and it would never
[1:15:05] provide shade for me I could quote it
[1:15:09] service after service and it would never
[1:15:11] be a benefit to me unless Amen I put it
[1:15:14] in a place where it could come forth
[1:15:18] Amen no matter how long I preach it it
[1:15:21] has to be planted and then there has to
[1:15:23] be patience for it to develop and to
[1:15:25] grow but once placed in its proper
[1:15:27] condition it will provide shade for
[1:15:32] generations and keep dropping acorns
[1:15:39] come on
[1:15:41] but where did it start amen everybody
[1:15:43] wants God aiming to come along and say
[1:15:45] Lord I want this I want a house I want a
[1:15:48] table I want to try want this God says I
[1:15:50] give you trees
[1:16:00] you could be under a tree all your life
[1:16:03] and ask God to give you things and be
[1:16:06] disappointed because you never got what
[1:16:08] you asked for
[1:16:10] now if you look around you see I look
[1:16:13] out the window I know you wanted to God
[1:16:17] still in the business of giving Therese
[1:16:23] well what who makes the table who builds
[1:16:31] the house who forms things with their
[1:16:35] hands are you with me a man I could ask
[1:16:42] God to give me a pulpit and God said I
[1:16:44] gave you a tree well God what good does
[1:16:48] that do me wake up pulpit God wants amen
[1:16:55] that investment of that seed to come
[1:16:59] back to him more than way he presented
[1:17:02] it to you
[1:17:05] Amen young people when he presented you
[1:17:08] the books and he presented you the tapes
[1:17:11] he didn't presented to you to say I got
[1:17:14] a tree those things are given to you
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:20] to form sons and daughters of God glory
[1:17:30] you know God never gave Israel the
[1:17:34] tabernacle and the wilderness to them he
[1:17:38] didn't he gave him the pattern he gave
[1:17:44] him the pattern but among the children
[1:17:46] of Israel were men that would cause this
[1:17:51] heavenly vision to become on earth
[1:18:00] the talent was already in the men to
[1:18:05] make that heavenly vision become
[1:18:07] something earthly that could bless
[1:18:12] generations and young people I don't
[1:18:19] know how to tell you I want to walk down
[1:18:22] there but I'm scared too Moses ain't the
[1:18:27] one that built the tabernacle
[1:18:29] I said Moses is not the one that built
[1:18:36] the tabernacle he was the one God gave
[1:18:42] the pattern to amen and then God came to
[1:18:47] Moses and said Moses there's two men in
[1:18:51] your congregation Bezalel and I don't
[1:18:56] even know if I said that right no holy
[1:18:58] AAB you know I'm glad I didn't live back
[1:19:00] there dad well you know what if I lived
[1:19:01] there and I had that name been happy
[1:19:02] with it but anyway amen amen but it's
[1:19:05] hard to pronounce them now amen and he
[1:19:08] said yeah I've got two men among you
[1:19:10] that I put a spirit of wisdom and of
[1:19:12] knowledge on in them there's a talent in
[1:19:14] there and you know what that talent was
[1:19:16] never discovered in Egypt because as
[1:19:21] long as they were slaves Amen that seed
[1:19:24] could never be cultivated but God said I
[1:19:27] got him get him out of Egypt and God is
[1:19:30] here tonight to get you out of Egypt
[1:19:32] he's here to get you out of that slave
[1:19:34] hood and the slave mentality that I
[1:19:36] can't break these chains I'll tell you
[1:19:38] you don't have to break the chains God
[1:19:41] is already broken them but he wants you
[1:19:43] to know he's got more people in here to
[1:19:45] make this message live amen we don't
[1:19:48] have to look on the internet for facts
[1:19:49] this is a vindication this is the
[1:19:53] promise of God come on somebody help me
[1:19:59] young people god amen your event you're
[1:20:02] here till you say well hey well how many
[1:20:07] you girls want a boyfriend I didn't know

[1:20:21] well you ain't natural if you don't why
[1:20:27] didn't you laugh at that well it's in
[1:20:30] you God placed it there God put
[1:20:35] something in you a desire that would
[1:20:37] lead you to something I mean but before
[1:20:40] he could ever lead you to that for the
[1:20:42] right person and the right life and
[1:20:44] everything he wants you to know beyond
[1:20:46] all that relationship could ever give
[1:20:48] you I got something for you
[1:20:50] that I have commanded the husband and
[1:20:53] wife
[1:20:53] amen to be benevolent to one another but
[1:20:56] I would never give them a commandment
[1:20:57] that I would not keep for myself
[1:21:01] somebody helped me as the husband is
[1:21:04] commanded to give benevolence to the
[1:21:06] wife our great husband said I'll come
[1:21:08] down and sustain you you need somebody
[1:21:10] to love you let him love you let God be
[1:21:18] your husband
[1:21:19] he said well Danny I'm not very
[1:21:21] attractive and I'm primary this Wow
[1:21:25] well look at me I got married you know
[1:21:34] things happen I didn't always used to
[1:21:37] look like this
[1:21:39] I was slim but I was still bowlegged you
[1:21:48] know what uglies not all it's supposed
[1:21:50] to you know it's not that bad
[1:21:54] your brother Danny but I'm ugly nobody
[1:21:56] lesson we don't worry God's got a lot of
[1:21:58] ugly person that'll love you quit
[1:22:04] fantasizing imagining yourself in a
[1:22:06] place that you can never move beyond
[1:22:08] amen you have one
[1:22:10] amen amen who is the beauty and the
[1:22:12] desire of all nations
[1:22:14] you got one is called the Rose of Sharon
[1:22:17] and the lily of the valley and the
[1:22:19] bright morning star his love is more
[1:22:21] than enough you want that kind of love
[1:22:26] you want to love that a sustained yin
[1:22:28] your schoolwork
[1:22:29] you want a love that'll cost you to walk
[1:22:32] away from temptation what manner of love
[1:22:37] is this that's the love that's in the
[1:22:41] room Oh hallelujah
[1:22:48] that's the one that's here and if I I
[1:22:52] don't know it's beyond my human ability
[1:22:54] to present that to you well it's
[1:22:57] somewhere on my stumbling around and and
[1:22:59] moving up and down and everything and my
[1:23:01] personality if Grodd can speak through
[1:23:03] that and just quick in that heart for
[1:23:05] just a moment I want you to seize upon
[1:23:08] that impulse a man you don't sure a god
[1:23:11] that's far off when I say Amen a god
[1:23:13] that's far if you serve a God that is
[1:23:15] willing to forgive and when he's willing
[1:23:17] to forgive he don't put you on probation
[1:23:19] he's so willing to forgive a God who is
[1:23:22] omniscient will say I'll never remember
[1:23:24] it anymore did you hear me
[1:23:28] he's the only one that has the ability
[1:23:30] to forget something that'll never come
[1:23:33] back to this line again
[1:23:38] now the devil would tell you you're not
[1:23:39] much you don't have much lot in life
[1:23:42] when neither did bezalel and oholiab i
[1:23:44] mean they were slaves they were down in
[1:23:46] Egypt they were mud daubers hey man and
[1:23:48] here's Pharaoh he looks out the window
[1:23:50] and he sees no potential in them look at
[1:23:52] these they are they even interested what
[1:23:54] are they doing here
[1:23:56] I mean why in the world did we have to
[1:23:59] come to a camp and suffer through all
[1:24:01] these meetings is this even gonna work
[1:24:05] they're mud daubers they're slaves
[1:24:09] there's no value in them amen but to do
[1:24:12] what I tell them to do that's truly the
[1:24:15] do's and don'ts now the Prophet said
[1:24:18] Moses looked out of the same window and
[1:24:22] he never saw slaves even that's what a
[1:24:26] prophet comes for he comes with a
[1:24:28] different vision to give you a different
[1:24:30] eyesight to give you a different outlook
[1:24:32] in your life they said I don't see a mud
[1:24:35] dauber I see children to have a promise
[1:24:38] hey man there's not one of you in here
[1:24:41] that God hasn't promised something to
[1:24:43] why don't you remind me brother Danny
[1:24:45] well let me remind you then I meant for
[1:24:47] this day man well I'm almost 15 bring it
[1:24:52] back Lord all right
[1:24:54] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:24:56] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:24:58] of sins and ye shall be filled with the
[1:25:00] Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you
[1:25:03] and unto your children and to those that
[1:25:06] are far for for for me it was far far
[1:25:18] off and he said that promises to them
[1:25:21] Danny go remind them I have made them a
[1:25:26] promise I'm well aware the devil has
[1:25:29] made you a lot of promises well you're a
[1:25:32] beautiful girl you got you can go into
[1:25:34] fashion and you go to this and you can
[1:25:36] go far in your life you can have an
[1:25:37] ambition you can do this and you can do

[1:29:51] that's not the talent God gave you
[1:29:53] that's your talent there's more talent
[1:29:56] than that there's a gift and a calling
[1:30:00] him in its place there without
[1:30:02] repentance that God wants to awaken in
[1:30:06] your life glory I want you to go knowing

[1:31:09] right at his furrow and he called him he
[1:31:17] called him the Prophet the word of the
[1:31:19] hour called him she went by by just
[1:31:23] taking the mantle and throwing it at him
[1:31:26] and Elijah immediately knew that God was
[1:31:29] calling him a man and Elijah rose up out
[1:31:35] of his seat and he said you know what
[1:31:40] I'm gonna make this a business I can't
[1:31:43] come back to if I'm gonna give myself to
[1:31:47] this Elijah's mantle I'm gonna give all
[1:31:48] my energy and I'm gonna give all my
[1:31:50] strength because I know a man it's a
[1:31:53] holy calling and a holy desire what he
[1:31:56] didn't know yet that he was supposed to
[1:31:58] be part of that vision
[1:31:59] that Elijah thought he was riding the
[1:32:01] trail on come on now amen but when a man
[1:32:07] with a prophets word and a believer

[1:32:17] into sync this evening if it needs to be
[1:32:20] started with the song of repentance I
[1:32:22] surrender all why don't you begin to say
[1:32:25] I surrender all why don't you just begin
[1:32:30] to do that Elijah because you are God's
[1:32:35] workmanship your life is meant to
[1:32:38] inspire faith in God you are somebody
[1:32:44] there not some beat down little somebody
[1:32:47] as a prophet said Satan's trying to hide
[1:32:49] it from you who you are trying to keep
[1:32:52] the way back somewhere from the glorious
[1:32:54] revelation of God says you're just some
[1:32:56] beat downtrodden sinner

[1:33:24] happening so fast that the human mind
[1:33:25] can't comprehend how fast these things
[1:33:27] are coming upon us and it causes a
[1:33:30] troubling in their spirit we don't know
[1:33:31] what it is there's a fear of the future
[1:33:35] upon the people and they don't even know
[1:33:37] I mean that's because judgments hanging
[1:33:39] and coming they don't have to be the
[1:33:42] position of the people of God come on

[1:42:15] open in the house of David you don't
