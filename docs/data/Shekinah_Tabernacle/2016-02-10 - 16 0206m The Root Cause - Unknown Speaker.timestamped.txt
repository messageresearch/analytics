[1:04:42] hallelujah thank you musicians
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:47] oh good morning
[1:04:50] trust everyone had a good sleep and
[1:04:53] or as in one piece
[1:04:55] i mean
[1:04:56] uh if you've got your bibles handy we'll
[1:04:58] just uh
[1:04:59] turn uh to turn straight to the
[1:05:01] scripture i'm sorry it's so hot but
[1:05:04] uh yeah here we are i trust uh everyone
[1:05:06] can be as comfortable as they can be
[1:05:09] i'd like to go to romans chapter 8 and
[1:05:11] just read a very familiar piece of
[1:05:13] scripture
[1:05:14] uh
[1:05:16] there and then i'd like to go to second
[1:05:18] corinthians
[1:05:19] chapter 3 verses 17 and 18 so if we're
[1:05:23] romans chapter eight we're going to read
[1:05:25] from verse 14 down to verse 23.
[1:05:32] i'm sure this is all very familiar but
[1:05:35] sometimes we need to go over things
[1:05:38] you know to cement them down because
[1:05:40] some you know
[1:05:41] no doubt there'll be someone in here
[1:05:42] that they've heard for the first time
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] and sometimes we can be sitting in
[1:05:47] church for years but then the lights go
[1:05:49] on and then we begin to hear
[1:05:51] so
[1:05:52] amen let's just read this here
[1:05:55] for as many are as led by the spirit of
[1:05:58] god they are the sons of god
[1:06:00] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:06:02] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:06:05] received the spirit of adoption
[1:06:07] where i we cry abba father now let's
[1:06:10] just read that again
[1:06:11] that verse but just put i
[1:06:14] okay let's all read it together verse 15
[1:06:17] for i have not received the spirit of
[1:06:20] bondage again to fear but i have
[1:06:23] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:06:26] i cry ever father in other words my
[1:06:28] father my father
[1:06:30] hallelujah amen we know who we are we
[1:06:32] know where we're going and we know in
[1:06:34] whom we have believed
[1:06:36] amen the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:06:38] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:06:40] of god and if children then heirs ears
[1:06:42] of god and joint heirs with christ if so
[1:06:45] be that we suffer
[1:06:47] that we suffer with him we may be also
[1:06:50] glorified together for i reckon that the
[1:06:53] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:06:55] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:06:58] which shall be revealed in us so if
[1:07:00] you're suffering it doesn't even come
[1:07:02] into the equation of the glory that
[1:07:03] shall be revealed in you
[1:07:06] amen 4
[1:07:08] 4 sorry um verse 19 for the earnest
[1:07:11] expectation of the creature in that word
[1:07:13] is creation waiteth for the
[1:07:15] manifestation of the sons of god or the
[1:07:17] revealing of the sons of god for the
[1:07:19] creature was made subject to vanity not
[1:07:22] willingly but by reason of him who has
[1:07:25] subjected the same in hope because the
[1:07:27] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:07:30] from the bondage of corruption and to
[1:07:32] the glorious liberty of the children of
[1:07:34] god
[1:07:35] for we know that the whole creation
[1:07:36] groaneth and travaileth and pain
[1:07:38] together until now and not only they but
[1:07:41] ourselves also which have the first
[1:07:44] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:07:47] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:07:49] adoption to it the redemption of the
[1:07:52] body
[1:07:54] hallelujah and let's go to second
[1:07:55] corinthians
[1:07:57] uh chapter three
[1:08:04] and we'll read verses uh 17 to 18.
[1:08:11] he says this here
[1:08:13] he says now the lord is that spirit
[1:08:16] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:08:17] there is liberty
[1:08:19] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:08:23] in a glass the glory of the lord are
[1:08:25] changed
[1:08:26] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:08:29] even as by the spirit of the lord amen
[1:08:32] you may have your seats may the lord
[1:08:33] bless his word
[1:08:35] so i'd like to
[1:08:36] can you turn me down brother adamander
[1:08:38] but
[1:08:39] um
[1:08:40] i'd like to speak this morning if i if i
[1:08:42] try and approach the subject about the
[1:08:43] power of the blood in action
[1:08:45] because you know we understand even even
[1:08:47] in
[1:08:48] in the time of exodus and the first
[1:08:50] passover you know they had to apply the
[1:08:51] blood it was a it was an action that
[1:08:53] they had to do
[1:08:54] and so
[1:08:55] we i'll just read a i'll just read a you
[1:08:58] know a statement that brother bradham
[1:09:00] gives
[1:09:01] and he says this in experiences in 52
[1:09:04] he says but now as i'm speaking to you
[1:09:06] like jesus did to the woman at the well
[1:09:08] now if there's something wrong with that
[1:09:09] woman and jesus talked to her a little
[1:09:12] bit he went right straight and told her
[1:09:14] what was wrong with her is that right
[1:09:16] not knowing her he was a jew and she was
[1:09:19] a samaritan
[1:09:20] he just stood up there at the well and
[1:09:22] she came by so after talking to her a
[1:09:25] little bit
[1:09:26] then he could tell her what was wrong
[1:09:28] now if i be a christian man if the
[1:09:30] spirit of god is in me and that is the
[1:09:32] spirit of christ then it'll make me
[1:09:34] conduct like him make me a christian
[1:09:36] like him on top of that if he gives us a
[1:09:39] spiritual gift the presence of god and
[1:09:42] all his presence near then he will be
[1:09:45] just like he was then he could go
[1:09:48] he could go straight see he has no lips
[1:09:51] on earth but mine ours he says no hands
[1:09:55] but ours our eyes he speaks through us
[1:09:58] and looks through us and sees through us
[1:10:00] he says is that right so if we want if
[1:10:03] god is going to do something he uses his
[1:10:05] body
[1:10:06] amen so if there is you know
[1:10:08] so for the in order for the for the very
[1:10:11] you know he you know as we read in
[1:10:12] romans chapter 8 he said that the very
[1:10:14] manifestation or the revealing of the
[1:10:16] sons of god will actually cause the
[1:10:19] earth to be you know to experience its
[1:10:21] own jubilee
[1:10:22] amen it actually takes us to for for not
[1:10:25] the natural man to be revealed but the
[1:10:27] spiritual man in us to be made manifest
[1:10:30] and when the bride comes to her position
[1:10:33] amen then then the rapture will go and
[1:10:35] then god sets in motion now he's going
[1:10:37] to cleanse off the earth and everything
[1:10:40] so it's when the bride comes to her
[1:10:41] position then the earth is redeemed
[1:10:43] because we understand that we are in a
[1:10:45] jubilee season
[1:10:47] and in that jubilee season not only are
[1:10:49] the children of god being set free
[1:10:51] they've been liberated we have been
[1:10:52] liberated from light to darkness i mean
[1:10:55] sorry from darkness to light rather
[1:10:56] we've been liberated from sin the world
[1:10:58] false message culture religion we've
[1:11:01] been delivered from these things
[1:11:03] but it's not only the people that will
[1:11:05] be delivered or experience a jubilee but
[1:11:07] it is the world that will experience the
[1:11:09] jubilee
[1:11:10] and because we have been set free then
[1:11:12] the world is not far away from its own
[1:11:15] being set free
[1:11:16] hallelujah
[1:11:18] so now i want to let's just go to luke
[1:11:20] chapter four i just want to try and
[1:11:22] uh lay a bit of a foundation if i may
[1:11:24] but
[1:11:25] we see that you know
[1:11:27] the word always comes to the prophet it
[1:11:29] says in amos 3 7. we understand that the
[1:11:31] lord will do nothing until he reveals it
[1:11:33] to his servants the prophets and so it
[1:11:35] takes a prophet to place us in the word
[1:11:37] where we are
[1:11:39] i mean because people have been
[1:11:40] wondering for you know down through the
[1:11:42] church age they came out of darkness
[1:11:43] they made bible schools and they were
[1:11:45] you know looking to see when certain
[1:11:47] scriptures will be fulfilled but it's
[1:11:49] not man's mind that can put together
[1:11:51] where we are in the word or where we are
[1:11:53] in history but it takes a prophet to
[1:11:55] stand upon the earth and he points to
[1:11:57] certain scriptures and say this is where
[1:11:58] you are
[1:11:59] amen this is where you are on your
[1:12:01] you're on the timeline or on the roadmap
[1:12:03] this is where you are and jesus in luke
[1:12:05] chapter 4 and we'll just read this from
[1:12:07] verse 16. you know jesus he you know
[1:12:09] stands up and he begins to proclaim
[1:12:11] something that no doubt many rabbi had
[1:12:13] read the same scripture and many you
[1:12:15] know no doubt people had sat down and
[1:12:17] spoke about it but there came a season
[1:12:19] when this would be fulfilled
[1:12:21] and he says and he came to nazareth
[1:12:23] where he had been brought up and as his
[1:12:25] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[1:12:28] the sabbath day and stood up for to read
[1:12:30] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:12:31] book of the prophet isaiah and when he
[1:12:34] had opened the book he found the place
[1:12:36] where it was written and he began so so
[1:12:38] he finds this place deliberately he says
[1:12:40] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:12:42] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:12:44] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:12:46] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:12:48] deliverance to the captives and
[1:12:50] recovering of the sight to the blind and
[1:12:52] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:12:54] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:12:56] lord and he closed the book and he gave
[1:12:58] it
[1:12:59] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:13:01] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:13:03] synagogue were were fastened on him and
[1:13:06] he began to say unto them this day this
[1:13:08] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[1:13:11] you understand if you go and read from
[1:13:12] isaiah when he was reading from he cut
[1:13:14] the last scripture in half because that
[1:13:16] was pertaining to a second coming so
[1:13:18] jesus was standing there and he was
[1:13:20] proclaiming now is the season i mean
[1:13:22] where people are going to be set free
[1:13:24] amen they're going to be you know healed
[1:13:26] the brokenhearted are going to be mended
[1:13:28] you know there's going to be deliverance
[1:13:30] preached to the captives the recovering
[1:13:31] of the sight to the blind to sit at
[1:13:33] liberty you know them that are bruce so
[1:13:35] he was declaring this is what's going to
[1:13:37] happen and then he began to demonstrate
[1:13:39] that scripture in his life hallelujah
[1:13:41] where the devils were cast out lepers
[1:13:43] were healed amen you know you're the man
[1:13:45] legion 1 000 demons in him he couldn't
[1:13:48] control his own life he was there in the
[1:13:50] you know you know they're in the tombs
[1:13:52] and you know no doubt he didn't start
[1:13:53] out that way
[1:13:55] i mean but he just made a wrong step
[1:13:57] maybe just got amongst the wrong you
[1:13:59] know you know group of people
[1:14:01] and then and then something came in and
[1:14:02] got a hold of his life and you i know
[1:14:05] for myself
[1:14:07] this flesh ruled me one time
[1:14:10] amen and the people hey
[1:14:12] my friends were good people you know we
[1:14:14] had a you know i thought they were good
[1:14:15] and you know they were morally they were
[1:14:17] fine they never ended up in prison or
[1:14:19] killed anyone or didn't anything like
[1:14:20] that but being under that atmosphere
[1:14:23] where i was
[1:14:25] you know i was dragged into places i
[1:14:27] didn't really want to be
[1:14:29] i mean and even i could not set myself
[1:14:31] free from the desires that were in here
[1:14:34] hallelujah but then one day i had a word
[1:14:36] i mean i heard the voice behind the
[1:14:38] voice amen the prophet speaking was more
[1:14:40] than a man i remember god spoke to me
[1:14:43] because it's not logical you think about
[1:14:45] it there's nothing you know even your
[1:14:47] church it doesn't matter how big your
[1:14:48] church is how well polished it is and
[1:14:51] how well everything's set up
[1:14:52] compared to the worldly churches we
[1:14:54] don't have anything that looks
[1:14:56] you know physically good
[1:14:58] you know there's nothing you know you
[1:14:59] don't walk in at some great big program
[1:15:01] and everything's so polished and you
[1:15:03] know there's nothing naturally that
[1:15:05] would desire
[1:15:07] what we have there's nothing natural i
[1:15:09] mean so it actually defies logic
[1:15:12] you sitting here defies logic
[1:15:14] hallelujah because really if you had
[1:15:16] your own way you know you just go to a
[1:15:18] modern church and have your cake and eat
[1:15:20] it too because there's no deliverance
[1:15:22] there's no actually surrendering
[1:15:23] yourself it's just your lip service
[1:15:25] i remember something was in you that
[1:15:27] drew you i trust
[1:15:28] hallelujah that you could see even a
[1:15:30] bunch of people in maybe a building a
[1:15:32] lot smaller and worse than this but you
[1:15:34] saw this god there
[1:15:35] there's god in these people in it and it
[1:15:37] attracted you
[1:15:39] hallelujah it defies logic because you
[1:15:41] know like new zealand there's no
[1:15:43] pressure to be a christian in new
[1:15:44] zealand there's no family pressure
[1:15:46] there's no village pressure there's no
[1:15:48] you know you can disappear out of
[1:15:50] christianity you can do whatever you
[1:15:51] want
[1:15:52] there's no pressure so it defies logic
[1:15:55] to look at something that appears to be
[1:15:58] a cult i'll use the word
[1:16:01] i mean that appears to be bondage oh you
[1:16:03] can't do this can't do that you can't
[1:16:05] you can't smoke and drink and party and
[1:16:07] do all these things can't run around
[1:16:09] with women i don't want that kind of
[1:16:11] religion that's what the natural man
[1:16:12] says but the spiritual man says that's
[1:16:14] what i'm looking for because people who
[1:16:16] are trapped in a cycle like the woman at
[1:16:18] the well they did not foresee their life
[1:16:21] would go that way the prodigal son would
[1:16:24] never have fathomed when he said to his
[1:16:25] dad i want my inheritance he would never
[1:16:28] have it would not even come near his
[1:16:30] thinking that he'd end up in a foreign
[1:16:32] land
[1:16:33] feeding unclean animals
[1:16:36] and he was in such a desperate situation
[1:16:38] that he said if i could only eat their
[1:16:40] scraps
[1:16:42] amen he would never have
[1:16:44] but
[1:16:45] life dragged him down that way
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:49] but then
[1:16:50] but then he had
[1:16:52] he had a father that was praying
[1:16:54] and i want i really want to go into
[1:16:56] these things because god uses the body
[1:16:58] you say lord save my children save my
[1:17:00] family god's going to use you
[1:17:02] amen god's going to use you he's not
[1:17:04] just going to necessarily be a bolt from
[1:17:06] the blue
[1:17:07] he only has
[1:17:09] our hands
[1:17:10] he only has our lips remember this is
[1:17:13] not just on the prophet of the five-fold
[1:17:15] ministry this is on every member of the
[1:17:17] body
[1:17:18] i mean because the same anointing that
[1:17:19] was on jesus christ amen that was on the
[1:17:22] apostles that was on brother branham
[1:17:24] that same life has come into the church
[1:17:26] amen that same life is in the bride to
[1:17:28] do the same things that he did and i'm
[1:17:31] not necessarily saying saying you know
[1:17:33] discerning the thoughts and tense of the
[1:17:34] hearts you know but there'd be a life
[1:17:36] lived
[1:17:37] amen and and everyone has their own
[1:17:39] position in the body no part of the body
[1:17:42] is greater than the other
[1:17:43] i've never seen my spleen but i think i
[1:17:45] need it
[1:17:46] i mean i've never seen some little part
[1:17:49] of me that you know but i really need
[1:17:51] that part
[1:17:52] amen christ needs every one of us
[1:17:55] amen because even even like a great big
[1:17:57] orchestra you could may think you know
[1:18:00] i'm not people don't even notice me
[1:18:03] but if you take a big orchestra you know
[1:18:06] there's the lead violinist and all these
[1:18:08] things but there's a guy in the back
[1:18:10] that you barely notice but the guy who's
[1:18:12] conducting he knows he's there
[1:18:14] and and and and the people practice for
[1:18:16] hours and things and here's this man and
[1:18:18] he just kind of
[1:18:19] gets up and he puts a suit on he drives
[1:18:21] to where they're playing and he gets his
[1:18:23] little triangle out
[1:18:25] but he's got a part that's the important
[1:18:27] thing he's got a part in the sim
[1:18:29] amen and his part is just as important
[1:18:30] as the lead violinist or the pianist
[1:18:32] whoever is because if he doesn't sound
[1:18:34] his ting
[1:18:35] i mean if he does it because sometimes
[1:18:37] you see them you know they just one time
[1:18:39] and they stand there for the rest of the
[1:18:41] maybe maybe the big symbols
[1:18:44] and that's and that's all they do and
[1:18:46] you don't really because you really
[1:18:47] focus on the violence they're playing
[1:18:49] and you're all these things you focus on
[1:18:50] the people up front but the people in
[1:18:52] the back are just as important
[1:18:54] i mean they're just as important so
[1:18:56] friends don't be weary and well-doing
[1:18:58] amen you may never be noticed or
[1:19:01] recognized publicly on the in this life
[1:19:04] but one day you'll receive a reward
[1:19:06] hallelujah brother ram said the names
[1:19:08] were called up they went up before the
[1:19:09] king of kings
[1:19:11] hallelujah and you know so don't be
[1:19:13] weary and well doing
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] this as we read in ii corinthians
[1:19:19] this open face
[1:19:21] he says here
[1:19:22] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:19:25] in a glass the glory of the lord are
[1:19:26] changed into the same image from glory
[1:19:28] to glory even by the spirit of the lord
[1:19:30] this word open in the greek is actually
[1:19:32] means unveiled
[1:19:34] amen it means to unveil so now this
[1:19:37] scripture for me is this hour
[1:19:39] where god has fully unveiled himself
[1:19:41] revealed himself we're not wondering
[1:19:43] what god likes and god doesn't like
[1:19:46] in every part of life we're not
[1:19:48] stumbling well does he like this does he
[1:19:49] know like this is this pleasing is this
[1:19:51] not pleasing we know what he likes
[1:19:53] i mean he knows what he enjoys he yo we
[1:19:56] know what he doesn't like
[1:19:57] and brother branham you know to me you
[1:19:59] know the prophet would stand up and and
[1:20:01] he'd give a sermon title it's not just a
[1:20:03] sermon title he's making declaration and
[1:20:06] he would stand there in front of
[1:20:07] thousands of people or hundreds and he'd
[1:20:09] preach the sermon the mighty god
[1:20:11] unveiled before us
[1:20:13] hallelujah and he's declaring jesus is
[1:20:15] here he's unveiled himself in this
[1:20:18] generation
[1:20:19] and then when you behold him
[1:20:21] amen you are changed from glory to glory
[1:20:23] into his image
[1:20:25] hallelujah that's why we must listen to
[1:20:27] the voice
[1:20:28] amen there's transforming power in that
[1:20:30] voice
[1:20:32] amen so
[1:20:33] you know the prophet himself would stand
[1:20:35] up and he would
[1:20:36] you know there was a time when he was in
[1:20:38] a uh you know a meeting with the full
[1:20:39] gospel businessman and i know this is
[1:20:41] familiar to you know most of us and and
[1:20:44] his wife gave him a new bible and he's
[1:20:46] trying to find the text and the two
[1:20:48] pages are stuck together and then a
[1:20:50] catholic priest gets up from from you
[1:20:52] know behind him and he and then he
[1:20:54] stands up and he and he says read out of
[1:20:56] my scriptures you know god's fixing to
[1:20:58] move he basically says and then after
[1:21:01] this you know he's driving in the car
[1:21:02] wherever he was
[1:21:04] and then the lord points him back to in
[1:21:06] the synagogue and that same scene is
[1:21:08] being played out again
[1:21:10] and so and then he would preach a sermon
[1:21:12] this day this scripture is fulfilled and
[1:21:15] he would go to malachi 4 and he would
[1:21:17] identify himself in the scripture and
[1:21:18] he'd say you know luke 17 30 the son of
[1:21:21] man has been revealed and he said this
[1:21:23] day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:21:25] hallelujah and he would declare this is
[1:21:26] where we are and not only that but at
[1:21:29] the end of his ministry if you'd like to
[1:21:30] turn with me to first thessalonians
[1:21:32] because as i i said that
[1:21:35] a prophet it takes a prophet to place
[1:21:37] you in the scripture
[1:21:40] it's so important you know when when a
[1:21:43] prophet would stand up
[1:21:45] and say here you are
[1:21:46] it throws the believer into a certain
[1:21:48] expectation
[1:21:49] because not only where you're about to
[1:21:51] go to
[1:21:52] but what he's doing to you to get you to
[1:21:54] that place and we read here in first
[1:21:57] thessalonians and
[1:21:59] we have this here in 1st thessalonians
[1:22:01] chapter 4
[1:22:02] or we'll just read verses 16.
[1:22:06] now let's read sorry from verse 15
[1:22:10] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:22:13] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:22:15] remain into the coming of the lord shall
[1:22:17] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:22:19] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:22:21] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:22:23] the archangel and the trump of god and
[1:22:25] the dead in christ shall rise first then
[1:22:27] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:22:29] caught up together with them in the
[1:22:31] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:22:34] so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:22:36] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:22:39] words but if we keep reading remember
[1:22:40] the next chapter is not a different
[1:22:42] thought he says but of the times and
[1:22:44] seasons brethren we have no need that i
[1:22:46] write unto you for you yourselves know
[1:22:48] perfectly that the day of the lord so
[1:22:50] cometh as
[1:22:51] a thief in the night so when they shall
[1:22:53] say peace and safety and what are they
[1:22:55] saying around the world peace and safety
[1:22:57] we're going to fix it all
[1:22:58] amen then sudden destruction cometh unto
[1:23:01] them as travail upon a woman with child
[1:23:04] and they shall not escape
[1:23:06] amen but ye
[1:23:08] but ye brethren are not in darkness that
[1:23:10] that day should overtake you as a thief
[1:23:12] here all children of light and the
[1:23:14] children of the day and we are not of
[1:23:17] the night nor of darkness therefore let
[1:23:19] us not sleep as others do but let us be
[1:23:21] let us watch and be sober for they that
[1:23:24] sleep sleep in the night and they that
[1:23:26] be drunk and are drunken in the night
[1:23:28] and he says let us but let us who are of
[1:23:31] the day be sober putting on the
[1:23:32] breastplate of faith and love and of the
[1:23:34] helmet the hope of salvation for god has
[1:23:37] not appointed you should say me us to
[1:23:40] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[1:23:42] lord jesus christ and then so he he
[1:23:46] you know you know brother brown preaches
[1:23:47] a sermon the rapture at the end of his
[1:23:49] ministry
[1:23:50] and
[1:23:51] he
[1:23:52] he begins to speak about first
[1:23:54] thessalonians chapter four and he's
[1:23:55] about to place this in this and i'm just
[1:23:57] going to read this this is from this is
[1:23:58] from the rapture message he says three
[1:24:00] things happen he says a voice a shout a
[1:24:04] trumpet
[1:24:05] has to happen before jesus appears now
[1:24:07] shout
[1:24:08] jesus does all three of them when he's
[1:24:10] descending a shout what is a shout it's
[1:24:12] the message going forth first the living
[1:24:15] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[1:24:17] now god has a way
[1:24:19] of doing things and he never changes his
[1:24:22] policy he never changes he's the
[1:24:24] unchanging god at amos 3 7 he would do
[1:24:28] nothing on the earth until first he
[1:24:29] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[1:24:32] and just as certain as he promised it
[1:24:33] he'll do it
[1:24:35] now we've come through the church ages
[1:24:37] but we've promised in the last days of
[1:24:39] according to malachi 4 that there would
[1:24:42] be a return again a prophet in the land
[1:24:44] he says now notice his nature
[1:24:46] god um he says god uses that spirit five
[1:24:49] times
[1:24:51] speaking of the spirit of elijah once
[1:24:52] and elijah and elisha and john the
[1:24:54] baptist to call out the church and the
[1:24:55] remnant of the jews five times grace he
[1:24:58] says now
[1:25:00] he says if any message goes forth if
[1:25:02] it's a true message if it's a true
[1:25:04] genuine miracles of god and hangs right
[1:25:07] in that organization you know it's not
[1:25:09] of god because that thing's already
[1:25:11] declared jesus went forth and healed the
[1:25:14] sick in order to catch the eyes of the
[1:25:16] people in his message that's right it
[1:25:18] has to have something that god's going
[1:25:21] to introduce
[1:25:22] divine he's just divine healing as
[1:25:25] miracles like that just catch the eyes
[1:25:27] of the people the the main heart of its
[1:25:29] message that's what uh
[1:25:32] there's what it's what comes from in
[1:25:35] here he's trying to get favor of the
[1:25:37] people so they'll sit and listen to them
[1:25:40] see
[1:25:41] for there's some in there that's
[1:25:42] ordained to life and some of the grain
[1:25:45] wheat fell on the ground and the birds
[1:25:46] picked it up the others fell among
[1:25:48] thorns and some went on prepared ground
[1:25:50] prepared ground and brought forth
[1:25:53] the first thing is the sounding or the
[1:25:55] first thing is the trumpet a voice a
[1:25:57] shout
[1:25:58] and then a voice and then a trumpet
[1:26:01] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:26:02] reading the second is a voice of the
[1:26:06] resurrection the same voice that a loud
[1:26:08] voice in saint john 11 38 and 44 and
[1:26:11] we're going to read that soon that
[1:26:12] called lazarus from the grave getting
[1:26:14] the bride together and then the
[1:26:15] resurrection of the dead sea to be
[1:26:17] caught up with it now watch these three
[1:26:20] things take place
[1:26:22] the next is what was a trumpet a voice
[1:26:25] sorry a voice a shadow voice and a
[1:26:27] trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet
[1:26:29] which always at the feast of trumpets is
[1:26:31] the calling of the people to the feast
[1:26:33] and that'll be the bride supper the lamb
[1:26:36] supper with the bride in the sky see the
[1:26:38] first thing comes forth is his message
[1:26:40] calling the bride together
[1:26:42] the next thing is a resurrection of the
[1:26:44] sleeping bride the ones who died back in
[1:26:46] other ages they're caught together and
[1:26:48] the trumpet the feast and the heavens
[1:26:50] and the sky why that's the thing that
[1:26:52] takes place friends
[1:26:54] we're right there ready now the only
[1:26:57] thing the church coming out has to lay
[1:27:00] before the sun to ripen the great
[1:27:02] combine will come by after a while the
[1:27:05] wheat will be burned the stalks but the
[1:27:07] grain will be gathered into the into its
[1:27:10] ghana see
[1:27:11] you're not blind people you're sensible
[1:27:13] people
[1:27:14] and he says and if i stood here and said
[1:27:16] these things were prejudiced i'd say
[1:27:18] i say it because it's life because i'm
[1:27:21] responsible to god for saying it and i
[1:27:23] must say it
[1:27:24] so he's saying now this is he's saying
[1:27:26] this is where you are
[1:27:27] because the message is the shout i mean
[1:27:30] he doesn't leave that up for you know
[1:27:31] just to question or maybe ponder it he
[1:27:33] just declares the message is the shout i
[1:27:36] mean the next thing is the resurrection
[1:27:38] of the dead saints
[1:27:40] but he says now he says that the church
[1:27:42] now has to ripen in the presence of the
[1:27:44] son
[1:27:45] now if you know i know there's some
[1:27:47] farmers here you know and
[1:27:49] what what dictates the time you harvest
[1:27:52] it's not just the weather it's the
[1:27:54] condition of the plant
[1:27:56] amen so it's not the it's not the farmer
[1:28:00] that dictates now is the harvest time
[1:28:02] it's actually what you see in the grain
[1:28:05] i mean so it's actually now the life
[1:28:07] when the life comes up into the grain it
[1:28:08] becomes golden it's actually the life in
[1:28:11] the grain calling to the farmer harvest
[1:28:13] me i'm ready
[1:28:15] hallelujah so it comes a time where the
[1:28:18] life in you
[1:28:19] amen when it comes to mature and
[1:28:21] remember now we are the sons of god
[1:28:24] i mean not not one day now we are we're
[1:28:26] not looking for another day another year
[1:28:28] maybe 20 years now we are the sons of
[1:28:31] god amen do not let the devil rob you
[1:28:33] and say maybe tomorrow maybe next camp
[1:28:36] or maybe next year or maybe when you get
[1:28:38] a bit older right now
[1:28:40] holy right now you are the sons of god
[1:28:43] and so he says now that the the the
[1:28:45] wheat just has to land the prince of the
[1:28:47] sun and ripen
[1:28:48] so there will come a time when the life
[1:28:51] in us not the natural life the
[1:28:52] supernatural life of god i mean comes to
[1:28:54] us maturity and then the life in us will
[1:28:56] call to him
[1:28:58] harvest me
[1:28:59] i'm ready to be to be taken
[1:29:02] hallelujah it's actually us that brings
[1:29:03] on the resurrection amen that that life
[1:29:06] that that was that was released out of
[1:29:07] the prophet because jesus said the words
[1:29:09] i speak to you are spirit and life i
[1:29:12] mean so when so when brother brown was
[1:29:13] preaching he was preaching the life of
[1:29:15] god was coming forth in that word
[1:29:17] and then when it's received in her heart
[1:29:19] of faith it produces what the word is
[1:29:21] preached
[1:29:22] it means it will produce the very life
[1:29:24] of god and a believer
[1:29:26] hallelujah so we are waiting
[1:29:29] we just have to land the presence of the
[1:29:31] sun
[1:29:32] and i'll tell you we're not green
[1:29:35] amen the bride is not green anymore
[1:29:39] amen we have come to our position
[1:29:41] brother brown makes a statement i'm sure
[1:29:43] you've probably heard these things many
[1:29:44] times said oh he said if if the church
[1:29:47] only knew her position
[1:29:49] one day she will and then the rapture
[1:29:51] will go
[1:29:53] amen and we're living in that time
[1:29:56] we're not stumbling you know
[1:29:58] if god if god has called you and you've
[1:30:01] surrendered your life
[1:30:03] you're a joint here with him amen you
[1:30:06] just got to recognize
[1:30:08] you're not you know in the old testament
[1:30:10] under the law
[1:30:11] the woman in israel were second-class
[1:30:13] citizens
[1:30:14] but then under the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:17] peter says husbands that you'd be joint
[1:30:19] heirs
[1:30:20] with your wives as a lifting
[1:30:22] i mean of the woman up to be joined here
[1:30:24] with the man in christ
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:28] god used that illustration to show you
[1:30:30] your joint ears with him
[1:30:32] amen you're not a servant woman that's
[1:30:34] beaten as we heard last night we're
[1:30:36] esther
[1:30:37] we're not a concubine
[1:30:39] amen we are we are joiners she was
[1:30:41] joining with the king
[1:30:43] everything he had she had
[1:30:45] all she had to do was speak to the king
[1:30:47] and then all of his power of authority
[1:30:49] was released all she had to do was speak
[1:30:51] to him you say well i'm just a little in
[1:30:54] you know insignificant nobody absolutely
[1:30:56] god always uses people like that he
[1:30:59] doesn't use a celebrity he doesn't use
[1:31:01] the famous people he uses the nobodies
[1:31:04] amen you are built
[1:31:06] to receive this word
[1:31:08] amen you were built to become the bride
[1:31:10] of christ and i say you already were the
[1:31:12] bride of christ you just had to
[1:31:14] recognize it
[1:31:15] amen you just have to recognize who you
[1:31:17] were
[1:31:18] so now if we are the grain and he says
[1:31:20] in other sermons he says the grain is
[1:31:22] here
[1:31:23] amen so he's not waiting for another
[1:31:24] stage of the church he's saying the
[1:31:26] grain is here
[1:31:28] and so
[1:31:29] if his member the prophet places you in
[1:31:31] the word where you are what you are
[1:31:34] and we have now
[1:31:37] we have a
[1:31:38] you know as god has been and i yeah i
[1:31:40] trust you stay with me i'm sorry if this
[1:31:42] is all a bit all over the place but
[1:31:44] you know
[1:31:45] god has
[1:31:46] he he speaks you know the prophet speaks
[1:31:49] of a spirit
[1:31:50] and evolution of the spirit
[1:31:53] and he and he's not speaking as the mod
[1:31:54] in terms of like a frog eventually turns
[1:31:56] into a man amen but but he he's talking
[1:32:00] about it as it gets greater and greater
[1:32:03] all the time
[1:32:05] and then so he begins to and then we
[1:32:07] begin to see how the bride has evolved
[1:32:10] because remember all the ones from
[1:32:11] luther all the way down they're the
[1:32:12] bride as well
[1:32:14] they'll come up as well they're part of
[1:32:16] the they're part of the same body we're
[1:32:18] part of
[1:32:19] i mean we're just living out a different
[1:32:20] part of the word and so the bride has
[1:32:22] evolved as god has been restoring his
[1:32:25] word you take luther he was you know he
[1:32:28] was the messenger to that church age and
[1:32:30] he preached that josh shall live by
[1:32:31] faith and people
[1:32:33] receive liberty out of that catholic
[1:32:35] system but he was a bad drinker and he
[1:32:37] smoked the pipe
[1:32:39] amen if if he came into one of our
[1:32:41] meetings we'd say he's got a bit to grow
[1:32:44] god sanctify that man
[1:32:46] but he was the church age messenger for
[1:32:47] that age
[1:32:48] and and he also hated the jews and all
[1:32:50] these different things
[1:32:52] amen but then when wesley came it was a
[1:32:55] it wasn't taking away from what luther
[1:32:57] brought it was adding to and god was was
[1:33:00] evolving the bride further because he
[1:33:02] preached sanctification so he preached
[1:33:04] justification the just shall live by
[1:33:06] faith and then he preached about being
[1:33:08] sanctified living a sanctified life so
[1:33:10] it was coming closer to what it was
[1:33:12] meant to be but that's not the end
[1:33:13] product
[1:33:14] and then we had the pentecostals with
[1:33:16] the restoration of the gifts
[1:33:18] amen god restored the gifts back into
[1:33:20] the church
[1:33:21] and
[1:33:22] but that wasn't the end that wasn't god
[1:33:24] was still evolving up
[1:33:26] because we you know we understand god
[1:33:28] doesn't take away from what he's done he
[1:33:30] just adds to
[1:33:31] god is a god of addition not subtraction
[1:33:34] so all the things they had back in that
[1:33:36] those times we have in its perfection
[1:33:38] because luther i mean sorry wesley
[1:33:40] preach a method of sanctification that's
[1:33:42] why they're called methodists this is
[1:33:43] how you sanctify yourself but now when
[1:33:45] the life of god comes into you that
[1:33:47] cleanses you out
[1:33:48] so it's not a reformation god just does
[1:33:50] it for you brother braham says the bride
[1:33:53] is like a dove
[1:33:54] a dove doesn't need to take a bath
[1:33:56] there's an oil in it that cleanses
[1:33:58] itself out
[1:33:59] it just automatically does it you know
[1:34:01] the dove doesn't have to say oh i'm
[1:34:03] dirty i need oil work
[1:34:05] it just works
[1:34:07] amen it's there's a life in it that
[1:34:08] cleanses itself out and it's the same
[1:34:10] thing with you and my friends if the
[1:34:12] life of god is entered into you i mean
[1:34:14] there's always a cleansing the devil's
[1:34:16] always going to try and pour things into
[1:34:18] your life but there's an oil i mean
[1:34:20] there's a force that is stronger
[1:34:22] harlow that's already in you amen that
[1:34:24] can keep you cleansed
[1:34:26] so the bride the bride now
[1:34:30] you see in brother brown's life you just
[1:34:32] take the messengers
[1:34:33] brother branham he was
[1:34:36] he was the first one to come to maturity
[1:34:38] in this harvest season
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:41] and so now he
[1:34:43] he was demonstrating his life
[1:34:45] was demonstrating how the rest of us
[1:34:47] will come forth
[1:34:49] and so he so you could say from luther
[1:34:51] to wesley to brother branham there was
[1:34:54] an evolution of the spirit
[1:34:56] where a man would be so surrendered to
[1:34:58] god
[1:34:59] a prisoner against his own will
[1:35:01] and but confess his faults
[1:35:03] confess where he did wrong be a real man
[1:35:07] amen but god could so live in his life
[1:35:10] you know just as brother tim was saying
[1:35:12] he just come out of the platform you
[1:35:14] know and people just the spirit of god
[1:35:15] would just move out
[1:35:17] you know if you haven't heard sydney
[1:35:19] jackson's testimony when when brother
[1:35:21] biscuit was interviewing him about when
[1:35:22] brother brown went to south africa you
[1:35:24] should watch it again
[1:35:25] because you hear the prophet tell about
[1:35:27] it then you hear sydney jackson it's
[1:35:28] like they're talking about two different
[1:35:30] things
[1:35:31] because brother brown in his humility he
[1:35:33] didn't want to because he was there was
[1:35:35] god used him but he didn't want to lift
[1:35:37] himself up so he almost talked it down
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] so you see how he conducted himself so
[1:35:44] that was the bright and the mature form
[1:35:47] in every part of his life
[1:35:49] amen
[1:35:50] and so if that is the first part of the
[1:35:52] field to come to maturity
[1:35:54] and we understand in the book of
[1:35:55] leviticus there's the wave sheath
[1:35:57] offering
[1:35:58] and he and and brother abraham preaches
[1:36:00] the rising of the sun
[1:36:01] and he says that sheath is being waved
[1:36:03] again at the end time
[1:36:05] and what was it producing it was
[1:36:06] producing christ in him
[1:36:08] i mean to the revelation he received
[1:36:10] produced the very character of god
[1:36:12] and you can take the same with moses
[1:36:14] moses received the word in a revelation
[1:36:17] and that's why he could throw himself in
[1:36:19] the gap that's why he became the meekest
[1:36:21] man in all the earth
[1:36:23] but the scribes and pharisees they
[1:36:24] learnt the same word that moses received
[1:36:26] as revelation
[1:36:28] and they were stuffed shirts and they
[1:36:30] say wear it
[1:36:31] amen if the forerunner is going to come
[1:36:33] to anyone he'll come through us because
[1:36:35] we just got it just right and they had
[1:36:37] their clothes just right there the
[1:36:38] outward form just right so they learned
[1:36:41] it they learned the word and they became
[1:36:43] arrogant people moses received the word
[1:36:45] and he was the most meekest man in all
[1:36:46] the earth because of the revelation so
[1:36:49] the revelation produced a character in
[1:36:51] him
[1:36:52] and if that is the same back then it's
[1:36:54] sure going to be the same now
[1:36:56] i mean you say because to me
[1:36:58] this is me
[1:37:00] i don't necessarily listen to what
[1:37:03] people say god has revealed to them i do
[1:37:06] but i look at has it changed them
[1:37:08] amen because if it has changed them
[1:37:12] then it has been a real revelation
[1:37:14] hallelujah so god has been honing and
[1:37:16] molding us down
[1:37:19] amen
[1:37:20] remember
[1:37:22] you say well i don't know if i could
[1:37:23] really live up to that
[1:37:25] yeah you can
[1:37:26] not you
[1:37:28] get yourself brother brown said the
[1:37:30] greatest enemy i have is who
[1:37:32] william brown he didn't say satan he
[1:37:34] didn't say all of hell he said himself
[1:37:36] he says if i can get william branham out
[1:37:38] of the way god can do things that
[1:37:39] william brown knows nothing about
[1:37:42] amen and if that's if that is the case
[1:37:44] for the prophet it's sure the case for
[1:37:45] the bride of christ
[1:37:47] amen so there was a life on display and
[1:37:49] and that was shown because god was
[1:37:51] saying you're going to be like this
[1:37:53] not necessarily i'm not talking about
[1:37:54] the hunting and being a man in the
[1:37:56] wilderness and you know doing all and
[1:37:58] always driving a forward and all these
[1:37:59] things you know but um you know but
[1:38:02] there's some things the life he had
[1:38:05] now
[1:38:07] he makes a statement and why are people
[1:38:09] so tossed about actually sorry let's
[1:38:11] let's just read the scripture i just
[1:38:12] want to read a scripture here and
[1:38:15] from from the book of john
[1:38:18] chapter 11 because this is really where
[1:38:20] i want to get to
[1:38:23] now this is a story of lazarus man we
[1:38:25] know this very well i'm just going to
[1:38:26] read i'm just going to read we're going
[1:38:28] to read two scriptures 43 and 44 from
[1:38:30] john chapter 11.
[1:38:33] now notice as i said
[1:38:35] god only has uses your hands god uses
[1:38:38] your mouth
[1:38:40] god your uses you to work
[1:38:43] okay and not necessarily just the
[1:38:45] preachers he uses everyone
[1:38:48] okay everyone
[1:38:50] and then so he says and when he had thus
[1:38:52] spoken
[1:38:54] he cried with a loud voice lazarus come
[1:38:56] forth and he that was dead came forth
[1:39:00] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[1:39:02] and his face was bound about with a
[1:39:05] napkin
[1:39:06] and jesus saith unto them loose him and
[1:39:08] let him go
[1:39:09] so you see jesus spoke the word but it
[1:39:11] was actually the disciples that loose
[1:39:13] lazarus
[1:39:14] amen the disciples were used to take the
[1:39:16] grave clothes off of lazarus
[1:39:19] and we are living in our friends where
[1:39:21] there's a lot of grave clothes
[1:39:24] amen there's a lot of grave clothes
[1:39:26] you know people say people say well you
[1:39:29] know spiritual things they say there's
[1:39:30] no such thing as spiritual things
[1:39:32] you take an actor
[1:39:34] an actor gets into the spirit of his of
[1:39:36] his uh
[1:39:37] of his role
[1:39:39] yeah
[1:39:40] now there was a man called heath ledger
[1:39:42] i'm just going to use names because i'm
[1:39:43] sure i trust if you don't know who he is
[1:39:45] god bless you if you do well i trust you
[1:39:47] don't uh don't follow what he used to do
[1:39:49] but
[1:39:50] you know he he got into the role of
[1:39:52] joker you know a batman movie he became
[1:39:55] you know you know he was as as joker and
[1:39:58] he became so engrossed in the character
[1:40:02] that he actually embodied the spirit of
[1:40:04] that character so much he committed
[1:40:07] suicide
[1:40:08] i mean because of schizophrenic you know
[1:40:10] mentally possessed i mean i mean
[1:40:12] demon-possessed character and he stepped
[1:40:14] himself into that so strongly
[1:40:16] unfortunately that spirit took him to
[1:40:18] his grief
[1:40:19] and now there's a new film coming out
[1:40:21] this year
[1:40:23] and
[1:40:24] uh and the heroes of the film are joker
[1:40:26] and all like like the villains
[1:40:29] each of those characters i read an
[1:40:30] article each of the characters have to
[1:40:32] have their own psychologist
[1:40:34] to stop them getting too much into the
[1:40:36] character because they're afraid they're
[1:40:39] afraid that they will kill themselves
[1:40:41] like he did that the spirit of that
[1:40:44] character will take them that that'll
[1:40:46] take them to an early grave
[1:40:48] now if that is if that is the negative
[1:40:52] how much more the positive
[1:40:54] i mean how much more the positive where
[1:40:56] the spirit because you can ask i'll just
[1:40:58] say brother matu when he used to be a
[1:41:00] elvis i'm sorry brother i'm just going
[1:41:01] to use you for an example
[1:41:04] i should have maybe asked he used to be
[1:41:06] an elvis impersonator you asked him what
[1:41:08] it was like after the show this is
[1:41:10] before the lord found him and set him
[1:41:12] free you ask him what it was like and
[1:41:14] then he'll begin to understand why you
[1:41:16] know you know celebrities of the world
[1:41:19] they get strung out on drugs and they
[1:41:21] try and escape this thing that's
[1:41:23] tormenting them you see people in the
[1:41:25] world they have no peace you can see it
[1:41:27] in their face there's no peace in the
[1:41:29] world
[1:41:30] why is that because they're in darkness
[1:41:32] hallelujah they're they're covered in
[1:41:34] grave clothes
[1:41:36] amen but you have what's in you that you
[1:41:38] can take those grave clothes off of them
[1:41:41] loose them and let them go
[1:41:42] hallelujah and i'm gonna and that this
[1:41:44] is not pie in the sky
[1:41:46] amen but there's ways that can be done
[1:41:49] you have to be look
[1:41:50] don't look at the situation for what it
[1:41:52] is
[1:41:54] oh this person's this way and this is no
[1:41:56] you got to look beyond
[1:41:57] hey when jesus saw legion as i said
[1:42:00] about
[1:42:01] he didn't just say oh this is a you know
[1:42:03] this man deserves this and look at his
[1:42:04] own fault and maybe it was his own fault
[1:42:08] before god opened your eyes you're
[1:42:10] walking according to the spirit of this
[1:42:12] world the prince of the power of the air
[1:42:15] whether you were sitting in it raised in
[1:42:17] a message church you are still governed
[1:42:18] by that spirit but then one day but god
[1:42:21] rich and mercy
[1:42:22] one day set you free
[1:42:24] amen and many times i know my own self
[1:42:27] it was my own fault i did what i did
[1:42:29] i mean i because i agreed to it yeah
[1:42:31] let's do this
[1:42:32] amen
[1:42:34] and whether we like it or not that's how
[1:42:36] it is but lazarus no but jesus
[1:42:38] he looked beyond his situation
[1:42:41] and he set him free
[1:42:43] there was an opportun legion had his
[1:42:45] opportunity he was a demon-possessed man
[1:42:47] that was naked living in the tombs no
[1:42:49] man could bound him but yet god gave him
[1:42:52] grace to come at his feet come down and
[1:42:54] sit at his feet and he was delivered
[1:42:58] amen
[1:42:59] that same power
[1:43:01] that same power to set the captives free
[1:43:04] is in you
[1:43:05] amen that same power is in you to set
[1:43:07] the captives free because if we say the
[1:43:11] grain is grain has come to its maturity
[1:43:14] that's more than just saying quotes and
[1:43:16] quoting scriptures and going to church
[1:43:18] it's a life
[1:43:19] it's an everyday life that is lived
[1:43:22] and that starts in the home and and it
[1:43:24] works out
[1:43:26] you got to look at the big picture you
[1:43:27] take for example and i just for some
[1:43:29] reason this just came to me
[1:43:31] you know
[1:43:32] you got to look at the root cause of
[1:43:34] everything so for example you go into
[1:43:36] the home
[1:43:37] you got a little girl she doesn't want
[1:43:39] to wear skirts anymore
[1:43:41] i want to wear shorts i want to wear
[1:43:42] pants
[1:43:43] now if you just look at the thing itself
[1:43:46] you will you will put her under your
[1:43:48] thumb
[1:43:49] you'll say you listen here this is a
[1:43:51] sanctified home to god
[1:43:53] and you're not allowed to wear that here
[1:43:56] okay that sounds all very self-righteous
[1:43:58] and good
[1:43:59] amen and sure there must be a standard
[1:44:02] but listen you got to go beyond the root
[1:44:05] what is the root what is causing that
[1:44:08] amen because if you if you find the root
[1:44:10] cause
[1:44:12] if you can find the root cause then
[1:44:13] there can be a deliverance
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:16] and so what happens now is people
[1:44:18] are looking for identity
[1:44:21] yeah everyone is looking for a place to
[1:44:23] belong
[1:44:24] everyone is looking for a place to
[1:44:26] belong
[1:44:27] and that doesn't and we understand that
[1:44:29] that that being a believer you're burst
[1:44:31] into it there's no natural birth it's a
[1:44:33] spiritual birth so it doesn't matter who
[1:44:36] your parents are or you could trace your
[1:44:37] lineage back wherever you're going to be
[1:44:40] born again
[1:44:41] and that's the only way you'll find true
[1:44:43] belonging is when you have a real birth
[1:44:46] and so now everyone's looking for a
[1:44:47] place of belonging
[1:44:49] and you know it's a simple question why
[1:44:51] do people join a gang i'm still talking
[1:44:53] about the little girl
[1:44:54] okay but why do people join a gang
[1:44:57] motorcycle gang because they want a
[1:44:59] place of belonging they want to be
[1:45:01] accepted they want to find a place where
[1:45:03] there's a bit of you know brotherhood or
[1:45:05] whatever you know
[1:45:07] you know why do people
[1:45:09] you say well i never joined a motorcycle
[1:45:11] gang
[1:45:12] everyone's in a gang
[1:45:15] amen they might not wear a patch but
[1:45:17] everyone's in a gang
[1:45:19] you take you take gym jockeys always at
[1:45:21] the gym working out
[1:45:23] they found their place of acceptance
[1:45:25] oh you can do so many push-ups and
[1:45:27] whatever more and you know and then and
[1:45:29] they they actually find this is me
[1:45:32] you find someone who's addicted to
[1:45:34] lots of sport and stuff
[1:45:35] they've joined a gang
[1:45:37] this is their place of acceptance
[1:45:39] i mean you take computer gamers you take
[1:45:41] gamers and that's a spirit amen you take
[1:45:44] hey i used to be under that spirit but
[1:45:46] god set me free
[1:45:48] but that's a place because oh i'm not
[1:45:50] accepted with with with all the sports
[1:45:52] stars so i'll hear some people that
[1:45:54] accept me for me
[1:45:56] amen you take business people career
[1:45:59] people
[1:46:00] why do
[1:46:02] why do houses become divided families
[1:46:04] become divided because one of the
[1:46:06] spouses finds their identity in
[1:46:09] something else
[1:46:11] in in in that career or this job
[1:46:14] and they say but you know and then
[1:46:16] that will if if the ambition is wrong i
[1:46:20] mean there may be a real ambition but i
[1:46:22] want to pursue a career what's it going
[1:46:24] to do to your family
[1:46:27] what's it going to do to the rest of
[1:46:28] your life because you've only got 24
[1:46:30] hours in a day we all need to sleep at
[1:46:32] some time
[1:46:33] amen and so if you pursue something
[1:46:36] something's going to suffer
[1:46:38] i mean something will suffer if you
[1:46:40] pursue something
[1:46:41] and so but then some people well then
[1:46:43] what happens is now there's division in
[1:46:45] the family but then these people at work
[1:46:46] accept me
[1:46:48] what happens they've joined a gang
[1:46:50] corporate people
[1:46:52] you know
[1:46:53] and that's the same thing with religion
[1:46:56] people join a gang
[1:46:57] why do you think churches are seeker
[1:46:59] friendly
[1:47:00] because while we're accepting
[1:47:03] jesus is always accepting but he doesn't
[1:47:04] leave you how you are
[1:47:07] the woman caught an adultery she said he
[1:47:09] said where's your accusers she says lord
[1:47:12] i have none
[1:47:13] he says neither do i condemn thee go and
[1:47:15] sin no more
[1:47:16] whenever someone was delivered he said
[1:47:18] go and sin no more
[1:47:20] amen
[1:47:21] so you know some people they just but
[1:47:23] it's you know it's a gang
[1:47:26] so now you've got to look at now why is
[1:47:28] my child doing certain things because
[1:47:30] they see at school or maybe they're
[1:47:32] friends
[1:47:33] oh they can do these things
[1:47:35] amen and maybe they feel that those
[1:47:38] children are more loved than your
[1:47:39] children
[1:47:41] and so what happened they'll gravitate
[1:47:42] towards the other family because they
[1:47:44] want to have what they have
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:47] so you've got to look at the root cause
[1:47:49] of it the root cause is not they want to
[1:47:51] be rebellious
[1:47:52] but they're looking for identity
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:56] now if you can look beyond the
[1:47:57] circumstances jesus looked beyond the
[1:47:59] brother branham here's the prophet of
[1:48:01] god
[1:48:02] raise the dead
[1:48:04] thousands healed in south africa one
[1:48:05] time one prayer
[1:48:07] you know all these all these tremendous
[1:48:08] things spoke a storm out of existence
[1:48:10] life was created life was given back
[1:48:12] power spoken word
[1:48:14] and then he comes in home
[1:48:15] sister meters all
[1:48:17] uh fluctuated there's people in the
[1:48:19] house waiting to see brother barum young
[1:48:21] kids are all fussing and you know all
[1:48:23] crying and hungry and you know he goes
[1:48:26] in there
[1:48:27] remember
[1:48:29] this is this is this is a mature part of
[1:48:31] the field
[1:48:32] this is a mature part of the field
[1:48:35] and then so the house is in all disarray
[1:48:38] and uh you know meters oh there's all
[1:48:40] these people in the house that you know
[1:48:41] we haven't had anything to eat all day
[1:48:43] the children all upset all these things
[1:48:44] and he's just praying in his heart
[1:48:46] lord change the atmosphere in the home
[1:48:49] send in your holy ghost now change
[1:48:50] everything and he just just doesn't
[1:48:52] stand there and pray he's practicing his
[1:48:54] heart he puts on an apron remember he's
[1:48:56] looking at the big picture because if he
[1:48:58] was now reminded say a woman sort out
[1:48:59] these kids that's your office to look
[1:49:01] after these children
[1:49:03] sort it out that's what he yo someone
[1:49:05] who's just narrow-minded in their vision
[1:49:08] because you know but he looked you know
[1:49:10] put on an apron
[1:49:12] he says honey i saw a dress downtown oh
[1:49:15] yeah you look so nice in it and he
[1:49:17] begins to do the dishes
[1:49:19] and then what happens soon the kids
[1:49:20] start to settle down now
[1:49:22] mida became a little bit yo was all
[1:49:24] relaxed again
[1:49:26] what happened
[1:49:29] i could say this and i hope i'm not
[1:49:31] going too far with this
[1:49:33] but satan was trying to put grave
[1:49:34] clothes on
[1:49:35] a family
[1:49:37] because grave clothes bind
[1:49:39] they hold people
[1:49:41] that's why the body you know because
[1:49:42] they didn't have uh coffins like we do
[1:49:44] they bind up the body and then they put
[1:49:47] it in the tomb
[1:49:48] amen so now
[1:49:50] if he came into the home as i said and
[1:49:52] just laid down the law
[1:49:54] well the family would have been bound up
[1:49:58] amen
[1:49:59] so here was a man remember this is and
[1:50:02] brother makes a statement
[1:50:05] he says the anointing
[1:50:08] says
[1:50:09] why are people so tossed about
[1:50:12] he says and now we would think if such
[1:50:13] an anointing was on him he had been
[1:50:15] prophesied 800 years before
[1:50:18] uh that it would come and here he was
[1:50:20] with that type of anointing the full
[1:50:23] blessing and anointing of the lord was
[1:50:25] upon him
[1:50:26] we would have to now we would have
[1:50:30] uh we would have want to run all over
[1:50:33] the buildings holla but the bible said
[1:50:35] he laid down the scroll remember we read
[1:50:37] that
[1:50:38] and sat down and precious words
[1:50:40] proceeded from his mouth
[1:50:42] that's what he'd done under the
[1:50:44] anointing the anointing is not emotion
[1:50:47] but remember anything without emotion is
[1:50:48] dead
[1:50:49] amen
[1:50:51] the anointing is not a motion the
[1:50:52] anointing is supreme power and control
[1:50:56] knowing exactly what and how
[1:51:00] so i say when the prophet came into his
[1:51:01] home there that was that was the
[1:51:04] anointing
[1:51:05] was there supreme power's under control
[1:51:08] to know
[1:51:09] knowing exactly what and how to do
[1:51:12] amen
[1:51:13] sometimes we think it's some big great
[1:51:15] and it is sometimes god pours the spirit
[1:51:18] you can barely do anything
[1:51:20] but
[1:51:21] most of the time you say well i'm
[1:51:23] anointed that's supreme power under
[1:51:24] control
[1:51:26] amen that in every situation in life
[1:51:30] the lord will say this is what it is
[1:51:33] amen this is what's going on here
[1:51:36] amen you know you see
[1:51:40] people
[1:51:42] if they uh i'll just say it
[1:51:45] many times we see
[1:51:46] sisters and they want to be really
[1:51:48] dressed up and they should be you know
[1:51:50] look pretty
[1:51:52] but sometimes it can be done because
[1:51:54] they're scared the husband will look at
[1:51:55] worldly women
[1:51:57] amen and will cause him to leave her
[1:52:01] so she begins to dress the wrong way
[1:52:02] because she's afraid that he will leave
[1:52:06] amen
[1:52:08] and then now if the
[1:52:10] if the husband wants her to actually
[1:52:13] you'd say dress modestly according to
[1:52:15] the word
[1:52:17] he's not actually identifying the root
[1:52:18] cause
[1:52:20] amen because the root cause is not
[1:52:22] because she's wanting to be worldly the
[1:52:24] root causes she's afraid he'll leave
[1:52:27] is this okay
[1:52:29] amen you've got to look at you've got to
[1:52:30] look at the root cause of it all
[1:52:32] amen because remember what god
[1:52:37] the husband is like god and the woman
[1:52:39] the the wife is like the bride
[1:52:42] amen
[1:52:43] god jesus
[1:52:46] he gave himself
[1:52:48] for us
[1:52:50] and there was a purpose that he gave
[1:52:52] himself
[1:52:53] it says in titus 2 and 14
[1:52:55] who gave himself for us that he might
[1:52:57] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[1:53:00] unto him a peculiar people zealous of
[1:53:02] good works in galatians 1 4 who gave
[1:53:05] himself for our sins that he might
[1:53:06] deliver us from this present evil world
[1:53:09] according to the will of god and our
[1:53:12] father
[1:53:13] so now
[1:53:14] it's their husband's responsibility now
[1:53:17] to do that for his family
[1:53:19] remember
[1:53:20] you loose them and you let them go
[1:53:23] amen you lose them
[1:53:26] and so now we don't have to die jesus
[1:53:29] died
[1:53:30] but there will be a life in us remember
[1:53:31] if if he is in us
[1:53:34] then he will want to redeem those that
[1:53:37] are lost through you
[1:53:39] brother makes a statement in in return
[1:53:42] in jubilee he says about a kinsmen
[1:53:44] redeemer he says a kinsmen redeemer
[1:53:47] picks up their bible
[1:53:48] goes out into the night to their lost
[1:53:50] brother to redeem them
[1:53:52] amen so he's not just saying jesus is
[1:53:55] our kingdom and redeemer he says you
[1:53:56] become a kinshin redeemer
[1:53:58] amen you can go to those who have the
[1:54:00] same spirit
[1:54:02] amen and you can actually be their kins
[1:54:04] and redeemer you can loose the grave
[1:54:06] clothes
[1:54:07] amen
[1:54:08] oh lord save them deliver them and god
[1:54:10] says you go
[1:54:12] i'm insufficient no you're not moses
[1:54:14] said that
[1:54:16] amen he said did i not make man's mouth
[1:54:18] to speak
[1:54:20] hallelujah amen that we have the ability
[1:54:24] to set people free
[1:54:26] but you have to look for what is really
[1:54:28] causing that
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:32] so brother bradham
[1:54:35] he did some unusual things
[1:54:37] one guy was he couldn't he couldn't kick
[1:54:40] smoking
[1:54:41] so you got another brother to buy this
[1:54:42] guy a box of cigarettes
[1:54:45] amen and the guy was delivered
[1:54:48] you know you may think well that's
[1:54:50] pretty out of the box god is out of the
[1:54:51] box
[1:54:52] you got to be led
[1:54:54] don't be afraid if you're led however
[1:54:56] god speaks to you just let him lead you
[1:54:59] don't be afraid
[1:55:01] and now so
[1:55:03] god heals
[1:55:05] in many ways
[1:55:06] remember because spiritual
[1:55:08] he'd say complexes or emotional
[1:55:12] wounds
[1:55:14] are often a lot harder to heal than
[1:55:16] physical wounds amen because a physical
[1:55:20] wound it begins to get well and it
[1:55:22] doesn't really bother you anymore
[1:55:25] but a spiritual wound can be healed
[1:55:28] but then the scar can plague you amen
[1:55:32] and to me that's a grave cloth
[1:55:35] amen
[1:55:36] remember lazarus was alive
[1:55:38] he wasn't dead anymore he was life in
[1:55:40] him but he was bound up by these things
[1:55:43] amen
[1:55:45] and he he he he walked out of the tomb
[1:55:47] but i imagine he probably couldn't walk
[1:55:48] all that well
[1:55:50] because he was bound up
[1:55:52] amen and some of us
[1:55:55] amen
[1:55:56] are walking
[1:55:58] but we're not walking like we really
[1:56:00] could walk if we weren't bound
[1:56:03] amen
[1:56:04] and we understand you know
[1:56:07] you know what you're wrestling he knew
[1:56:10] he was bound up
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:13] and you know what you wrestle with
[1:56:15] it doesn't make you less of a believer
[1:56:18] i mean lazarus was absolutely a believer
[1:56:20] i believe he's in the upper room
[1:56:22] amen he just went to the other side and
[1:56:23] saw abraham isaac and jacob and they
[1:56:26] wanted to kill him again he was like hey
[1:56:28] sure i don't want to be here amen
[1:56:31] because he knew he'd no doubt go back to
[1:56:33] their place
[1:56:34] so he was a believer but just because he
[1:56:36] was in that condition didn't mean he was
[1:56:38] less of a believer
[1:56:39] and sometimes we kind of get in our mind
[1:56:42] well if i'm really the bride i'll be
[1:56:43] always victorious
[1:56:45] i'll crest every wave
[1:56:46] sometimes you've got a submarine
[1:56:49] it doesn't mean you're less of a
[1:56:51] believer
[1:56:52] amen it doesn't mean you're weak in
[1:56:54] faith
[1:56:56] you know you read abraham you read the
[1:56:58] divine commentary of people's lives
[1:57:00] paul picks up paul picks up abraham he
[1:57:02] staggered not at the promise of god was
[1:57:04] strong giving praise that he was able to
[1:57:05] do that which he has promised you know
[1:57:07] the scripture but then you go back into
[1:57:09] abraham's life he backslid
[1:57:12] amen nearly you know nearly caused
[1:57:14] plagues to fall in egypt and all these
[1:57:15] places when he went down to guerrero in
[1:57:17] another place and the and the king
[1:57:19] wanted to marry his wife and before they
[1:57:21] went down abraham said tell her you know
[1:57:24] you know tell them that you're my sister
[1:57:26] and then one of the you know and then so
[1:57:28] the next day you know the king was going
[1:57:30] to marry sarah
[1:57:31] and god said to him you're dead man
[1:57:34] you're in your house
[1:57:35] what have i done
[1:57:37] you're going to marry my prophet you
[1:57:38] know you're going to marry a you know
[1:57:40] that is his wife
[1:57:42] he says i haven't you know i didn't he
[1:57:43] said you know that their sis you know
[1:57:45] brother and sister
[1:57:48] and
[1:57:49] you know and then so it was actually the
[1:57:50] king was more righteous than abraham
[1:57:54] a heathen king was more righteous than
[1:57:55] god's prophet brother abraham actually
[1:57:57] no god says to other kings he's my
[1:57:59] prophet get him to pray for you
[1:58:01] amen
[1:58:03] and we're the sons and daughters of
[1:58:04] abraham by faith
[1:58:06] amen think about it and so you have all
[1:58:08] his stumblings and his failings and all
[1:58:10] these different things
[1:58:12] and then here we are
[1:58:14] and we're exactly we're men and women
[1:58:18] we're human like he was human
[1:58:20] amen he had his faith oh you say well
[1:58:22] that was before calvary
[1:58:24] well
[1:58:26] god but we still live the same kind of
[1:58:28] life
[1:58:29] but god doesn't remember remember moses
[1:58:32] under the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:58:33] write about all of their failings and
[1:58:35] weaknesses but paul under the blood of
[1:58:37] christ could not write those same
[1:58:38] failings and weaknesses
[1:58:40] amen but they are they were flesh and
[1:58:42] blood like we're flesh and blood
[1:58:44] oh but we have the holy ghost we still
[1:58:45] fail
[1:58:47] brother i don't have the quote on me but
[1:58:48] i think it's in the lamb's book of life
[1:58:50] brother brown says god doesn't run his
[1:58:53] business haphazardly
[1:58:54] he wouldn't save you one day to lose you
[1:58:56] another day and he says he knew he he
[1:58:59] knows you'll fail and fall but he still
[1:59:02] saved you he's not a haphazard god
[1:59:05] amen so if so if the prophet if we can
[1:59:08] take that for ourselves
[1:59:10] well how much more can we take it for
[1:59:11] each other
[1:59:13] amen for our families amen can we take
[1:59:17] that same because we can take then say
[1:59:19] thank you lord i i'm you know even
[1:59:20] though i
[1:59:21] fail and the lord traps me i mean i mean
[1:59:23] the devil traps me and all kinds of
[1:59:25] things and you forgive me
[1:59:27] amen and then and then you and then it
[1:59:28] comes down to your family
[1:59:30] oh they did this and i can't really
[1:59:32] trust them because they did this and all
[1:59:34] these different things happen
[1:59:35] you know
[1:59:36] if you're forgiven you can forgive
[1:59:39] amen
[1:59:41] and that's why some people do not
[1:59:42] understand how others forgive others is
[1:59:44] because they're not forgiven they don't
[1:59:46] know they're forgiven yet
[1:59:48] amen
[1:59:49] so yo the merciful shall receive mercy
[1:59:54] you've got to look at the big picture oh
[1:59:55] someone's someone's struggling what's
[1:59:57] happening they're looking for identity
[2:00:00] and they're not going to
[2:00:01] you know love breaks down all barriers
[2:00:05] amen and many times we can put forth a
[2:00:07] front
[2:00:09] and then people are actually repelled by
[2:00:11] that front
[2:00:12] and then your children will do not want
[2:00:14] what you have because of a front
[2:00:17] amen
[2:00:18] the message there's nothing wrong with
[2:00:20] the message
[2:00:21] quite often it's actually how it's given
[2:00:24] many times it's how it's lived god is a
[2:00:26] god of love jesus was god's attribute of
[2:00:29] love
[2:00:30] and he gave and he didn't just say well
[2:00:31] i love him on everyone's fine he gave
[2:00:34] himself to deliver them
[2:00:36] amen and if that same life is in you
[2:00:38] you'll give yourself that people will be
[2:00:40] delivered
[2:00:41] it may take many it may take maybe an
[2:00:43] innocent may take a long time
[2:00:46] but look for the root cause of it all
[2:00:49] amen
[2:00:50] look for the root cause of it all
[2:00:52] because this is our and i'm just gonna
[2:00:54] i've no idea what the time is but i'm
[2:00:56] just gonna
[2:00:57] wind this down
[2:00:59] but he says you know he says an apple
[2:01:02] tree
[2:01:03] remember if we uh
[2:01:06] if we are remember the grain
[2:01:09] that is planted is the same grain that's
[2:01:11] grown
[2:01:13] they're not a different grain the grain
[2:01:15] that's planted is actually no greater
[2:01:16] than the one that's harvested it's
[2:01:18] exactly the same thing
[2:01:20] i mean a husband a man a woman married
[2:01:22] because they're the same species
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:26] jesus is looking for a part of himself
[2:01:28] the feminine part of himself
[2:01:30] so he's not looking just for
[2:01:32] people
[2:01:33] he's looking for a part of himself
[2:01:36] amen so if god and well how do i
[2:01:39] how do i know that he says my sheep know
[2:01:41] my voice a stranger they'll not follow
[2:01:44] i mean there's something in you that
[2:01:46] resonates when you hear the word
[2:01:48] and that and then brother baby makes a
[2:01:50] statement the bridegroom call will come
[2:01:51] right through this
[2:01:53] amen
[2:01:56] he says he says an apple tree
[2:01:59] the apple
[2:02:00] he says so i'll find where this is
[2:02:03] this is an um
[2:02:05] don't find the page
[2:02:10] this isn't the impartiable sin 54
[2:02:13] he says if a man says that he believes
[2:02:15] he must be a christian and walk in the
[2:02:17] way that he says he is
[2:02:19] see attribute the apple is not the tree
[2:02:23] it's the earth it's the attribute of the
[2:02:25] tree
[2:02:26] and because you lie steal cheat and
[2:02:27] smoke and do everything call yourself a
[2:02:29] christian is because you're not born
[2:02:30] again
[2:02:31] that's right it shows that that's the
[2:02:34] right kind of life you bear
[2:02:36] jesus said buy their fruits you shall
[2:02:39] know them
[2:02:40] you say that's pretty cutting but that's
[2:02:41] true the apple is the attribute of the
[2:02:43] tree
[2:02:45] amen so the life that is produced proves
[2:02:47] it's an apple tree
[2:02:49] amen and i'm not saying
[2:02:52] you must have everything perfect
[2:02:56] but you should look if we're being
[2:02:57] changed from glory to glory we become
[2:02:59] more like him
[2:03:01] and what did he do he gave himself he
[2:03:03] wasn't selfish
[2:03:05] he didn't say well i've got to live my
[2:03:06] life
[2:03:08] he gave us life
[2:03:10] amen as soon as he came into the
[2:03:11] ministry he just gave his life as the
[2:03:13] lamb
[2:03:14] amen and it didn't it didn't actually
[2:03:16] bother him
[2:03:18] he knew well i'll just say it this way
[2:03:20] he knew those would be in the upper room
[2:03:23] amen he knew those that would receive
[2:03:25] him later
[2:03:28] but many of the people that he healed
[2:03:29] were never in the upper room
[2:03:31] many of the people that were delivered
[2:03:34] didn't become believers and brother
[2:03:36] braham said i'll pray for anyone
[2:03:38] i remember all adam's race
[2:03:40] he didn't he didn't actually say well no
[2:03:42] they're not bride forget about it
[2:03:44] amen
[2:03:46] so it's the same thing with you people
[2:03:48] can come to you
[2:03:50] and they can ask you things
[2:03:53] and they'll have questions and you have
[2:03:55] a life in you that'll just give a word
[2:03:56] in season
[2:03:58] and that'll turn the whole course of
[2:03:59] their life
[2:04:01] amen i'm talking about every part of the
[2:04:03] body now
[2:04:04] amen do not think of what to say it's
[2:04:06] not like you're brought before trial but
[2:04:08] you don't need to think of what to say
[2:04:09] god will just drop it in your heart say
[2:04:11] this
[2:04:12] and even even many times god does things
[2:04:14] and it's only later we recognize it's
[2:04:16] god
[2:04:17] amen you take you take brother biscuit
[2:04:19] there with the uh you know they're
[2:04:21] hunting the grizzly and the cariboo with
[2:04:23] the 42-inch horns
[2:04:25] he is and and and brother brown tells
[2:04:27] him the whole version how it's all going
[2:04:28] to work out days before uh you know a
[2:04:31] young man in a green checkered shirt and
[2:04:33] that was brother biscuit and he had no
[2:04:35] idea that he was actually part of the
[2:04:36] vision and it was only at the end where
[2:04:38] he says there it is his brother and he's
[2:04:40] and then he and then he realized hey
[2:04:42] this is it we just lived out part of the
[2:04:44] word
[2:04:46] amen
[2:04:47] oh but that's that's that now you're the
[2:04:48] same
[2:04:50] many times because god the the faith
[2:04:53] that we have is the subconscious faith
[2:04:55] the life that we live is just it's just
[2:04:57] lived out
[2:04:59] amen
[2:05:01] so now
[2:05:03] if we if that is the sa yo if that is
[2:05:05] the case now
[2:05:06] you know
[2:05:08] we have i you know maybe i've just ran
[2:05:10] around the tree too many times but
[2:05:12] you know
[2:05:13] you have what you need
[2:05:15] to loose people
[2:05:18] amen you have it he told his disciples
[2:05:21] lose him let him go
[2:05:23] amen
[2:05:24] you got to recognize that god is god is
[2:05:28] waiting on you
[2:05:29] amen he's not waiting on someone else
[2:05:31] he's waiting on you
[2:05:33] well i just live in the back part of
[2:05:34] nowhere no one knows you he's waiting on
[2:05:36] you
[2:05:38] amen
[2:05:40] and god heals by love he heals by music
[2:05:43] he heals just by the preaching of his
[2:05:44] word you know he heals by prayer laying
[2:05:47] out of hands all different kinds of
[2:05:48] things god heals by these things you say
[2:05:51] there's a person that they just need god
[2:05:53] needs to deal with them
[2:05:55] and then many times we think well we've
[2:05:56] just got to give them the word how do
[2:05:58] you give them the word
[2:06:00] do you just quote scripture to them or
[2:06:02] or
[2:06:03] or quotes
[2:06:05] how you doing
[2:06:06] how's your day
[2:06:08] you know you know brother branham he was
[2:06:10] he was there and i uh said remember this
[2:06:12] is the anointing supreme power under
[2:06:14] control everyday things they're there in
[2:06:16] a restaurant the waitress is all grumpy
[2:06:19] and moody and huffy and all these things
[2:06:21] you know terrible service
[2:06:23] and he just says well maybe she just had
[2:06:26] a bad day
[2:06:28] oh no it can't be that natural
[2:06:29] absolutely
[2:06:30] and just gives her a five dollar tip or
[2:06:32] whatever it is the next time comes in
[2:06:34] how are you doing have a seat here we go
[2:06:37] amen
[2:06:39] amen
[2:06:41] oh that's the prophet the same life is
[2:06:43] in you
[2:06:45] i mean can you put yourself in someone
[2:06:47] else's shoes
[2:06:49] amen because normally we would think man
[2:06:51] the service the whoever's the manager is
[2:06:52] doesn't train these people right and
[2:06:54] this is all wrong and
[2:06:56] he just said maybe she just had a bad
[2:06:58] day
[2:06:59] amen
[2:07:01] and then someone you say this person
[2:07:02] needs a real correction
[2:07:05] you say well give them the word
[2:07:07] go up to them how you doing
[2:07:09] how's everything going welcome so good
[2:07:12] to see you
[2:07:14] amen isn't the lord wonderful
[2:07:16] amen great nap just just just talk to
[2:07:18] them love them
[2:07:20] love them
[2:07:22] amen because if you cause an outward
[2:07:24] conformity the end part's not changed
[2:07:28] amen but if love is prejudice projected
[2:07:30] sovereign grace steps in
[2:07:33] amen oh that's brother branham no it's
[2:07:35] you
[2:07:35] that was demonstrated to prove god is
[2:07:37] going to do in
[2:07:38] you amen you can't put these stories
[2:07:41] just on the prophet
[2:07:43] amen you got to put it on yourself when
[2:07:45] love is projected i'm sorry hornets i
[2:07:48] didn't mean to bump your you know
[2:07:50] bump where you're living so simple
[2:07:52] things
[2:07:53] but supernatural things
[2:07:55] amen
[2:07:57] hallelujah
[2:07:59] so you know you've got to look at the
[2:08:00] big picture
[2:08:01] what is your vision remember where
[2:08:03] there's no vision isn't i'm going to
[2:08:04] close with this where no vision is the
[2:08:06] people perish the scripture says
[2:08:08] and that's just not well we're taking a
[2:08:10] rapture okay we are taking a rapture
[2:08:12] well i want my family there okay i want
[2:08:14] my family there well then what are you
[2:08:17] if you don't have a vision how that's
[2:08:18] going to take place
[2:08:21] well then how are you going to get there
[2:08:23] amen i said i want to fly to
[2:08:26] canada
[2:08:27] well i need money and i need a ticket
[2:08:29] now i need to book the ticket you can't
[2:08:30] just say i want to fly to canada you got
[2:08:32] to have everything in place to get there
[2:08:35] so if you look at the big picture now
[2:08:37] because remember satan all he wants to
[2:08:39] do this is what satan wants to do have
[2:08:41] us all divorced that are married
[2:08:43] amen he wants all of our children on
[2:08:45] drugs or committed suicide someplace
[2:08:48] that's what he wants for you that's what
[2:08:50] satan's wanting to do
[2:08:52] amen
[2:08:53] but what is god wanting to do
[2:08:56] because remember
[2:08:58] jesus said to peter
[2:09:00] the satan has desired to sift you
[2:09:03] but i have prayed
[2:09:05] amen that when your temptation comes
[2:09:06] he's going to say he's going to try and
[2:09:08] sift you it's still going to happen
[2:09:09] but he says i have prayed that when he
[2:09:12] tries that you will not fail
[2:09:15] amen
[2:09:16] so god said no this is not going to
[2:09:18] happen
[2:09:19] and there's a prayer line
[2:09:20] where a young woman comes in and i don't
[2:09:22] have the quote on that but but a young
[2:09:24] girl a young woman comes in front of the
[2:09:26] prophet
[2:09:27] and he says it's just time of life and
[2:09:29] all these things and i think she's got
[2:09:30] cancer and all these things and and he
[2:09:32] praises satan has desired to sift her
[2:09:36] but we've prayed now
[2:09:38] and it's over
[2:09:40] amen
[2:09:42] and so it's the same thing in families
[2:09:45] satan will try and sift you and destroy
[2:09:47] you
[2:09:48] we don't fight an imaginary you know i'm
[2:09:50] sure we can all agree
[2:09:52] yeah we all know the devil is real
[2:09:54] amen that's not a debate
[2:09:56] and if he is real therefore he has an
[2:09:58] intent and that is to destroy you
[2:10:00] to have you isolated
[2:10:02] amen to destroy your families but then
[2:10:05] if you have a vision
[2:10:07] my family is going to be there
[2:10:09] we're all going to be there on that day
[2:10:12] then you say lord help me to live a life
[2:10:14] that will draw my family
[2:10:17] i mean draw my family into that place
[2:10:18] that they take a rapture i don't want my
[2:10:21] family to go up in the second
[2:10:22] resurrection before the great white
[2:10:23] throne
[2:10:25] if they receive mercy then praise the
[2:10:27] lord but i want them to go on a rapture

[2:12:10] be walking or if they're an unbelief
[2:12:12] whatever it is that's grave clothes
[2:12:14] amen you've got to look at the big
[2:12:16] picture
[2:12:17] remember husband and wife should be one
[2:12:19] and everything
[2:12:21] amen
[2:12:23] and remember the enemy is never your
[2:12:25] spouse the enemy is never your children

[2:13:38] or your children
[2:13:40] you recognize they're part of the same
[2:13:43] body
[2:13:44] i mean because god doesn't like division
[2:13:47] amen
[2:13:48] he wants all of himself together all of
[2:13:50] his attributes together
[2:13:53] so we should strive for that kind of
[2:13:54] unity around the word

[2:13:58] witness
[2:13:59] that you know that's the son of god
