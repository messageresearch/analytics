the anything there Thank You musicians you guys are all so what would we do without you I I love you so much god bless you they just open up the you know word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father no there's not much that we can do Lord but we can just surrender ourselves to you Lord the reason why we come here every evening the Lord is because we love you and we we want to fellowship with who you Lord and we just want you to minister unto us because we've got needs and questions hello that we sometimes need answers Lord and we are said tonight that this very sermon Lord and and anything that I can bring forth Lord you take that sword because it's your soul Lord cuz I'm not a salt producer Lord I'm just a sword Lord great I'm not a soul creator but I can just only take the thoughts that comes from you Lord and lay it in front of your Lord and ask the Holy Ghost to anoint the word and to bring it into everyone's heart Lord in season so I pray Lord even with the children tonight Lord may they enter in my all of us to leave the work week just a bit behind the Lord and just come in faith Lord and and just for this little bit of time Lord come and worship you in all truth and life Lord everyone that's not yet tonight Lord we miss them and we ask that your blessing be with him as well hello and thank you so much for this fellowship and just the time to spend in your word and share your word Lord I pray that you will anoint this word tonight Lord and you will be done here on earth he's in heaven we pray this all in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen her brother Ben can you just do me a little bit down here on the fall peg please see if this works there we go well we're gonna first before I get you all to sit I just want to first tell you what am I going to speak about tonight and then we'll open the scripture and then you all can receive it I wanted tonight speak about personality versus character so there's a lot and and what I want to show you is there is so big difference between someone's personality and someone's character and I want to show you that when we Christians character is very important it is absolutely crucial to a walk as a Christian for everything we do so hopefully after tonight you'll see that it's good to have a personality but we need God's character so let's turn our Bibles to 2nd Corinthians 4 and we're going to read they just verse 18 I got it on the screen for you praise the Lord they say when you always mean it says yeah while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen amen and but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal so children what temporal means is it has an int okay it's only a little space of time and everything that you see now will have an end okay but the things which are not seen are eternal we ask that the Lord will bless this word and add is basing to this word you all can be seated and I was nervous but then I spoke to a brother in the tooth brother beam god bless you and it just dawned that you're family so I can just be myself so I'm not gonna bring something massive from something there's this this deep thing I'm just gonna be me and I pray that you will see it that this is not me this is just the sort and I'm gonna deliver the sort and I'll pray that the Holy Ghost will just show it in your heart and you young children this is where you can get your blessing you only need a sentence in season or a word in season I remember when brother Isaac he preached about resolved I remember that sermon brother Isaac and it was one word and it changed a lot for me that night so even if you just keep the one word go with that I okay so don't miss your blessing so this let's kick away because I've got 18 slides but I'll run fast through them so if we look at this this is my and the reason why if the the thing is I made all these notes and it doesn't show on thee so I have to follow the computer so sorry about that so we look at the stream so all your kids this is a lovely tree so this is representing a believer okay so when I look at this tree I see nice above the ground I see nice green leaves and I see apples in it or fruit or you can even have peaches if you want and I see some nice green grass and leaves and it just looks so good so when I look at this tree I know the Bible says by the fruit that you Bay you shall be you that so be a record to what you believe but there is a lot of fight people that look like this that act like this that deceive you because it sees in the Bible that in this time the two will be so close together the Spirit of God and the spirit of Satan will be so close together that it will deceive the very elect that Eve was possible so what I want to show you tonight is not just to look at the fruits don't just look at the personality but I want you to see what is underneath the ground and where you put your roots because where you put your roots is what's gonna hold you in the wind blows when the storm comes when the waters sweeping past you way you of where you believe is is attached where you are founded upon that rock that's what's going to keep you and nothing will move you so don't always just look at the personality because a personality can be deceiving Amen so let's jump in this praise the Lord so I have to get a personality so I got the definition of personality it's very small oh you can see it I can see it I'll read it yeah but I'll just read the past that that makes for me that that describes a personality so it says that a personality is made of up of characteristics patterns of thoughts and feelings and behaviors that make a person unique ok Amen so your personality makes you a very unique person so here's a picture for you like that ok this frog I couldn't get a better frog that's cool cuz all the other frogs are bad but this frog has got personality so the reason I put it up like that is first of all it's an ugly frog second of all it's all about all the colors that he could have it's got cool glasses it's a cool frog it's like a frog that walks on eggs okay this is a cool frog if you look at this frog he has it all together he just knows he's got what the world calls today possess okay this frog is awesome but see this frog is only a personality okay I'll bring it into you into the thought now so that's what if you describe personality for me this is what I see okay now we're going to go to character and the very definition from character and I needed to show the picture because I'm gonna go one back I might not show the picture taken of course you might not like it but look at this frog okay so this frog how it is formed it's like when your personality is formed we you grow up so I grew up in the Free State and it's a very dry country very flat country so my personality can maybe be drawn flat but it's not what it is but where I grew up was a farming community so not much of this happens in a farming community okay though I've got a bubbly very nice personality sometimes when I grew up it wasn't always so because I want to bring it back so the area you live in affects your personality it can it can alter your personality it can it can give you a personality like I remember when we in the Free State we had people that was in the school called gray okay so Greg was a very it was like the next level college okay which is the best college you know you would say in Wellington like Scots college so and how you knew that someone was from grey as when he come and greet you ago I am a month I'm from grey and you're like I'm just Ricky and I'm from the Free State so it doesn't matter what but he was so proud of where he came from that that was part of his personality and everything that he spoke about will always go back to that school he'll always say I'm from gray and that gray we do it this way and so it was so engrained into him that it became part of his personality but if he wasn't in the Free State in gray that wouldn't be a part of it so your personality could be where you grow up forms a part of your personality okay your culture forms a part of your personality I'm a boogie I'm a free state we take it easy if something breaks we fix it with a number 8 wire and a shifting spanner you know and we can do everything with us anything can be fixed and everything is right but when you come from the town I pick up the phone about a breach stone yeah I've got a flat tire mate can you come and change this I'm sitting here next to the highway and that's how they work we're a free state that he gets on his knees and he's like span is going and wheels going is going on love you didn't pick the speed wheel in but I know someone and he phones he's friended the wrong size diet but that is how we grew up so my personality the try that I have is I don't give up no matter what this situation gives I know there must be somewhere answer but the guy in the city Hugo I'll phone afraid so that is also part of his personality the school you go to your brother and your sister good so form a part of your personality amen okay who's got brothers and sisters okay who loves the brothers and sisters amen who sometimes thinks they are so annoying amen so even that very brother and sister that you have with you can form a part of your personality can give you complexes you can you can react a certain way my brother used to be taller than me so every time when I get to him he would either flick my ear or rub my head so after a while if I walk in the door my brother comes and then because I don't do it anymore but that became a part of who I was okay so I'm not gonna stretch it even your enemies form a part of your personality how you react in conflict so when somebody attacks you and you like get on the defense quickly because you used to it so it is a part of you put a personality and you get some other people something happens and they just sit back and go well what just happen and they so calm and you can not understand what they're doing but it's part of the personality so now we go to the the next one character okay this is this is where it is and so the definition of character says that it's the mental and moral qualities that's distinctive to an individual so mental and moral but I want to say character goes much deeper than just a mental and a moral quality it's something that's here right inside of you it's something that comes out when I don't want to jump ahead but it's something that comes up when when the water gets shaken it's something that just goes I shall not be moved and you can't fake it you cannot fake it character you can't fake personality you can fake character you can so praise the Lord so I say we want today we want the Holy Ghost character we want the character of Jesus Christ okay this is not a preaching this is actually what we want because when Jesus was here on the earth and he was standing in front of a devil and the Devils were challenging and the Pharisees and the Sadducees were challenging on every corner he didn't run around he just was stoned and he waited because he said I couldn't do nothing until the father shows me say he was just waiting and he didn't bow to anyone and everywhere he went he's character everybody knew the character of Jesus Christ they knew when he was coming they were looking forward to him coming they knew that this man could cost our demons this man can't lie so he's he's very character with before him not just his personality but his character so now let's bring this all in here we go so this is what we want in proverbs 3 1 2 7 it says how cuz I want to know how can I get this character of God how can I get such a character that we're not deal with people that they see God and not just a personality you can't have a personality there's nothing wrong with it but we need that character so in proverbs 3 verse 1 to 7 it says they my son forget not my law but let thy heart keep my Commandments for the length of days and a long life and peace shall be and peace shall they add to thee so that's the commandments of the law so that's just following the law of God that's all good but here's where it comes he says let not mercy and true forsake thee bind them about the neck write them on the table of thine heart so when God is speaking to you and mercy comes your way and you see that this is more than a man speaking and this word is coming to talk to me and it's teaching me something and sometimes when the Lord speaks to you it hurts and pride comes in and and things come in and you just don't want to let it go cause we as humans or personalities are pretty hard to break but God is giving you something and is saying you need to address this lid not the mercy of God and the truth of God note forsaken goes mercy of God is when God brings you revelation and it's through a brother or a sister that's it's something maybe and it hurt you and now God goes what are you gonna do with it you have a choice now you can get character or you can just mess this whole thing so when somebody say something to you when when a brother or a sister anyone says something to you or even a situation happens you get retreats to anything God says what are you gonna do with it what are you gonna do with what I just gave you because God will not give it to you if you cannot handle it but he wants you to see do you want character or do you want to bail out and be a personality so then it says thou shall find favor and and good understanding in the sight of God and of men trusting the Lord was all thy heart and lean not unto thine own understanding don't try to figure it out don't try to understand it just lean unto God he says and in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise in thine own eyes okay because what you see is not always what's out there Hollywood is the biggest fake in the world what you see on that screen is not what is on that screen you see only what the best picture and the best shot that they could do that's what you see brother Isaac when you did your music video and you edited it you would only pick the scene that you wanted to see in your head but all the other scenes you delete in throw away because you don't need them because that wasn't part of what he visualized but and you might look at that video and think man that's awesome music video but it took him so many hours of recording and it took him so many hours of editing to bring that and that's what Hollywood is it's fake if you take all that veneer off you'll see a green screen here and a boom mic yeah and a camera then five guys running around here but the cameras only focused on what they want you to see don't be fooled Hollywood is fake everything about it is fake okay though you are not gonna get anyway if you follow that I can promise you anyway okay doesn't matter how nice the story is it's not gonna get you anything right the Word of God alone can get you thing and I'm not saying sit in your Bible night and day and try to read and understand it walk with God okay he says and fear the Lord and depart from evil so this is instruction this is when you walking and something comes your way and you think whoa why shouldn't maybe be doing this you should turn around and walk away from it easier say don't even take entertain it don't think about it don't try to explain it or rationalize it just walk away you don't need that you don't need it it's not with you it says you be not wise the Bible says that the children of this world okay Satan's Eden is more wiser than the sons of God okay so this very country at the moment is so proud that they've got more atheist in Christians they proud of it they proud that they can Google and anytime and find an instant answer which you will go and study in the word to show them the truth they don't care about that they want instant now okay google can't tell me what's going on now I just put it aside and I walk on they so wise you tell anybody of this world God is real they tell you you lying says show me God Weezy show me they want instant they can't wait they want instant okay so be careful did well go on I choose to believe the word and the Word of God I'll explain to you this while I say verse 4 he says so shall define favor and good understanding in the sight of God now when I was still in the world young people when brother and one didn't meet the Lord is I look the part I dress the part I said very required in church I didn't bother my mommy or daddy I didn't go every five minutes try to go to the bathroom was a good Christian I prayed I read my Bible but you know what I never understood God I never understood him how could Samson a lion roll up against Samson a lion man we're talking about a massive animal that a lion doesn't come to you say can I bite you oh you look so good I'm gonna bite you tonight no a lion when it's attacking it's going for the kill it wants to destroy you it doesn't reason it's an animal it doesn't reason with a human or with anything to say hi mr. zebra can you run a bit slower because I want to kill you it goes for the kill and it kills so here's a man walking no weapon nothing in the middle of the desert or whereever he walk and this lion attacks him and it goes and he rips this lion's mouth open like a rag have you seen the canines on the lion brother Bob yeah okay you don't stick your hand in the lion's mouth and go oh I think I'm gonna get this oh well it's busy trying to attack you so I couldn't understand how could a man ripple line apart what's that it can't be true but see I never understood the anointing of God I never understood it because I never took the time to just walk with God and say Lord instead of me trying to figure it out just show me I don't understand it you show me Caicos and I don't want to go revelation and it's all but your personal walk with God it's not about you brother and your sister your mother and your father it's you not understanding something and you go Lord I just don't understand this would you show me okay I don't want to go of subject but I didn't understand God I was 32 years old and remember a lot of you young kids might not get to be 32 years old just remember that it's by the grace of God we get you so at the age of 32 I meet the Lord and he starts changing my world do I still do I now know everything now no I don't but I keep walking okay cuz I want character oops comes out alright this one so this is looking at the unseen see we don't want to look at what's around us right now we want to see what God's showing us we want to see the angels around us we want to absolutely see we god wants us to go we don't want to just see a car a house a road a next person and that but that that is not gonna help you in your walk with God a ball being kicked oh there's another car there's a bird flying we don't want to see just natural stuff we want to see God what do you want me to do for you we're gonna win a soul how can i impact someone's life that they know these are God I don't need to preach it but my life does okay so here we go it says when God made man he made him thus for we made him a little certain compartment in the man for his own throne this is right in the heart of man his control tower God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself doesn't want to wait for the Lord just want to lead himself he is therefore there is a war constantly not just every second day this is where I need your attention constantly does not stop brother and is brushing his teeth the devil comes in and tries to attack him yeah you always say it you say I'm brushing my teeth having a nice time and all of a sudden I have this mind battle going on constantly he will not let you go but you can overcome just keep on just keep on he says then man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes and that's where he is deceived that is we Satan deceived Eve by what she could see but the fruit was pleasing to thee hi okay she didn't understand it it was just Pleasant and she took from him but it was death to the soul so is it tonight God wants to lead man so he wants to make men a little control tower tower in the midst of his heart so that man be led by the Spirit of God getting out of his own leading is what separated him from fellowship looking what he could see with his eyes so now let me use your example here we've got Israel and they walking and and after everything God has done through Moses brought them through the desert they in the promised land they still walking and now all of a sudden they go we want the king you know cuz the Jebusites have the king and and I can't even remember all of it more vice every King everybody has a king the Philistines has a king everybody asking why can't we have a key we want a king they experienced all the miracles they've seen all these wonderful things blood water turning to blood they saw flies coming they saw so many miracles bread falling out of the skies now all of a sudden they want a king I want a king because what are they looking at and the other people that one drives this nice car and this one can go like this and that one that they looking around not at the unseen so they're just looking around and then they go to Samuel they say we want a king like this and Samuel wants them and say you don't really want that guy you want God leading you you don't want that guy how many times children has you dad said to you you don't really want to make that decision you don't want to really follow that guy that's not good for you man stay away from it and you just go yeah right he's so boring he doesn't know it's my friend I know him yes he's here he's hanging halfway down his Johnny shirt then he walks like this when he comes into the room and he's off his pants is up but he's a cool dude really okay I think you believe that not a cool dude cool doesn't get you anyway since and that is where he stands here tonight and those who are led by such things by the scripture it says the sons and the daughter of God are led by the Spirit of God your emotions is your control it sounds hard but I'm gonna bring it all in now your emotions is your control okay and you can take and you can notice a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they can never please God but a man or a woman that will not look at the things of the world but just go according to the leading of the Spirit they're usually in the world of God amen that is the great fight tonight Satan took the eyes a man's head to control him but God looked at the heart okay so here's David and his brothers and I want to bring this story because we all like David and his brothers you know if Samuel comes into the house and he says okay the brothers standing now right in front of Samuel the Prophet he needs to go and find David - anointed king and all the brothers like everybody says look at the biggest brother and he's going to be the one that he comes Boston he's the strapping lad and God says to settle not that one now then this has been preached so many times but but just catch this God doesn't look at what we see he looks at the heart he looks what's in here you cannot fake that because what is in your heart is character it's not personality it's character he says it eventually gets to David and David definitely doesn't look the part but there's something inside of David that God looked at and in God this the possible sees this is a man after my own heart amen so what will God see when he looks into your heart this might be this might be just something I want to drop in here if you stand right before God now what will God see when it looks into your heart now I'm gonna bring it in this is why I asked you this question and I'm not far away to thing indeed man's always trying to achieve something by his head he is supposed to achieve but by his heart you're not supposed to figure it out you're not supposed to over explain it you're supposed to believe in the Word of God that is the control tower where God wants to control him he directs his store he directs his walks he directs his emotion so this is why I said we lit by emotion but God directs that emotion so if you get excited and sure it's God making you excited in church if you want to cry it's God wanting you to cry don't you don't be ashamed of it your emotions as part of you don't get cold and starchy and when somebody moves next you got you removed again and cut you off this way in oh the arms are coming out again huh just be like this brother NDC singing again too loud oh I'm gonna miss tender stuff just let it be seriously let it be cause emotions proves that you know date seriously if you look in the car line in the floor you go cook and he just goes go maybe he's dead you go cook out okay that's that's today it's not he's a lot of you step away and he goes she heard me sorry might he's a lot you can see these something they but a date stick just sitting like this you could kick in the menus and move away kick you move away phrase the Lord move away praise the Lord move away oh I love him so much loving Wow cry do something let get give yourself to the Lord don't don't get starchy oh man I can't explain it he says yeah this is brother branham and I want you to listen to this sometimes I get so happy I just have to let it loose amen there's a woman in the service swinging a headband letting it go that happens in the church I could I can promise you there were some broads going oh oh you know let's just stay you know maybe she took it a bit before and the other guy will go yeah you know she threw a hand back a bit maybe she swung one the least time oh come on leave her be she's happy man leave it that way he says but here is where the trick come this is where the whole trick of the devil comes into course the moment that happens this is what the devil does he says and if I look around to see somebody then see I got my eyes upon people then yeah you miss your whole blessing you missed all placing because you're looking at people oh that one acted and that baby fall off the chain he's running again and you missing your blessing that preacher is preaching is hard out and you looking at a baby believe it be man if you kids if kids behave just you know these deacons for that they'll sort them out okay you just go get you blessing don't know how did the devil wrote your blessing he says but God helped me to keep my eyes closed so I encourage you when you're in church when you're sitting in a service and things happen close your eyes and just stay pray and say Lord I don't want to miss my blessing please don't let me miss my blessing because that very time why does Satan distract you because the preacher is about to say something that could help you and your walk and Satan comes boom and you go right and it goes from posture and you could have stopped that trial right there you could have stopped your trial right there but you chose to be fooled by a silly devil but he belongs under your feet so when something goes on in church and someone is yawning and the other one is falling asleep just leave them be you go get your blessing because if you go get your blessing you walked out bliss and you walked out change and God can do something to that okay but if you get cold and starchy and indifferent and looking here and having this excuses he cannot work in your life you can look at the unseen I want to be late by the Spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do with it Amen lord help us to do that I'm I skip over this and close here here we go this is I'll finish through this one and the Lord is good don't look at anyone look to God and if you can't see him look to the unseen okay seriously just keep looking that way close your eyes if you need to do anything bothers you close your eyes go on just praise the Lord you will get your blessing Jesus told Nicodemus once you see except a man be born again by the Spirit he cannot see the kingdom of God in other wise he made this you cannot understand the kingdom of God until you are born again so you have to make an effort first to accept it and then after you have accepted it you will be able to understand it how do you accept the world by saying Amen if a preacher preached something and you agree with it say Amen yeah okay is he fees busy keeping the devil a kick you go amen okay if this you is falling asleep don't say I mean don't okay but enter in because if you agree with it then you say I mean you stay awake when you listen to him and you say yeah that's it preacher you stay awake you entering in you taking you your show then you putting it behind the oxcart and you pushing and you're pushing because we're gonna get there but if you just stand to the next go that one could push harder and that one might do in the air you can pull a bit better and where you gonna stay the oxcart is moving you staying right there you haven't moved the meter you ain't getting any way with God you just staying right there and now this is where I want to go through this and I want to tell you this brother branham tells the story about the banner boy who knows the story was about better banner boy man I love this story and then he says about this is he is this watering hole the way the boys used to go and swim it says an after school in the summertime so when the spring starts and it goes into summertime they would run to this big pool of water to go and swim he says an Indy was this guy called the banner boy so how to choose the banner boy is the last one in is the next banner boy okay so if you're lost in the river or last in this in this pool you're the banner boy name so that means you have to go in first now the job of the banner boy is to check if the water's okay okay so brother Branham says he wasn't even the banner boy but he was the first one in amen so he says while the others are trying to get me clothes of man he was already in the water isn't you'll running you jump in and he says because the springs comes off the mountains the water the water comes off the mountains are flows into this big pool and the waters ice-cold so the sign was when you jump in and you're in the water you go this water is cold man because you need to know warn the other guys cuz you're the banner boy you raise up one finger and you go and that means hey boys treat carefully the water's cold okay so coming slowly but the next time when you run in you jump in the wood and the wood is nice and fine you raise up two fingers and you go boys the water's fine you could just jump on him okay so it's so is it with the gospel today the water is fine you can jump on in but you just have to give yourself don't be the one standing next to the river looking at this and going oh shoot I should not just jump in man jump in the gospel is fun man I never have one boring moment I think brother Andy said it I can't be bored I'm a Christian yeah you know if the Lord shows you a little thought man you can you can go with that forth for Daisy and the Lord just keeps opening up and keeps opening it up you don't need to preach but you can have joy you can say I mean you can stand up you can shout you can sing as long as it is in the spirit of the Lord amen so let us just all stand up just shake it all out and well well in the sermon here amen if you want to jump in you got a choice but you have to make the choice no preacher can help you make that choice no amount of words I tell you tonight young people and old people can make that choice you have to make it and what you have to do is just surrender your will surrender your heart and say lord help me I want my okay I want my blessing I want to walk like Enoch walked I want to have the heart of David but you have to make that choice I can't make it so we're gonna go now to prayer meeting if there's any prayer requests you can you can like before brother ping do you have any pre requesting or do we just go into pre meeting it's all right okay so let us all just bow our heads if you have a request you lift your hands to the Lord and you ask him for these phrases it's a very praising God and let's just all pray together but I want to ask you something when you prayed tonight to pray that the Lord will take your eyes and will give his eyes to you so when you look at things you'll see it different and if you ever look upon something that hurts your eyes look away because it hurts God's eyes as well amen so if you're looking at stuff you shouldn't look close your eyes and pray and say lord help me through this I don't want to look at it okay
