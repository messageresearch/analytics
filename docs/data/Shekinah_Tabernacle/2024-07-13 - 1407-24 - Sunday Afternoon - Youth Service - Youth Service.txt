bow our heads for before we read God's word uh Lord heavenly father I thank you Lord for this time we have together Lord Lord I pray work bre through me and get myself out of the way Lord I'm a little bit nervous here Lord so I just just pray you you take over and uh may be a blessing to God's people Lord I Thank you Lord for the opportunity obviously and um want to do my due diligence name of Lord Jesus Christ amen am amen um yeah so before before we sit down so Matthew chapter 6 uh 26 verse 30 um just make sure I have it my s and when they had sung A Hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives and then sath Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto the unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended and Jesus saith and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the Crow thou shal deny me Thrice and Peter said unto him though I shall die with the thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples um May the Lord add His blessings to the r of his words you may be may be seated um so a couple of weeks ago or a week or so ago um Ben asked me if I'd take a service I um thought I had successfully dodged the question and not answered um but he's resilient and uh made sure I answered and uh here we are so you can blame Ben for me being here basically that's what I'm saying but no I um obviously suitably nervous and um as it should be when you're talking to God's people there's a certain reverence and a and a um type of care you take with it um so yeah um right let's start okay so apart from that being the first reading I want to now switch to a different story and it's actually in Matthew 25 so uh no you don't need don't need to turn to it sorry it is not Matthew 25 it is yeah it is Matthew 25 there you go um story of the wise and foolish virgins now the story of the five five wise and five foolish virgins I'm hoping obviously the kids know I'm saying kids sor sorry anyone under 20 um knows the basic story of the um five wise and five foolish do we cool sweet you can tell me it then right so if I if we sort of just there's a group of them over here there's a few hiding over this side but um if I just sort of point to you I'm nervous already and I forget names as it is so don't get offended but if I point to you how about we start running through the the five wise and five fullest versions all right we good we good no you're not looking at me so what we'll [Laughter] do can we start with a preface what what how does the story start what do we start with stop there perfect that's what I want moving on one J know what do we got you got 10 virgins what's the difference between them M no no no next go next to five wise and fiveish thank you there we go so we got 10 virgins here so now just just sort of starting off we got five wise five foolish cool okay what moving along the seats what happens next mate what what are what are we what are we what are we aiming for for these virgins what what's the goal okay so they have they have oil yes and they have lamps yep so they've got oil and they've got lamps and they are burning their flames all right jump into the there you go you're right there remember your name okay so we've got we got five wise five foolish versions do you know the story darling are you just saying that or yeah anyone at the 20 put the hands up all right we'll come we'll come to the front we'll skip you so five wi five foolish we have lamps where do we go from there where's the story go no okay can I I'll I'll try and I'll try and catch up myself um okay okay so what's what's the difference between the five W and five foolish what what made them different do you remember give my here if I want they did so five the wise had spare oil great okay now what what are the the The Virgins what are they what are they waiting for what what is what is the the story in a of they were they were they were part of the wedding moving along so we got five wise five fullish they have oil they have lamps they're waiting for the um for the wedding and then what happens um the oil runs out yeah the oil runs out because the bridegroom carries he doesn't turn up on time wasn't a female this time it was the guy oh my it's getting hot in here okay so so the so so the cherry and the and the Flames all go out and then the C sorry I won't Jump Ahead what happens next so we're all waiting and everyone falls asleep you got five wise foolish five wise and they're all waiting for the bridegroom and then should we skip ah H that's right that's right skip ahe to the back what do we got no no no the the the younger ones I began to a birthday party I don't think you're quite memory fails me anyway okay okay so we all wait they're all waiting they fall asleep and then a call comes out yep they they do we've skipped the head a little bit so obviously the bridegroom we're waiting for him he finally the call comes out PR here let's go let's go and then they go we don't have enough oil well the the fil fullish don't so they don't have enough oil so yes they go to buy oil and what happens while they're buying oil yes staring straight at here G closes pretty much they they go and they're not allowed in so that's that's a basic quick run through of the story so I've got I've got a few notes um against against that that part of the story did no we won't read it um right so the kingdom of God is likened under 10 V likened unto 10 virgins Waiting for God so five wise and five foolish um quick precursor that's that's the the The Virgins they are not worshiping other gods they are not following Past Times They are in God's word as God's word it is now they're virgins they are pure they are absolute they are the best okay but says five wise and five foolish and not to put a scare or or a moment or anyone to look sideways but some people won't make it that's that's that's just it that's that's the run of the game it's you're called and you need to have the oil so the five foolish um took no extra oil now the oil is is the Holy Ghost amen that's that's the depiction of it in this in the story The Five wise and foolish virgins they had oil they both had oil both they they both sets had lamps do we do we know what a basic old oil lamp looks like you know the idea of it yeah okay so so it's a bowl well the really basic version of it is a bowl and they can make it out of clay Humanity but they can make it out of clay or whatever they want and they fill it with oil put a little bit oil in there and then they get a wick which is um you see a candle the the wick is is sort of the same sort of thing um I think there's a there's a texture they put on to stop it just burning all the way down but the idea is the the wick sits into the bowl just drapes in there and sort of squrs around into the bottom so that's in the oil and the oil gets soaked up the wick and it comes to the top and then they light the top of it and it's actually the oil that burns at the tip of the wick so that's your basic you know that made fancier ones because obviously you need to now protect the flame so the flame doesn't go out and and they get they get more more and more intense as as the um as people became smarter and decided what they wanted to do with these oils but that's the whole idea so you're burning the oil and that is your light so the the five wise and foolish had these lamps they had the flame going they had oil in their lamps because they were burning it um but the um but uh the lamp yeah so the lamp gives out light burning oil burning the Holy Spirit showing the life on display and you can even sing the little song that's a lot of mine I'm going to let it shine so that's they were all doing the right thing at the right time they were all virgins all perfectly honoring God and worshiping him so I keep looking at you guys cuz you're the biggest group don't don't everyone else is sort of spread out and hidden um so they're they're definitely putting their putting their life and putting their token on display they're letting they letting people know that um hey we are Christians we do worship God and that they're doing the right thing um but you see the difference is the wse took extra oil now to have oil separate that you aren't burning and isn't on display is something that you keep for yourself that is you and your walk with God that that is I'll jumped ahead that that is that but that is also rapturing Faith so there's a difference between what you're burning what you're showing what your token is on display and then there's your reservoir of this is my rapturing faith this is this is what I'm going to go to this is what I've got when I've shown and tried to talk to anyone I can try to sh share the message try to give out all that I have once that's run out I have rapturing faith and God will take me um so I've jumped ahead um so the bridegroom tered waiting um and that's Waiting for the End how how much longer Lord and all slept which I thought was quite interesting um and at midnight the call came the brim is here go out to meet him and that's that's the most exciting time as a Christian that's it we're going to the Rapture let's let's go um and the foolish did not have enough oil um and that's that's the moment of a little bit of a moment of Reckoning as in at this point I've given all I can but I don't have any inall why why have I not got any in store um and then they asked the wise they said hey can can you give us some can we can we pray through with you can we can we get in with you guys and unfortunately the wise said no because as good as they all are even the wise do not have spear to give and that's that's a very hard thing to to know um you can do all you can for anyone and everyone but at the end of the day you need to look after yourself and your walk with God it's um very important and they said no sorry we can't we've got enough for ourselves and our Rapture um if we if we give to you we we wouldn't have enough for ourselves um yeah so the foolish asked for the wise for the wises oil they could not give it to them even if they wanted to the bride elect did not have enough to spare did not have enough rapturing Faith no one has enough to spare your mom your dad it's an individual walk could even say your pastor anyone they do not have enough to spare for you it's your walk it's an individual walk um you and God you need to walk with god um I've got a quick um except from a William Brandon's sermon um these your five wise virgins who had oil in their lamps rapturing in faith believ in all the signs wonders prophecies and everything and these five cut out of the remnant was taken away the rest of them were still virgins and will not be lost but they will go through the tribulation period and Jesus said there there will be sort of trails off there and they said give us some of your oil we want the Holy Ghost now now anyone knows that the Holy Ghost in Zechariah 4 and oh James 5:14 all know that it represents oh he's he sort of skipped ahead um all know that it represents the Holy Ghost now he said that's the reason we anoint with oil representing the Holy Ghost now the oil of the spirit the Bible said now these had the Holy Ghost and were Sanctified these were Sanctified plus the Holy Ghost believe in all phenomenons and in everything of God's power everything God spoke of here they had it believ in it these were taken out and they said give to us now and they said we just got enough to get him with and they went away in the Rapture and it said go and buy from those who sell and they said they went to try to pray through then to receive the Holy Ghost but the Gentile dispensation had finished and the persecution Rose and he said they were cast into outer Darkness where there was weeping and wailing and there of teeth but in the second Resurrection there will be sheep that separate separated from the goats but never the bride never elect that's the remnant of the seed of the woman um so we've got how how to build Rapture in faith first of all faith is god-given um so what we can do is look to those who have been raptured so we have Enoch we have Elijah and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him amen walk with God that's how that's how you get rapturing Faith so how do you walk with God stay in his presence move as God moves have the one-on-one relationship with him yeah not God Pastor me god dad then me God propit me it's just God and you amen spend time in his word read your Bible pray it's great to have family time and Bible time but you need to pray and read your Bible yourself am um listen to God's word for for this day so William brandom sermons come to church as we do what you feed on will what you feed on you will be if you listen to things that will be if you listen to things if you listen to bad things you'll be grumpy and upset all the time listen to rock and roll that is a spirit of suicide on it movies and entertainment lustfulness what you feed on will affect you until you do the things that you don't want to do and believe things you wouldn't normally believe now we can't now we can't always see things but you can stop the second look yeah see you can't always stop seeing things but you can stop the second look and that's when you start um uh an ad comes on or a prompt in in the the YouTube I um quite a few years ago now um started getting quite a few YouTube prompts for watching some of the more political things and they they go quite hard against um certain certain um um presidents and and you can swing one way or the other and then they started going into some of the the movement at the moment which is into um The People's self identifying as whatever they want to be and you can sum it up quite quickly as fashion but hey that's what it is but you start getting wound out when they start talking about influencing younger people um and and what they teaching in schools and the likes and things like that and I was getting a little bit wound up because you know what you hear of what's going on in America and things like that it affects you and I found that I was getting grumpy I was getting grumpy I was getting upset I would not that I ever saw much of it here it was um as I say a few years ago but I caught myself I caught myself needlessly getting upset and I'm like what what am I what am I doing and it's what I was feeding on and I was so quick there was no sort of like little bit of little bit of here little bit of there then you start sort of scroll and of course the the YouTube algorithm is the more you look on it the more it feeds those little things and and of course it keeps you on one side because that you watch more of it if they show the full spectrum you start listening to both and and and you do and and I started getting wound up so what I fed on What affected me straight away so I stopped watching it by the way and yeah and know that obviously as you cuz I'm sort of thinking about myself and raising kids and and in that perspective obviously I want them to be growing up in God's word and God's word said man female and sorts it out so from that perspective I was like no no no I need to not get myself wound up about this give it back to God and carry it on with my walk with god um so that's that's that second look so you see one and it's a it's a clickbait it's it's interesting and and then you watch again and then the second look and then the look and then by that time you wrapped into it um what about in the physical more um um what about a half-dressed woman or man goes both ways um walking down the street you can't help seeing that's just normal the second look you can't help and that's when you start stopping what the devil's trying to throw in front of you and know it for what it is it's not the person it's the spirit on them you stop that second look cuz the second look becomes a third look becomes now you're interested and now you're actually trying to follow those types of people um yeah so stop the second look Man's eyes are attracted to movement that is a natural thing where are Hunters by by trade some of us are by trade um but we notice the movement and that's what we we follow but you can quickly see what's appropriate and what's not no need for the second look God has your wife or husband sorted for you and it's not some half-dressed person walking down the street stop the second look build rapturing Faith walk with god um stand on God's word and you'll be an anomaly in this world and always will be um just going back to our first reading so the first reading is in Matthew and you don't need to turn back to it I haven't actually references I do have a few more references but I haven't um I sort of want to keep keep the kids interested um so um going back to the first read of Jesus and his disciples on the Mount of Olives and it's a real place um Rachel's not here to sort of pointed out but she has been there oh and and K you've been there um it's a real place you can visit it if you want to but Jesus was there and he says to them you're all going to be offended because of of me tonight now that's that's a hard saying for anyone even if it's just a friend saying that to you it's hard for you not to instantly push against it and Peter being the the sort of quick to respond type of guy that he is said no I'll never I I'll never be ashamed of you and then Jesus responded you'll deny me three times yeah you me three times and yeah imagine that imagine you're there you followed this guy you've dropped everything and he did he dropped everything he was a fisherman his whole livelihood what he used to know he dropped the lot and he followed Jesus he' been through the pile that had left and it was just down to the 12 he still followed him and this night you'll deny me three times um the story carries on that um Jesus also talks to them and um says I'm just trying to paraphrase but says have you gotten any swords those that don't have swords you should sell your garments and go buy swords um and they said hey we've got two already and Jesus said that's enough and then Jesus went off to pray and they all fall asleep he comes back finds them and scolds them and says why are you falling asleep you couldn't wait for an hour you couldn't and um and then they're like oh okay and then he goes back off and prays again and he comes back and finds him asleep again and he leaves him now then before yeah so then Jesus comes back and then you've got this multitude of people coming at them and it's a multitude of um people with swords and it says staves so that's that's all your spars and sticks and things coming at them and then you've got Peter now Peter is he's a he's a reactor he's he was the first out of the boat he he's the one that jumps and that I've got this so you've got Peter he's been told you're going to deny me three times he's been asked do you have a sword yeah I got a sword um and actually says later um I think it's in John that it says that it's Peter that jumps up and then you got a multitude of people coming at you oh it's it's it's fight time let's go so he grabs the sword out goes out to defend Jesus and takes takes the first swing and either he wasn't very good or the guy dodged and he got his ear off got him um and then Jesus stops them now you want to be confused how about being wound up this is this is what's going to happen you're going to you're going to do this you know you're going to deny me you're you're going to going to pretend I'm not even here you're going to and then oh you got a sword yeah y yep and then and then a battle comes on at you that's it I'm in and then he stops you no this is not your fight so we need to know CU if you actually go back to where he Jesus was talking he talks to them and says tonight I'm I'm going to I'm going to be taken um paraphrasing again sorry but he wasn't listening he was all focused on self he was focused on no no no I've I've been told I'm going to deny him I'm not I'm never going to deny him even if they kill me right there's a whole bunch of people for me to fight against I'm in there's and it wasn't his fight um yeah oh oh it's fight time God warned me I have my sword let's go what happened Jesus stopped him it's not his fight the world coming to the end is not our fight that's what is forone for for told we knew he knew he should have known that it was that Jesus needed to be the sacrifice if he' listened we know that this Earth is is to come to an end it's not our fight we need to stay with God's true word then Jesus and then Jesus got LED away and now for Peter comes the test because it is a lot um so now comes a test Peter follows him and watches and it takes one maid someone who is against a guy back in those days who was strong a fisherman and had done he was he was about ready to take on a multitude of God guys with this one little sword took one little Maid to say hey aren't you the guy that walked with Jesus for him to go no no never been that that's n and another one no no surely you're the one with Jesus no no not that and it sort of shows it is sometimes actually most the time a lot easier to have something dead against you for you to fight you get a little niggle or a little oh no come on you can you can come along with us this will be fun oh yeah okay maybe oh just just just one little drink oh yeah oh no I don't drink oh you don't drink oh that's fine it's fine just come along just come along anyway just come to the party don't have to drink just just to just whereas if someone stood there and held something I'm using drink as an example everyone's got their own um um what what's the what's the word when something comes against you it's like a everyone has their own thing they struggle with or get packed by um so you know just just just one little just one little drink and it would have been easier to fight if someone was standing in front of you with a drink saying I want to force this down your throat for you to actually fight back and go H there you know that is easier than than someone little unassuming um physically not imposing or strong to just go oh just just take a little bit oh come on be cool join in and for for you to actually then start questioning what you stand on and if you're not in God's word you will partake that's that's the long and the short of it um yeah when it was guys with swords and a fight he he was in but a little bit of peer pressure and he folds now this is this is Peter he walked on water with Jesus he cast out demons with Jesus was ready to defend Jesus against the multitude and one maid saying you were with Jesus you're a Christian you pray to God for him to deny Christ um so don't don't underestimate peer pressure and he folds sometimes it's easier to have a defiant opposition to fight against than a little bit of peer pressure there's a um a sort of an easy scenario where is if you're standing there and say the devil PS in front of you and he's red as he is in the the little comics and he's got a pitchfork and a fork tail and he says oh you you're going to deny God for you to suddenly fight against but he doesn't come at you like that cuz he's he's smarter than that he knows how to get around things he knows how to just just drop those little bits of oh come on come do this oh here's a little ad just watch this oh here's a little bit of a a show here's a here's a bit of a whatever your fight is he he will he knows what it is and he'll just just niggle away at it until you start partaking and if you're not walking with God I'm sorry you will fail it's it's it's written through um yeah come come with us have a smoke have a drink you're not going to tell are you just relax I know you go to church just join in uh no need to pray no need to pray over your food at McDonald's this this was an interesting one for me so as as a kid I um Dad Dad would always pray and before you before you eat and it fine no no issues um I as a kid didn't really recognize um McDonald's as a restaurant it was just to grab food and carry on for me a restaurant was you go to a nice restaurant you sit down you pick the menu um and so I sitting in this in this restaurant and at McDonald's and dad goes to pray and all of a sudden and if you look at it sort of logically all of a sudden I'm more concerned about all these people in this restaurant that I'm I don't know I'm never going to see again probably I'm more concerned about what they think of me than actually praying to God it was an instant like hang on a minute and it wasn't until I got older that I sort of re-evaluated things like hang on where where do I stand what what actually is the show here it could be even for someone sitting in that um that that restaurant seeing someone else praying and being like Oh actually it's been a while since I've prayed and and that might have been all the kick they needed but in my little mind I was suddenly more conscious of people I didn't know it's and it's funny how someone you don't know affects your life and you shouldn't let it you should be walking with god um yeah peer pressure it's real and if you're not walking with God have the Holy Ghost rapturing Faith you will fail uh but don't worry Peter had enough of room experience and that changed him from head to toe now nothing could shake him nothing going on in the world nothing walk nothing walking by in front of him nothing distracting as a phone social media popular opinion fashion of the day what others would think he lived for God young people live for God your walk you read your Bible and you pray remember God deals with Israel as a nation and Gentiles as individuals your walk you and God I've got um one William Brandon quote but can I have the musicians up I think that's about my time um uh the next thing what's taken place there was lot this is just sort of reading through the the sermon um when God said separate yourself from everybody the walk with Christ is an individual walk you walk you stand alone with you and God Alone not you and the pastor you and God Alone not you and the Deacon sometimes you and your wife if you're married you and your husband but you and God alone you stand alone on your convictions salvation is not a church Affair it's an individual affair and that's that's all I've got for

your way in the rest of the service we thank you Lord in Jesus name amen thanks musicians uh let's just turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10 um can you bring up the the PowerPoint all right we'll just read this and then you can have your seats is that big enough oh it's really really small um okay um so the Bible says here for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so um I just want you to notice there one thing the law has a shadow and but the shadow is not the very image of the things to come and then if we can just drop down to um uh uh down to verse 19 um we won't read all of it we'll just read that first verse having therefore Breen boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of Jesus Amen you can have your seats so uh I just want to say two things brother Ben if I say anything not quite right you can correct me afterwards and and just tell everyone okay that wasn't right um and then the other thing is um I think for any minister or any person standing here and preaching because you're preaching the word of God you're preaching it to yourself so you know the things that you preach is it doesn't mean that you don't struggle or you've got it down pat for lack of better words um it applies to you just as much as as as the congregation so um all right I hope this works but um but B mentioned a few things um in this morning service which I'm glad about because it means that we're in the same I'm on the right channel if you like so I hope this was going to work but I don't know if it will but I have a shadow right everyone has a shadow so uh I should have grabbed a torch or something but if I hold my hand here if you see that shadow can you see right now what's making that shadow no you can't but the closer I come to it okay it's a little bit more clearer okay we can see it's a long Shadow but we still don't know what it is if I'm about there you can probably make out okay these fingers okay that's a hand but when my hand gets here you see oh okay it's a hand it's a hand what we're looking at so the law is a shadow and it was showing something coming so um so all the uh stories and things we read in the Old Testament um had foreshadowed something had showed something um it talked about something that was coming um and yeah so so so a lot of things in the Bible is like brother bam says you've got to read between the lines um it means something it means something that's that that was going to come and it's painting a picture so all right so yeah so all these old stories and things in the Bible it all pointed to Calvary and God's Redemption plan on Earth um brother Ben preached about the Redemption plan this morning so it's it's it's it's painting a picture and it'll probably become more clearer as we carry on so can we put up the next slide please yep that's the one so this is a picture of um Abraham and Isaac probably after Isaac was going to be offered but what I just want to show was just a sacrifice so um so obviously uh the Old Testament Believers had to perform sacrifices and all these things under the law um and and that was a picture of Christ coming and dying on the cross so all these things that happened was a shadow but it wasn't the hand yet the hand was Jesus coming and dying on the cross our sins the perfect lamb so um so it's not just that there many things that happen so also uh so we know natural Israel is a type of spiritual Israel which is us which is which is the believer so and the things which Israel went through in the Old Testament reflects what we go through what the church goes through and also the the individual the believer goes through so so brother brandom says so we're going to talk about Abraham for a bit so brother Bram says the beginning of Christianity the beginning of the church was with Abraham so um okay we're going to have like a little bit of a history lesson and uh if you can put on the Le next slide please Talia so uh I hope that's visible but I thought it would be nice to just visualize it so I don't know if this picture is correct it's the only one I could find and it it it lines up with what the Bible says so uh so if brother baham says Christianity started with the beginning of the church was with Abraham so the life of Abraham and his Descendants the children of Israel um is painting a painted a picture and we'll we'll we'll see as we carry on so um I'm just going to read these scriptures but um Talia if you could be on the trigger I would appreciate it and if you could just put up this actually no keep the map on there keep the map on there um the Lord came to Abraham so this is the first time in the Bible that God appeared to Abraham and um and the Bible says now the Lord had said to Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land which I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy am great and thou shall be a blessing and I will bless them that bless them and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed okay I'll backtrack slightly so before this Abraham lived with his father and er of the chales which is up here up here um you guys probably recognize that is um modern day Israel is roughly there and that was canaan's land back then so so Abraham's father and Abraham and Sarah and family members traveled up to that place called haran right at the top I don't know when he came in but I can't see it speaking about it on the Bible but there Abraham's father died and this is when the Lord appeared to Abraham and said and said um get thee out of thy country and from th Kindred and from th Father's House unto a land which I will show thee and that was canaan's land down there so uh so at this point Abraham was 5 years old so when he was 75 he departed from haran and went down to shikim which is somewhere I don't know where all these stops on the way what what they meant to mean but this is just the picture I got off the internet so so Abraham went there but the Lord said to Abraham get thee out of th country and from th Kindred and from their father's house but brother bam says he did exactly what the Lord told him not to do and he took lot his nephew with him okay so so so as Abraham's life is carrying on oh I wanted to put a picture up there of um them living in tense because that's what they lived in back then was tense in that desert country so um so Abraham continued down and the Bible talks about him going down into Egypt because there was a famine up there and then he went South of Egypt and then he came back to the land that God initially called him to and uh and then in Genesis 13 the Lord comes to Abraham again actually sorry in between okay so the next thing that happened was um was the argument that um Abraham's her men had with lots her men they separated so lot went to Sodom and Abraham stayed we in canaan's land and then the Bible says and the Lord said to Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward so Abraham's in the land looking northward Southward Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee so that was one of the first instances instances where the Lord promised that land to the Seed of Abraham all right so so so uh this was after lot separated Abraham separated from lot so finally Abraham was in the place where the Lord wanted him from the beginning and then he came and reminded him of his promise so bear in mind God is promising all these things to Abraham but his wife can't have children he doesn't have any children so how is this going to be your seed he said to Abraham so I just want to just make a point on um on how lot had to separate abraam had to be separated from lot before the Lord um continued as as plan um in Abraham's life so uh we just the next um slide we'll just read a quote of brother brandham so brother Bram says sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has called you to I'm sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in Christ to where God has called you but what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price is um our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God had to die for us see things of value come at great price next slide to bring this message it wasn't easy see no it isn't I had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but see the value of it is you see is to do the will of God and to do that which knowing that there's something in me when they used to say well they was going to put me away thought I lost my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the church and all these things they said he's crazy but you see no matter what they said there's nothing there there is something has to be done and God just takes a person sticks him in his hand and say do this and you do it so um yeah so the same way for for abraam you know the Lord for his will to um he he he he he's moving in your life for you to walk in his will for your life all right so so back to Abraham can we just go back to that map again just I'll just keep it up there um in between the other slides actually I can control it from here can't I I think um sorry excuse me but Ben if I go over time just give me a nod and I'll cut it off and okay uh all right uh yeah so back to Abraham a few things happened and then for example um lot was taken captive by those kings and Abraham went and got them back um and like the king of Salem met him and and then again in Genesis 15 the Lord comes again to Abraham and and the Lord says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and the exceeding great reward so see God is keep keeping on promising this to Abraham but Abraham is probably thinking well sarra kind have any children how is this going to happen and then uh the Bible says and Abraham said Lord God what Willl thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Ali ASA of Damascus and Abraham said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir so Lord how are you going to fulfill this is this guy this servant in my house is he going to be my Heir is he going to is are you going to fill the promise through him um and then the Lord repeats his promises to Abraham I'm not going to read it it's quite a it's a long bit um but the Bible says and he believed the Lord and accounted it to him for righteousness so Abraham believed what the Lord said to him and then okay okay so this is the next interesting bit so so he said okay Lord your promis is to me but how by what will I know that you made this promise promise that I that I that I will inherit this land my seed will inherit this land and then um I'm going to read the verse in the Bible listen to it and then we'll I guess sort of unpack it um once I've read it um and he said unto him and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me an hepher of three years old and a sheo goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against the other but the birds he divided not and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abraham drove them away can we just put that up as I'm reading please um thank you and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham so this is the response God gave to Abraham when he said how um should will I know you make this Covenant with me and when the sun was going down a deep SE sleep fell upon Abraham and low a horror of great Darkness fell upon him sorry that is um Genesis 15:3 and he said unto Abraham know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger and the land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they serve I will judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance so here God already foretold that the children of Israel Abram seed was going to be in Egypt and become slaves and the Lord was going to bring them out and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shall be buried a good age and so on and so forth and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark so remember okay so um and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between the pieces so the carcasses that Abraham split of the animals in the same day the Lord made a commant covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt under the Great River the river Euphrates the land of the kenites the Kites and all those different names um right may I use one of you young guys for an example um for an example just to help me make an example all right all right so okay so here what we saw was God was making a covenant with Abraham um he promised him his seed will possess the land of his enemies Gates of his enemies and um and and he was making a covenant so in our day let's say you're a builder and I want a house to be built and B you can correct me this is wrong um so I'm going to pay you a certain amount of money and you're going to build me this house but we need to write up a contract so that none of us can pull out of the uh pull out of this agreement so we're write up a contract and that's legally binding and maybe we'll say okay yes um we we have a deal okay that that's today but back in um that day uh um what they used to do was they used to take an animal and cut it in half split it like we cut a deer up on the weekend so you guys would have a fresh picture of your mind what a animal taken apart looks like so and then they would put the animal split on the ground and then me and you would stand in between the animal and we would write on a piece of paper our contract yeah so probably not um that probably uh building a house probably is a little bit too serious for this but if it was a really serious Covenant okay so we wrote it on the paper we ripped the paper in half I gave you half and I have half so those two papers come back together so that's the Covenant no no one else can come and say uh no it was a different Covenant because you've got a half and I've got a half okay and then that's our agreement okay right thank you Mo um so that's how they did it back then so what was the Lord doing to Abraham there can you connect the dots he was making a covenant with Abraham with the with the animals that Abraham cut in half and the Bible says and it came to pass when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces that passed between those pieces of animal so God was making a covenant he was he was confirming or making a covenant with Abraham that his seed will possess the land of Canan and will possess the gates of his enemies all right this is probably very basic but we we'll go through it anyway probably it's nothing new but all right all right I'll just read this quote um brother bam sees uh God told Abraham I have blessed you and I've made you a father not I will I have I have made you and you'll come to me in an old age you're going to be saved and I've already done it I've already said so you haven't got nothing to do with it it's unconditional God God determined to have his church so every time he made a covenant with man man breaks his Covenant and he does yet today man will always break his Covenant with God but God can't break his Covenant with man so I will so brother bam says that Covenant that God made with Abraham was unconditional so it wasn't it didn't depend on how good Abraham was he was a human being like me and you with sinful incl inclinations and faults and problems but the Lord said it doesn't matter who you are what you are I'm making this Covenant with you um so we we all know about the garden of Eden um the Covenant Covenant that God made with the Covenant that was there between God and Adam and Eve it said if you obey my word if you do this if you do that you will not die but if you don't you will die so this Covenant was sure it was it was because this was the whole picture of the Plan of Redemption God said it is so it's not if there's no questions about it so and I pray that the Lord makes that real to each one of us so um so once again so all these things that happened to Abraham in the natural means something in the spiritual it was showing something that was um was to come so we are not the may not necessarily be the physical descendants of Abraham but because this is a type of the spiritual Abraham believed God's promise and This Promise applies to the believer um we're going to get into it as we go on I'm probably running ahead of myself a bit but if we have faith in the promise of God we are Abraham's seed spiritually this is what the picture is showing so yeah and and the land that um the land that Abraham's seed was to possess um as a type of God's promises to the believer everything from salvation to if if we have a need healing every promise in the book is ours and and um and yeah the way I I I understand this is that the that promised land and also going to heaven is also part of our Promised Land um it's it's our inheritance so that's what canaan's land this place spiritually means for the believer um all of our promises it's our land but we have to fight for it as Abraham may not have known it but his seed would have had to fight to possess those promises it wasn't given to them on a platter um even though I mean salvation is as simple as believing it because it's yours Lord's done it you don't have to do do anything um but there's maybe battles in our life that we face that uh you know just walk through it and uh slay the giant slay the next one easy peasy you're probably going to fight and there's going to be blood sweet and tears but um but the Lord but the thing is do you believe that the Lord has given it to you he said it's yours and and as I said I'm preaching to myself here because sometimes our minds make yeah we probably over think things but um all right I I won't get off track we'll just keep going all right yeah just to um okay we put Romans four up there please um verse 13 I'm trying to go a bit fast because I've got a lot to go through but uh uh uh yeah so just just bear with me all right so that verse says for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith and if you drop down to verse 16 it says therefore is is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law like natural Abraham seed but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all so in the natural that picture of Abraham seed is painting a picture but what it's actually painting is in the spiritual do you believe God's promise and if you are if you do you are Abraham's seed and uh we'll just go back to our opening verse Hebrew 10 I'll I'll just rip it I'll put it up on here I've got it um so if we read that again it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the cers there unto perfect so all that Old Testament law all the sacrifices and things could not make us perfect because they were not the very image which is Jesus Christ coming and um and yeah completely obliterating sin and his life the Holy Spirit the brothers both brothers mentioned the the Holy Spirit and and being sealed you know the life of Jesus coming back on the believer that was the very image that was the hand that we talked about not the shadow so brother Ram says now as I expressed a few moments ago about reading between the lines but if you're reading between the lines and trying to make it say something that in between the lines says something different than what the line says then it's wrong but it's got to agree all the way through it the Bible is just like a great jigs or puzzle if you'll excuse the expression and if you just try to put it together just the way you look at it you've got to have something over here to look at if you don't you'll ruin your scene you'll have a cow picking grass on top of a tree Uh something's not quite right there uh so you know the Bible says lead not to your own understanding we should um yeah we should pray that the Lord reveals it to us otherwise yeah we might not get the picture so that's the way it is when you try to put the Bible together with a intellectual understanding of it you can't do it it's a spirit written word and it takes the Holy Spirit to place it together then you get the whole great picture from Eden out into chaos so what he's saying is from Eden I believe this is what he's saying from Eden all the way to the end of the world Satan and his imps going into chaos um so then you get that whole picture great picture from Eden out into chaos and the way of the Cross back home that's the entire picture God God's Redemption storying of story of sending his own son to redeem a lost and polluted people so once again all these Old Testament stories and things pointing to the great Redemption plan um of God sending his own son to redeem a lost and polluted people right so let's keep looking at uh Abraham I just put that picture up just something nice to look at um we'll just keep um on with Abraham and a seed and what happened to them in the natural so a certain amount of time after the Lord made the promise to Abraham that his seed will um all these promises to Abraham Sarah got impatient or maybe she didn't believe it at that time she did believe it in the end because the Bible says um Sarah judged them faithful who had promised um and so she she did she did believe in the end but at this time she said well Abraham I'll give you my maid servant Hagar maybe the Lord uh wanted uh you to have a son through her and then she'll give the son to me and I'll raise the son and thereby fulfill God's promise but that's not what the Lord said so yeah so s jum ahead of the promise of God by doing that um but it it didn't work so um but yeah so uh I guess I guess that's the same of us like we can do that sometimes but I'm thankful that in the end you know in the book of Hebrews it said through faith Sarah did this and through faith Abraham and through faith all the Believers it doesn't say anything about her doubting so in the end what actually mattered was Sarah believed so the Lord brought her through and same with us he'll um yeah he'll he'll bring us through those questions and things in our minds so um for lack of B words uh okay um all right so in Genesis 17 sometime later the Lord came to Abraham again this was very close to the time when Isaac was actually born and he said to Abraham the Bible says and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect so this is quite amazing you know the Lord said to Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect and he requires me and you to walk before him and be perfect but not through our own effort because we cannot walk before him and be perfect and um you know the Bible says that our righteousness is as filthy rags so all of our efforts and trying are as filthy rags even though the believe the Lord sees the intents of our heart um but he sent a perfect sacrifice a perfect lamb Jesus Christ and if we have accepted that sacrifice then God doesn't see us he looks through his blood and he sees us perfect and sinless and Genesis 18 um it says and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do actually if you can put that up please Genesis 18 verse1 17 and the Lord said to Abraham uh and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him so for the Lord to be able to bring that Covenant to pass in Abraham's life Abraham had to walk in the Lord's way and believe the promise um what if Abraham turned his back on God and walked away I don't I I can't see the Promise being fulfilled if he said no Lord I walk away I don't believe you but the Lord because he knew because Abraham was a son and daughter of God the Lord knew he would not do that so just the same way because the Lord knows his sons and daughters will keep his way um um he he knows that his sons and daughters will keep his way so that his promise can be fulfilled in their lives um even though it's actually him keeping us and not us holding on to him um I'll just find my place here quickly all right so there's a few times after this where um the Lord speaks to Abraham again and reminds him of his promise and says um just repeats it to him um and at one point Abraham actually said to God um oh that Ishmael might love before thee Lord is Ishmael the one you're going to bring this promise to pass through and then the Lord came to him and said no Sarah thy wife shall be the bear the a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beg get and I will make him a great nation but my Covenant I will establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year so um yeah we all know the story of um King aimc wanting Sarah for wife and and then Abraham lying lying and saying she's my sister and how the Lord visited Abraham before going to Sodom and Sarah laugh in the tent when the Lord reminded Abraham of his promise but then the time came where the Lord fulfilled his promise so I love this verse um Genesis 21:1 says we'll put it up there please Talia um and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken so 25 years after he made that first promise the promised son came and and and Isaac was born and it still didn't fulfill everything um Isaac still have to get children get many children many na uh um and the 12 tribes of Israel so Israel is obviously the descendants of Abraham all right um I've got way too much here I'm just going to I'm just going to cut down a bit so if we fast forward all this um it came a point where um uh we all know the story of Joseph and how they ended up in um in Egypt um and and how they multiplied and the Egyptians started oppressing them and uh and before Moses came on the SE and the Lord took them out of Egypt so I just want to drop something in here I don't know how many of you guys knew that Joseph was a type once again a type or a shadow um of Jesus because if you look at Joseph's life it parallels very nice with the life of Jesus so Joseph was loved by his father but hated by his Brethren and so was Jesus um you know when the the spirit of God ascended on him like a dove and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased um but the Jews hated him because he was a prophet and a spiritual person and they called him beab um his Brethren the Jews hated him and when Joseph was cast into prison after P's wife falsely accused him um and he went down uh into prison and met the Butler and the baker um uh Joseph had the Butler and the baker I think had the dreams and Joseph interpreted them and one of them was uh um was basically put to death by pharaoh and the other one was um forgiven or proven to be not guilty and he was um brought back into service to pharoh he was um just the same as that um on the cross when Jesus died the one Thief did not um revile Jesus and and and he went to hell and the other Thief was forgiven he asked for mercy so there's that type and once Joseph came out of prison he was exalted to the right hand of um pharaoh and after Jesus was crucified and rose again he was exalted to the right hand of God um and Joseph took a a gentile bride do you guys know what Gentile means I'm sure you do it means not a Jew so in the Bible there's essentially the Bible talks about three people so Jews Gentiles which are not Jews and Samaritans which are half Jew or part Jew and part Gentile so so Joseph actually married a he married um I'm not sure if it was pharoh's daughter but um he married an Egyptian a gentile and Jesus Christ took a gentile bride we are Gentiles um yeah so so the life of Joseph was another um type in the Old Testament pointing to Calvary and Jesus coming to Earth and and his great Redemption plan so yeah so after all this um when they multiplied in Egypt and a pharaoh um raised up which didn't know Joseph they started oppressing the Israelites and um and and then Moses came on the scene all right oh but God had already told Abraham that this was going to happen so yeah excuse me if this is Bland but it's it's probably just a history lesson like it's nice to see from the start how the Lord called Abraham how everything happened and yeah and the picture it paints right so so we know the Lord made the promise to Abraham Abraham was long off the scene by now and then the Lord brought Moses into the picture to fulfill that promise so the Bible says and when the Lord saw that he turned aside this is now the burning bush um that um the Lord spoke to Moses out of when the Lord saw that he turned aside to seea God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a land a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and all the other ites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mightest bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt so to me uh the children of Israel being in Egypt is a type of us being some of us came out of the world some of us were raised in a Christian family but we still had to come to a point where we came we come out of um we still have to come to a point where we accept Jesus Christ as our savior and make a decision and come out of our Egypt so so to speak and and once they came out of Egypt um they were on their Journey to the promised land and um and you know the Bible talks about the task Masters and the Egyptians being hard on the Israelites uh but though that was because you know the time was coming for the Lord to deliver them of those Egyptians and I believe that sometimes the Lord allows troubles in our lives um and things to become Grievous because it's time for us to be delivered from those things and he wants but but for him to be able to move and deliver you you need to be at a place of desperation where you say Lord I don't want this anymore so he can deliver you from it um if we're happy to live with them but don't want to be delivered you won't be delivered you've got to want it all right we won't be long we'll be just another 15 minutes I think so brother bam says now they've had many exoduses of course but I'm speaking on the time that God called in Exodus a separation from where they were at the present time here God is making ready to fulfill his Divine promised word that he had give to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob years hundreds of years had passed but yet God never forgets his promise in the season the due time God always makes his promise right therefore you can rest assured that what God has promised in this Bible he's going to do it just kn need of trying to think anything else and say well the prophet was maybe was wrong or that couldn't happen in this day looked almost impossible then more impossible than it does now but God did it anyhow because he promised he would do it amen so yeah so it make take many years for things to happen but if God said it is going to happen all right so we all know how the children of Israel traveled through the Wilderness after Egypt and many things happened and they came to Kadesh Bania just before the promised land and um and they sent in 12 Spies and 10 of them came back and said no we can't do it we're not able um and Joshua and Caleb said no we are able because the Lord said we're able um but because of that so because of of of the majority of them saying no we can't do it they had to go another 40 years in the wilderness and all those people that said we can't do it died in the wilderness so you can see how God hated it when they said we can't do it because he said I've I've given it to you I will do it um so um in Joshua verse one it says Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children children of Israel so remember how we said all these things paints a picture and it all mean something so that Covenant that God made with Abraham also types A Spiritual Covenant God made with his church and every believer and as we said um the promised land is a type of all the promises God made to his to to the believer in his word um and that Promised Land there's eternal life there's healing there's overcoming there's forgiveness every Redemptive blessing written in the Bible is in that Promised Land but we've got to fight to possess it so to carry on Joshua uh the Bible says Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place at the sole of your foot shall sh upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man be there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life speaking to Joshua as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them amen so um the brothers talked this morning about the Holy Spirit and being born again so what gives us the right to possess all these promises in our land um the Holy Spirit brother Braham says the holy spirit is the token um the token that we um that gives us a right to all all these promises he says now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God gives you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and every Theologian will have to admit that to be yes sir is the new birth you're born and new of the Holy Ghost and because that God has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit and everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours it's your property it's your property because it's paid for amen life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid for it he has paid the price everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds the token so we can see how important it is to have the Holy Spirit and I believe that if you don't have it or you're not sure if you open your heart the Lord will give it it's like um it's like brother Brandon mentions about that 100 foot pipe in the sky imagine a massive long pipe with water in it like hundreds of hundreds of meters in the sky um the pressure at the bottom that water trying to come out that's like the pressure of God the Holy Spirit over every life if you open up to him he will rush into you brother B says and then if you are Christians you have a right a legal right for everything that Christ died for it's your possession you own it it's yours now the only thing that you can is to do like Abraham after he had endured a fight he obtained the promise Satan just don't let you take it easy you've got to have faith you've got to believe it you've got to God told those Moses said that land belongs to you and yet it was all fenced up with Philistines and everything else he said it's yours I have give it to you now go take it Divine Healing is to every one of you it belongs to you now can you go take it go take it this morning and um and another sermon he says like it is today many have looked for these things and yet they don't recognize them they don't realize the way out they still trying to seek pleasures and things of the world trying to find their way out there was been many signposts that pointed to that day many great foreshadows it had been foreshadowed by the Lamb by the bulock by the turtle dove and all of these things but yet could not break it um it could not break that death hold where Satan had the Earth and I want you to notice where it says there um what at 50 paragraph 59 there was there's been many sign posts that pointed to that day and that day is Calvary so it all points to Calvary and the Plan of Redemption and what God is doing in this day and the spiritual battle we find ourselves in as Believers to take our promised land and even though it's hard I mean we all can say it's hard the Lord said it is yours I've given it to you so I pray that the Lord helps us to be able to take him at his word and and possess our land and by his grace we will yeah so um yeah forgive me if this was very chopped up but I I hope at least um uh we can see the picture um that throughout the lives of all those Old Testament Believers Abraham Moses David Ruth and Boaz it's all painting something to come um like Hebrews 10 said I'll pull that up again for the law having a shadow of good things to come um yeah so all the lives of those Believers painted a picture and today we are walking out in it um yeah so I'll just finish with this one quote um and then I'm off the hook uh yeah I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with him yeah I don't feel I'm there yet I don't know if you're there yet but I believe if yeah if the prophet said it um we can have that and I believe we will have that so yeah amen can uh we just have the musicians and brother Ben can you come up [Applause] please can we sing Father Abraham but I don't want to lead it okay we don't have to okay amen praise the Lord as we heard fish saying you got to have a personal walk with God I like the the hidden reservoir of oil there it's a SE rapturing faith is a secret between you and God I mean the world don't know about it but you know it amen praise the Lord now I was thinking about the um Covenant brother M come here again sorry come here so you know you know how the Devil comes to you and tells you you're not an over come you can't have Victory you're never going to get out of this you're not really a Christian right so God he took the coven right who this is that's your heart right then the Devil comes along and tries to tell you what is part of your Covenant right so he tries to tell you you can't win you're never going to out this you never going to be free you're not really a Christian you have rapturing faith what you need to do is look at your and try and match it with what he's telling you and you'll find out what he's trying to tell you doesn't match what God's given you right amen thank you for that amen so I think we should just we should take everything the devil tells us back to the Covenant God has given us we say hey this ain't matching this ain't matching this is not the agreement that God's given me so you can shut up and go away amen praise the Lord but praise the Lord for Abraham's Journey it's our journey as well amen praise God so let's stand up don't do that to me I'm s yeah okay let's do it let's do it I bear no
