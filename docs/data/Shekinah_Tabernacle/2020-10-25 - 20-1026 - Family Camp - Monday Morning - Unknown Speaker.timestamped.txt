[37:30] [Applause]
[37:31] [Music]
[37:31] [Applause]
[37:34] is
[37:37] [Music]
[38:40] i just want to say a little bit about
[38:42] the song before i sing it because i
[38:43] actually wrote the song about a year ago
[38:46] and i've never
[38:47] sung it before just so it's never worked
[38:50] out and i just believe that
[38:51] it was for this time and just going in
[38:54] line with what
[38:55] has been preached and the burden for the
[38:57] song
[38:58] come for the youth after hearing
[39:01] questions like well i don't
[39:03] really know if there is a god or i don't
[39:04] understand god
[39:06] and it's just a real burden that came
[39:07] upon my heart to write the song
[39:10] you know and jesus came to set the
[39:13] captives free and there can be
[39:15] small things in your life children who
[39:17] you know what a captive
[39:18] is right a cat that's a prisoner and
[39:21] things can change you that are maybe
[39:23] just
[39:23] small things but jesus can set you free
[39:26] of that thing
[39:27] you know and god is real we see him in
[39:30] the resurrection you know we see the
[39:32] we see a seed goes down into the ground
[39:34] and it comes back again
[39:35] and you say well i don't know if god can
[39:37] heal me but yet you see a branch on a
[39:38] tree
[39:39] and the wind blows and that branch
[39:42] breaks and it's hanging down but it
[39:43] doesn't just die
[39:44] and fall off that branch heals itself
[39:48] and it and it grows with that sap around
[39:49] it and now that heel of that wound
[39:51] becomes
[39:52] stronger than it was before and you try
[39:54] to break that branch again it'll break
[39:56] somewhere else because you get stronger
[39:59] jesus came to set the captives free
[40:12] but it seems like everything's a mystery
[40:17] dark clouds build around you and your
[40:20] questioning
[40:21] remember god is revealed in simplicity
[40:27] just walk with him and you will see
[40:31] that jesus came to set the captives free
[40:36] my chains are loosed i now
[40:39] walk free he walks with me
[40:42] i have the victory jesus came and said
[40:48] is captive free so don't be
[40:51] down cause you had the victory
[40:55] christ is here living in you
[40:58] and me if you wanna see his power
[41:02] then stay around me the same things he
[41:05] did i
[41:06] am manifesting cause jesus came to
[41:10] said the cat is free
[41:13] my chains are loosed i now walk free
[41:18] he walks with me i have the victory
[41:23] jesus came and said this cat they're
[41:26] free
[41:27] so don't be weary with your face to the
[41:31] ground
[41:32] jesus is risen and he's here with us now
[41:37] so lift your eyes and you will
[41:40] see jesus christ is setting his bride

[42:20] price

[44:07] this game as well as the word
[44:10] like for me the lord has spoken to me
[44:16] and how many people here were going one
[44:19] way
[44:20] then something supernatural happened and
[44:23] never going a different way
[44:25] amen that's my testimony brother
[44:29] that is my testimony i spend a lot of my
[44:33] time
[44:34] in the past looking at the past looking
[44:37] behind me there's no victory in that
[44:40] brothers and sisters
[44:41] no victory in that at all
[44:45] now to all intents and purposes
[44:48] you see a christian standing here and i
[44:50] appreciate what the lord's done for me
[44:53] if you want to know what sort of
[44:54] christian i'm like you ask my wife and
[44:56] you ask my children
[44:58] and i can stand here and tell you now i
[45:01] haven't always been a good man
[45:06] i believe the lord's changed that i
[45:08] believe the lord's done a work in my
[45:09] life
[45:12] and there's so many people here that
[45:13] have helped with this camp
[45:15] there's so many people here i'd love to
[45:16] thank on an individual basis
[45:18] so many people i'd love to say goodbye
[45:20] to we have to leave at 12 to catch the
[45:21] ferry i won't be able to do that
[45:23] but there's one person here who's
[45:26] especially
[45:26] made the effort to serve
[45:30] and to play the piano in church
[45:33] and it's my darling wife who i adore
[45:37] and love so much
[45:40] she's my queen
[45:45] and i'm going to stand here and say that
[45:49] she's now my priority in my life

[45:57] little wee bit

[46:29] [Music]
[46:38] ladies and gentlemen
[46:41] may i have your attention
[46:46] i want to introduce to
[46:49] you
[46:51] [Music]
[46:53] in this corner
[46:57] of the good and the right
[47:02] stands a champion
[47:04] [Music]
[47:08] his height exceeds the heavens
[47:12] his weed outweighs the world
[47:15] his reach reaches everywhere
[47:19] his age is ever
[47:22] more he
[47:26] is higher than the highest
[47:29] and greater than the great
[47:34] no one will take his crown away
[47:40] he's more mighty than the mightiest
[47:44] he reigns from above
[47:52] he's the old time undisputed
[47:57] undefeated champion of
[48:00] love
[48:03] he left his hometown
[48:07] to enter this arena
[48:11] he raised his hands in victory
[48:15] for me an angry crowd shouted crucifying
[48:21] the king who wore their crown
[48:24] and they gladly watched their champion
[48:27] going down
[48:31] but i will never count him out
[48:35] cause i'm a witness of
[48:38] the day rose to retain the title
[48:42] champion of love
[48:48] he is higher than the highest
[48:53] and greater than the grave
[48:57] no one will take his crown
[49:00] away he's more

[1:23:21] that is just some circumstances that
[1:23:23] you've been blessed
[1:23:24] everything that you are going through
[1:23:26] right now has been ordained by god

[1:23:29] he said that every trial that you go
[1:23:31] through has been ordained before the
[1:23:33] foundation
[1:23:34] of the world is that right praise the
[1:23:36] lord so let's just bow our heads and
[1:23:37] we'll just
[1:23:38] start with the word of prayer thank you

[1:23:49] and lord i'm just a man that lord has
[1:23:51] his weaknesses which is
[1:23:53] too long to list lord god but i pray
[1:23:56] that the
[1:23:57] mighty god lord who ordained everybody
[1:24:00] here to be in this day would come on the
[1:24:03] scene lord god and that you would take
[1:24:05] over the speaker
[1:24:06] that your lord bring your anointing to
[1:24:08] the word to bring the dynamics of the
[1:24:10] scriptures lord into plain view
[1:24:13] lord god we are so needful of you lord
[1:24:16] we
[1:24:16] are a needful people lord we are the
[1:24:18] woman who is needing the headship of the
[1:24:20] man
[1:24:21] and lord we are breaking all the laws
[1:24:23] though that is in layer deceive because
[1:24:25] lord we are coming back into the way
[1:24:27] that you
[1:24:28] saw us before the foundation of the
[1:24:30] world lord god a
[1:24:31] husband and a wife heading back to eden

[1:25:07] thank you musicians really appreciate
[1:25:09] you and i want to say to
[1:25:11] the wellington fellowship how much
[1:25:15] we really enjoyed the hospitality that
[1:25:18] was shown here
[1:25:19] brother ben
[1:25:24] brother ben we appreciate you and your
[1:25:26] wife and all of the brethren
[1:25:29] of the hospitality was absolutely
[1:25:31] astounding you know it's just something
[1:25:34] that is
[1:25:34] it's an eternal thing going on you know
[1:25:37] and we have to be
[1:25:38] aware that we're dealing with eternal
[1:25:40] beings and so when we come along here
[1:25:43] we're not just uh looking at brothers
[1:25:45] and sisters and
[1:25:46] we we are eternal beings and we need to
[1:25:48] come and to have a clear understanding
[1:25:51] of that
[1:25:52] eternalness that's in every one of us
[1:25:54] because you know we look at our bodies
[1:25:56] we see some
[1:25:57] all different ages of people but you
[1:25:59] know the prophet of god said that in
[1:26:00] that soul we are as
[1:26:02] eternal as what god is eternal and that
[1:26:05] is
[1:26:05] that is heavy stuff isn't it we are as
[1:26:08] eternal as what god is eternal because
[1:26:10] we came from
[1:26:11] god but we had to be put in this time
[1:26:13] dimension
[1:26:14] this realm that's just falling apart but
[1:26:16] god purposed
[1:26:17] us to be here so that that character
[1:26:20] building can come into expression
[1:26:22] is that right because you need to have
[1:26:24] an opposing force
[1:26:26] so let's not come let's not complain
[1:26:28] about the opposing forces
[1:26:30] we say thank you for the opposing forces
[1:26:32] lord because it's making me what you
[1:26:34] have ordained me to be
[1:26:36] is that right praise the lord so uh
[1:26:39] thank you church
[1:26:41] and it's just wonderful to see um
[1:26:44] a representation from around the nation
[1:26:47] you know brother freddie and the brother
[1:26:49] ferdi paid me a compliment last night
[1:26:51] they said brother adrian you have
[1:26:52] changed
[1:26:56] that's shrinking in there they're
[1:26:57] shrinking down over there says oh you've
[1:26:59] really mellowed man
[1:27:00] and i took that as a real compliment you
[1:27:02] know because you know we've all gone
[1:27:04] through we've all got our histories and
[1:27:06] and uh complexes from over the years all
[1:27:09] the
[1:27:10] the when the trumpet sounds it causes a
[1:27:12] spiritual war we go into warfare we've
[1:27:14] got
[1:27:14] scars but you know this this
[1:27:18] is your time now amen you young people
[1:27:21] that's raising up this is your time
[1:27:24] and uh when we go out of here face the
[1:27:27] enemy knowing
[1:27:28] it's your time to hold the sword some of
[1:27:31] us have been holding the sword for years
[1:27:32] and years and years and got worn down
[1:27:34] but we're still holding the sword
[1:27:36] but now it's your time to come and stand
[1:27:38] up take the sword
[1:27:40] and cut through all those 200 million
[1:27:42] demons
[1:27:43] that have been loosed against the bride
[1:27:45] is that right
[1:27:46] that i've been loosed against you but
[1:27:49] i've got some sad news for them
[1:27:52] i look at the end of the bible and the
[1:27:54] last word is oh
[1:27:55] amen and that means so be it
[1:28:00] and that a mean means he's finished
[1:28:04] so look at the end of the book and
[1:28:07] what's the book of revelation the book
[1:28:08] of the
[1:28:09] unveiling of all things the bible has
[1:28:12] been unveiled
[1:28:12] and you have been unveiled god's been
[1:28:15] unveiled you've been
[1:28:16] unveiled the book's unveiled
[1:28:18] everything's unveiled so now we can see
[1:28:21] everything clearly praise the lord
[1:28:24] let's just uh turn to if i got this
[1:28:28] little machine down here we'll stick up
[1:28:30] something up here
[1:28:33] let's just have to turn this on
[1:28:38] we're going to turn to the book of
[1:28:40] revelation
[1:28:43] now we want to look at what god has been
[1:28:46] awakening
[1:28:47] in us you know it says in jeremiah
[1:28:49] chapter 29 verse 10 we don't have to
[1:28:51] read it he says for thus saith the lord
[1:28:53] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:28:55] babylon i will visit you
[1:28:58] seventy years types what seven church
[1:28:59] ages i will visit you
[1:29:02] this was a major prophet declaring to
[1:29:05] the land
[1:29:06] that god is going to bring them right
[1:29:08] back and he says for
[1:29:10] i know the thoughts that i think towards
[1:29:12] you
[1:29:13] he's got greater thoughts towards you
[1:29:15] than sometimes what you think about
[1:29:17] yourself
[1:29:18] is that right we have some pretty bad
[1:29:20] thoughts about ourselves but
[1:29:21] god's got greater thoughts about you
[1:29:24] than what you think about yourself
[1:29:26] says the lord the thoughts of peace and
[1:29:29] not evil to give you
[1:29:30] an expected end an expected end
[1:29:34] it means expect it to come to its
[1:29:36] conclusion
[1:29:39] praise the lord then you shall call upon
[1:29:41] me what happened last night
[1:29:45] praise the lord what happened last night
[1:29:48] and you shall pray unto me and i will
[1:29:51] hearken unto you he says god's going to
[1:29:52] listen to you
[1:29:54] there's going to be a communication that
[1:29:56] connection
[1:29:58] and we want to see at the end of the
[1:30:00] bible how this
[1:30:02] comes and becomes becomes a reality and
[1:30:04] script
[1:30:05] scriptural principles in your life
[1:30:07] because we look at the bible sometimes
[1:30:09] and we see these symbols and we don't
[1:30:11] know what it means
[1:30:13] but these symbols are becoming expressed
[1:30:14] now and we will try to build up to this
[1:30:17] this uh where we come to uh what happens
[1:30:20] under the unveiling of that word
[1:30:22] he says then you shall seek me and find
[1:30:24] me
[1:30:26] now let's look at these these scriptures
[1:30:29] book of revelation
[1:30:30] he says and a voice come out of the
[1:30:32] throne this is after
[1:30:34] the lord has been speaking about mystery
[1:30:36] babylon in revelation 17 and revelations
[1:30:38] 18 is that right
[1:30:39] mystery babylon he's just been talking
[1:30:42] about the
[1:30:43] who sits on the seven hills he's all
[1:30:45] just been talking in revelation
[1:30:47] 18 about all the commerce and all the
[1:30:50] economics being controlled
[1:30:53] amen now he's going to he's he's
[1:30:56] showing all that's going to be on the
[1:30:58] earth in the political economic and
[1:31:00] religious realm
[1:31:01] but now he comes to show you a woman
[1:31:05] connected to a throne and a voice come
[1:31:08] out of the throne
[1:31:09] not the voices
[1:31:12] not voices a voice
[1:31:17] saying praise our god all ye servants
[1:31:19] and you that pharaoh both small and
[1:31:21] great and i heard as it was a voice
[1:31:23] of a great multitude he says a voice
[1:31:27] advocate multitude he didn't say voices
[1:31:29] of a great multitude he says a voice
[1:31:32] one voice reflected through a multitude
[1:31:37] connected to the one who has the
[1:31:40] inspiration giving it out
[1:31:42] a multitude of people with one voice
[1:31:47] not someone saying this one saying this
[1:31:49] one saying this and one saying then i
[1:31:50] think this and i think that
[1:31:53] one inspiration saying
[1:31:56] was a voice of mighty thundering saying
[1:31:58] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[1:32:00] reigneth let us be glad and be sad
[1:32:06] and don't say that in my bible
[1:32:10] and rejoice and give him honor
[1:32:14] for the marriage of the lamb not has
[1:32:16] come
[1:32:18] is this big difference
[1:32:23] and his wife made herself ready last
[1:32:26] night
[1:32:31] come on now what's been going on his
[1:32:34] wife
[1:32:34] has made herself ready she's found
[1:32:36] things in her life that wasn't right
[1:32:38] so she laid it at his feet he came took
[1:32:40] it away
[1:32:42] and said you had to desire it first
[1:32:44] before he could take it away
[1:32:47] amen when you come to god be transparent
[1:32:49] before god
[1:32:51] because there's nothing worse than that
[1:32:53] than a woman that's holding things in a
[1:32:55] heart
[1:32:56] you're not going to get at that part
[1:32:57] with that part that's why he preached
[1:32:59] doors
[1:33:00] inside of doors you open up the door he
[1:33:02] came into your
[1:33:03] into your house but these little rooms
[1:33:05] are going to be opened up praise the
[1:33:07] lord they got opened up last night
[1:33:09] and to her was grounded that she should
[1:33:11] be arrayed and find linen
[1:33:13] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:33:15] the righteousness of the saints
[1:33:17] praise the lord let's be our heads
[1:33:20] lord take these words now i pray lord
[1:33:22] god
[1:33:24] i just pray lord god i just thank you
[1:33:26] for this time that we've had
[1:33:28] but lord i just pray sow it all together
[1:33:30] lord and
[1:33:31] and just make it so real to us i ask in
[1:33:34] jesus name
[1:33:35] amen you may be seated
[1:33:38] you know uh when i this is the first
[1:33:41] time in 20 years i have ever
[1:33:43] gone and had and preached on not outside
[1:33:47] of a ministry
[1:33:48] outside of missionary meetings with
[1:33:50] other ministers
[1:33:53] over the last 20 years i refused to
[1:33:55] preach with other ministers
[1:33:57] but because of brother freddie
[1:34:00] and brother tez they are men of great
[1:34:03] character
[1:34:05] and i did not want to go and be
[1:34:09] with people who try to compete with each
[1:34:11] other
[1:34:13] because there's one thing that
[1:34:14] competition and is competition comes
[1:34:16] from the pizza hell
[1:34:18] competition is an invention of the devil
[1:34:22] and i saw great character in these men
[1:34:25] i said yeah lord i can i could preach
[1:34:28] with those two men
[1:34:30] because i've seen what god has done in
[1:34:32] their lives
[1:34:33] and i so very much appreciate them
[1:34:37] and may the lord bless them now brother
[1:34:40] branham says we're going
[1:34:41] we're going to start shallow and i'm
[1:34:43] going to get go deep
[1:34:44] so don't panic
[1:34:49] because that's just the way i start out
[1:34:50] now watch this quote i will watch this
[1:34:53] scripture
[1:34:54] now this is david and david
[1:34:57] is expressing something in his heart
[1:35:00] that is prophetic
[1:35:02] because the prophet of god says david is
[1:35:03] the type of church coming into power
[1:35:05] he's also son of david is the type of
[1:35:08] christ in the millennium but we take
[1:35:09] our types for us
[1:35:14] it says deep carth unto the deep that
[1:35:17] sounds like to omnipotence
[1:35:19] an omnipotent god calling out to an
[1:35:22] omnipotent
[1:35:23] attribute is that right that's you
[1:35:28] at the noise of thy water spout what's
[1:35:31] it that's an overflowing uh
[1:35:32] it's it's like a fountain of inspiration
[1:35:35] and faith
[1:35:37] all thy waves and thy billows are gone
[1:35:41] over me like last night
[1:35:44] now let's just look at this quote and
[1:35:46] then we're going to get into it
[1:35:48] before there can be a creation there has
[1:35:51] to be a creator to create the creation
[1:35:53] he said is that right
[1:35:54] if you're hungering for god to be healed
[1:35:57] there's a creator somewhere creating
[1:35:59] that desire
[1:36:00] in your heart it's like these things
[1:36:02] that you came up for last night
[1:36:04] you had a desire there to be changed who
[1:36:07] put that in you
[1:36:09] god put it in you so if god put it
[1:36:11] inside of you
[1:36:13] then there's something inside of you
[1:36:14] responding back to god you put the
[1:36:17] desire there
[1:36:18] praise the lord and he says as long as
[1:36:21] you believe there's a god that'll heal
[1:36:23] you there's a god somewhere that'll heal
[1:36:25] you that's right
[1:36:26] david said as the noise of thy
[1:36:28] waterspout you see
[1:36:30] the deep calling to the deep
[1:36:34] oh i say praise god what a subject
[1:36:38] where it can go now brother says now he
[1:36:42] alludes to to
[1:36:43] a fish says hair like this before there
[1:36:47] was ever a fin on a fish
[1:36:49] a fish's back there had to be water
[1:36:52] first for this
[1:36:53] for him to swim in or he wouldn't have
[1:36:56] no fin
[1:36:59] amen so now god puts an
[1:37:02] attribute in us that's calling for the
[1:37:06] place
[1:37:07] the attribute was made to occupy
[1:37:14] amen so eternity
[1:37:18] calls us because eternity is our natural
[1:37:21] place of existence
[1:37:26] new zealand's not my natural place of
[1:37:27] existence eternity
[1:37:30] is my natural place of existence and
[1:37:32] it's calling me
[1:37:34] to my natural place of existence
[1:37:37] praise the lord that place
[1:37:40] is not complete without you
[1:37:45] praise the lord amen
[1:37:49] god is not complete without you
[1:37:53] so he's calling out for his completion
[1:37:57] in you are you with me now
[1:38:00] so there's a deep on one end and a deep
[1:38:03] on the other end and each is responding
[1:38:06] to the needs of the other so god has
[1:38:09] needs
[1:38:10] you have needs those two needs have been
[1:38:12] calling out to each other
[1:38:14] is that right now god loves
[1:38:17] worship not just just any kind of
[1:38:21] worship
[1:38:22] but there's a there's a different kind
[1:38:24] of worship because
[1:38:26] worship must be connected to something
[1:38:28] you can't just have any kind of worship
[1:38:30] because pentecostals have a worship god
[1:38:32] says no
[1:38:35] the methodists have a worship god says
[1:38:37] no
[1:38:39] because i want a certain kind of worship
[1:38:41] because this worship
[1:38:42] must be connected to me for what i'm
[1:38:45] doing
[1:38:46] now
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:50] amen praise the lord now that big calls
[1:38:53] you to achieve worship
[1:38:55] to bring you to reflect the desire
[1:38:58] of god for your day
[1:39:02] amen because this that is
[1:39:05] is our true place of expression our
[1:39:08] place of representation
[1:39:09] now brother rem says thou now true
[1:39:11] worship is where he places his name
[1:39:16] now people say well what is this you
[1:39:18] know that everybody says well oh
[1:39:19] the name of the lord is jesus christ so
[1:39:21] the methodists think that pertains to
[1:39:23] them
[1:39:24] let's look now let's see if i got on a
[1:39:28] slide here
[1:39:29] this is what he says the word
[1:39:33] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[1:39:37] name of god
[1:39:39] this is deep now think deep the word
[1:39:43] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[1:39:47] name
[1:39:48] of god amen
[1:39:52] it says flesh and blood hath not real
[1:39:53] this revealed this to you but my father
[1:39:55] which is in
[1:39:56] heaven has revealed it this to you who
[1:39:59] i am and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:40:02] place of worship
[1:40:04] where where the word has been
[1:40:06] interpreted
[1:40:08] and the prophet god said how does god
[1:40:10] interpret his word by bringing it to
[1:40:12] pass so
[1:40:15] come on now put your thinking caps on if
[1:40:19] his word has to be interpreted he has to
[1:40:22] bring it to pass
[1:40:24] so therefore there's somebody who has to
[1:40:26] be the interpretation
[1:40:28] of the word for this day that god must
[1:40:30] go out
[1:40:31] and bring them to pass
[1:40:35] amen you still didn't get it
[1:40:39] you still didn't get it but we'll get
[1:40:42] there
[1:40:43] but we'll just go a little bit further
[1:40:44] he says and the gates of
[1:40:46] hal can't shake it
[1:40:50] down right he says
[1:40:53] the word interpreted
[1:40:57] as a manifestation of the name of jesus
[1:41:00] christ
[1:41:02] so now the word interpreted is not just
[1:41:05] finding out what something means
[1:41:08] because when the word interprets it must
[1:41:10] collect the recipients
[1:41:13] to bring that scripture to pass
[1:41:17] amen now do you get it so god
[1:41:21] has to have a bride at the end time to
[1:41:24] be the interpretation
[1:41:25] of the word for this day now mama eagle
[1:41:28] must go out and hunt
[1:41:30] down where's my interpretation
[1:41:36] amen i'm hunting down where's my
[1:41:38] interpretation
[1:41:39] i'm going to defend that with that woman
[1:41:41] and i'm going to bring her to pass
[1:41:44] i'm going to break the seal over her
[1:41:46] life she's going to interpret the word
[1:41:48] where and that is where my name is
[1:41:54] do you get it
[1:41:57] you are an interpretation for the
[1:42:00] scriptures for this day
[1:42:01] god has sought and god wants it to bring
[1:42:05] you to pass
[1:42:07] so god puts on his king theophany
[1:42:11] veil was this melchizedek
[1:42:16] coming to search out a part of himself
[1:42:19] to draw to be the interpretation of
[1:42:21] revelations 10
[1:42:23] verse 8 to 11. a people with a
[1:42:26] voice of god a multitude of people
[1:42:30] connected to one
[1:42:31] voice a voice of the resurrection
[1:42:35] you have resurrection power inside of
[1:42:38] you right now
[1:42:40] you are the throne of mercy right now
[1:42:43] but the throne of mercy must have a
[1:42:46] voice
[1:42:50] amen because this world is falling apart
[1:42:56] the lack of what love
[1:42:59] divine love and where can you get divine
[1:43:02] love
[1:43:02] you have to go where god is to find
[1:43:05] divine love
[1:43:06] and where is god in this hour he's not
[1:43:09] somebody just sitting on the throne up
[1:43:11] there
[1:43:11] that's so impersonal there is a person
[1:43:14] to connect with to connect to the throne
[1:43:17] of god
[1:43:18] and that person has a voice
[1:43:24] and that person has a voice and that
[1:43:26] person is the voice
[1:43:27] and that person is the voice and that
[1:43:29] person is the voice and they're all
[1:43:30] saying the same thing
[1:43:31] because it's a resurrection voice and
[1:43:33] that voice must be
[1:43:35] in unity
[1:43:39] to bring a resurrection the voice
[1:43:42] must be in unity
[1:43:45] the whole rapture is depending
[1:43:48] on a people saying the same thing
[1:43:51] because there are people beyond the
[1:43:53] curtain of time
[1:43:55] under expectation that there will be a
[1:43:58] people here
[1:43:59] under one voice one unity one
[1:44:02] one thought one revelation and it's
[1:44:04] creating an attraction
[1:44:09] do you believe it when brother man went
[1:44:12] beyond the curtain of time
[1:44:13] he says to them up there says do i have
[1:44:14] to go back he said you've got to go back
[1:44:17] he didn't want to go back no way he had
[1:44:19] to go back
[1:44:20] because if he didn't go back there
[1:44:22] wouldn't be a channel to open the book
[1:44:26] they knew more about what brother
[1:44:29] branham's ministry was
[1:44:30] than what brother branham did amen he
[1:44:34] said
[1:44:34] where's the lord they told him he said a
[1:44:36] little bit higher
[1:44:38] they knew what more about things there
[1:44:40] than what brother bradham did
[1:44:43] and they knew he had to go back because
[1:44:45] a book had to be unfolded
[1:44:49] to come down and and break the seal over
[1:44:52] your lives
[1:44:54] to take you out of the earthly up into
[1:44:56] the heavenly
[1:44:58] because you you may have been born in a
[1:45:00] chook house but i tell you something
[1:45:02] brethren there was not a chocolate
[1:45:03] nature inside of your soul
[1:45:06] amen he had to find that
[1:45:09] attribute and bring it into expression
[1:45:12] praise the lord oh my i'm off my notes i
[1:45:14] have to try and get myself back on the
[1:45:16] notes
[1:45:18] now
[1:45:21] in the sermon i think i might have a
[1:45:23] quote here let's have a look at this
[1:45:24] we're just going to go and just laying
[1:45:26] this out so
[1:45:28] we understand clearly now watch this
[1:45:31] the threefold revelation of god christ
[1:45:34] the mystery of god revealed
[1:45:36] the crisis the mystery of god revealed
[1:45:37] is is the prophet
[1:45:39] telling you what the seventh seal is
[1:45:43] amen i hope you understand i hope you've
[1:45:46] been reading it
[1:45:49] now just before he goes into 335 he says
[1:45:51] and what is it
[1:45:52] the holy ghost said i'll point him out
[1:45:57] that's the only way you'll know him
[1:45:58] today and only way you'll get
[1:46:00] the threefold revelation of god is for
[1:46:03] the holy ghost
[1:46:05] and the only way it can ever be is
[1:46:06] you're predestinated to see it
[1:46:09] i want to ask you who sees it
[1:46:12] what is the threefold revelation god
[1:46:15] revealing himself
[1:46:16] getting the preeminences over the people
[1:46:19] and taking them back to eden again
[1:46:21] is that right do you see it
[1:46:24] put up your hands if you see it but then
[1:46:27] he says you're predestinated
[1:46:32] wow so why am i frightened of things
[1:46:35] why am i intimidated i have been given
[1:46:38] the privilege
[1:46:39] of seeing the threefold revelation of
[1:46:42] god
[1:46:43] that no other age has ever been able to
[1:46:45] see and only the holy spirit could point
[1:46:47] it out
[1:46:48] to you and identify it to you so that
[1:46:50] you could say yeah i agree with that
[1:46:52] and that is god calling you to see a
[1:46:54] part of your reality
[1:46:56] is that right
[1:47:00] now watch now just building this up the
[1:47:02] three fold purpose the seventh seal
[1:47:06] just read this oh if god can get
[1:47:09] prisoners like that
[1:47:10] now that's when he can express the
[1:47:12] preeminence as you see
[1:47:13] he's got the man or the person so that
[1:47:16] he knows nothing but
[1:47:17] christ what was happening last night
[1:47:21] you're saying i've had enough for
[1:47:23] running my own life
[1:47:25] i'm giving preeminences to the lord
[1:47:28] why are you getting caught up into the
[1:47:30] manifestation of the second fold of the
[1:47:32] rapture
[1:47:34] amen because this body can only change
[1:47:38] around the word that is being revealed
[1:47:42] is that right now stay awake now because
[1:47:44] we're going to get right
[1:47:46] right into it you see what a main
[1:47:49] congregation says amen right says
[1:47:51] the first to express himself completely
[1:47:53] god in christ second to have preeminence
[1:47:55] was by this inner church which is his
[1:47:57] body the bride
[1:47:58] until he could have preeminences to
[1:48:00] express himself through them
[1:48:03] so we needed to be unblocked
[1:48:06] is that right the channels had to be
[1:48:09] unblocked
[1:48:10] we have some stuff inside us that god
[1:48:12] comes up i'm going to unblock that
[1:48:14] last night what's he's unblocking it
[1:48:16] because the holy spirit must have a
[1:48:18] free flow amen
[1:48:22] now watch now he says and thirdly to
[1:48:24] restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:48:26] position
[1:48:26] and we know that adoption on this side
[1:48:29] is going to take us to adoption the
[1:48:30] fullness of adoption the change of a
[1:48:32] body
[1:48:32] so he's positionally placing us so that
[1:48:35] he can trust us
[1:48:36] because he has to trust people to be his
[1:48:39] voice
[1:48:43] the devil don't want that he's a zen man
[1:48:48] so i can disturb that voice part
[1:48:51] if i can disturb that second fold part
[1:48:54] of the rapture
[1:48:55] because he knows if he could disturb
[1:48:57] that second fold part of the rapture
[1:48:59] he's got everything just delayed but the
[1:49:02] inevitable's coming
[1:49:03] this guy said i'll bring you to an
[1:49:04] expected end case closed
[1:49:07] so i can be happy and smile he's coming
[1:49:09] to an end
[1:49:10] amen praise the lord right now
[1:49:14] the threefold mystery was not for
[1:49:15] luther's day was not for wesley's day
[1:49:18] was
[1:49:18] not for pentecost day that's just a
[1:49:20] shuck but this wheat
[1:49:22] must have a threefold revelation before
[1:49:25] it can be taken into the barn
[1:49:27] so when that shark when that wheat
[1:49:29] leaves that shark
[1:49:30] and thus when the seals were revealed
[1:49:33] that wheat got expelled from laodicea
[1:49:36] and then it comes out green and it gets
[1:49:38] baked in the rising of the sun
[1:49:40] and then it comes to a place where god
[1:49:42] can use it
[1:49:43] and take it away and store it in the
[1:49:45] barn in an eternal dimension
[1:49:48] now when god sends a messenger we always
[1:49:50] say praise god we can see his position
[1:49:53] but he is there he is but he's there
[1:49:57] to show us our position the messenger
[1:50:00] was only the channel for the first fold
[1:50:03] of the rapture amen
[1:50:09] so he comes and shows us our genetic
[1:50:12] connection to god
[1:50:14] the bloodline oh i love this stuff
[1:50:19] the bloodline the bloodline
[1:50:23] contains the genetics amen
[1:50:29] eliezer had his position
[1:50:33] but he came to rebecca to reveal her
[1:50:35] position
[1:50:36] he came to reveal the mystery of her
[1:50:38] life because isaac could only marry
[1:50:41] one of the same bloodline
[1:50:45] so he was when eliezer came when brother
[1:50:48] branham came
[1:50:49] he was searching for the connections to
[1:50:51] that bloodline
[1:50:53] praise the lord he couldn't find it no
[1:50:55] chuck house
[1:50:57] until he looked at an eagle that was
[1:50:59] trapped down there
[1:51:02] but inside that eagle was a connection
[1:51:04] to the bloodline
[1:51:06] and he says when you heard from that
[1:51:09] you heard from your theophany
[1:51:14] years ago brother richard oliver gave me
[1:51:15] a tape
[1:51:17] a brother branham on it
[1:51:21] and i just put it into the cassette
[1:51:23] recorder and i listened to
[1:51:25] about a few seconds
[1:51:28] and i got the shock of my life i said
[1:51:32] i've heard that voice before
[1:51:34] not the kentuckian voice but there was
[1:51:36] another voice on that voice
[1:51:39] i said i've heard that voice before
[1:51:41] [Applause]
[1:51:43] way back in eternity i heard that voice
[1:51:46] and that voice
[1:51:47] came to connect me to the bloodline and
[1:51:50] then
[1:51:50] for the next few years my goodness me
[1:51:55] i was put on the threshing floor
[1:52:04] the threshing floor is in the book of
[1:52:06] ruth is that right
[1:52:07] you decide is that right ruth decided
[1:52:10] then she labored
[1:52:12] she had a long hair long dresses got rid
[1:52:14] of a long face
[1:52:16] she came into connection with the chief
[1:52:18] reaper and she was feeding on the
[1:52:20] on the on the word until some mysteries
[1:52:22] were where we're breaking all around her
[1:52:24] and then she goes and she meets boaz and
[1:52:27] when she comes to chapter three
[1:52:28] she goes and meets boaz on the threshing
[1:52:31] floor now god puts things in the bible
[1:52:33] for a specific purpose
[1:52:34] because the threshing floor is not so we
[1:52:36] were oh this is a nice place to sleep
[1:52:38] look there's some hay down there
[1:52:39] oh let's just go and lie down
[1:52:40] comfortable it's not about that
[1:52:43] because on the threshing floor boaz said
[1:52:45] i'm going to complete everything for you
[1:52:47] ruth
[1:52:48] you rest is that right god's doing the
[1:52:51] work he'll complete the whole thing
[1:52:53] but you're on the threshing floor and on
[1:52:56] the threshing floor
[1:52:57] god was getting rid of ruth chaff
[1:53:02] oh my god he was getting rid of some
[1:53:06] south african chaff
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:09] some new zealand chaff he was getting
[1:53:12] rid of our chaff he was getting rid of
[1:53:13] her mower bike chaff
[1:53:15] because of that was not her
[1:53:17] identification
[1:53:19] so he had to get rid of her old identity
[1:53:21] by putting on the thrashing floor and
[1:53:23] getting rid of the chaff
[1:53:26] why when you think of yourself as a new
[1:53:27] zealander don't look at your stupid
[1:53:29] chaff
[1:53:32] you're trying to stick your child back
[1:53:34] on get some chaff
[1:53:36] glue it back on that's not that's not
[1:53:38] what he's doing man
[1:53:40] he's taking it off
[1:53:43] when at the time when the rapture's been
[1:53:45] revealed
[1:53:47] because that's the second part of the
[1:53:48] rapture now is that right on the
[1:53:50] threshing floor
[1:53:52] to connect you to the voice that came
[1:53:56] down from heaven
[1:53:58] praise the lord now this deep
[1:54:02] deep in isaac was calling for the deep
[1:54:05] in rebecca in rebecca
[1:54:07] and the seventh seal was breaking over
[1:54:10] rebecca
[1:54:11] to pull her from the earthly to the
[1:54:14] heavenly
[1:54:15] so i want you to come up higher now
[1:54:17] rebecca i want you to just come up a
[1:54:19] little bit higher
[1:54:20] and a little bit higher and you'll be
[1:54:22] coming up higher and
[1:54:23] higher on a seven step higher all the
[1:54:26] way up
[1:54:27] and and another dimensions breaking over
[1:54:29] you there's a dawning of another day
[1:54:31] you find out oh man this this every time
[1:54:34] you look at this this cosmos out there
[1:54:36] this world order you get more sicker and
[1:54:38] sicker
[1:54:39] looking at it what's that that's the
[1:54:40] dawning of a new day
[1:54:42] an eternal day is breaking over you
[1:54:46] i could care less who's in power he
[1:54:49] cares
[1:54:51] god's in control do you believe it
[1:54:54] i say pray this this shocks everyone
[1:54:56] when i say it
[1:54:58] shocked people in europe so if it shocks
[1:55:01] people i see it
[1:55:02] i'm so thankful for satan's eden
[1:55:09] says a crazy man i am crazy
[1:55:12] i've lost my mind he's lost his mind yes
[1:55:14] i have i've got his mind
[1:55:16] praise the lord satan's eden i
[1:55:20] thank god for it
[1:55:23] because i have to be developed in a dark
[1:55:26] room
[1:55:29] is that right my negative has to
[1:55:32] be developed in a dark dark
[1:55:35] room because when brother brandon
[1:55:39] preached that there was no digital
[1:55:40] cameras
[1:55:44] wasn't all these people
[1:55:49] you couldn't do that cost too much money
[1:55:53] bring them back please
[1:55:56] and take the telephones off them too but
[1:55:58] anyway you have to be developed and that
[1:56:01] satan's eaten and satan says
[1:56:06] i've got them now i says no you ain't
[1:56:10] i just put them down here i put my
[1:56:12] attribute down here
[1:56:14] amongst hell not in hell amongst hell
[1:56:18] and i'm working out a secret program in
[1:56:21] a secret place
[1:56:23] is that right brother ferdi a secret
[1:56:25] place there right brother that's what a
[1:56:27] secret place
[1:56:31] and satan can't see it happening because
[1:56:33] it's
[1:56:34] private
[1:56:37] it's a secret only known between you and
[1:56:41] god
[1:56:43] and when i'm down here and i'm walking
[1:56:46] around
[1:56:47] in satan's eden there's been things
[1:56:49] coming across my path to expose things
[1:56:52] in my genetics
[1:56:54] and god says i don't want that there so
[1:56:57] you bring it to the rising of the sun
[1:56:59] and he burns it out and also develops
[1:57:02] the picture
[1:57:04] amen i'll give you a little test
[1:57:06] testimony
[1:57:07] i'm unfortunately in my flesh at nearly
[1:57:10] 63 years old
[1:57:11] horrors upon horus but only three weeks
[1:57:15] ago
[1:57:16] i overcame something within my natural
[1:57:19] genetics had been going through from
[1:57:21] generations
[1:57:23] and i've been praying about it and
[1:57:25] praying about it it was taunting me
[1:57:27] for all my life i said lord i can't
[1:57:31] carry on with that thing taunting me
[1:57:34] and i'd go and i'd walk up and down the
[1:57:36] road at night up and down up and down
[1:57:38] sometimes two o'clock in the morning my
[1:57:39] wife would probably
[1:57:40] didn't even know that i was out there
[1:57:41] praying up and down the road i'd be on
[1:57:43] the concrete on my face
[1:57:44] get rid of this thing and the other day
[1:57:47] i realized
[1:57:48] it ain't there
[1:57:54] he didn't say he'd take it straight away
[1:57:57] that's why when i was in here last night
[1:57:59] watching all these people coming up
[1:58:01] and getting delivered i was saying
[1:58:02] praise the lord when i saw these little
[1:58:05] ones down here with their hands up
[1:58:07] praising praising god i thought wow man
[1:58:11] god is so powerful everything that the
[1:58:14] devil thought he could hold back
[1:58:17] god said i'll bring you to your expected
[1:58:18] ends amen
[1:58:20] praise the lord let's go deeper oh my
[1:58:23] when i say deeper they go
[1:58:25] don't worry
[1:58:33] so when eliezer was sent by abraham to
[1:58:35] find a bride for isaac he went out
[1:58:36] searching for a genetic connection
[1:58:38] and that genetic connection responded
[1:58:40] back is that right
[1:58:42] eliezer was carrying his master's goods
[1:58:44] he had
[1:58:45] six earthly seals and a heavenly seventh
[1:58:47] seal
[1:58:48] he was carrying his master's goods so
[1:58:51] that he could show you
[1:58:53] your earthly your earthly lineage
[1:58:56] and then show you your supernatural
[1:58:58] lineage and you were always walking
[1:59:00] around
[1:59:00] with a six-seal lineage
[1:59:04] is that right so then god said now i'm
[1:59:06] going to reveal the other part
[1:59:08] and that part's got nothing to do with
[1:59:10] the earth because eliezer was carrying
[1:59:12] the goods now
[1:59:13] his master's goods to impart
[1:59:17] to a woman amen
[1:59:21] now she didn't let her earthly book of
[1:59:23] life control her
[1:59:24] this is your earthly book of life now
[1:59:26] come on now
[1:59:28] this is your earthly book of life but
[1:59:30] you have an eternal section
[1:59:32] and the book of life and this here is
[1:59:34] the lamb's book
[1:59:36] and the lab's book speaks
[1:59:39] greater things is that right
[1:59:42] see she alleged and she she didn't say
[1:59:45] i'm a modern woman
[1:59:48] amen she didn't say
[1:59:52] i need my job first
[1:59:56] what is it guys quiet i want to say
[1:59:59] i have my ambitions
[2:00:03] i've got my rights
[2:00:06] i wonder what gender i should be
[2:00:14] i think i should go out and protest
[2:00:20] i shocked one man one day when i was
[2:00:22] overseas
[2:00:23] he's out on the streets protesting about
[2:00:25] wearing masks
[2:00:27] i said boy what do you think you are
[2:00:30] doing
[2:00:32] jesus said if this kingdom was mine my
[2:00:35] disciples would fight for me
[2:00:38] so what are you doing out on the streets
[2:00:41] fighting for something that you're not
[2:00:43] meant to be inheriting
[2:00:46] is that right i'm not interested what
[2:00:49] the serpent said out there once
[2:00:52] they're just squatters the squad is
[2:00:54] brethren
[2:00:56] they're squatters are temporary
[2:00:58] inhabitants
[2:01:00] so that don't mean much to me they
[2:01:01] haven't even paid 6 000 years
[2:01:04] of rent to me
[2:01:11] you don't pay rent you're getting
[2:01:13] evicted
[2:01:16] i've got a title deed that says you
[2:01:19] ain't been paying rent
[2:01:22] praise the lord
[2:01:26] oh you're an eccentric man i am
[2:01:29] i just want to be i wanted it's where
[2:01:31] the rubber meets the road you know
[2:01:33] praise the lord she didn't reason with
[2:01:36] the messenger
[2:01:37] she didn't find faults with the
[2:01:38] messenger she didn't go on the websites
[2:01:41] to find things about the messenger that
[2:01:42] she didn't think that was uh
[2:01:44] you know what i mean
[2:01:48] the messenger messenger carried a
[2:01:50] familiar voice
[2:01:52] the deep code unto the deep and the
[2:01:54] waterspouts of
[2:01:55] inspiration was responding and he says
[2:01:58] it's faith
[2:02:00] praise the lord so eliezer came
[2:02:04] searching for a common bloodline that
[2:02:06] was connected to rebecca's future
[2:02:08] husband
[2:02:10] the bloodline to the same bloodline
[2:02:14] so when god sent out the messenger with
[2:02:16] the message at the end time god was
[2:02:17] awakening us to our supernatural
[2:02:19] bloodline
[2:02:21] and the prophet said that when jesus
[2:02:23] went to calvary
[2:02:24] we were in him
[2:02:28] let's do you believe it well he showed
[2:02:30] me in the old testament
[2:02:34] amen it's got to be in the old testament
[2:02:40] was jesus our high priest
[2:02:43] then aaron was a high priest so if jesus
[2:02:46] is our high priest and we were in him
[2:02:49] when he went to calvary i want to see it
[2:02:50] in the old testament
[2:02:53] did you know that when that high priest
[2:02:54] went into the holy of holies he had to
[2:02:55] be dressed a certain way he had a mitre
[2:02:57] on his head he fought he had the
[2:02:58] breastplate he had the euro of summon
[2:03:00] and he had some bowels on the bottom of
[2:03:01] his
[2:03:01] uh um the robe that he was wearing
[2:03:05] and he had to go into that once a year
[2:03:08] with the blood
[2:03:09] to atone for all the people for
[2:03:11] everything they've done over a whole
[2:03:12] year is that right
[2:03:14] so jesus now remember they had to be
[2:03:17] done
[2:03:17] every year but jesus did it once for us
[2:03:19] all is that right once finished done for
[2:03:21] he was our sin offering he was our burnt
[2:03:23] offering here was our trespass offering
[2:03:25] he was all the offerings and one man he
[2:03:28] only had to do it
[2:03:29] once but in the old testament it was
[2:03:32] over and over and over and over and over
[2:03:34] so when aaron
[2:03:35] had to go in on the feast of atonement
[2:03:37] he took
[2:03:40] and put over his heart a breastplate
[2:03:44] with seven stones in the breastplate
[2:03:47] that right underneath the breastplate
[2:03:50] was the urim thumb and with the names on
[2:03:51] it
[2:03:52] now those stones had names on the stones
[2:03:57] and he was they were the names over the
[2:04:00] heart
[2:04:01] of the high priest so when he went and
[2:04:04] he atoned for the people
[2:04:05] he atoned for every name over his heart
[2:04:13] praise the lord when jesus went to
[2:04:16] calvary a time for every name
[2:04:18] in the book that was written at his
[2:04:21] heart
[2:04:21] so when we when he went to calvary we
[2:04:24] were there
[2:04:25] in him now when that high priest he put
[2:04:29] seven looks of blood on the uh
[2:04:30] mercy seat and we know that time's when
[2:04:33] jesus
[2:04:33] went into and went up in the cloud and
[2:04:35] he put seven licks over he went with uh
[2:04:38] he went for seven church ages the holy
[2:04:40] spirit pulled out for seven church ages
[2:04:42] which is the life of the blood
[2:04:46] now that blood had to have a voice
[2:04:50] amen a searching
[2:04:53] voice and when every
[2:04:56] any messenger came out for their age
[2:05:00] they had a voice of the blood
[2:05:03] where is the other end to the bloodline
[2:05:07] searching searching searching
[2:05:11] for a part of himself praise the lord
[2:05:15] but you know that high priest he had an
[2:05:18] onyx stone on his shoulder here and an
[2:05:20] onyx stone on his shoulder here
[2:05:22] six names here and six tribal names here
[2:05:27] oh what a deep mystery are you ready
[2:05:31] the government shall be upon his
[2:05:34] shoulders
[2:05:35] [Applause]
[2:05:38] of the names in the book for seven
[2:05:41] church ages
[2:05:42] the government was given to the body
[2:05:47] as long as the head was controlling the
[2:05:49] body it was going to be righteous
[2:05:50] judgment
[2:05:53] amen praise the lord
[2:05:56] and he jesus went to calvary with us in
[2:05:59] him
[2:06:00] for the joy that was set before him
[2:06:03] come on now stay awake
[2:06:08] have we got to the heavy material yet
[2:06:14] now he went there knowing his attributes
[2:06:16] were going to be put into sex-born
[2:06:18] bodies is that right
[2:06:22] he knew it
[2:06:25] and allotted through a period of time
[2:06:30] he did not intend any of you here to be
[2:06:32] born in the f-1500
[2:06:34] says i have an attribute in me i have
[2:06:37] all these attributes in me and i must
[2:06:39] place them strategically
[2:06:41] i cannot place uh the ones in luther's
[2:06:44] day
[2:06:45] in this day because they haven't got
[2:06:47] that which i
[2:06:48] put in that attribute for that time they
[2:06:51] had to be an attribute
[2:06:52] with the instilled characteristics in it
[2:06:55] for the age
[2:06:56] apostle paul wanted to live in this day
[2:06:59] but but the lord says no
[2:07:02] so he made apostle paul the pattern for
[2:07:04] the church ages of every minister
[2:07:05] of every star of every uh church age
[2:07:08] messenger
[2:07:09] and everybody that has that
[2:07:12] that is used by god and that um ministry
[2:07:14] has to be
[2:07:15] in the same expression as what paul was
[2:07:19] displaying
[2:07:21] amen praise the lord
[2:07:24] now here we are born in this world with
[2:07:27] amnesia
[2:07:30] amen didn't know nothing
[2:07:34] were you expecting god to call you no
[2:07:37] not when i've been just been milking
[2:07:39] cows minding my own business milking
[2:07:41] cows
[2:07:42] so i just call myself a farmer but god
[2:07:44] was searching me out
[2:07:46] but i was born with amnesia and how do i
[2:07:50] come into the world with amnesia i came
[2:07:52] into the world
[2:07:52] i was affected by a whole bunch of
[2:07:56] lineage all the way back
[2:07:59] now think about this brothers and
[2:08:00] sisters i'm just digressing now
[2:08:04] god fills all time and space with his
[2:08:07] knowledge
[2:08:08] not his presence otherwise the devil
[2:08:09] would be born again
[2:08:12] all time and space with his knowledge
[2:08:15] so when he's looking all through down
[2:08:17] the ions
[2:08:18] of time
[2:08:22] now catch this you have a theophany
[2:08:27] which is the real you the real word body
[2:08:30] your soul goes
[2:08:31] into is that right but god
[2:08:35] who is so enormous in his knowledge
[2:08:40] he knows you must look like that
[2:08:46] amen so he goes all the way back for
[2:08:50] hundreds of years
[2:08:52] mixing lineages
[2:08:56] connecting this with this this with this
[2:08:58] this with this this with this
[2:08:59] until you come out in your day and what
[2:09:02] when you're the age of 20 you look like
[2:09:04] that
[2:09:08] without the warts
[2:09:12] it's the greatest weight loss program
[2:09:18] they have to pay for things have been
[2:09:19] paid for you at calvary
[2:09:22] amen praise the lord
[2:09:26] you know brother man went beyond the
[2:09:27] curtain of time and then he sees her
[2:09:30] hope there guess what she's got the same
[2:09:34] color here
[2:09:35] and the same black eyes she had before
[2:09:38] she went there
[2:09:40] she's exactly the same so your stature
[2:09:44] and it's uh un defiled state
[2:09:49] is there waiting and
[2:09:52] trying to connect to you now
[2:09:57] this way says you're bumping
[2:10:00] into angels and theophanies is just
[2:10:04] another expression of it's not angels
[2:10:06] with wings now
[2:10:08] the word angel means masses of different
[2:10:10] things
[2:10:11] you are you are bumping into angels
[2:10:14] that's another subject i don't want to
[2:10:16] want to go into
[2:10:17] now
[2:10:21] the expectation is not on your behalf
[2:10:25] the expectation is god's expectation
[2:10:30] is that right so when you came into this
[2:10:32] world born with amnesia the expectation
[2:10:35] was
[2:10:35] god's you did not know anything
[2:10:38] about that you were chosen but god must
[2:10:41] go
[2:10:42] and maneuver you to a certain place
[2:10:45] and then start to get you to look at
[2:10:47] familiar things
[2:10:49] things that you did not know about way
[2:10:52] back in eternity but there's something
[2:10:54] in your soul it's registering with
[2:10:56] something
[2:10:57] and he says keep looking and keep
[2:10:59] looking now the expectation is the
[2:11:02] lord's expectation
[2:11:05] you ain't got enough expectation for
[2:11:07] nothing sometimes
[2:11:09] but it's the lord's expectation it was
[2:11:11] the lord's expectation for the prodigal
[2:11:13] son
[2:11:14] it was the lord's expectation for that
[2:11:16] soldier boy
[2:11:17] is that right you know the one about the
[2:11:18] soldier boy god was pointing out the
[2:11:21] the soldiers were pointing him to a tank
[2:11:23] on the hill and he looked and he looked
[2:11:25] and he start walking at what he was
[2:11:27] looking at
[2:11:29] and then the father came out so i knew
[2:11:31] you'd come back
[2:11:34] i knew you'd come back they're right
[2:11:37] don't matter how bad is i knew you'd
[2:11:40] come back
[2:11:41] praise the lord let's go deeper
[2:11:47] praise the lord
[2:11:54] now inside of a woman is a facility
[2:11:57] that awakens her that's why you
[2:12:00] men have got to be careful how you speak
[2:12:02] to women
[2:12:04] because women attracted by words
[2:12:07] you can say you're so beautiful and she
[2:12:09] falls in love
[2:12:14] help the sisters a man
[2:12:18] looks and is attracted by what he looks
[2:12:20] at a woman is attracted by what she
[2:12:23] hears is that right
[2:12:27] so faith comes by
[2:12:30] hearing oh i'm in love
[2:12:34] i'm hearing something from another
[2:12:36] dimension i'm falling in love with what
[2:12:38] i'm hearing
[2:12:40] because i'm attracted to what i hear
[2:12:43] and then he says something echoes inside
[2:12:46] of you
[2:12:48] is that what he said about the ego
[2:12:50] there's something echoed inside of him
[2:12:52] when he heard that voice it was an echo
[2:12:54] inside of him
[2:12:55] because an echo is something reflecting
[2:12:57] as rebounding off something
[2:13:02] now listen to this i want to get about
[2:13:05] when and angelic visitations
[2:13:09] are you with me so far now okay
[2:13:12] this is it's going to grip it's going to
[2:13:14] grip
[2:13:17] when gabriel came to mary he came to
[2:13:20] show her
[2:13:21] her position is that right
[2:13:24] so gabriel doesn't say oh well you're a
[2:13:26] nice girl i'm going to uh
[2:13:28] you have to be the one you know he
[2:13:29] doesn't do that he goes and shows her
[2:13:32] her place in the scriptures
[2:13:35] and angel always brings you back to your
[2:13:37] scriptural
[2:13:38] representation now when she saw her
[2:13:41] scriptural representation
[2:13:43] what happened to her a seal broke over
[2:13:46] her life
[2:13:48] and then she got lifted up into a higher
[2:13:51] expectation
[2:13:52] is that right and it's what god's been
[2:13:54] doing with us and so
[2:13:56] and so when when he when he came to her
[2:13:58] he came to break the seal over her book
[2:14:00] of life
[2:14:02] and show her name in the book and that
[2:14:05] what happened to her her voice responded
[2:14:09] back be it unto me
[2:14:13] is that right her prophetic
[2:14:16] identity on one hand had to be connected
[2:14:19] with the realization on the other end
[2:14:22] though these things that are going on
[2:14:24] there's a season for it
[2:14:29] he must draw the person and the prophecy
[2:14:33] together
[2:14:38] now when gabriel came to daniel he came
[2:14:41] to show him his position
[2:14:43] and connect him to the prophetic
[2:14:45] fulfillment of his day
[2:14:47] there right because daniel was looking
[2:14:50] in the prophecy of jeremiah and he was
[2:14:52] not
[2:14:52] understanding everything going on so god
[2:14:55] had to send an angel
[2:14:57] to daniel to give him the understanding
[2:14:59] what was in jeremiah's message books
[2:15:09] oh my my wake them up lord
[2:15:14] so there it was and he was stirred he
[2:15:17] was looking in the message box we've
[2:15:19] only got two years left
[2:15:22] amen so angel had to come
[2:15:26] and settle him down and
[2:15:29] ground him and who he was
[2:15:32] and the part of the prophecy
[2:15:37] and then daniel entered into a prayer
[2:15:39] time
[2:15:41] and the understanding started to break
[2:15:45] all over him
[2:15:46] and the time of the evening
[2:15:50] sacrifice
[2:15:54] my oh
[2:15:57] wow what does that mean
[2:16:03] what does that mean where are we my
[2:16:06] friends
[2:16:08] we are in a strategic time
[2:16:12] and god is a god that keeps his
[2:16:14] appointments
[2:16:16] and he's connecting you to the reality
[2:16:19] of what's unfolding in the scriptures
[2:16:22] right now now i want to show you
[2:16:27] what is happening right now
[2:16:30] it's why the devil always attacks me so
[2:16:31] much i've got to shut that guy up
[2:16:38] seeing a few mom send another million
[2:16:40] demons to shut the guy up
[2:16:44] the evening sacrifice is the key
[2:16:47] to what is happening right now
[2:16:52] now if we can understand this all things
[2:16:56] connect together at a time called the
[2:16:59] evening sacrifice yes
[2:17:03] now strategic now now put our thinking
[2:17:07] caps on
[2:17:09] the old testament is this type of the is
[2:17:11] a shadow of the new is that right
[2:17:12] brothers and sisters
[2:17:14] in the old testament there was a morning
[2:17:16] sacrifice
[2:17:18] and there was an evening sacrifice a
[2:17:21] sacrifice of a lamb in the morning
[2:17:23] and a sacrifice of a lamb in the evening
[2:17:25] to atone for the sins
[2:17:26] of that day
[2:17:30] every day 11 in the morning and a lamb
[2:17:33] in the evening
[2:17:35] in the old testament i tell you
[2:17:36] something there must been a lot of lambs
[2:17:40] around
[2:17:42] so now that was just covering sin
[2:17:45] in the old testament now that sin needed
[2:17:47] someone to come and remit it completely
[2:17:50] following types so when jesus came
[2:17:54] he had to follow the types it was in the
[2:17:56] old testament
[2:17:58] he can't get out of the types amen
[2:18:01] praise the lord now
[2:18:05] the morning sacrifice was at the third
[2:18:08] hour of the day nine
[2:18:10] o'clock the evening sacrifice was at the
[2:18:14] ninth hour of the day
[2:18:16] three o'clock so alam had to be slaying
[2:18:20] at nine o'clock and another one
[2:18:24] at three o'clock
[2:18:27] to atone for the sins of the people for
[2:18:29] that day
[2:18:31] in the old testament now when jesus
[2:18:34] comes along
[2:18:37] he's the lamb who will take away the
[2:18:38] sins of the world
[2:18:40] and he's won them and he must be
[2:18:43] crucified at
[2:18:46] the third hour of the day nine o'clock
[2:18:53] and he dies
[2:18:56] at the sixth era of the at the ninth era
[2:18:58] of the day three o'clock
[2:19:01] so he's a lamb who was the morning
[2:19:04] sacrifice
[2:19:05] and the lamb that was the evening
[2:19:07] sacrifice
[2:19:08] is that right praise the lord
[2:19:11] now these are just keys to where we are
[2:19:15] now
[2:19:17] amen oh it's good that you're waking up
[2:19:24] amen now these are shadows because
[2:19:27] this day completes everything
[2:19:30] shadows blended to reality because the
[2:19:34] life of the blood is the spirit of god
[2:19:38] praise the lord so now the holy spirit
[2:19:42] the life of the blood had to now go out
[2:19:48] and interpret itself scriptures
[2:19:52] for acts chapter 1 and 2.
[2:19:55] joel needed interpreting
[2:20:00] amen so the holy ghost goes out where's
[2:20:04] my interpretation
[2:20:07] amen come on now where's my
[2:20:10] interpretation
[2:20:11] so he goes and searches where's my
[2:20:13] interpretation and there's only 120 left
[2:20:16] in the upper room amen
[2:20:19] left here's my interpretation
[2:20:27] here comes the holy ghost to vindicate
[2:20:29] his interpretation
[2:20:31] i have brought them to pass and when the
[2:20:34] holy ghost falls
[2:20:35] peter points him back to joel you
[2:20:38] are that being interpreted
[2:20:44] the lord
[2:20:47] but there's another sacrifice
[2:20:50] there's an evening sacrifice
[2:20:55] seven church ages later
[2:21:04] so in that when jesus went to calvary it
[2:21:08] was paid for the redemption of our souls
[2:21:11] is that right
[2:21:12] but we need the redemption of our bodies
[2:21:17] so there must be another sacrifice
[2:21:19] another type i'm talking about now okay
[2:21:21] you're with me now we know that the seed
[2:21:24] had to go into the ground for seven
[2:21:26] church ages eaten up by
[2:21:27] uh by a roman spirit the church ages and
[2:21:30] a seed cannot
[2:21:31] if it doesn't go into the ground it
[2:21:32] doesn't it's got to
[2:21:34] to go into the ground and then come up
[2:21:36] again under luther and wesley and
[2:21:38] pentecost under that reformation
[2:21:40] but he says i shall restore all things
[2:21:42] not some things at the time of the
[2:21:45] evening time sacrifice message
[2:21:51] amen so a lamb in the morning to redeem
[2:21:54] the soul
[2:21:54] a lamb in the evening to redeem our
[2:21:56] bodies and it's the same lamb
[2:22:01] different offices you're with me
[2:22:05] praise the lord now
[2:22:11] here comes eliezer going down
[2:22:15] in genesis to a little woman
[2:22:18] who's coming to water camels
[2:22:22] at the well when does she come down
[2:22:27] in the evening time
[2:22:31] amen and she don't know
[2:22:35] she's got an appointment with the seal
[2:22:37] breaking over her book of life
[2:22:41] praise the lord genesis chapter 24 verse
[2:22:45] 11 and he made his camels to kneel down
[2:22:47] without the city by the well of water at
[2:22:48] the time of the evening
[2:22:50] the time that women go out to draw water
[2:22:55] are we drawing water brethren
[2:22:59] amen this is water drawing
[2:23:02] time praise the lord
[2:23:06] the message came in evening time there
[2:23:08] shall be light
[2:23:09] in the evening time and the evening time
[2:23:12] is when the woman draws
[2:23:14] water from the well himself not for some
[2:23:17] dirty old system
[2:23:21] amen some message churches have turned
[2:23:25] into a bunch of dirty old systems
[2:23:32] it's the truth
[2:23:35] i'll just give you a little bit of a
[2:23:36] testimony just for a moment oh my
[2:23:38] goodness having a god forever here
[2:23:41] i got invited to preach somewhere if i
[2:23:43] sit in a certain country
[2:23:46] and i've just been taking a meeting and
[2:23:49] of course after a meeting i've just worn
[2:23:50] out man
[2:23:52] and this fella comes up to me and says i
[2:23:54] like to pay your air tickets and your
[2:23:56] wife's air tickets to come to
[2:23:57] uh our country and preach now after a
[2:23:59] meeting i'm just not there in my head
[2:24:01] very well
[2:24:03] i'm just worn out and
[2:24:06] but see even though i'm worn out my head
[2:24:08] my eagle eye is real
[2:24:12] sharp
[2:24:14] it's a real sharp man
[2:24:18] and i looked and and i thought look i'll
[2:24:20] call you back in three days
[2:24:22] i'm just not in the right frame of mind
[2:24:24] but i was looking at him minister in the
[2:24:28] message
[2:24:29] i just won't tell you what nation it was
[2:24:30] it could be anywhere over the last 10
[2:24:32] years
[2:24:35] but i looked at his clothes
[2:24:38] he was so flesh i nearly needed to
[2:24:42] wear arc welding glasses because of the
[2:24:45] sheen that was coming off of it
[2:24:48] he was so delicately attired and here's
[2:24:51] me on my
[2:24:52] cheek jacket and i'm going
[2:24:55] god so i flapped my wings
[2:24:59] and had a look at his wife
[2:25:03] and she was dressed like a lamborghini
[2:25:08] i thought man there's something wrong
[2:25:10] here
[2:25:15] so i was flying around and having a good
[2:25:17] look
[2:25:18] so i can't go there i find out he
[2:25:21] believes that he's in the millennium
[2:25:22] right now
[2:25:24] and i'm flying around something's wrong
[2:25:26] something's wrong
[2:25:28] he believes his body's already glorified
[2:25:30] and he's in the millennium
[2:25:32] well you know if somebody comes up to me
[2:25:33] and tells me this i say
[2:25:35] have you had a cold lately where does a
[2:25:38] cold come from
[2:25:40] a demon well in the millennium satan's
[2:25:42] bound down for a thousand years
[2:25:44] so if you've got a cold you ain't in the
[2:25:46] millennium mate
[2:25:49] use your logic i've got the quotes i've
[2:25:52] got the quotes i've got proposed yet but
[2:25:53] i've got the revelation
[2:25:58] amen come on now i'm not so stupid
[2:26:01] to put those quotes and say i'm in the
[2:26:03] millennium right now sure we're under a
[2:26:05] millennial anointing
[2:26:07] but we ain't in the millennium yet
[2:26:12] amen come on man
[2:26:16] i use my gentle persuasion to say
[2:26:20] no i really can't come at the moment
[2:26:22] thank you very much i have to go back to
[2:26:24] new zealand sometime in the future i
[2:26:25] didn't tell him exactly
[2:26:27] i just tried to get out of it now watch
[2:26:30] now
[2:26:31] the time of the the evening time feast
[2:26:34] now watch in john chapter 7 verse 37 and
[2:26:37] the last day that great day of the feast
[2:26:39] jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[2:26:41] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[2:26:43] now where did jesus say that it wasn't
[2:26:46] at the feast of passover
[2:26:47] it wasn't at the feast of pentecost it
[2:26:49] was at the feast of
[2:26:50] tabernacles and we are in that feast
[2:26:54] right now and that feast of tabernacles
[2:26:57] is a feast that takes you to a
[2:26:59] change of your body
[2:27:03] amen in the evening time
[2:27:07] and here he puts it puts it in the book
[2:27:09] of john and john
[2:27:10] is an eagle and john is
[2:27:13] under an anointing and he he's he's a
[2:27:16] john's writing it
[2:27:17] and he's putting it it's in an eagle
[2:27:19] book to show the people
[2:27:21] get your eagle eyes on what's happening
[2:27:23] all around you scriptures are being
[2:27:25] fulfilled amen now
[2:27:30] this part is real good amen this is
[2:27:34] real good what's coming up now
[2:27:38] if i say it's real good man when i saw
[2:27:41] it i thought
[2:27:42] praise god i preached this in south
[2:27:43] africa
[2:27:46] let's have a look at something here
[2:27:49] now everything has a prophetic bar on it
[2:27:54] if you go to a railway line there's a
[2:27:56] bar do not
[2:27:58] go over the railway line otherwise
[2:27:59] you'll end up in hospital having clint
[2:28:02] hit a train see where there's a train
[2:28:05] coming there's a bar there
[2:28:07] and when the train goes through bar goes
[2:28:10] up
[2:28:11] you can go over in the bible there's a
[2:28:14] prophetic bar
[2:28:16] from genesis to revelation and when god
[2:28:18] fulfills something the bar comes up
[2:28:21] there's another part there's not
[2:28:22] fulfilled yet the bar comes down
[2:28:24] when it's getting fulfilled the bar
[2:28:26] comes up amen
[2:28:28] jesus could not come out of the grave
[2:28:30] until after three days
[2:28:32] because there was a prophetic bar and
[2:28:33] the scripture says that said he'll be in
[2:28:35] the grave for three days and three
[2:28:36] nights is that right
[2:28:37] he cannot come out to fulfill the next
[2:28:40] part of the scriptures
[2:28:41] because there's a bar there
[2:28:46] but when those days were fulfilled up
[2:28:48] comes the bar
[2:28:49] next comes pentecost
[2:28:52] amen prophetic bar
[2:28:57] now
[2:29:01] and the church ages they were praying
[2:29:04] for rapture
[2:29:08] did you know that they wanted a rapture
[2:29:12] the pentecostals thought this is the
[2:29:14] time of the rapture
[2:29:17] but there's a bar there and i'm wanting
[2:29:20] a rapture wanting a rapture he says
[2:29:22] he can't so there's a bar there because
[2:29:25] there must be a
[2:29:25] former rain come first to bring a
[2:29:29] teaching
[2:29:29] before there can be a letter rain and a
[2:29:32] four marine come together
[2:29:33] to bring a body change and so they are
[2:29:36] thinking
[2:29:37] this is the time of the rapture but the
[2:29:39] bar was still up
[2:29:42] because brother branham hadn't come
[2:29:46] he can't proceed any further
[2:29:47] pentecostals until you
[2:29:50] accept what i put in the scriptures
[2:29:53] they say that they're speaking in
[2:29:55] tongues with this and this and the
[2:29:56] synthesis is trying to bring this
[2:29:57] prophecy to past
[2:29:58] can't there's a bar there
[2:30:02] but when a prophet came and brought a
[2:30:05] former rain
[2:30:08] something started to happen to the bar
[2:30:16] amen it started to come up
[2:30:19] it didn't come up don't come up that way
[2:30:23] you ever seen
[2:30:23] one at the railway station do that it
[2:30:26] doesn't come out it comes out
[2:30:27] gradually now
[2:30:32] they were praying in the church ages for
[2:30:35] things
[2:30:36] that is for our day god said no
[2:30:39] no no no no but they prayed
[2:30:43] and those prayers got held in a certain
[2:30:46] place
[2:30:49] they got held god didn't say
[2:30:53] i don't want to hear those prayers they
[2:30:55] were held in a certain
[2:30:56] place waiting for a bar
[2:31:00] to lift amen
[2:31:03] now watch i'll show you some pictures
[2:31:05] that i put in south africa
[2:31:08] so they could understand oh no
[2:31:11] it's that's not the one right watch now
[2:31:16] there is a bar of prophecy
[2:31:19] if you can get this brethren it's all
[2:31:22] over
[2:31:26] revelations 5 8 the book's not open yet
[2:31:30] it wasn't open to revelations 10.
[2:31:34] and he had taken the book the four
[2:31:35] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[2:31:37] down
[2:31:37] before the lamb having every one of them
[2:31:40] hearts and golden vials full of odors
[2:31:41] which are the prayers
[2:31:44] of saints not all the saints
[2:31:54] then say all the saints said off
[2:31:59] so that means it's waiting for something
[2:32:05] the bar's down waiting for
[2:32:09] the evening time sacrifice
[2:32:12] and evening time sacrifice comes into
[2:32:15] its fullness
[2:32:16] when the lamb the same lamb that i feel
[2:32:18] at calvary
[2:32:19] takes the bulk and then breaks the seals
[2:32:24] over you and then something happens
[2:32:28] to those prayers let's have a look
[2:32:33] now in the bible when you see the word
[2:32:37] incense
[2:32:37] it's always offered up at a certain time
[2:32:40] in revelations 8 which is the seventh
[2:32:42] seal it was the offering up of incense
[2:32:44] time at evening time
[2:32:49] now watch the evening sacrifice arrives
[2:32:52] all your prayers are
[2:32:56] loosed
[2:33:01] and when he opened the seventh seal
[2:33:03] there was silence in heaven for a space
[2:33:04] over half an hour but guess what
[2:33:07] not on the earth
[2:33:10] there was a mighty racket on the earth
[2:33:12] but there's a silence in heaven
[2:33:16] and i saw seven angels which had stood
[2:33:18] before god and to them were given seven
[2:33:20] trumpets and another angel come and
[2:33:21] stood at the altar heavy
[2:33:23] a golden sense and there was given unto
[2:33:25] much incense that he should offer it
[2:33:27] with the prayers of
[2:33:29] all the saints no
[2:33:33] more bar to your prayers
[2:33:37] what you ask for it's the time to
[2:33:39] receive
[2:33:40] at all praise the lord
[2:33:44] no more barriers to your prayers in this
[2:33:47] day
[2:33:48] anyone that your family needs to come
[2:33:50] and there's no barrier
[2:33:51] to anything
[2:33:55] where the word is being interpreted in
[2:33:57] your lives
[2:34:01] praise the lord are you with me
[2:34:04] this is the most amazing time that we
[2:34:06] are in
[2:34:07] we are connected to the evening
[2:34:10] sacrifice
[2:34:11] and god says now speak what you want
[2:34:14] there's no more barriers to that woman
[2:34:17] [Music]
[2:34:18] praise the lord what a time
[2:34:23] amen praise the lord
[2:34:29] this is the time of uniting
[2:34:32] under that revelation
[2:34:35] it's just a just a few more minutes i'm
[2:34:37] actually trying to get
[2:34:39] this through this because as you know
[2:34:42] some of my sermons are 350 to 400 slides
[2:34:44] long
[2:34:46] but i only go for sometimes one or two
[2:34:47] or three slides because
[2:34:49] you just get burnt out i'll tell you
[2:34:50] something you'd be on a pension before
[2:34:51] the service was over
[2:34:54] now the full understanding comes at the
[2:34:56] evening sacrifice
[2:34:58] amen the evening time lamb draws us in
[2:35:02] the consciousness of our place of
[2:35:04] prophecy
[2:35:04] and prophecy it unites us it connects us
[2:35:08] it takes away the fear and it takes away
[2:35:10] the doubts
[2:35:12] praise the lord what's been going on in
[2:35:14] these meetings
[2:35:16] what was that brother the tester brother
[2:35:18] preaching no no no no no
[2:35:20] no it was the angel himself
[2:35:25] amen a visitation from an angel
[2:35:31] you've got to be sensitive to these
[2:35:33] things my friends
[2:35:35] now look at the rapture time the evening
[2:35:38] staff was sacrificed
[2:35:40] and tight was when lazarus now in the in
[2:35:43] john chapter 10 or 11 i think it was
[2:35:44] lazarus had died amen seven church ages
[2:35:49] lazarus was the people in the seven
[2:35:51] church ages that had
[2:35:53] died but there had to be some people
[2:35:55] alive and remaining
[2:35:56] at the end time to come into a unity of
[2:35:58] the revelation
[2:35:59] so that lazarus could come back and be
[2:36:02] united with him with the lord
[2:36:04] is that right praise the lord
[2:36:08] so there were saints that were alive and
[2:36:09] remaining and one was mary and one was
[2:36:11] martha
[2:36:15] and there was one sister she was full on
[2:36:18] man
[2:36:18] another i gotta have dinner man
[2:36:25] but martha went out and jesus was coming
[2:36:28] back
[2:36:30] and she went out to where jesus was
[2:36:33] amen and he was coming to bring a
[2:36:36] resurrection
[2:36:37] but mary was a dilatory she's like you
[2:36:40] know somebody that's just falling asleep
[2:36:41] in church right now
[2:36:44] see i'll tell you something you don't
[2:36:46] sleep in front of me
[2:36:48] mary was dilatory now look turn to john
[2:36:51] chapter 11 verse 20
[2:36:53] you can write these things down verse
[2:36:55] 20. then martha as soon as she heard
[2:36:57] that jesus was
[2:36:59] coming
[2:37:02] is that right went out and met him but
[2:37:06] mary was still in the house
[2:37:07] so she so she met where he was but mary
[2:37:09] mother had to be in a
[2:37:11] union for the resurrection of lazarus
[2:37:15] same voice oh my god
[2:37:18] oh my goodness me you don't know what's
[2:37:20] happening up here
[2:37:22] the same voice in a union
[2:37:26] saying the same thing
[2:37:29] see mama eagle must go out and awaken
[2:37:33] that girl
[2:37:34] to her fulfillment of the prophecy for
[2:37:37] the day
[2:37:38] verse 11. and when she had said so said
[2:37:40] she went out and called for mary a
[2:37:42] sister
[2:37:42] secretly none in public
[2:37:49] amen
[2:37:53] the master cometh and caught us for thee
[2:37:55] and as soon as she heard
[2:37:57] she arose and came unto him
[2:38:02] he was calling for her calm connect the
[2:38:05] bar's been lifted girl
[2:38:10] not where he was but where he is
[2:38:14] he interprets his word by bringing it to
[2:38:16] pass he brings you to pass
[2:38:18] he awakens you making you aware an
[2:38:20] eaglet must have an equal perspective
[2:38:24] praise the lord when an eagle looks at
[2:38:27] something it does not see
[2:38:29] obstacles
[2:38:30] [Applause]
[2:38:32] oh that was that was free
[2:38:38] i said to my sunday school what does the
[2:38:40] stars do they go twinkle twinkle little
[2:38:42] star
[2:38:43] what is making a star twinkle obstacles
[2:38:46] in the atmosphere
[2:38:48] but when an eagle looks it don't see no
[2:38:51] twinkle
[2:38:53] it sees the star in its purity
[2:38:56] because an eagle can sort out the
[2:38:58] obstacles when it looks at something
[2:39:01] but some eagles are down here moping
[2:39:03] down
[2:39:04] and another eagle must come down with
[2:39:07] some food
[2:39:08] to the moping eagle to say come on feed
[2:39:10] on this and get back up here
[2:39:13] amen this is not the time for moping
[2:39:17] eagles
[2:39:18] you are a people of prophecy you're the
[2:39:21] most important people on this earth
[2:39:23] the bar's been lifted
[2:39:27] the deepest calling to the deep
[2:39:30] praise the lord
[2:39:33] what a glorious time forget about your
[2:39:36] book of life
[2:39:38] this is only the thing i'll meet you in
[2:39:40] the secret place
[2:39:42] of revelation and david he said i'll
[2:39:45] make a tent
[2:39:46] for the ark i'll make it
[2:39:51] and a myself was starting and that
[2:39:54] secret place
[2:39:55] is that right praise the lord amen
[2:39:59] we'll end up on this
[2:40:02] what is it let's turn to um acts chapter
[2:40:07] three let me finish up on this
[2:40:11] oh my goodness oh lord bring me a new
[2:40:15] body
[2:40:18] quick
[2:40:22] now jesus don't put something in the
[2:40:23] bible just say oh i've got a space here
[2:40:25] i'll put some names in it
[2:40:28] you don't do that he had a space filler
[2:40:31] when god writes something he's of few
[2:40:33] words
[2:40:34] you need to be in the love letter to see
[2:40:36] what he's saying so god brings down
[2:40:39] the holy ghost divine love you fall in
[2:40:41] love say oh well that's what that means
[2:40:45] yeah look
[2:40:50] now watch this
[2:40:54] moses was commanded
[2:40:58] to make an image of a temple
[2:41:02] of out of the sorry to make a temple out
[2:41:04] of the vision he saw in heaven is that
[2:41:06] right
[2:41:08] so moses got a holy advent
[2:41:11] would be bazool to do the work according
[2:41:14] to
[2:41:15] moses vision so that moses saw it
[2:41:19] spoke it out these fellows built this
[2:41:21] tabernacle in the wilderness
[2:41:23] but the tabernacle in the wilderness was
[2:41:25] something had to be moved constantly
[2:41:29] but after a period of time
[2:41:33] david wants to go and build the
[2:41:34] tabernacle but god says no you've shed a
[2:41:36] lot of blood but you can get all the
[2:41:38] cedar woods and everything and
[2:41:39] everything are ready to make this temple
[2:41:40] but you ain't gonna do nothing because
[2:41:42] you said
[2:41:42] you've actually uh we need a man of
[2:41:44] peace here
[2:41:46] amen amount of peace
[2:41:49] so solomon comes along and solomon
[2:41:51] builds the temple
[2:41:53] where does he build it on the exact
[2:41:56] same location where jesus was crucified
[2:42:01] is that right so a temple of god
[2:42:05] must be connected to where the blood
[2:42:08] sacrifice was and has come from
[2:42:12] is that right now apostle paul comes
[2:42:14] along later after
[2:42:16] acts chapter 9 and he's the messenger of
[2:42:18] the age and he starts preaching about
[2:42:20] the tabernacle of god as with i should
[2:42:22] say that we are the temple of god
[2:42:25] now paul's laying it out but peter
[2:42:27] already had an understanding of it
[2:42:31] because in his life he was expressing it
[2:42:33] now watch
[2:42:36] this temple now peter and john went up
[2:42:38] together into the temple
[2:42:41] why did he say peter and john
[2:42:44] peter was the feast of pentecost john
[2:42:47] was the feast of tabernacles
[2:42:51] you're john
[2:42:54] peter was a spokesman for the feast of
[2:42:57] uh pentecost john was the one on the
[2:43:00] isle of patmos who got caught up into
[2:43:02] the lord's day
[2:43:05] and saw himself in theophany form in
[2:43:07] revelation chapter four
[2:43:09] are you with me now and this is put into
[2:43:12] the book of acts and he said well write
[2:43:14] another book of acts
[2:43:16] the same book of acts but brought back
[2:43:18] into its fullness time again
[2:43:22] now a dispensation has changed from
[2:43:25] judaism into christianity is that right
[2:43:27] the veil was read from top to bottom at
[2:43:30] passover
[2:43:31] and at just that cut the time of the
[2:43:34] jews was
[2:43:34] finished but there was an overlap
[2:43:38] time before titus came in and wiped the
[2:43:41] whole thing out
[2:43:42] where we are in an overlap time now my
[2:43:44] friends
[2:43:47] oh my we're in overlap time
[2:43:50] i tell you something we are in a real
[2:43:54] overlap time
[2:43:58] so i believe that the lord's cautioning
[2:44:00] me to tell you that
[2:44:02] it is later than what you think watch
[2:44:05] these people
[2:44:08] went up to the temple at the hour of
[2:44:10] prayer being the
[2:44:11] ninth hour just another just five
[2:44:14] minutes that's it
[2:44:17] that's it and a certain lame man from
[2:44:21] his mother's womb was carried whom they
[2:44:22] lay daily at the gate of the temple
[2:44:24] which is called beautiful to us
[2:44:25] arms of them that entered into the
[2:44:27] temple
[2:44:30] here is at the temple now when jesus
[2:44:33] went to calvary says the before he went
[2:44:35] he said destroy this temple or i'll
[2:44:37] raise it up again
[2:44:39] now when the holy ghost fell at
[2:44:41] pentecost what came into existence
[2:44:44] heaps and heaps of tempos
[2:44:52] the mercy seat changed from one man
[2:44:59] to a many member body
[2:45:02] praise the lord now the access
[2:45:06] to salvation came
[2:45:10] by who you connected with
[2:45:17] verse 3 this man
[2:45:20] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[2:45:22] into the temple asked
[2:45:24] on arms and feet of peter facing his
[2:45:26] eyes on him
[2:45:27] but john said look
[2:45:30] on us
[2:45:37] look at us we have the access
[2:45:44] to salvation
[2:45:48] who are you the access
[2:45:53] to people where's the mercy seat
[2:45:58] may the mercy seat stand up
[2:46:06] praise the lord
[2:46:11] musicians please those mercy seats
[2:46:16] need to speak with one voice
[2:46:22] united at the time of the evening
[2:46:25] sacrifice
[2:46:29] we have arrived
[2:46:37] you're going to go out of this place
[2:46:40] and go home
[2:46:44] and i pray this will break
[2:46:47] like a dawning of a new day to you
[2:46:51] the bar my friends has been lifted
[2:47:00] and this little woman goes up
[2:47:05] and she's s is going up to the king and

[2:47:16] fourth seal
[2:47:17] under the fourth seal uh harmon's trying
[2:47:19] to go and destroy what the royal seeds

[2:47:27] and esther
[2:47:30] where's the mercy seat for your loved
[2:47:32] ones
[2:47:33] and you brother
[2:47:37] says i would rather have them respect
[2:47:39] you than respect me
[2:47:41] by talking about i mean the lord said
[2:47:43] that respect his people than respect him
[2:47:46] because when you're respecting his
[2:47:47] people you are respecting him
[2:47:50] you know most people that we'll be
[2:47:52] talking to will be sick of resurrection
[2:47:54] people
[2:47:54] but there needs to be an access point
