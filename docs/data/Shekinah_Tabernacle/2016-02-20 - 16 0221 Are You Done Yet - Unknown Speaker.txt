that we can um just be in your house this morning to um come and hear from you and to worship you and just to acknowledge that you're the God and King Of Our Lives and just to be in an atmosphere where you can touch and mold and make our hearts Lord we know that we can approach you any time lord and yet there's just something about being amongst Saints of like Precious Faith Lord and where the spirit of God is that it it does something for us Lord and in your word you said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together Lord as a manner of summer as even even more as you see the day approaching so Lord we've just gathered ourselves together here this morning we want to humbly invite you into our midst we ask that you'll bless us Lord forgive us for any sins we've committed Lord and help us to um just focus our mind on you this morning that we could um receive from you we know Lord that your desire for us is always good that you always desire to to build us up and and

messing with him and telling him that God wasn't doing much for him and that and he would just start thinking about all the things that God had done and then before he knew it he'll be singing one of them one of them you know that's we we get challenged on these things and we have to have a a personal reality in our own life amen to to know that God's Not Dead that that there's a point where we

God bless you all you can take your seats this morning thanks man good work give him a round of applause good stuff amen Okay so we've um got an item this morning from um brother John and the um Team the music guys have got an ambitious Target an ambitious goal that they're embarking on and they're all on a grant even Brother Andy and he doesn't know what this is yet now he kind of does so so the Lord seems to have been giving us a few a few songs that we've been um writing and then learning and so we did our maths the other week and we figured if we write one song a week then in one year there's 52 songs which is quite a b song book yeah and then we looked around at who we've got and brother John is probably can bear the brunt of that weight so we sort of laid about 20 on his shoulders 22 and maybe I might do 21 and then we figured the rest will split between everyone else Brother Andy Sister Christine you what songs you do now brother ID yeah so they've got to do maybe three in a year which which hey a non-m musician could do that you know you probably all randomly come up with some tune here and there in your life yeah everyone has yeah yeah see hey if you get one you think it's quite nice come and see one of us and say look I've got this tune you never know I'll see you on Monday yeah yeah yeah um and so you'll have to be with us because we'll have to bring them into the congregation as they come out and um we think that maybe we might do each new song as an item and then the following week we will sing that song and we want to do it maybe two or three times just to get people used to the song if it doesn't work we won't do it again some songs may be not very good and we just won't do them again but we'll see how we go um but this song um John's going to sing a song that he wrote the other day I just want to show you something I got the picture sometimes when you it's not this song Brother Andy it's another one sometimes when you know where a song came from there's a bit more appreciation for the song how it came about um on the desktop there andy there's a um it's just oh know I've got it already open it's a photo already open on the just look down the bottom on the taskbar there's a there's a photo open if you could just bring that across here I want to show you this cuz I think this is quite um the check yep yeah this is yeah can you

on the 6th of March I'd like to have an evening service with communion foot washing cuz it's been about 3 months since we've had it so amen so and then also uh next Sunday uh brother Freddy Esau asked me to preach there in Oakland so please if you pray for that that'd be really appreciated too amen his power in prayer amen if you've got your Bibles handy we'll just go to uh First Kings chapter 18 and then I want to read uh John chapter 8 just a a scripture there and then we'll go to Romans chapter 12 just as one more scripture now I want to just we'll just drop into the uh you everyone's familiar with the story of Elijah on Mount carel and I just want to uh take a bit of a a scripture from there so but so we'll just drop into the halfway into the story we'll just go to verse 30 there in uh in First Kings 18 and so so this is after baal's the priest of Baal have tried to do all their calling upon Baal and they've miserably failed and then so and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord which was broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying is shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as could contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood he said do it a second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they said um uh and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the AL Al and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know uh that thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast turned their heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and lick up the water and it was uh uh that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces uh and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God Amen let's go to uh John chapter 8 and uh I just want to read a couple of scriptures here in John chapter 8 just just two uh verses 31 and 32 the many times we misquote this verse in in verse 32 we you know we normally say and the truth shall set you free but that's not what the scripture tells us at all so verse 31 it says here in John chapter 8 then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so there's power in in in in continuing in the word it makes you free there's a there's a law in the in the word it'll make you free you know amen so there's a force in there there's a force in the word that will free the believer amen we'll go to John 12 and verse one and this is probably just want to read this so you know where I'm going uh John chap uh sorry Romans 12:1 and this is Paul now he he says these things I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may be seated so I want to uh I want to just pose you a question are you done yet that's my title are you done yet are you done and um yeah so so this is where I'm going basically so we see here on on Mount carel that uh you know we see that Elijah we read there that that he he repaired the altar of the Lord you he didn't re he didn't build a new altar he repaired one that was already there and he lays the challenge before this and we didn't read it but but if you want to go read the whole chapter of maybe read 17 and 18 of First Kings and so Elijah makes the challenge he says he says to the prophets of Baal he says call unto the name of your gods and I'll call on the name of the Lord and the god that anth by fire let him be God and and all the people answered said it is well spoken so the challenge was the god that answers by fire he is he is the real God right and we see on the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost had fully come and the 120 were in the upper room that was a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind and there was clothing tongues of fire upon each one so the god of the Bible answered by fire and Elijah's day and he answered by fire in the New Testament as well Hallelujah that it was more than just a fire that burned up a sacrifice as a shadow of the Old Testament but it was a life that came into the church amen hallelujah there was a living a living God separated himself into the believer amen so that was the reason why there had to be an answer with fire but we understand that Elijah Elijah as I said he reped the altar of the Lord so it was already there you know the prophets of Baal had their Altar and they were doing all their things and cutting themselves and calling upon God and just getting in the flesh to try and get a response from you know from God and then but El he repaired the altar amen and this is very important because you know he he repaired cuz an altar is a way of sacrifice to God Amen and I'm going to take this a bit slow then maybe we'll you know we'll speed up as we go but I just want you to catch these thoughts because an altar is is is a approach to God because without the shedding of blood there's no Fellowship there's no remission of sin so an altar has to be made blood has to be shed and then the people can approach God and so Elijah repaired the altar of the Lord that had fallen into disrepair so the approach to God had fallen into disrepair amen because Israel they had forsaken the ways of God and they are now following Baal they built another altar but that altar wasn't ordained by God it was ordained by man's devices amen and so Elijah repared it now the spirit of Elijah is always used I'll say this to rebuild the altar of God to rebuild the um correct approach to God okay I'm just going to take this slowly this is not some mental gymnastics but you can see it all the way through the Bible because you see he said there before the fire fell that they may know that you are God and you have turned their hearts back again so the pro the very reason the altar was there and the sacrifice was there and the fire would fall that they would turn back to the right approach to God Amen and then now John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah and he was called to turn the hearts of the of the uh fathers to the children so he was called to turn the people's hearts from serving the law turn their hearts to receive the bridegroom to receive Christ that was that was his ministry to introduce a people to Jesus Christ and so he had to I'd say this he had to build a new altar amen because Jesus says in mark 7:7 it says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men that's right so Jesus was saying these scribes and Pharisees that have the temple that have their their ceremonies that were god-given that had their sacrifices which were god-given that had the law that was god-given but what they had done is they had they had perverted the very approach that God gave them to sacrifice and then now they were teaching they were wor himing God in vain yeah because the approach was now skewed yeah that's right am mean the approach was now wrong yeah are following me so far so and this is why John the Baptist had to come to prepare the people to turn from that Old way into a new way right and then even Jesus says in Matthew 23:13 he says but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in so they had actually by traditions of man they had shut the Kingdom of Heaven to the people and the prophets of Baal they were calling out they were cutting themselves they calling out upon this God but there's no answer there's no answer with fire right there's no actual God speaking back to them saying this is me this is my provided way right and that's why Elijah had to come and rebuild the altar that the correct worship could be could be done amen now Stones because I'm going to bring this into it today cuz it's all very well back there but what about today remember the question is are you done yet I'm going to get to the you know but are you done amen are you done now the stone stones in the Bible actually speak of spiritual revelation of the word because when Jesus asked his disciples who do men say that I am they said some say you're Jeremiah or John the Baptist one of the prophets and he he asked them but who you say I am what is the Revelation that you say I am and Peter said thou the Christ the son of the Living God and then we and then if you keep reading he says blessed art thou Simon by Jonah Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you you got to read the whole that whole passage of scripture is upon Revelation what is been revealed to them and what's been revealed to you amen amen and the same question is always posed upon every generation who do you say this is who do you say Malachi 4 was was he just a Healing Ministry was he just a different kind of Supernatural Ministry or is this God unveiling himself to the people you have to know it for yourself who do you say it is amen amen because if you recognize this is God then you receive what you need amen because Jesus the woman who touched the Hem of His Garment she knew this was more than a man it was revealed this is more than a man if I could just Touch the Hem of a garment I'll be made well I'll be made whole amen so you got to it's got to be revealed to you who do you say this is right amen well my daddy says this my my spouse says this maybe my brother or sister says this but who do you say it is right who do you say it is you must know for yourself amen sir and so and then he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and that's the revelation of who he is not who he was but who he is yes amen cuz he's a present God he's not a historical God that's right you if we could just that such a small phrase Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever am and sometimes we can just speak it out without even it becomes a catchphrase right but if he is the same he does the same things he transforms people the same way that same life that came into the upper room can come into you amen that same go can live in you Hallelujah that same God can speak to you the same God that speak to Abraham can come and speak to you amen yes Hallelujah amen so so Stones a spiritual revelation of the word and so now what happens is because remember there was all these years of denominationalism and they you know some said he's three some said he's two some says he's one some say he's coming on a horse and on a cloud and they made their different denominations and this is how you baptize and so I'll say this there was a lot of altars that people have built up in sincerity they built them the prophets of Baal were sincere I believe that's right amen but they are sincerely wrong there's been a lot of altars being built as an approach to God but now God sent the spirit of Elijah and a prophet to rebuild to rebuild the correct approach to God amen amen amen because if you believe a lie if you're putting your faith in a lie you're putting your faith in the wrong thing right so it has to be revealed this is the way if Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life then he's obligated to reveal the way he's obligated to reveal the truth amen amen If people really want to meet God he'll come their way but then now it's up to you to respond the correct way amen so now he so so Elijah built the Altar and as I said spiritual revelation of the word of stones so now as the word is preached or as you as you read the Bible you listen to the message Revelation begins to drop into every heart amen right ation anchors into every soul I trust you can say I have some stones in my heart that that nothing can be they cannot be taken from me people may try and argue out of it or in it but something anchors you can't deny it as you can deny yourself so now Stone so Stone upon stone is built amen Into the Heart of the believer yes sir and so here's a few Stones now I'm not saying you all you have to I'm not saying you have to have all these stones to build the altar but here's just some examples we're in the end time amen amen I trust that's a revelation to you we're living in the Rapture cycle we're living in the resurrection Hallelujah and I trust as anch it in your in your soul you are the resurrection am mean if Jesus said I'm the resurrection and the life and that same life comes into you you can say I am the resurrection and the life because his life is in you amen is that too strong I don't think that's too strong amen God sent Malachi 4 I trust that a and he turned my heart back again Hallelujah God is real and and he is the Lord Jesus Christ I trust that's anchored into your heart he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah amen he died on the cross for me amen I am I am sinless and perfect as he is sinless and perfect amen amen he became me that I might become him by Grace Hallelujah he without amen what are we amen so I trust you I've been baptized in the name of the Lord I've repented been baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I trust that's anchored into your heart so those are stones but now that's not the end of the you have an altar but now that's not the end of the story right now we read there in Romans chapter 12 present your body a Living Sacrifice so now there's the altars built amen and the wood is there but now you have to climb up onto your altar amen amen men you have to lay your you have to become the sacrifice you following me because it's not just enough to say well God's revealed these things now you've got to respond to the revealing now you've got to lay your body upon the altar yes sir amen now you've got to become the sacrifice that's how that's how people respond amen when they hear the word it doesn't matter if there just one service they've been in I in paping you get Catholic people come into the services after one service they give their heart to Christ they get baptized they say I don't want to go of tribulation what something's anchored in their heart amen hallelujah and then they present themselves amen you have to you have to put yourself upon the altar amen amen see if you haven't done that see you have to response as I said God can place all these things reveal all these things but then now you have to respond to the call amen see people see a sacrifice as we as we read the fire fell and it consumed every part of the it consumed the altar it consumed the water it consumed the wood and it consume the sacrifice it just licked it all up Hallelujah and then when you lay yourself you know people who are still wrestling are still alive that's right I'll put it that way it's just in my notes people who are wrestling are still alive I say this don't be afraid to let go and let God have his way see people are scared they say well I I I'm scared I you I don't want to give these things up don't look at what you have to give up look at what you've got to gain Hallelujah if God is the same yesterday today and forever and you can read in the book of Acts isn't that wonderful amen and you go into the old T see what God it isn't that wonderful but God doesn't just want you to look at the Bible and say isn't that wonderful he wants that same one to come and live in you the same one to reveal himself to you Hallelujah that's what he wants so don't be afraid you know oh what do you have to gain eternal life to be Victor glorious in every part of your life to walk out of this world undefeated as brother John son Hallelujah so don't be afraid to let go and let God have his wayu amen don't be afraid that's right you see people people who get a bit religious uh when they know they should die on The Altar see conviction comes down and then people get religious and then they say now I need to do something and actually think of doing works for God you take the woman at the well you know Jesus at the well she's got her water pot and he says you know woman bring me a drink it says and then she says to him well you got nothing to draw with and he said well if you know the water I had you know it gives you eternal life and all these things and she said give me of this water and then she gets religious Our Father Jacob dug this well and then they say you should you know and our fathers worshiped in this mountain but you say you should Worship in Jerusalem she got religious but then that wasn't the end of it for her she had to drop her old life she had to drop her she she left her water pot the scripture tell and then she ran into the city amen amen so she had to drop her old life she would have done that every day gone to get water amen and so instead of you and then people come under conviction I need to witness I need to do all these things no you just got to get upon the altar amen you just got to be burned and consumed that a new life comes into you amen we don't want to we don't want to just get religious get a get a message religion but God has to come and consume the sacrifice now this isn't how can I overcome good question is it how can I overcome because to he he that overcomes I'll he'll sit in my Throne as I've sat down on my father's Throne that Throne is a Dominion amen so so so I just love it how you know you normally ask the question how can I overcome and then brother Brown preach a sermon how can I overcome he says there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time lot's time and now this time there is an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither is it are good works that you do it's one Spirit Romans 8:11 we are all baptized into one body in the Dominion of that Kingdom one spiritual pardon me baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome it's all it's all that is under the shed blood as Overcomers cuz you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you're resting How will I know then brother Bram that I'm in there watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull then see you're then you're doing it but don't try to do it did you ever try yeah don't this is where I got my title are you done yet have you given up have you given have you just given you surren you know have you just surrendered have you given it up and not in here but really given up amen because when you give up the fire falls amen don't just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he just up down over everything else see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is up down and around it takes your Steady Hand that's right oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to Father say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the cat on me I quit trying just let him do it see if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it and he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord here I am uh just let me be nothing I yield put my hand in the right you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself yes your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't that's right amen that's right but then but then people who get all kind of religious they want to try and put their hand in the coat I want to try and do something you know all you have to do is die amen and really be dead that's all you need to do amen you just got to yield yourself now people have such a I I'll just put it out this way if people have never experienced the power of God they say it's not for them amen maybe that's a bit strong but you know people you know people have an idea well we're in the message now in the days of the power of God a past cuz we're in a different age but God doesn't take away he adds that's right it's everything he does in former ages he still does he adds to amen so people people say that God now I just had this list now people people say God doesn't deliver and said the person who's never been delivered amen God doesn't set people free by his word said the person who's never been set free but it says in the Psalms he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions Hallelujah cuz people just say I've got to basically live with my problems you don't have to live with no problems amen whom the son has set free is free indeed he says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them and he sent his word into this age not for you just to live with things and wrestle with things but for you to die on The Altar and be set free amen amen as we as we read there and you shall then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth is going to make you free now to continue is to stay this is the Greek the meaning it's a verb is it it's to stay it's to abide to dwell to endure to be present remain to stand amen so if you continue in the word doesn't matter what you I said last Sunday about Elijah standing flat foot on the trial but he ran from Jezebel but he didn't it didn't waver his faith in God that's right amen amen so he stood flat footed in his faith even though he ran he say well that doesn't sound like no cuz he never became a believer of Baal that's right amen he still stood on the word of God that's right amen and so you may have to do things like he did run but as long as your faith doesn't waver amen amen as long as your faith his faith never wavered he knew who he was he knew who God was he didn't begin to believe a lie and so we have to stay to remain in the word it means as I said it means to endure amen who's ured amen amen we have to you know there's going to be Overcomers on that day it's all Overcomers walking into heaven and so we have to overcome we have to wrestle we have to overcome there's a victory that God wants to see in your life amen amen amen he doesn't just push a button and say there's the Rapture you've got to fight every inch amen amen but G is in you that is in the world just need the Holy Ghost and you'll overcome amen people try and work it out in their mind forget working it out in your mind well this is how we be Christians forget it say God consume me change my thinking to match your thinking that's all you need you got got to let go are you done see people wrestling you see a Living Sacrifice you know are you done just give up have you really given up are you done cuz if you're done you can't be consumed amen the fire can't fall if you're still wrestling just give up amen just give up that's all you need to do now this shall make you free it means to liberate Amen to deliver to make free so so the truth if you continue in his word the truth shall make you free amen so there's power and just abiding in the truth there's a force in the word amen that will make you free Jesus just say things he said You shall know the truth we have the Vindicated truth of the hour amen we have the we have thus sayi the Lord on this word so we know the truth not we shall maybe one day where it is you know the truth therefore the truth shall make you freej if you're bound just recognize devil I know the truth hallelujah and the truth said it will make me free because the truth is not a collection of of facts or phrases or IDE years or a school of thought the truth is a person the truth is Jesus Christ am and he is the word amen so when it says and the truth shall make you free it's actually saying I'm going to come and make you free amen that's amen the truth I myself are going to make you free yeah Hallelujah the truth is a person so you know and then some people say you know it's okay to live with the devil said the person who's got being gotten used to being a slave amen don't be a slave thank you don't be a slave do not get used to living a half-cooked Christianity life amen if he said You shall know the truth the truth shall make you free I just hinged my whole soul on that verse I know the truth see if you're bound you don't have to stay bound I just I was just thinking let's break this glass ceiling amen amen the devil loves to try and put a a a thing over us a lid I say reject the lid hallelujah what are we afraid what are you afraid of oh I'll lose control what do my neighbor think hey if you stand up and scream and shout if they have God in them they'll look at you and say I wish I had that Victory Amen brother brah saw a woman D you know screaming and shouting in the church and she and he thought if I just had half the victory that sister had yes hallelujah what could happen that's right amen don't be afraid are you done amen are you done God's spirit doesn't move and that was for another age said the person that has never experienced it remember he's the same yesterday today and forever you know Camp I expected Camp to be like Camp amen cuz we had Camp last year and God did what he did at Camp last year did the same thing I wasn't surprised I was expecting it but if no one has ever carried in the service or expected God to come down well then they'll just walk out and go home yeah cuz I think oh that good preaching and then I just go home it's more than that amen amen you can I'll you know I'll find the I'll find the I'll find the quote this is in questions and answers he says this this is the question dear brother Bram do you believe that signs should follow all who have the Holy Spirit Jesus said so Mark 16 if so what about the people who believe the message with all that is in them yet they have not these signs are they unbelievers or do they need the Holy Ghost if so please instruct us today how to receive the Holy Ghost we believe your God's mouthpiece for our day your brother remember these signs following them the believe they just follow your life you don't have to try and generate anything it just follows your life that's what it means by these signs shall follow so you don't have to have a checklist and say well have I raised the dead if I cast out Devils have I spoken just walk with God and if he's in you these signs will follow amen amen lay upon the sick they shall recover amen y I mean just just walk with God but he says this thank you my brother for regarding me as your brother and I think that's a very good question friends yes it's a little slack I'd like to deal a bit longer on it if I could see some of you see when you cannot receive remember some of you see when you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens now if you believe every spec of the word you say you uh so you say you believe every spec of it then the word is laying there waiting for the Holy Spirit to put it to work but it takes the lighting of the candle here's the candle with the wick in it and with all the Tallow and everything in it has to um uh it has to have in that candle but until the fire comes on it it will not shine any light no matter how perfect the candle is and how perfect it'll burn burn and everything it's got to be Litt and then it burns and when you believe and are made and are made up of the instructions of the holy spirit is Joy love peace long suffering goodness the fruits that it Bears out until the holy spirit with a fire experience comes down and lights that candle then you haven't received the Holy Ghost SE you've got to have the experience to have the Holy Ghost well do I look for some big experience no I just say put yourself on the altar amen cuz if you're totally dead on the altar then the fire comes down because people and and and I've seen it around people look for an experience but the experience is never big enough to what they think it is so they go seeking for something bigger and bigger and there's no stability in their walk right but then they forget just just just are you done yet are you dead upon the altar yet if you're dead upon the altar then God all has to come down and consume the sacrifice amen but he's saying that the candle has to be lit it's not some gradual thing the candle's got to be lit somewhere you got to look back in your life and say something happened to me I can maybe not put my finger on the exact moment but my life is very different from then to now what's happened the candle got lit amen amen and you'll know when the candle's lit hallelujah amen so we have to the fire's got to come down and consume we how do you how do you know I've got it the fire has to come down and consume your old Nature's and desire amen your old life has to be dead it has to be consumed out the things you once did you don't do again the things you once love you hate the things you used to hate you now love right amen that's when you know a nature because you know people can have a great Supernatural experience but unless their old Nature's burned out right then they can go back into the world I mean they can go back and do other things but if the desire is dead that's why you know a sacrifice on an altar if it's burnt up and consumed it's not a it's not its old form anymore it's turned into ashes and carried away amen amen the fire burns up the sacrifice and so the fire of God has to change your nature amen well I'm afraid of this and this I don't want to be a peculiar you know the scripture says we're A peculiar people amen a royal priesthood a holy nation you can't help being you can't walk with God and with the world amen amen what do you have to gain oh my friends will leave me but heaven will receive me amen which would you rather have all right oh but they'll call me some oldfashioned something I'd rather be have oldtime religion amen and and then have the spirit of compromise amen hallelujah so so your Nature's got to be changed that's how you know you're different cuz your desires you're you got a totally new desire in you that's why brother B says I smoke all I want and I'll just put my me in there I smoke all I want I drink all I want I run around party all I want amen I wear all the shorts I want I go to the movies all I want I do but there's nothing in me to want those things so I don't do it why cuz my Nature's been burned out amen so if there's something in you doesn't physically want those things even though sin we know sin is enticing that's why people fall for it CU it's enticing but if there's a nature in here that doesn't want that thing that's a whole different thing amen hallelujah amen so the fire's got to come down and consume your old nature and desires that's why we can Rejoice if your Nature's been changed you say what did that Christ Hallelujah he came in amen I now have a different life Hallelujah now brother bam talks about this in the sermon a hidden life I know it's brother Andy's probably favorite sermon and so he speaks about the Tabernacle you know there's the three there's the outer Court the inner court and there's the holy of holies and that is our Christian Journey from the outer Court you come in with the sacrifice and you go into the inner Court then you go into the very presence of God and the life the life you're are living now actually reveals where you are in that process amen well you say well I believe the word brother B you know you know he says in the token he says but I believe everything you say brother bar he says that's good but that's just being able to read amen that's just being but it says you have must receive the life amen the fire's got to fall on the sacrifice it can't just lay there no matter how perfectly arranged the fire's got to fall amen amen he says sure they eat man are out there so speak about the inner Court I mean sorry outside but they don't know about this they've never been in there speaking of the presence of God have you my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but I want to ask you something Have you ever come to the place in your life where Christ meant more to you so he's actually showing this is actually what qualifies us now because you say well I'm you know I'm in the inner Veil where the glories never fail well how does that actually that can just be a word that can just be a phrase I'm living in the prin of the king how's that lived out amen cuz these these things are not just are fairy Pie in the Sky amen these are these are real things Hallelujah and so have you ever come to a place in life where Christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church has Christ uh has Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotion or mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something set settled in there that something's taking place that you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ amen is that now your whole you don't care what the world says about you don't care about what your family says about you you don't care about you don't try and please anyone that's right you only want to please him amen have you come to that place well what will so and so think of me who cares about so and so amen doesn't matter how what kind of influence they have in your life how good that person may be you want what does Jesus think of me amen amen what does what does the very God Of Heaven think of me have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and out um not to go out and act smart but till the love of God Is So anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from somewhere what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where you got to come to my brethren that's the place where God Reveals His secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling you get what I mean have you come to that place well I can understand what the message says and everything but have you come to to that place God is not going to Rapture PowerPoints he's not going to Rapture Bibles he's not rapturing all the message books are staying here he's going to Rapture people where the Living God is in them those are the only things going in the Rapture amen have you come to that place where God means everything to you amen amen more than who cares what other people say have you come to that place I don't you I don't serve God because there's church here I don't serve God because of my wife I don't serve God because of my parents or my family I serve God cuz I met him amen amen he became he spoke to me I spoke back to him I mean he became real to me that's why I served God why cuz I came into that how did I get to that hidden place I died I laid upon I was hearing the message Stones were being placed and I laid upon that altar in my room and I didn't get up Hallelujah the old man was consumed amen oh he doesn't do that anymore I'm sorry but I've had the experience yes amen God changes people like that if you'll let them that's right you don't have to go through some self-help program he sent his word and it healed them and delivered them from their destruction well yet Peter spake these words of what the resurrection Jesus being the same yesterday today and forever God is here as the what as he spake these words what happened the Holy Ghost fell oh but he doesn't do that anymore I'm sorry but he does I've been in meeting and see the Holy Ghost fall upon people while preaching's happening amen the same God does the same things Hallelujah he's the same one but then if we sit back and we're reserved about these things if you hold if you try and hold back you got to let go that's right right amen just just let God and let him have his way amen but I'm worried what people will think don't worry what people will think what is there's holding power in the word of God that's right amen how do you you know Cain asked God am I My Brother's Keeper and he was his brother's keeper well how do you keep your brother how do you keep your family it's not by just trying to please them amen if you stand upon the word in love amen if you make a clear-cut decision say God I'm serving you it doesn't matter what happens amen then there's keeping power that God can use you and get your family amen amen but if you compromise and do all these things you say Lord get a hold of my family he's going to get a hold of you first that's right amen because God you say God speak to my family he saying I need to use you that's right amen he is waiting you say Lord open the heavens and speak to them and God's saying get on the altar that's right amen be consumed and then I'll use you to reach your family I'll use you to reach your people you're burden for amen hallelujah God must have skin on friends that's not too radical I don't think he he was a god with skin on and Jesus and the prophets and the apostles and all the Believers down through God had skin on them amen hallelujah and it's the same today as it was back then so what are you going to are you done yet well I'm saved I said are you done yet amen remember a Living Sacrifice don't get off the altar amen you got to be on there and let the Fire Fall you got to open your heart and just let them do it well I have all these things hey look Caleb and Joshua they had a lot of problems they had Giants they had cities they had whole nations against them in the promised land what did they do did they now did they PL did they stand in the wilderness and train the Army amen did they did they build Siege equipment to take Jericho what did they do they had faith in the word that was given them that's how they took Jericho that's how they took the promised land because God had given them the land amen Paul poses this question to the Galatians he says this only what I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith oh ye so foolish are you so foolish having begun in the spirit that ye are now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he that ministereth to you the the spirit and worketh miracles among you that he do it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith so he's actually asking them how's this all happening is it just by The Works of the law or is it by the hearing of faith and he's actually telling them it's not by The Works of the law but it's by the hearing of Faith so Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen and so when and so that's in Galatians 3 2:5 and so now there's a law it said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so there's a law of Faith now that when the word comes into someone's heart they believe it then that word will have an outworking in their life amen amen and that word will give them overcoming power over everything amen that's a that is thew to me that's the law of Faith amen someone someone speaks it the person believes it then it's lived out amen Caleb and Joshua they heard the word they received it into their souls and they said I believe it they responded amen and then they took the land Hallelujah that was that was how they took the land and we're the same as they were we must take the land we must take our inheritance am Hallelujah we must press it and take it you say well God doesn't supernaturally deliver anymore I'm sorry but he does I used to be bound down with all kinds of things and it was the end of a tape and a woman was crying weeping and then and then brother R says don't you remember when you first met the Lord and it just broke just like that amen amen just like that I didn't need a self-help book I didn't need to work through things I just believe the word hey I believe in counseling there's all there's all that is part of it too but God delivers these ways as well right you know he says about he was I think it was um I think it's in the start of the service he's talking about how he he he had some private interviews which is counseling amen with some couples but he said but he but but he said but now then then God came down when they talking and delivered the people so I said it takes that it takes it touch of God to do what he needs to do so it's not just the talking or hearing the word it takes God to drop it into your soul amen and and and change the person you know I just heard uh sister Ruth's mom Kate was here at Camp you know Bruce and Kate moer at Camp she had a problem with her knee and and and if I get this wrong just um yeah but so she had so she would have a normal day but then when she laid down at night her one of her knees was really painful and then at camp at the end of one of the services she's just singing I think there was a call for prayer one meeting but she didn't go up but then then after that meeting I can't remember what day that was but but one of the services after that she's at the end of the service just just singing and praising God Amen and she feel something just do something in her knee no more pain am amen no more pain whatsoever thank you Lord oh God doesn't heal that way I'm sorry you can't tell her that hallelujah hallelujah why cuz he's in the presence of God the Supernatural is happening amen amen amen hallelujah people are scared Don't Be Afraid as I said do not be afraid to let go and let God have his way don't be afraid to take God at his word doesn't matter how young or old you are don't be afraid to take God at his word amen people are scared you know the Devil comes to kids and they say basically to the kids the devil says to Children this is Mommy and Daddy's religion you're too young this is not for you that's right that's a lie that's a lie from the pit of Hell God is is real to old and young there's no young people in this church we're all young people amen we're all 18 to 21 in our glorified bodies we're all young people amen hallelujah so never look at the young people say Lord touch the young people say God we all young people touch all of us amen because they must see God is real amen that this is not theology we are not message Baptists what does that mean a Baptist just says I believe there's no change in the life that's right Apollos was a Baptist yeah you know brother Braham takes Acts end of Acts 18:19 where where where Paul meets Apollos and some disciples and Apollos only knew the baptism of John but he preached from the scripture that Jesus was the Christ you go away and read it and brother says he was a Baptist they were a group of Baptists they were baptizing but they knew nothing of the power of God coming amen we are not that way we are not message Baptists where they just confess it they say when you believe you receive it but they never received it they just say they believe so they just confess it but there's no change there's no proof amen that God is really there we're not that way we're not a bunch of confessors which are you know without The Possession amen we have what we need amen hallelujah the bride you know Jesus says in as in John 8 just before he said You shall know the truth the truth shall make you free he says he says I am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me then they said unto them where is thy father Jesus answered you neither know me nor my father for if you had known me you should have known my father also so Jesus was saying I bear witness of myself but the father also beareth witness that I say is true and what is that he said it's not me that doeth the works the Supernatural is the father dwelleth in me that doeth the works so Jesus spoke it and then God I say the father supernaturally Vindicated what he was saying amen so there was a Vindication there something came in behind him just like the prophets Elijah any man could have stood up and said let's build an altar and the god that answers by fire let him come but then it was very different when he stood up and said it cuz now that God that he was representing came in behind and backed up what he said amen hallelujah and it must be the same thing for you friends God has to come and back up what you say back up your life supernaturally amen amen hey if God you say oh brother Bam's V deicated what about you amen if you say God is alive well he should be alive in your life as I said these signs shall follow them that believe so just walk with God and as you walk with God he do things like what well I prayed for Johnny or some you know one of my children they got well I I was going through a real crisis and he came upon the scene amen amen amen things it looked like life was falling apart but he kept us together Hallelujah I prayed for this and then he came upon the scene and answered my prayer amen amen amen that is what God coming in behind amen now remember God can still answer prayer even if you're an unbeliever but God answers the prayers of the right you're following me is this all right amen so God there has to be a Vindication y amen if if brother Braham and and it wasn't him saying it people get this all mixed up he says at the end of his ministry I'll ride this Trail again so he's basically saying I'm going to have another ministry again and some people take that they think he's going to do it himself yeah but it's actually God speaking in first person through a man saying the same Ministry is going to be lived out the same Trail is going to be rid right remember David said said in the Psalms my God my God why has Thou forsaken me it wasn't he wasn't forsaken he was looking at Calvary but it was God speaking first person through a man amen I trust trust it doesn't stumble you when a pro would stand up and say I'll ride this Trail again it's not himself speaking it it's the Holy Ghost saying I'm going to do these same things and well the brother braham's not coming back he's only coming back when the dead in Christ rise but then it's all done that's right so how is God going to write a TR again through the bride of Christ amen that the ministry of the bride of Christ is going to be supernaturally Vindicated hallelujah amen and that's just not the fivefold ministry that's every member every member's got a Ministry hallelujah amen so don't you know you stand upon the word then God is obligated to back you up that's like you know you I told the testimony before where I think it uh you know we had that worship service at brother Andy's those years ago and there there was a woman there and we got talking about about woman preachers and so on and then she comes so so I'm uh and then so I said oh I'd like to hear your testimony thing so she had it written down and then while I'm at work she goes to see Christine at our house and she thinks here's this little timid little girl I'm just going to take the Bible and smash you to pieces basically and then Christine begins to share the testimony why she doesn't cut her hair I mean how the Lord delivered her from the drunk guy with the knife you know the crazy man with the knife and then delivered her from the men and the dogs in the park when she's walking along Hallelujah and then you you know why she doesn't cut her hair why she wears dresses all these things and the spirit of God dropped down into the house and she fled from the house without her bag amen you ask her what is that I don't just bear witness of myself but my father Bears witness that this is the truth amen hallelujah Hallelujah so it's more than just well this is Bible Doctrine it goes beyond that goes beyond this is the truth just say but God comes in behind and says yes this is me hallelujah hallelujah what about you you know if you haven't seen we watched it on Wednesday and it still branded into my heart Amen brother kidro digs you go go to Clover at our website watch the Winter Camp the whole thing amen he preaches a sermon he says why not you why not now amen he says why not me why not not now amen and he's talking about Gideon and all these different ones where they basically came into a season and they said why not me why not now Hallelujah why not God use me and why not now why not God deliver me why not now Hallelujah why not yeah I'm on the altar why not me why not now God you go you go listen to that service amen and let it change just that phrase why not you well we're comfortable in our message religion why not me why not now amen we get comfortable in our world we come to church and we read the Bible we listen to tapes and all those things are good we must do those things but you we got to go beyond amen we got to go beyond just just just just a a form or just the mechanics amen having the car brother BR it's in the rising of the sun he says you can have I think it's two Cadillacs and they can he says they're basically just all pimped out or really nice I don't know bit of word for it and he says they can have all the best fuel in the tank they can have everything right but if one doesn't have a spark plug that spark plug is that that car's going nowhere he says we can have all the mechanics just right but if there's not a spark to fire the engine and make it go down the road that's right amen because there's always a dispute he says I think yeah I might be wrong but if you go listen he says it's like you can you like there's a dispute of what's in the engine you know what's in the tank it could be water it could be diesel it could be whatever fuel but it takes the sparking hallelujah amen of the spark plug to really prove what's in the engine and what's in the tank amen amen amen amen am well I want to why not you why not now amen and I ask the question are you done yet amen have you laid have you laid yourself upon the altar amen well I'm trying trying so hard I really want to please him just die you have to be willing to unless you're willing to forsake all now all encompasses a lot of things my family my social standing how people think of me which encompasses your dress what you do how you act all all unless you're willing to forsake all you cannot be my disciple and then if you but well you say well I don't know if I can give it up just continue in the word and if you continue in my word then you're my disciple indeed and you shall know the truth and what the truth shall make you free make not just s it'll make you free even against your will it'll take you amen cuz it's a make I'm going to you know have you ever it's like your children you make them do things pick that up put it there Rush your teeth amen I don't I'm always going to bed one of them tells me all the I'm always going to bed bed honey it's time for bed you basically have to make them go to bed amen what is that I'm making you go to bed amen and human nature nothing wants to die nothing wants to give up because man look at this this building is man's achievement amen this this audio thing that's all man's achievement this Society is man's achievement look what we did look what we have done and people always bring that into the house of God you know into the truth look at what I can do no it's not what you can all you do there's the altar die be consumed are you done amen so why not you why not now you go listen you go listen to that service am and listen to he he's real Dynamic but listen to what he says amen don't stumble over how he says it listen to what he says right because what he says is transform power it's God speaking amen hallelujah that's right so don't don't hold back amen now see I'll find a way to people you know we are called to believe all things are possible amen We Believe to call we are called to believe that in this hour all things are possible so let's let's I think we need to throw out the idea of this is how being in The Message is I'm not talking getting rid of Doctrine and Holiness I'm not talking about that I'm talking about level of expectation why was camp Camp because we had an expectation amen amen what if we had that expectation every day amen amen hallelujah amen have you ever seen a who loves to fish if they don't catch something they don't throw their hands up in Despair and they quit fishing right they have a greater expectation oh next time and then they tell the stories of what they saw and it always gets bigger amen hallelujah amen how much more now I'm talking about eternal things now oh God just doesn't take control of services he doesn't do these things how do you know amen amen but are you done amen I'm just going to I'm I'm I'm I'm basically done we have some musicians to come but you know here's the question are you done yet you got to say yes am you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired as he said you have to overcome yourself amen and the only way you can overcome yourself and he says he says another sermon total Deliverance he says it takes a total surrender to get a total Deliverance amen that's the secret it's not you trying to do this it's you just going to lay on the altar amen amen and and let him consume you well God doesn't just change lives like this anymore I'm sorry I've had the experience I've seen it been done amen don't do not settle for less because unfortunately people got in their minds well that's just a Pentecostal thing people delivering people you know God just delivering people like that no it's not that's a message thing that's right that's where the Living God is he just drops down well how do you get there you say Lord what about me Lord change me God transform me I lay myself on the altar amen just mean it you know it doesn't matter if you're shouting crying or you're silent it's what's in your heart that's being expressed as the main thing amen amen just lay it all on the altar amen hallelujah our god delivers amen Our God heals amen that is not Pie in the Sky amen amen I res see I feel sorry for people that that that it gets twisted in their mind I just have to put up with this this is my cross I have to bear no you don't have to put up with the devil's devices that is not the cross you have to bear amen that is not a cross you have to bear that's right so don't put up with his lie well he's just trying to Humble me are you sure are you sure I just have to Paul had a direct answer amen he prayed three times for the Lord to take that thorn of his flesh from him and God said my grace is sufficient for you least I'll be exalted above the Revelation that God gave me but he had a he had a he wasn't just saying well I think this is God and trying to be all spiritual about it he he got a direct answer right you got to make sure if there's something buffering you something that doesn't seem to let go you better be certain that it's either God has actually put this in you for a purpose or it's Satan he won't let you go amen you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it'll make you free hallelujah amen let's just stand Hallelujah just let go and let God you know oh well I don't know what my husband or wife will think or my kids if they they have an ounce of God in them they'll be proud of you amen I'll say praise the Lord that happen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hey you see a bunch of drunk people they don't stay conservative they don't stay quiet they get excited they all become one
