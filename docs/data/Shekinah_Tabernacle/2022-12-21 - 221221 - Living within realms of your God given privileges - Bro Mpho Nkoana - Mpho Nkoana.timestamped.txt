[38:00] because if you are coming to listen to
[38:02] bradampo tonight
[38:04] i want to tell you that you will be
[38:06] disappointed if you have come to listen

[38:10] you you will be let down i mean but
[38:12] tonight
[38:13] me and you have come to listen to our
[38:16] lord our husband our lord jesus christ
[38:20] remember i told you that all of us can
[38:23] sit down and he can use this mic and
[38:26] speak
[38:27] to you
[38:28] and communicate with you he can raise
[38:31] take this chair and talk to you so i am
[38:34] a non-issue here
[38:37] right i'm just like a speaker that we
[38:39] are using that speaker that you you you
[38:42] you you see here
[38:45] it it cannot talk by itself
[38:47] that speaker cannot pronounce anything
[38:50] it only amplifies what that that which
[38:53] goes through the channel which is the
[38:55] mic and then goes through the system and
[38:58] then the brothers put the volume up
[39:00] and then
[39:01] you think the speaker is talking it's
[39:03] not the speaker
[39:05] it is there's a speaker behind the
[39:07] speaker
[39:08] huh there's there's a speaker and
[39:10] there's a speaker
[39:12] so tonight i'm just that speaker dead
[39:15] without the real speaker
[39:17] behind amen
[39:19] so
[39:20] uh i was so blessed by the service
[39:22] sunday my brother ben
[39:24] i was so blessed man i wish i could just
[39:27] cancel and you take or continue
[39:30] because you know that that that that
[39:32] peace that you you spoke about really
[39:34] sits at the core of my heart you know i
[39:37] i don't know if how many of you
[39:39] remembers
[39:40] the same one the little someone we heard
[39:42] some few weeks ago where we spoke about
[39:44] will you marry me
[39:45] and we were trying to talk about that
[39:47] lady and i can see him i spent a
[39:50] considerable amount of time
[39:52] uh thinking about heaven how heaven will
[39:55] look like i spent some time and and i've
[39:57] got different versions you know you know
[39:59] the mind
[40:01] so
[40:02] and tonight we're going to speak about
[40:05] you know
[40:06] living within
[40:08] the realms
[40:09] of your god-given privileges
[40:12] living within the realms of your
[40:15] god-given privileges
[40:17] and and and we want to to identify a few
[40:20] things there is quite a lot it's quite a
[40:22] big salmon but we just want to identify
[40:25] one or two aspects you know that will
[40:27] actually help us because they are at a
[40:30] pivot they are at the center of actually
[40:34] not being out of the border of your
[40:36] privileges amen
[40:38] amen i want to try to speak slow as much
[40:40] as possible i've learned that i speak
[40:43] fast
[40:44] and many people can't hear my ways
[40:46] and and and so i will try to take it
[40:49] slowly
[40:50] and then but tonight is going to be a
[40:52] short salmon it's going to be
[40:53] uh you know you know when we eat then
[40:56] afterwards we have a a dessert or a
[40:58] snack
[41:00] but tonight we're a sharp snack you know
[41:02] a nice one yeah
[41:04] because the food when you approach it it
[41:07] depends on how you approach that food
[41:09] some are saying wow lovely food some
[41:12] says ah no
[41:13] because you didn't approach it right
[41:15] that food is nice
[41:17] just approach it right amen and let's
[41:20] stand and read the word of god
[41:23] yeah i was so blessed by the season the
[41:26] issue of the season you know
[41:28] and it reminded me of that um
[41:31] we're going to read from
[41:33] john chapter 3
[41:36] we'll read from john chapter 3
[41:38] we know the scripture
[41:41] and tonight i'm not going to bring you
[41:44] new things
[41:45] i'm just going to encourage you to
[41:47] motivate you
[41:49] to lift you up
[41:50] and
[41:52] it's like
[41:55] there was a woman in the uk who was very
[41:58] rich
[41:59] and
[42:00] she
[42:02] she she was she was dying and she didn't
[42:05] know what to do with her money
[42:07] so
[42:08] one day she just went to the bank and
[42:10] withdrew her cash
[42:13] she threw her cash
[42:15] and he just walked in town and just
[42:17] throw it to the people
[42:19] give it to the people
[42:21] and she was arrested
[42:23] can you imagine
[42:26] but the issue is not that she was
[42:27] arrested the issue is if you were in
[42:30] that vicinity at that time what were you
[42:33] going to do
[42:37] i'm telling you some of us will come out
[42:39] there bleeding on our hands
[42:42] you know and i was going to look for
[42:44] those specific colors of those notes
[42:46] which colors i wouldn't just pick any
[42:48] i'll pick specific ones
[42:51] so some of us will be pushing and
[42:53] fighting brothers
[42:55] so
[42:56] it is tonight where the lord the word of
[42:58] god is going out
[43:00] huh what are you doing about it
[43:04] imagine that woman just buntles like
[43:06] this you know when money is new yeah
[43:08] this one that is maybe a hundred or a
[43:10] thousand notes but it's just like this
[43:13] with a little rubber band
[43:15] what will you do
[43:18] but what is being given tonight what the
[43:20] lord is giving you tonight is a trillion
[43:23] times more wealth
[43:25] more valuable than what that woman did
[43:28] what are you doing about it are you
[43:30] grabbing
[43:31] ah are you pushing no no this one is
[43:32] mine on your smile what are you doing
[43:35] about it let's read john
[43:36] chapter 3 then we can sit down because
[43:38] we've got a few scriptures to read
[43:41] and
[43:42] the bible says in john chapter 3 verse
[43:44] 16.
[43:49] it says for god so loved the world that
[43:52] he gave his only begotten son
[43:55] for god so loved the world that he gave
[43:57] his only begotten son
[44:00] that whosoever delivered in him should
[44:02] not perish
[44:04] but have everlasting life
[44:07] let's pray together heavenly father we
[44:09] thank you once more

[44:13] eat too much
[44:15] we can sing too much

[46:30] father amen
[46:32] god bless you you may enjoy your seats
[46:34] and uh i said tonight we are going to
[46:36] talk about
[46:37] living within the realms of your
[46:39] god-given privileges
[46:41] living within not without
[46:44] living inside the boundaries of your
[46:47] god-given privileges god-given then you
[46:51] know let's let's just unpack that weight
[46:53] privilege
[46:55] can we unpack that with privilege then
[46:57] we can we can we can
[47:00] read other scriptures like matthew i
[47:02] will read three more scriptures
[47:04] a privilege what is a privilege i didn't
[47:07] go to dr google i didn't go there i
[47:10] don't have an explanation for google
[47:12] and i didn't go to the dictionary i just
[47:14] want to say it not the way we know we've
[47:16] got a context of with privilege and the
[47:18] word also have got their own
[47:20] explanation
[47:22] but you see a privilege in my view a
[47:24] privilege is something that you don't
[47:25] buy yeah right you don't qualify or make
[47:29] an effort for a privilege
[47:31] a privilege is something that is given
[47:34] to you for free
[47:36] what are you qualified for it or not
[47:39] sorry brother you just happen to be in
[47:41] the front
[47:42] i'm preaching to everyone
[47:44] so it is a privilege a privilege is
[47:47] given to you it is a
[47:50] is something that not everybody receives
[47:52] but you
[47:53] you you you know when a child is born in
[47:56] the home
[47:57] that and the father sorry i always give
[47:59] whatever is there at home well the
[48:01] parents that that child has a privilege
[48:05] to be part of that family it's a
[48:07] privilege
[48:08] there's another child there fool i'm
[48:11] sorry to say this but the bible did say
[48:13] that child took the parents to court in
[48:15] india i think
[48:17] somebody said it here and
[48:19] wants to sue the parents
[48:21] for bringing him or her to earth
[48:24] what a wasted privilege
[48:27] what a wasted privilege
[48:29] because to be born in the family which
[48:31] you are born is a privilege if
[48:35] the only thing is just depends on how
[48:36] you look at it
[48:38] are we together so a privilege
[48:42] a boy who asked his father that he wants
[48:45] his riches
[48:47] and all everything of his share he wants
[48:50] to live
[48:52] he thought he was collecting all the
[48:53] privileges because he was measuring
[48:56] privileges according to money
[48:59] according to the things that he can see
[49:02] he did not realize that there was
[49:04] there's a blessing if you listen in the
[49:06] bible if you check
[49:08] jacob
[49:09] abraham
[49:10] david solomon all those patriarchs
[49:15] they i i've never seen that you know
[49:17] they were writing a will and say okay
[49:18] you are going to get this this piece of
[49:20] land and no no every time i hear them
[49:23] the bible says when they are about to
[49:25] die david called solomon and then he
[49:28] says i'm about to die and he blessed him
[49:30] isaac did the same and he says come
[49:33] because i'm going to my father now i'm
[49:35] going
[49:36] home now i'm going to bless
[49:39] those are the privileges i'm talking
[49:40] about
[49:41] those are the ones i'm talking about the
[49:43] privileges that you don't
[49:45] buy
[49:47] the ones that we can see with our eyes
[49:49] those are not eternal privileges so i'm
[49:53] talking about your eternal god-given
[49:56] privilege
[49:57] a privilege to be a daughter and a son
[50:00] of god
[50:02] right
[50:03] that is a privilege and then
[50:06] that privilege has got certain benefits
[50:10] a privilege that's called satan
[50:13] excuse me
[50:14] it has got uh things that comes with it
[50:18] yes it's the hannah it has things
[50:21] certain things come with privileges
[50:25] then the the the if you go there to
[50:27] parliament
[50:28] you'll find that they even have a
[50:30] committee
[50:31] a committee of privileges
[50:33] that committee is to assess and evaluate
[50:36] the privileges that the member of the
[50:38] members of parliament's health but then
[50:40] they look at it in terms of benefits and
[50:43] perks how would you say it in the accent
[50:46] perks
[50:47] you know benefits
[50:48] they look at it that way but we don't
[50:50] look at privileges that way so that
[50:52] committee will say what the prime
[50:54] minister will have these privileges
[50:56] bodyguards this this this a house like
[50:59] this a house of this standard a car of
[51:01] this standard huh
[51:03] and then you'll have
[51:04] and also even the spouse of the prime
[51:07] minister will have benefits privileges
[51:09] they have a commit in cabinet a
[51:12] committee that establishes those
[51:14] privileges
[51:16] but think about your committee in heaven
[51:20] think about your committee in heaven the
[51:22] committee of privilege is in heaven that
[51:25] allocates your privileges
[51:27] and they give them to you
[51:30] right
[51:32] so those privileges you and me are
[51:34] supposed to live
[51:36] within those privileges we are supposed
[51:38] to exercise them
[51:40] we are supposed to use them because if
[51:43] we don't then we are under privileging
[51:46] ourselves
[51:48] all right hold it a bit eh
[51:51] hold it there let's read um
[51:55] let's read uh
[51:57] i said we're going to read a few
[51:59] scriptures let's read matthew
[52:01] 22 we all know it also
[52:05] do we all know it matthew 22
[52:07] we you know matthew 22.
[52:11] can you please with me do you you know
[52:13] matthew 22.
[52:15] amen
[52:16] that one he talks about and
[52:20] uh
[52:21] the greatest commandment amen so
[52:26] within this uh uh living within your
[52:28] privileges i want us to identify two
[52:30] things two things the first one
[52:33] is
[52:34] uh you know
[52:36] the love of god first
[52:39] yeah the love of god first put in the
[52:42] love of god first and this is why this
[52:44] matthew 22 comes into the picture right
[52:46] then from there we will talk about after
[52:48] the love of god first we'll talk about
[52:50] the prayerfulness test those two tonight
[52:53] just to to show you that
[52:56] if you if if if you are underprivileged
[52:59] or you are living below your privilege
[53:01] you tend to neglect those two things
[53:03] right
[53:04] right let's read matthew it says matthew
[53:07] 22 i said this
[53:08] let's start from verse 37
[53:11] the bible says
[53:12] uh they were asking jesus some questions
[53:15] they were they were cross-questioning
[53:17] him and they said hey jesus what is the
[53:20] greatest commandment and you know they
[53:21] find that they always keep questioning
[53:23] because they are testing him and jesus
[53:25] said unto them unto him thou shalt love
[53:28] the lord thy god with all thy heart
[53:32] you see
[53:33] and with all thy soul
[53:36] and with all
[53:37] thy mind
[53:39] with all
[53:41] your mind your soul
[53:43] right
[53:44] all your being thou shalt love the lord
[53:46] your god that's the first one
[53:49] if you wake up
[53:51] if you sleep
[53:52] whatever you do thou shalt love the lord
[53:55] your god with all
[53:58] so what what is loving god what is it
[54:02] what is loving god we'll talk about that
[54:04] now right so jesus answered and let's
[54:06] let's go to verse 38
[54:08] then this is the first and greatest
[54:11] commandment
[54:12] this one of loving the lord your god
[54:15] right
[54:16] and then
[54:17] verse 39 and the second
[54:19] the second one
[54:21] is like unto it
[54:23] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self
[54:27] practically speaking
[54:29] according to the laws of satan's eden
[54:32] there's no way you can love someone like
[54:35] yours you love yourself
[54:38] can i can i demonstrate that to you
[54:40] if me and brother ben are sitting here
[54:42] now
[54:44] and then
[54:46] something happens
[54:48] on that side
[54:50] huh
[54:51] something that is so harming that wants
[54:52] to harm me and him
[54:55] the instinct
[54:57] is going to
[54:58] he's not going to try to protect me he's
[55:00] going to try first to protect himself
[55:03] but the bible says he must love himself
[55:07] like he loves me
[55:09] so why is he not protecting
[55:11] us
[55:13] why when a driver drives a car and then
[55:16] there's an accident always they say the
[55:18] safest seat is behind the driver because
[55:20] the driver instinct by instinct will try
[55:23] to you know to dodge the danger
[55:26] for his skin
[55:29] so but the balance is the second
[55:31] important rule
[55:32] love
[55:33] your love your neighbor
[55:36] as thyself
[55:38] can you see that is now not according to
[55:41] the laws of that is the privilege of
[55:44] heaven
[55:45] to love my brother and my sister like
[55:48] myself
[55:49] not just as a talk
[55:52] in reality the real thing
[55:55] which you can do i always say you know
[55:58] the truth is always when you are alone
[56:00] you see when you are alone the truth
[56:03] always has got no way to hide because
[56:05] you are just you and god the truth comes
[56:07] so that person you must love him or her
[56:11] even when you are alone you can confess
[56:14] it to the lord and say i love my brother
[56:16] like myself i'll i'll die for him
[56:19] that's too strong
[56:21] not too strong okay
[56:24] now jesus christ told them to love
[56:27] your neighbor thou shalt love thy
[56:28] neighbor as their self
[56:30] we live with that one let's go to romans
[56:34] remember the emphasis on that chapter is
[56:36] love
[56:37] and there's no way you can be able to do
[56:40] that if the love of god is not in
[56:42] you and that's the point i want to show
[56:44] you that in order for you to do that the
[56:47] love of god comes first
[56:49] for me to be able to to do that
[56:52] to life unconditionally
[56:55] is when i love god with all my heart my
[56:57] soul and my mind then i'll be able to
[57:00] say ah but isaac i don't have to tell
[57:02] you
[57:03] i love you with everything within me
[57:07] not to please him when i see him i say
[57:09] oh i haven't seen no no no for real when
[57:12] whether i see him or i don't see him
[57:15] amen that's the reality that i'm talking
[57:18] about
[57:18] only if you love god let's look at it
[57:22] from the perspective of romans chapter
[57:23] 8. romans chapter 8 what does he say i
[57:26] also love it
[57:27] i also love romans chapter 8. let's take
[57:29] it from verse 35
[57:31] and i'll try to be quick the children
[57:32] can you hear me say amen my children
[57:35] you can hear me praise the lord right
[57:37] romans 8 35
[57:41] i'll take it from
[57:44] okay let's take it from 34
[57:46] who is the who is he that commandeth
[57:49] it is christ who died yeah rather
[57:52] that is risen again who is even at the
[57:56] right hand of god who also make it
[57:58] intercession for us
[58:01] right
[58:02] now i like to read this scripture the
[58:04] bible says best 85 who
[58:08] who
[58:09] who shall separate us
[58:12] from the love of christ who
[58:16] what
[58:17] where
[58:19] how
[58:21] any of those things
[58:23] can separate you from the love of god
[58:24] what can
[58:26] okay
[58:28] shall tribulation or distress or
[58:30] persecution or faith or famine or
[58:33] nakedness or peril or sort
[58:35] the list goes on
[58:37] it's inexhaustible the least is
[58:38] inexhaustive
[58:40] you can't finish it nothing can separate
[58:43] you and me from the love of god why
[58:47] because it it was god first and the
[58:50] bible says god is
[58:52] love
[58:54] god by his love
[58:56] by his word
[58:57] him because remember
[59:00] okay let's go back to genesis in genesis
[59:02] the bible says god created all these
[59:04] things by his word right plus the logos
[59:06] and then the prophet dramatizes it and
[59:08] then as the son of man playing them
[59:10] trillions and trillions of years ago and
[59:12] then from there he said okay let there
[59:14] be logos and there was logos and then he
[59:16] started to create and then they're
[59:17] spinning and they said stop and then
[59:19] they stop and then that planet was there
[59:21] from brother i was like one time drama
[59:22] testing and then and then and then
[59:25] then then the lord was the wow the lord
[59:27] said wow today we say wow
[59:30] the lord loved it
[59:32] the lord loved his
[59:34] creation can you hear that he loved it
[59:38] god is love that is why on top of the
[59:40] pyramid we've got love i made a
[59:42] statement here one time and i said i
[59:44] suspect that at the bottom of the
[59:46] pyramid below faith there is also love
[59:50] you know
[59:50] have you ever put a sandwich together
[59:53] huh it's love love
[59:57] love at the beginning
[59:58] love at the end in fact love before the
[1:00:01] beginning
[1:00:03] right so
[1:00:04] what can separate us
[1:00:07] right as it is written for that i say we
[1:00:10] are killed all the day long we are
[1:00:13] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:00:15] in all these things we are more than
[1:00:17] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:00:21] you see i always want to underline the
[1:00:23] word love
[1:00:24] where i come across it because god is
[1:00:27] love
[1:00:28] and then in this in his love he chose
[1:00:30] you
[1:00:32] he chose you and he chose me
[1:00:35] listen to this that means you are part
[1:00:38] and parcel of god's love that means you
[1:00:41] if god is love and you are the bride of
[1:00:44] god you are loved
[1:00:49] so
[1:00:50] it's impossible therefore for any one of
[1:00:52] us not to love for real
[1:00:55] because you are love
[1:00:57] love does not love loves
[1:00:59] love covers a multitude of sin love love
[1:01:03] protects love forgives love do all those
[1:01:05] things love creates
[1:01:08] love embraces
[1:01:10] have you ever ever
[1:01:12] i'm just like brother ben says he's
[1:01:15] going everywhere i'm also going
[1:01:16] everywhere have you ever had a young man
[1:01:19] or a young woman and saying
[1:01:21] hey oh
[1:01:23] i love him so much
[1:01:24] or i love her so much you know she she's
[1:01:27] everything to me
[1:01:29] have you ever had that statement
[1:01:30] did anyone ever heard that oh i love my
[1:01:33] boy you know i love my son he's
[1:01:35] everything to me how can you say that
[1:01:40] that is true
[1:01:42] because jesus christ loves us we mean
[1:01:44] everything to him
[1:01:46] we mean everything to him so just just
[1:01:48] pause and think about it
[1:01:51] we are everything to him
[1:01:53] what are we
[1:01:55] who are we
[1:01:57] can you see now that takes you deep on
[1:02:00] the center of your god-given privilege
[1:02:02] because there's no way anyway someone
[1:02:04] can love you like that and you live
[1:02:06] outside of the boundary
[1:02:08] of the privilege
[1:02:10] you live below your privilege
[1:02:13] huh you and the bible says we must not
[1:02:16] be like the world
[1:02:18] and
[1:02:19] even
[1:02:21] the very appearance of the world we must
[1:02:23] shy away from it right we must be away
[1:02:26] from the things of the world and the
[1:02:28] very appearance
[1:02:30] that means that not even as
[1:02:32] aspect of the worldly appearance
[1:02:36] we should be closer to it because it
[1:02:37] takes us away from our privileges
[1:02:41] so if someone says i love him so much he
[1:02:43] means everything to me or he is
[1:02:46] everything to me she is everything
[1:02:48] to me
[1:02:49] he is my world
[1:02:51] you've had this statement before please
[1:02:53] let's be realistic you've had it
[1:02:55] he's my world you know
[1:02:57] i love him so much that's my wife now
[1:02:59] he's my he's my world yeah
[1:03:04] you've heard this kind of statement
[1:03:05] you've had it sister it's not the first
[1:03:07] time you've had it yeah little children
[1:03:09] you love mama and daddy so much
[1:03:12] they mean everything to me mom and dad
[1:03:16] and that's how the lord jesus christ
[1:03:18] looks at you
[1:03:20] that's how me and you should look at him
[1:03:23] on a daily basis right so let's come
[1:03:26] back to that point of the scripture of
[1:03:29] the one i was reading of romans did i
[1:03:31] finish it
[1:03:33] he says
[1:03:35] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:03:38] nor life nor angels no principalities no
[1:03:41] powers
[1:03:42] no things present no things to come
[1:03:45] this is so serious a statement
[1:03:48] because
[1:03:49] paul is trying to over emphasize to
[1:03:51] emphasize that nothing nothing
[1:03:53] absolutely zero not in this world
[1:03:57] not outside this world not angels he
[1:04:00] says here
[1:04:05] no angels no principalities
[1:04:07] will separate me from the love of god
[1:04:10] that is what the prophet said you know
[1:04:12] even if he throws me in hell
[1:04:14] i will still love you
[1:04:16] this is this is a powerful statement
[1:04:18] that many times we think we understand
[1:04:20] it he says if he throws me in anywhere
[1:04:24] i'll still love him
[1:04:27] does that make
[1:04:28] common sense
[1:04:30] no
[1:04:30] but that that makes holy sense
[1:04:33] it's a holy sense that one that he can
[1:04:35] throw me there but i still love him
[1:04:37] because god is the fountain of love and
[1:04:41] that's where things begin
[1:04:43] that's where things start
[1:04:44] let's hear from matthew 24 this is the
[1:04:47] last scripture then we finish our same
[1:04:49] one
[1:04:50] meteor 24 i wrote it here if i'm not
[1:04:54] reading it correctly just say sorry
[1:04:56] brother
[1:04:58] and because iniquity shall abound
[1:05:01] the love of many
[1:05:03] shall wax cold
[1:05:05] remember i spoke about satan's eating
[1:05:07] now we are living in satan's eating the
[1:05:09] devil wants to works called our love for
[1:05:12] god and for one another and he there he
[1:05:16] knows if he's doing that he's pulling us
[1:05:18] out of our privileges he's pulling us
[1:05:21] out of our day god given privileges and
[1:05:25] the devil gets you so well and so easy
[1:05:28] if you're living outside the realms of
[1:05:30] your privilege
[1:05:31] let's talk about that boy who left his
[1:05:33] home
[1:05:34] didn't the devil get him
[1:05:37] did not the devil get him he first
[1:05:39] finished his money and then he got him
[1:05:42] to eat with pigs
[1:05:44] that's what happens when you move away
[1:05:46] from the realms of your privileges
[1:05:48] now
[1:05:49] because this is laodicea
[1:05:52] the spirit is so subtle
[1:05:54] it's almost like when serpent
[1:05:57] came to the garden of eden
[1:06:00] he was so subtle
[1:06:02] he was so innocent
[1:06:03] he was so like
[1:06:05] anyone who could reason who said no no
[1:06:07] no come on this is a nice guy
[1:06:10] what are you taking him for if
[1:06:13] anyone could have said that meanwhile
[1:06:15] god created all the animals male and
[1:06:17] female i was telling brother ben i said
[1:06:19] you know after god created all males and
[1:06:22] females the serpent was also an upright
[1:06:24] animal
[1:06:25] the prophet taught us that he was an
[1:06:27] upright animal and working and and
[1:06:30] reasoning talking that's why he could
[1:06:32] when he could go there to eve and speak
[1:06:34] to eve and reason with if you are so
[1:06:36] subtle he was the reason showing her he
[1:06:38] was speaking more sense than if her
[1:06:40] husband
[1:06:42] he was so subtle
[1:06:44] and he made sense
[1:06:46] and then
[1:06:48] these days that we are living in
[1:06:50] we are living in those subtle days
[1:06:53] the devil
[1:06:55] is not gonna come and say
[1:06:57] uh you know like in the dark ages
[1:06:59] or in the
[1:07:01] in the days of when rome was making
[1:07:03] people pay money i mean in today's world
[1:07:05] really
[1:07:06] people will say come on really now
[1:07:09] that's what today they will say you want
[1:07:11] to make me pay for my sins really now
[1:07:14] that's how we will talk today because it
[1:07:15] doesn't make sense because those are the
[1:07:17] dark ages that today we are living in
[1:07:19] the apex
[1:07:20] of satan's idiot he doesn't come like
[1:07:22] that and say brother for you
[1:07:25] you must pay first before you can be
[1:07:26] forgiven no today he comes so subtle
[1:07:29] so subtle that the enemy can come in
[1:07:32] here if we are not aware
[1:07:35] and we are not aware of him
[1:07:38] and he sits here with us
[1:07:40] and then he spends time with us and we
[1:07:43] are not realizing that hey this spirit
[1:07:45] we must cast it out
[1:07:46] but hey
[1:07:48] the devil can come in your life let's
[1:07:50] forget about church a bit he can come in
[1:07:52] your life
[1:07:53] and every day you say every day
[1:07:56] and every hour
[1:07:59] and you come to church but the devil has
[1:08:01] encroached and he's going to hold on
[1:08:03] certain things that you can let go
[1:08:06] you are living below the privilege are
[1:08:08] you not
[1:08:09] you are
[1:08:10] because the bible says search yourself
[1:08:15] do an introspection don't be afraid to
[1:08:18] look into your life and say god open me
[1:08:21] remind me lord show me the things that i
[1:08:24] don't know about myself
[1:08:26] ah brother ended up to preach about the
[1:08:28] subconscious you know you can you can
[1:08:30] stop unconsciously disbelieve god
[1:08:35] unconsciously not intentionally
[1:08:38] not on papers but just because you move
[1:08:42] away from your privilege
[1:08:44] lying
[1:08:45] and you unconsciously
[1:08:47] unaware
[1:08:49] at my work one time the previous week
[1:08:51] they taught us about
[1:08:52] unconscious bias
[1:08:54] unconscious biasedness where someone
[1:08:57] just treat you and but in a bias way and
[1:09:00] away not on papers
[1:09:04] so that thing happens so let us not
[1:09:06] unconsciously
[1:09:08] live below our privileges and the only
[1:09:11] thing that is going to help us if we get
[1:09:13] more exposed and closer in the center of
[1:09:16] this pivot called the love of god
[1:09:19] putting him first with everything amen
[1:09:22] that is what will help us that is what
[1:09:24] will actually make our love not to works
[1:09:27] cold
[1:09:28] there's no way i'm gonna say brother ben
[1:09:31] i love you so much my friend i'll i can
[1:09:34] even give you my car
[1:09:36] but i don't love god
[1:09:40] what kind
[1:09:41] what kind of love is that one
[1:09:43] it's true i must love him but
[1:09:45] do i did i put god first because the
[1:09:47] first commandment is to love god with
[1:09:49] all my heart and all my soul
[1:09:51] are we together saints
[1:09:55] now when we talk about love and we are
[1:09:57] now into that first aspect the first
[1:09:59] point of putting god first loving god
[1:10:01] unconditionally with those
[1:10:03] everything within me right now when you
[1:10:06] talk about love
[1:10:08] you see when you talk about love you
[1:10:09] talk about
[1:10:10] a
[1:10:12] a decision i like to believe that love
[1:10:15] goes together with a decision there's no
[1:10:17] way i can love without making a decision
[1:10:20] huh
[1:10:22] there's a decision when you talk about
[1:10:23] love you hear about a decision
[1:10:26] i make
[1:10:27] my mind
[1:10:28] i make up my mind to take god's way for
[1:10:31] the rest of my life
[1:10:33] you made up your mind so
[1:10:35] when you talk about love we talk about
[1:10:37] sacrifice
[1:10:38] you hear those things there's no way you
[1:10:41] can talk about love without talking
[1:10:42] about sacrifice didn't he die at the
[1:10:45] cross because he loved us didn't he go
[1:10:46] and sacrifice there
[1:10:48] can you love your brother and your
[1:10:50] sister but not sacrifice for him
[1:10:54] so
[1:10:55] carry thy cross and follow me that is
[1:10:58] sacrifice
[1:11:00] are we together
[1:11:01] when we talk about love we talk about
[1:11:03] commitment
[1:11:05] do you children understand what is
[1:11:07] commitment
[1:11:08] what is to commit
[1:11:10] to commit
[1:11:12] is to it's almost like to bind yourself
[1:11:15] for the camera income sanction yes my
[1:11:17] goal what is commitment
[1:11:20] to
[1:11:21] to give everything
[1:11:23] to say here
[1:11:28] it was him who preached the same one
[1:11:29] here he said today draw a line here
[1:11:34] i'm not going that way i'm making a
[1:11:36] commitment devil i'm not going to cross
[1:11:38] this line
[1:11:40] no
[1:11:41] not today
[1:11:43] so commitment is about that and when we
[1:11:46] talk we hear about love it was a great
[1:11:48] commitment that the lord did
[1:11:50] to leave heaven
[1:11:52] come here to earth to come and be
[1:11:54] crucified for me and for you that's why
[1:11:56] i wanted us to sing that song at the
[1:11:58] beginning when we talk about love we
[1:12:00] talk of action
[1:12:02] there's no love there's no love if
[1:12:04] there's no action
[1:12:07] i love you
[1:12:08] every day i love you honey
[1:12:10] but you never buy me a flower
[1:12:13] ah come on foreign
[1:12:15] flavanana they're from levine
[1:12:18] yes that's for you
[1:12:21] so not necessarily a flaw i'm just
[1:12:22] giving example because he's my friend
[1:12:24] but i mean love without action
[1:12:27] have you seen it
[1:12:30] so
[1:12:31] all these things that i'm counting you
[1:12:33] can think of the lord jesus christ he
[1:12:34] did them he did all these things and you
[1:12:37] are the bride of the lord that means
[1:12:40] there are certain things that we need to
[1:12:42] do
[1:12:43] yes we are the bride remember it's not
[1:12:45] this way it's this way let me explain to
[1:12:48] you it's not
[1:12:50] that you are a son and a daughter of god
[1:12:53] therefore is automatic you'll go in
[1:12:57] regardless
[1:12:59] no no
[1:13:00] it is because of the what the way you do
[1:13:03] things and you live the the life and the
[1:13:06] weight of the lord that actually shows
[1:13:08] that you are a son and a daughter
[1:13:11] of god
[1:13:12] it it actually proves that you are a son
[1:13:15] and a daughter the way you do things the
[1:13:16] way you sacrifice the way you live
[1:13:20] within your privileges god given ones we
[1:13:24] say oh
[1:13:25] remember there was a story in the bible
[1:13:28] that says
[1:13:29] i can't recall very well but
[1:13:32] oh yeah after they crucified the lord
[1:13:34] jesus christ after they crucified him
[1:13:37] they said
[1:13:38] there was earthquakes and things like
[1:13:40] that and they say they started to say oh
[1:13:41] they said truly surely he was the son of
[1:13:44] god
[1:13:44] remember
[1:13:46] surely
[1:13:48] so when we walk on earth brother arnold
[1:13:50] here people should say no surely there's
[1:13:52] something about that man
[1:13:54] in the train people must say
[1:13:58] you know people must see the love of god
[1:14:01] in your daily life
[1:14:03] they must feel it
[1:14:05] they must want to be next to you because
[1:14:07] you are admitting it
[1:14:10] you know there's some atmosphere around
[1:14:12] you the prophet says here
[1:14:15] oh yes i wanted to say there's
[1:14:16] attachment also you know there's
[1:14:18] attachment
[1:14:19] you know no no there's when you are
[1:14:21] attached to something
[1:14:23] the lord
[1:14:24] attached himself to us
[1:14:26] he said i cannot this is the apple of my
[1:14:28] eye
[1:14:31] he had faith in you
[1:14:33] the lord who created you remember the
[1:14:36] lord knows you more than you know
[1:14:38] yourself
[1:14:39] and he created you and he knows all the
[1:14:42] ingredients in you he knows the
[1:14:43] qualities in you he knows your character
[1:14:46] you're a real one he knows your
[1:14:47] personality he knows everything
[1:14:50] and then he's saying to you i've got
[1:14:52] faith in you and confidence
[1:14:55] and then you don't want to have
[1:14:56] confidence in yourself
[1:14:59] ah
[1:15:00] have confidence in the word of god
[1:15:03] because when you are the word of god you
[1:15:06] are part of the love of christ then you
[1:15:07] are going to find not having confidence
[1:15:10] in yourself in a proud way
[1:15:12] in the in the love of god because in
[1:15:15] there you are there
[1:15:16] in that pot that's where you are and
[1:15:18] that's where your confidence is
[1:15:21] then you can do this thank you lord that
[1:15:23] i'm your son and i'm your i'm your
[1:15:25] daughter
[1:15:27] and people say hey
[1:15:28] you know you know you know if you can
[1:15:30] stand in the train and say i greet you
[1:15:32] people today i want to tell you about
[1:15:34] what the lord has done for me and i love
[1:15:35] you he loves me so much they are going
[1:15:37] to say so he didn't love us
[1:15:41] people would say but didn't he love us
[1:15:44] they want to say ah tell us about that
[1:15:46] love no they say no didn't he love us if
[1:15:48] he loved you didn't he love us that's
[1:15:50] the mentality the devil always wants to
[1:15:52] put things upside down so now now you'll
[1:15:55] be trying to tell them
[1:15:57] what god has done
[1:15:59] for you
[1:16:00] and what he can do for them
[1:16:02] you will be trying to tell them to bring
[1:16:05] them within the realms of their
[1:16:06] privileges
[1:16:08] god-given privileges let me read for you
[1:16:10] a few things here then we can close
[1:16:13] and
[1:16:14] what the prophet said here
[1:16:16] now
[1:16:18] he says the prophet in the message
[1:16:21] love
[1:16:22] he says now
[1:16:24] this is very nice he says now do you
[1:16:27] do you hear are you enjoying the golden
[1:16:29] nuggets are you enjoying the disease
[1:16:31] he says now do you realize
[1:16:33] do you realize being a son or a daughter
[1:16:36] the father did not put their sisters out
[1:16:38] sister sister
[1:16:40] he talked about daughters as well
[1:16:43] do you realize being a son or daughter
[1:16:45] of god that you you
[1:16:48] sorry for pointing at you you
[1:16:51] you are a minor
[1:16:53] creator
[1:16:55] do you know that
[1:16:56] do you know that you are a creator you
[1:16:59] are an amateur god
[1:17:04] can i hear amen
[1:17:06] because it is true that's what you are
[1:17:08] that's who you are
[1:17:10] you are an amateur god you are a minor
[1:17:12] creator
[1:17:14] you can create oh they said i must not
[1:17:15] call the tea i i can't help it someone
[1:17:18] said we mustn't call it he must say
[1:17:20] creda
[1:17:26] sorry i don't i don't mean to joke
[1:17:29] just but you can hear me you are my
[1:17:30] people you can hear me hopefully on
[1:17:33] youtube and hear me
[1:17:34] you are a creator a minor creator you
[1:17:37] can create
[1:17:38] because why what makes you a creator
[1:17:40] because you are part of god
[1:17:43] so that's why i'm emphasizing that as a
[1:17:46] child of god beware
[1:17:48] of living beyond your privilege
[1:17:51] you are a creator
[1:17:54] once you are on that pivot you know a
[1:17:55] pivot
[1:17:56] brother
[1:17:58] is that a
[1:18:00] thing that they use
[1:18:01] a pivot line that they use to spray for
[1:18:04] vegetables in the big farms you know
[1:18:05] they put a pivot it goes around it's
[1:18:07] called the pivot sprayer
[1:18:10] it's got the people then it can go
[1:18:11] around you know it does not lose the
[1:18:13] light it's on the pivot so it can go all
[1:18:15] around those little wheels they don't
[1:18:17] lose it's pivoted
[1:18:19] so once we get pivoted in the center on
[1:18:22] the pivot of the lap of god
[1:18:25] that's when you realize that hey
[1:18:29] that's why the lord jesus christ could
[1:18:30] not say
[1:18:31] hey rise up he had to specify lazarus
[1:18:35] that's why brother branham when he was
[1:18:37] this is the haiti right huh
[1:18:39] she could have got anything
[1:18:41] it is true she would have got anything
[1:18:44] tonight my brother my sister you can get
[1:18:47] anything just be pivoted
[1:18:50] just be within the boundary you know
[1:18:52] when we said boundary we said this is
[1:18:54] the boundary this is where your
[1:18:56] privileges are around this white board
[1:18:59] and then we find you here
[1:19:05] how do we expect to get the benefits
[1:19:10] or here
[1:19:12] no we can't so our daily life is to
[1:19:16] ensure that we love god so much and that
[1:19:19] is what is going because god is on the
[1:19:22] center
[1:19:23] he's on the center of this thing that we
[1:19:26] are talking about of our privileges of
[1:19:28] our benefits of our safety of our
[1:19:31] redemption of our eternal life of our
[1:19:33] everything
[1:19:35] he's on the center
[1:19:36] and that's where we must be
[1:19:38] to love him so much
[1:19:40] because once we are there
[1:19:43] they say the rest is history
[1:19:46] the rest is history
[1:19:48] you can name anything you can you can
[1:19:50] think of anything
[1:19:52] you what are you talking about when you
[1:19:54] are on the center when you are pivoted
[1:19:58] your privileges everything is
[1:20:00] autopiloted
[1:20:02] everything is automated
[1:20:05] do you know you can create at the
[1:20:07] atmosphere that you live in you
[1:20:10] that's the prophet here
[1:20:12] in the spoken word called love 5607-26
[1:20:15] you do you know you crea you do you know
[1:20:19] you create the atmosphere that you live
[1:20:21] in
[1:20:23] we create atmospheres but which ones yes
[1:20:27] are we great what atmospheres are we
[1:20:29] creating because we've got the
[1:20:32] the power we have been given a privilege
[1:20:35] to be able to create the right
[1:20:37] atmosphere one day the pastor said a
[1:20:39] statement and i never forget he said
[1:20:41] atmosphere is everything oh
[1:20:44] yes atmosphere
[1:20:47] me and you have got the power to create
[1:20:49] the atmosphere
[1:20:51] that we live in
[1:20:53] right do you realize that the atmosphere
[1:20:56] that you dwell in
[1:20:58] you influence somebody else
[1:21:03] i can't emphasize on it
[1:21:06] loving the unlovable unblocks god's love
[1:21:10] loving what nobody may want to love
[1:21:13] written offs
[1:21:16] have you ever heard of the people called
[1:21:17] written ops
[1:21:19] loving those ones
[1:21:21] the lord loved those ones
[1:21:24] he was associated with those ones he was
[1:21:26] found among them eating with them the
[1:21:29] people that today me and you will say oh
[1:21:31] no just give them food let them go
[1:21:34] just give them food let them go they're
[1:21:35] just
[1:21:36] you know and then no no him he said let
[1:21:38] them come in
[1:21:40] he put he that's why that man martin he
[1:21:43] cut his jacket
[1:21:45] and shared with that man on the street
[1:21:48] because he loved the unlovable
[1:21:50] now
[1:21:51] when you are on the pivoted love of god
[1:21:55] that's the kind of things that you do
[1:21:57] you do things that nobody understands
[1:21:59] because you are an odd ball
[1:22:03] now listen to this one let me throw let
[1:22:06] me just throw this one in
[1:22:08] now in state in instead
[1:22:10] of
[1:22:11] well i'm sick i'm
[1:22:13] i was scared sure
[1:22:16] but when i looked at him something began
[1:22:17] to happen instead of thinking oh if i
[1:22:20] was a big enough i would whip you
[1:22:23] instead of that i god of thinking poor
[1:22:25] brother the devil's got him pound
[1:22:28] why
[1:22:30] why did the devil get involved he'll
[1:22:32] want to love me as much as i love him
[1:22:36] right he can't help being like that the
[1:22:39] prophet was talking about someone
[1:22:40] someone else who who was who was upset
[1:22:44] with him huh and that's that's not him
[1:22:47] kissing me
[1:22:48] that's the devil
[1:22:51] that is with any man
[1:22:54] is not the man that is kissing you
[1:22:57] that you want to be get to have to get
[1:22:59] angry with and kill him in a few minutes
[1:23:02] no
[1:23:03] it is the devil making him to do that
[1:23:06] not your brother
[1:23:07] is the devil he is possessed with
[1:23:11] that's what the prophet says here
[1:23:14] now
[1:23:15] that one is the one you must love the
[1:23:17] one who will say
[1:23:18] i'll did anyone ever did that to you
[1:23:24] so that one is the one that you must
[1:23:26] look at him differently and and love him
[1:23:29] because the prophet and the word taught
[1:23:31] us that love is a powerful force
[1:23:35] it's so powerful
[1:23:39] and they will talk about the power the
[1:23:41] force of love
[1:23:42] because it quenches
[1:23:45] anything you can think of they say water
[1:23:46] is the hardest surface no it's not
[1:23:49] love
[1:23:52] a christian loves the lord and he loves
[1:23:54] him with in such a way that there is
[1:23:56] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:23:58] god which is in christ jesus paul said
[1:24:01] neither death nor sorrow neither perils
[1:24:03] or
[1:24:04] prisoners or anything can separate us
[1:24:06] from the love of god that's in jesus
[1:24:08] christ oh my
[1:24:09] and real true
[1:24:12] the prophet is just re-emphasizing what
[1:24:14] i was saying in the message near the
[1:24:16] church age he said you just just keep
[1:24:18] loving
[1:24:20] i don't care how much people hate you
[1:24:24] you love them anyhow
[1:24:28] because you've realized something
[1:24:31] you have realized something something
[1:24:33] has been revealed to you
[1:24:35] that
[1:24:36] if i do that
[1:24:37] i'm within my privileges
[1:24:39] i get what i want
[1:24:41] i get my benefits i get my relationship
[1:24:44] with my savior is everything is at its
[1:24:47] best
[1:24:48] when i do that when i love the lord
[1:24:51] so don't allow no one to take you out of
[1:24:54] your privileges
[1:24:55] by making you bitter but no no no no no
[1:24:58] no that's for them
[1:25:00] not for you that's for them
[1:25:02] you rather pray for them for because
[1:25:04] it's not them
[1:25:06] amen let's leave that one because any
[1:25:08] root of bitterness
[1:25:10] is the devil
[1:25:13] and a believer must be able to know that
[1:25:15] oh a root of bitterness is imaging
[1:25:18] how am i supposed to react
[1:25:21] to my brother or my sister how
[1:25:25] you you many times we try to help others
[1:25:29] even the bible says as i'm trying to
[1:25:32] help you
[1:25:33] i fall because maybe you're heavy for me
[1:25:37] the bible says beware be careful that
[1:25:39] when you are trying to help your brother
[1:25:41] that you fall on the same
[1:25:43] because in my behavior
[1:25:46] i might be trying to lift up brother
[1:25:47] phil
[1:25:49] and a car and i follow i fall on him
[1:25:52] so therefore when i lift him up i must
[1:25:54] make sure that i'm standing
[1:25:56] right
[1:25:57] properly
[1:25:59] oh call brother ben to come help me
[1:26:02] he lift him because you see
[1:26:04] otherwise
[1:26:06] sorry brother just using that's a
[1:26:08] physical example otherwise we fall on
[1:26:10] that spot where he is so be careful
[1:26:13] don't allow anything to obscure you
[1:26:17] amen
[1:26:18] only if you are within the love if you
[1:26:20] love god so much
[1:26:22] you'll know that him have you ever
[1:26:25] watched that film called the passion of
[1:26:26] christ
[1:26:28] have you watched it it's one of those
[1:26:29] that is so moving so so moving that you
[1:26:33] know you see you can imagine that what
[1:26:35] they did to him spitting
[1:26:37] and whipping him until you know they
[1:26:39] were whipping him with a whip which has
[1:26:42] got some spikes
[1:26:44] that when they hit him when he they pull
[1:26:46] it it removes flesh
[1:26:48] and you see the bones
[1:26:53] why did he choose to do that
[1:26:56] they whip him so much
[1:26:58] when he finishes there he look at them
[1:27:00] he says lord
[1:27:03] forgive them
[1:27:05] for they don't know what they are doing
[1:27:08] that just makes you cry you know
[1:27:11] to
[1:27:12] to go through that
[1:27:14] and then someone where do you find the
[1:27:16] courage
[1:27:18] he was supposed to be focusing on
[1:27:20] himself
[1:27:21] saying oh lord just help me to sustain
[1:27:22] this pain
[1:27:24] please no he didn't instead
[1:27:26] he says oh just forgive the poor souls
[1:27:32] and they were eating so hard
[1:27:34] you know when they were hitting him they
[1:27:36] the blood is spat on them and they wipe
[1:27:39] and they saw soldiers they were inspired
[1:27:41] by that evil devil and they were hitting
[1:27:43] him so much
[1:27:46] why did they do that i mean why did he
[1:27:48] agree to go into that
[1:27:50] because of me and you
[1:27:53] because of me he loved us so much
[1:27:57] he one we are so much part of him that
[1:28:00] he'll he's gonna is creating another
[1:28:02] world
[1:28:03] a new
[1:28:04] dispensation a new civilization for you
[1:28:07] and me don't you realize that is too
[1:28:09] much love
[1:28:11] that is a lot of love
[1:28:13] so nothing should separate you from that
[1:28:15] love
[1:28:16] and then because when you are in there
[1:28:18] in that love
[1:28:20] you are sorted
[1:28:22] all is sorted
[1:28:24] so don't allow no nothing
[1:28:26] to disturb you
[1:28:29] let's talk about prayerfulness
[1:28:32] and then we close i think we've talked
[1:28:34] we're spoken we'll never talk enough
[1:28:35] about love it is such a powerful force
[1:28:39] now
[1:28:40] we find one place there where the son of
[1:28:43] god spends so much time in prayer
[1:28:46] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[1:28:48] prayer to stay in fellowship in with
[1:28:51] spirit that was in him
[1:28:54] in other words if jesus had to pray so
[1:28:56] much
[1:28:57] so much spending so much time in prayer
[1:29:00] he says here how much more do you and i
[1:29:03] have to spend in prayer
[1:29:05] this is the challenge to me
[1:29:07] to me
[1:29:11] we sing a song isn't it he says it's me
[1:29:13] not my brother not my sister
[1:29:16] let's not only sing it when we want
[1:29:18] blessings
[1:29:20] it's me oh lord who wants the healing
[1:29:23] who wants the blessings yes
[1:29:25] but also it's me who wants correction
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:29] it's me who wants to be reminded here
[1:29:32] that lord is brother
[1:29:34] who must spend time
[1:29:37] in prayer so that when he comes here to
[1:29:39] preach he must be inspired he must be
[1:29:42] taught of god
[1:29:45] to say the things that god wants
[1:29:47] he must have repented from his sin
[1:29:50] before god and put himself aside
[1:29:54] when we come to church we need to put
[1:29:56] ourselves aside not just the minister
[1:29:58] and us
[1:29:59] the the people who are sitting down to
[1:30:02] set ourselves aside to pray for the
[1:30:03] service
[1:30:06] we don't have to be going in the closet
[1:30:08] at that special time no no while you are
[1:30:10] working while you're walking while you
[1:30:11] are thinking praying say oh tonight lord
[1:30:15] won't you help that brother
[1:30:16] he's got weaknesses i know but won't you
[1:30:19] help him lord just use him even if he's
[1:30:21] just one weight load i'm asking father
[1:30:23] god you know just talking to the lord as
[1:30:26] you go along
[1:30:27] having time to think to bring yourself
[1:30:29] closer and closer to the atmosphere
[1:30:33] healing of jared's daughter
[1:30:35] get away from this old lukewarm halfway
[1:30:38] say a little prayer of of a morning a
[1:30:42] little prayer at night and then go go to
[1:30:44] bed and get up the next morning no no no
[1:30:47] he says get away from that kind of a
[1:30:49] prayer
[1:30:50] this is hard
[1:30:51] you need to pray morning evenings the
[1:30:54] best time and everybody says no no get
[1:30:56] away
[1:30:58] no wonder we are getting wealthy
[1:31:01] no wonder the world creep into the
[1:31:03] church because we don't stay in prayer
[1:31:06] we don't brother and we don't
[1:31:12] god help us
[1:31:14] there's no more organizing
[1:31:17] there's no more staying before god
[1:31:20] there's no more digging out cleaning up
[1:31:23] i salute the young people
[1:31:25] join them if you can every monday here
[1:31:28] half past seven to pray
[1:31:31] let's support them
[1:31:39] it is the secret prayer that jesus spoke
[1:31:42] of
[1:31:43] this is in the message 570301
[1:31:46] and
[1:31:47] it is the secret prayer that jesus spoke
[1:31:49] of saying anti-ye into a secret closet
[1:31:53] and close the door
[1:31:55] and when you have had its soul pray to
[1:31:58] your father who sees in secret and he
[1:32:01] that seeth in secret shall reward you
[1:32:04] openly
[1:32:06] there seems to be something to to the
[1:32:08] prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out
[1:32:11] of it it seems like that we get in a
[1:32:14] better connection with god
[1:32:17] when we do that kind of a prayer and
[1:32:19] i've experienced it when you take the
[1:32:21] time and you are alone
[1:32:24] not tell us that they don't call me i'm
[1:32:25] now in prayer no no no
[1:32:27] don't whatsapp us
[1:32:29] take time go in the closet and pray
[1:32:34] it's easier it seems like
[1:32:36] that we get in a better connection with
[1:32:39] god
[1:32:40] to get alone
[1:32:42] you know there's something about getting
[1:32:44] alone to yourself
[1:32:49] how many are going to do that
[1:32:51] how many are going to do that i'm not
[1:32:52] looking at you the lord is looking in
[1:32:55] the message that was pretty 52024
[1:32:58] christ gave us the authority with his
[1:33:01] name
[1:33:02] by being christians
[1:33:05] it is a privilege
[1:33:11] it is a privilege yes not
[1:33:16] general christian no to be a christian
[1:33:19] it means to be christ like that's what
[1:33:22] it means to be a christian is not
[1:33:24] religion it's not church if you come
[1:33:26] here to church every sunday and you no
[1:33:28] no that does not make you a christian
[1:33:32] just to come here to shakaina
[1:33:35] or to be born in the family of message
[1:33:36] believers who are a christian because my
[1:33:38] parents are born my parents are
[1:33:40] christians no no that doesn't make you a
[1:33:42] christian
[1:33:43] to be a christian is to be class life
[1:33:46] right
[1:33:47] the most powerful weapon the world has
[1:33:49] ever known is prayer
[1:33:52] you have been given authority
[1:33:54] in his name
[1:33:56] of being christians
[1:33:57] and i say christian
[1:33:59] one of the most powerful force
[1:34:02] or weapon
[1:34:04] is prayer
[1:34:05] we find that prayer brings you closer to
[1:34:07] god
[1:34:08] you find that prayer brings you closer
[1:34:11] in fellowship with god
[1:34:13] it brings you closer in love with god
[1:34:16] prayer the christian doesn't realize
[1:34:19] what a force he has when he kneels under
[1:34:21] his knees before almighty god in the
[1:34:24] name of jesus christ he doesn't realize
[1:34:27] what
[1:34:28] what powerful that is
[1:34:31] so powerful
[1:34:33] it's so powerful that the devils are
[1:34:35] running as you are starting to kneel
[1:34:37] because you come already you're entering
[1:34:40] in the atmosphere the demons are jumping
[1:34:43] and bumping each other's heads
[1:34:44] as you do that
[1:34:46] you don't see them
[1:34:48] the prophet used to see them
[1:34:50] they're running around panicking
[1:34:53] he used to say use it another one like a
[1:34:54] tortoise there another one like your bed
[1:34:58] they say come help me they are calling
[1:34:59] each other as you start to pray
[1:35:04] that's why he could say
[1:35:06] the prayer a very sincere prayer even
[1:35:08] for a weakest believer
[1:35:10] i consider myself weak even for the
[1:35:12] weakest believer
[1:35:14] when he start to pray sincerely
[1:35:18] things move
[1:35:19] when a sincere prayer comes from the
[1:35:21] weakest heart of life
[1:35:25] when it comes sincerely
[1:35:27] the way the prophet says the demons
[1:35:30] they call each other for help
[1:35:34] so isn't that a privilege
[1:35:36] i think that's the greatest privilege
[1:35:39] i don't even want to see them i know
[1:35:41] they are running
[1:35:45] apply the token in prayer
[1:35:48] with with with consideration with
[1:35:50] believing apply it with such love
[1:35:55] can you feel the connection again
[1:35:57] he's talking about apply talk the token
[1:36:00] in prayer and do it with such
[1:36:02] consideration believing it apply it with
[1:36:05] such love
[1:36:09] how can i just tell my wife oh i love
[1:36:10] you but i don't mean it yeah no me need
[1:36:14] when you say god i love you you come
[1:36:16] before him you'll if you don't you feel
[1:36:18] like you're short ask him lord give me
[1:36:21] more of your love
[1:36:23] because father i want more i want i want
[1:36:25] an overdose
[1:36:28] of your love
[1:36:30] i want to be overdosed with your life
[1:36:33] i want that overdose
[1:36:36] i really want it i want to be overdosed
[1:36:40] to be immersed
[1:36:42] that when i walk it's just love of god
[1:36:44] everywhere everyone can touch it
[1:36:48] that's what i want do you remember that
[1:36:50] little bear
[1:36:52] that that bear that was leaking on that
[1:36:54] little one he had honey everywhere
[1:36:57] honey everywhere he was sticky with love
[1:37:00] with honey that's what we want that's
[1:37:03] what we want that is the glue that is
[1:37:05] going to bring us together that is what
[1:37:07] is what is going to bring us closer to
[1:37:09] the lord within our privileges then when
[1:37:12] we ask yeah
[1:37:14] god will say no no no no
[1:37:16] they don't even have to ask gabrielle
[1:37:21] before they will even start to ask
[1:37:24] are we here
[1:37:26] before amen
[1:37:28] why because you are asking from the
[1:37:30] pivotal area
[1:37:32] so i would like us to go and do that
[1:37:34] i would like to talk one time about
[1:37:36] other things you know about uh removing
[1:37:39] fear we'll talk later on about taking
[1:37:41] stock
[1:37:42] taking stock
[1:37:44] you know if you want to live within the
[1:37:45] rails you need to top to pause
[1:37:49] to pause
[1:37:51] and take stock
[1:37:54] to be able to understand your identity
