[48:12] Shamar and a modern day Shema there's
[48:17] only one verse in the Bible that talks
[48:19] about this man but his story is heroic
[48:22] and it's a story of a son of ab abam a
[48:26] Son of God who has faith and a man or a
[48:30] person who the devil is scared of and
[48:33] tonight you're going to see how scared
[48:35] the devil is of each one of you amen
[48:39] from the youngest to the
[48:41] oldest amen and so when the Philistines
[48:44] March up the aisle they're going to
[48:46] March and sink and I want everybody to
[48:49] join in on the March just to add a bit
[48:51] of dramatic effect but for you young
[48:55] ones don't get too carried away when
[48:56] they get to the front we're going to
[48:58] stop marching okay so praise the Lord
[49:01] and I just want you to realize that the
[49:04] cycle breaker is here and when you see
[49:08] what's going on with this play if
[49:10] there's a cycle in your life that you
[49:12] don't want anymore I want you to lay it
[49:14] at the cross I want you to lay it down
[49:17] and let God set you free God bless
[49:24] you
[49:29] this is shanga shamba is a true
[49:31] Israelite a son of Abraham living in the
[49:34] promised land in his inheritance the
[49:36] fruits of his land belong to him he has
[49:38] joy peace and the moving of the Holy
[49:40] Ghost and his children live in a Godly
[49:45] atmosphere shanga got so used to all
[49:48] these blessings from his position as a
[49:50] Son of God that he began to take the
[49:52] supernatural blessings for granted and
[49:54] he began to forget get his identity then
[49:57] he heard a certain
[50:16] sound ooh look at that Joy let's take
[50:22] that not good when Israelites have too
[50:24] much of that especially around
[50:27] others yeah it makes him feel Invincible
[50:30] never let that happen let's take his
[50:33] pieace as well let his children think
[50:36] it's not for them we're in charge
[50:52] now one year later shanga looks around
[50:55] and begins to feel Joy coming back peace
[50:58] has re-entered his home he is once again
[51:01] beginning to live ply in his position
[51:03] for shanga things are beginning to look
[51:05] up just then shanga Hears A Familiar

[51:47] Christian more for us to enjoy but this
[51:51] time we'll take your daughter

[52:15] one year later shanga feels he has
[52:17] pieced things back together the best he
[52:19] can but he is deeply SED with his
[52:21] daughter in the world his wife's eyes
[52:23] show the weary sorrow of one who's been
[52:25] robbed time and time
[52:40] again right soldiers we must be careful
[52:43] these Israelites stick together and make
[52:46] them

[53:44] family from a few years ago he's still
[53:46] in his land he's still faithful in
[53:48] church but in his words life has been
[53:50] hard on him he walks all year round and
[53:52] finally at Camp he gets a crop that will
[53:54] Sur fight them through The Long Winter
[53:56] coming he begins to feel the victory
[53:58] with joy and peace coming close once
[54:01] again right soldiers I know it has been

[1:11:04] a neck a muscle on my neck you know so
[1:11:06] anyway yep so I'm not looking at you
[1:11:09] funny it's just hey age or something I
[1:11:11] think someone told me you know any who
[1:11:14] Mark 7:36 and 37 we'll read this oh yeah
[1:11:17] I can do this can't I amen and he and he
[1:11:20] charged them this is this is uh the Lord
[1:11:22] Jesus charg them they should tell no man
[1:11:25] but the more he charged them so much
[1:11:26] more a great so much the more a great
[1:11:29] deal they published it and we're beyond
[1:11:31] measure astonished saying he hath done
[1:11:35] all things well he maketh both the de to
[1:11:39] hear and the dumb to speak so I just
[1:11:41] want to take that phrase he hath done
[1:11:44] all things well amen and I can put it as
[1:11:47] a question has he not done all things
[1:11:49] well has he not done what he promised he
[1:11:51] would do but you see the pro and we put
[1:11:54] ourselves in the picture and get
[1:11:55] frustrated at God doing things well

[1:12:08] Your
[1:12:09] Grace we're no longer slaves to fear
[1:12:12] we're no longer slaves to unbelief we're
[1:12:14] no longer slaves to sin but we are your
[1:12:17] love prisoners Lord God we are your
[1:12:19] children we're so thankful we can be
[1:12:20] gathered on this night Lord and I pray
[1:12:22] father read your word may you the great
[1:12:24] author step forth and Speak Lord Jesus
[1:12:27] may you have the preeminence for this
[1:12:29] final moment of the Year dear God as we
[1:12:31] come here to worship and thank you for
[1:12:33] all you have done because you have done
[1:12:35] all things well Lord you've done great
[1:12:37] things Lord this year in our lives and
[1:12:39] we thank you Father for every testimony
[1:12:41] you've given us dear God we pray you'll
[1:12:43] just take the service Under Your Divine
[1:12:45] control may be with those who couldn't
[1:12:47] make it tonight because of sickness dear
[1:12:49] God father there's many who are away
[1:12:51] because of that Lord I pray you'd be
[1:12:52] their portion tonight tonight we love
[1:12:54] you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's
[1:12:56] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[1:12:59] can have your seats tonight I just want
[1:13:00] to ask you that question I'm going to
[1:13:02] ask it a lot has he not done all things
[1:13:04] well it's so important that we don't
[1:13:06] inject our own thoughts into what God
[1:13:08] has prophesied to do because when we
[1:13:11] when we inject our own selves that's
[1:13:13] when unbelief can step in and take over
[1:13:15] and God has done so many things we must
[1:13:18] be very careful to stick with all that
[1:13:20] God has promised to do now it's very
[1:13:22] interesting when you look at we're just
[1:13:24] going to go through the um uh just a few
[1:13:26] examples here but you know there's one
[1:13:28] one particular one you know it's amazing
[1:13:30] how when God will speak something and if
[1:13:33] we interpret it differently to our God
[1:13:35] will interpret it people will get
[1:13:36] frustrated they'll get annoyed at God
[1:13:39] unbelief will rise and they'll just spit
[1:13:41] the dummy out they'll throw the toys out
[1:13:42] of the cck but God's right on schedule
[1:13:45] but if we put our own thoughts into it
[1:13:48] that's when God's whole everything he's
[1:13:49] done can be just be brought to almost
[1:13:51] nothing because we have put ourselves
[1:13:53] eles in the picture so I just want to
[1:13:55] ask you the question has he not done all
[1:13:57] things well and will he not continue to
[1:13:59] do all things well because just as the
[1:14:01] devil's the creature of habit so is our
[1:14:03] God a creature of habit where he does
[1:14:05] all things well he he's done all things
[1:14:08] well from the beginning he does all
[1:14:09] things well today he'll do all things
[1:14:11] well in 2024 he's going to keep doing
[1:14:13] all things well now we're reading here
[1:14:15] just from Luke just going to you want to
[1:14:17] read with me he says so so this is where
[1:14:19] Zechariah he's standing in the temple
[1:14:21] the angel Gabriel comes and speaks to
[1:14:23] him and and and and he's here to
[1:14:25] announce that the uh you that uh John is
[1:14:27] going to be uh his son he's going to be
[1:14:29] the Forerunner all these things that
[1:14:31] thou mightest know the certainty of
[1:14:33] those things wherein thou Hast been
[1:14:34] instructed this is Luke now speaking
[1:14:37] here here was in the days of Herod the
[1:14:39] king of Judah a certain priest named
[1:14:41] Zacharias of the course of uh ABIA and
[1:14:44] his wife was of the daughters of Aaron
[1:14:45] and her name was Elizabeth and they were
[1:14:48] both righteous before God walking all
[1:14:50] the Commandments and ordinance of the
[1:14:51] Lord blameless and they they had no
[1:14:53] children because Elizabeth was Barren
[1:14:56] and they were um and they both were now
[1:14:58] well stricken in years and it came to
[1:15:01] pass that while he executed the priest's
[1:15:03] office before God in uh in the order of
[1:15:05] his course according to the custom of
[1:15:07] the priest's office his lot was to burn
[1:15:09] incense when he went into the Temple of
[1:15:11] the Lord and the whole multitude of the
[1:15:14] people were praying without at the time
[1:15:16] of incense and there appeared unto him
[1:15:18] an angel of the Lord standing on the
[1:15:20] right side of the altar of incense and
[1:15:22] when Zachariah saw him he was troubled
[1:15:24] and fear fell upon him but the angel
[1:15:26] said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy
[1:15:28] prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth
[1:15:31] shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
[1:15:33] call his name John how long have they
[1:15:36] been praying for a
[1:15:38] child now they had come to a stage of
[1:15:40] life where they thought it's impossible
[1:15:42] but it's amazing how when we pray for
[1:15:44] things God will answer in his time
[1:15:46] according to his season not our schedule
[1:15:49] God doesn't work by our program as
[1:15:51] brother am would say at the closing of a
[1:15:52] new year I mean end of a year he'd say
[1:15:55] may we see Jesus and his program it's so
[1:15:58] important we see Jesus and his program
[1:16:01] because it's one thing just to see the
[1:16:02] Lord but you got to see him and his
[1:16:04] program because if you see his program
[1:16:06] he can line up with his program which is
[1:16:08] his word and it doesn't matter what
[1:16:10] happens you won't be offended amen right
[1:16:13] so he heard so so the Lord had heard his
[1:16:16] prayers but no doubt Zacharias and and
[1:16:19] Elizabeth thought well I guess God did
[1:16:22] not is not going to answer our prayer
[1:16:24] let's not put a full stop on what we
[1:16:25] think God's going to do now amen God can
[1:16:27] do the exceedingly abundantly more than
[1:16:29] we ask or can think right amen let's not
[1:16:32] put God in a box am mean I pray 2024 is
[1:16:34] a God we serve a god that is not in a
[1:16:37] box in our own lives he won't be bound
[1:16:39] he's moved through church ages moved
[1:16:41] through movements all these things as
[1:16:42] soon as man puts God in a box he moves
[1:16:44] on let's not be those kind of a people
[1:16:46] amen let's let God be God and let us be
[1:16:49] us and let God be God right and do what
[1:16:51] he wants to do so amen and thou shalt
[1:16:54] have joy and gladness and many shall
[1:16:56] rejoice at his birth for he shall be
[1:16:58] great in the sight of the Lord and shall
[1:17:00] drink neither strong uh neither wine nor
[1:17:02] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[1:17:04] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[1:17:06] womb and many of the children of Israel
[1:17:09] shall he turn to the Lord their God and
[1:17:11] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:17:13] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:17:15] fathers to the children and the
[1:17:17] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:17:18] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:17:21] Lord and Zachariah said un to the angel
[1:17:23] whereby shall I know this for I'm an old
[1:17:26] man and my wife well stricken in years
[1:17:29] amen now I didn't put verse 19 in here
[1:17:31] for some reason um but hey we can just
[1:17:34] find that
[1:17:36] here where are we oh maybe we're in Luke
[1:17:40] come in Mark let's just let's just let's
[1:17:42] just get this here cuz I don't know why
[1:17:43] I missed it but hey so we're in Luke
[1:17:45] chapter 1 and we are
[1:17:48] verse 19 no we're
[1:17:51] not trust you don't mind the technical
[1:17:54] technical difficulty this uh this
[1:17:55] evening now and the angel answered said
[1:17:58] unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the
[1:18:00] presence of God and and sent to speak
[1:18:01] unto thee and to show thee these Glad
[1:18:04] Tidings amen all right so this is who's
[1:18:07] speaking to them not just anyone else
[1:18:09] right and behold Thou shalt be dumb and
[1:18:11] not be able to speak until the day that
[1:18:13] these things shall be performed because
[1:18:15] thou believest not my words which shall
[1:18:17] be fulfilled in this season now I want
[1:18:19] you to just there's quite a few things
[1:18:21] in here I'm going to you I made a to
[1:18:23] them but one of them is that the a the
[1:18:24] words of the Angel shall be fulfilled in
[1:18:27] their season not in your season not in
[1:18:30] my season yeah in God's season right so
[1:18:34] the the words of the seventh angel will
[1:18:36] be performed in their season
[1:18:39] amen okay and behold yes and the and the
[1:18:43] people waited for Zacharias and Marvel
[1:18:45] that he carried so long in the temple
[1:18:47] and when he came out he could not speak
[1:18:48] unto them and they perceived that he had
[1:18:50] seen a vision in the temple for he
[1:18:52] Beacon under to them and remained
[1:18:53] speechless and it came to pass that as
[1:18:56] soon as the days of his ministration
[1:18:57] were accomplished he departed to his own
[1:18:59] house and after those days his wife
[1:19:02] Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five
[1:19:05] months saying thus hath the Lord dealt
[1:19:07] with me in the days dur and he looked on
[1:19:09] me to take away my reproach among men
[1:19:13] now we're just going to jump down in the
[1:19:14] story where where the same Angel Gabriel
[1:19:16] speaks to Mary and with God nothing
[1:19:18] shall be impossible and Mary said behold
[1:19:20] the handmade of the Lord be unto me
[1:19:23] according to Thy word and the angel
[1:19:24] departed from her and Mary arose in
[1:19:26] those days and went into the Hill
[1:19:27] Country with haste into a city of Judea
[1:19:30] and entered into the house of Zacharias
[1:19:32] and saluted Elizabeth and it came to
[1:19:34] pass that when Elizabeth heard the
[1:19:35] salutation of Mary The Babe leapt in her
[1:19:37] womb and Elizabeth was filled with the
[1:19:39] Holy Ghost now Elizabeth's fulltime came
[1:19:42] that she should be delivered and she
[1:19:43] brought forth a son now we're going to
[1:19:46] con and her neighbors and her cousins
[1:19:48] heard how the Lord had showed great
[1:19:49] mercy upon her and they rejoiced with
[1:19:52] her now we're going to jump back to this
[1:19:55] but but here's a question there's quite
[1:19:57] a few things that the angel said would
[1:19:59] be fulfilled now as soon as the angel
[1:20:01] said it now here comes the time scale
[1:20:03] number one you know if I find my if I
[1:20:05] find my list here this is not an order
[1:20:07] but Zacharias was promised numerous
[1:20:09] things as part of the same promise he
[1:20:11] wouldn't be able to speak that happened
[1:20:13] straight away uh until a son be born so
[1:20:15] that's the end of the of the whole thing
[1:20:17] before his son is born uh his son will
[1:20:20] receive the Holy Ghost in his mother's
[1:20:22] womb that puts a time scale on things
[1:20:24] okay so now his son is going to be the
[1:20:27] Forerunner of the Messiah his name is
[1:20:29] going to be called John and he'll be
[1:20:31] able to speak again so all of these
[1:20:33] promises are from the same Angel giving
[1:20:36] all these promises now what would happen
[1:20:40] if John put his interpretation into this
[1:20:42] list and said well as soon as John is
[1:20:45] born or you know zachari put his
[1:20:47] interpretation on this list well as soon
[1:20:49] as John is born I'm going to be able to
[1:20:50] speak again oh boy
[1:20:53] he would stay in unbelief and stay
[1:20:56] dumb because it wasn't see if he had
[1:20:59] that in his mind well as soon as his son
[1:21:00] is born my tongue's going to be loosed
[1:21:02] I'm going to praise God but you see that
[1:21:04] was his season that was his thinking it
[1:21:06] wasn't God's thinking see what happens
[1:21:09] is God can fulfill so many
[1:21:12] promises Elizabeth was with child there
[1:21:14] one prom well first one he couldn't
[1:21:16] speak that's one promise number two he
[1:21:18] Elizabeth was was with child that's the
[1:21:20] second promise third promise is John
[1:21:22] received the ghost in his mother's womb
[1:21:24] that's the third promise fourth promise
[1:21:26] is he's born right say all these
[1:21:28] promises that God has given but what if
[1:21:30] John spat the dummy just using uh you
[1:21:33] know that kind of term and got angry and
[1:21:35] frustrated at God if when he was soon as
[1:21:38] was born he couldn't speak see and this
[1:21:41] is what people do has God not done all
[1:21:43] things well and they begin to doubt what
[1:21:46] God is about to do in their lives and if
[1:21:48] you let unbelief take you over that
[1:21:50] thing will not happen yeah but has has
[1:21:52] not God done all things well amen has he
[1:21:54] not called you from a life of sin has he
[1:21:56] not brought you out of Darkness has he
[1:21:59] not saved you has he not washed you has
[1:22:02] he not filled you with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:04] has he not baptized you amen has he not
[1:22:06] walked with you has he not guided you
[1:22:09] has he not kept you from falling has he
[1:22:11] not kept you from many dangerous toils
[1:22:13] and snares even this last year God has
[1:22:16] kept us from many dangers this world is
[1:22:18] in a Free Fall Into Darkness why aren't
[1:22:20] you going with it cuz God unfailing hand
[1:22:23] says I'm not going to let these ones
[1:22:25] fall I'm going to hold them and sustain
[1:22:27] them and keep them amen from falling
[1:22:30] thank you Lord has he not done these
[1:22:31] things oh yes then why do we doubt him
[1:22:33] with everything else he's promised why
[1:22:35] do he say he cannot do it he's done all
[1:22:37] these things see people think well my
[1:22:38] problem is too hard no one understands R
[1:22:41] I've Bean it's impossible Jesus went to
[1:22:45] hell with one scripture he knew is going
[1:22:47] to come out of the grave and that
[1:22:49] scripture was I'll not I'll not suffer
[1:22:51] my Holy One to see corruption will not
[1:22:52] leave his soul in Hell by that one
[1:22:54] Revelation he had in his heart he knew
[1:22:56] that he was going to die but he was
[1:22:57] going to come back to life again amen he
[1:23:00] went to the worst place in existence for
[1:23:04] you and you think you've got a problem
[1:23:07] he carried your sin my sin all of our
[1:23:09] sin all the sin of the world up Calvary
[1:23:11] he died he's forsaken he says my God my
[1:23:15] God why is Thou forsaken me amen when he
[1:23:18] was in Gethsemane sweating it out it was
[1:23:20] Drops of blood falling cuz he was in Ang
[1:23:22] cuz he knew exactly what he was going
[1:23:25] through he saw it by Vision he knew he's
[1:23:28] going to be beaten he's going to be M
[1:23:29] more than any other man he's going to
[1:23:31] his his bones are going to be out of
[1:23:32] joint all these things are going to
[1:23:34] happen to him and he stepped into it
[1:23:36] gladly for you and you think you have a
[1:23:39] bad day and you think you've got trouble
[1:23:41] and you know we're going to put things
[1:23:43] in
[1:23:45] perspective Jesus went with faith into
[1:23:47] that and came out the other side Glory
[1:23:51] Paul said the life are I live I live by
[1:23:53] the faith of the Son of God so if Jesus
[1:23:56] could walk into hell with that faith can
[1:23:58] we not walk through Satan's Eden with
[1:24:01] that same faith and go to a Rapture can
[1:24:02] we not if his faith overcame hell death
[1:24:05] in the grave and all the hordes of hell
[1:24:07] don't you think that faith and you can
[1:24:09] operate the same way and do the same
[1:24:10] things and overcome the same
[1:24:12] problems I believe it can that's why
[1:24:15] we're standing today I may be shouting
[1:24:18] but I'm very happy because I look back
[1:24:20] at a year I say that wasn't all the
[1:24:22] failes was me but all the victory was
[1:24:24] God Amen all the overcoming was not me
[1:24:27] it was him and the reason we're still
[1:24:29] Believers today is not because of us and
[1:24:31] what we think we are it's who he is is
[1:24:34] the reason we're Believers today the
[1:24:35] reason we're overcoming today still have
[1:24:37] faith in this word is because of him not
[1:24:40] ourselves amen so I think you know we
[1:24:43] should never ever inject our own
[1:24:45] thoughts and say well God can't do it
[1:24:48] that's right God's going to take a
[1:24:50] people off the Earth they're going to be
[1:24:52] old they're going to be young they're
[1:24:53] going to be teenage going to be young
[1:24:55] people they're going to be elderly
[1:24:56] they're going to be all different ages
[1:24:58] he's going to transform their bodies
[1:25:00] amen amen I believe it amen is there
[1:25:03] anything too hard for the Lord no but
[1:25:05] people say well you don't understand and
[1:25:06] I just need no we need God we need God
[1:25:09] and one another we need to gather more
[1:25:12] together we need to see the fire of God
[1:25:14] move we need to put our problems you
[1:25:16] know I've been to places and I hear
[1:25:18] people just talk about their complexes
[1:25:19] all the time and but they believer but
[1:25:22] they talk about their complex and I
[1:25:23] think well what are they worshiping in
[1:25:25] this place are they worshiping their
[1:25:27] humanity and their complexes and their
[1:25:28] problems or they worshiping God I think
[1:25:31] we should make our problems very small
[1:25:33] and make our God very big am mean we
[1:25:35] should make him the biggest cuz he is
[1:25:37] the biggest my daddy's bigger than all
[1:25:39] the daddies Hallelujah he can beat up
[1:25:41] all the daddies I mean he already beat
[1:25:43] them up when he conquered hell death in
[1:25:45] the grave you know what I mean so we
[1:25:47] should never exalt our problems amen
[1:25:51] because if we exalt our problem problems
[1:25:52] will get
[1:25:53] offended come on now that's true you
[1:25:56] know Jesus would say you blind guide you
[1:25:58] strain at a net and swallow a camel and
[1:26:01] that strain means to filter out you
[1:26:03] filter out the smallest thing you think
[1:26:05] is wrong and this is what happens people
[1:26:08] get a blindness on them and they and
[1:26:10] they and they strain out a little thing
[1:26:12] that they're not happy with a little net
[1:26:14] but yet they'll swallow up this world
[1:26:17] they'll gulp it down by the by the
[1:26:19] screen load or by the airwave load you
[1:26:22] know they'll gulp it down but they'll
[1:26:23] strain out this little thing that they
[1:26:25] the things we don't like is cuz we're
[1:26:26] not willing to die we're not willing to
[1:26:28] surrender that's the things people
[1:26:30] strain out they're not willing to allow
[1:26:32] those things to like Brother Andy says
[1:26:34] if the flesh Burns let it burn if you
[1:26:36] feel uncomfortable let it burn let God
[1:26:38] burn it out of you amen I think that's a
[1:26:40] good way to look at things amen so so we
[1:26:42] don't want to get into this place CU
[1:26:43] what happens is when you strain at the
[1:26:45] small things you get
[1:26:48] offended Jesus spoke a lot about getting
[1:26:51] offended
[1:26:52] he said blessed is he whom is not
[1:26:55] offended in me or I can put it a
[1:26:57] different way blessed is he who's not
[1:26:59] offended in how I fulfill my word in
[1:27:02] your life amen see it's very easy say
[1:27:04] yes we're going in a Rapture yes this is
[1:27:06] all these things happening what happens
[1:27:08] when it comes down to your life my life
[1:27:10] Wow blessed is he who opens the cupboard
[1:27:13] and is not offended that it's empty
[1:27:15] blessed is he that looks at the bank
[1:27:16] account and doesn't get offended cuz
[1:27:18] it's just a bunch of zeros and maybe a
[1:27:20] negative in front of it I don't know
[1:27:22] yeah blessed is he when he Praises
[1:27:25] something and it goes sideways and he
[1:27:27] doesn't get mad he Praises God
[1:27:29] anyhow we should never be offended yes
[1:27:32] sir with how God how God fulfills his
[1:27:34] word he's in the business of fulfilling
[1:27:36] his word we're in the business of
[1:27:38] surrendering to his will that his word
[1:27:40] is fulfilled
[1:27:42] amen abolutely he said this in Matthew
[1:27:44] 11 I don't have the whole thing up there
[1:27:46] but he said this to John's disciples
[1:27:49] John was in prison he was getting
[1:27:51] offended all right because he'
[1:27:52] introduced the Messiah he had the story
[1:27:55] of his parents of his peculiar birth and
[1:27:58] everything that happened there and he
[1:27:59] knew he is different because and and and
[1:28:02] and the reason he knew he is different
[1:28:03] because his mother said when when when
[1:28:05] Mary who was carrying the Messiah came
[1:28:07] my way and spoke Jesus is name to me you
[1:28:10] got filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:28:11] your testimony he thought this is why
[1:28:13] God's with me but then when he fulfilled
[1:28:16] his mission on Earth and he was in a
[1:28:19] prison yeah he got offended because he
[1:28:22] didn't think it would have ended up that
[1:28:23] way Lord hallelujah he got offended we
[1:28:26] shouldn't get offended how God fulfills
[1:28:28] his word I have no idea what 24 is going
[1:28:30] to bring us we could be
[1:28:33] gone who knows the world could collapse
[1:28:37] yes whatever happens praise God can we
[1:28:40] actually have the faith and trust in God
[1:28:42] to say Lord whatever you want for my
[1:28:44] life whatever happens if sickness
[1:28:46] strikes my family if trouble strikes my
[1:28:49] family if hardship strikes my family I
[1:28:51] walk with with you in it Lord I'll walk
[1:28:53] with you in the trouble I'll walk with
[1:28:54] you in the sickness Lord are we willing
[1:28:57] I pray we are I believe I'm looking at a
[1:28:59] people prise the Lord he said I want to
[1:29:01] go dancing out of this place we we might
[1:29:03] dance later but if you're if you're
[1:29:05] blessed if you're not offended in how
[1:29:07] God fulfill his word you're very
[1:29:11] blessed because even look at this this
[1:29:13] is the disciples Jesus here before they
[1:29:15] go to the Garden of Gethsemane this
[1:29:17] Matthew 26 here then saith Jesus unto
[1:29:19] them all ye shall be offended because of
[1:29:22] me this night for it is written you're
[1:29:25] going to be offended because this
[1:29:27] scripture is going to be fulfilled in
[1:29:29] you I will Smite the sheeper and the and
[1:29:31] the sheep of the flock shall be
[1:29:32] scattered abroad but after I am risen
[1:29:35] again I'll go before you into Galilee he
[1:29:38] told them he was going to be crucified
[1:29:40] he told them he was going to raise the
[1:29:41] third day he told this to them numerous
[1:29:43] times but in the Fulfillment there was
[1:29:45] an offense for
[1:29:47] them and Peter said I'm never going to
[1:29:50] be offended you can't offend me Lord
[1:29:53] doesn't matter what you send me through
[1:29:54] I'm just going to coaster it cuz I'm
[1:29:55] just made of this kind of stuff he
[1:29:57] realized his Humanity wasn't built come
[1:30:00] on to to not be offended in the word
[1:30:02] being fulfilled right but when you get
[1:30:04] the Holy Ghost is a different story
[1:30:06] amen amen now this word offended it's
[1:30:10] actually uh a scandal this is the root
[1:30:13] word it's a scandal it's a a trap stick
[1:30:17] which is bent like a bent sapling it's a
[1:30:20] snare figuratively a cause of
[1:30:22] displeasure or sin sometimes how the
[1:30:25] words fulfill can actually displease
[1:30:28] us that's right I'll say amen for
[1:30:31] everyone sometimes we're like Lord why
[1:30:33] is my life going this way and it's the
[1:30:35] perfect will of God it's exactly where
[1:30:37] he wants you to go and you're thinking
[1:30:40] Lord do I have
[1:30:42] to yes if we had our way let's let's
[1:30:46] just be real honest if we had our way
[1:30:49] would you have wanted any of the trials
[1:30:51] you have had even this last
[1:30:55] year but we want God's way amen us we
[1:30:58] don't want our way Satan wants his way
[1:31:00] to be Antichrist is to want your own way
[1:31:02] so let's not be Antichrist it's an
[1:31:05] occasion to fall of stumbling it's an
[1:31:07] offense it's a thing that offends a
[1:31:09] stumbling block and how we can sadly see
[1:31:13] when the word is fulfilled it can
[1:31:15] stumble it can offend Believers amen we
[1:31:19] don't want to be like that
[1:31:23] brother says in the forgotten beatitude
[1:31:25] I won't be too much longer oh my and
[1:31:26] blessed is he who's not offended in me
[1:31:28] now don't be offended I believe that
[1:31:30] there's more people offended in Jesus
[1:31:32] than any other person that ever lived on
[1:31:34] earth they get offended too quick Jesus
[1:31:37] now in this misplaced beatitude slipped
[1:31:39] over here so we could get it tonight why
[1:31:41] he said blessed is he who's not offended
[1:31:43] in me don't be offended then the more
[1:31:46] that takes place everything's working
[1:31:49] right on schedule yes so you just go
[1:31:52] ahead and believe it that's all
[1:31:54] everything's all right just go ahead and
[1:31:57] believe
[1:31:58] it I like that everything's right on
[1:32:01] schedule it's right on budget
[1:32:04] everything's performing Just Right In
[1:32:06] God's economy we just got to go in and
[1:32:08] believe his word not to get
[1:32:12] offended amen see it's the
[1:32:15] Fulfillment we get offended and the
[1:32:18] Israelites when they came out of Egypt
[1:32:20] they at the Red Sea and they're asking
[1:32:22] Moses because there's no graves in Egypt
[1:32:25] h has thou taken us away to die in the
[1:32:29] wilderness they have they became
[1:32:31] offended because their enemy was behind
[1:32:33] them the Red Sea was in front of them
[1:32:36] and they were going to see they were
[1:32:37] about to see the greatest hand of
[1:32:39] Deliverance that God had ever done they
[1:32:41] weren't offended at the 10 plagues or
[1:32:43] how many plagues there were in Egypt
[1:32:45] right but it was this time they begin to
[1:32:47] get offended it's because God was
[1:32:49] wanting to take them on a faith walk all
[1:32:51] the word brought them out but they had
[1:32:54] to have faith mix that word with faith
[1:32:56] now and start walking with the Lord but
[1:32:59] those those that God offended thought
[1:33:01] well you've just brought us out here to
[1:33:03] die but you see they forgot to remember
[1:33:08] what God had promised them to
[1:33:11] do he says I come down this is verse
[1:33:13] eight this is the Lord speaking to Moses
[1:33:15] I've come them to deliver them
[1:33:17] out there's no offense in that the 10
[1:33:20] plagues will have many out of the hand
[1:33:22] of the Egyptians and to bring them out
[1:33:24] of that land unto a good land and a
[1:33:26] large unto a land flowing with milk and
[1:33:28] honey so the people who got offended did
[1:33:32] not believe that God his whole promise
[1:33:35] he had brought them out they weren't in
[1:33:36] Egypt anymore they weren't in Goan
[1:33:38] anymore they were standing on the bank
[1:33:39] of the Red Sea they were there but then
[1:33:42] they got offended because they thought
[1:33:43] now we're just going to get massacred
[1:33:45] they misunderstood how God wanted to
[1:33:47] deliver them we don't want to
[1:33:50] misunderstand you know brother Braham
[1:33:52] says that that Saul before he became
[1:33:54] Paul how he persecuted the church was a
[1:33:56] man under conviction yeah after stoning
[1:34:00] you know consenting to see Stephen
[1:34:01] stoned all these things it was a man
[1:34:03] under conviction and we see God actually
[1:34:06] trouble begins to stir it at home it's
[1:34:09] actually God bringing someone under
[1:34:11] conviction and we get upset thinking
[1:34:14] Lord I'm praying for this but you're
[1:34:16] giving me this what do we do we get
[1:34:18] offended at God is actually answering
[1:34:20] prayer you may agree with me but this is
[1:34:22] what it is brother R said a man under
[1:34:24] conviction is like Saul before he met
[1:34:26] the Lord on the road to Damascus so you
[1:34:28] see someone in a family start acting up
[1:34:29] in Pride and selfishness and trouble and
[1:34:31] me me me and all these kind of things
[1:34:33] it's someone under conviction and
[1:34:36] instead of praising
[1:34:38] God come on thank you
[1:34:45] Jesus Glory you know you just had the
[1:34:48] worst meal of the dinner table ever
[1:34:50] someone just blew up and if they could
[1:34:51] they would have flipped the table in
[1:34:52] your face what do we do oh poor is me oh
[1:34:56] no God's not here he's not answering my
[1:34:59] prayers the devil's on the rampage this
[1:35:01] problem so big and God's actually got
[1:35:04] someone under conviction you got to
[1:35:06] allow them to stand under
[1:35:08] conviction someone some of you are
[1:35:10] looking at me real funny but you got to
[1:35:12] look at things differently
[1:35:15] yeah oh yeah instead of saying
[1:35:17] hallelujah thank you Lord you're dealing
[1:35:20] in my family sure that was a terrible
[1:35:22] time I'd never want to be in the
[1:35:23] atmosphere again because you all that
[1:35:25] trouble that got but actually we' say
[1:35:27] thank you Lord like if they just knew
[1:35:29] that their task Masters that were behind
[1:35:31] them were going to be drowned and they
[1:35:33] were going to do a victory dance on the
[1:35:34] other side of the Red Sea they wouldn't
[1:35:36] have been complaining yeah they wouldn't
[1:35:38] have been saying this they would say
[1:35:41] Moses glory amen you see that guy in
[1:35:45] that Chariot he beat me a lot he's going
[1:35:47] to drown in there I'm walking through
[1:35:49] there he's going to drown in there
[1:35:51] Hallelujah Miriam have you got your
[1:35:53] dancing shoes on have you got your
[1:35:54] tambourine ready Miriam Hallelujah
[1:35:58] because tomorrow we're dancing tomorrow
[1:36:00] they're dead but tomorrow we're dancing
[1:36:02] amen hallelujah but what do we do we do
[1:36:04] like this oh it can't work the promise
[1:36:08] isn't for me God's forsaken me the
[1:36:10] problem's too big the problem's too hard
[1:36:13] I can't get through this I just need me
[1:36:15] time God doesn't work God always works
[1:36:18] amen those people's attitudes and what
[1:36:20] is it it's unbeliev speaking Yeah the
[1:36:23] world has a lot of sin preaching and
[1:36:26] unbelief speaking sin is unbelief why
[1:36:29] don't we speak some Faith amen why don't
[1:36:31] we speak some Faith around the dinner
[1:36:33] table speak some Faith around in our
[1:36:35] conversations amen Caleb and Joshua said
[1:36:37] let's go take the mountain amen why
[1:36:40] because they believe that God would do
[1:36:42] the whole promise if he did the first
[1:36:44] part he's going to do the second part he
[1:36:47] doesn't do one part and say oh yeah that
[1:36:48] was fun I'll go to do something else no
[1:36:50] he fulfills his whole word but do we
[1:36:53] have faith that God can do his whole
[1:36:55] word amen yes amen so we don't want to
[1:36:59] be
[1:37:00] offended when trouble strikes all we
[1:37:04] don't want to be offended but you see
[1:37:06] now it was eight days the child was born
[1:37:10] for eight days but Zacharias said if God
[1:37:14] basically said in his heart God you done
[1:37:16] all these
[1:37:17] things my I can't speak my wife is
[1:37:20] pregnant my our son received the Holy
[1:37:22] Ghost in her womb all these things have
[1:37:24] happened you're going to loose my tongue
[1:37:27] in the right time I know I said it
[1:37:30] before but what if he said as soon as
[1:37:31] the baby's born well I'm dumb and I God
[1:37:33] said you know I'd speak but I can't
[1:37:35] speak he's wrong what's the point of
[1:37:36] serving this God yes we can't have that
[1:37:39] attitude it was 8 Days 8 days after the
[1:37:42] child was born but you see zacharias's
[1:37:46] confession had to match what the angel
[1:37:48] what the word said that's why as soon as
[1:37:51] he he was given the writing tablet
[1:37:53] because they said let's call him his
[1:37:55] name should be Zacharias and Elizabeth
[1:37:56] said no his name should be called John
[1:37:58] they saying but none of your family's
[1:38:00] name that way and but then they made
[1:38:02] signs to his father and and you know
[1:38:03] called him he took up the writing tablet
[1:38:05] and he inscribed in Hebrew his name is
[1:38:09] John what his confession matched what
[1:38:12] the angel said and as soon as his
[1:38:14] confession matched the word amen the
[1:38:16] miraculous took place in his life amen
[1:38:18] and that's what we've got to have when
[1:38:20] our confession
[1:38:21] matches what the what God has promised
[1:38:24] us in this day of Shamar manifested in
[1:38:28] our homes amen of the devil being kicked
[1:38:30] out restoration of Life sickness being
[1:38:33] driven out demon powers being cast out
[1:38:36] the Holy Ghost being poured out amen
[1:38:39] when we confess what the angel has said
[1:38:42] then the miraculous miraculous will take
[1:38:44] place amen who wants that who wants that
[1:38:48] this year amen that that that may our
[1:38:50] confession be the word hallelujah then
[1:38:53] what happened and his mouth was opened
[1:38:55] immediately and his tongue loosed and he
[1:38:58] spake and he praised God it was more
[1:39:00] than just a mental thing his name was
[1:39:02] John it was from it was a revelation why
[1:39:04] cuz he no doubt he took stock I was made
[1:39:07] an angel met me and Angels met you God
[1:39:10] met you amen if you're a real believer
[1:39:13] God met you a church didn't meet you a
[1:39:16] religion didn't meet you Jesus Christ
[1:39:18] met you he stepped out of history and
[1:39:19] met you and then be to make some
[1:39:21] promises amen come unto me all you that
[1:39:24] are heavy labor your heavy laden I'll
[1:39:26] bring give you rest who's received that
[1:39:28] rest who's been transformed by the power
[1:39:31] of the Holy Ghost then will he not do
[1:39:33] everything else he said can he has he
[1:39:37] not done all things well and will he not
[1:39:41] continue to do all things well amen I
[1:39:46] pray is if if we're here another year
[1:39:49] we'll stand here and we'll give
[1:39:50] testimony said Lord you did all things
[1:39:53] well Lord you taught me this year not to
[1:39:55] inject my own thoughts into your word
[1:39:58] you taught me not to put myself in your
[1:40:00] word ahead of what you want to do but
[1:40:02] you told me to walk in harmony with the
[1:40:04] Fulfillment of your word and you
[1:40:07] fulfilled exactly what you promised to
[1:40:09] do Hallelujah that's right I pray that
[1:40:12] will be our testimony amen amen and I
[1:40:16] believe that we are a people that will
[1:40:19] see that amen God's built us that way by
