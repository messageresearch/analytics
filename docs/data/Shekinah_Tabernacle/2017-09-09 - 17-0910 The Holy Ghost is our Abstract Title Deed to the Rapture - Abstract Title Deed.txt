her brother sister when he went to Antioch I believe hallelujah anyone can decode the Bible says he saw some other believers that were worshipping they were worshiping they were worshiping even before them and he said have you received the Holy Ghost ever since you believe that's where you started you never said have you ever been baptized if you ever pay your tax no shame he said have you ever received the Holy Ghost since you believed why because the Holy Ghost is the core thing the very most important thing for a believer you can't say I a believer when you don't have the Holy Ghost hallelujah and the Holy Ghost doesn't come when you're just seated like you're over a car or when you're drinking a cup of coffee no you just there's a lot of sacrifice that comes up with it
