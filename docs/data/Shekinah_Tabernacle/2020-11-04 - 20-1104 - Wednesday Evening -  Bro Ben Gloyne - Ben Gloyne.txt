everyone out tonight amen welcome let's just turn to the scripture let's go to first samuel um amen i trust you're all ready for a evening of prayer can you please turn me down a bit here um i'm gonna go to first samuel and first samuel 16. and we're going to read verses 1 then we're going to drop down and read verses 11 213. so first samuel 16 and verse 1 and and samuel said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be psalm in 15 16. and the lord said unto samuel how long will thou mourn for saul saying i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thy horn with oil and go i'll send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons then we're going to drop down to verse 11 after you know after jesse's gone there and all the other sons have passed by and to everyone god says no no no and no doubt all of them thought i'm the one i'm the one i'm the one but god chooses the unlikely hello unlikely how are you how are you tonight amen and then we come to verse 11 and samuel said unto jesse i hear all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down until he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rama amen let's just bow heads for a word of prayer as we have just read the word lord jesus we are so thankful we can read your word and i'm so thankful it's more than a story it's more than uh even a religious book lord but it's you in print form so father i just pray lord as we've gathered this night dear god no doubt many of us had very busy first few days of the week and lord we just want to pray you come and settle our spirits down now and lord we just want to come aside into your presence this night and i just pray lord you just bring us into a channel of prayer lord may you grant it lord may you be the one that prays through us lord may it not be our humanity or love it just might be you lord we want to step aside that you just take control lord pray you bless your word as we've read it i asked lord you'd take these few thoughts and just multiply it oh god may you grant it father for your glory we thank you we can stand here as a redeemed blood washed people and lord we just want to give all honor glory and praise unto you in jesus christ's name we ask these things amen amen god bless you friends i want to um there was a statement that brother freddie made on on the friday uh evening he said he said that you know we need to experience the power of god's word he's made that statement we need to experience the power of god's word it really struck me where he didn't say we need to experience or understand the word we need to experience the power of the word very different thing to understand the word which is good we should understand it but the power in that word when it's released into a people that's a very different thing now we read here in in first samuel because david was the one ordained to experience the power of what god told samuel so the word that was given to samuel was go to jesse jesse's house i have a king among the sons that was the word but every other son that went before samuel was not ordained to experience the power of that word but there was one in the house that was and he experienced the power of that word because david was i mean jesse was sorry samuel was told that one of your jesse's sons is going to be my king so he already in him was going to be the king but when that word became flesh you know became living when when the prophet anointed him he experienced the power of that word and then he began to show the dominion the power that was because he was a king a king is in charge a king isn't the one that you know you know is is beaten down trodden down he has dominion and then now he began to experience all the days of his life after that he began to experience the power of that word so so for example he went to look after the sheep again an enemy came into his domain there was there was a lion and he and the anointing came upon him he killed the lion he experienced the power of that word and then a bigger enemy came along a bear and then he experienced the power of that word right the anointing you know made that word live in his life again and he killed the bear and then a bigger enemy came in which was goliath and you know no doubt maybe because david remember israel the rest of israel knew it could be done they knew that goliath could be killed but david it was revealed to david the prophet said that goliath was going down so really god's program ever yeah i've got the quote here from perfect strength and perfect weakness uh brother brown says that god has a strategy and and and i like this strategy he's speaking now firstly speaking of of of the day you know after the resurrection and you know you know the disciples went fishing and you know they see the lord on the on the seashore you're having bread and fish by the fire and john has a bit of an eagle vision he can say it's the lord he tells peter peter jumps in the water he swims towards the lord not knowing that that that he would he would be received or not but he went anyway and that's the best thing you know you feel wrong you feel condemned just go to the lord anyway amen that's what that's what peter did so he says here he says now he thought he was a great man speaking of peter chop the high priest son's ear off like that or whoever it was well he thought he was a great fellow you know he had learned something but he knowed nothing he had to forget all about it and there he was out there said well i know one thing i'm a fisherman i can still make a living fishing he cast all night and didn't get nothing oh what a discourage every time he pulled it up an empty net and it was so discouraged he was so discouraged he was at the weakest point he said i just might as well feel like jumping off this boat i ain't worth nothing anyhow and then he and then he heard a voice saying have you caught any fish children he looked up on the bank and and there stood a man he said no we've toiled all night taken nothing i thought i was a fisherman is that you simon yeah well i toiled all night taken nothing oh we ain't got no fish out here he said cast your net on the other side we've done what then he said oh the other side we've been doing that cast it on the other side he throwed his nets out and he pulled it he said oh then he becomes strong oh mine he grabbed up his old fish coat put it on around him brethren that's who it is he beat the rest of them to the bank before they could rowing their boats as fast as they could he outswammed them with a fish coat on got to the bank why when he was strong he couldn't do nothing but when he got weak then he got strong yes sir and he says oh god strategy you want to hear god's strategy here's god's strategy is to take an empty human vessel and shake the world with them that's god's program god's strategy take an empty human vessel you know when you when we can take our own human ability and cast it to one side because all it will do is bring discouragement like peter amen but when we when we so is to take a empty human vessel shake the world with them oh just a little bit we'll go look at pentecost at pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the world he poured himself into them hallelujah and he's the same yesterday today and forever i mean that's what we need today that's what we need is empty vessels yes sir so god can fill them up hallelujah see peter peter saw a lot of things the lord did he was even anointed to cast out devils heal the sick but he still had not experienced the power of god's word because the power of god's word for that season was terry in jerusalem and i'm going to fill you with myself and shake the world you'll be endured with on power from on high hallelujah so david david came down and he and he faced goliath remember he was a king he was a little boy but he was a king that was the main thing it doesn't matter how big you are how old you are if you're anointed hallelujah if the word is living through you that's the main thing and he just looked and you know saul saul was head and shoulders above the rest of israel he was the one physically who could have done the job but you know he was shaking in his boots backslidden king in his tent a little shepherd boy comes and begins to testify of killing a lion and a bear and he just put you know god's healed once he'll heal again he delivered once he'll he'll deliver again demon power got cast out here the same one will be cast out in the same way hallelujah that enemy that came against us before we're going to beat this one as well amen that's what that's what david said well the lion and the bear and goliath just in the same category amen say you know hallelujah so god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and fill them with themselves and shake the world hallelujah so here comes david goliath makes this boast david just tells him what's going to happen we don't need to make a boast or paint up a big picture this is just how it's going to be i'm going to cut your head off he says he didn't even have a sword but goliath had carried his own sword hallelujah and then no doubt he begins to whirl the swing i mean whirl the sling around and it's the last it's the last noise that goliath ever hears and he and then and then god annoys that stone and goes straight to the killing place why because a king was anointed and he was experiencing the power of god's word for his life now we are the bride of christ we're more than an earthly king right david was we know he represents christ coming into power but he also represents a church coming into power right so even in david's life you should be able to see yourself but so but we must understand that was just a shadow pointing to a reality and now we are on this side of calvary the reality so his life that he was living was pointing to a people in the end time hello people at the end time how we're doing so so he had a dominion remember he experienced a word and that word was going to take him to the throne that word was going to help him overcome his enemies that word would even help overcome himself hallelujah how did he overcome himself when god anointed the prophet nathan or whoever it was to point out his sin he was quick to acknowledge that he was wrong and he repented amen that's that's someone that's really going to overcome when we can take ownership of the things we do and say lord we're wrong forgive me lord hallelujah that's a victorious believer glory hallelujah he didn't try and patch it up when you know when god put his finger it was about apparently two years after the deed to where nathan walked into the throne room maybe he thought it was all done and dusted oh boy i know not in god's telly book hey ben but we are more than just an earthly king we're under a word the bride is experiencing the word of god's power the power of god's word when this book came open it told you a few things it told you your your real identity right as we heard at camp we're not from new zealand we're not from wherever you're from we're not from that place that's where we started our earthly journey but our journey started in the mind of god right and we began to find out as the word came open to us that we are from god we're going back to god hallelujah that god is in control of our lives and we're we're living under a prophecy just like mary was the one who was ordained to be the one that would bring jesus to the earth to actually you know birth his natural body no one else was qualified to do the job in terms of in god's mind when god anointed isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he knew exactly who was going to be he knew where she would be knew her age knew where she was living knew exactly when the angel gabriel would come and speak to her all the events of her life were planned out already but it was just carried in that little word a virgin shall conceive and a lot of you know brother braham said a lot of devout israelites you know when they heard that prophecy they said my daughter's going to be the one but that prophecy hung for about 200 800 years until an ordained vessel was upon the earth that was connected with that word and it's the same thing with malachi 4 that was been that's been sitting in the scriptures for 2 000 odd years behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful death of the lord he shall turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that part's been sitting there but it had to be an ordained time for an ordained people hallelujah had to have the technology to record his voice upon tape in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all these things had to be there he had to be here but then god when when god thought because who's who's included in that prophecy behold i that's god send you who's to you that's me send you elijah the prophet who's that that's the ministry of brother branham right so just condense in that small phrase as the whole bride and their hearts being turned back to the original faith of the fathers the word living through them amen amen the word becoming material in them it's got you in that verse it's got god in that verse and it's got the prophet in that verse hallelujah before the great and dreadful day of the lord and even the time when that would be fulfilled hallelujah so now the bride experiences the word very differently to i'd say anyone else now you people say well you're trying to be exclusive no but i'm special to god right in my heart i believe just you know i just love it if just everyone just became a believer you know i mean i mean like the entire world everyone believer not just some people everyone wouldn't that be cool wouldn't they just be so amazing you know i i'd love that hallelujah be incredible anyway but whosoever will let them come and so god ordained a word and there's power in that word to change a people that they will actually manifest the promise for their day you take you take their disciples they heard the same preaching everyone else heard but it spoke to them like it didn't speak to them they didn't try and figure you know they had the same kind of ears they they heard the same kind of language but something anchored in their souls hallelujah and that word took them to the upper room where the very god jehovah god came and dwelt in them and lived his life out of them the woman of the well heard the same kind of saw the same kind of discernment that everyone else did but it spoke to her like only god can speak to a predestinated scene and brother brahm said the reason that she came to life is because she had representation in heaven who's heard the future home he uses the woman at the well and the scribes and pharisees he says the scribes and pharisees appeared holy but they had no representation in heaven so when the light came across their path it just blackened them out but the woman at the well her life her natural life was she was an outcast no one wanted her you'd never think she'd be called the bride of jesus christ at all you never think she'd be in the economy of god but in god's mind she had representation in heaven so when the light came along her way it just lit her up says we know when messiah cometh he'll do these things and he just said he that speaks the uh am he and she ran into the yo dropped a water pot ran into the city look i've i met the messiah he's here hallelujah the power of that word came upon her changed your life hallelujah i think that's an incredible thing who's experienced that kind of thing one day you hear it and it's different one day hearing it's living hallelujah it changes you you don't change you it changes you you may have tried to change yourself you just fail but when it changes you when you give your life something in you just says i want to give myself to you lord jesus and he moves on your life and transforms you and sure you have your ups and downs but you weren't the person you were that's the thing i'm not that guy anymore whoever that guy is he's in the past i'm this guy holy and then in a year's time i said i'm not that guy i'm no more more like the lord hallelujah [Music] now i don't want to be too long brother brown makes a statement he says it in the presence of god unrecognized as in i believe it's in 1964. he says this little woman so you speak about the woman with the blood issue um this little woman had an issue of blood and she heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if i can only touch his garment now remember he's still the high priest we touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen that's why brother brown would say when when when the you know the angel lord would be there he'd call people out in the in the congregation not even in the prayer line he says you sir are you ma'am this and this this he asked the question who did they touch and he says he's a high priest you touched by the feeling of your infirmities and the re and what he's trying to get the people to recognize is that high priest the lord jesus is not just up in heaven but he's actually in the building using the prophet to to to speak to people because by faith they're touching jesus right but he's on the platform using human lips telling them you've touched my garment [Music] amen and that same jesus is here hallelujah because brother brown says that pillow fire accompanies the message always that same god not a different one not unless it won the same one hallelujah and when she was come down i mean so and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if i can only touch his garment said and when that genuine faith in god became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it's all about your approach your your attitude towards the word of god brother brahman says will determine your eternal destination your attitude towards it it's not your performance your attitude what you it's not what you think about yourself it's your attitude so if you value it it's just nothing well you'll get that reward if you value this is god in print form amen amen the message reveals christ contained in that message is the revelation of jesus christ amen amen that same jesus so it's your it's your attitude towards it see it released a power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith has saved you what did faith others standing there might have been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence she knowed that that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose do you want to know what the do you believe he's appearing among us right part of the coming is his appearing emerges all together you believe his presence you know as i say camp wasn't enthusiasm it was anointed we weren't excited just because we're at camp no god came and met us right we have meetings in here and god moves it's not our enthusiasm it's god anointing people see people scream and shout and get changed and things happen it's it's god it's coming it's his presence hallelujah you know people say i wish i could go back and live in jesus day you don't have to go back there you don't have to invent a time machine and go back there he's still the same god today he's the same in every detail apart from his physical corporal body which we'll meet in the air but everything he was he still is amen so he says she knowed that was her opportunity so i'm just repeating but if we could only do that people if we could only recognize he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose who wants to know what the purpose is that's to release our desires that we have in him to us that's why he appears among us to release our desires that we have in him to us hallelujah that's why he went to the woman of the well she had a burden or the one with the blood issue she had a sickness or blind bartimaeus his desire was lord i want to see again so he cried out with his faith not not necessarily just his voice but his faith got a hold of jesus jesus was on his way to calvary and his faith made him stand still and meet his knee because he's never walking through jericho that way again you go read it in the gospels and so he had a desire lord i want to i want to see again and he heard of this jesus of nazareth and recognized he was passing his way so it called out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me hallelujah and so he recognized the presence of god was walking past him and it released the desire he had in him lord i want to see lord you're a healer hallelujah amen the centurion recognize the presence of god he had a sick a sick servant who knows a story i trust yeah i trust the gospels are more than stories but you can really literally put yourself there you can be standing in the roman sandals you can be talking to the son of man how you can have a conversation with him and say lord i'm not worthy you come under my roof but you know just as i'm a man under authority i tell this one come here this one do this i know you're under authority as well you know you have power you know you just speak the word only and i know that you are your word this is gentile faith now that jesus is his word so he knew that jesus speaking the word was exactly the same as jesus walking in laying his hands upon his sick servant and pronouncing him him healed exactly the same thing amen hallelujah so we shall recognize now the word of god is upon the earth he is the word he's he's upon the earth he's a real being right and he's present oh that's why we don't need to see now scarred hands we see his spirit moving hallelujah amen so that released to the centurion the desire he had in him his servant got well dries came to the end of himself where his daughter was deathly sick and he had to laugh at his reputation as a leader in the synagogue didn't care what anyone else said about him he put on his little preacher's coat and went found jesus of nazareth and said master come to my house my my daughter's gonna die and they were walking you know jesus consented because he always comes where he's invited and you know on the way a servant comes says don't trouble the master she's dead but he went anyway raised her from the dead so her his desire was that she would be made whole and it's amazing his desire was just she's alive but she'll be made well but the lord took that desire even though she was dead and brought her back to life hallelujah why because jurais recognized the presence of god hallelujah and it released the desire that he had it released his desire that he had for his daughter to be made sick in him to him amen hallelujah and you can go all the way down through the scripture the shunammite woman to elijah i believe it was you go through all of them they had a desire they recognized the presence of god and it released their desire to them had he right had a burden let's just let's just jump right down to 2 000 years down the road she had a burden the salvation of her family and she recognized his brother brown maybe he's still in his his uh hunting outfit i don't know but they're just talking about hunting and then begins to talk about the spoken word the spur you know your squirrels being spoken into existence and something anchors in her heart that's nothing but the truth and then god but remember she's carrying a burden she's not really worried interested in squirrels she wants the salvation of her boys right that's what she wants and so she recognized the prince of god she recognized this is not he's not making this up this is not just a story this is not even some polished up idea this really happened and she just recognized this is the truth and then the lord came down and we know the rest of the story yes sister how do you ask what you will you want a million dollars if it doesn't fall in your lap when you ask for it you call me a false prophet what about your sister here's a wheelchair what about your parents who are old what about this farm you know but her desire wasn't for stuff her sister could get old and die or you know she could heal but die her parents were old already who cares about a farm really you know so heaven with your family or a farm for just a little you know who cares about material things really what's really mattering you know sure we have to do all that kind of stuff but what's the main thing what's the main burden you're carrying the main one and so she had that burden she's i want the salvation of my two boys that's your question were they sitting there all struck we really believe that too you know no they were laughing in the corner snickering just just being kids amen but it released the desire that she had for the lord to do it it wasn't by the ground that it was god that did it amen hallelujah and and he just said well i give you your two boys name of jesus christ you know the rest of the story but that was in the 50s or whenever jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah esther would go to the king one day she had a desire salvation of a family destruction of her enemy she got what she needed she recognized i can get what i need from the king because i'm married to him hallelujah i am mrs a hazaris king of hazaris this is who she recognizes herself to be and she got what she needed now that's just an earthly queen how much more you and i hallelujah we can recognize his presence enough i'll just i'll just read that again he says here if we can only do that tonight people if we can only recognize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest hallelujah not the promised word of moses age or any other ages the promise of the word for this age amen what's the promise of the word for this age god is gathering a people together making them in his image going to take them in the rapture that's the promise you say well i'm just here for a prayer meeting this is what i do on a wednesday if we could only recognize the prince of god that is appearing to us in these meetings that he would release to us our desires that we have in him to us remember those desires aren't for a fancy car for a big job for a big house that's not what those desires are about those desires are lord i need help i need guidance i need deliverance salvation whatever it may be i need my joy back i need my victory back the devil's taking something from me lord i want it back i have a desire i want to worship you like i'm meant to worship you i want to walk with you like you want me to walk with you you know you know brother braham says in one place that that there's a place close to god no i'm not saying it verbatim but there's a place close to god and god ordains who walks there yes sir god ordains it not just anyone and you know that places that's for his bride yes hallelujah it's not where the servants walk it's not where the soldiers walk i'm just using a natural kingdom now it's not where the chefs walk it's where the bride walks hallelujah hallelujah and you know and and and i hope that when i said that you say he's talking about me the lord's brought me real close now i can feel his heartbeat i'm i'm that close against his left rib left hand hallelujah i can feel his heartbeat that's how close i'll walk with him he said well that's just poetic license no do you know his heart do you know what he likes and doesn't like hallelujah that means you know his heart that means you're real close to him hallelujah but he's here tonight i'm just gonna i just want to close with that statement if we can only realize he's here to release to us the desires we
