[29:16] bless you all
[29:17] who's happy to be a Christian hey Lou
[29:20] yeah hey man I'm happy and I saw let's
[29:30] just go from verse 32 say of John 1 and
[29:36] John be record saying I saw the Spirit
[29:38] two sitting from heaven like a dove and
[29:40] abode upon him and then you have naught
[29:43] but he that sent me to baptize with
[29:45] water the same said unto me whom upon
[29:49] whom thou shalt see the spirit
[29:51] descending and remaining on him the same
[29:53] as he which baptizeth with the Holy
[29:55] Ghost and I saw him be record that this
[29:58] is the son of God and again the next day
[30:01] after John stood and and two of his
[30:04] disciples looking upon Jesus as he
[30:07] walked he saith behold the lamb of God I
[30:10] mean may you I made a little bit of good
[30:13] you may be seated tonight now I want to
[30:17] if I could take a bit of a thought
[30:20] tonight I want to preach on I don't I
[30:25] want to preach on Jesus knew who he was
[30:28] you know who you are you got to know who
[30:31] you are brother Brown would say in
[30:33] perfect faith that Jesus knew who he was
[30:36] therefore he could have perfect faith
[30:39] now here it's amazing you see John as we
[30:42] read there as he watched them walk
[30:46] he said behold the lamb of God as he
[30:48] looked upon Jesus he walked he saith
[30:51] behold the lamb of God now Jesus as I
[30:56] said had faith in who he was now he was
[30:58] he was God made flesh when the
[31:01] announcement of his birth came they were
[31:04] instructed you shall call his name Jesus
[31:05] for he shall save his people from their
[31:08] sins and the prophet Isaiah when he saw
[31:11] eight hundred odd years from the time he
[31:13] was standing upon the earth and he saw
[31:15] the Redeemer coming says you shall call
[31:17] his name Emmanuel I meant God with us
[31:21] now if he is he now he was the Lamb of
[31:24] God now a lamb God's lamb has certain
[31:27] you could say characteristics or things
[31:30] that go with it remember Jesus I'm going
[31:32] to it do you know who you are Jesus knew
[31:34] who he was now if he was the Lamb of God
[31:36] therefore he was the perfect sacrifice
[31:38] without sin
[31:40] remember he knew who he was so he knew
[31:42] he was the Lamb of God it is for this
[31:43] course I've come into the world so he
[31:46] knew that he was the Lamb of God he knew
[31:48] he was God's propre Shi ation for sin so
[31:52] therefore if he was he had to be a
[31:53] spotless lamb I mean he had to be
[31:56] without blemish without anything that
[31:58] could be held against him and when
[31:59] Pilate now you know when he went through
[32:02] his great examination in a pilot's
[32:04] judgment Hall you know Pilate came to
[32:06] the conclusion I find no fault in him I
[32:08] mean so he was examined yo false false
[32:11] witnesses came up against him all all
[32:13] manner of things but when the judge gave
[32:15] his verdict he says I find no fault in
[32:17] this man
[32:18] so Jesus now he was he was the Lamb of
[32:23] God's he was a perfect sacrifice without
[32:25] sin and he was examined and found to be
[32:28] that way by man now also he was the
[32:32] second Adam so as the first Adam lost at
[32:34] all the second Adam would redeem it all
[32:36] now the first Adam had Dominion God and
[32:40] in Genesis when when when twin wet when
[32:43] man was created by God God told them now
[32:47] he said he said be fruitful and multiply
[32:50] replenish the earth subdue and have
[32:52] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[32:54] the fowl of the air and over every
[32:55] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[32:58] so they had total dominion
[33:00] over creation now if they had total
[33:03] dominion over creation that anything
[33:06] that came into their realm to try and
[33:08] upset it they had dominion over that
[33:10] thing
[33:10] and so now Jesus now being the second
[33:13] Adam he proved that he had power over
[33:16] nature
[33:16] amen he cursed the fig tree and it
[33:18] didn't bring forth any more figs when
[33:20] when he was asleep in the boat and
[33:22] brother Bram says ten thousand demons
[33:23] swore they drown him that day on the Sea
[33:25] of Galilee and there was now a contest
[33:28] now who really wasn't charge of nature I
[33:30] mean because the devil believed now I'm
[33:32] in control but here was a man who who is
[33:35] maybe he wasn't too tall there's nothing
[33:37] when you when we saw him there's nothing
[33:38] of him that we desire him but he was the
[33:41] crater and flesh a man and and his
[33:44] disciples are welcome don't you know
[33:46] we're going to perish and he stood up
[33:48] and he looked at thee looked at the wind
[33:50] and the waves that he made and he just
[33:52] said peace be still
[33:53] holy he didn't make a big show of it he
[33:55] just said a few words and instantly the
[33:57] storm ceased
[33:58] I mean creation obeyed it's crater
[34:01] hallelujah amen so now he was proving
[34:05] now he was a seeking atom because he was
[34:06] now exhibiting everything that the first
[34:09] Adam did now the first atom when he was
[34:11] standing in his position as a son of God
[34:13] having dominion over the earth there was
[34:15] no death so so Adam could not show that
[34:17] he was ruler over death but now death
[34:19] came into the creation so because the
[34:22] second Adam had dominion over it he
[34:24] could call back the dead back to life
[34:26] again
[34:27] all sickness had to leave amen all
[34:29] manner of diseases had to go every devil
[34:31] had to be cast out nothing could stand
[34:33] before the second Adam hallelujah
[34:36] because in you who he was Amen so now he
[34:39] so he now had power and he demonstrated
[34:42] that power yes hallelujah but also
[34:45] because he was he was the son of God not
[34:49] only did he show that he had dominion
[34:50] over the devil in this realm but when he
[34:53] when he died on the cross and they put
[34:54] his body in the tomb Amen he showed I
[34:57] have power all power in heaven and earth
[34:59] and he went down into hell and privily
[35:01] had dominion over hell and and the death
[35:03] that you know the grave couldn't hold
[35:05] him I mean hell couldn't hold him
[35:07] hallelujah he just went down there to
[35:09] prove to Satan this is me
[35:10] Amen you've you've been waiting for me
[35:13] to come
[35:13] being trying to stop me to come you
[35:15] couldn't stop me coming here I am and
[35:16] now I'm in control a means that he
[35:19] proved now that he had dominion glory to
[35:22] God I meant because he is the second
[35:24] Adam
[35:25] I meant so Jesus knew who he was Jesus
[35:29] believed me but he was a man me but
[35:31] Jesus was he was totally God but it was
[35:34] totally man he had to be totally God
[35:36] because no man could who could redeem
[35:38] the earth because we're all born in a
[35:39] fallen state not one of us could save
[35:42] another amen doesn't matter how holy we
[35:45] think we are all it doesn't matter any
[35:47] prophet amen because when John was there
[35:50] up in heaven waiting and he saw the book
[35:52] seal and he wept because he couldn't see
[35:55] anyone no man was found worthy Moses was
[35:58] there Elijah was there
[36:00] Joseph was there I mean all the prophets
[36:03] down through the ages were there but he
[36:05] couldn't he wept because in you if
[36:06] someone wasn't found worthy a man to be
[36:09] worthy to take that book
[36:10] amen to to to redeem back everything
[36:13] that had been lost everything was in
[36:16] jeopardy but in John was told weep not
[36:19] John he comes the lamb hallelujah and he
[36:22] stepped forth Amen to prove to prove
[36:25] that what he purchased on Calvary Amen
[36:27] that purchase was good enough he paid it
[36:30] in full then he steps forth
[36:32] hallelujah to lay claims on what belongs
[36:34] to him glory to God now if this is the
[36:38] case which it is then there has to be a
[36:42] people now because if here's the second
[36:44] Adam there has to be a second Eve I'm
[36:46] sure you've heard the message the
[36:48] masterpiece brother Bram speaks about
[36:50] your there was the perfect family in
[36:51] Eden there was the husband and the wife
[36:53] Adam and Eve they were God's masterpiece
[36:55] but then send kripp then and and broke
[36:58] the masterpiece down but then God he
[37:00] wouldn't be defeated how God won't be
[37:03] defeated
[37:03] holy you gotta have that it always in
[37:05] the back of your mind my God will not be
[37:07] defeated Amen he won't allow me to be
[37:09] beaten down and trodden and and and you
[37:12] know lost and undone he won't be
[37:14] defeated hallelujah if God has called
[37:16] you friends I mean if God has called me
[37:18] if God has spoken to me hallelujah
[37:21] there's a purpose of them speaking to me
[37:23] there's a purpose of him dying for me is
[37:25] a
[37:26] stealing me with His Holy Spirit I mean
[37:28] he's not gonna leave you in the hands of
[37:30] the devil or in just some battles some
[37:32] trent someplace he's gonna see you
[37:33] overcome hallelujah
[37:35] he will not be defeated I mean we will
[37:38] walk victoriously of this earth amen it
[37:41] has to happen Alleluia Jesus fulfilled
[37:45] all the prophecies concerning his first
[37:48] coming when he's here in the days of his
[37:50] flesh he knew the grade couldn't hold
[37:53] him as I said he was a man so that means
[37:55] he had their faith revealed faith he he
[37:58] knew who he was you know he wasn't
[38:00] trying to just hold on to a nice
[38:02] scripture when he went to Calvary he he
[38:05] was living out he was a prisoner to the
[38:07] word that was promised him he couldn't
[38:10] live any other kind of life I mean he
[38:12] knew he was the Lamb of God he knew he
[38:14] was the one
[38:15] I mean to redeem the earth and he knew
[38:18] his soul could not stay in hell because
[38:20] his body could not see corruption
[38:22] he knew it amen any went to Calvary with
[38:25] that one scripture with the sin of the
[38:27] world upon him as a sinner but in you
[38:30] I'm not going to stay there
[38:31] Allu yeah my body will not decay a lujah
[38:35] and that faith he says I have power to
[38:37] lay my life down of my power to raise it
[38:40] back up again no man takes my life but I
[38:43] give it freely hallelujah and he did
[38:46] exactly that now as I said God's
[38:49] masterpiece
[38:50] he was the masterpiece of the Old
[38:51] Testament brother bran would say that
[38:54] Jesus in the days of his flesh fulfilled
[38:58] the Old Testament and he says as as
[39:01] Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament the
[39:03] bride will fulfill the New Testament
[39:06] Alleluia oh I'll find the court later
[39:11] for you brother BAM speaks about it so
[39:13] he knew all the prophecies that he would
[39:16] fulfill and when he was walking with the
[39:19] two on the way to Emmaus and Luke
[39:21] chapter 24 he began to speak to them
[39:24] I'll fulfill prophecy in their day and
[39:27] they did not understand who he was but
[39:31] he it says he started at Moses and went
[39:34] from Moses and went all the way down
[39:36] through the scripture and meant to see
[39:38] if the people would
[39:40] understand if they would catch what is
[39:43] going on in their day an hour they had
[39:46] seen God do something they knew he is a
[39:48] prophet know many of us bake like this
[39:50] man they've seen him do incredible
[39:52] things but now it had to come a time
[39:54] where they just didn't look upon God
[39:56] doing things they had to become they're
[39:58] part of the vision a man where because
[40:01] the mystery the mystery of Jesus coming
[40:03] wasn't wasn't him coming in the flesh
[40:06] that was prophesied they will come but
[40:08] the mystery is Peter James and John I
[40:10] mean it two ways the woman that's
[40:12] actually you know the bride 120 in the
[40:14] upper room there was a prophecy I'll
[40:16] pour my spirit out upon all flesh but
[40:19] who would fulfill that prophecy was the
[40:22] mystery so here was Peter James and John
[40:24] they were part of the first coming a
[40:26] minute on the way to Emmaus they were
[40:28] part of that resurrection hour but they
[40:31] had to go from seeing God fulfill it as
[40:34] a man to understand that now they become
[40:37] the fulfillment of the rest of them of
[40:39] the coming hallelujah that's why he
[40:43] walked with them and he began to open
[40:44] the scriptures to them because they had
[40:46] to understand you're part of this you're
[40:50] part of the resurrection you're in the
[40:52] resurrection I'm walking with you that
[40:54] you would understand you're part of this
[40:56] resurrection I mean because it wasn't
[40:58] just Jesus that had to be resurrected
[40:59] there's the people that had to be
[41:01] resurrected hallelujah and it's the same
[41:04] thing with you friend you got to
[41:06] understand why is this message become
[41:07] alive why is it precious to you why is
[41:10] it more than your next breath I mean why
[41:13] is it so important why is this this
[41:14] Bible so precious to you hallelujah
[41:17] because God is wanting you to see your
[41:19] part of the fulfillment of the word
[41:21] I mean God has to put on flesh to
[41:23] fulfill his work and he's gonna fulfill
[41:25] it through his bride Alleluia now he
[41:33] says here if I can find it
[41:39] now
[41:44] now let's just go the others a Vincent
[41:47] made clear by prophecy let's just go
[41:49] back a few minutes and now let's listen
[41:50] to the words quoted from himself
[41:53] watch the word quoted from himself watch
[41:55] here the word itself quoting the word of
[41:58] himself the word itself quoting the word
[42:01] of himself not tell them that he was
[42:03] that by just let the word speak for
[42:05] itself then they know who he was the
[42:08] letter of the word quoting the word the
[42:10] word and flesh quoting the word of the
[42:13] letter being fully identified with
[42:15] himself
[42:16] look here now let's listen to him quote
[42:18] now we know that they were all briefed
[42:21] on the late happenings that is of the
[42:23] crucifixion and of the story of the
[42:25] resurrection the tomb as we just read
[42:27] now you go Rick Lou your read Luke 24
[42:30] they tell Jesus are you a stranger here
[42:33] you don't know what's been going on they
[42:35] said we believe you as a prophet he is
[42:37] crucified and and they say he's yo they
[42:40] they say he's risen from the dead again
[42:41] he they tell him men they don't fully
[42:44] grasp what's going on and then he begins
[42:47] to speak to them
[42:48] Oh falls and slow of heart and he begins
[42:52] to heat you know in these starts at
[42:54] Moses and now he goes straight to the
[42:56] word of prophecy about himself now let's
[42:59] just think what he said he said a lot
[43:00] more than this but watch remember he's
[43:02] got six hours he's going to give them a
[43:04] six hour sermon offer filled scripture
[43:06] there's a reason he's doing it he's not
[43:08] just he's not just wine to excite their
[43:11] minds but he's warning them as I said
[43:13] before to understand the reason that
[43:16] they have been their eyes have open to
[43:18] what's going on they weren't like the
[43:19] scribes and Pharisees they believe this
[43:22] is him right they believed there was him
[43:24] and they had to but Jesus himself had to
[43:28] come and take them the rest of the way
[43:30] to show they are in the resurrection and
[43:33] he has come as I see why is this so
[43:36] incredible why is this message so alive
[43:38] as God is just holding us down more and
[43:41] more to be more like him amen and we
[43:44] begin to see that we are part of the
[43:46] word amen that we are the Word made
[43:48] flesh today that God is fulfilling his
[43:51] New Testament through you through your
[43:54] life it's a now turn over to Zechariah
[43:56] 11 and 12
[43:58] and wasn't the Messiah to be sold
[43:59] according to the Prophet for thirty
[44:01] pieces of silver you just said this man
[44:04] was sold for thirty pieces of silver
[44:05] turn over you're getting them scripture
[44:07] Zechariah living in 12 then he said did
[44:09] you notice that David said in the psalm
[44:11] Psalms 41 and 9 that he was to be
[44:13] betrayed by his friends than again in
[44:15] Zechariah 13 and 7 he was forsaken by
[44:17] his disciples and in Psalms 30:5 xi
[44:20] accused by false witnesses you said you
[44:24] just said he was isaiah 53:7 he was done
[44:26] before his accusers Isaiah 50 and 6 they
[44:29] scourged him the prophecy it sounds 22
[44:31] he was to cry on the cross my God my God
[44:34] why cell for sake of me did he do that
[44:36] day before yesterday afternoon Psalms 22
[44:39] a again 18 his garments were to be
[44:41] parted among them did they do that and
[44:43] Psalms 22 7 to 8 them mocked by his
[44:46] enemies the church Psalms 22 again there
[44:50] was not a bone in his body to be broke
[44:52] but they pierced my hands and my feet he
[44:54] said holding his hands behind him no
[44:56] doubt at a time isaiah 53:12 said he
[44:58] would die between malefactors isaiah
[45:01] 53:9 said he'd be buried with the rich
[45:03] Psalm 16:10 said I will not leave a soul
[45:06] in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy
[45:08] One to see corruption and was not
[45:10] Malachi 3 the forerunner of this man I'd
[45:13] like to I've heard him quote look at all
[45:15] the prophecies notice in all the types
[45:18] he might have went through about Isaac
[45:20] in Genesis how God overshadowed I am
[45:22] Isaac how father Abraham took him took
[45:25] his own son packing the wood up the hill
[45:26] and offered up his own son
[45:29] any-any and he just continues on you
[45:31] know six hours this day the Scriptures
[45:33] fulfilled amen and and the questions you
[45:37] know did he do that and they would have
[45:38] actually said yeah he did do that and
[45:40] then he cry my god my god was there for
[45:43] sake of me they would have said yeah he
[45:44] he I heard him I heard him say all those
[45:47] things and then now we've come down to
[45:50] this hour you say well why are you
[45:51] talking about these things because
[45:53] history has repeated itself I merely see
[45:56] was it that was in the days of Sodom as
[45:58] was the days of lot you know of Noah so
[46:01] shall it be when the Son of Man is
[46:02] revealed
[46:03] now that's Jesus being revealed again
[46:05] and you could ask the question you know
[46:07] did he send her did he send a prophet
[46:10] with the spirit of Elijah did he
[46:12] do that amen did he turn the hearts of
[46:15] the children back to the faith of the
[46:16] fathers did he do that
[46:18] amen did he reveal the truth of the word
[46:20] has he done that as all seven seals open
[46:23] has he done that Amen has he restored us
[46:25] back to the faith of the fathers has he
[46:27] done that has he become a living reality
[46:29] has he stepped out of history has he
[46:31] done that when he promises on the ever
[46:33] leave thee nor forsake thee has he done
[46:35] that I mean when Paul would speak about
[46:37] thee y-you know about the cycle of the
[46:40] rapture and about how the Lord Himself
[46:42] well this yo will descend with a shout
[46:44] has he done that I mean he says you're
[46:46] not children of darkness that they
[46:48] should overcome you but your children of
[46:49] the light
[46:50] 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 has he done
[46:52] that has you opened up your eyes of
[46:54] understanding holy has become a God of
[46:57] reality to you I mean it has he done
[46:59] that has he made this Bible live has he
[47:01] done that hallelujah why is he done
[47:03] those things you must understand you are
[47:05] part of the word I mean you are
[47:07] fulfilling the scripture I meant to be a
[47:10] to be a written epistle read known of
[47:12] all men there's more than just doctrine
[47:14] I mean but it's a life being expressed
[47:17] hallelujah Amen has he opened his word
[47:21] hallelujah is this row back in its
[47:23] homeland has he done that hallelujah yes
[47:26] he has
[47:27] Amen we live an incredible time now has
[47:34] he called the people out of every
[47:35] kindred nation and tongue has he done
[47:37] that there are people almost everywhere
[47:39] whose hearts are all aflame virtually
[47:41] every language under heaven there's a
[47:44] believer that can say Amen when you say
[47:46] Amen and they know the same God you know
[47:49] hallelujah has he done that a man is he
[47:52] has he has he opened up his plan of
[47:54] redemption to us Amen that this is a new
[47:57] book personally to you has he done that
[48:00] Alleluia
[48:01] has he taken a bride for himself as he
[48:05] said he would
[48:05] I'll take her people for my namesake has
[48:08] he done it a man has he you know has he
[48:12] what the enemy is doing has he done that
[48:15] has he has he totally taken the cover
[48:17] off of Satan and his workings has he
[48:19] done that hallelujah has he declared his
[48:22] bride sinless a man has
[48:25] mr. fighter has he glorified or as he
[48:27] called her yes he's done that now when I
[48:30] say these things you'd say Lord you've
[48:32] done that for me
[48:33] amen that man's talking about me holy
[48:36] when you hear about the message you hear
[48:38] invisible union of the Bride of Christ
[48:39] and he talks about a sinless virtuous
[48:42] woman Alleluia
[48:44] I mean that she was trapped into it the
[48:46] other reason why we so we think of our
[48:48] pastor we get so shocked by it's because
[48:51] once upon time we weren't all that
[48:52] shocked by it but God gave us a new
[48:55] nature hallelujah I mean that's why
[48:57] sometimes it's not guilt it's just shock
[48:59] oh I can't believe I did that
[49:01] well the old you didn't do that any but
[49:03] the new you would never go near those
[49:05] things
[49:06] hallelujah amen has he given us a heart
[49:09] of taking out our heart of stone giving
[49:11] us a heart of flesh and a new spirit and
[49:13] then his spirit in the middle has he
[49:15] done those things hallelujah yes he's
[49:19] done those things uh is there a woman in
[49:21] the land that is made by his word has he
[49:26] done that well Alou you wear the most
[49:28] Bible believing people in the earth Amen
[49:31] he restored us back to the truth
[49:33] Alleluia you know this there's a person
[49:37] at work I work with and uh we might have
[49:40] there we need to look at the Hall but
[49:42] we're gonna maybe use the hall at the
[49:45] end of November gospel hall they see if
[49:47] we don't use this we don't allow funny
[49:49] people here like you know Mormons and
[49:52] Jehovah's Witnesses your people that are
[49:53] on the Bible I thought my heart well
[49:55] you'll probably put us in that box
[49:58] because you got to put us in some box
[49:59] but we're the most Bible believing
[50:01] people there are Alleluia cuz he's
[50:03] turned us back to the truth the message
[50:05] reveals Christ in here Alleluia now the
[50:09] Bride of Christ
[50:10] they got okay so as I said Jesus had
[50:13] faith and who he was he knew who he was
[50:16] he wasn't you know he wasn't guessing
[50:19] maybe this is me or maybe this is what I
[50:21] got to fulfill he knew the word that he
[50:23] had to fulfill now if that's the case
[50:26] another I said he was the Lamb of God he
[50:28] was a sick in Adam and he was more than
[50:29] that right I just took two examples but
[50:33] he knew I have come to take dominion
[50:35] Amen I've come to take over I've come to
[50:39] Oh Satan what a man really can do in the
[50:41] hands of God because he's our example
[50:43] now if that's and then he was the lamb
[50:46] she was sinless
[50:47] he says I have no part in the devil he
[50:49] has no part in me a mint now if that's
[50:52] the case in the Bride of Christ has
[50:55] certain things as well but they're not
[50:58] of her own not of herself but the bride
[51:01] as I've said and we can read in here you
[51:02] go read Romans chapter 8 that whom he is
[51:05] called he's also justified whom is
[51:07] justified is also glorified who can late
[51:09] charge to God's elect it's God that
[51:11] justify you know so Paul begins to lay
[51:14] out some things there and the reason
[51:16] that you know Paul would be inspired to
[51:19] write those things as God is wanting to
[51:21] tell you this is what I think of you as
[51:23] the Bride of Christ you are a very
[51:26] special woman right and so now the bride
[51:30] is perfect the bride has a perfect
[51:34] sacrifice may I see it her everything
[51:38] she has is not of herself it's of him
[51:40] right but now because now this is where
[51:43] I came with this thought sometimes you
[51:45] know such a big challenge can be later I
[51:47] let well he believed who he was
[51:48] therefore he had perfect faith even know
[51:51] what about us and we begin to look at
[51:53] they say now how can I kind of climb
[51:55] this mountain this seems too big to kind
[51:57] of you know grasp or you know walk walk
[52:00] with if I can put it that way but then
[52:03] you've got to understand now if he has
[52:06] made you thus and he's given you things
[52:08] that you can do it all right is that
[52:11] right
[52:11] so now if the bride the bride has a
[52:15] perfect sacrifice now now did that go
[52:17] over why you got to understand so he has
[52:19] made as his mate as bride perfect she is
[52:23] sinless
[52:23] she has robed in his righteousness right
[52:26] she amen
[52:28] she is as righteous as God is righteous
[52:31] okay
[52:32] she has been fully justified as if
[52:35] you've never did it in the first place
[52:36] the first place was the mind of God
[52:38] right let's just read some scriptures
[52:40] revelations 19 revelations 19 will read
[52:47] verses 7 to 9 I know this is familiar to
[52:50] everyone but
[52:52] you got to see what you know you say I
[52:56] don't know if I can be the Bride of
[52:57] Christ has he given you the invitation
[52:59] and the reason I laboured so much in the
[53:03] star the service was he's walked with
[53:05] you modernly means to make clear by
[53:07] prophesy he walked with it - on the way
[53:09] to Emmaus - tell them they are in the
[53:11] resurrection and they begin to realize
[53:12] we are part of this resurrection because
[53:15] now we find ourselves going up into the
[53:17] upper room and now we find the
[53:19] resurrected one coming dwelling in us
[53:21] hallelujah
[53:22] so he walked with them that they would
[53:25] understand and know they are part of the
[53:27] fulfillment of the word for their day
[53:29] and the reason that this message has
[53:31] become so incredibly wonderful to you
[53:33] and it's more than life and it's become
[53:36] a reality is because he wants you to
[53:38] know it is because you're part of the
[53:40] word for this day yes okay and if you're
[53:43] part of the word for this day you are
[53:44] the Bride of Christ okay and he has made
[53:47] you thus you say well I don't have a big
[53:50] understanding if there's a little twinge

[1:01:10] hallelujah as the same thing with us yes
[1:01:14] I've never seen a book physically open
[1:01:15] in that manner but something in his word
[1:01:17] that's why it goes beyond this I mean it
[1:01:21] may be your culture or ever you're from
[1:01:23] but it gives a hold of your soul I mean
[1:01:26] even if you wrestle with and I don't
[1:01:27] understand I don't know I mean just give
[1:01:30] yourself to him
[1:01:31] don't worry about don't worry about that
[1:01:33] I have to do this I've to do that it's
[1:01:35] not about that
[1:01:35] it's I come even so Lord Jesus I come
[1:01:40] hallelujah second Corinthians five and
[1:01:44] 21 for he hath made him remember the
[1:01:50] brightest perfect you look at yourself
[1:01:54] forget what you think of yourself just
[1:01:56] forget about it I mean take what God
[1:01:59] says about you for he had made him to be
[1:02:02] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[1:02:07] be made the righteousness of God in him
[1:02:10] hallelujah he was made sin what a
[1:02:14] credible transaction I'll take your
[1:02:16] place children I'll redeem you back to
[1:02:19] myself
[1:02:20] Alleluia that you would be made the
[1:02:22] righteousness of God in him
[1:02:24] therefore we can say by according member
[1:02:27] al this our walk with God is based on
[1:02:30] faith in his word above all things your
[1:02:34] emotion comes with it sure rejoicing
[1:02:37] comes with it or you know his anointing
[1:02:39] comes with a bow first and foremost it's
[1:02:40] faith in his word that's we're saved
[1:02:43] through faith amen so now I believe that
[1:02:47] Scripture I believe it that he became
[1:02:51] sin that I would become as righteousness
[1:02:53] hallelujah
[1:02:54] so therefore based on that Scripture I
[1:02:56] the brightest is righteous as he is
[1:02:59] righteous she is sinless as he is
[1:03:02] sinless amen she is perfect as he is
[1:03:06] perfect hallelujah amen by one offering
[1:03:10] he has done this I mean it would it says
[1:03:13] in Hebrews I love it this word is more I
[1:03:17] think it has more potency I mean this
[1:03:20] the epistles have more power I mean this
[1:03:23] word has more power today to me does
[1:03:26] just me they did when it was written
[1:03:27] they hadn't fully even the Apostle Paul
[1:03:30] didn't fully grasp I don't think I mean
[1:03:33] when he would say who can lay charge the
[1:03:35] gods he left immense God that justify
[1:03:37] earth hallelujah all guilt is gone amen
[1:03:43] all guilt is gone by the blood of Jesus
[1:03:45] Christ don't let your past hold you back
[1:03:48] if anything you should rejoice I was
[1:03:51] once that I'm not that
[1:03:53] that person died I don't know where he's
[1:03:55] gone hallelujah I'm a new creature I
[1:03:58] mean we are not remember we are not a
[1:04:00] patched up job we're a new creation I
[1:04:03] mean when it would say in in revelations
[1:04:06] chapter 3 that he is the beginning of
[1:04:08] the creation of God the Prophet would
[1:04:11] tell us that this word beginning is
[1:04:14] actually author revelations 3 and 14 and
[1:04:19] I see it unto the angel of the church of
[1:04:20] the lady of seon's
[1:04:22] write these things saith the Amen the
[1:04:24] faithful and true witness and the
[1:04:27] beginning of the creation of God now
[1:04:29] this word beginning actually means
[1:04:30] author so he's going to and it's
[1:04:33] actually speaking of an author of a new
[1:04:35] creation
[1:04:36] I meant member when Paul said that
[1:04:39] you're if you're in Christ you're a new
[1:04:41] creature you're a new creation so we're
[1:04:43] not just a patched up job but we've been
[1:04:45] created over again
[1:04:46] this body is still falling body but our
[1:04:49] spirit our soul have been converted to
[1:04:52] faith right and he's made us over new
[1:04:55] again we still the same old soul I hope
[1:04:57] I get the terminology right we can
[1:04:58] understand we're not just patched up
[1:05:00] we're a new we are a new creation we're
[1:05:03] a brand-new man so here he comes just
[1:05:05] like in Genesis chapter 1 broods over
[1:05:08] the earth hallelujah I love Genesis 1
[1:05:11] and 2 well heard of God amen
[1:05:14] chapter 3 as well because there's a
[1:05:17] promise on three I'm going to undo this
[1:05:19] and now we're living at the end of that
[1:05:21] promise I mean where he came and he died
[1:05:24] amen that the head of the serpent was
[1:05:26] bruised I mean by his faintness he'll
[1:05:29] was you know the seat of the woman's
[1:05:31] heel was was bruised because that's
[1:05:32] where he his feet you stand upon there
[1:05:34] he stood upon the head of the serpent
[1:05:36] there at Calvary
[1:05:37] Amen brother Brahim said on that day of
[1:05:39] Calvary he says brother it's like the
[1:05:41] devil has gone oh he's like an animal
[1:05:42] with a broken back hallelujah and hasn't
[1:05:46] been healed it hasn't even as even
[1:05:48] scabbed over a man you could like try
[1:05:51] and operate with a broken back that's
[1:05:52] how the devil is God has totally our
[1:05:57] enemy is defeated but he's a liar and
[1:06:00] you got to expose us lie
[1:06:02] I remember Genesis 1 it says the earth
[1:06:05] was without form and void
[1:06:07] discover the face of the deep that was
[1:06:08] you that was you but then the Spirit of
[1:06:11] God began to brood over the face of the
[1:06:13] waters
[1:06:14] why is that he's got a creation it's got
[1:06:17] a creation that's got to come you know
[1:06:19] this earth isn't the biggest planet you
[1:06:24] know in the universe that they say that
[1:06:28] there's other planets that are in a
[1:06:29] habitable zone where life can come and
[1:06:33] that means a zone where it's certain
[1:06:35] amount of distance from the Sun that it
[1:06:37] orbits that it's not too hot not too
[1:06:38] cold life couldn't be there now to me
[1:06:41] I'm not worried about that
[1:06:43] it's like many people it's 7 7 billion
[1:06:46] people on the earth but there's only a
[1:06:48] few that have real life that can come
[1:06:50] forth it's like this earth it may not be
[1:06:53] the biggest planet where life could be
[1:06:56] it may not be the smallest or the most
[1:06:57] fancy but it's there and it's got life
[1:06:59] and it's the same thing with you is it
[1:07:02] you understand what I'm saying Alleluia
[1:07:04] here you are
[1:07:05] and God broods over you because he's a
[1:07:07] life that must come forth and the
[1:07:12] creation comes forth and here you are
[1:07:16] where are new creations glory to God
[1:07:21] now I'll read something then we'll maybe
[1:07:24] close I know Jesus said and I said
[1:07:30] before you'll find the scripture he says
[1:07:32] I have no part in him the devil and he
[1:07:34] is no part of me and the bride because
[1:07:37] we are part of him we had that same
[1:07:40] testimony we never belonged to the devil
[1:07:42] I mean we're never meant to be under his
[1:07:45] Dominion Amen we have no part in him he
[1:07:48] is no part of us hallelujah
[1:07:51] now we are joint heirs with Christ the
[1:07:56] scripture tells us amen we had joint
[1:07:58] heirs with Christ so as he had Dominion
[1:08:01] we have dominion through him as Jesus is
[1:08:06] the word and manifested the promised
[1:08:08] word for his day so she'll is bride
[1:08:11] fulfill every prophecy that speaks of
[1:08:13] her that's why as I said I think on
[1:08:15] Sunday look at all the promises that
[1:08:16] relate to you get those exceeding
[1:08:19] precious promises
[1:08:20] and look at them look at them spend time
[1:08:23] read through read through what brother
[1:08:27] Brown would sound the message he say
[1:08:29] Lord by your grace I'm one of them
[1:08:33] amen I want to see this live amen say
[1:08:40] that's pretty bold to say Lord you want
[1:08:42] to see the scripture love Father Brown
[1:08:43] was out hunting and for many years he
[1:08:46] would think about Matthew I think mark
[1:08:48] where it says if you say to this
[1:08:49] mountain be thou removed and cast into
[1:08:51] the sea he was thinking about that
[1:08:53] scripture how does that work how does
[1:08:54] this happen he's out hunting and then
[1:08:57] the Lord comes
[1:08:59] he says how many screws do you need they
[1:09:02] say I'm gonna show you what that
[1:09:03] scripture means I'm gonna show you what
[1:09:05] it mean I'm going to interpret that
[1:09:06] scripture to you you're gonna experience
[1:09:07] a member to be a disciple is not just a
[1:09:10] disciple is not made by teaching only a
[1:09:14] disciple is made by practical experience
[1:09:17] all right that's why that's why as we
[1:09:20] walk with Him the Lord teaches us
[1:09:22] different things because he's making us
[1:09:25] his disciple by practical thing sure we
[1:09:28] listen and we and we you know and we
[1:09:31] read and all those things and we pray
[1:09:33] but it's through practical things he
[1:09:34] shows us that's like I am the love of
[1:09:37] Hills all thy diseases they can just be
[1:09:39] up here but then you get sick and you
[1:09:41] say oh God heal me and he shows you this
[1:09:44] is the interpretation of the scripture
[1:09:46] amen I am your you know I'm your
[1:09:49] Shepherd and he allows you maybe to go
[1:09:53] off some path someplace and he's seen
[1:09:55] sheep man I just when I Drive over hay
[1:09:57] woods you see sheep they on the side of
[1:09:58] the road I think man those things would
[1:10:00] be chomped up a visit any wolves around
[1:10:02] there's such a helpless animal but think
[1:10:06] about our Shepherd he knows before you
[1:10:09] need a when you call he'll answer you
[1:10:13] say Lord I've got off I don't know where
[1:10:15] I don't know how to get out of this and
[1:10:17] you call upon him he reaches down as
[1:10:19] great hands maybe just twist your view
[1:10:22] look there oh I go this way hallelujah
[1:10:25] that's a practical thing isn't it

[1:11:09] isn't the masterpiece he says now for
[1:11:15] nearly two thousand years God has been
[1:11:17] making him a masterpiece because he
[1:11:19] struck Adam to get a masterpiece off of
[1:11:23] him part of him a rib to make a wife for
[1:11:25] him and now that the perfect masterpiece
[1:11:28] that he struck at Calvary he'd got a
[1:11:31] piece off of him that's just the New
[1:11:33] Testament that's all he fulfilled the
[1:11:36] Old Testament now it's the New Testament
[1:11:38] another piece to be fulfilled see the
[1:11:41] new and oldest husband and wife see and
[1:11:43] it's taken the new I mean the old to
[1:11:46] foreshadow than you Christ came the
[1:11:48] masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[1:11:50] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:11:52] the New Testament another masterpiece in
[1:11:55] is in making as it was taken him 4,000
[1:12:00] years to make his masterpiece now he's
[1:12:02] been for nearly 2,000 years making
[1:12:04] another masterpiece of bride for Christ
[1:12:06] another masterpiece and so doing it he
[1:12:08] does it by his never-changing method the
[1:12:12] same way he made the masterpieces word
[1:12:14] that's the way he makes his masterpieces
[1:12:16] because he can only be a perfect
[1:12:18] masterpiece when it's the perfect word
[1:12:23] Alleluia this is the bride wolf of will
[1:12:26] fulfill all the New Testament amen so
[1:12:33] now as I said he believed who he was and
[1:12:38] that's how he had perfect faith brother
[1:12:40] I'm sitting the perfect face message he
[1:12:42] says you just think about Calvary and
[1:12:44] what he's done to you he said that ought
[1:12:47] to give
[1:12:47] perfect faith I mean does it not when
[1:12:52] you think about it we have such
[1:12:53] assurance blessed assurance Jesus is
[1:12:55] mine I mean that he dead he died in our
[1:12:58] place he took all of our sin remember we
[1:13:02] were trapped into it we were the first
[1:13:05] nature that we were born with we were
[1:13:07] trapped into it by Adam aney to be born
[1:13:10] the way we were we were trapped into it
[1:13:13] and that's why we can be so sometimes
[1:13:16] even disgusted by the things he once did
[1:13:19] but it was because it was that old
[1:13:21] nature in our life but he made us new
[1:13:24] creations and that's why we can look
[1:13:27] back at those things and say I can't
[1:13:28] believe over did them because we're
[1:13:31] being made new again but so that
[1:13:32] shouldn't give you guilt to think about
[1:13:35] the things you used to do it should just
[1:13:37] give you Thanksgiving saying thank you
[1:13:38] Lord I don't have that nature anymore
[1:13:40] it's been killed out of me I mean I'm a
[1:13:43] new creature in you hallelujah amen no I
[1:13:51] want to read this now this is in the
[1:13:56] spoken word original seat this is the
[1:13:57] words of the church a part of it now the
[1:14:00] second the second son has spoken seed
[1:14:02] word of God was given a bride like Adam
[1:14:04] but before he could marry her she had
[1:14:07] fallen also for she was to be put on
[1:14:10] free moral agency like Adams wife was to
[1:14:12] believe God's Word and live or doubted
[1:14:14] and died and she did then from a little
[1:14:16] group of the true seed of the word God
[1:14:19] will present Christ a beloved bride a
[1:14:21] virgin a virgin of his word and through
[1:14:23] them and by them will be fulfilled all
[1:14:25] that's been promised for his hour and
[1:14:28] the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed's
[1:14:31] or dogmas I'm reading about you okay I'm
[1:14:36] this is you should say how does he know
[1:14:38] about me the word of promise in himself
[1:14:44] like it wasn't Mary God himself made
[1:14:47] manifest he will act himself by his own
[1:14:49] word of promise so to fulfill all that
[1:14:53] has been written of him as he did when
[1:14:55] he came from the Virgin womb type of the
[1:14:58] spirit room now so will the Virgin now
[1:15:00] accepting a
[1:15:01] would be done to me as thou has said who
[1:15:04] said that who said that to God he said
[1:15:07] that be done to me according to thy word
[1:15:10] hallelujah though it was said by an
[1:15:14] angel while it was yet the written word
[1:15:16] Isaiah 9:6 they will love him who loves
[1:15:20] them love his and and will have his
[1:15:25] potentials for his their head and they
[1:15:28] are his subjects subjects to us head
[1:15:31] headship of Christ was was his notice
[1:15:34] what harmony Jesus never did anything
[1:15:37] until seen it of the father or the
[1:15:39] father showed him first
[1:15:40] how many between God and Christ see John
[1:15:42] 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her
[1:15:46] his word of life hello you should just
[1:15:51] be saying yes yes yep glory because this
[1:15:54] is just basically my my walk with him
[1:15:59] amen and he shows her his word of life
[1:16:02] he shows her and she receives it she
[1:16:05] never doubts that nothing can harm not
[1:16:08] even death Florida God for if the seed
[1:16:11] be planted the water will rise it up
[1:16:13] again I mean then I got a great big
[1:16:15] hallelujah here is the secret this is
[1:16:18] brother man here's the secret the word
[1:16:20] is in the bright and the mind of Christ
[1:16:22] to know what he wants done with the work
[1:16:24] and she does it in his name
[1:16:27] she has thus saith the Lord then it is
[1:16:30] Germanized
[1:16:31] so the Holy Spirit waters it until it
[1:16:33] growin and serves its purpose
[1:16:36] amen what do you think the Lord just
[1:16:38] come you know it quickens his word to
[1:16:40] you
[1:16:40] MS Dermot eyes comes alive hallelujah
[1:16:44] and it's growing and serves its purpose
[1:16:48] Alleluia they will only do his will
[1:16:51] Amen I believe that no one can persuade
[1:16:55] them different they have that said that
[1:16:58] Lauder they keep still then they will do
[1:17:00] the works of God for it is himself and
[1:17:03] them continuing his word to fulfill as
[1:17:06] he did complete in his days all things
[1:17:10] when he was here he did not complete all
[1:17:12] when he is here for it was no
[1:17:15] time yet he didn't go into all the world
[1:17:18] and preach the gospel they meant there
[1:17:21] are things that he had not the things
[1:17:23] that he did not fulfill in his body of
[1:17:24] flesh he came to purchase our Redemption
[1:17:26] and the user's man to find all the lost
[1:17:30] ones I mean and to complete his work now
[1:17:35] he says now let us stand like Joshua and
[1:17:36] Caleb
[1:17:37] now what's closed this is going to have
[1:17:40] a spiritual background now let us stand
[1:17:42] like Joshua and Caleb as we see the
[1:17:44] promised land coming in sight as nearing
[1:17:46] the time to be given Joshua and Hebrew
[1:17:48] means Savior and represents the promise
[1:17:50] in time leader to take the church over
[1:17:53] caleb represents the true believer who
[1:17:55] stayed with Joshua God started as rails
[1:17:58] a virgin with his word but they wanted
[1:18:00] something different so did the last day
[1:18:02] church notice how God did not move as
[1:18:04] role till his own appointed time now
[1:18:06] listen this is going to mean something
[1:18:08] Joshua waited for that time no matter
[1:18:11] how much people might have said God give
[1:18:13] us the land the promise let us go now
[1:18:16] and take it they might have said Joshua
[1:18:18] you lost your commission you're all
[1:18:20] washed up why are you not doing
[1:18:21] something you used to know the sat the
[1:18:24] Lord in a moment and what was the will
[1:18:25] of God but this wise God sent prophets
[1:18:28] knew the promise of God but also knew to
[1:18:30] wait for that promise a clear-cut
[1:18:32] decision from God for his time see these
[1:18:35] parables now watch and then the time
[1:18:37] come God give it to Joshua who had
[1:18:40] stayed with him by the word and he could
[1:18:42] not trust others he could he could trust
[1:18:45] him so it will repeat amen
[1:18:50] and we've had a Joshua commissioned
[1:18:51] brother Branham had a Joshua
[1:18:52] commissioned and his word places us in
[1:18:55] the land hallelujah now we just have
