[49:26] saved and ha raised us up together and
[49:30] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[49:33] in Christ
[49:35] Jesus then verse 10 is really the one
[49:38] that I want to get to it says for we are
[49:41] his
[49:43] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[49:46] good works which God hath before
[49:49] ordained that we should walk in them
[49:53] yeah let's just pray once more Lord uh
[49:55] We've read your word and uh we just my
[49:58] God just hand everything over into your
[50:00] hands and we ask that you just lead even
[50:03] thinking of brother Ben oh God I'm not
[50:06] sure exactly the time differences or
[50:08] time zones but Lord when he's going to
[50:10] minister if he ministers Lord you just
[50:12] take full control there as well in Jesus
[50:15] name amen God bless you you may be
[50:17] seated this morning in the presence of
[50:20] God
[50:22] um
[50:24] so um
[50:26] I I I got
[50:29] inspired by a young a young
[50:31] man
[50:34] um
[50:35] uh um a couple of days ago um he had put
[50:39] up a status update on
[50:42] whats and uh it really it inspired me so
[50:48] it it sort of that that thought came to
[50:50] me uh we are in the hands of the master
[50:54] designer yeah am but my title that I've
[50:57] got here this morning
[50:59] is press the battle yes sir just keep
[51:04] pressing Hallelujah we are in the hands
[51:08] of the master design Hallelujah Lord so
[51:12] I I seen
[51:13] this is that right yeah I seen that um
[51:18] uh on on a WhatsApp
[51:20] status and uh if you can see it it's got
[51:24] some master Master designer on the left
[51:27] there and he's designing something as
[51:30] you can see he's designing something and
[51:33] on the right it really sort of just
[51:35] shows what he's designing and I'm not
[51:37] really sure what you call it Josh um but
[51:41] it's some kind of cabinet right that uh
[51:45] that he was putting
[51:46] together and uh I was I was looking at
[51:49] it um and I thought wow how powerful you
[51:56] know what I love is
[51:58] that we we we we can see
[52:02] God in the little things we can see God
[52:06] in the natural things and when I was
[52:09] just seeing this WhatsApp status come up
[52:13] I looked at it and I seen God and I seen
[52:17] myself and I seen God as this this
[52:21] designer this master designer um and and
[52:24] and it made me gave me such a confidence
[52:26] that to know that that that that I am in
[52:29] the palm of his hand yeah and that what
[52:32] whatever I'm going through in life as
[52:34] long as I believe I'm surrendered to him
[52:37] Lord he's taking me and whatever he's
[52:40] he's designed for my life uh I believe
[52:43] you know as I'm surrendered to him he's
[52:45] um he's he's doing something right and
[52:50] so so so uh when you look at this right
[52:53] on the left is the design
[52:56] and and and on the right it's part of
[53:00] the the the
[53:02] output of whatever is being designed on
[53:06] the left now if you look at it on the
[53:09] right hand side it doesn't really look
[53:12] exactly like what's on the left which is
[53:14] the
[53:15] design but if you look at it on the
[53:18] right there is work in
[53:20] progress there's there's there's things
[53:22] that still needs to be done yeah to that
[53:27] uh that that pieces of wood that needs
[53:29] to come together to make a beautiful
[53:33] cabinet but on the left hand side the
[53:37] designer has designed it and he's got
[53:41] this picture in his head and right now
[53:44] when we look at that thing we'll think
[53:45] no man it's not that's not what the
[53:48] designer designed but that thing is a
[53:50] work in progress and I looked at that
[53:54] and I see
[53:55] yes I seen a piece of wood they right
[53:58] but I seen Tas and I seen this year is
[54:02] Tas and his work in
[54:05] progress my God the great designer has
[54:09] got great plans for T but there are
[54:12] things that still needs to happen in the
[54:15] life of Taz maybe there's going to be
[54:18] some uh you know grinding or heavy
[54:22] sandpaper that's going to have to come
[54:24] across there and really send things down
[54:29] and it's going to if that piece of wood
[54:31] was um you know if it was alive and you
[54:34] take that sandpaper it might hurt it but
[54:38] there is a there's there there's an end
[54:40] product Hallelujah that this designer
[54:44] had in mind Lord and I want to see I
[54:47] think he said it will take about a week
[54:49] to get this thing completed now once
[54:52] it's completed I want you to send me a
[54:53] photo of it okay I want to see the
[54:55] outcome but you know when I looked at
[54:58] that I thought wow I am so grateful that
[55:02] I am in the hand of this master
[55:07] designer and I am you
[55:09] know for those of you that was at the
[55:11] camp you know for for a while this word
[55:15] called
[55:16] surrender it's just been so has been my
[55:20] my my theme of wanting to con stantly
[55:26] Just
[55:27] Surrender to almighty God I was I was um
[55:31] telling I was telling the young people I
[55:32] think it was last week or two weeks ago
[55:35] I was telling them that you know that
[55:36] word surrender to the world out there
[55:41] it's a it's a word of weakness it's it's
[55:44] a word that says you know what I'm
[55:46] giving up in I'm Giving Up on things but
[55:48] to a Christian that is surrendered to
[55:52] almighty God there is so so much power
[55:56] that comes with that it's a song that
[55:59] says the more that I
[56:01] Surrender the lighter my load the more
[56:05] that I just release of myself the more
[56:09] he takes control and that is what I want
[56:12] and the desire of my heart so I just
[56:16] thought I want to drop this in that we
[56:19] are in the hands of the master designer
[56:23] amen now brother Brandon would come
[56:25] sorry I can't read from there I lost my
[56:27] glasses I'll just read from here brother
[56:29] Brandon says that he is the designer so
[56:33] as you sitting here this morning he is
[56:36] our designer he knows what it takes oh
[56:41] yes sometimes we get we get faced with
[56:43] situations we get faced with life we
[56:46] sometimes question things but he is in
[56:48] control he knows what it takes for you
[56:52] and me to get to the next next level
[56:55] with him Hallelujah because you know
[56:57] that is what we do right as Christians
[57:00] as message Believers of this open book
[57:04] yeah amen we grow and and and we
[57:07] surrender so it says our design is well
[57:10] dressed in the power of his resurrection
[57:12] he is walking amongst us today in the um
[57:16] in the power of his resurrection he
[57:19] knows what it takes to put a church in
[57:24] Rapture
[57:26] order he knows it so what he wants from
[57:30] you and me just surrender to him and
[57:33] allow him to take us and to mold us and
[57:37] he takes us through schools of you know
[57:39] experiences but he's getting us ready
[57:43] this this this this this revealed word
[57:47] which we call the message of the hour is
[57:50] come and it's getting us into a
[57:53] condition to get out of the place so he
[57:56] says he he designed it he put the parts
[58:00] together here in the Bible so if you
[58:02] want to know what's happening in your
[58:04] life and and then you get confused it's
[58:07] all yeah right but I think I might have
[58:10] said it last time we need Revelation
[58:14] divine revelation from God that's right
[58:17] as we read his word and he reveals it to
[58:22] us we can then identify
[58:25] ourselves in the word and identify that
[58:28] he is putting the parts together here in
[58:31] the Bible and he says yeah just let the
[58:34] current flow through it which I believe
[58:37] is the spirit of Christ and he says and
[58:40] watch it
[58:41] operate let faith in his promised word
[58:45] of today flow through and you will see
[58:50] how it operates and I know I am
[58:53] preaching to the quiet here because the
[58:56] choir knows what we're talking about you
[58:58] see when we read these kind of quotes
[59:01] it's not just quotes that we read and we
[59:03] you know we can't we can identify with
[59:07] what we read amen and if there someone
[59:10] here yeah online wherever and you can't
[59:13] identify with what you're reading
[59:15] because I was there one day right many
[59:17] years ago I would read the quotes for
[59:19] the andd and I couldn't place myself
[59:22] there but God by his divine grace he
[59:26] came the way of tar and he opened up my
[59:30] understanding and he revealed himself to
[59:33] me and that's when I read his word I
[59:36] read these quotes I see myself and I
[59:42] identify with these with with these
[59:44] words he designed the thing he designed
[59:48] his church by the word yeah that's right
[59:51] that's what he puts together not by
[59:54] Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian or
[59:57] Pentecostal organization but by his
[1:00:02] word and you know it's so important that
[1:00:06] we've got to recognize that it's by his
[1:00:10] word amen and the more we recognize that
[1:00:13] and and and we realize that it's the
[1:00:16] word that's coming and and just bringing
[1:00:19] about changes in our lives and just
[1:00:22] molding us and transforming us we want
[1:00:26] to subject ourselves to the word we want
[1:00:29] to just surrender to
[1:00:34] him okay
[1:00:36] so I thought I wanted to just drop this
[1:00:38] in this morning um I I heard a a brother
[1:00:42] fact I heard two
[1:00:44] ministers um refer to this and I thought
[1:00:47] I wanted to just um touch on this sister
[1:00:50] hope Brenham you know brother brother
[1:00:53] Brenham would tell us in his life
[1:00:56] story of how you know the the life that
[1:00:59] he
[1:01:01] lived and uh the situations that he went
[1:01:04] through and the decisions that he had to
[1:01:06] make and uh you tell us about his his
[1:01:10] wife sister hope and you tell us
[1:01:14] how um you know things happened and she
[1:01:18] got terribly sick and uh he got the news
[1:01:21] that she's
[1:01:22] dying and how he would come to the
[1:01:26] hospital and if you go and read it in
[1:01:28] this in the life story you you you would
[1:01:30] talk about um you know he'd come there
[1:01:33] and and they'll actually tell him no you
[1:01:35] know don't don't don't don't don't go in
[1:01:37] there Ball but but he says you know I
[1:01:40] want to I need to go and see her so he
[1:01:43] says he would go he would go into the
[1:01:45] into the into the room where she's
[1:01:47] laying and he says that she's laying on
[1:01:49] the bed and she's got this sheet over
[1:01:52] her head because she had died
[1:01:55] and uh he says he's he's he's standing
[1:01:59] there and he's saying Lord I he puts his
[1:02:02] hand he puts his hand over over a fored
[1:02:05] he says and um he says Lord you know I
[1:02:09] so much
[1:02:11] desire to say goodbye to my
[1:02:14] wife and he says he says I put my hand
[1:02:17] on the head and I said oh God please now

[1:02:22] he's he's he's broken

[1:02:35] whole life is just like collapsed around
[1:02:38] him and he's standing here in front of
[1:02:41] his wife and and and he says oh God you
[1:02:43] know I I let me tell her
[1:02:47] goodbye and uh she's there and you know
[1:02:50] brother I I believe brother brandom I
[1:02:52] believe the things that he says and and
[1:02:54] and and so she's laying there and she's
[1:02:57] dead but he's he's talking to the Lord
[1:03:00] he says Lord let me tell her goodbye I
[1:03:04] don't want her to go without telling her

[1:04:17] she used was B why did you call me
[1:04:22] back mean then then and and and that in
[1:04:25] itself is just so
[1:04:27] astounding and and and and and even when

[1:23:19] he keeps his word god was determined to
[1:23:24] bring Israel out because he
[1:23:28] promised that he'd do
[1:23:31] it God has to keep his word now if you
[1:23:35] want to know where God promised it I'm
[1:23:36] not going to go into the detail of it
[1:23:38] but you can write this down Genesis
[1:23:41] 15:13 God tells Abraham that certain
[1:23:44] things are going to happen and he also
[1:23:47] says um that you're going to be you know
[1:23:51] in bondage for a couple of years but
[1:23:54] afterwards you will come out with great
[1:23:58] substance so God promise them that yeah
[1:24:02] things are going to happen but I am
[1:24:05] going to deliver you amen so God is a
[1:24:09] God that sticks to his promises
[1:24:13] Hallelujah and then brother bham goes on
[1:24:15] and
[1:24:16] says and there's going to be a
[1:24:19] church appear before him
[1:24:23] without spot or without wrinkle and I'm
[1:24:27] looking at that church a portion of that
[1:24:30] church this morning he says
[1:24:34] regardless of what we
[1:24:37] do and how much chaos we get
[1:24:42] into God is able of these stones to rise
[1:24:48] up children unto Abraham and I I wrote a
[1:24:51] promise here
[1:24:53] Ephesians 5 brother the scripture says
[1:24:56] that he might present to
[1:24:59] himself a glorious church and I'm
[1:25:03] looking at that glorious church this
[1:25:05] morning not having a spot or wrinkle or
[1:25:11] any such thing but that it should be
[1:25:14] holy and without blemish and we look at
[1:25:18] ourselves sometimes and we think man I
[1:25:21] don't measure up to that but I believe
[1:25:24] that you see when God looks at you and
[1:25:27] me he looks at us through the blood and
[1:25:30] he sees perfect Perfection he sees you
[1:25:34] perfect and uh that says you know not
[1:25:37] having a spot that that word spot is not
[1:25:41] having any fault or any moral blemish
[1:25:45] amen and that is what God has promised
[1:25:48] you and he's promised me a glor
[1:25:52] church with no
[1:25:55] faults no
[1:25:59] blemish he says now this God right so
[1:26:03] he's promised us these great
[1:26:05] promises he's promised us Perfection
[1:26:09] he's promised us adoption he's promised
[1:26:12] us a body change he's promised us a
[1:26:15] Rapture a catching way he says now I
[1:26:19] want you to
[1:26:20] notice when he finally got the Church on
[1:26:24] the Move talking about Israel children
[1:26:26] of Israel and they determined then to
[1:26:30] follow he says great signs and wonders
[1:26:35] took place and if you go and read the
[1:26:37] scripture Genesis Exodus you know you um
[1:26:40] you'll find about things that that that
[1:26:42] that took place he says on the road out
[1:26:45] there they were taking God at his word
[1:26:49] and that's what you and I are doing
[1:26:51] right as we walk walking this walk you
[1:26:54] know to towards our who wrote that
[1:26:56] someone wrote that song I'm walking
[1:26:58] towards my body change we walking right
[1:27:01] in a certain direction and uh he says on
[1:27:04] the road they were taking God at his
[1:27:05] word they left everything behind and
[1:27:08] they went on their Journey he says now
[1:27:10] it's a very strange thing that God would
[1:27:12] put his children to such a test as soon
[1:27:16] as they made the first move so we know
[1:27:18] they they they left Egypt but then he
[1:27:20] says they came to this
[1:27:23] uh uh
[1:27:25] blockage called the Red Sea now brother
[1:27:28] bam drops this in he says I say this for
[1:27:31] the benefit of those he says many lost
[1:27:34] night who accepted Christ he says don't
[1:27:39] expect the road to be a flowery bed of
[1:27:44] ease now to those seasoned Christians
[1:27:48] here today you know what I'm talking
[1:27:50] about I mean I I I I look at my life and
[1:27:53] I say Lord man the things that I win I
[1:27:57] was talking to brother um some some
[1:27:59] ministers uh uh a couple of days
[1:28:03] ago and I was saying and I say this to
[1:28:05] the to the young I'm still a young
[1:28:07] Minister but I say this to the younger
[1:28:09] younger
[1:28:10] ministers um it's not a Glory
[1:28:15] Road to
[1:28:17] minister it's not easy I mean it's easy
[1:28:21] to come into just takes take words and
[1:28:23] quotes and just throw it off and make
[1:28:25] you go crazy right but there's a
[1:28:29] life that goes with
[1:28:32] usely am and I believe and I I I say
[1:28:36] this wherever I go I believe that God
[1:28:39] has placed gifts in the
[1:28:42] body and you can sit here right remember
[1:28:47] it's not just about t standing with a
[1:28:48] minister standing here and preaching the
[1:28:50] word you can sit here
[1:28:52] and you can discern yeah so you can see
[1:28:55] by the test and I tell people I say
[1:28:58] Lord help me to be
[1:29:02] sincere help me to be to be honest to to
[1:29:06] to be open as much as I
[1:29:09] can and just to allow you to use the
[1:29:15] gift on my life Hallelujah but what I
[1:29:18] want to tell you is that especially the
[1:29:20] young ministers that it's not
[1:29:24] easy because the Lord takes you
[1:29:28] through
[1:29:30] experiences that
[1:29:32] man you don't want to go
[1:29:35] through that's right I mean as as I
[1:29:37] stand here and I I was now the other day
[1:29:39] I was sitting and I was just looking
[1:29:41] back on my
[1:29:42] life and I said man the things that I
[1:29:47] had to go
[1:29:48] through where times when you would feel
[1:29:51] sorry so
[1:29:53] broken and times when and I've never
[1:29:57] ever really reached a point where I want
[1:29:58] to give
[1:30:00] up but there are times when you just you
[1:30:03] feel so man it's like man it's so hard
[1:30:07] to move
[1:30:08] forward but it's through those times
[1:30:10] where he comes and he he he he heals you
[1:30:14] or he he helps your hearts of your heart
[1:30:16] is
[1:30:17] broken emotionally you are just you just
[1:30:20] finished but he comes and then he he
[1:30:23] picks you up and then he he takes you
[1:30:26] and he just you know puts that ointment
[1:30:29] over you just to soothe you and to help
[1:30:32] you to heal so I just want to drop this
[1:30:36] into the and I know there's some
[1:30:38] beautiful wonderful young Brothers here
[1:30:41] that's that that's in the ministry just
[1:30:44] allow
[1:30:45] yourself to be surrendered Hallelujah
[1:30:49] and the Lord is going to take you also
[1:30:50] through schools of experience but when
[1:30:53] he does that just walk under the
[1:30:57] atmosphere of surrender to him because
[1:31:01] you know as I I I've discovered this
[1:31:03] right where you're going through
[1:31:05] something it's so hard and it seems so
[1:31:08] impossible to break through but the more
[1:31:12] that I Just Surrender and that in itself
[1:31:15] is hard but it's possible the more that
[1:31:18] I just surrender to him I find him he
[1:31:23] just takes me and he helps me Hallelujah
[1:31:26] through that and then when I look back
[1:31:30] and I say man T how did you manage to
[1:31:35] come through that and then you
[1:31:39] realize that is nothing but the grace of
[1:31:43] almighty God and then I look back and I
[1:31:46] say Lord as much as I did not enjoy it I
[1:31:52] am thankful because you have taught me
[1:31:56] so much so that's why I can come here
[1:31:59] and I can stand and I can speak of an
[1:32:03] experience where I've seen what he's
[1:32:05] done in my life so brother Bram says you
[1:32:08] know for those new Christians who
[1:32:10] accepted Christ he says don't expect a
[1:32:13] flowery bed of ease it's going to be a
[1:32:15] rough and a rugged road but remember
[1:32:19] this he promised
[1:32:22] that he will be with
[1:32:26] you there was a time when brother
[1:32:28] brandham needed to hear those
[1:32:31] words where you know the the the devil
[1:32:34] was coming and telling him a whole lot
[1:32:36] of
[1:32:37] nonsense and then he says then I heard
[1:32:40] the most sweetest voice that says the
[1:32:44] never failing presence of Jesus Christ
[1:32:50] is with you
[1:32:52] and I want to just drop that over you
[1:32:55] this morning don't forget
[1:32:58] that doesn't matter where we find
[1:33:01] ourselves he's there somebody actually
[1:33:05] used this words and I hope it's okay for
[1:33:06] me to say this you know how it is
[1:33:08] sometimes we find ourselves caught up in
[1:33:12] addictions now there's there's drug
[1:33:14] addictions and there's all sorts of
[1:33:16] addictions and and one of the big things
[1:33:18] I've discovered actually in in in in the
[1:33:20] message sort of community or is is where
[1:33:24] the devil is really hitting a lot of
[1:33:26] people is pornography addiction and um
[1:33:30] and and you know and you look at that
[1:33:32] and you say Lord you know and and people
[1:33:34] that you know people that are addicted
[1:33:36] to things they they don't want to do it
[1:33:38] they they they they they want to get out
[1:33:40] of it but you know then they just get
[1:33:43] sucked back in but somebody actually use
[1:33:45] the words and says even in your
[1:33:49] addictions he's there yeah so it doesn't
[1:33:54] mean that you know so you failed God and
[1:33:57] you miserably failed him now the devil
[1:34:00] uses that and says now you cannot talk
[1:34:03] to him because he's an Angry God who did
[1:34:07] wrong so even if you go to him he's not
[1:34:09] going to listen to you don't listen to
[1:34:13] that lie from the devil come on now
[1:34:15] because he's lying to
[1:34:17] you when we make a mistake come on get
[1:34:22] up amen and if you can't get up in that
[1:34:26] state you say Lord help me amen help me
[1:34:31] Father Hallelujah I'm I'm weak but I
[1:34:34] need your
[1:34:36] strength name
[1:34:39] Jesus say if there's anybody even on the
[1:34:41] live stream here this morning and you
[1:34:43] you maybe find yourself in an addiction
[1:34:45] and you you you you you you think that
[1:34:47] because of that now God doesn't want to
[1:34:50] hear you he's a god of love am he
[1:34:54] doesn't condone the addiction he doesn't
[1:34:58] condone and and say you know oh it's
[1:35:00] okay for you to do that no but he loves
[1:35:03] you amen he wants to get us out of
[1:35:06] that he wants us to
[1:35:10] grow
[1:35:12] amen so I don't know where that came
[1:35:15] from maybe somebody needed to hear
[1:35:19] that don't let the devil tell you that
[1:35:24] God will not listen to
[1:35:28] you he's a father that loves you Lord I
[1:35:33] mean just think of it think just think
[1:35:35] of it bring it to the
[1:35:36] Natural I've got my children and I mean
[1:35:39] i' I've got I've got teenagers in my
[1:35:41] home and it's uh kind of
[1:35:44] toughy for those of you that's got
[1:35:47] teenagers it's not easy it's not easy
[1:35:51] and I know I know of stuff that my kids
[1:35:54] are doing and they think that you know
[1:35:57] we don't
[1:35:59] know but God has given us discernment
[1:36:02] Hallelujah right we we we we know things
[1:36:05] but the Lord has also given us wisdom
[1:36:08] yeah that we don't just fly off the
[1:36:10] handle and just go and fight and just go
[1:36:14] crazy so we know what's happening
[1:36:17] there but the Lord gives us Grace
[1:36:19] because as a father
[1:36:22] you love your children amen and you want
[1:36:26] the best for them amen so you want to
[1:36:30] you can you see there's a
[1:36:32] problem and it's just it's you you
[1:36:35] because God is matur
[1:36:38] us we can look at that and say you know
[1:36:41] what I was there I know what it's like
[1:36:45] you still at a at a level where you
[1:36:48] haven't matured yet but as a father and
[1:36:52] as a mother we are there to help you so
[1:36:57] sometimes even my kids and they probably
[1:37:00] will listen to this as well when when
[1:37:03] when we see things and we we discern
[1:37:05] things the Lord gives us Grace to help
[1:37:09] them without them knowing that we're
[1:37:12] helping them with that situation so I
[1:37:15] say Lord give us as parents that Grace
[1:37:18] and just just that ability to use
[1:37:22] wisdom when dealing uh with our children
[1:37:25] and dealing with things so I want to
[1:37:28] repeat myself if we find ourselves down
[1:37:32] there the devil will tell us God doesn't
[1:37:35] want to hear you I want to cancel that
[1:37:38] in the name of Jesus Amen I want you to
[1:37:41] know God loves you
[1:37:45] amen they are if you go through the
[1:37:48] quotes of brother Bradon the sermons he
[1:37:49] would meet people that think that they
[1:37:53] have just reached the end of everything
[1:37:56] there's no Grace for them but I want you
[1:37:58] to know that the grace of God is
[1:38:02] available amen just call out that's all
[1:38:07] we do Hallelujah call out brother
[1:38:10] Brandon says if you notice as soon as
[1:38:12] they got started and left Egypt on their
[1:38:16] Road they were following the word of God
[1:38:18] by the letter following the prophet
[1:38:21] following the angel of the Lord
[1:38:24] following the pillar of fire trouble set
[1:38:27] in right away and they were brought to a
[1:38:30] place where there was no place to run
[1:38:34] but it's in those situations and you
[1:38:37] know this we go we see God steps on the
[1:38:41] scene and we see how he just moves
[1:38:46] things he either you would open up the
[1:38:49] Red Sea to allow you to go through
[1:38:51] through or he'll do certain things and
[1:38:53] when we look back man he's been there
[1:38:57] he's helped me it seemed impossible but
[1:39:01] you know God is God and you know what
[1:39:03] what I found out and and and if we just
[1:39:05] look at our lives and we've decided to
[1:39:08] follow Jesus we've we've we've made it
[1:39:11] our our you know uh our our our ultimate
[1:39:15] goal we are totally sold out to this
[1:39:19] message I am and I know you are I know I
[1:39:22] speak to many of you and I know you are
[1:39:24] totally totally totally sold out but we
[1:39:27] know that the enemy obviously wants to
[1:39:29] attack us he wants to fight us and what
[1:39:32] he does and I I just drop this in I
[1:39:34] won't dwell too much on it but what what
[1:39:36] I've noticed um is that you know he he
[1:39:40] he the enemy is making it so hard for us
[1:39:44] as
[1:39:45] Christians to be real Christians for us
[1:39:48] as Christians to just to to serve God
[1:39:52] freely yeah come on there's so many
[1:39:54] things that's that's
[1:39:56] happening around us yeah and we know
[1:40:00] that it's the God of this evil age that
[1:40:02] it's it's making it harder for
[1:40:05] Christians to uphold the principles of
[1:40:09] the Bible making it hard for Christians
[1:40:12] even to go and witness out there on you
[1:40:16] know and and uh the when we look at it
[1:40:19] and we look at there there's lots of
[1:40:21] laws and and I'm not going to draw draw
[1:40:23] too much on this but there there's lots
[1:40:25] of laws that that that that's coming in
[1:40:29] um and and if you look at it and and if
[1:40:31] you you sort of see the spirit behind it
[1:40:34] you realize that these laws that's
[1:40:37] coming in it's aimed at you and it's
[1:40:40] aimed at me you are being targeted
[1:40:44] because we have decided to follow
[1:40:48] Jesus um in this
[1:40:51] open book am that's right so so so so
[1:40:56] you and I we
[1:40:59] are very
[1:41:01] important and we are very dangerous yes
[1:41:05] in the sight of the enemy that's right
[1:41:08] you see he hates
[1:41:10] you and he makes no bones about that
[1:41:14] that's right because he knows that when
[1:41:17] you get a true revelation of who you
[1:41:23] are then he's got to
[1:41:26] go and he realizes if you know who you
[1:41:30] are that you then will realize and know
[1:41:33] that you have an
[1:41:35] authority over him amen but he doesn't
[1:41:39] want you to know that so he tries to put
[1:41:42] you under a pressure that's right you
[1:41:46] now I I'm going to drop this in and I'll
[1:41:48] move
[1:41:49] on spirits don't
[1:41:52] die now I said what's happening in the
[1:41:56] world is that there are laws and it's
[1:41:58] Global you know what what they call it
[1:42:01] this woke woke culture kind of thing
[1:42:03] right so there are laws there's these
[1:42:05] things happening right and laws are
[1:42:08] being put into place to get to you and
[1:42:10] to
[1:42:11] me and you realize that it's
[1:42:15] obviously evil spirits at
[1:42:18] play and if you go into the book of
[1:42:21] Daniel now I won't I won't go into the
[1:42:23] detail of it but Daniel chapter
[1:42:27] 6 you will find that same Spirit there
[1:42:31] is at work today because if you go to
[1:42:34] Daniel chapter 6 and you just go and
[1:42:36] read through it you will find that there
[1:42:39] were people they wanted to get to
[1:42:42] Daniel because they hated Daniel because
[1:42:46] of the stand that he took for the word
[1:42:49] of his day Hallelujah and what they did
[1:42:53] they went to the king and said oh King
[1:42:55] live forever d d all these things and
[1:42:58] said King maybe you should make a
[1:43:01] decree that anyone that you know uh that
[1:43:04] that that comes up against uh you know
[1:43:07] whatever this law is will be casted into
[1:43:09] the Den of
[1:43:11] Lions so I encourage you for homework
[1:43:14] whatever when you go home go and read
[1:43:17] Daniel chapter 6 and then you will find
[1:43:20] out that that what happened there it's
[1:43:23] happening today am so I just thought
[1:43:26] I'll drop that in but the enemy wants to
[1:43:29] crush you he wants to prevent you from
[1:43:34] coming to that
[1:43:36] realization of who you are and I'm going
[1:43:40] to repeat myself but this revealed word
[1:43:43] as I'm reading it it's telling me who I
[1:43:48] am brother Brandon would come and you
[1:43:51] use that word it says that you and I we
[1:43:54] are becoming a
[1:43:56] Powerhouse right and then if we go into
[1:43:59] the scriptures and we and we read and we
[1:44:02] discover that even
[1:44:05] nature nature creation is waiting for
[1:44:11] you and me to step forward amen that's
[1:44:14] right so if you go to Romans I'll read
[1:44:17] this Romans 8:19 it says for the earnest
[1:44:20] expectation of the creature wait for the
[1:44:25] manifestation of the sons of God for we
[1:44:30] know that the whole creation granth and
[1:44:34] to and travaileth in pain together until
[1:44:39] now yes so creation Brother Andy is
[1:44:44] waiting for you and me as Sons and
[1:44:48] Daughters of God to step forward amen
[1:44:51] and to serve our purpose Hallelujah to
[1:44:54] step into our position amen nature is
[1:44:58] groaning come on creation is
[1:45:02] groaning for you and for me in fact that
[1:45:05] word expectation it refers to an anxious
[1:45:10] impatient and eager and persistent
[1:45:15] expectation that is what nature is under
[1:45:18] nature is anxious oh boy because n you
[1:45:21] see
[1:45:22] nature remembers oh yes where it
[1:45:28] was come on now so I wrot here said
[1:45:31] nature knows what it had in the
[1:45:35] beginning before the
[1:45:38] fall and he's groaning to go back to
[1:45:42] that
[1:45:44] yes nature is groaning for the
[1:45:48] manifestation of the sons of God because
[1:45:52] nature knows that you and I brother the
[1:45:56] AR we hold the key yeah that's right to
[1:45:59] they return back to that
[1:46:03] Perfection because that was a perfect
[1:46:07] world where Adam had Dominion you and
[1:46:13] nature knows what it was
[1:46:17] like Hallelujah come on and nature is
[1:46:23] groaning and under and
[1:46:26] anxious and a
[1:46:28] persistant
[1:46:30] expectation for you and
[1:46:33] I to step forward amen and the key so I
[1:46:38] said we hold the key and and I believe
[1:46:40] one of that Keys is and this word is
[1:46:43] coming to show us who you are who I am
[1:46:49] and that's why it's so important that we
[1:46:51] sit like this that we receive the word
[1:46:55] that we pull and we say Lord speak to me
[1:46:59] father I want to know who I
[1:47:04] am so nature knows and I'm was going to
[1:47:06] read something nature knows that there
[1:47:08] will come a time where you will no
[1:47:11] longer need to just quote the quotes
[1:47:15] right and say brother brandham said this
[1:47:17] and brother brandham said that even you
[1:47:20] might not even have to pray but you will
[1:47:23] be able to speak like Adam remember the
[1:47:26] Brandon would dramatize with how Adam
[1:47:28] would speak to the tree and say you know
[1:47:30] what can you just move that way or you
[1:47:33] know speak to this and nature knows that
[1:47:36] you hold that key and you you you will
[1:47:39] just speak go forward and heaven will
[1:47:43] back up what you say now that brother
[1:47:46] arand is what's happening within us but
[1:47:49] we need need to walk under that
[1:47:53] atmosphere of appreciation number one
[1:47:56] obviously and just of surrender to him
[1:48:00] because this word is training you and
[1:48:04] it's training me and it's preparing us
[1:48:08] and it's it's molding our characters and
[1:48:11] the more we die of
[1:48:13] ourselves the more he loves and the more
[1:48:17] he takes control see the problem with
[1:48:21] man is man has forgotten who he is but
[1:48:26] this word is taking us back this message
[1:48:31] is turning our hearts and is coming and
[1:48:34] reminding us who we are that's right
[1:48:38] stir up so this is a glorious time

[1:48:57] amen and you might not maybe maybe you
[1:48:59] might not see it now and you might not
[1:49:02] understand it but the more you feed the
[1:49:05] more you feed on him oh yes the more he
[1:49:09] reveals and the more he shows you the
[1:49:13] Glorious time that we are in amen that's
[1:49:16] right you see our focus is not on what's
[1:49:19] Happening out there amen yes we are
[1:49:22] aware of what's happening out there and
[1:49:24] yes the world is getting more and more
[1:49:26] evil and yes things are going crazy and
[1:49:30] yes the laws of the country is happening
[1:49:32] but our focus is what is happening
[1:49:35] within us our focus is on this revealed
[1:49:40] and precious word which I call we call
[1:49:44] the message of the hour this message is
[1:49:48] it's it's it's doing doing something
[1:49:51] with
[1:49:53] in I wrote to you I said it is this
[1:49:57] revealed word that is showing us who we
[1:50:00] are and it's guiding us through this
[1:50:04] crazy world and showing us how to
[1:50:08] overcome amen that's right because we
[1:50:11] can overcome yeah amen you are
[1:50:15] Overcomers that's right don't let
[1:50:17] anybody tell you anything different
[1:50:19] don't let the friends tell you the devil
[1:50:22] you can overcome this revealed word this
[1:50:25] message is showing us how to GA us in
[1:50:28] our homes how to you know Simple Stuff
[1:50:31] how to rear and how to teach our
[1:50:35] children how to fight against the powers
[1:50:38] of Darkness it's teaching us how to grow
[1:50:43] it's showing us how to mature am Jesus
[1:50:47] says be ye therefore perfect
[1:50:50] this message is showing us how to attain
[1:50:55] Perfection amen but this message wants
[1:50:59] us to subject ourselves to God to this
[1:51:04] revealed word and as we do that um he's
[1:51:08] leading us amen into that direction
[1:51:11] Hallelujah you see we heard about Joshua
[1:51:13] right and the halls of Jericho that fell
[1:51:16] we read it in the Bible we read about
[1:51:19] Joshua that spoke to the Sun and said
[1:51:21] Son stand still in fact he also spoke to
[1:51:24] the moon and said Moon you do this we
[1:51:27] heard of Moses right who commanded the
[1:51:29] Red Sea to open Moses who called for
[1:51:32] flies he he called for frogs he he spoke
[1:51:36] the word yeah and nature obeyed
[1:51:41] him impossible but true amen amen we
[1:51:45] read about an Elijah this is all in the
[1:51:48] Bible right who stopped the
[1:51:50] rain and then he called for rain yeah
[1:51:54] that's right we read about and this was
[1:51:56] Elijah a man the Bible says of light
[1:51:59] passions like you and me yeah who got
[1:52:02] angry who gets upset but this man was so
[1:52:06] surrendered to God that he was able to
[1:52:09] do what we thought was impossible
[1:52:10] Hallelujah Elisha who parted the Waters
[1:52:13] of Jordan and and he he he made an iron
[1:52:18] ax head that dropped to the bottom he
[1:52:22] got that thing to
[1:52:24] swim go read in your Bible he performed
[1:52:28] which we think as man that's
[1:52:31] impossible but he proved that what's
[1:52:35] impossible to man it's possible with God
[1:52:40] Amen you know and for if you bring it
[1:52:44] down close we he we read about a William
[1:52:48] brandham that per formed exploits of
[1:52:51] Faith a William brandom that would speak
[1:52:54] to a fish that has been dead for a few
[1:52:58] hours and Speak Life into a dead fish
[1:53:02] and that fish would swim away a a a
[1:53:06] William brandom that God gave the the
[1:53:09] the
[1:53:10] grace to speak squirrels into existence
[1:53:16] amen a a a a a a humble man that would
[1:53:20] go into the home of of sister hatti
[1:53:22] right and because hatti right said the
[1:53:25] right thing yeah could say hatti
[1:53:28] whatever you need right now you tell me
[1:53:32] you'll speak
[1:53:33] it a man that could speak to the storm
[1:53:38] so all these things are things that we
[1:53:40] think is so impossible to
[1:53:45] men but these things which I
[1:53:48] mentioned they are all
[1:53:51] witnesses to show the
[1:53:55] possibilities of God in you amen because
[1:54:01] we know that William brandham was the
[1:54:04] first wave sheave to show that there are
[1:54:09] more coming yes amen that's right but
[1:54:14] these were men and women like us like
[1:54:18] you and me yeah that's
[1:54:22] right people that had their ups and
[1:54:25] downs
[1:54:27] yeah they had their
[1:54:29] disappointments like we
[1:54:32] do they had their
[1:54:35] victories was it
[1:54:37] Elisha it got so angry one time he
[1:54:40] called for she Bez to come and kill
[1:54:44] children little kids and all they did
[1:54:47] was they were making fun of the man of
[1:54:48] God and he got
[1:54:53] upset so this word and all these things
[1:54:57] that we read about Joshua and Moses and
[1:54:59] Peter and Elijah and brother brandham
[1:55:01] and there are so many other testimonies
[1:55:04] of
[1:55:04] today that God allows us to
[1:55:08] experience to let us know that there is
[1:55:12] something within you and me that that
[1:55:15] that can at some point just step
[1:55:18] forward and I I'll close it shortly you
[1:55:21] know I wrote you I said and this is this
[1:55:23] for me is one of the big things right
[1:55:24] now that that the Lord is dealing on me
[1:55:26] with me on I wrote here it's it's about
[1:55:29] surrender and I I spoke this at the camp
[1:55:32] as well and I bring it you again it's
[1:55:34] about
[1:55:36] surrender it's about just giving myself
[1:55:41] over to him and the more I give myself
[1:55:45] to him the more he shows me who I am and
[1:55:49] I I wrote you actually I said The more
[1:55:51] you surrender to this revealed word it
[1:55:54] can lead to what and I wrote it here I
[1:55:57] said it can lead to that super anointing
[1:56:01] yes now brother Brandon will talk about
[1:56:03] the super anointing and I I'll read that
[1:56:07] and we'll begin a musicians can come as
[1:56:09] well and we we'll finish off here
[1:56:10] shortly but brother Brandon would would
[1:56:12] talk and I'll just go through this he
[1:56:14] will he'll speak in my new
[1:56:17] ministry now remember my tit is press
[1:56:21] the
[1:56:21] battle just keep
[1:56:25] pressing we are in the hands of the
[1:56:28] master
[1:56:30] designer so brother brandom would talk
[1:56:32] about in my new ministry and if you
[1:56:35] haven't listened to it I would encourage
[1:56:38] you go and listen to it he speak he
[1:56:42] speaks a few things and he says now um
[1:56:45] and here he's talking about you know the
[1:56:47] the the Squirtles that God
[1:56:50] allowed him to speak into existence he
[1:56:54] says you know you know how people can
[1:56:58] doubt he says but you want to be sure
[1:57:01] you don't want to do anything unless you
[1:57:03] are positive and then you know what
[1:57:05] you're doing he says I rubbed my face a
[1:57:08] little and I looked perfectly eyeshot
[1:57:12] and he says so I went down on the side
[1:57:14] of the hill and I said Lord it is
[1:57:17] written in your word that the mouth of
[1:57:20] two or three Witnesses let every word be
[1:57:24] established I said if that was
[1:57:28] you forgive me of my
[1:57:33] stupidness but I pray that you give me
[1:57:37] another squirrel like
[1:57:40] that and I said then I'll believe you
[1:57:45] that it's you and the devil won't have
[1:57:49] any room to say that it just happened
[1:57:52] that way so he had spoken a squirrel and
[1:57:55] he shot it and he was a bit confused he
[1:57:57] says just in a moment he says here comes
[1:58:00] that I call it brother brandham says
[1:58:03] super
[1:58:04] anointing he says it it swept over again
[1:58:09] and I was almost off my
[1:58:12] feet and brother bam heard these words
[1:58:15] say what you
[1:58:17] will and it will be given to you now
[1:58:22] this is brother Brandon and the Lord is
[1:58:24] showing him what is possible but also
[1:58:28] showing you and me what is
[1:58:31] possible he says and I said there shall
[1:58:35] be another young fox squirrel sitting
[1:58:40] right there and I took my finger down
[1:58:44] and looked around through the woods and
[1:58:46] looked back and there sit the fox
[1:58:52] squirrel looking right at me again
[1:58:57] brother brandham says I shot that one
[1:59:00] and picked him up and brother brandham
[1:59:03] says how was trembling so God allowed
[1:59:07] brother brandham to experience this and
[1:59:11] then he goes on and he says now he goes
[1:59:13] to the home of of sister hatti right and
[1:59:16] and and and he's giving he's giving the
[1:59:19] testimony and now I know that you know
[1:59:21] these things right but some I just felt
[1:59:23] in my heart just to bring this back to
[1:59:25] your remembrance and just to remind you
[1:59:27] about these beautiful realities of God
[1:59:31] he says he's sitting in the home of
[1:59:33] sister hatti and he says I'm he's giving
[1:59:35] this testimony and his sister Hatty is
[1:59:38] sitting there crying and she didn't say
[1:59:40] a word and he said and she said as
[1:59:43] brother Brandon was talking she says
[1:59:46] that's nothing but the truth so she's
[1:59:51] heing brother brandom giving
[1:59:55] testimony and her
[1:59:57] attitude said Lord Brother brand that's
[2:00:02] nothing but the truth and God
[2:00:08] appreciated that attitude Hallelujah and
[2:00:12] I say Lord help us to have an attitude
[2:00:17] that you will be pleased with amen
[2:00:20] especially as the word Goes Forth as the
[2:00:24] word is being preached Lord let me have
[2:00:27] the right receiving attitude and she
[2:00:32] said the brother brandom says she said
[2:00:36] the right
[2:00:38] thing and then he makes reference he
[2:00:41] says just like Banks said down there and
[2:00:46] I want to go look at what banks said and
[2:00:49] Banks and and his brother and brother
[2:00:52] Brandon was on that boat and that fish
[2:00:55] was laying dead on that water and Banks
[2:00:58] and his brother was testifying and they
[2:01:01] said that they want to go and testify to
[2:01:04] somebody about the grace of God and God
[2:01:08] was pleased with that so I say Lord help
[2:01:12] us to say the right thing Hallelujah but
[2:01:17] I believe that we need to what will help
[2:01:20] us is walking under that atmosphere of
[2:01:24] surrender Amen to our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:28] and brother bam says she said the right
[2:01:29] thing just like bang said down there I
[2:01:32] Heard a Voice as it swept from my ears
[2:01:36] like up into the hoods Mrs Wright
[2:01:39] sitting back there with a little girl
[2:01:41] was trying to interpret what e said I
[2:01:43] couldn't hear Mrs wght brother bam says
[2:01:45] and when haty right said that that's
[2:01:48] nothing nothing but the truth brother
[2:01:52] bam says and that super anointing swept
[2:01:55] over me and said tell hatti that she's
[2:02:02] found Grace in the sight of God now I
[2:02:06] believe it was more than just what
[2:02:09] sister Hatty wght said yes that was
[2:02:12] important but it was what was going on
[2:02:15] inside of them because it's easy for us
[2:02:18] to to say stuff but hat right sat there
[2:02:23] under an atmosphere and an attitude of
[2:02:26] surrender to God and she's hearing these
[2:02:30] awesome things and she's saying brother
[2:02:32] the plum that's nothing but the truth
[2:02:35] and God sees her heart God hears what
[2:02:38] she says and says tell hatti that she's
[2:02:41] found Grace in the sight of God tell her
[2:02:45] to ask whatever she wants
[2:02:51] and for those of us that know what
[2:02:52] happened there brother Brandon told you
[2:02:54] you could have you can ask for a million
[2:02:57] doar and it will be there but you see
[2:03:01] hatti had the heart of a
[2:03:04] mother she had the heart of a parent and
[2:03:08] her desire like all of us as parents her
[2:03:12] desire was the salvation of her children
[2:03:16] Oh Glory and because was hatti right had
[2:03:21] the right even a surname so the
[2:03:26] right attitude
[2:03:29] Hallelujah God was so pleased with the
[2:03:34] right
[2:03:36] attitude that he swept in and he said
[2:03:40] hatti yes's a blank
[2:03:45] check whatever you want Hatty it's
[2:03:50] yours and my Prophet will speak it and
[2:03:54] it will happen she said the right thing
[2:03:59] amen she
[2:04:01] surrendered to the
[2:04:03] word that she
[2:04:06] heard and
[2:04:08] she benefited amen from that yes I say
[2:04:13] Lord help
[2:04:15] us as we pressing the battle
[2:04:19] as we knowing that we are in the hands
[2:04:22] of the master
[2:04:25] designer help us help us to walk under
[2:04:32] that
[2:04:33] atmosphere of
[2:04:35] surrender and to receive the word to
[2:04:40] agree with the word and to say that is
[2:04:46] nothing but the truth
[2:04:53] the musicians you you can
[2:04:55] come you know I'll I'll just finish I'll
[2:04:58] just say this one few things
[2:05:08] here I want to just encourage you this
[2:05:13] morning
[2:05:15] keep pressing
[2:05:17] on
[2:05:20] we thought we thought that
[2:05:24] 2023 was
[2:05:27] hard and it was
[2:05:29] hot it was
[2:05:33] crazy if if I should ask each one of you
[2:05:37] how was your

[2:05:42] will say it was it was
[2:05:45] hot and
[2:05:47] 2024 it will not get any
[2:05:51] easier
[2:05:53] but I believe that as we
[2:05:58] just allow
[2:06:00] him to take us in to just move us in the
[2:06:05] right directions and as we just continue
[2:06:09] to

[2:06:14] us
[2:06:16] navigate um this is word I used this
[2:06:20] this maze that we call
[2:06:23] life but he's helping us to
[2:06:28] navigate through this maze that we call
[2:06:31] life and there will come times when
[2:06:34] we're just going to feel man it's so
[2:06:40] hard when you feel like
[2:06:43] that just
[2:06:45] remember the never failing PR presence
[2:06:49] of Jesus Christ is with you amen he's
[2:06:55] there and I hope it's okay for me to say
[2:06:57] this but he's there even in people's
[2:07:03] addictions he's there you see we are in
[2:07:07] an awesome
[2:07:09] season we are in an awesome
[2:07:13] time we are in a season of the
[2:07:16] rapture we are in a season season of
[2:07:19] adoption and these are awesome words but
[2:07:23] but but but there's so much power Behind
[2:07:26] these things we we are in a season of
[2:07:31] perfection and and and and you know
[2:07:34] especially to the young people if you if

[2:07:49] because it's him that comes and he will
[2:07:53] reveal to you as an
[2:07:56] individual where we are and he will
[2:08:00] reveal more of himself to you and to me
[2:08:04] and the more he reveals the more Taz
[2:08:09] wants to
[2:08:10] surrender so in
[2:08:14] closing press the
[2:08:16] battle stop press the battle
[2:08:20] The Voice told brother
[2:08:22] Brandon just keep pressing I'll just
[2:08:26] read that and I'll close it with
[2:08:30] this he says just keep
[2:08:35] pressing if you only knew what was at
[2:08:39] the end of the
[2:08:41] road and right now this word is showing
[2:08:44] us what's at the end of the road what we
[2:08:48] can look forward
[2:08:50] to
[2:08:52] so I trust in the broken up way that the
[2:08:55] Lord just allowed me to speak to you
[2:08:58] this morning Hallelujah that you will
[2:09:01] just keep
[2:09:03] pressing keep supporting each
[2:09:08] other keep on encouraging each other we
[2:09:11] need each
[2:09:12] other I read a quote one time where the
[2:09:15] brandham said um he was at a church
[2:09:19] and uh he said I heard the pastor say
[2:09:22] that people need
[2:09:25] encouragement and I thought and I read
[2:09:27] that I thought yes that's so true we
[2:09:30] need each
[2:09:31] other we need to encourage each
[2:09:35] other we need we need to show each other
[2:09:39] that we are
[2:09:40] there and regardless of I was listening
[2:09:44] to a testimony of a
[2:09:45] brother that was really struggling
[2:09:49] a brother from
[2:09:51] Zimbabwe he said he used to get together
[2:09:54] with some brothers they used to go pray
[2:09:57] up in the
[2:09:59] mountains but he says what they agreed
[2:10:03] was before they would start
[2:10:07] praying they would have a little
[2:10:09] conversation amongst
[2:10:12] themselves and they would in that on
[2:10:16] that mountain with the four or five of
[2:10:19] them that would be a safe space for
[2:10:23] them so they would speak to each
[2:10:26] other and they would be honest and
[2:10:30] totally honest and tell each
[2:10:33] other about the problems and the
[2:10:36] struggles that they face but what they
[2:10:39] agreed was we're not going to go and
[2:10:42] take your story and blast it out there
[2:10:45] but we're going to take it and we're
[2:10:47] going to pray pray together for each
[2:10:50] other and that brother would say how
[2:10:53] that helped him to get deliverance from
[2:10:58] a few things that he was struggling with
[2:11:01] so I encourage
[2:11:03] you you are a very encouraging Church
[2:11:07] you are a very encouraging group of
[2:11:11] Believers but let the Lord just continue
[2:11:14] to take you wherever you are let him
[2:11:17] take you higher amen and God bless you
[2:11:21] Hallelujah love you very much you can
[2:11:24] see my heart if I could take it out
[2:11:26] you'll see you'll see how much we love
