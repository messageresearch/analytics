[4:02] a good time in the Lord this morning I
[4:04] can feel already feel a great atmosphere

[4:08] atmosphere that we're going to receive
[4:10] what we expect this morning so um praise
[4:13] the lord it's good to be alive you happy
[4:14] to be alive who's happy to be

[4:25] breath we can worship God this morning
[4:29] that's such a wonderful ful thing to be
[4:30] alive to have opportunity to serve God
[4:32] and to to live I'm so grateful for life
[4:35] and for the you know all the things that
[4:37] we have we even in this modern society
[4:41] we have so many things that make our
[4:42] life easier when was the last time you
[4:45] washed clothes over like a we used to
[4:46] have an old kind of washboard when I was
[4:49] a young fell we were I'm not old we were
[4:52] just very
[4:53] poor and we had an agitat washing
[4:56] machine and we used to have to the this
[4:58] machine just went
[5:00] and wash the clothes barely wash them
[5:01] and then there was like a roller there's
[5:03] two wheels and you had to put the
[5:05] washing through there to dry it out
[5:07] before you hung
[5:09] it yeah and it would mangle your fingers
[5:11] cuz you you put your fingers so your
[5:13] fingers would get caught in the wheels
[5:14] who had one of those yeah
[5:17] man and it would go but when the machine
[5:21] washing machine broke which was half of
[5:23] the time we live way out in the country
[5:25] then it was like a washboard mom would
[5:27] have a washboard and she' be like
[5:28] scrubbing these clothes on a
[5:31] washboard but we don't have that issue
[5:35] anymore and sometimes we don't
[5:37] appreciate you know I wonder often
[5:39] wonder you know when we complain a bit
[5:41] in this
[5:43] Society the Lord God sees all the Earth
[5:45] and he can compare one with the other
[5:47] and he sees us oh God I'm going through
[5:50] such a hardship my washing machine
[5:52] broke you know for real and there's
[5:56] someone in another part of the of the
[5:57] world that maybe they're they're they
[6:01] they can't even find a morsel of food to
[6:03] keep their body alive or they're in some
[6:05] War torn country mangled somewhere and
[6:08] and and our biggest trial you know is
[6:11] our washing machine broke and we maybe
[6:12] don't have enough money to get a new
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] one I mean to us it may be a problem but
[6:18] we just got to make sure we are always
[6:20] so grateful for what we have you know

[39:05] Aaron's bed that went down to the skirts
[39:07] of his garments as the Jew of Heron and

[39:36] amen amen amen uh so Paul is admonishing
[39:40] the Galatians the Lord is speaking to us

[39:44] well-doing for in due season we shall
[39:46] reap if we faint not as we have
[39:49] therefore opportunity let us do good
[39:51] unto all men especially unto them who
[39:53] are of the household of faith amen we
[39:57] have an opportunity today we have an
[39:59] opportunity in our lives Amen to do good
[40:01] to all men especially into the household
[40:03] of faith amen let's just approach our
[40:04] lord Jesus in a word of prayer amen this
[40:07] morning if you have a need just want to
[40:08] slip your hand up to the Lord say Lord
[40:10] remember me Hallelujah gracious father
[40:12] we want to thank you so much as we bow
[40:14] our heads one more time in your presence
[40:16] we thank you that truly Lord you are the
[40:18] almighty God the creator of heavens and
[40:20] earth you are the God of all power the
[40:22] God of all Grace the God of all love we
[40:24] thank you as we have read your word this
[40:26] morning we know that any mortal that can
[40:28] read can read your word but Lord what
[40:30] we're depending upon is you the great
[40:32] author to come step out of History step
[40:33] on the scene once again and anoint your
[40:36] word Lord Jesus may it live in our
[40:37] hearts may you come and touch Our Lives
[40:39] May as we approach your throne of grace
[40:41] oh God may your great Mercy come and
[40:44] overshadow us change us make us new Lord
[40:47] grant it we love you we thank you for
[40:48] this opportunity to be in your presence
[40:50] together as a redeem people washed in
[40:52] your blood we want to ask as always be
[40:54] at those who couldn't make it today be
[40:56] their portion thank you Lord in Jesus
[40:58] Christ's name we commit the service down
[41:00] to your hands we surrender it Lord into
[41:02] your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[41:03] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[41:06] you you may have your seats uh this
[41:08] morning amen so I want to continue about
[41:10] this thought here you know because we
[41:12] got to look at the the magnitude of
[41:15] unity the magnitude of unity I want to
[41:18] talk about this this morning because as
[41:21] as David would say here and this is one
[41:22] of his there was many songs of degrees
[41:24] or songs of Ascension that David would
[41:26] write and there was a tradition that
[41:28] they would they would um sing these
[41:30] Psalms as they would Ascend up into
[41:32] Jerusalem and we are as a people we are
[41:35] ascending amen we're not descending
[41:36] we're not plateauing but we're going
[41:38] higher with the Lord we're going higher
[41:40] every day God is taking us higher into
[41:42] the reality of his word into to his
[41:44] presence and so David would say this is
[41:46] how good and pleasant is for for
[41:48] Brethren to dwell together in unity it
[41:50] is like the precious ointment upon the
[41:52] head that ran down upon the bed Even's
[41:54] Aaron's bed that went down to the skirts
[41:56] of the garden now you were to think
[41:58] about the significance of this where
[42:00] Aaron was the ordained man the only one
[42:04] that could could could could could shed
[42:06] uh uh sprinkle the blood of the
[42:08] atonement on The Mercy Seat for the
[42:10] people no one else could decide well
[42:12] today I'm going to go off the Blood On
[42:14] The Mercy Seat it was Aaron's position
[42:16] he was ordained to that position without
[42:19] him doing it none of the sins of the
[42:21] people were forg were
[42:23] forgiven so he had to be anointed to do
[42:25] this job he had to be dressed right you
[42:27] know there was quite a process and a you
[42:29] know a way of getting a a preparations
[42:32] made for him to fulfill his office and
[42:34] David is identifying Unity as just as
[42:38] important as the anointing that was upon
[42:40] Aaron because Aaron had to be anointed
[42:42] to be the high priest and I believe that
[42:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ must have
[42:46] Unity I mean in order to for us to fully
[42:50] manifest the office God has ordained us
[42:52] to be in amen you got to think you've
[42:54] been placed in a high and holy calling
[42:56] amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:58] and and and and this position has great
[43:01] significance you going to think of like
[43:02] Esther The Queen Esther you know morai
[43:05] knew there was a need the Jews knew
[43:07] there was a need hmon had had had had it
[43:10] written into law that all the Jews are
[43:11] going to be killed on the 13th day of
[43:14] the 12th month it was it it was written
[43:16] in law but only one person could go in
[43:19] and intercede for her people only one
[43:22] person could go in and undo what hmon
[43:24] had done and this was this wasn't Mori
[43:28] you know sure Mori said to Esther if you
[43:30] do not go in God will bring Salvation
[43:32] another way but but perhaps you've come
[43:34] into the kingdom for a Time such as this
[43:36] amen so she was ordained to go before
[43:39] the king to get Mercy for her people
[43:41] amen so this is it was her job she was
[43:44] placed in that position she wasn't
[43:46] looking for it I doubt I doubt very much
[43:48] as a young girl she said one day I'm
[43:49] going to be queen of this Empire this
[43:51] wasn't her ambition but God moved her
[43:54] into this position am mean that God's
[43:56] mercy could be extended that the that
[43:58] the threatenings and the death threat
[43:59] under her you know that her people were
[44:01] living under would be reversed amen that
[44:04] the devil schemes would come back upon
[44:05] his head and it would become a victory
[44:08] Hallelujah and that's the same thing
[44:10] with you and I friends we must have
[44:11] Unity among us we must have just more
[44:13] just ahead knowledge I believe the
[44:15] message there must be such a Oneness
[44:17] between us am me of the baptism of the
[44:19] Holy Ghost living through everyone amen
[44:21] that we are literally one body amen not
[44:24] just because we come to this church
[44:25] forget about that stuff not we have a
[44:28] Unity of spirit amen a Unity of heart a
[44:31] Unity of purpose amen you say well we've
[44:33] got to iron out all the doctrine now
[44:35] we'll all disagree on something
[44:39] absolutely if we really split hairs
[44:41] enough we will F oh he doesn't believe
[44:43] it this way a he doesn't believe it that
[44:45] way no no it's got to be Unity of spirit
[44:48] it's got to be the Holy Ghost having
[44:50] preeminence in every life I mean because
[44:52] brother Braham sees about it he speaks
[44:53] about it in Christ the mystery God
[44:55] revealed and I don't know if I can
[44:56] scroll enough to find it but he says he
[44:58] says you know you know the the new birth
[45:01] is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[45:03] that's a true Born Again experience
[45:05] where God reveals you who Jesus Christ
[45:07] is more than a prophet more than a man
[45:09] but the God man God himself manifested
[45:13] in flesh and Hallelujah that is the New
[45:15] Birth when you re when God reveals you
[45:17] who he really is hallelujah then what
[45:19] happens he puts his Spirit within you
[45:21] will you cry Abba Father you know who
[45:23] your father is you know who your parent
[45:24] is you know who your mother is cuz he's
[45:26] both father and mother of us right amen
[45:28] so so that changes who you are it
[45:31] changes how you operate and brother B
[45:33] says if we could only get maybe let's
[45:36] just find that shall
[45:37] we last slide oh man I tell you what
[45:40] praise the Lord for the there we go see
[45:42] the new birth is Christ is a revelation
[45:44] God has revealed to you this great
[45:46] mystery and that's a new birth then what
[45:48] are we going to do when you get all that
[45:50] group together where the Revelation is
[45:52] perfect in Harmony in God expressing it
[45:54] through his word by the same actions the
[45:55] same things he did making the word
[45:57] manifest so some people take that and
[45:59] say well we're going to get all the
[46:00] doctrine perfectly right and then now
[46:02] now the Revelation is perfect now God
[46:04] can move no the prophet speaking about
[46:06] those who are truly born again they've
[46:09] truly met the Lord I mean you get that
[46:11] body together something's going to move
[46:13] amen there's Harmony the devil can't
[46:15] move in there's no unbelief to to rule
[46:17] anywhere skepticism gone cynicism is
[46:19] gone unbelief is gone there's a perfect
[46:22] Unity among the people what could happen
[46:24] amen when there's a people that are one
[46:26] with our Lord Jesus Christ amen each and
[46:28] individually they've met the Lord they
[46:30] know who he is they've come to exalt his
[46:32] name praise His name worship Him above
[46:34] everything what could happen in a people
[46:36] like that I mean what could happen in a
[46:38] group like that where Faith as brother
[46:40] and says I see it all milky of the
[46:42] people real all Faith Bank over the
[46:43] people amen and people accept the
[46:45] Promises by faith and God does the
[46:47] miraculous what could happen in a group
[46:49] like that friends and I don't believe
[46:51] we're looking in the future for that to
[46:52] happen I believe it's here in our midst
[46:54] amen I mean wherever there's a true of
[46:57] Jesus Christ there's that Unity amen but
[46:59] we must strive for that Unity because we
[47:01] must realize what it can do am mean
[47:03] where God could create his because
[47:05] remember the same holy ghost in him Was
[47:08] the Same Spirit that created the world
[47:11] Amen the same one the very same one that
[47:13] said let there be sun moon and stars as
[47:15] he was condescending down through the
[47:17] Old Testament through the prophets he
[47:18] finally the fullness that godhe bodily
[47:21] became Jesus Christ right amen so the
[47:24] same one that said let there be sun moon
[47:26] and stars was now own flesh and he'd say
[47:28] to the scribes and Pharisees you know
[47:29] Abraham Rejoice to see my day and i''d
[47:32] say you're not even yet 50 years old
[47:33] what are you talking about Abraham he
[47:35] was he was ages ago he said before
[47:37] Abraham was I am he identified this is
[47:40] who I am amen so that same
[47:42] one changed his form amen went back as a
[47:46] pillar of fire again we know his
[47:47] physical body is there at the Majesty on
[47:49] high interceding for us hallelujah I'm
[47:52] glad we have a high priest on you am
[47:54] mean not just a natural human but a God
[47:56] man interceding for you and I amen we're
[47:59] going to meet him one day in the a
[48:00] that's what Believers believe but his
[48:01] spirit that was within him amen came
[48:03] down on the day of Pentecost and dwelt
[48:05] in the church now he wasn't any lesser
[48:07] God because he's in a church now amen he
[48:10] wasn't any lesser ower and ability and
[48:13] might and strength and grace and mercy
[48:15] he didn't diminish nothing when he went
[48:18] into the 120 and he hasn't demission he
[48:21] hasn't diminished nothing amen coming
[48:22] and dwelling in you and I am mean he's
[48:24] equal in power remember he's the God of
[48:26] all power he's a God of all might he's a
[48:28] God of all Grace amen he can do the
[48:30] miraculous I'm convinced God can do
[48:32] anything that's me I'm convinced he can
[48:35] do anything now I'm concerned Lord I
[48:37] want to see you do it amen I want to see
[48:39] you take your word take a sinner of
[48:41] someone who's just even a good moral
[48:42] person transform their life amen dwell

[50:48] opportunity this where where where what
[50:51] what God turn in his mind of a church

[51:02] Elders whatever you know everyone is in
[51:05] perfect Unity hallelujah amen this is
[51:09] what God's looking for and I believe
[51:10] that and the message is here to produce
[51:12] it amen God's word is here to produce it
[51:16] amen so we have this great opportunity
[51:18] now we must never ever let anything get
[51:21] between us
[51:22] amen amen well I disagree on something
[51:25] listen I as I said Wednesday I'm not
[51:27] really a fan of savory food don't cut me
[51:30] out of your
[51:32] circle okay some people don't like
[51:34] pumpkin I still love the guy anyway not
[51:36] that I'm a big fan of pkin but you know
[51:38] you know what I mean but you know
[51:40] there's always be something that we'll
[51:42] disagree on that's
[51:44] okay praise the Lord that's fine we can
[51:47] we can we can look can you look over
[51:49] those things you say that's a ridiculous
[51:51] example well in the sight of God our
[51:54] little things that we just keep and know
[51:56] and you know they're they're just as
[51:58] ridiculous because he's looking at this
[52:00] when he spoke to when he spoke to David
[52:03] and David Pinn the song down I believe
[52:05] he was looking at you and I yeah there's
[52:08] going to be people who are going to
[52:09] embody this they're going to have such a
[52:11] Unity among them that God can do
[52:13] whatever he wants in their midst
[52:15] whatever he wants however he wants
[52:16] there's such a Unity I mean where the we
[52:19] we where the spirit of God is so welcome
[52:21] yo the devil loves
[52:23] division the spirit of God brings Unity
[52:26] amen I mean what did he do Jesus came
[52:28] what did he do he began to call his
[52:30] disciples I'm going to unify with my
[52:33] attributes he called Peter James and
[52:35] John they're all attributes of God
[52:37] they're in flesh the woman at the well
[52:38] the woman with the blood or all
[52:40] different kind of ones they're all
[52:41] gathered amen and then he came down in
[52:43] the upper room what and then now now the
[52:45] Holy Ghost goes out to gather more of
[52:47] God's attributes to himself this is what
[52:49] this is what I mean by God loves loves
[52:52] Unity
[52:53] hallelujah amen so let us not be weary
[52:56] and while doing
[52:57] now Paul would describe and I was
[52:59] looking at this last night where he says
[53:01] the works of the flesh but then there's
[53:03] the fruits of the spirit he doesn't say
[53:05] the works of the spirit and the works of
[53:06] the flesh he says the works of the Flesh
[53:09] and the fruit of the spirit so now he
[53:12] lists all these we'll just read it but
[53:14] if you are LED of the spirit you're no
[53:16] longer under the
[53:17] law Pard me now the works of the flesh
[53:19] are manifest which are these adultery
[53:21] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[53:23] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[53:25] emulations Wrath Strife seditions
[53:27] heresies envyings murders drunkenness um
[53:31] riving Rings however you say it and such
[53:33] like of which I tell you before as I
[53:36] have also told you in the past that they
[53:38] which do these things shall not inherit
[53:40] the kingdom of God am mean so this works
[53:43] it means from the Thea Bible dictionary
[53:45] I like this where it says it says a
[53:47] business and employment or that which
[53:50] anyone is
[53:52] occupied I trust that none of us are
[53:54] occupied by these this list yeah this is
[53:57] not on our CV it's not on our to-do list
[54:00] it's not on our calendar reminders none
[54:02] of these things are near are near what
[54:04] we do we're not employed by those things
[54:07] it's that which one undertakes to do an
[54:09] Enterprise or an undertaking I trust
[54:12] that none of the works of the flesh are
[54:13] in our Enterprise or in our undertaking
[54:17] it's it's nothing that we undertake to
[54:19] do are you following me I I trust you
[54:21] and say amen I mean this is obvious but
[54:23] I'm sure you know because the works now
[54:27] so so it's an employment now we were all
[54:29] employed by the devil Once Upon a Time
[54:32] our first birth made us his slave now a
[54:34] slave is still employed the conditions
[54:36] are terrible but you still you still
[54:37] have a boss and they tell you what to do
[54:39] and you have to do what they say and
[54:41] slave gets beaten or whatever they you
[54:43] know if they don't listen so we were all
[54:46] employed to do the works of the flesh
[54:48] Once Upon a Time amen but but we had
[54:51] more than a boss but our our father came
[54:54] our our great king said no no you're not
[54:57] ordained to fulfill this list though you
[55:01] may have been employed by your first
[55:02] birth you're employed by this you're
[55:04] employed to do this as a slave but then
[55:07] now I'm come to break I've come to break
[55:09] this power am mean that the works of the
[55:11] Flesh of these things will not be
[55:12] manifested in your body no more amen
[55:15] that this will not be your works but you
[55:17] will enter into rest now we know the
[55:20] true rest in the Bible is the baptism of
[55:22] the Holy Ghost that's the true rest of
[55:24] God it's not keeping a day it's not
[55:26] Sabbath or anything that which was just
[55:28] a shadow of people truly entering into
[55:30] rest and so now there remaineth
[55:33] therefore a rest to the people of God
[55:35] for he that entereth into his rest he
[55:37] also hath ceased from his own Works amen
[55:41] so he ceased from his own employment you
[55:43] know his own undertaking his own
[55:44] Enterprise so it's no longer him trying
[55:46] to live the word it's no longer him
[55:48] trying to be the Christian no no no you
[55:50] cease from your own ability and you let
[55:52] God's ability come in you let his Spirit
[55:55] come in there's no are you living and
[55:57] you trying to live the message no he
[55:58] lives it in you he lives it through you
[56:01] amen as the greatest joy that I've ever
[56:03] seen in my life is to see God come and
[56:05] take his own word am mean and say quit
[56:08] you you you quit trying let me do it I'm
[56:11] the professional I know what I'm doing
[56:13] I've been doing this for thousands of
[56:14] years living in my people and
[56:16] manifesting my word so come and let me
[56:17] do it amen so now when we truly enter
[56:20] into that rest amen we cease from our
[56:22] own Works amen but then Paul would
[56:25] continue down in Galatians 5 but the
[56:27] fruit of the spirit so it's not the
[56:28] works of the spirit the fruit of the
[56:30] spirit now this is important because I'm
[56:32] just I'm I am continue with my thought
[56:35] just just hold on to your seat or
[56:37] whatever now but the fruit of the spirit
[56:39] is love joy peace longsuffering
[56:42] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[56:44] Temperance against such there is no law
[56:47] for they that are christs have crucified
[56:49] the flesh with the affections and the
[56:51] lusts if we live in the spirit let us
[56:54] also walk in the spirit let let us not
[56:56] be Dev uh desirous of vain Glory
[56:59] provoking one another but uh or envying
[57:02] one another now this word fruit we know
[57:05] it's like fruit from a tree but it's
[57:07] from which originates or comes from
[57:09] something it's an effect or a result so
[57:12] fruit comes from something like you take
[57:13] an apple tree the reason there's apples
[57:15] on that tree is there's the life of the
[57:17] apple tree is expressed in the fruit
[57:19] right even if you do grafting and things
[57:21] well you can still get the fruit that's
[57:23] been grafted on right so so it
[57:27] originates from something now so now
[57:29] you've got to look into yourself and say
[57:30] what does my life originate from does it
[57:33] originate just from my upbringing you
[57:36] know my parents were strict and they
[57:37] taught me a good moral way of being and
[57:39] this is how I am or you know I've been
[57:41] raised in the message so you know my
[57:43] conduct and all those things is based on
[57:45] my upbringing that way or is it because
[57:48] there's something within you that is far
[57:50] greater than an upbringing amen cuz
[57:52] remember we don't just grow into this
[57:53] thing no we meet him we meet the Lord
[57:55] and transforms our life amen it's good
[57:58] to be a good moral person that's fine
[58:00] but it ain't going to get you to heaven
[58:02] no it's the blood of Jesus Christ that
[58:04] will get you to heaven amen so now if we
[58:06] could look at what we have within us and
[58:09] where this fruit comes from to me it's
[58:11] very marvelous now in the Old Testament
[58:13] there was the ark of the Ark of the
[58:15] Covenant now we know that in this Ark
[58:18] there was there was certain things
[58:19] within this
[58:20] Ark this Ark represents the human soul
[58:24] right because because because the
[58:26] pattern that Moses saw that he built
[58:28] represents the human body we're not
[58:29] going to go into those things but I just
[58:31] want to Major on this here so now this
[58:33] Ark was was was overlaid and inside and
[58:36] out with gold deity so this wood it was
[58:39] covered in it was covered in Gold amen
[58:41] so so when we really meet the lord it's
[58:43] no longer our wood or our Humanity
[58:45] living no we''re been overlaid with
[58:47] deity amen with beaten gold and there's
[58:50] a mercy seat upon the top amen and then
[58:53] and then under that Mercy Seat there was
[58:54] there was three items within the ark
[58:57] there was there was the two tablets of
[58:59] stone of the law now everyone's got that
[59:02] within them but if you got to have blood
[59:04] on The Mercy Seat that makes the
[59:07] difference amen but the word as as
[59:09] because people who do things of the law
[59:12] even though they don't know the law
[59:13] they're still under that law that's why
[59:16] everyone has a
[59:17] conscience right but God would God would
[59:20] take his word and by his holy ghost
[59:22] write that law in your heart he would
[59:24] rearrange your operation system give you
[59:26] a new software upgrade amen that that
[59:29] that that how you live is based on the
[59:31] word not in here but in here amen that
[59:34] that the word in here controls your
[59:36] conscience controls your desires
[59:38] controls all that you are amen now and
[59:40] and and then also in there is a pot of
[59:43] Mana that first fell amen and this Mana
[59:46] never gets old amen sure it was the same
[59:48] Mana that fell on the outside you know
[59:50] around where the Israelites picked it up
[59:52] but that Mana got old that Mana rotted
[59:54] that Mana got stinky and all those
[59:56] things because it was kept out there but
[59:59] that same man was brought put in a
[1:00:00] golden vessel and put within the Ark of
[1:00:03] the Covenant and that and that manner
[1:00:05] never goes old amen so that word that's
[1:00:08] hidden in the heart of a Believer amen
[1:00:10] with truly knows the Lord that word
[1:00:12] never gets old it never gets moldy never
[1:00:15] gets stagnant never gets common amen but
[1:00:18] every mouthful is Rich am me every
[1:00:20] mouthful is as satisfying as the first
[1:00:22] one every mouthful amen it doesn't make
[1:00:24] you sick it doesn't make you you know oh
[1:00:26] I don't you I can't stand that food
[1:00:27] anymore no it's just wonderful am mean
[1:00:30] why cuz it's Mana that never gets old
[1:00:33] Hallelujah but also within there is
[1:00:34] Aaron's Rod now Aaron's Rod was just a
[1:00:37] star um y your your your an Armond tree
[1:00:40] just a but but it was fashion by man
[1:00:42] into a into a staff I don't know how big
[1:00:44] the original limb was that he had but
[1:00:46] you know he would have shaped it would
[1:00:47] have sanded it maybe put some binding
[1:00:50] around it to hold it a bit grip and
[1:00:52] different things but it was a man-shaped
[1:00:54] rod a man fashioned rod God but then
[1:00:56] when it came and it was dead it was
[1:00:58] dried up it was just a dead stick and
[1:01:00] that's that's what we were amen before
[1:01:03] we come into the holy of holies we're a
[1:01:04] dead stick shaped by this world shaped
[1:01:06] by our culture shaped by our upbringing
[1:01:08] we're all fashioned by these things and
[1:01:10] but but there was a life within us and
[1:01:12] it may look humanly possible this stick
[1:01:14] is dead but when it come to the presence
[1:01:16] of God I mean overnight it Blossom forth
[1:01:19] armonds again amen the potential that
[1:01:22] was within it by the Holy Ghost it came
[1:01:24] forth amen it's the same thing with you
[1:01:26] and I friends we were once shaped by the
[1:01:28] world and all these things but when we
[1:01:30] came into the presence of God that life
[1:01:32] that was buried within us that even
[1:01:34] people thought it wasn't there it came
[1:01:35] out hallelujah hallelujah amen like the
[1:01:38] woman at the well amen you look at her
[1:01:40] life she was a dead stick amen shaped by
[1:01:43] pain and hurt and regret and finding
[1:01:44] love in all the wrong places amen but
[1:01:46] when she went into the holy of holies
[1:01:48] and said we know where Messiah cometh
[1:01:50] he'll tell us these things amen what she
[1:01:52] buted to life Hallelujah she ran into
[1:01:54] the city said come see a man
[1:01:56] that told me all things over it is this
[1:01:58] not the very Messiah what happened she
[1:02:00] had been in the presence of the shakina
[1:02:02] glory amen and her life had been
[1:02:05] transformed hallelujah amen so you see
[1:02:07] now there's these three three very vital
[1:02:10] things within every Arc of testimony now
[1:02:12] we know that this actually represents
[1:02:13] you and I so I trust that there is
[1:02:16] within you the word that never gets
[1:02:18] old amen that God has written the word
[1:02:20] on the tables of your heart amen that
[1:02:22] when you go to transgress that law the
[1:02:24] Holy Ghost says I don't want you to do
[1:02:26] that because when the Holy Ghost will
[1:02:28] come he'll convict you of sin he will
[1:02:31] tell you when you're stepping wrong amen
[1:02:32] you got to surrender to him and let him
[1:02:34] lead you but he'll tell you hey no no
[1:02:36] this is a danger zone I I I don't want
[1:02:38] to do this thing amen so there's that
[1:02:41] there's a word that never gets old and
[1:02:43] there's life like Aaron's Rod there was
[1:02:46] life amen so I trust now this is what
[1:02:48] you're walking around with now you got
[1:02:50] to think about it how powerful it is to
[1:02:52] access what's within this and of course
[1:02:54] on every believer the The Mercy Seat is
[1:02:56] sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] am mean so it's no longer a judgment
[1:03:00] seat cuz when there was no blood there
[1:03:01] was judgment but when the blood was
[1:03:03] there was a seat of Mercy amen so now
[1:03:05] Mercy has been given so Mercy can be
[1:03:09] extended amen if you know what it's like
[1:03:11] to be forgiven you can forgive if you
[1:03:13] know what it's like to receive the mercy
[1:03:15] of God you didn't deserve it you didn't
[1:03:16] earn it but he gave it to you freely
[1:03:18] then you can give Mercy to others no
[1:03:20] matter what they've done to you you can
[1:03:22] extend Mercy well how do you extend that
[1:03:23] Mercy you can lift them before God and
[1:03:25] prayer you can you can be you can sure
[1:03:28] you can have a lot of pain and hurt from
[1:03:30] what they've done to you but you can
[1:03:31] have a genuine concern for their soul
[1:03:33] you can feel sorry for them you can
[1:03:36] actually you want to see them on the
[1:03:37] other side amen glory Lord amen we can
[1:03:41] live in such a way that pain actually
[1:03:43] just turns into prayer amen that pain
[1:03:45] and hurt doesn't turn into doesn't build
[1:03:47] bitterness but no it just it it causes
[1:03:49] us to
[1:03:51] intercede amen so these things are all
[1:03:53] within the believer now if you look look
[1:03:55] at Hezekiah I was thinking about
[1:03:57] Hezekiah and and maybe I should have
[1:03:58] just preached on him for a bit but you
[1:04:00] know you look at Hezekiah there he was
[1:04:03] in Jerusalem this Ark was in the temple
[1:04:07] but they needed to be unified in order
[1:04:09] to access God's power because the
[1:04:12] Assyrians had gathered around they had
[1:04:14] they had swallowed up pretty much the
[1:04:15] whole country and they had they had men
[1:04:18] that had now their army had besed
[1:04:20] Jerusalem and they begin to speak to to
[1:04:23] Israel in their own language they they
[1:04:25] begin to use the terminology of a
[1:04:27] Believer against the Believers they
[1:04:30] begin to use the quotes misinterpret it
[1:04:33] they use the scripture misinterpret it
[1:04:35] to try and pull down the confidence that
[1:04:40] that the people had in their God and in
[1:04:42] their King right but then they begin to
[1:04:45] unify that God was still a
[1:04:48] deliverer Unity came in because you
[1:04:50] would think you have you have heard the
[1:04:54] enemy has swallowed up everything else
[1:04:56] so what they've said is true look at all
[1:04:59] the places we've been their gods didn't
[1:05:01] help them your God is the same as theirs
[1:05:03] you know Hezekiah is leading you wrong
[1:05:05] and you're going to be destroyed and
[1:05:06] when we take the city we're going to
[1:05:07] butcher you all all these things that
[1:05:09] would have caused a lot of different
[1:05:10] thoughts going on yeah what's going to
[1:05:13] happen to my family what's going to
[1:05:14] happen to my children what's going to
[1:05:16] happen to my daughters what's going to
[1:05:17] happen to me all those thoughts and
[1:05:19] maybe thoughts of maybe we could escape
[1:05:21] this way and you know but but they they
[1:05:24] because their King was a Godly King and
[1:05:27] he and he gathered the people say look
[1:05:29] our God is a deliverer he delivered in
[1:05:32] the days of Moses he delivered Goliath
[1:05:35] into into David's hands he delivered
[1:05:37] many enemies look at look at we have
[1:05:39] testimony amen of his power of
[1:05:42] Deliverance and he can do the same thing
[1:05:44] today and he went and so what they do
[1:05:46] they unified on that one attribute of
[1:05:49] God that he's a
[1:05:50] deliverer Hallelujah they unified on
[1:05:52] that one one attribute of God as a
[1:05:54] people they said basically Lord help us
[1:05:56] we're in big trouble we can't fight we
[1:05:58] can't win this battle look what they've
[1:06:00] done and God says no no no I've heard
[1:06:03] I've heard their accusations they're
[1:06:05] actually talking against me now I'm
[1:06:08] because because Hezekiah stood for God
[1:06:12] God stood for Hezekiah am mean because
[1:06:15] Hezekiah believed God's promises then
[1:06:18] God became concerned about Hezekiah and
[1:06:21] the people of Israel because Hezekiah
[1:06:23] and the people had respect unto God
[1:06:26] praise the Lord so this Ark that was
[1:06:28] there they accessed God dwelling between
[1:06:31] the cherubims and God anointed one of
[1:06:33] their prophets or their priests and he
[1:06:36] said tomorrow they're all going to be
[1:06:37] dead if I've got the story right and
[1:06:40] what that night the angel Lord came out
[1:06:42] just slew all the
[1:06:43] Assyrians amen God fought for them
[1:06:46] because they unified on one
[1:06:49] promise friends we got many promises to
[1:06:51] unify on Amen we got many promises to
[1:06:54] unify on and the way to unify on it is
[1:06:57] to have a full confidence God can do it
[1:07:00] God can do it how's he going to do it I
[1:07:01] don't know but God can do it I mean
[1:07:03] maybe they thought when they came before
[1:07:04] the temple there and begin to pray how's
[1:07:07] how's God ever going to deliver us he
[1:07:08] said and and and maybe they said well
[1:07:10] maybe they had lots of ideas well maybe
[1:07:12] the Egyptians will come up or maybe this
[1:07:14] one will come up or maybe this will
[1:07:15] happen but then they no doubt they would
[1:07:17] have come to the conclusion he's a
[1:07:19] deliverer let him do the delivering let
[1:07:21] however he wants to do it he's going to
[1:07:23] do it but let's unify together let's
[1:07:25] have a Unity among the people that God
[1:07:27] can come down and bring a mighty
[1:07:30] Deliverance prise the Lord hallelujah
[1:07:32] and we know the rest of the story it's
[1:07:34] exactly what happened the angel Lord
[1:07:35] came down killed killed the enemies they
[1:07:37] had a mighty Victory why because they
[1:07:40] unified around around one promise Amen
[1:07:43] to let us and you think about that's
[1:07:45] just Israel under the blood of bulls and
[1:07:46] goats now amen it's not a people who had
[1:07:49] join ear with Christ join ears with God
[1:07:51] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen so
[1:07:53] now how much more people that are under
[1:07:55] under the blood of Jesus Christ they're
[1:07:56] not under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:07:58] they're not under the law anymore but
[1:07:59] they've been lifted Above the Law
[1:08:01] they've been lifted above am mean their
[1:08:03] own humanity and all those things and
[1:08:05] tradition but we've been restored back
[1:08:07] to the true word of God that we truly
[1:08:09] have received the atonement yeah now I
[1:08:12] was listening to someone the other day
[1:08:13] and they was speaking about that word
[1:08:15] atonement now that word atonement was
[1:08:17] actually uh invented by William Tindale
[1:08:20] William Tindale gave us so so he was
[1:08:22] really the first one well others did at
[1:08:25] the Bible but but but really he was the
[1:08:27] first one to to to to to fully translate
[1:08:30] it but then also distribute it because
[1:08:32] he is a contemporary of Martin Luther
[1:08:34] said the printing press and all these
[1:08:35] things and so he translated the Bible
[1:08:37] and he and and there was a lot of things
[1:08:39] that he did not have an English word for
[1:08:41] one was the atonement so he actually
[1:08:44] made that word up to try and represent
[1:08:46] what the Hebrew and the Greek and the
[1:08:48] Latin meant there and that and that word
[1:08:50] atonement is actually we know it's like
[1:08:52] three words at onement so so he's so
[1:08:55] he's actually God inspired him to say
[1:08:59] this is what the this is what the blood
[1:09:01] does it makes you one with God that's
[1:09:03] what if you have received the atonement
[1:09:06] you are at one with God how powerful is
[1:09:09] that you think about a man who is
[1:09:10] standing there in a day where the
[1:09:11] Catholic church was basically Supreme
[1:09:14] and that church was preaching you got to
[1:09:15] come through the church to meet God and
[1:09:18] yet you've still got to go to pergatory
[1:09:19] you got to do Penance you got to do all
[1:09:21] these things to try and please God but
[1:09:23] then God inspired a man am mean to say
[1:09:25] no this is what the blood does it makes
[1:09:27] you at one with God that you have
[1:09:29] received the atonement am mean that
[1:09:31] you're no longer a second class citizen
[1:09:33] no longer begging your way into heaven
[1:09:35] but the Lord Jesus himself by his blood
[1:09:37] has made you at one with him that once
[1:09:39] you're dead and trespass and sins but if
[1:09:41] you received the atonement friends am
[1:09:43] mean You' elevated above those things
[1:09:45] now you're alive in Christ and you're
[1:09:47] one with God hallelujah what an
[1:09:50] incredible thing to actually God Inspire
[1:09:52] someone to invent a word that is
[1:09:53] immensely powerful word amen where you
[1:09:56] look at where the you know where where
[1:09:58] where he would speak about the atonement
[1:10:00] a lot of course in the Old Testament of
[1:10:01] the high priest going in before you know
[1:10:04] taking the blood and into the mercy seat
[1:10:05] and spr you know sprinkling it and so on
[1:10:08] and that was the day of atonement so
[1:10:10] even yeah God was trying to get the
[1:10:12] people to see listen this blood makes
[1:10:14] you one with me how powerful is that you
[1:10:17] know but and and you think about it if
[1:10:19] you really recognize that it would
[1:10:21] change you it would change your thinking
[1:10:24] about God it would change your you're
[1:10:25] thinking about yourself would change
[1:10:27] you're thinking about your past it would
[1:10:29] change everything because you realize
[1:10:31] he's a holy God he's high and lofty in
[1:10:33] the heavens amen even angels look dirty
[1:10:35] in his sight but yet he's provided a way
[1:10:38] that I can become one with him yet he
[1:10:40] has made a way that though I may be in
[1:10:42] this body I may be all this kind of
[1:10:44] thing but God by his blood amen would
[1:10:46] would lift me up I mean that I'm more
[1:10:48] than a sinner amen but I've been
[1:10:50] redeemed I become one with him by his
[1:10:52] atonement amen the power of His
[1:10:54] atonement now under the blood of bulls
[1:10:56] and goats people who realize they're at
[1:10:58] one with God did Mighty things I mean
[1:11:00] when David saw Goliath he says who is
[1:11:03] this uncircumcised Philistine that
[1:11:05] defies the armies of the Living God
[1:11:07] basically he's saying look we are
[1:11:09] circumcised Hebrews we have been God has
[1:11:12] made an atonement for us that we're at
[1:11:15] one with him amen but this man who's
[1:11:17] boasting and look so big and so fearsome
[1:11:20] has has no Covenant with god he has no
[1:11:22] atonement amen he is God has done
[1:11:25] nothing for this guy I mean but he's
[1:11:27] done everything for us so therefore he
[1:11:29] could stand there and say no I'm going
[1:11:31] to take his head off I mean because I
[1:11:32] have a covenant with God I mean so so
[1:11:35] David's thinking was totally different
[1:11:37] to the rest of Israel CU he realized the
[1:11:40] power of that atonement hallelujah
[1:11:41] hallelujah amen now friends I trust it's
[1:11:43] the same thing with you and I this
[1:11:45] morning amen we realize the power of the
[1:11:47] atonement amen we're not just church
[1:11:49] join us amen putting our name on a book
[1:11:51] just trying to have some kind of
[1:11:52] religion no God has elevated us to be
[1:11:56] joiners with him amen that his atonement
[1:11:58] has covered us over drawn us back into
[1:12:00] his presence made us sinless in his
[1:12:02] sight amen that we are the children of
[1:12:05] God Amen do you realize these things I
[1:12:07] trust I I trust it means a lot to you I
[1:12:09] have received the atonement Hallelujah
[1:12:12] I'm on my way to heaven shouting Victory
[1:12:14] Amen in spite of all the trouble
[1:12:16] heartache sorrow pain whatever more no I
[1:12:18] have receive the atonement amen so
[1:12:21] therefore I have confidence with God I
[1:12:23] can walk before him I can lay myti at
[1:12:25] his feet and he hears my prayers he's
[1:12:27] concerned about my welfare he's worried
[1:12:29] about what I'm going through and he is
[1:12:31] interested in my situation he's not
[1:12:33] unmindful because you got think about
[1:12:34] now an at onement means Two Become One
[1:12:38] like a true marriage is a you'd say an
[1:12:40] atonement two become one right so now in
[1:12:43] Israel Israel was always second class
[1:12:46] citizen to God they always because the
[1:12:48] blood of bulls and goats though they had
[1:12:50] an atonement it wasn't an atonement in
[1:12:53] reality because it could not never elev
[1:12:55] at the people to be joint ears with God
[1:12:58] right and this was shown in the Old
[1:13:00] Testament where where where where the
[1:13:02] the you know the women there in in
[1:13:04] Israel were second class citizens to the
[1:13:06] men they could not come in like because
[1:13:09] there was different you know how there
[1:13:12] was different places people could have
[1:13:13] um come to that that was the closest
[1:13:16] they could approach the holy of holies
[1:13:18] first it was the court of the Gentiles
[1:13:19] we could come but we couldn't come as
[1:13:21] close as the Hebrew woman then there was
[1:13:22] the court of the woman a bit closer than
[1:13:24] the Gentiles but but not as close as the
[1:13:26] men and then after that was the priests
[1:13:29] and then the high priest go to the holy
[1:13:30] of hly so so the woman could not come as
[1:13:32] close as the men right but then now
[1:13:35] Peter is is is writing to the New
[1:13:38] Testament Church saying that husband and
[1:13:40] wife are join ears
[1:13:42] together so now coming under the blood
[1:13:45] of Jesus Christ we're all the same in
[1:13:47] Christ there's no second class citizens
[1:13:50] in the kingdom and there's not a
[1:13:52] Ministry than the people or anything
[1:13:53] like that or men and women no we're all
[1:13:55] on the same level amen and if you're a
[1:13:58] man and if you're still under the law
[1:14:00] your wife is a second class citizen
[1:14:02] spiritually to you that's how you treat
[1:14:05] her but if you're under grace you want
[1:14:06] to lift her up to be joiners with you
[1:14:09] that's that's that's your whole desire
[1:14:10] would be that your family your wife
[1:14:11] would become joiners with you you're not
[1:14:14] they're not down there and they don't
[1:14:15] know nothing they don't know God no
[1:14:17] they're
[1:14:18] spiritual they know the Lord we're in
[1:14:21] this together we're on equal footing
[1:14:23] amen uh well some people are not
[1:14:26] convinced about that well get into
[1:14:28] Christ then you'll be
[1:14:30] convinced amen so
[1:14:34] now we have this atonement which was
[1:14:37] just it was an it was so it was an at
[1:14:39] onean as I said so now by the blood of
[1:14:41] Jesus Christ We Are One amen glory we
[1:14:45] are we have been atoned am mean God has
[1:14:48] atoned us he's brought us back together
[1:14:51] amen and I love it because if you look
[1:14:53] at the you know even even this word
[1:14:55] atonement was you know it it has a
[1:14:58] meaning of of um you know when when um
[1:15:01] it's the same kind of word that that is
[1:15:04] described when Moses speaks about when
[1:15:06] Noah builds the ark it says and he
[1:15:08] pitched the ark within and without with
[1:15:10] um you know with pitch right and that
[1:15:13] word is actually means atonement so it's
[1:15:16] actually a covering and what did it do
[1:15:18] it covered the whole Ark that atonement
[1:15:20] so when you looked at the ark I don't
[1:15:22] know what um basically you just see one
[1:15:25] whole thing you don't see separated
[1:15:27] boards anymore though they're nailed
[1:15:29] together and fixed in place you don't
[1:15:31] see separated individual pieces of wood
[1:15:33] put together you see one whole thing cuz
[1:15:35] it's been atoned for there's a Oneness
[1:15:38] in the ark you following me there's no
[1:15:40] gaps and holes and plugs where your
[1:15:42] water can come through no no it's all
[1:15:44] atoned for amen and and and and that's
[1:15:47] what exactly what the Lord has done for
[1:15:49] you and I amen that that Ark was atoned
[1:15:52] for amen that the atonement stood
[1:15:55] between the ark and the Judgment cuz the
[1:15:57] go for word it was made out of was was
[1:15:59] porous it would just it's like a sponge
[1:16:02] you don't build boats out of that kind
[1:16:04] of wood unless it's been atoned for you
[1:16:07] see and it's the same thing with our
[1:16:09] Humanity we are like a sponge we'll
[1:16:11] absorb any Spirit we'll absorb anything
[1:16:13] but if there's the atonement here amen
[1:16:16] that thing can trouble you in your mind
[1:16:18] can try and come into your spirit but
[1:16:19] there's an atonement I mean it may it
[1:16:21] may buffer against you but it can't it
[1:16:23] can't rule you it can't take you over
[1:16:25] you can you can push back against that
[1:16:27] thing amen why cuz you've been Aon
[1:16:28] you've been pitched within and without
[1:16:30] amen by the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:16:33] so so what you've been atoned for that
[1:16:35] you can stand the Judgment than Glory
[1:16:38] Hallelujah so as this world is falling
[1:16:40] apart we ain't falling apart no we're
[1:16:42] standing on the solid rock of Revelation
[1:16:45] hallelujah thank you Lord praise the
[1:16:47] Lord amen and you know what's beautiful
[1:16:50] is that when the Lord gives you the Holy
[1:16:52] Ghost it's a confirmation that confirms
[1:16:55] the atonement to
[1:16:57] you amen so it's no longer a hope is or
[1:17:00] I believe it in faith no that Faith
[1:17:01] becomes reality why because you're
[1:17:04] pitched within and without you've been
[1:17:05] atoned for the Holy Ghost when the Lord
[1:17:08] returns back in that form in you it's a
[1:17:10] confirmation you have the atonement so
[1:17:13] what have we got to worry about what
[1:17:15] have we got to fear nothing at all n
[1:17:19] there is nothing there is nothing that
[1:17:20] we need to worry about doesn't matter
[1:17:22] what enemy comes against us we have the
[1:17:24] atonement HJ Hallelujah and we've got to
[1:17:26] realize friends that there are no weak
[1:17:29] Parts with God I'm talking about the
[1:17:31] body of Christ now there's no stronger
[1:17:34] parts and weaker Parts no every part
[1:17:36] because remember the the same Holy Ghost
[1:17:39] comes and dwells in everyone the same
[1:17:41] quality maybe like brotherr would say
[1:17:43] you know the fullness of God here bodily
[1:17:45] dwelt in our lord Jesus says it's like
[1:17:46] you know you take the Pacific Ocean
[1:17:48] that's the fullness of God here bodily
[1:17:50] and maybe the Lord you know it's like
[1:17:51] but us he puts it in by measure right so
[1:17:54] it's like you take a teaspoon of that
[1:17:56] water and that's the measure the ocean
[1:17:58] without measure but the same chemicals
[1:18:01] the same quality of water is the same in
[1:18:03] the spoon as it is in the ocean and you
[1:18:05] think about God God is all powerful
[1:18:08] Almighty he said let there be sun moon
[1:18:10] and stars and there are amen nothing can
[1:18:12] stop him nothing can stop not even
[1:18:15] unbelief will stop him he'll move right
[1:18:16] on with his program amen he is
[1:18:18] Unstoppable he's unmovable amen he's all
[1:18:21] powerful Hallelujah he is all he is the
[1:18:23] almighty God so now he is in
[1:18:26] you what can God do in you see see God
[1:18:30] wants to take a people and he wants to
[1:18:32] take the same one that the devil used as
[1:18:35] a slave and show the power of the blood
[1:18:37] to show the power of redemption in those
[1:18:39] people with that mouth once spoke
[1:18:41] unbelief and Malice and strife and
[1:18:43] hatred it now speaks the word it speaks
[1:18:46] peace and love and joy and amen the
[1:18:48] anointing amen where once it tore people
[1:18:51] down then it builds people up once it
[1:18:53] invited Devils Now cast Devils amen
[1:18:55] that's what God wants to use us for amen
[1:18:58] you see so God don't have no little weak
[1:19:01] parts so you can say let the weak say I
[1:19:03] am strong if you say I'm not even much
[1:19:05] of a Christian but you're a
[1:19:07] Christian what's the devil trying to do
[1:19:09] push you down a hole somewhere saying
[1:19:11] you not going to amount to nothing no
[1:19:13] but you got giant killing faith I mean
[1:19:15] you got overcoming power in your life
[1:19:17] doesn't matter how you feel about
[1:19:18] yourself when God looks at you he says I
[1:19:20] see strength I see virtue I see love I
[1:19:23] see peace I see over coming power I see
[1:19:25] my word in flesh amen so don't say
[1:19:28] you're weak just say no I'm strong in
[1:19:31] the Lord yes I may have a lot of things
[1:19:33] about myself but no he is strong and
[1:19:35] he's the Overcomer and he's Within Me am
[1:19:38] mean God don't have no little weak parts
[1:19:39] and strong Parts he's alog together God
[1:19:42] and if you had enough God in youtil he
[1:19:44] is barely a shadow that's enough power
[1:19:45] to make a new Earth amen I don't believe
[1:19:49] he's talking things up that's true
[1:19:51] that's right yes so I'm not feeling much
[1:19:53] in faith today if you got a shadow of
[1:19:55] Faith boom that's enough power to make a
[1:19:58] new moon a new system it's God and it's
[1:20:00] strong and right now every believer in
[1:20:02] here has has life eternal which is God's
[1:20:04] spirit in you enough power that will
[1:20:06] raise up the dead it will heal the sick
[1:20:08] it will set the orbits and conditions
[1:20:10] amen we have power so he's not just to
[1:20:13] me he's not just talking about orbits
[1:20:14] and conditions of the solar system no
[1:20:16] you got power within you to bring
[1:20:18] Harmony to your home amen if you let God
[1:20:20] do it amen you can bring restitution
[1:20:23] restoration healing amen salvation where
[1:20:25] someone's gone way out of orbit amen
[1:20:27] they can come back into their orbit with
[1:20:29] god with the word amen but it's you it's
[1:20:32] controlled by a law that Spirit that's
[1:20:34] in you the Lord so that's a law so it's
[1:20:37] why it's whatever the Lord leads you to
[1:20:39] believe for that's yours not what just
[1:20:43] humanly you think for what he leads you
[1:20:45] to believe for and that's why it's so
[1:20:47] important God you can do anything I'm
[1:20:49] not going to put a limitation on you I'm
[1:20:51] not going to hind you in any way I
[1:20:53] believe you can do it Hallelujah I
[1:20:55] believe he can do it amen so so
[1:20:57] therefore now if you believe that way
[1:20:58] God is going to come on your scene I
[1:21:00] believe and do what you think is
[1:21:02] impossible like brother Bram would you
[1:21:04] know quote the scripture Mark 11 I think
[1:21:06] 24:23 if you say to this mountain be th
[1:21:09] removed and you know you know believe
[1:21:12] it'll happen and God told him about that
[1:21:15] scripture and God challenged him to
[1:21:17] believe it God and you know he's hunting
[1:21:20] squirrels he's looking at trees there's
[1:21:22] no squirrels there even the trees he's
[1:21:24] looking at squirrels don't naturally go
[1:21:25] on those trees they avoid them and God
[1:21:27] asked them what are you looking for well
[1:21:30] I'm here hunting squirrels how many do
[1:21:31] you want he's thinking am I what's going
[1:21:35] on here well you say you want how many
[1:21:37] do you want and he said I know five
[1:21:38] whatever it was and you know one just
[1:21:40] appeared he shot it and then he said
[1:21:43] well and then he goes to pick it up and
[1:21:44] that was nice and but God said I thought
[1:21:46] you wanted five or three whatever it was
[1:21:48] you've only got one or two he says well
[1:21:50] let the scroll go here here up on this
[1:21:51] Branch I'll shoot it here and the scroll
[1:21:53] just like that what did God do he
[1:21:55] interpreted that verse to the
[1:21:59] prophet amen God interpreted it by
[1:22:01] bringing it to pass so God wanted to
[1:22:03] prove the scripture in his life now we
[1:22:06] are not looking for
[1:22:09] squirrels hey if God led me to do that
[1:22:12] you know that's neat but but to me I've
[1:22:14] got more concerns than hunting squirrels
[1:22:15] right now amen we have sickness we're
[1:22:19] protocols we got troubles we got people
[1:22:21] who need to know the Lord there's a
[1:22:23] greater bride's Revival to experience
[1:22:25] amen more people to come in if we remain
[1:22:27] humble remember he'll bring people in
[1:22:29] they'll find rest the baptism of the
[1:22:31] Holy Ghost amen so there's many things
[1:22:33] amen that that that I have greater need
[1:22:35] of than than a squirrel but I believe
[1:22:38] God can give us the same faith I mean
[1:22:41] because it's governed by a law but I but
[1:22:43] I believe the same faith that was in the
[1:22:45] prophet is is within you and I because
[1:22:47] remember the purpose of the message was
[1:22:49] not brother brandham the purpose of the
[1:22:52] message is a bride one with the Lord
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ manifesting his word to the
[1:22:57] earth that is the purpose of the message
[1:22:59] it's not just to talk about what
[1:23:00] happened in the prophet's life all that
[1:23:02] was done that you would know and see the
[1:23:04] power of the blood in a redeemed son of
[1:23:06] man Son of God rather you know amen one
[1:23:09] of us Redeemed by the blood amen so now
[1:23:12] that's why we should say Lord you can do
[1:23:14] anything I'm not here to hinder you Lord
[1:23:16] I'm not going to put you in a box but
[1:23:18] Lord May the law of the spirit control
[1:23:21] me to speak whatever you want done amen
[1:23:26] amen see that same spirit that you've
[1:23:28] got in you will raise yourself up at the
[1:23:29] last day of the
[1:23:31] Resurrection the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:33] Ghost
[1:23:34] now I need to come back to something
[1:23:36] here
[1:23:37] because it's amazing where it speaks
[1:23:40] here about do not do if we just going
[1:23:42] back up here Galatians says let us not
[1:23:45] be desirous of vain Glory provoking one
[1:23:49] provoking one another envying one
[1:23:51] another and that word provoking means to
[1:23:53] irritate
[1:23:57] it's vain glory to irritate a Believer
[1:24:01] it is vain glory to try and be some kind
[1:24:03] of superior thing above someone else
[1:24:06] it's vain glory to you know there's a
[1:24:09] lot of attempted murder in a
[1:24:11] church brother Braham says murdering
[1:24:14] someone is not just shooting them it's
[1:24:16] killing their influence and there's a
[1:24:18] lot of attempted murderers that come in
[1:24:20] among
[1:24:21] believers they try and kill other
[1:24:23] people's influence is it it's vain Glory
[1:24:26] they do it to try and make themselves
[1:24:27] look better than someone else they
[1:24:30] irritate by their actions by their deeds
[1:24:32] by their words why because they want to
[1:24:34] be appear to be better than someone
[1:24:37] else we're not called for this stuff Our
[1:24:41] Lives should not irritate one another we
[1:24:43] may cause misunderstandings we're human
[1:24:45] we understand those things but we
[1:24:46] shouldn't purposely irritate one another
[1:24:48] amen we should live above these things
[1:24:50] we're not living in a playground where
[1:24:52] I'm the king of the castle you're the
[1:24:54] dir rasal kind of game or let's play run
[1:24:56] away from that guy we used to play that
[1:24:58] at primary
[1:25:00] school we were kids we needed a good box
[1:25:03] line to come on a wake up and hey he's a
[1:25:05] he's a person too he's in the school too
[1:25:07] just like you that's wrong don't treat
[1:25:10] him that way I think I've grown up past
[1:25:12] that hopefully you know but that kind of
[1:25:15] thing is to Pro to provoke or to
[1:25:16] irritate we should not irritate one
[1:25:19] another by our actions we our action
[1:25:21] should bring Harmony should bring peace
[1:25:24] you want to think about how do I treat
[1:25:26] other people well I'm annoyed at
[1:25:28] something well don't don't bring that
[1:25:32] annoyance among other
[1:25:33] people I had a bad Drive well I didn't
[1:25:36] but the argument sake people get road
[1:25:38] rage then they spend the rest of the day
[1:25:41] pouring that road road rage out on other
[1:25:43] people was I driving there was I in
[1:25:46] front of you was I on the road at the
[1:25:48] same time why are you treating me like
[1:25:49] that person you know and really we
[1:25:51] should be big enough to say well if
[1:25:53] you're stuck in traffic God wants you
[1:25:54] stuck in traffic praise God lord I can
[1:25:57] talk to you a bit longer in the car we
[1:25:59] can have a conversation in the car
[1:26:00] longer I can be on the phone you know
[1:26:02] there's a reason why you're stuck in
[1:26:03] traffic don't be caught up in you it's
[1:26:05] like people get this thing in their mind
[1:26:06] if they've got to deal with the IID or
[1:26:08] deal with you know something that's oh
[1:26:10] it's going to be tense it's going to be
[1:26:12] stressful it's not always going to be
[1:26:14] that way why why come with that
[1:26:17] preconceived
[1:26:19] emotion oh well there's nothing to fight
[1:26:21] against therefore you know I've got to C
[1:26:23] some IR
[1:26:24] here we're going to have some trial in
[1:26:26] no we don't have to have a trial turn
[1:26:28] your gun against the devil and blast his
[1:26:30] head off for once he's a big enough
[1:26:32] Target just just turn your prayers well
[1:26:34] how do I do that love the
[1:26:36] Brethren be good to one another amen
[1:26:39] pray for one another that's how you blow
[1:26:42] the devil's head off right instead of
[1:26:44] irritating causing
[1:26:46] irritation no let's just let's just move
[1:26:49] on you know I think I think we should
[1:26:52] have you know church or or when we get
[1:26:54] together should almost there shouldn't
[1:26:56] be any
[1:26:57] drama there should be a drama-free
[1:27:01] group it shouldn't be well last week
[1:27:04] Sono did this and this and this and this
[1:27:05] and this and this no that's irritations
[1:27:07] but we should live beyond those things
[1:27:10] what are we what are we striving to
[1:27:12] achieve we're striving to achieve that
[1:27:14] God would come and live in us as a
[1:27:17] people amen that the power of the spoken
[1:27:19] word can be fully manifested that
[1:27:21] whatever God wants to do he can do it am
[1:27:24] amen amen amen amen so let's get rid of
[1:27:28] let's get rid of irritations but you see
[1:27:29] the thing is now this is uh somewhere in
[1:27:33] Southland anyway that road has two
[1:27:36] ditches on one ditch on either side
[1:27:39] right now the way of Holiness is a
[1:27:42] highway it's oneway Street we're called
[1:27:44] to walk up the middle of it we're not
[1:27:47] called to go near one side or the other
[1:27:49] because one ditch is legalistic one
[1:27:51] ditch is liberal both are ditches
[1:27:55] we're not called to walk in the gutter
[1:27:57] uh we're called to walk down the middle
[1:27:59] amen amen but what keeps you in the what
[1:28:02] what what puts you in a ditch is a lack
[1:28:03] of genuine love for God you know and and
[1:28:06] how do you know you love God you love
[1:28:08] the
[1:28:09] Brethren if you have a genuine love
[1:28:11] it'll keep you in the middle it's not
[1:28:13] being a bit more legal keeps you in the
[1:28:14] middle no it'll put you in a ditch
[1:28:17] there's two ditches no if you genuinely
[1:28:20] love the Lord he will keep you in the
[1:28:21] middle of the road
[1:28:24] amen because both legalism and
[1:28:26] liberalism are a perversion of a genuine
[1:28:28] walk with God and I don't believe I'm
[1:28:30] looking at a perversion this morning
[1:28:33] okay so don't live a perverted Christian
[1:28:35] life being legal or liberal you'll end
[1:28:37] up in a ditch and that ditch will become
[1:28:39] a trench that trench will become a
[1:28:41] bunker and you'll stay there keep
[1:28:43] walking up the
[1:28:44] highway would you if you're driving in
[1:28:46] this scener do you really want to sit in
[1:28:48] this ditch I'd rather man we're going up
[1:28:51] to those mountains we're going on an
[1:28:53] adventure what's around the corner I
[1:28:54] don't know but it's
[1:28:56] neat isn't it the same way with God I'm
[1:28:58] just going to sit here this is all like
[1:29:00] no well 10 years ago this happened but
[1:29:02] I'm still here no keep walking this
[1:29:04] person said this and I'm still living
[1:29:06] under it no I'm living under the
[1:29:08] atonement I'm living under the power of
[1:29:10] the blood I'm walking up the highway
[1:29:12] things will try and push you I guess
[1:29:14] we've all experienced it you're driving
[1:29:15] along and a big crosswind comes along do
[1:29:17] you go I'm in the ditch no you keep you
[1:29:20] you you you let the car correct right
[1:29:22] you you subconscious correct the car to
[1:29:25] stay on the lane yeah I hope you do
[1:29:27] anyway otherwise let's go have some
[1:29:28] driving lessons but you know but it
[1:29:30] should be the same spiritually a
[1:29:32] crosswind will come the devil tries to
[1:29:33] push you into a ditch this person said
[1:29:36] this and you don't need to do this and
[1:29:37] that person's enforcing this and this
[1:29:39] it's a crosswind comes along your way no
[1:29:41] say Lord correct me that I'm in the
[1:29:43] middle well how do you know that you're
[1:29:45] in the middle well I'll tell you if
[1:29:47] you're in a ditch or if you're going
[1:29:48] down into one of those ditches you
[1:29:50] despise the other side if you're legal
[1:29:52] you despise the liberal and if you're
[1:29:54] liberal you detest the
[1:29:56] legal if you love you're calling from
[1:29:59] both sides come let's go up the mountain
[1:30:01] amen let's go on a road trip this is
[1:30:03] awesome don't sit
[1:30:07] here amen so let's keep walking let's
[1:30:09] not let's not despise anyone you say
[1:30:12] they've been in a ditch a long time
[1:30:14] we've got big
[1:30:15] cranes we can move some Earth can can't
[1:30:17] we can't we dig out you see someone
[1:30:19] stuck who's ever you know seen someone
[1:30:22] crash in the you you see a you see car
[1:30:24] in a ditch the first thing you do I
[1:30:26] trust is slow down see if anyone's there
[1:30:30] if you see police tape whatever you keep
[1:30:32] driving right but but you're concerned
[1:30:33] man someone's in the ditch here this is
[1:30:36] bad and if someone was you'd stop You'
[1:30:38] call one1 you'd see how they are you do
[1:30:40] all those things right what about
[1:30:42] spiritually is it spiritually you just
[1:30:44] kind of go B CL and keep driving oh you
[1:30:47] deserve to be in there you should have
[1:30:49] been paying attention no you pull over
[1:30:52] hey brother how you doing sister how
[1:30:54] doing you know the Lord's
[1:30:56] awesome let's Happ you out here don't
[1:30:58] you love the Lord isn't he so good what
[1:31:00] do you do you pour in oil and wine into
[1:31:03] their wounds like the great Samaritan I
[1:31:05] mean you know you know the Good
[1:31:06] Samaritan brother BR tells that I mean
[1:31:08] the Lord Jesus sorry tells that Parable
[1:31:10] and brother BR interprets it saying that
[1:31:12] that man was going from Jerusalem down
[1:31:13] to Jericho he was backsliding and and
[1:31:16] during his backsliding amen the devil's
[1:31:19] got a hold of him and beat him up and
[1:31:20] robbed him for everything he had now
[1:31:22] he's laying there wounded what is he
[1:31:23] basic he's in the ditch and people come
[1:31:26] along who should have helped him but
[1:31:29] they didn't help him and the guy who
[1:31:31] shouldn't have helped him because of the
[1:31:32] segregation Samaritan and Jew helped him
[1:31:35] but the reason he helped him is because
[1:31:37] he had the oil and the wine and the
[1:31:39] bandages to bind him up and he had the
[1:31:41] donkey to carry him to the
[1:31:44] Inn do we really have what we say we
[1:31:47] have or do we keep walking like the
[1:31:49] Pharisee who had none of those things oh
[1:31:52] but I'm a Believer do you have oil and
[1:31:54] the wine what is that that's the oil is
[1:31:56] the anointing and the wine is the
[1:31:58] stimulation of Revelation amen and mean
[1:32:01] you start pouring that into someone
[1:32:02] isn't the Lord good Hallelujah I I saw
[1:32:06] this quote the other I read this
[1:32:07] scripture I heard this song Come and joy
[1:32:09] and what are you doing you're actually
[1:32:10] pouring those things into their wounds
[1:32:13] amen you know someone's maybe been
[1:32:15] wounded by disappointment or someone's
[1:32:18] someone's misuse and whatever more you
[1:32:19] can pour in the oil and the wine of how
[1:32:21] God good is how faithful he is how he's
[1:32:23] he's not going to leave us in this
[1:32:24] condition he's come to heal us God Is A
[1:32:26] Healer God cares what are you doing
[1:32:28] you're pouring oil and wine into their
[1:32:29] wounds CU you think naturally who pours
[1:32:31] oil and wine into wounds Jesus is
[1:32:34] speaking about spiritual wounds you see
[1:32:37] and the Samaritan had the donkey to put
[1:32:39] the wounded man on to carry him to the
[1:32:41] end brother says it's the church right
[1:32:45] do we have the oil and the wine and the
[1:32:46] donkey and the
[1:32:48] bandages if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:32:51] you're you're carrying that medical
[1:32:52] first aid kit amen hallelujah so don't
[1:32:56] just walk on and say well that's them no
[1:32:58] we should have a concern stop say hey
[1:33:00] you okay how we doing the Lord's good
[1:33:03] praise the Lord oh they're so negative
[1:33:05] we'll become positive and they'll become
[1:33:07] positive say Lord whatever's on me will
[1:33:09] just go on them amen the joy of the Lord
[1:33:11] will yeah it's
[1:33:14] infectious praise the Lord amen
[1:33:16] hallelujah I see I've run out of time
[1:33:18] but you see now when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:20] comes into us he's got to grow
[1:33:23] right and we'll and and and I'll show
[1:33:25] you the scripture here see it says not
[1:33:27] self-will when God comes into the man
[1:33:29] into the heart which is the spirit then
[1:33:30] the spirit makes the soul and then the
[1:33:32] soul dwells in the body now when a man
[1:33:34] is converted say just um say just that
[1:33:37] little white button starts in his heart
[1:33:40] now that part is God and God when he's
[1:33:41] born again with the spirit of God God
[1:33:44] God's spirit dwells in him now as he can
[1:33:46] let that Spirit
[1:33:47] grow you got to let him grow let him
[1:33:49] take over your life amen that's why
[1:33:52] sanctification is an on going process I
[1:33:55] trust the things you used to do a year
[1:33:56] ago you don't do no more right and you
[1:33:59] can look back a year before that you're
[1:34:01] even more closer to God more Sanctified
[1:34:03] your thinking is more pure more right
[1:34:05] what's God sanctifying you he what's
[1:34:08] that God's spirit is taking over more of
[1:34:09] your life amen now as he can let that
[1:34:13] Spirit grow and take out all the roots
[1:34:15] of buness and press God's way through
[1:34:17] him again so there's all these things
[1:34:19] will come up come out of our life maybe
[1:34:21] our past or whatever more God's holy
[1:34:23] spirit's here to to take over those
[1:34:24] things but if we let the Lord deal with
[1:34:28] them amen how many men basically 100% of
[1:34:31] them won't go to the doctor if they're
[1:34:33] not feeling well like
[1:34:35] seriously yep we can't be that way
[1:34:39] spiritually that's right cuz physically
[1:34:41] people say oh no it's a pain it's fine
[1:34:43] she'll be right Nick minute stage four
[1:34:45] cancer why didn't they go I'm not I'm
[1:34:47] not saying that about anyone but it's
[1:34:49] just an example why didn't they go to
[1:34:50] the doctor when they first had that
[1:34:52] thing and they had the concern about it
[1:34:54] it's like spiritually something bit
[1:34:56] something in your spirit you go to the
[1:34:59] doctor the Lord Jesus the spirit in you
[1:35:01] the Holy Spirit takes over those things
[1:35:03] takes it all out of your
[1:35:05] life he can become back in the same
[1:35:08] condition that he was when he was in the
[1:35:10] Garden of Eden Jesus said in mark 11:24
[1:35:13] very very I say unto you if you say to
[1:35:14] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:35:16] in your heart but believe that you uh
[1:35:18] what you have said will come to pass you
[1:35:20] can have what you've said that puts him
[1:35:21] right back Supreme again puts him right
[1:35:24] back in the condition right he say well
[1:35:27] do I need to examine my life and see
[1:35:28] what's wrong no just love the Lord and
[1:35:30] keep walking with him right and anything
[1:35:32] comes up you say Lord I give it to you
[1:35:34] that's right and keep walking and you
[1:35:36] allow God then to bring healing and
[1:35:38] overcoming power into your life amen
[1:35:40] because it says in 2 Peter 3:18 but grow
[1:35:42] in grace and the knowledge of our Lord
[1:35:44] and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory
