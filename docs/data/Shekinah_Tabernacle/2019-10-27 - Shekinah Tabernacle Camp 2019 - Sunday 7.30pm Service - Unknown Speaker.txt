to stand where John stood in the book of Revelation 5 well here we sing a song that the Lord has given us amen because every revival brings forth music hallelujah and so here is a song here is a song that is expressing the revival of our body but also for everybody the Bride of Christ for John when he heard that the lamb had opened the book and taken it back for the human race who isn't glad about this event there's everybody happy about this event [Applause] [Music] I'm very excited about this event because all creation was lost unless this event took place and John was very sad when he saw the demise of the human race but then but then someone said we're not John and it's time to weep not Saints because our lamb has prevailed to open the word hallelujah our men are concerned he's my man he's your man he's a kinsman and John when he saw what he did as a human the inheritance that was lost by Adam he took it back to himself then as he represents the bride brother Branham said that John represents the bride and the vision he's rejoiced so greatly hallelujah that all heaven all under the earth and all on the earth heard him say blessing and honor and praise and glory so this is your opportunity you've aim in the word you live the life and some of you have been born again in these meetings and you can be born again ik in this meeting if you haven't been but this is our opportunity

look in the back of the book and see that we are already winners on that you have already won the battle for self no we're just here playing out the thoughts of your mind and oh god we breathe in each and every word that was preached each and every thought they come from the mind of God none of it as you've said before will fall to the ground the Lord will be able to manifest everything that you have for us in us in time Lord nor then we will be gods in your stead no no that we would be all that the world is is crying out for the Lord you've placed us in this position Lord as you did Moses you told Moses that Aaron be your prophet and you be God to the people so lord help us father to be a replica in your image and your your your very likeness Lord and always you sang tonight Lord and forgive us for all of our sins all our trespasses Lord even the small areas in our life that no one else sees but you know I'd keep your blood in our lives northern make us fit for the Masters use and although we pray that when these meetings are over Lord that you will just continue continue in the lives of people on continuing allows the people lower like you told them on the day of king of Pentecost you say pray until so father help us to pray and seek you until that day you come back to us on you know we love you and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ it's church say Amen somebody say hallelujah berries the Lord you know one thing about the devil he's very persistent he's a good adversary but you know what he does he brings out the best of God [Applause] God created his own weapon to bring out the best of him so God turns the devil loose and God says you make me great God he's already great huh he's already matchless huh oh yeah no one can stand with him no one can stand against him but he tells the devil I'm gonna turn you loose only so I could demonstrate how great I am hallelujah Amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to UM st. John chapter 5 oh boy when I get my voice completely back the devil gonna be in so much trouble so much trouble you think I'm loud now hallelujah but when I get it completely back I'm gonna be singing and praising and worshipping and they're gonna be like what's wrong what hinders down I'm gonna be giving God even more so you know we sing a song back home don't wait to the battles over the shop you got a shout now st. John five I know I'm sweet a man st. John five let's go to verse 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life amen let's go to Roman's to eighth chapter Romans 8 I love this chapter this is an adoption chapter hallelujah room is eight unless starry never 16 the Bible says the spirit itself bill witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together he made a lot of bless read of his word you can have your seats tonight by the grace of God tonight I want to use for a subject spiritual examination spiritual examination you know this this weekend there's been a lot of word preached amen and there's been a lot of spirit flowing amen but we want to examine ourselves in these last moments of the meeting amen and I want you to ask yourself am i healthy amen am i spiritually healthy you know in my Fit am I fit to run on with Jesus Christ is everything about my body everything taken everything operating like you're supposed to now I'm talking about your spirit man I'm not talking about just your natural flesh so what I'm going to be talking about is natural types but for the spiritual being now we know that God is a spirit and if we get anything out of the Lord it must come from a spiritual realm a man but you know there was a man leave his neighbor's brother down remember brother Chao but the dad was a very old Saint that was in the time of the Prophet and brother Tao had different occasions where he almost died and you know um the Prophet told him one day you know he was he was he was very sick at the point of death and God gave him a vision and he told him I'm gonna see you again and I'm gonna shake your hand and you know that day came to pass and brother Dow had a question he began to extra prophet he said he said am I am i healthy when I make it and the Prophet said well let's give you a soul of spiritual examination he said according to the Word of God let's give you a soul and spiritual examination he said see he said in God for the soul only has one instrument that's right that's his word we examine ourselves by the Word of God huh he says that's his word in Jesus and in st. John 5:24 Scripture we just read he that hears my word now that here doesn't mean listen a noise that here means to receive so let's examine yourself oh the word that you've been hearing hallelujah it tells whether or not your body spiritual body is healthy on whether you received it or not so there's been a lot of things going on a lot of us have been in church a long time but are you healthy are you receiving the word or are you just going through all the dynamics we need more than just dynamics oh yeah we need mechanics also honey we need to know what God said and how to operate in it we need yes I love to dance I love to shout but I dance and shout because I know what I'm talking about [Applause] [Music] because let's understand there was a lot of people that walked with Jesus that had dynamics holy Judas walk with the Lord holy in the Bible says he was the treasurer God then a devil keep the money see he wasn't afraid of any kind of situation God look look at how God treated his enemy honey God knew he was the one that was gonna portray him but God gave him a position in church to make him feel welcome he's nothing like us but somebody do you wrong you avoid them you go to the opposite direction when you see him you start treating them different look Jesus he said he said he said I've chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil jesus never told the rest of his disciples that Judas was a devil why because he didn't want to put the rest of the church in a mind battle so he kept the atmosphere healthy you know sometimes and we're gonna get into this sometimes God will allow you to see things in other people's life he'll allow you to see the different failures and different things just to see how you're gonna treat that person are you healthy to love like God loved and in Jesus His atmosphere was so healthy that he could let Judas betray him with a kiss how many of you let your enemies get that close I know y'all thinking this was the last service man I thought was go shout our way out of here oh we are we are because when you got substance you can shout oh yeah well you got something holding you look ain't none of us keeping ourselves this Jesus keeping us partying you say hello I got a hold on God let me correct you know he got a hold on you listen he says that here doesn't mean the noise it means to receive I'm sorry brothers I told him I didn't have any clothes but I'm that kind of person I don't quite know what I'm gonna do talking up here and you start pulling and I started being affected so your God talk to you tonight pull huh let's let's let's understand how this works I'm not a pastor I'm not an apostle I'm not a teacher oh yeah I'm an evangelist oh yeah so normally how this works you pull a breech oh yeah you pull up reach you quit I stopped you is this a sniff sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry are you supposed to be doing that tonight but you know what I love about Church huh Leah God we comes down in the mists he shows us that your life is not your own your life doesn't belong to you and that's the essence of Christianity young people when you walk away from this camp meeting I want you to realize if you walk away with anything realize your life just not belong to you your life is to do the will of God no my will we'll be sitting at home on my couch relaxing the God's will this jump on that plane for 14 hours

quickening power well brother Deeks I'm quiet by Nature okay he says John says they say John are you are you the Messiah in John listen to John expression from the Prophet to the master he says i baptize you with water unto repentance but he will baptize you with Holy Ghost and fire what does fire do with us fire you when fire touches you it makes you react fire will make you move fire will make you cannot you're safe we don't have a message of just repentance we have a message of fire where is the fire there's a lot of people got holy spirit the Sadducees and Pharisees had holy spirit they walked around their phylacteries on they knew all the Word of God but when Jesus came they rejected him so you need more than just Holy Spirit there was a time in Judas life where he had Holy Spirit he operated higher with gifts and different things he healed the sick he raised the dead he had holy spirit but when it was time to go to Pillar house but it was time to go to Pentecost and it was time for his nature to be changed he couldn't be touched by the fire solo give me that I'm quiet about nature's junk nature okay all right I don't want to do this but you put me out here [Music]

Philippians chorus Thessalonians y'all come in I will tell to meet somebody he's gonna tell the Church of Corinthians he's gonna say hey you see this man right here the love I was preaching to y'all became perfect in him huh hallelujah we got a revelation Nepal was written to this surge and I can see the efforts come up hey hey hey you see this guy's touch of effort you see this guy the adoption I was preaching to y'all he came into that adoption hey hey Hebrews you see this guy right here he was positionally priced in the Word of God everything I preached to yo he manifested and you want me to be quiet in your church [Music] you mad u mad u mad cuz I'm dancing and I'm shouting but what we saying hold my mu why I shout right here in front of you [Applause] first I can see who Leah in heaven they're gonna be all the people hold the saints of God then I'm gone already holy one of my good good friends who's going to be with the Lord now sister Brenda Lewis hardly she song she saw she wrote the song the more I surrender honey you know that one she wrote that song she also wrote harder stronger women in this church you know where that song came from she was sitting in a house in West Palm Beach Florida and there was a hurricane out in Miami with winds of 150 miles per hour and it was shaking the house and in the time when she should have been afraid revelation start dropping in the form of a song and right there in that moment when she should have been afraid words start coming like strong winds blowing with an unrelenting force it's gonna take her stronger win than this huh to keep me from my promises earlier so it didn't matter then it was a hurricane I danced copy get your top a song in a heart that was gonna bless the bride around the world and she's gonna be there testifying hallelujah but you know what I go by without telling everybody what God did for me in heaven it's gonna be a big testimony service we're gonna talk about what we came to what God did for us that church hallelujah can you imagine Harley good imagine no no let's change it let's use a word earlier that identifies the bride can you foresee [Music] can you look into your future huh you know we're gonna be in heaven we're gonna be shaking hands we're gonna be dancing and giving God praise and look Church look Church if you say hallelujah you gonna be up there and you're gonna be sitting in your seat and you're gonna be nice and quiet you mean to tell me why all of us are a ready the different brothers that are here we're gonna be worshipping and dancing you gonna be able to sit around us and keep your composure and that's just us while we testify now hallelujah think about the church Jesus hadn't even come in the room yet think about it think about it we're in heaven and we're all justified and the doors open up and the light comes in oh this presence comes in the room he hasn't even entered in yet but his passes for us him the glory of God comes in the roof and you mean to tell me you're gonna be like this I promise you you won't be able to keep your composure [Music] [Applause] if you can't get in the spirit down here holy death doesn't change who you are it only changes your dwelling place so if you can't worship down here you surely not gonna worship up there and you think when Jesus the King of Kings the Lord of lords come into the room you go keep your seat because it's your nature I promise you you or your seat won't be there [Applause] it will not be no place demons there ain't gonna be no preys demons the Bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that he is Lord holy [Applause] [Applause] let me ask you something if you think this is too much let me ask you something do you ever you ever read that quote that said if you got a problem with this you're surely gonna have a problem with heaven because this is the quietest place that you'll ever be this is the quietest place you ever be can you foresee worshiping the Lord for a thousand years and not getting tired we won't have to go to work tomorrow no school tomorrow nothing to hinder us is going to be everlasting holiday so if you can't experience the atmosphere of heaven on the side I feel sorry for you [Applause] because this ain't nothing when all of God's people get together touchy there's gonna be people there who will be headed and they gonna look at the crystal rivers and see that they got the head and you gonna tell that person to be quiet you don't say that person to sit down there's gonna be people that will burn at the stake and they're gonna look at themselves and they're gonna say look at me I can't be touched oh that's why I don't go to youth meetings because it's such a big show of emotion right I hope you don't really think like that cuz it's gonna be a youth meeting that's gonna shake the balls in Ephesians in Ephesians the Bible says when the graves cracking when the graves come open in the sky crack and will be changed in a moment of what we live in I all of us will be used again that's gonna be the biggest and greatest youth meeting ever hallelujah gonna be the biggest shoot meeting ever we will all change in a moment of a twinkle of an eye and that youth meeting and gonna be no 40 and above no 50 and above no 30 and above all of us are gonna be 18 to 21 [Music] sister-sister you oughta get in practice now you ought to take that bonnet that podge and let that gray hair cuz no gray go turn back just natural color and the day of that youth meeting oh you know everybody say we got the Holy Ghost you know the prophets say the greatest mystery is receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation yeah that's a finished [Applause] yeah receiving it without sensation but the person oh yeah and you show me a person without any emotion or life and I'll tell you that person is dead so how can you receive Jesus Christ without any kind of emotional shock that's the real mystery yeah we're not trying to receive the Holy Ghost without any sensation I want to receive the person and you look around every person in here has emotional and the Prophet said if you told anything without emotion is what [Applause] so church oh yeah don't come in God's presence expecting to control get out the way get out the way let God have his way get out the way not your will but his will be done oh yeah you know what I want to do this ain't even my message but just like I said you pull up great touch think about it think about it Church what is it gonna be let's look at let's look at what's not going to be
