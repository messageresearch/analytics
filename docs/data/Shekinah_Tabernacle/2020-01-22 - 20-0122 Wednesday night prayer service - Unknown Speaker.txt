unveils will it be a girl will it be a boy who knows he prays a lot anywho amen god bless you all let's turn in the scripture let's go to 1st Samuel 17 amen hallelujah I mean good to be in the house of the Lord once again amen you know God could do anything in these kind of moments you know we can't let's not put a limit on him and what he he can do with him all things are possible I mean let's go to 1st Samuel 17 well familiar piece of scripture just having some fellowship with brother mouth and he just relates something that brother Doug Baker said and I just stood something so it's amazing someone comes the other side of the world you get blessed they go on their way anyway first Samuel 17 and we're gonna read from verse 42 and when the Philistine this is David and and Goliath as we know and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance member he had been saying bring me a man for forty days and God supplies to the man I mean and the Philistine said unto David to my dog that I cometh to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air into the beasts of the field B&C David to the Philistine doubt comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom now defied this day will the Lord deliver me into thine hand and I will smite thee and will take thine head from the you know give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines the stand to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this what a prophecy he just said and all this assembly shall know that the Lord save Earth not with sword and spear but the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands and it came to pass when the Philistine arose he came and drew nigh to meet David that David hastened and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine and David put his hand in his bag and took hints of stone and slang it and smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stones sank into his forehead forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of his sheath thereof and slew him cut off his head their worth and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead they fled and the men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted and press and and pursued the Philistines until they came to the valley to the gates of Ekron and the wounded of the Philistines fell by the way to share him even unto death and unto Ekrem amen let's bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus we just asking dear God in this moment that you would come among us in a very real way Lord we want to thank you you're a supernatural God and Lord and as your prophet told us in your presence the supernatural is happening well we know that's more than a nice quote it's a reality so far though just Lord we just invite you into this little room tonight father may you anoint every heart dear god father anoint your word to every soul Lord I pray faith would rise in every heart dear God just father you know the battles we face law the challenges Lord that we may be meeting even now or tomorrow and I just asked Lord may you step on the scene Lord like never before I want to thank you Lord that truly is there's a man standing prison they can turn on the light Lord which is you O God father I pray you turn the light on every life Lord may bless this little thought now I pray father and just have your way in this prayer meeting for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats must have been a very interesting kind of a contest there you know we we see Goliath here's a champion so know he had fought many battles even Saul would would would tell tell David win when David would begin to testify to Saul how he killed the lion and killed the bear and he'll kill this you know Goliath the same as he killed the lion and killed the bear and you know and and and Saul being a natural man or I'd say being a man under judgment he would say to David but you're a youth and this man has been a warrior from his youth so no doubt Goliath had fought many battles and no doubt Goliath kind of was working out in his mind how this thing would work out you know who the Oh someone would come out simile armed to him with the same kind of weapons and he would he would face him in a certain kind of way and maybe Goliath had some tricks up his sleeve and you had to use this height maybe his weight as strength to his advantage and maybe you know it's like you know like a any kind of duel that's like a chess match where you've got your yo secret Yoshio your your secret finishing move saved up you know your up your sleeve so to speak and you try and you know work your enemy into a corner then you give the killing blow and no doubt Goliath had this in his mind how he's gonna face him maybe he thought he's gonna fight Saul because he was hidden shoulders above the rest but when the devil when the devil made the challenge God said I'll meet your challenge and I'll give you one that can defeat you so here was David now and and and we read in the scripture that when David drew near to the Philistine that the Philistine disdained him because here was an opponent that Goliath did not expect he did not expect the shepherd boy out of all the hosts of Israel with their shields of their spears and their armor and their muscles and all these things maybe he was thinking maybe you know maybe in his mind he member for forty days he he would go out morning and night bring me a man bring me a champion bring me someone to fight me and no doubt when he would look at the armies of Israel up there on the hill maybe you begin to think maybe they'll see in that one well maybe they'll send that one he'll begin to size up as enemy or the devil sizes you up you know the devil sizes you up and he's got plans how he's going to kill you but you here here was he was God's answer to the devil's challenged and he came David out and and it said that the the Philistine disdained David because now the the pride of the Philistine you know he was being insulted and my dog you come to chase with staves as this is this what you think I am I'm Goliath I'm a champion I'm the champion of the full-size I'm a giant look how big I am yeah the devil makes himself so big he can't miss him hallelujah so here he was but now what happens now if we just take the natural world and brother it if you've got that video soon not now but soon you know in the natural world if you go into you know you know if you go into the wild with these predators predators generally know how the prey will act so when it comes to if you're a prey item the predator expects you to run but if you do not behave like a prey item then the predator will stop and they hold on this is a different kind of animal so it's that's with anything you said you go to Africa you run from anything it will chase you it will kill you but if you stand your ground and you behave differently to the animals because remember a human has a different thinking say to a zebra or to an Impala or any kind of prey item in Africa we think different but if we think the same way as the animals will be eaten like the animals right that's the same thing now we are built the believers we do not act like normal human beings we do not act member remember this this battle we're in is not against flesh and blood as against spiritual wickedness demon powers and high places even right now the devil you are no doubt putting thoughts in your mind distracting you thinking about everything else but what God may be saying I mean but we must recognize that we do not act like normal human beings so in the enemy come singing us with a mind battle or some ought against someone or unforgiveness whatever it might be the believer responds differently to the carnal man hallelujah so now that's the same way if we were in Africa right now and there was a pride of lions around us I mean we would or should act differently than a zebra but some zebras are built a little bit different now just hold on for a second you know so if we it's like we were told your brother Gideon and so we're telling us never got like an elephant if you run from an elephant it will kill you but if you stand your ground it doesn't know what's going on and they showed us a video and maybe I'll save it for another day we'll find it first but they were with this guide who knew an elephant behavior very well and and the elephant and came literally right where the wall is where I am the elephant came right there this big bull elephant and how how it faked charged them up and did everything the the the guide said okay an elephant has to stand by something funny a an elephant X has to stand by something so even if it's a little bush or a tree it will fake charge to something and it will fake charge to something else and then it'll try to make another bluff if you run you're dead but if you stand still at one Stampede you kill you so there was a bush and a couple of trees and then the guide said okay he'll he'll fake charge to the street to this bush to this bushy and he's going to stop right there now you'd feel a lot like thankfully we saw them from afar we're in a vehicle it was they you know but that would be scary this big thing intimidating you're the devil wants to put his fear upon you and if he can get you to fear him he's disarmed you but if you tell him you tell him to take that fear and take it away in the name of Jesus Christ I mean he has no power if you remember the first house we ever lived in here and here in Wellington down down frickle Tennille is a demon spirit in that place because the previous tenant use it as a brothel and spirits go into buildings by the act that's done in the building oh my hallelujah think about the spirit in this place where God comes down and we worship women we praise him hallelujah the spirit in this place should be different to somewhere else in the world and so there was that spirit in there we we move and we started fighting we never normally fight I would go to work it would be like some big oppression spirit with leaf I came back home as soon as I saw the house I'd feel the suppression come upon me Christine saw a dark streak running around in the place and we realized we had to pray we realized it was more than just us in the place now the previous tenants maybe you know they just came under the influence that spirit and that spirit just ran right in their lives but the believer is different hallelujah so we knew we had god-given Authority we can cast the spirit out I mean in God not because we did any but God's sovereign grace he came down and he drove the thing up but when we were praying against it you know a real fear came on me I said Satan how dare you put your fear upon me in the name of Jesus Christ anyway cut a long story short that spirit was cast out of such a peaceful atmosphere in the house Christine even brought someone into our house it wasn't even a believer she came in and said it's so peaceful in here before that it wasn't peaceful but why remember the believer behaves differently to the carnal man right because we are different because God has made us different hallelujah so now so they say if you run from an elephant it'll kill you but if you stand your ground just like a leopard just like a lion if you run it will kill you because it will chase you because it's used to things running from it the devil is used to people fearing him and and just caring and saying oh if you just leave me alone a little bit I'll do what you want just give me a little bit peace oh no we are not called we are not peacekeepers brother Duane fear see that that Easter can be seen a few years ago in Auckland we are not peacekeepers with the devil we're here for victory total absolute complete victory I mean we're the devil you know what an unconditional surrender means the other side just gives up and the victor puts their terms on the on the defeated ones I mean it's like us this is not a conditional surrender devil I'll give you Monday's if you give me Sunday or you know yo you can have a part of my life if I get most of it no that's not how this works all or nothing I'm gonna take all hallelujah so if we behave we are not cool to behave like other people in the world who know not God everything that comes against us we're gonna behave according to the word that's why Jesus said someone smite you turn the other cheek they take your cloak or whatever give them your robe dude do the opposite of what they'd expect it disarms the devil someone hates you love them love your enemies do good to those who despitefully use you hallelujah now there's some yeah just just let's just put it on let's shout for a while I mentioned this a while ago but I thought I'm gonna play it make sure is it as a good quality now this is not a typical let's just watch this can anyone see that this is not our footage by the way that would have been real cool now watch this okay here we go now pause it real quick pause pause pause it now what's normally the outcome of that the zebra gets eaten the lion gets fat the devil thinks I'm going to destroy that person what unfortunately normally happens without the Lord the devil destroys a life or cripples our life remember there's healing from anything that that that the devil tries to do against us member so whatever the devil does it's not permanent because we have a blood we have a healing power I mean we have a full restoration promise we're living under a word of full restoration rights it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do to you it cannot be permanent you've got to remember that okay doesn't matter if you're in a pit if you're in darkness doesn't matter remember there's a way out hallelujah okay so that's normally now let's continue I like this here we go he's mama no mama oh yeah [Applause] hallelujah and you know what that lion realized that wasn't like a normal Debra now listen those things live in fear a lion is a fearful animal right the Bible says that the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom shall devour that lion thought it had breakfast but there's something in mama said no you're not getting my little one you're not gonna eat my little one for breakfast you may get someone else in the hood but not mine holler so she overcome her fear and she met that lion head on hallelujah it's the same thing with us friends it's something different about a believer I mean we don't have to say oh I guess so your things will never be the same note we can come against the enemy I meant take him head on a will one oh yeah Goliath I mean David hastened towards the enemy and ran towards him now he is Goliath with a shield and he's got as I'm a bear and things do you think now you know the hurt you're the champion of Israel's gonna come out he's gonna fight like this here comes a shepherd boy he's got his five stones his revelation and a script bag holy he's crossed the brook chair yeah I mean I mean he's crossed the brook he's on his way he knows he didn't brother BAM said David knew it could be done it was revealed to him he comes this enemy what's and then he sews oh no no normally when you watch a David and Goliath film he's David stumbling with some stones standing like this and Goliath is coming towards them like this that's not how it worked here comes David the time of talking's finished David prophesized The Devil's end that's why you've got to speak it you to address your enemy you're going to tell him your has outcome I mean you're gonna tell him your outcome and tell him his outcome that's what David did David take a life you're gonna die and not just you but the host of the Philistines are gonna freak to the beasts of the field into the fowls of the air and I'm gonna cut your head off hallelujah didn't have a soul but that don't matter maybe you're sizing up glass orders and I think that'll work yeah see so it's all the time of talking's done what did brother Kaiser tells the camp speaker outcome speaker outcome not well as me and how's this going to happen on speaker outcomes Lord they're all coming everything the Devils taken from me will be returned it's mine right now kaalia full peace in my mind peace of mind peace of heart holy all my all my doubts cast away all my unbelief cast away my mind bans my condemnation my guilt my shape Jesus take it all hallelujah so it says he hastened towards the Philistine was it he started running he ran he pulled the stone out started swinging it a third at the Philistine and he killed him he wasn't standing it cuz most slingers he the other hand back and they know he ran towards his enemy hallelujah you know the closest you get to a target the easier it is just kill ya you know what the you know what the guides say in Africa they say if something's charging at you and you're shooting it don't shoot it when it's 100 more meters away or 30 meters shoot it when it's right here that's why they can get it in the head don't shoot it in the heart get it in the head because if you get it in the heart while the blood still pumping and it can stick keep running but if you get it in the head it's dead and they showed footage where the guide actually showed them and they killed nothing as a Buffalo saying like literally with that standards they were right here and it landed and it ended up right there feet it's too big to miss you say that takes nerves of steel I'll tell you you've got nerves of steel I mean just yeah you've got nerves of steel we have nothing to be afraid of hallelujah take your slingshot you say it's not too much I tell you that slingshot in the hands of anointed son of God standing in his and his god-given Authority I mean and in his in his inheritance I mean he defeated that Philistine hallelujah and that same God is here today I mean anointing her people I mean not to kill people but to defeat demon powers to destroy their influence to cast them off people I mean to tear Satan's Kingdom down hallelujah we have to the believer acts different oh yeah the devil came against Jesus and Matthew three the great temptations he came against all the other believers but but this one was different hallelujah brother man said it's like he wins with your flow against like at ten thousand volt line goddess feathers all singed hallelujah it should be the same thing when the devil comes against Jews feel that same God as in you hallelujah he couldn't he couldn't conquer them in any way friends were unstoppable the bride is unstoppable I mean the bride is unstoppable you know General Patton there in World War two he just he just believed and just just keep advancing keep advancing don't stop so you get the devil you get the enemy on the run you don't allow him to reinforce you just keep pushing forward I mean you say well oh I'll go the bridge too far I'll fight a battle one too many no you won't amen because the devil says all you may have won before but what about now the same God that gave you the victory back then I'll give it to you now hallelujah there's no such thing as going a bridge too far who understands what I mean by Bruce you far that means you over stretched your supply line right we can't over stretch our supply line because the supply line is in us spring up her well with it my soul spring up o well and make me whole color is that way away somewhere it's on you probably they're great artesian well of the Holy Ghost I should be gushing out of you're gushing out of you oh you don't leave your water source it's in you amen amen we are called to conquer we are ordained to conquer all fear all doubt all unbelief amen don't look at the human part of you that guy will disappoint you I mean look at the eternal power of you I mean that word that's in your soul has been quick and alive hallelujah never you say well I prayed for something in it and and it hasn't happened what is time to God brother bran would say in Elijah and the meal offering he says this he says you he says you know here we could get a lesson from that the speaking of the scripture and first King 17 that if you have prayed and meet all the requirements that God requires you to meet and still he silent he doesn't say anything and you've met the requirements now what happens then if you know that you have met his requirements and done all you know to do then faith doesn't waver faith let's say that faith doesn't waver I mean faith doesn't waver it just stands still and thinks positive hallelujah thank you lord thank you Lord for the answer thank you it's here thank you it's on its way thank you your word is true thank you your word doesn't change thank you you don't change thank you you're my God thank you you purchased me I'm I'm a redeemed one your blood covered me you bridge the gulf between me and you hollow your blood put me back on speaking terms I mean you've showed me a part of your word in this day Holly I law hello Lou you've called me to fulfill the prophecy of this day glory to God thank you Lord that I'm your child you know I was thinking I I love the story of Mary going to the tomb and the resurrections taken place and she's looking where is he and she's talking this or you know there's a man that's that's that's talking to her and his woman why do you weep and she thinks he's a gardener and this is Jesus Christ as the resurrected Lord in his glorified body he sees you know and then he just calls her by name changes their whole life just his Mary you know eyes come open it's you oh yeah I was looking for you how to know where you were but here you are hallelujah and he says don't touch me yet cuz I've got to ascend to my god and your God my father and your father hallelujah here he is in his glorified state that I do say this you know if I my children are like me so they have you know to a varying degree to have my strength I have my weaknesses I mean because night cat you know human nature's passed down right so here is our Lord Jesus conquered death eternal glorified body Holly and nothing can hold him he conquered all things he's saying Mary I'm gonna sin to my father and your father so how I am you will be because we're family hallelujah here she is in a glorified State Mary you're gonna become like me you have a theophany body waiting for you well then you'll pick up the glory oh you'll put on a glorified body as well hallelujah I think about that quite a lot because here we are a word has drawn us I mean we just not here as a church people going through a motion and a a word from heaven has come down through a mouth of a prophet a man to get a hold of your soul a man that you would know oh yeah as Jesus hit the Mary Mary you can become like me you got a body waiting don't fear Mary don't weep don't be sad sure a lot of bad things of happening your life is turned upside down you didn't plan this but I knew it was coming but Mary don't worry you would end up like me what do you think they could give their lives gladly well you think the Apostles could look in the eyes of the same Sanhedrin that that had Jesus crucified and said should we serve God or men because they were thinking remember the Sanhedrin they put all the pressure here's all the dignitaries of the religious system of others Rael humanly trying to put pressure on these fishermen but remember they did not think like the rest of the prey like the rest of the people in Israel I mean because they had a different thinking they had the mind of Christ just like if we were in the Kruger National Park we have different thinking to a zebra but if we behave like a zebra anyway and that's not our mama we'll get eaten right but to date but they had the mind of Christ out because now God was in them so they didn't bow to the pressure of the age that you said should we serve God are you God or man who should we police real simple and they put pressure and they beat them with it rule they just rejoiced they said hallelujah hallelujah Mary you got a glorified body coming that's why this message just found you not to make you a different kind of person only you need to know body waiting for you this is a rapture call we're living in a rapture cycle we must never ever forget that amen so where was I faith doesn't waver it just sits still and thinks positive you I got therefore faith takes us everlasting grip around the rock of ages' and doesn't move it's taken hold it doesn't move that's why real faith doesn't fluctuate based on feeling it doesn't fluctuate based on how good your day's going amen it's actually no no no gods gods revealed it it's in a scripture it's quickened to me that's just how it's gonna be doesn't fluctuate that great fellow called faith I've often said faiths got here on the chest when he speaks everything else shuts up when faith says shut up and everything stops cuz he's the boss our human emotion shuts up our feelings shut up because he says that I'm in control of this battle not how you feel it's what you believe never and the devil say oh you don't really believe it then well the devil doesn't believe he just tries to put his experience on you that's not really true well he doesn't really believe it amen hallelujah she had met every requirement she had lived clean she hadn't lived decent she loved honorable she had met all of God's requirements but looked like he was silent God does that some time to test you to see what kind of reaction you'll have he says don't forget it if you pass over the platform you you're prayed for on the hands laid on you it seems like nothing happens that doesn't stop faith one but you have met God quirements now if now if you have met them now if you're holding back on God you know your heart condemns you you know if our hearts condemn us not then we have now live our hearts condemn us there's no need coming across the platform there's no need of asking God for anything because you don't have faith to receive it that when you meet every requirement God requires then faith steps out this is God as God I've met the requirements hallelujah why are you saying these things we've got to understand we are not here too big we don't have too big the devil to give up nothing we have a right to tell him get out and he has to obey your voice you say I've just been a believer a day you should still has to obey your voice hey man he said well I fall every day just get back up that's not him the fools at home that gets back up that's overcoming hallelujah Tim that wins the war amen that rights history that's not them that when the battle is in that when the war is the victor hallelujah you know Abraham Lincoln would stand for public office for about 11 times about that then he became president there's something NMC do I want to become president he failed many times but he got there how that's like us I mean we may found many times but we'll get there because his blood hallelujah he made an atonement for us he's gonna see us through hallelujah David he behaved in a way that was different to any foe Goliath met and Goliath died how about you you say I'm being fought the devil's fighting me fighting me fighting me you got to do something different than what normal people do yes you got to take God at His Word why is the city you know the gates of pearl and the New Jerusalem why is it called that because a pearl is formed in a clam by a little piece of sand that gets in and the and you know and it's an irritation and in the clam eventually it becomes a pearl why well why the gates pearl was like an irritation the devil fighting us creates an entranceway into the promises of God it's all for our good he say this thing's buffeting me and he's fighting me it'll just create an entranceway and to the promise of God I mean other people cower under it but now the believer says no this has given me an entrance this is for my good Lord you know what I need and Here I am hallelujah glory to God who wants an entrance way Amen say you know don't don't be discouraged keep pressing the battle you know Winston Churchill would stand and he would give an address to a school and you know what he said never give up never give up this is in the height of World War two never give up and he would make a famous speech winner when when when the chips were down and and and and they were wondering is as England really gonna stand Nazi Germany was already there on the French coastline Dunkirk it just happened England was against the wall and he would make a famous speech two words of this effect will fight them on the beaches will fight them in the hedgerows will never give up will never surrender and one man was anointed to withstand now that's just under Pluto this is in the political realm how much more the Bride of Christ holy will never give up doesn't matter how big the enemy hey David saw the whole host of the Philistines he says I'm gonna feed them all outside was here and I'm gonna end up with all of them holy it did and he had five stars in a script back because Goliath had brothers and he had sons it saw something in him said well if I gotta kill them all today well let's just get to it pablor a deal was an evangelist by the name of Peter cut right under the man's man mayonnaise just been satiated and and he felt led to have a meeting in a city and so he went into this warehouse wherever it was he began to wash windows and set the place up and the and the man who thought that he owned the town the bully he said no no there's no revivals being held in this town my town so he walks in there he's a big fella here to pistol ownership peter Cartwright's washing windows and doing things you're busy and then the man walks in trying to intimidate he had intimidated many people but he's gonna find out this guy's different just like that line found out that zebra is different and and and so so he said what are you doing in here I'm cleaning up we're having a revival and and and is it not no you're not not in my town we don't have any revivals here so you know Peter Cartwright stop washing windows rolled up her sleeves took off his coat whatever more he said I must fight if I must rain you know and and and the bully said weld yet there wouldn't be to have a revival I said well okay I'll whip you so it picks him up meshes and my little boots he's heavy had enough amen and he had the revival and that man came to the Lord they're a whole group of them came into one of the meetings and and they're a whole bunch of preachers were afraid to preach because they're intimidated by these bullies he he preached the meeting and before that he would actually whupped every one of them hallelujah he say you should people really do that they did that back then but brother Brown would stand there under the anointing and a demon-possessed man would come up before him so I'm gonna tear you limb from limb well the brand was trained to be a boxer but we don't fight against flesh and blood that may have been under the Philadelphian age or whatever age Peter Cartwright was in right there was something NMC I'm not going to bow to the intimidation of man and that big bully came up before brother Brown young a tear you limb from limb and brother I said no cuz you've challenged the Spirit of God God speaking through them you're gonna have confidence when God speaks through you it's more member member when you're when you're facing the enemy it's not you standing alone I mean he's actually challenging God hallelujah do you think about all of us who are married I mean when someone comes against our wives who are they challenging and who actually should stand up and take the challenge where is he you'll die quickly or slowly I'll see what kind of mood I'm in today no that's how it should be how dare they come against my wife hallelujah so now he's a part of the bride in his position the devil's challenging the bride of Jesus Christ and God speaks through the Prophet says because he challenged the Spirit of God you'll fall at my feet he's I'll show you whose feet will will fall on who he goes to swing he turns only falls down at his feet like a dead man why because brother Brad stayed in a spiritual atmosphere that man spit in his face trying to get him into the flesh but brother Brad wasn't and he didn't act like maybe other preachers because he was different we should be the same way people get mad at you they come against you you know that should be good you sure yeah good I'm on the right track hallelujah we must find if we must rain increase my courage Lord rest the battle like never before amen hello yeah I don't know I think it's brother Eid put it in the welcome pack on for Saturday what we need tonight is men a woman knows their position in Jesus crisis from this warrior David and when the devil makes his big boast sure he makes his boast he's still making his boast does he make his boast you're not going in a rapture you really think you're a believer there's nothing to this word there's nothing to this message it's just a bunch of whatever conspiracy stuff and y'all it's just a bunch of whatever he's making his boast but there's a people upon the earth I believe I'm looking at I mean they don't just talk about the message they've experienced the one who sent it which is our Lord Jesus Christ I mean when this puts on flesh it's too late for for some atheist to come and tell me God isn't real because I met him I mean it's too late for an atheist say Jesus Christ is not alive I'm sorry I met him I don't need to go back through history and they got all the archaeological evidence for everything from Genesis 1 till now to actually prove it in my mind it's real though I meant the earth or the book yes color yeah I don't need you guys to Peter Kenyon I don't need to go with the ACA's in Turkey I don't need to go to Jerusalem I made the author of the book hallelujah amen that is you know what is the evidence II he came out of the tomb I met him this became a living reality hallelujah more than books and tapes I tell you when you hear that seals I mean the first time I heard that seals I'm just going to talk to you a little bit when I first heard the seals I saw horse riders when I heard it again I saw the lamb come forth with my redemption he prevailed I'm in Revelation 4 and 5 is more than a chapter it's going to become alive to you he said where's my redeemer he sits raw from the eternities to you maybe lays claim on you says your mind puts you up hallelujah takes you to us bosom carries you away Oh hallelujah they begin to unfold the secret of your life in the word Amen anywho that's got to become an experience a revelation you know I read a history of the church and the Old Testament God was known by a revelation God became real to the people Abraham met God it was a revelation all the way down through they met God but then when the New Testament era came in and nothing against the people but the Greeks had it in their mind a revelation was learning and then that came into the Christian Church learning something they actually swapped revelation God revealing himself supernaturally to learning and that's been all the way down through but they're now in this day the church is built upon the rock of Revelation when God makes himself real to you that's why you can't be intimidated so people say well where is that you know people try and challenge you on what you couldn't remember it's not about what you can remember it's who you know and you'll find yourself actually living this out automatically without even being able to quote it chapter and verse that's why Paul meets God Peters already met God Paul comes and has fellowship with Peter Paul knows exactly in the scripture everything is he is a fisherman they have fellowship Paul shows Peter where what he's talking about is in the scripture it's the same God leading them that what how could they be preaching the same thing because it's divine revelation sure he makes his boast he still making his boast what we got Goliath and we still got David's two-color David's how you anointed on your way to the throne every enemy they'll come against you shall fall at your feet you would have confidence on the one that's called you not me the one that's called you that's where it's called you hallelujah we're gonna take the country friends I'm talking about the inheritance I'm not talking about this place it's a nice island but it's gonna you know good luck I'm not staying here you got to have they say Lord yes you may be battling something say Lord give me a revelation give me something in your word
