[12:04] to be here and just have a great time
[12:06] and be amongst friends i was saying to
[12:09] brother ben
[12:10] this morning that i i just i felt the

[12:14] so anointed
[12:15] and um you know we don't really do
[12:17] icebreaker services around here we just
[12:19] like the first service just starts we're
[12:20] just all into it because we're all just
[12:22] friends you know

[12:24] there's no resistance we just love the
[12:26] lord and we want to have a good time in
[12:27] the lord and we've made a big effort to
[12:29] be here so we're not just going to waste
[12:30] it by like holding back we want to meet
[12:32] god so that's
[12:33] that's that's what we're going to do
[12:34] this morning i mean so i'm going to
[12:36] invite brother ben up he's just going to
[12:38] come and say hello and um
[12:41] or my there is right there
[12:43] come up bro and then then we'll start
[12:44] some
[12:45] singing after that amen
[12:48] hello
[12:49] good morning
[12:50] god bless you it's great to see everyone
[12:52] here again today
[12:54] um praise the lord i trust you had a
[12:56] good rest and
[12:57] amen found the refreshing of the holy
[13:00] ghost last night
[13:01] and i it's brother isaac saying i
[13:03] believe we're in for another
[13:05] amazing service this morning by the age
[13:07] of administering to us and i'd also so i
[13:09] want to say welcome to you all but i
[13:11] also want to acknowledge
[13:13] the unseen audience here
[13:15] because you know unfortunately because
[13:16] of this covert situation we can only
[13:18] have 100 people on site and we tried to
[13:20] wrangle with the camp about staff to try
[13:22] and boost the numbers and all these
[13:24] things but you know it is what it is but
[13:26] you know there's a lot of people a lot
[13:28] of family because because we're all
[13:29] family right there's a lot of family who
[13:31] wanted to be here today and um so i just
[13:34] want to acknowledge them you know
[13:35] brother taswell and and sister laverne
[13:37] and the jeffrey's family uh they said
[13:39] they're gonna be logging in they wanted
[13:40] to be here so bad and so i'll say
[13:43] brother taswell family god bless you
[13:44] anyone else who's streaming god bless
[13:46] you we miss you
[13:49] we're looking forward to the day you
[13:51] know
[13:52] i think the first lockdown was me
[13:54] personally it was like a novelty last
[13:55] year but this one is just i say it's
[13:57] dumb you know in kiwi language but i
[14:00] feel like when when we can actually
[14:03] travel again there's going to be a lot
[14:04] of traveling just to see one another
[14:07] you know we had um last year uh was
[14:10] brother moore is he here yeah so brother
[14:13] mull was baptized
[14:14] and it was in a certain lockdown a state
[14:17] which we could kind of see each other
[14:19] but it was like you had to keep a bubble
[14:21] and all these things so i probably
[14:22] shouldn't be saying this publicly but it
[14:23] was like you could see the saints but
[14:25] you couldn't see the saints and it felt
[14:27] like it was like when the dead in christ
[14:29] you know they're they're just beyond the
[14:31] veil
[14:32] you know we can feel them we know the
[14:33] lord's here and you know we're excited
[14:35] but soon that bubble's going to be
[14:37] broken
[14:38] amen
[14:40] hallelujah but you as well acknowledge
[14:41] the unseen audience god bless you wish
[14:43] you could be here i know you want to be
[14:45] here too and one day we'll all be able
[14:47] to you know
[14:49] be together we were planning on having
[14:51] the big hall this year we were trying to
[14:52] strategize in these things but it is
[14:54] what it is with the lockdown but um
[14:57] yes i just want to say hello i just want
[14:59] to read a scripture that brother andy
[15:01] sent me in the week
[15:02] psalm 68 just just a few verses then
[15:05] we're going to go to prayer uh let god
[15:07] arise let his enemies be scattered let
[15:10] them also that hate him flee before him
[15:13] that's the devil
[15:14] amen as smoke has driven away so drive
[15:17] them away as wax melteth before the fire
[15:20] so let the wicked perish at the presence
[15:22] of god but let the righteous be glad let
[15:25] them rejoice before god yeah let them
[15:28] exceedingly rejoice
[15:30] that's that's us hallelujah amen we sing
[15:33] unto the lord sing praises to his name
[15:36] extol him that rideth upon the heavens
[15:38] by his name jah and rejoice before him a
[15:42] father of the fatherless and a judge of
[15:45] the widows is god in his holy habitation
[15:48] god setteth the solidarity in families
[15:51] he bringeth out those which are bound
[15:53] with chains but the rebellious dwell in
[15:55] a dry land oh god when thou wentest
[15:58] forth before thy people when thou didest
[16:00] march through the wilderness sealer the
[16:02] earth shook the heavens also dropped at
[16:05] the presence of god even sinai itself
[16:08] was moved at the presence of god the god
[16:10] of israel thou o god did ascend a
[16:13] plentiful reign whereby thou didst
[16:16] confirm thine inheritance when it was
[16:18] weary you know where the lord's
[16:20] inheritance
[16:22] he sent for the plentiful rain last

[16:27] to be raining in here and also i could

[46:38] make the sun shine again
[46:43] [Music]
[46:51] sometimes i soar
[46:54] like
[46:55] [Music]
[47:06] an
[47:07] unexpected storm

[48:51] i know the master of the wind
[48:56] amen praise the lord
[49:02] [Music]
[49:04] you know brothers and sisters we are
[49:05] going to be tested on just what we've
[49:07] said yes
[49:09] do you believe that
[49:11] because storms are coming over the earth
[49:14] a prophet preached the oncoming storm
[49:18] and storms are political economic demon
[49:21] powers coming upon the earth
[49:23] and we have to be prepared
[49:26] and enter into what god has said he
[49:29] expects all of us in the storm
[49:32] is that right
[49:33] praise the lord i'm just going to wait
[49:35] for the brother to put the um
[49:37] the uh we're not going to sing any more
[49:39] songs we're just going thank you
[49:41] musicians
[49:42] i i want to bring out a subject today
[49:45] that is very um
[49:46] pertinent to this hour i really
[49:48] appreciate the uh
[49:50] the musicians and the and the the items
[49:56] brother ben i i thank the lord that uh
[49:59] you're a man of vision
[50:01] and uh coming into this church here it's
[50:04] just like being in our own church at
[50:05] home
[50:06] and and all the brethren send their
[50:09] their regards to you
[50:11] obviously we can't have too many people
[50:13] here because of the regulations
[50:15] but our god is in control
[50:18] is that right
[50:20] but how much have you allowed him to be
[50:23] in
[50:24] control amen
[50:30] beyond the veil of fear
[50:35] god bless you sister for singing that
[50:37] song
[50:41] and i want you to look at the theme
[50:43] don't get frightened by the thing
[50:49] not looking through these eyes
[50:52] but looking through these eyes
[50:55] is that right
[50:56] he says you
[50:58] look with your eyes
[51:00] but you see with your heart
[51:03] and we are a prophetic people
[51:05] we are eternal beings god did not make a
[51:09] mistake with you
[51:10] you are here in this day because god
[51:12] predestinated you to be in this day
[51:15] he placed an attribute in you for the
[51:18] year 2021.
[51:20] he did not put you in luther's day he
[51:22] did not put you in wesley's day they
[51:24] could not live in this day and you could
[51:26] not live in that day
[51:28] and a prophet comes along and says
[51:30] apostle paul wanted to live in this day
[51:32] but he could not live in this day
[51:34] because there was another people
[51:37] and brother bradley preached what paul
[51:39] preached
[51:40] is that right
[51:41] and we are living in a day where a
[51:43] prophet preached what paul preached and
[51:45] we're seeing the same thing that paul
[51:47] saw
[51:48] and paul saw into another dimension as
[51:51] that right he saw beyond the curtain of
[51:53] time and a prophet went to that place
[51:56] because we're living in a day he says
[51:58] our the holy ghost has come to connect
[52:01] you to your reality
[52:03] the holy ghost in this day and the
[52:05] prophet preaches this is matching time
[52:08] our earthly walk matching our reality
[52:13] praise the lord
[52:16] that's good
[52:17] i like to see people who are right into
[52:19] it amen
[52:20] right while we're standing and obviously
[52:22] we are
[52:23] let me get my get my bearings here
[52:27] i got to get these machines all cranked
[52:30] up
[52:35] and it's going to get into some heavy
[52:37] duty stuff
[52:40] and now i don't preach about hugging the
[52:42] dog and kissing the cat i'm just i'm a
[52:44] kind of person i get right into it you
[52:45] know
[52:51] now brother branham said 42 times
[52:55] it's lighter than what you think
[52:59] is that right
[53:01] and in 1965 when he went away i was
[53:04] eight years old to don't calculate what
[53:06] my age is but the thing is that it was
[53:09] actually tame in 1965
[53:12] but the seeds were already laying in the
[53:15] people
[53:17] tomorrow i want to show you by the grace
[53:19] of god what is causing the world to go
[53:22] stark raving mad
[53:25] but not today all right
[53:27] let's read the scriptures
[53:32] now we're going to look at the events
[53:33] that happened in the second fold
[53:36] of the rapture cycle
[53:40] amen we if you've had a new birth you've
[53:43] already heard the shout
[53:44] a message has come forth is that right
[53:47] and an anointing to bring you to where
[53:49] the fresh food is
[53:50] and where the eagle food is that's where
[53:52] everybody is coming to that's elected
[53:56] and so we're in that second part of the
[53:58] rapture cycle by a new birth and god has
[54:01] taken us through a transformation from
[54:03] the earthly to the heavenly from an
[54:06] earthly economics and how would you say
[54:09] economy to a supernatural economy
[54:13] praise the lord oh my goodness me it can
[54:15] really start to burn you up but he's
[54:17] changing you for one thing to the other
[54:19] thing
[54:20] but we're at a junction time
[54:22] and he says that a junction time a
[54:24] trumpet is sounding causing a spiritual
[54:26] war but it's not just a spiritual war
[54:28] out there it's a spiritual war in here
[54:32] praise the lord
[54:35] by faith
[54:37] by revelation
[54:40] moses who was in a first exodus is that
[54:42] right
[54:45] refused
[54:48] he refused
[54:50] an earthly identity
[54:53] is that right
[54:55] refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's
[54:57] daughter see
[54:59] when i put these things in black up
[55:00] there that's what i'm meaning all right
[55:04] he refused being trapped in an earthly
[55:06] identity
[55:08] choosing
[55:10] rather to suffer affliction with the
[55:12] people of god than to enjoy the
[55:14] pleasures of sin
[55:16] for a season because he knew that the
[55:18] world was falling apart
[55:20] is that right this world's falling apart
[55:23] if it fell apart in the first exodus it
[55:25] falls apart in the second exodus and so
[55:28] god must get our identity connected to
[55:31] him
[55:32] and this third exodus because we're not
[55:34] going from egypt to a promised land like
[55:36] moses did we're going from an earthly to
[55:38] a heavenly dimension
[55:41] beyond the curtain of time
[55:43] praise the lord you're with me still
[55:46] esteeming the reproach
[55:48] of the seventh seal
[55:52] oh my goodness me
[55:56] oh that will make the pharisees upset
[55:59] greater rich riches than the treasures
[56:02] of egypt
[56:03] for he had respect unto the recompense
[56:06] of the reward for he forsook egypt
[56:10] not fearing
[56:14] what the people in power
[56:16] were putting into law
[56:19] is that what it says
[56:21] well i'm reading between the lines
[56:23] not fearing the wrath of the king for he
[56:26] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[56:30] so you mean i can see something
[56:31] invisible
[56:36] it looks like a paradox how could you
[56:37] see something that's invisible
[56:40] praise the lord
[56:44] god has brought you
[56:45] into a message
[56:48] to break the amnesia
[56:51] to show you
[56:52] you had fellowship with them before the
[56:54] foundation of the world
[56:55] is that right
[56:57] is that right do you believe that so if
[57:00] that is true
[57:01] in your theophany you are looking to
[57:03] this day
[57:04] yes
[57:05] and god has come down to have the same
[57:08] kind of worship
[57:10] he had with you before the foundation of
[57:12] the world
[57:13] but this is identification worship
[57:19] praise the lord
[57:22] this is
[57:27] heavenly lord
[57:30] you put a ministry on this earth lord
[57:32] all over the earth a five-fold ministry
[57:36] and i'm only just one small part of it
[57:39] brother alpha's a small part of it
[57:40] brother ben and all the other brothers
[57:42] and brothers that are ministers a small
[57:43] part of it
[57:45] and lord you said a prophet he's a
[57:47] watchman but you said also the fivefold
[57:49] ministry is a watchman
[57:51] and they are seeing what was spoken by a
[57:54] prophet and thus standing in a high
[57:56] place
[57:58] watching and seeing modern events being
[58:00] made
[58:02] real
[58:03] by scriptures that have been vindicated
[58:07] modern events been made clear
[58:10] by vindicated prophecy
[58:13] i pray lord come today
[58:16] lord i gotta get out of the way for this
[58:18] because it's too much for me humanly to
[58:20] preach it but i pray lord i give you the
[58:23] preeminences
[58:24] take over this vessel for your glory i
[58:27] ask in jesus name
[58:28] amen you may be seated
[58:33] now when moses was here in the first
[58:35] exodus of course he was in the first
[58:36] exodus he was living within the time of
[58:39] a superpower
[58:42] one that did not know joseph
[58:45] a superpower in this day does not know
[58:48] jesus christ
[58:51] and when you see a power that's there
[58:54] that does not know christ you know the
[58:56] world is going to fall apart
[59:00] but i want to tell you something
[59:01] brothers and sisters as this world is
[59:03] falling apart you are not falling apart
[59:07] he said everything consists by the word
[59:10] of god but when the god word of god is
[59:12] removed
[59:14] the world falls apart but when the word
[59:16] of god is received
[59:18] everything is established
[59:21] amen
[59:22] now observe what's happening to the
[59:24] world what is causing the world to fall
[59:27] apart
[59:28] you are
[59:32] you troublemakers
[59:35] because he said as a faith civilization
[59:38] comes up
[59:39] this civilization goes down
[59:43] so as god is bringing you to your true
[59:45] identity you are causing the world to
[59:48] fall apart
[59:50] so what does that make you the most
[59:52] important people on the earth
[59:54] so then why should we have fear
[59:56] but there's too much fear
[59:58] amongst the brethren and fear is going
[1:00:01] to go by the time these meetings are
[1:00:03] over
[1:00:07] i always say to the ministers give the
[1:00:09] devil no mercy
[1:00:12] is that right
[1:00:13] no mercy amen
[1:00:16] glory
[1:00:17] but moses esteemed the reproach
[1:00:20] of the seventh seal
[1:00:23] more than the treasures
[1:00:25] of egypt
[1:00:26] more than the treasures of a job
[1:00:30] more than the treasures of ambition more
[1:00:32] than the treasures of your own agenda he
[1:00:35] astined
[1:00:36] the reproach of that seventh seer and
[1:00:39] the seventh seal came to do something in
[1:00:42] your life because the seventh seal is a
[1:00:45] threefold mystery that's in the back
[1:00:47] part of god's mind
[1:00:49] and that seventh seal mystery picks up
[1:00:51] the people to fulfill that mystery and
[1:00:54] your eye people picked up by god
[1:00:58] praise the lord
[1:00:59] you're not an accident
[1:01:02] is that right so don't go around
[1:01:04] thinking that you're an accident because
[1:01:06] you're not an accident
[1:01:09] but the devil tries to get into people's
[1:01:11] minds and talk them out of the most
[1:01:14] important people on the earth
[1:01:15] is that right
[1:01:17] he tries to talk you out of it he gets
[1:01:19] into your mind got the greatest battle
[1:01:21] ever thoughts in the minds
[1:01:23] praise the lord but he was pressure
[1:01:25] tested
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] you need pressure testing
[1:01:33] because he says pressure testing brings
[1:01:35] the best out inside of you
[1:01:38] and i tell you something brothers and
[1:01:40] sisters
[1:01:45] god is making this age
[1:01:48] so difficult
[1:01:51] i didn't say the devil
[1:01:53] i said god has designed this age
[1:01:57] so there's no way for you
[1:01:59] to use your own self
[1:02:02] anymore
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:08] and i say praise god for that because
[1:02:10] we're living in a day of obstacles
[1:02:12] everywhere you go there's obstacles here
[1:02:15] political obstacles are religious
[1:02:16] obstacles but i want to ask you
[1:02:19] who permitted the obstacles to be there
[1:02:22] god dead
[1:02:24] praise the lord
[1:02:26] right let's go and we'll turn now to
[1:02:28] some of these things i want you to get a
[1:02:30] good grasping on this i'm going to do a
[1:02:32] teaching time i'm not an evangelist
[1:02:34] brother alphas are an evangelist
[1:02:36] and
[1:02:37] if i had to preach like him i'll be half
[1:02:39] dead already because i don't have the
[1:02:41] energy for that kind of thing
[1:02:44] i really appreciate that i really
[1:02:46] appreciate that fella
[1:02:49] now watch
[1:02:52] don't get these thoughts out of your
[1:02:54] head
[1:02:54] for by him
[1:02:56] by the lord yes
[1:02:59] all things are created there's good
[1:03:02] things and evil things
[1:03:05] you say god created evil i'll show you
[1:03:07] scripture
[1:03:08] in a moment
[1:03:11] that are in heaven that are in the earth
[1:03:12] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:03:14] thrones dominions principalities
[1:03:17] dictators feminists in power
[1:03:23] i'm ever getting heart palpitations
[1:03:25] already
[1:03:27] or powers all things were created by him
[1:03:32] and all and he is before all things and
[1:03:35] by him all things consist
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:42] so if that is so
[1:03:45] why do we have fear
[1:03:47] come on now we're going to beat the
[1:03:48] spear out
[1:03:53] and he's the head of the body and i want
[1:03:54] you to notice now if you read the crisis
[1:03:56] the mystery of god revealed it's all
[1:03:58] about the seventh seal
[1:04:00] is that right
[1:04:01] go and read it again and again and again
[1:04:03] and again
[1:04:05] because when you have it you think
[1:04:06] you've got it you haven't got it
[1:04:08] properly yet because you still got fear
[1:04:09] so go and read it again
[1:04:11] god is in full control
[1:04:15] and he's the head of the body the church
[1:04:17] now he's speaking about the second fold
[1:04:19] of the rapture
[1:04:23] who was the beginning the first one i
[1:04:24] did and that all things he might have
[1:04:27] preeminence
[1:04:30] over me
[1:04:32] and over you
[1:04:35] he's got to bring you to a place under
[1:04:37] the second fold of the rapture where you
[1:04:40] become a complete
[1:04:42] prisoner to
[1:04:44] him
[1:04:46] and a supernatural economy that you
[1:04:49] don't run
[1:04:53] you don't run it
[1:04:55] he does it
[1:04:57] praise the lord
[1:04:59] now watch now he's telling us that he's
[1:05:00] put on the earth all that is good
[1:05:03] all that is evil comes by him
[1:05:08] now watch
[1:05:11] you don't believe it
[1:05:13] watch this thing
[1:05:18] i form the light
[1:05:19] create the darkness i make peace
[1:05:23] and create evil
[1:05:26] this white man is not lying
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:32] i the lord do all these things
[1:05:38] so if he created the evil
[1:05:41] and he put it there for a purpose
[1:05:44] he put it there to bring you to
[1:05:47] perfection
[1:05:52] the prophet said there's coming a
[1:05:54] squeeze
[1:05:55] upon the earth
[1:05:57] and that squeeze is not a grab
[1:06:01] when i was in in another country some
[1:06:03] bros been a bunch of smart addicts they
[1:06:04] came up to me they held a snake
[1:06:07] it was a constrictor
[1:06:08] and they put it on my arm and it wrapped
[1:06:10] around my arm
[1:06:12] and you know i don't like snakes at all
[1:06:15] and it wrapped around my this thing
[1:06:17] didn't have fangs but it was a
[1:06:18] constrictor and went around my arm i
[1:06:20] thought and i've got a white arm but it
[1:06:22] was turning purple
[1:06:24] and it was squeezing and squeezing and
[1:06:26] squeezing and squeezing and my arm was
[1:06:28] losing its blood supply
[1:06:31] by the snake
[1:06:33] and i said bros get this thing off now
[1:06:37] i i was holding its head like this
[1:06:40] i didn't want it to have tail i haven't
[1:06:42] had a bite out of my shoes and it looked
[1:06:44] at me and hated me
[1:06:46] and i looked at it i said my i hate you
[1:06:49] get this thing off
[1:06:52] and as i pulled it off me it messed all
[1:06:54] over my arms
[1:07:02] now let's go
[1:07:03] i thought it could get its own back i'll
[1:07:05] tell you something
[1:07:06] we won't go there
[1:07:09] after this
[1:07:11] you sound we've got to come up higher
[1:07:13] now brethren
[1:07:14] after what the church changes
[1:07:16] is that right revelation chapter three
[1:07:19] is laodicea the legacy is still here in
[1:07:22] the spirit okay the church ages are over
[1:07:27] is that right
[1:07:28] it's finished
[1:07:30] he said he was in the church ages the
[1:07:33] high priest of our confession and he was
[1:07:36] he was interceding for the ignorance of
[1:07:38] the people the church ages are over and
[1:07:41] there's no more mercy in them but mercy
[1:07:43] is still here
[1:07:46] where is mercy
[1:07:48] where the word is
[1:07:51] he's still our high priest
[1:07:53] but outside of the word he's not a high
[1:07:55] priest
[1:07:56] he's a judge
[1:08:00] but he's our husband
[1:08:02] praise the lord
[1:08:04] it's the marriage of the lamb not the
[1:08:05] marriage of the lion
[1:08:08] is that right he's not a judge to us
[1:08:12] because we've already passed from death
[1:08:13] to life we've already had our white
[1:08:15] throne of judgment
[1:08:18] is that right the white throne of
[1:08:20] judgment is not for us we're already had
[1:08:22] it
[1:08:24] we've already been judged
[1:08:26] pure by the word
[1:08:28] a spotless
[1:08:30] bride
[1:08:31] praise the lord
[1:08:34] now you are a people of prophecy and
[1:08:36] everyone's going to get right into this
[1:08:39] caught up into the present tense
[1:08:41] of this day
[1:08:43] and you should be able to see the
[1:08:45] threefold rapture
[1:08:47] materializing all around you
[1:08:51] i hope you can
[1:08:53] not by using your eyes
[1:08:55] by using seventh seal eyes
[1:08:57] eyes that come from god eyes that is
[1:09:01] eternal eyes
[1:09:04] and there's something moving us
[1:09:06] there's something that and and we need
[1:09:08] to be stabilized
[1:09:10] and what stabilizes us is when we catch
[1:09:13] god's vision
[1:09:15] is that right don't use your own vision
[1:09:17] use god's vision
[1:09:19] praise the lord
[1:09:21] now let's look at this threefold so that
[1:09:23] those who are just young ones in this
[1:09:25] message can get some grasping
[1:09:28] the threefold mystery of god now i've
[1:09:29] combined the seventh seal and the
[1:09:32] rapture
[1:09:33] together
[1:09:34] this is actually just different
[1:09:36] expressions of the same thing
[1:09:38] they're right
[1:09:39] i shout
[1:09:40] as a message coming forth revealing of
[1:09:42] the son of man
[1:09:44] your husband to be
[1:09:47] now if he reveals himself he must reveal
[1:09:50] you also
[1:09:52] is that right
[1:09:53] he must he must come down and lift the
[1:09:56] seals off of your life
[1:09:58] to show you you're not earthly people
[1:10:00] but heavenly people because when you're
[1:10:02] born on the earth you're born under six
[1:10:04] seals
[1:10:07] earthly seals
[1:10:09] and you did everything that the devil
[1:10:10] wanted you to do the devil said dance
[1:10:12] you dance you ask them how long do i
[1:10:14] dance for
[1:10:16] you were born on the influence of six
[1:10:18] seals
[1:10:19] but he came down to break the seal over
[1:10:23] your life
[1:10:25] and to bring back he has the eternal
[1:10:27] thought into you he already had the
[1:10:30] eternal thought of you but he had to
[1:10:32] bring the eternal thought laying in you
[1:10:34] into expression
[1:10:40] after a new birth you come into this
[1:10:41] place here
[1:10:45] and that's a place of transformation
[1:10:47] amen and god is dealing with us
[1:10:50] at a particular junction in our life
[1:10:54] authority given to the elect through
[1:10:55] submission
[1:10:57] and prisonership
[1:10:58] to him
[1:11:01] god does not want your hands on your
[1:11:04] life
[1:11:04] anymore
[1:11:07] don't plan it
[1:11:11] i was a farmer
[1:11:13] god interrupted
[1:11:16] my farming
[1:11:19] i was never going to go in the pulpit
[1:11:22] and i hated the thought of ever standing
[1:11:24] in public and preaching because i
[1:11:26] couldn't speak for a starter because of
[1:11:28] all the problems i had in my life he
[1:11:30] interrupted
[1:11:31] my life
[1:11:33] he interrupts
[1:11:35] your life
[1:11:36] he interrupts every aspect of your life
[1:11:39] because he wants complete control
[1:11:42] so he can care for you
[1:11:45] he cares do you
[1:11:47] i'm not trying to be a poet
[1:11:50] now watch now
[1:11:54] let's just wave these quotes
[1:11:58] you want to dance you want to provoke
[1:11:59] the devil dangle a quote right in front
[1:12:01] of his nostrils
[1:12:04] now christ is a mystery of god revealed
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:07] and so many pharisees in the message
[1:12:10] don't believe the seventh seal is here
[1:12:14] now he said
[1:12:16] just look at the red there
[1:12:18] that's the reason under our seventh seal
[1:12:19] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:12:21] there was silence
[1:12:24] but let's read the rest
[1:12:27] and he has showed or revealed it in
[1:12:29] every type that's in the bible
[1:12:31] therefore the entire bible is a
[1:12:33] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[1:12:35] said the entire bible is an expression
[1:12:37] of one god goal that god had one purpose
[1:12:40] he wanted to achieve in the entire bible
[1:12:42] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:12:45] bible has been in type
[1:12:48] so if i want to see me
[1:12:50] i have to step into the footsteps of
[1:12:53] somebody that's already in the bible and
[1:12:56] and and god is revealing in my life what
[1:12:58] somebody has already done in shadow form
[1:13:01] and when i can see myself in the word my
[1:13:03] footsteps in the word of god i get
[1:13:05] perfect faith
[1:13:08] because perfect faith could not be
[1:13:10] preached to the seals were revealed
[1:13:13] he preached faith and pulsations of
[1:13:15] faith before the seals did he preach
[1:13:17] perfect faith because perfect faith
[1:13:19] comes by knowing your position in the
[1:13:21] word
[1:13:23] is that right
[1:13:25] and then he says
[1:13:28] and expressing god's great goal
[1:13:30] what god's great goal is and now in this
[1:13:33] last day he has revealed it and
[1:13:36] shows it
[1:13:39] now we're going to look
[1:13:43] contrast in the second fold folder the
[1:13:45] rapture are you with me so far
[1:13:49] does it tell you something you won't
[1:13:50] fall asleep
[1:13:53] i'm notorious for keeping people awake
[1:13:58] now watch this amazing quote
[1:14:02] and i bet you you all never saw it
[1:14:05] i didn't see it till the other day
[1:14:08] but there's one word i want you to see
[1:14:10] in it
[1:14:11] watch this
[1:14:13] now laid this here has a three-fold fall
[1:14:18] and we have a three-fold rapture
[1:14:22] but latest here falls in three phases
[1:14:26] and you have to see what's happening out
[1:14:28] there now watch the words of the prophet
[1:14:31] he says
[1:14:34] we'll go at the red jesus said in the
[1:14:36] third chapter of revelation that the
[1:14:38] laddesean church the ladies here church
[1:14:40] is the last church age and we are all
[1:14:42] believing that we're in the end time and
[1:14:44] this is the last church age this season
[1:14:46] 963 now compare this church age with
[1:14:50] that rich young ruler
[1:14:54] now he says compare
[1:14:57] them
[1:15:00] but did you do it
[1:15:04] oh my
[1:15:06] if you do
[1:15:08] you will know everything going on
[1:15:11] around you
[1:15:13] remember you're a prophetic people
[1:15:16] and a prophet says compare
[1:15:19] them
[1:15:23] now something just uh flew out of the
[1:15:25] bible the other day at me got me clean
[1:15:27] between the eyes
[1:15:29] i saw the rapture and something you'd
[1:15:31] never see the rapture in
[1:15:34] and you cannot see the rapture from
[1:15:35] genesis to revelation unless god comes
[1:15:38] and shows you because it's a revelation
[1:15:42] and you cannot learn it
[1:15:44] you can look at scriptures for a hundred
[1:15:46] years and never see what's in it
[1:15:49] until he comes
[1:15:50] praise the lord now watch this
[1:15:54] now you have to get the continuity of
[1:15:56] the scriptures
[1:15:58] so now this the what i'm going to show
[1:16:00] you now
[1:16:04] the lord is speaking about someone
[1:16:07] now he's got it in his thoughts
[1:16:10] and he's bringing something out
[1:16:13] and those bros that are listening to him
[1:16:15] think he's talking about something
[1:16:16] that's happening in their day but he's
[1:16:18] prophesying
[1:16:19] all right
[1:16:20] now watch this man he represents
[1:16:24] laodicea
[1:16:28] and you must see this
[1:16:32] and if you don't see this you will not
[1:16:34] be able to identify everything going on
[1:16:36] around you
[1:16:39] and he spake a parable unto them saying
[1:16:42] the ground of a certain rich man
[1:16:45] brought forth plentifully
[1:16:47] this is laodicea
[1:16:48] this is this age
[1:16:53] and he thought within himself saying
[1:16:55] what shall i do now the see has now been
[1:16:57] taken over by satan
[1:17:00] watch what satan said in isaiah chapter
[1:17:02] 14 i will i will i will i will i'll
[1:17:07] exalt myself
[1:17:09] above the saints of god i will
[1:17:11] and what is this man saying i will
[1:17:14] i will i will because because hell has
[1:17:17] come up on the earth
[1:17:23] and satan does not change his nature
[1:17:27] amen
[1:17:28] you're with me now watch now
[1:17:32] and he thought with himself what shall i
[1:17:34] do see it's i i i me me me
[1:17:40] because i have no room where to bestow
[1:17:42] my fruits
[1:17:43] and he said this will i do i will pull
[1:17:45] down my barns and build greater and
[1:17:47] there will i bestow all the fruits and
[1:17:49] my goods and i will say to my soul
[1:17:52] thou has much goods lay up for many
[1:17:54] years take thy ease eat drink and be
[1:17:56] merry and god said you fool
[1:18:00] i want to say to you laid this here you
[1:18:02] full
[1:18:04] you're so stupid
[1:18:06] you turned down the day of your
[1:18:09] visitation
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:15] so now
[1:18:16] jesus is going to enter and he's going
[1:18:18] to show the next scriptures you must
[1:18:22] catch the continuity because he's
[1:18:24] talking about laodicea collapsing and
[1:18:27] we'll take this in detail in a moment
[1:18:29] laser collapsing in three stages then he
[1:18:32] comes and he talks to the elect
[1:18:37] so now
[1:18:38] he's talking about a certain rich young
[1:18:40] man
[1:18:41] and his this this this this man he this
[1:18:45] man types this world out here falling in
[1:18:47] three stages while the bride is going
[1:18:50] up
[1:18:52] in three stages
[1:18:54] are you with me now
[1:18:56] now watch
[1:18:57] he has just spoken about the rich young
[1:18:59] ruler now this is your part
[1:19:03] now hang on to your seats
[1:19:05] put some foreign skirts
[1:19:08] watch what he says
[1:19:11] and he said unto his
[1:19:12] disciples
[1:19:15] therefore i say unto you
[1:19:20] who's in the age of a three-four-four of
[1:19:22] laodicea
[1:19:24] take no thought for your life
[1:19:30] he's talking about another economy
[1:19:32] coming up yes is that right where one
[1:19:34] plus one equals 29 if it has to
[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:40] take no thought for your life what you
[1:19:41] shall eat neither for the body the what
[1:19:44] you put on neither for your career
[1:19:46] neither for your job neither for
[1:19:47] anything he said he will take control of
[1:19:50] it take no thought
[1:19:56] for life is more than meat and the body
[1:19:58] is more than raymond
[1:20:02] and so you listen to the news media
[1:20:06] and the news media tells you a different
[1:20:08] story
[1:20:10] are you going to listen to the news
[1:20:12] media those bunch of serpents said
[1:20:17] the white horse rider is a news media is
[1:20:19] that right
[1:20:22] or you got to listen to what the word
[1:20:23] says
[1:20:25] because too many of you listen to the
[1:20:28] news media and you don't listen to what
[1:20:30] the prophet said that's why you've got
[1:20:33] fear on you
[1:20:37] is that right
[1:20:39] cnn says this is so just a bunch of
[1:20:41] serpents
[1:20:45] i didn't say i was polite i'm just
[1:20:46] saying it the way that it is
[1:20:51] consider now the ravens
[1:20:53] that was talking about
[1:20:55] his creation
[1:20:57] that never fell
[1:21:01] for they neither sow nor which neither
[1:21:03] have store houses nor barn and god feeds
[1:21:06] them how much more ye better than the
[1:21:08] fowls
[1:21:11] see when i come in the pulpit i'm
[1:21:13] telling you something's coming
[1:21:16] like a locomotive
[1:21:22] i don't go and preach
[1:21:23] a historical god
[1:21:25] i preach what is coming
[1:21:29] and god always goes ahead of the problem
[1:21:32] and prepares the people so when the
[1:21:34] problem comes you already got what's
[1:21:37] needed
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:47] i consider myself better than a stupid
[1:21:48] choc
[1:21:53] and which of you taking thought can add
[1:21:56] stature to your stature one cubit okay i
[1:21:59] i want to be handsome i'm afraid i'm not
[1:22:02] i can't add one part to myself
[1:22:05] i am made
[1:22:07] very thin because god wants me that way
[1:22:11] god has made each one of you
[1:22:13] perfect
[1:22:15] and you can't change your stature
[1:22:18] you can go and put some face lift on
[1:22:20] these landslides it's not god is not
[1:22:23] interested
[1:22:25] and you're trying to change one thing
[1:22:31] i will
[1:22:37] your thoughts like to run ahead of god
[1:22:40] all right
[1:22:41] he says slow down woman
[1:22:43] you're getting ahead of the lord the
[1:22:45] woman follows the man
[1:22:47] is that right you got to get it into his
[1:22:49] right order praise the lord he's our
[1:22:52] headship he doesn't want that woman you
[1:22:54] know
[1:22:55] getting ahead of him
[1:22:59] if you then be not able to do a thing
[1:23:01] which is at least why take your thought
[1:23:03] for the rest
[1:23:04] you can't do nothing you can't change it
[1:23:07] everything's stamped in prophecy
[1:23:10] now right you can't change the prophecy
[1:23:13] so you have to go and adjust yourself to
[1:23:14] the prophecy
[1:23:16] praise the lord
[1:23:18] he's now he's talking about the
[1:23:20] botany life now i talked about the
[1:23:22] animal life you talk about the body life
[1:23:25] see he's going through the book of
[1:23:26] genesis

[1:23:31] he's the one who created the heavens and
[1:23:33] the earth
[1:23:34] now he's talking about genesis to the
[1:23:36] elect look at the fowls look at the
[1:23:38] animal kingdom now look at the botany
[1:23:39] kingdom
[1:23:41] consider the lilies how they grow they
[1:23:42] tell not they spit not yet i said to
[1:23:44] them that solomon and all his glory was
[1:23:46] not a raid like one of these if god so
[1:23:49] clothed the grass
[1:23:52] which is today in the field and tomorrow
[1:23:53] is cast in the oven how much more will
[1:23:56] god clothe

[1:25:05] the world seek after
[1:25:06] but they want to rule their own life
[1:25:08] is that right
[1:25:11] and your father knows that you have need
[1:25:13] of these things but now this is the
[1:25:14] thing that's parroted by a bunch of
[1:25:16] parrots

[1:25:36] of god he's talking about the second

[1:26:03] then he says when you see laodicea
[1:26:06] collapsing threefold he said to his
[1:26:09] flock

[1:26:23] lamb's book of life
[1:26:26] is that right and the eternal section of
[1:26:28] the book of life

[1:27:13] will
[1:27:14] that is the kingdom
[1:27:16] is that right
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:22] let's just go
[1:27:23] a little bit further now
[1:27:28] i'm just going to flick through a few
[1:27:29] things i don't want to go and preach
[1:27:31] this whole sermon because it will take
[1:27:33] till tomorrow
[1:27:34] so we're just going to give you some
[1:27:35] mercy

[1:28:36] to get the connectivity
[1:28:39] all right
[1:28:40] it's a connecting time
[1:28:43] now let's have a look
[1:28:46] now
[1:28:47] here he is the rich and ron was speaking
[1:28:49] to the seventh seal
[1:28:51] himself
[1:28:53] and behold one came under and saying
[1:28:54] good master
[1:28:55] what good thing shall i do that i may
[1:28:57] have eternal life he said why call of
[1:29:00] selmy good there is none but good but
[1:29:01] one that is god but if you will enter
[1:29:04] into life keep the commandments now he's
[1:29:05] talking to
[1:29:09] the united states of america
[1:29:12] he's speaking to the last church
[1:29:15] and he's speaking to the whole world
[1:29:20] have you observed
[1:29:23] what happened
[1:29:24] to the united states of america when
[1:29:26] they turned down the day of their
[1:29:27] visitation
[1:29:29] what a garbage nation that is now
[1:29:33] it is the laughing stock
[1:29:35] it is in debt up to its ears and it can
[1:29:38] never
[1:29:39] pay back
[1:29:40] and rome is controlling it because who
[1:29:43] controls the debt controls the nation
[1:29:47] and here's a bag ahab
[1:29:50] being told by jezebel
[1:29:52] invade there invade there put boycotts
[1:29:55] there put sanctions there and the stupid
[1:29:57] ahab
[1:30:00] who's in debt
[1:30:01] has to do what that
[1:30:03] mongrel woman
[1:30:04] said is that right
[1:30:08] what about the world
[1:30:11] because this message went to every
[1:30:13] nation
[1:30:16] and they turned down the day of the
[1:30:17] visitation
[1:30:19] what happens to the world
[1:30:20] now watch what happens says here
[1:30:22] he said
[1:30:24] what jesus says thou shalt not murder
[1:30:26] this is not committed that you should
[1:30:27] not steal you should not be a fault
[1:30:29] witness witness are not thy father and
[1:30:31] mother and you shall love the neighbor
[1:30:32] as thyself
[1:30:34] so here he is
[1:30:36] standing in front
[1:30:39] of the seventh seal christ himself
[1:30:42] and he's trying to remain in a past
[1:30:45] dispensation
[1:30:49] your self-will
[1:30:52] must be a past
[1:30:53] dispensation
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] you cannot keep your own self-will
[1:31:02] that is a past
[1:31:04] dispensation
[1:31:06] that is a past economy
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] praise the lord now watch him now in the
[1:31:13] first part of the rapture cycle i should
[1:31:16] say in the first part of his
[1:31:18] oops sinking
[1:31:27] and the young man said
[1:31:29] all these things have i kept from my
[1:31:31] youth what lack i yet
[1:31:33] now self will and possessions
[1:31:35] i'm not saying get rid of your
[1:31:37] possessions but that was the problem
[1:31:38] with the age
[1:31:40] you're with me now the problem with the
[1:31:41] age because he types revelation chapter
[1:31:44] 3
[1:31:46] and jesus said if you be perfect go and
[1:31:48] sell and what you have and give to the
[1:31:50] poor and you shall receive treasure in
[1:31:52] heaven come and follow me but when the
[1:31:54] young man heard the saying he went away
[1:31:55] sorrowful because he had great
[1:31:57] possessions and this whole world is a
[1:31:59] world of great possessions
[1:32:04] and possessions
[1:32:05] are only a problem
[1:32:09] if it hinders a person from coming under
[1:32:10] hit headship
[1:32:12] you could have possessions but if it
[1:32:14] gets in the way of you coming under
[1:32:16] headship it becomes a major stumbling
[1:32:18] block and ladisian's pro ladies problem
[1:32:21] was that possessions became an idol
[1:32:27] now watch now
[1:32:29] so i i ain't even ever even hit anything
[1:32:31] yet there's only a foundation yeah
[1:32:36] don't worry i'm not going to keep you
[1:32:37] till 2 o'clock
[1:32:38] now watch it now which what what's the
[1:32:40] rich young world because you say i'm
[1:32:41] rich and increase with goods and have
[1:32:43] need of nothing and know it's not that
[1:32:44] you are wretched and miserable and poor
[1:32:46] and naked
[1:32:48] so now this man was facing a gateway
[1:32:53] the bible says in um 2 peter chapter 1
[1:32:56] an entrance shall be preached unto you
[1:33:00] at the end time
[1:33:02] and he's standing at the entrance
[1:33:06] to another dimension
[1:33:08] and he turns down the one who stands the
[1:33:12] sheep
[1:33:13] they the shepherd and the sheep fold he
[1:33:16] turns down the seventh seer
[1:33:20] is that right
[1:33:21] and he got locked into darkness and this
[1:33:24] world is locked into darkness after
[1:33:27] light has come
[1:33:30] is that right
[1:33:31] okay
[1:33:33] now brother brown says you don't have to
[1:33:34] die now to go to heaven
[1:33:37] you don't have to die to go to hell
[1:33:39] because why heaven has come down
[1:33:42] and hell has come up
[1:33:45] is that right hell is already on the
[1:33:46] earth the only thing that's stopping
[1:33:48] people from seeing that other place as
[1:33:50] their body
[1:33:54] so now
[1:33:56] laodicea was a
[1:33:58] attitude of self
[1:34:00] reliance
[1:34:02] and the lord
[1:34:03] is saying to john
[1:34:05] come up higher john you won that ate the
[1:34:08] book cut up higher
[1:34:13] i want you to come into a higher realm
[1:34:16] while you're walking on the earth just
[1:34:18] like enoch was he was not god took him
[1:34:21] enoch was he got commented into a
[1:34:24] rapture cycle he was not but he's still
[1:34:26] walking around on the earth
[1:34:28] and you if you've been born again i
[1:34:32] was not
[1:34:34] you are historically non-existent
[1:34:38] god does not marry
[1:34:40] a girl with a history
[1:34:44] he takes all your history and puts it
[1:34:47] under the blood
[1:34:48] and it's gone you're his
[1:34:50] you're historically non-existent
[1:34:54] praise the lord are you with me now
[1:34:58] stage two oh it's gonna get hot man
[1:35:04] you watch this
[1:35:06] stage two
[1:35:11] economic expansionism
[1:35:15] and the time of the door of the gentile
[1:35:17] shuts
[1:35:19] economic expansionism
[1:35:22] this too this is to this world now
[1:35:24] and don't be fooled
[1:35:28] economic expansionism is a sign to you
[1:35:32] it's over
[1:35:36] but if you don't see it
[1:35:38] by the scriptures
[1:35:40] you'll keep walking on thinking oh well
[1:35:42] in five years i'm going to have this in
[1:35:44] 10 years and you've got your own
[1:35:46] economic plan all laid out
[1:35:52] the ground of the certain rich young man
[1:35:54] brought forth plentifully after the son
[1:35:56] of man ministries turned down
[1:35:59] and he thought within himself what shall
[1:36:02] i do
[1:36:04] because the hell i have no room to
[1:36:06] bestow my fruits
[1:36:08] he said
[1:36:09] i will pull down my bars
[1:36:11] i've got an economic plan bros
[1:36:15] i'm going to go now
[1:36:17] next year we're going to build a
[1:36:18] building over here and we're going to
[1:36:20] get a loan for this and and we're just
[1:36:22] going to expand in the commerce we're
[1:36:24] going to expand everything
[1:36:28] in a time
[1:36:30] when it's collapsing
[1:36:31] and it doesn't look like it's collapsing
[1:36:34] but it is
[1:36:36] it's toastman
[1:36:40] he says little bride observe what's
[1:36:43] going on it's collapsing
[1:36:46] and it don't look like it's collapsing
[1:36:49] but it
[1:36:50] is praise the lord
[1:36:54] he says i will pull down my barns
[1:36:57] and so i forgot this plan man i'm gonna
[1:36:59] pull down my blinds i'm going to expand
[1:37:01] my business i'm going to do this i'm
[1:37:02] going to do that it's all right if god's
[1:37:04] leading you to do these things okay
[1:37:06] let's let's get everything to a balance
[1:37:08] if god is in control in your life you
[1:37:10] just carry on but i'm talking about
[1:37:12] looking at the world
[1:37:14] see
[1:37:15] and build greater and i'll bestow all my
[1:37:17] fruits and my goods
[1:37:20] watch this man
[1:37:21] what's the system
[1:37:24] what shall i do after the rejection of
[1:37:26] the son of man
[1:37:28] what can i do with my gift
[1:37:33] and let me say
[1:37:35] to people out there who turn away from
[1:37:37] the lord the lord does not take away
[1:37:39] your gift
[1:37:41] your gift will still be there in hell
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:48] do you realize
[1:37:50] this is going to stir the pot a bit
[1:37:53] these people who put on the internet
[1:37:56] things disputing brother branham will be
[1:37:59] still disputing it when they are in hell
[1:38:07] i hope they heard that
[1:38:11] what can i do with my gift an age has
[1:38:13] been trapped into darkness where it
[1:38:15] cannot see the cup of iniquity filling
[1:38:18] up
[1:38:19] so he says i will pull down my bonds i
[1:38:21] will build greater than satan has got a
[1:38:23] hold of the gift and taken it into human
[1:38:25] ambition a world economic expansion and
[1:38:28] he thinks these blessings are coming in
[1:38:31] us as a signers
[1:38:32] all as well
[1:38:35] not knowing it's a sign of the end
[1:38:38] is that right
[1:38:41] sobering ain't it
[1:38:46] okay well let's see that that's in the
[1:38:48] third exodus what about the first exodus
[1:38:54] banking building agriculture expanding
[1:38:56] before egypt fell and
[1:38:59] guess who it's picking up and
[1:39:00] influencing god's people
[1:39:04] therefore did they set over the task
[1:39:06] masters masters to afflict them with
[1:39:08] burdens and they built for pharaoh
[1:39:11] treasure cities that actually happens to
[1:39:12] be a bank
[1:39:14] a treasure city holds money for
[1:39:17] expansion
[1:39:21] cities and python ramesses
[1:39:23] and there were decrees that were coming
[1:39:25] forth
[1:39:28] to keep those people so busy
[1:39:32] with the dosh
[1:39:34] that they lost their spiritual sight
[1:39:38] is that right
[1:39:42] and the more they afflicted them the
[1:39:43] more they multiplied and grew praise god
[1:39:47] revelation is multiplied
[1:39:50] they're right praise the lord and the
[1:39:53] egyptians made the children of israel to
[1:39:54] serve with rigor
[1:39:56] it was a hard time
[1:40:00] while the expansionism was going on
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:04] and they made their lives bitter
[1:40:06] with hard bondage
[1:40:08] to make them all look like they've been
[1:40:09] baptized in lemon juice always like them
[1:40:12] look at sad looks on the face all the
[1:40:14] time you know
[1:40:16] with hard bondage and mortar and brick
[1:40:18] and all manner of service in the field
[1:40:20] and all their service
[1:40:22] holding the people in fear and bondage
[1:40:24] while an exodus was moving into reality
[1:40:29] praise the lord
[1:40:33] and there they set
[1:40:35] the power of egypt the power of this
[1:40:37] world and a total delusion
[1:40:43] now watch now
[1:40:48] now the soul has moved into a blindness
[1:40:50] to the prophetic and i will say to my
[1:40:52] soul so you has much goods laid up for
[1:40:57] many years
[1:40:59] all right
[1:41:01] oh i've just made my plans good man
[1:41:04] in five years i'm going to have this in
[1:41:06] 10 years i'm going to have this oh i've
[1:41:08] made my plans for many years
[1:41:12] he says that take long eat your ease eat
[1:41:15] drink and be merry
[1:41:16] man i have achieved so much
[1:41:20] oh i'm so great
[1:41:23] not nine dooms laying at his door
[1:41:26] you're right
[1:41:27] hope you're awake
[1:41:29] hope you're spiritually awake
[1:41:33] and god said you're full
[1:41:34] yeah oh
[1:41:36] oh i wouldn't want someone to say that
[1:41:37] to me
[1:41:41] now watch now
[1:41:43] so is he that lathe up treasure for
[1:41:45] himself is not rich towards god
[1:41:50] so it set up its social security system
[1:41:53] for many years
[1:41:55] oh it had its own pension scheme all set
[1:41:56] up and its insurance systems that set up
[1:41:58] investors and investments and he's
[1:42:00] laying up treasure for
[1:42:03] the system for itself
[1:42:06] but it's doomed
[1:42:11] it's toast man
[1:42:16] now
[1:42:18] just to stimulate you a little bit
[1:42:22] the cry in his soul had become drowned
[1:42:24] out by what he perceived was blessings
[1:42:28] and economic collapse always happens
[1:42:30] during an exodus
[1:42:32] with
[1:42:34] pestilences
[1:42:38] oh my
[1:42:42] get into trouble saying things like this
[1:42:46] ah
[1:42:47] pestilences is a part of the collapse
[1:42:51] but i'm not going to say anything about
[1:42:52] it because there's some pharisees that
[1:42:54] get very upset with me
[1:42:59] so we will avoid that and you have to
[1:43:01] read between the lines
[1:43:05] you're with me now
[1:43:07] all right let's go to stage three hell
[1:43:10] has come up on the earth to
[1:43:11] industrialize
[1:43:13] hell
[1:43:15] what are you trying to tell me that hell
[1:43:17] has become industrialized yes
[1:43:22] oh is that right
[1:43:24] oh my goodness
[1:43:28] and there's a certain rich man we've
[1:43:30] just read this before now
[1:43:32] what's the attitude of this man
[1:43:36] i mean the guy is so sarcastic
[1:43:39] he has got no
[1:43:41] compassion
[1:43:42] for the poor
[1:43:46] look at what this world's turned into
[1:43:48] brethren they don't care about the low
[1:43:50] classes they don't care about those that
[1:43:52] have got no need they just kick them
[1:43:54] around
[1:43:55] and watch the inflation watching
[1:43:56] everything going up and the amount of
[1:43:58] food that you can buy is getting less
[1:44:00] and less and less and less and it's
[1:44:01] engineered that way
[1:44:07] now call me a fanatic if you want it's
[1:44:10] engineered that way
[1:44:12] if you understand the seven seals you
[1:44:15] will know that under the fourth seal was
[1:44:17] what
[1:44:18] was
[1:44:19] famines
[1:44:20] pestilences and death yes
[1:44:23] that's right
[1:44:26] i hope you're watching
[1:44:28] modern events
[1:44:30] becoming clear by vindicated prophecy
[1:44:33] so you should not be surprised when you
[1:44:35] see these things happening upon the
[1:44:36] earth
[1:44:39] praise god i don't have any desire for
[1:44:41] popularity because i'm sure ain't with
[1:44:43] some people
[1:44:46] and watch now and design and this what's
[1:44:49] watching what's a lazarus designed to be
[1:44:51] fed with the crumbs which fell from the
[1:44:53] rich
[1:44:54] man's table more of the dogs came and
[1:44:56] licked the sauce see we don't care for
[1:44:57] you people mate you're just nothing
[1:45:00] lazarus was he lit
[1:45:02] can you understand me he's an elect seed
[1:45:04] of god in the bosom of abraham and
[1:45:07] there's a power who don't care one bit
[1:45:10] about you
[1:45:15] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:45:17] and was carried by the angel into
[1:45:18] abraham's bosom and the rich young rich
[1:45:20] man also died and was buried
[1:45:27] and he lifted up and inhaled they lifted
[1:45:29] up his eyes and began in torments and
[1:45:31] seeing abraham are far off in lazarus in
[1:45:32] this bosom now this man when he was on
[1:45:35] the earth he was giving out orders
[1:45:37] because he had servants now he's in hell
[1:45:40] and he's doing the same thing
[1:45:46] the spirit you die and does not change
[1:45:51] is that right it just
[1:45:53] all that changes is a dwelling place
[1:45:57] but the gift
[1:45:58] is still there it never goes away
[1:46:02] i hope some ministers hear this
[1:46:04] the gift
[1:46:06] never goes away
[1:46:11] and he said father abraham have mercy on
[1:46:13] me and sinful lazarus then he may dip
[1:46:14] the tip of his finger in the water and
[1:46:16] call my tongue for i am tormented in
[1:46:19] this flame now look at the world today
[1:46:21] it's full of torment
[1:46:24] brother branham says i see insanity
[1:46:26] coming up on the earth brother brennan
[1:46:28] was the angel with the seventh veil
[1:46:37] insanity i can tell you you do not have
[1:46:39] to wait for it to come it has arrived
[1:46:43] praise the lord
[1:46:47] and insanity comes by losing their minds
[1:46:52] but i want to tell you you have gained
[1:46:53] your mind
[1:46:54] you have the mind of jesus christ
[1:46:57] the woman does not have a mind of her
[1:46:59] own she takes her husband's mind
[1:47:01] praise the lord
[1:47:04] now what have happened to him
[1:47:06] hell has become an industrial complex
[1:47:11] fear
[1:47:14] medical engineered diseases
[1:47:17] hybriding dna
[1:47:19] knowledge now if you're in the i.t
[1:47:20] industry you can rest easy
[1:47:24] we still have to drive a car
[1:47:26] the car did not come from the perfect
[1:47:28] will of the lord
[1:47:29] you understand me
[1:47:32] the arms industry entertainment
[1:47:36] and where is this world today
[1:47:39] it's in a place
[1:47:43] mercy is fading out
[1:47:46] he rejected mercy so you see the first
[1:47:48] play you have to have a trial the trial
[1:47:50] is a great right from the judgment but
[1:47:51] now he's in a place called the prison
[1:47:53] house
[1:47:54] this world is in a prison house
[1:47:57] and the leaders of the nations do as
[1:47:59] they are told
[1:48:04] now we're going to go
[1:48:06] to this next part again while you see
[1:48:09] this
[1:48:11] take no thought
[1:48:14] now you got to be challenged on this my
[1:48:16] friends
[1:48:18] majorly challenged on this
[1:48:21] are you going to rule your own life
[1:48:24] are you going to let god do it
[1:48:26] it's going to cause a massive trumpet to
[1:48:30] be sounding in your spiritual life
[1:48:33] there are influences going on around the
[1:48:35] world
[1:48:37] that is so colossal to make you get
[1:48:40] caught up
[1:48:41] in the move of it now i'm just going to
[1:48:43] put down my computer from i'm just going
[1:48:45] to show you some stuff
[1:48:47] turn with me to revelations chapter 12.
[1:48:52] we're going to look at these things
[1:48:54] about what is happening now in the
[1:48:56] second folder of the rapture
[1:48:58] i'm just going to have to improvise this
[1:49:00] because i don't have any notes on it
[1:49:04] i want you to watch these things this is
[1:49:05] the second fold of the rapture
[1:49:08] just before the bride goes away and to
[1:49:11] eternity there is a power on the earth
[1:49:15] causing you to get carried away with
[1:49:18] that power
[1:49:26] oh my goodness
[1:49:28] revelations 12 the last maybe a few
[1:49:40] whereas verses this
[1:49:46] and the woman
[1:49:48] who's that the bright
[1:49:51] verse 14.
[1:49:53] we're given two wings of a great eagle a
[1:49:56] moses and an
[1:49:57] elijah anointing
[1:49:59] is that right what did moses stand for
[1:50:06] what did elijah stand for
[1:50:09] elijah restored the evening sacrifice
[1:50:11] moses brought in an exodus and brother
[1:50:13] branham had two anointings in his life
[1:50:16] is that right and we've been carried on
[1:50:19] an anointing of two wings
[1:50:21] watch now
[1:50:24] of a great eagle that she might fly into
[1:50:26] the wilderness into a place where she's
[1:50:28] nourished for time times and half the
[1:50:30] time from the face of the serpent what's
[1:50:32] that that's a body change
[1:50:34] now she's an eternity
[1:50:38] but in eternity there's no time
[1:50:41] all right there's no time in eternity
[1:50:43] but on the earth there's time
[1:50:45] so the only way that he could express it
[1:50:48] was by tate john must take an earthly
[1:50:50] perspective
[1:50:53] because there's no time and eternity
[1:50:56] he has to use an earthly perspective to
[1:50:58] express something
[1:51:01] and the serpent
[1:51:04] he did not say the devil
[1:51:06] he did not say satan he did not say
[1:51:08] lucifer
[1:51:10] now when he says that this is the thing
[1:51:12] you must get specific with words
[1:51:15] he said the serpent because he's talking
[1:51:16] about
[1:51:18] the is talking about the personifying of
[1:51:21] something
[1:51:22] remember in the in genesis chapter 3 it
[1:51:25] was the personifying of an anointing of
[1:51:29] satan
[1:51:31] is that
[1:51:32] right now watch he says and the and the
[1:51:36] serpent cast out of his mouth what comes
[1:51:39] out of the mouth
[1:51:40] words
[1:51:45] how is it coming out of his mouth using
[1:51:49] waters like a flood what is waters human
[1:51:52] beings
[1:51:58] water
[1:51:59] information
[1:52:01] coming out of the serpent's mouth
[1:52:03] using people using the news media
[1:52:07] care to try to carry you away in a flood
[1:52:10] of words
[1:52:14] a flood a flood is something that
[1:52:16] carries with great force
[1:52:19] and it's coming against you
[1:52:24] is it speaking to you
[1:52:27] this is serious time
[1:52:29] you must identify things by the
[1:52:31] scriptures
[1:52:33] not by some garbage can in the news
[1:52:35] media
[1:52:37] didn't say i was pc i just say it the
[1:52:38] way that it is there's a bunch of
[1:52:39] garbage cans
[1:52:42] to carry you away in the flood
[1:52:45] but praise god i heard another voice
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:51] i had another voice from heaven i didn't
[1:52:53] hear a voice from hell i heard another
[1:52:55] voice from heaven say john come up
[1:52:57] higher come out of the influences of the
[1:53:00] sin of the earth
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:04] praise the lord
[1:53:05] you want another one that was a that was
[1:53:07] the second part of the rapture now just
[1:53:09] before a body change
[1:53:13] is that a part of the rapture
[1:53:15] okay let's turn to luke chapter two
[1:53:22] do you know that mary types the end time
[1:53:23] bright
[1:53:25] is that right
[1:53:26] did you have a visitation from gabriel
[1:53:29] is that right
[1:53:30] did you have a visitation from gabriel
[1:53:32] yes
[1:53:33] but the bribe says gabriel come at the
[1:53:35] first coming gabriel comes at the second
[1:53:38] coming the lord comes down
[1:53:40] the mighty angel descends from heaven
[1:53:42] here comes gabriel
[1:53:45] to juan and he every time gabriel comes
[1:53:47] he says to my beloveds
[1:53:50] i mean gabriel comes he breaks the seals
[1:53:53] over your life
[1:53:54] and then he brings you into a spiritual
[1:53:56] war
[1:53:59] amen
[1:54:03] the devil said shut that guy up
[1:54:08] are you finished with the devil yeah
[1:54:09] i'll tell you something
[1:54:13] okay
[1:54:15] look at the two first one
[1:54:18] okay
[1:54:19] let's give them another good hiding hey
[1:54:24] and it came to pass in those days they
[1:54:26] went a decree my goodness me the
[1:54:28] politicians again
[1:54:32] a decree
[1:54:33] writings coming out of the power
[1:54:37] who didn't come from caesar augustus who
[1:54:39] caesar augustus he's a roman
[1:54:43] is that right
[1:54:45] and it's at a specific time because
[1:54:48] mary has met the angel under the shout
[1:54:51] out
[1:54:54] you got it now
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:56] she heard the shout out
[1:54:59] now she's going into the second part of
[1:55:01] the rapture cycle and there's decrees
[1:55:03] coming out under the second part of the
[1:55:05] rapture cycle
[1:55:07] to break
[1:55:08] her
[1:55:12] watch what happens now
[1:55:14] i love this
[1:55:17] and there was a taxing
[1:55:19] and this was taxing i should say
[1:55:21] that all the world should be taxed all
[1:55:23] the world
[1:55:25] now the word taxi means a census a
[1:55:28] collecting of information
[1:55:32] is that right
[1:55:33] there's an information age and the
[1:55:35] collecting all the information about you
[1:55:46] can you see modern events being made
[1:55:48] clear by vindicated prophecy
[1:55:50] they're collecting information
[1:55:53] biometrics
[1:55:55] all these things about you
[1:55:57] all for good reasons of course
[1:56:03] they're right all for good reasons
[1:56:05] they listen to those bunch of lies you
[1:56:07] know brother baby's politicians are of
[1:56:08] the devil
[1:56:10] oh but they look so nice
[1:56:13] so beautiful lovely
[1:56:17] bunch of snakes
[1:56:21] and this noise now and all went to be
[1:56:24] taxed everyone to his own city
[1:56:28] who was orchestrating this or above a
[1:56:31] door
[1:56:32] god was
[1:56:34] because he had to get joseph and mary
[1:56:37] back to a geographical location for a
[1:56:40] birth to come forth
[1:56:45] you're always blaming the devil but
[1:56:46] god's over the devil
[1:56:48] remember brother man says that there was
[1:56:50] just a two in the hands of god as a
[1:56:53] contrast and when the devil has been has
[1:56:56] been finished with he's toast
[1:56:59] praise the lord
[1:57:02] so i like to see people
[1:57:04] who can connect with scriptures
[1:57:08] there's not a time for a bunch of
[1:57:09] theories in the message
[1:57:11] is that right
[1:57:13] right now what's now
[1:57:15] and joseph also went up from galilee out
[1:57:17] of the city of nazareth unto judea unto
[1:57:19] the city of david which is called
[1:57:21] bethlehem because he was of the house of
[1:57:24] the lineage of david
[1:57:27] and god was maneuvering them back to
[1:57:30] their place of origin
[1:57:33] in a time of a
[1:57:36] squeeze is that right
[1:57:40] oh don't you just love it
[1:57:42] i tell you all right i'm
[1:57:44] i'm i'm just going to cut this whole
[1:57:45] meeting just short i'm going to give you
[1:57:47] just one more thing this message is full
[1:57:49] of the second part of the rapture
[1:57:52] i have to improvise this now okay i got
[1:57:54] no notes
[1:57:58] do you believe that joshua types the
[1:57:59] book of ephesians
[1:58:01] is ephesians the end time book in the
[1:58:03] dispensation of the film this time he'll
[1:58:05] gather all things unto christ
[1:58:07] all in the heavens and all in the earth
[1:58:11] and ephesians chapter 12 says
[1:58:13] there will be a shaking of the heavens
[1:58:15] and the shaking of the earth to shake
[1:58:17] down which can be shaken
[1:58:20] is that right
[1:58:21] and remember in the second part of the
[1:58:23] rapture cycle
[1:58:25] ruth is on the threshing floor
[1:58:29] she's already met the chief reaper
[1:58:31] brother branham now she's coming to a
[1:58:33] new birth in chapter three and she's
[1:58:35] gone to the threshing floor of boaz
[1:58:38] and now she's on the threshing floor
[1:58:41] because the wheat must be separated from
[1:58:43] the chaff on the threshing floor and you
[1:58:45] have a chaff nature
[1:58:50] so god on the threshing floor starts
[1:58:52] putting us through things and the second
[1:58:54] part of the rapture getting your chaffey
[1:58:56] nature's removed
[1:58:58] praise the lord because she came as a
[1:59:01] moabite then she was no longer a
[1:59:04] stranger she was a citizen of the
[1:59:06] kingdom
[1:59:07] then after she went to the threshing
[1:59:09] floor she went into boeser's house
[1:59:14] a body chain from the pistols to our
[1:59:16] father's house
[1:59:17] [Applause]
[1:59:19] now judah romney
[1:59:21] is the book before joshua is that right
[1:59:24] and moses is preparing the people to go
[1:59:26] into the land and the jordan river was
[1:59:28] the seals being revealed
[1:59:30] is that right
[1:59:32] moses had to go off the scene joshua had
[1:59:34] to come in joshua was there to place the
[1:59:36] people the holy ghost to come to place
[1:59:39] you
[1:59:40] is that right
[1:59:41] but when moses before moses went
[1:59:46] he said
[1:59:47] when you go into the land
[1:59:49] make six cities of refuge
[1:59:56] there's a mystery in the six cities
[1:59:58] six cities was a shadow
[2:00:00] six means the ways of man
[2:00:03] they're right
[2:00:05] and those six cities were there if there
[2:00:07] was judgment in the land upon you if you
[2:00:10] had committed a crime you had to rush to
[2:00:13] one of those six cities and go in there
[2:00:15] and go through the door into one of
[2:00:17] those six cities and then in that place
[2:00:20] you had safety
[2:00:21] away from the
[2:00:24] judgment i want to tell you the mystery
[2:00:28] of the six cities
[2:00:29] the six cities was in a shadow
[2:00:32] of the seventh seal because he's our
[2:00:35] seven city
[2:00:41] and in that sieve of seven city has his
[2:00:44] calm and be a prisoner to me in my
[2:00:47] seventh city
[2:00:48] don't you've got to be happy to stay in
[2:00:51] the seventh city
[2:00:53] because if you go outside of the city of
[2:00:55] refuge there's judgment
[2:01:02] and where did you preach that
[2:01:04] letting off the pressure
[2:01:09] so i'm not going to rely
[2:01:11] on myself
[2:01:12] i want to be connected to my tree of
[2:01:15] life
[2:01:16] amen
[2:01:18] have you come into the seventh city of
[2:01:19] refuge
[2:01:22] my dear friends
[2:01:24] musicians come forth please
[2:01:27] you come up here
[2:01:31] i'd like to go into the deeper things on
[2:01:33] this but i'm just hitting the highlights
[2:01:34] now
[2:01:36] fear must vanish
[2:01:42] don't you go listen to the the decrees
[2:01:44] of those bunch of serpents seed out
[2:01:45] there
[2:01:47] god's
[2:01:48] word establishes everything
[2:01:52] i don't care what they say or what they
[2:01:54] do
[2:01:56] when i was you know when i was doing
[2:01:58] missionary work
[2:02:00] people couldn't understand
[2:02:02] why i never got knocked off
[2:02:06] i spent 15 or 16 years in missionary
[2:02:09] work
[2:02:10] and i could have been killed a number of
[2:02:11] times
[2:02:13] i think so you never want to be you
[2:02:14] never want to go into mystery work it's
[2:02:16] deadly man
[2:02:19] and and all this time the lord was with
[2:02:22] me he was guarding me you know i can be
[2:02:24] a bit of a i can be a little bit too
[2:02:26] humorous sometimes
[2:02:28] but you know and sometimes human gets me
[2:02:29] into trouble just a bit but i would go
[2:02:32] into a place
[2:02:34] and there's these hoods who wanted to go
[2:02:36] and mug me
[2:02:38] after i've been serving gods
[2:02:41] and they see this
[2:02:43] see this this stranger
[2:02:45] in this village
[2:02:48] where a guy like me should not be
[2:02:52] and i'm going to get some
[2:02:54] a coke because it was a hard meeting you
[2:02:56] know
[2:02:58] and i was just dry my eyes dry as a
[2:03:02] no we might say i was drying there i had
[2:03:04] to go and get a coke
[2:03:08] so i had the winter space to get a coke
[2:03:12] and two hoods see me going into this
[2:03:13] place
[2:03:15] and god
[2:03:17] protects you
[2:03:19] the bible says the angels of the lord
[2:03:21] tempest their believer is that right
[2:03:23] is that so then why are you scared
[2:03:26] so these two hoods come up man they
[2:03:28] think here is a go
[2:03:31] they got within one metre of me and they
[2:03:33] turned into statues
[2:03:36] they couldn't move
[2:03:38] they were standing there
[2:03:40] they couldn't touch me
[2:03:42] and being a natural comedian
[2:03:45] i got my money out
[2:03:47] to pay the man for the coke and i stuck
[2:03:50] it right in front of his nostrils like
[2:03:52] that
[2:03:52] like this
[2:03:57] and i gave it to them sometimes i just
[2:03:59] get a bit carried away but i knew that
[2:04:01] they were paralyzed
[2:04:03] so i decided to have some fun
[2:04:07] and i tell you something brothers and
[2:04:08] sisters the angel of the lord was there
[2:04:12] guarding me
[2:04:14] in spite of my peculiarities
[2:04:18] he guards you
[2:04:20] you don't have to be some special kind
[2:04:22] of a human being brother branham says be
[2:04:25] the way god made you
[2:04:27] is that right if god's made you if god
[2:04:30] made you a little bit of a comedian stay
[2:04:31] like that
[2:04:33] as long as it's converted
[2:04:37] [Applause]

[2:06:03] a circle
[2:06:05] you know what traffic druggies are like
[2:06:06] they used to be in a bit of experience
[2:06:10] and you're handing out stuff around the

[2:06:15] a farmer you know

[2:06:19] walking around and there's something to
[2:06:21] see all these druggies
[2:06:24] and i'm heading straight towards them
[2:06:28] and a peculiar look comes over their
[2:06:31] face
[2:06:33] and they they look they're looking like
[2:06:35] this
[2:06:36] and i was walking straight towards them
[2:06:38] not knowing what they were doing
[2:06:40] and they parted like the red sea
[2:06:43] and they're looking
[2:06:44] what's going on here there's an
[2:06:46] anointing there
[2:06:49] see
