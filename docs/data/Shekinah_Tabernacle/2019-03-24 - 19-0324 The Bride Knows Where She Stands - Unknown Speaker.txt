Jesus Christ name the Lord we commit the service of your hands remind anyone who would like to help out with arranging there'll be a meeting after service and I'd like to thank you one who came up to brother Moses ordination I was wonderful to see everyone there and you all are on the blessing you are on the life that you look god bless you and a yes oh yes wonderful to see you all there and and they really appreciate you coming as well god bless you let's go to second Timothy four and we're gonna read up and we're gonna read ticket Timothy 4 vs. 5 - 5 - 8 is here but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry for for I am now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at the last at that sorry at that day and not me only but unto all them also that love his appearing amen let's go to Matthew chapter 21 as well just a bit of a maybe a bit of a context here Matthew 21 we're gonna read verses five down to 11 Matthew 21 I start from verse 4 Matthew 21 was all down to 11 and all this was done that it might be fulfilled with just spoken by the Prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion behold thy King cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a Colt the foal of an ass and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the Colt and put them and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and the great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I'd like to if I could title this I'd like to call it all that love his appearing now the word appearing in the scripture it means a manifestation and that is a specifically the advent of Christ a means that means that so so when he's appearing that means his manifestation and speaks of his Advent or a second coming now the believer loves his appearing I mean the belief loves his appearing you know we love it when he comes down and he manifests his word and he comes and lives in his people right so we have to have her I think we should just rejoice this morning because the Apostle Paul he had he had such assurance by the revelation he received that because he had fought a good fight that he had finished his course that he had kept the faith that he had a crown of righteousness laying up for him that the Lord the righteous judge shall give him at that day hallelujah but not only him but also all them that love his appearing amen so so that's a good way that you know you have a crown waiting for you it's because you love his appearing hallelujah I mean I'm glad you know you know there's something in us because it's when God comes and identifies himself with you hallelujah it means the world yeah it's not just us identifying ourselves with him yes where anytime mrs. believer yes for a Christian but it's when he comes supernaturally to you and identifies this as my bride this is my wife this is my woman hallelujah holy I am proud to be identified with this person I am not ashamed Amen to say this is mine I have redeemed this one she belongs to me I have judged her righteous because I took her sin upon me I took her judgment I mean in my court which is the only court that matters in this world and the next I have judged her righteous hallelujah so is something that we just love it when he comes and he identifies himself I mean saying this is my people holy and I think that's why we should be able to say we are not ashamed I mean because he you know isn't a tremendous it's more than just talking about him multitudes talk about him or talk about God or you know but it's when he comes down and when he Supernature who reveals himself to you he's saying you're part of me hallelujah so it's not just us you know it's not just us saying that we believe is it's him coming down and saying you're believers that's the thing that matters now it's amazing when you read him when you know you know we read this piece in Matthew that you know here here was the Lord as as brother Andrew seeded it and it really touched me all of heaven became you know the word became flesh all that God was he poured into Christ and they're very Lord of glory was riding into Zion was riding into Jerusalem all that heaven was was embodied in Jesus Christ all of salvation all of redemption all of healing all the peace hallelujah Shalom bride all the peace all the joy all the glory was had become flesh and that was coming into the city I'm in his city and yet the people seen who is this what's going on here what's all this noise why these people excited why they doing things that don't seem normal to the common day why they doing like this why are they not standing around in robes and maybe being like the scribes and Pharisees and being all pious why they shouting why they made me close down why they cutting branches down why they getting excited because redemption was coming into the city I mean the atonement was coming into the city the real lamb was coming hallelujah and the whole city was moved because God was coming into his city hallelujah now it wasn't just you know and they said who is this I say it was Redemption about to be manifested it was the real it was the real lamb was coming on the sacrificial grounds hallelujah the word it wasn't the prophecy it wasn't just a prophecy floating around that had been released it was become flesh hallelujah and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Galilee of Nazareth now they were close but they didn't quite get it it was God more it was the god prophet I mean it was all the Word made flesh coming into the city he was coming hallelujah but there was some there now this is I'm just going to dramatize this because this is just how I felt you know there was more than just the multitude stood up because of some excitement Peter was there who do the men say that I am you're a prophet Jeremiah lice or one of the prophets but who do and here the revelations thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah by Jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father in heaven has revealed it and upon this rock I'll build my church I'm going to build you on the revelation of Who I am in your season hallelujah so there was Peter here comes the Christ into the city hallelujah and you know there were the disciples maybe the woman at the well was there I don't know but there were more than just people caught up in the excitement of what God was doing there were those thing that were part of the fulfillment I mean of them coming to the earth earlier there were those you know that when the angel announced his birth he shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins right he died for the sins of the whole world to bring it to judgment but he died specifically for you for me hallelujah if there's only one it went to Calvary for Here I am lelou you that there's one going in the rapture Here I am holy I don't know about you but I'm going I mean because he can god I said you're part of this in time you're part of the word I can't leave here upon this earth I have to take you I have to change your body so there's one going give me that one but the key is don't look at everyone else around you oh I can't measure up to this person or this or I can't be like this person you weren't made to be like that person otherwise you'd be their clone but God God's not a cookie cutter right we have all part of the body to manifest and we're all made individual and God wants us how we are some are quiet blurry so I'm allowed hallelujah I thought then summer in the in the spectrum that's fine right be you you know the greatest victory we can have is when we get comfortable in our own skin there's a lot of overcoming right there when you're not all y'all this one trying to your head you're trying fighting and your five things now if you're just comfortable in your own skin then you won't compare with anyone you know all did your sim I love them for them but God made me me hallelujah that song you know thank you I made a Bible in schools yeah yeah if I was a fuzzy wuzzy be right thank you Lord for my fuzzy wasn't here and if I was a caterpillar or a butterfly but thank you Father for making me me because you gave me a hug you made me a child you know who gave me Jesus yeah who knows the song yes yes we need to learn some songs we but but thank you Father for making me me God may God don't make no mistakes do you think he made a mistake you think the mold was slightly broken or he had to you know when you're coming out now God makes no mistakes hallelujah he made you for a purpose and we were going to find that purpose it was to be the little toenail on the little toe hallelujah of the body upon the thumb praise the Lord if I'm the shoulder blade glory whatever I may be if I'm the bellybutton whatever as long as I'm part of the body of Christ that's all that matters Amen upon the coal and if I'm the small intestine whatever it doesn't matter if I'm just a little bit of the lung that absorbs the oxygen hallelujah I may never be seen but it's the inward parts that are most important it's not the outward bits that everyone sees it's the inward part of the body that's the most precious part of the body if you break the small bone in your small toe you'll know oh yeah why and in the whole body you'll walk different the whole body starts to walk a bit different because of one little break of one little bones and when when the bones not broken you never think about it a member when it's broken you're all focused upon it I saw stir s the n-word past many times that you know they're the most important bits but as long as I'm part of the body I can't remember who said it but even if I'm the skin on the bottom of the sole of the foot I'm still above the devil hallelujah so even if I'm the lowest part of the body I'm still above the devil I'm still part of the body Alleluia amen so the whole city was moved who is this it was God coming hallelujah to manifest the first part of Redemption now other Brown says would you see how this goes but you know there's something well it's gonna go I want to plow this through the believer the bride loves his appearing she loves how he manifests himself that she loves every gift right every gift of the body she loves I mean the Bible says we know no man after the flesh right this was his in Corinthians he this is hit yo we we used to know Jesus after the flesh but henceforth we know him no more that way and we know no men after the flesh so if we are cuddly minded we will know each other after our personality amen our culture our mannerisms whatever it is on that person does this and this unless they're different like this way that's been carnal that's knowing them after the flesh right but if we do not know each other after the flesh but we can identify that's the word that's the word that's the bride that's the bride that's part of his body that part of his body that's part of his body then we don't know each other after the flesh we know each other after who we are in him and that is the most important thing and that's why we can be so diverse as we are for many different nations and generations and whatever more I mean because we do not know each other after the flesh we know her if we know each other according because we're baptized into the same body by his Spirit Alleluia so the bride loves his appearing hallelujah the bride loves when he manifests his word Amen if it's even if it's just in a conversation or in a service or in a prayer meeting or have someone dresses or how someone acts and then we love when his word becomes flesh I mean the devil always hates it when the word become flesh I'm he he doesn't it's always when the word becomes flesh the devil begins to fight I'm in the scribes and Pharisees they would have spent I don't know how many years debating what's the Messiah gonna be like and they had the scribes and the Pharisees the Sadducees and believe in a resurrection that's why they said you see and you know and you know they never heard that one before dad you see that I believe in a resurrection and you know but they had all their debate and that was all fine but then when the prophecy became interpreted when God said no you have your ideas but I'll show you cuz God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass so we can talk well how's this going to be and how's this going to be like we can talk about the Millennium I'll say well we'll see it when it comes to pass and that's the right interpretation there on but you know talking about the Messiah and well may you he'll do this and maybe this and they had their ideas and how he was going to come and then God says no I'll show you I'll fulfill it but it's when it's when the Messiah you know no doubt many many fathers when they had their little you know girls about the right age a virgin shall conceive and they all thought no doubt my daughter is going to be the one my one is going to be the one and they maybe would have talked about and debated it and there was no reproach about talking about the scripture as an idea there's no reproach in that but it's when a little woman young teenage girl was walking down and Nazareth and a man appeared to her about six foot shoulder length here all of conflict um yo complexion called her by name Mary a highly beloved favorite of the Lord and they began to have a conversation and she said how can these things be she has trouble you know there you'll said fear not and then she just came to the conclusion let it be unto me according to thy word and then now she had a testimony she met an angel no one else was there no one else was there when it happened but she met an angel she met one who was saying the prophecy maybe you heard about in the synagogue lujah is no longer just a prophecy it's going to become reality it's gonna become present hallelujah and then she and it and that's the thing now you imagine that an angel comes to you you're going in a rapture you're the Bride of Christ you're gonna fulfill you're gonna break the cycle of death I mean you're going to break the cycle of the ages that you will not die but you're gonna you're your atoms are going to be changed you know we made in the image of the word amen and God's gonna come and take you from this world hallelujah you know and wouldn't you think everyone would be happy for you wouldn't you think that that's like Mary I made an angel imagine that she walked under wishes going she comes back into the house she would have been you would have been him you'd be impacted by having that kind of visitation you'd be different maybe she walked in a little bit different I don't know people say you okay Mary you're thinking how can I know she's no doubt thinking how can I just how how can I share this how can I tell them what just happened cuz it it's very hard to explain when God comes it's very hard to really give the magnitude of when he steps into a place and he speaks and he calls you by name and he changes your life you're gonna try and put it in words but unless you've had the experience I mean it's very hard to you know put yourself there and then so maybe she said I was walking to the well I don't know wishes go just say sure yeah just say she's going to the well I meet a man it's a different kind of a man there's such an atmosphere around him and he and he knew my name and I didn't know how he knew my name and he said he is he was Gabriel than you who Gabriel was hallelujah and he said I'm going to have the Messiah I'm going to be the Virgin that's gonna conceive and I said let it be unto me according to thy word now what do you think people see are you sure has your engagement with Joseph going amen everyone wasn't the whole world wasn't excited it wasn't front-page news the Messiah's coming to the earth Isaiah seminars there 9 is being fulfilled holy it's no longer promises week coming reality they weren't all excited I mean she received a you know what they call the black name against her you know our Joseph was just trying to cover it up and all these things but she met the angel and our testimonies will bring her approach amen hey you follow me not even one will rejoice with you not everyone will rejoice with you but their doesn't really matter God's rejoicing with you God's happy God's happy five more life on faith when I come back to the earth and we should scream Here I am I'm here you will find faith because you've given me the faith of the Son of God Here I am hallelujah where the answer to that question I mean so minute gyro saw L saw her testimony was her approach to her but she made an angel and no one could talk her out of it and it doesn't matter how pregnant she became she knew that that child was God's God created the egg and the sperm God created the body of Christ in her womb it was God's doing it doesn't matter what people said God said hallelujah hallelujah so now that's why we've just got overjoyed what is God you know I trust he's called you amen and he called you for a purpose we're not here just to have some kind of religion and we're here to go on a rapture I mean we have yeah the Prophet told us when when the token was put on display in in in Egypt it was a sure token I mean it was a guaranteed sure token then the first bomb could not die I mean if the token was applied it was a sure definite 100 percent it will work there was no doubt if they followed the prophets instructions death would not track the house I mean and we've received amen of Moses in our day I mean he's given us a clear your interpretation of the scripture and if we follow it well what was the first thing you'd repent and be baptized every one even name our Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you whose you amen and those are a far-off who's them and meaning it's the Lord our God shall call hallelujah so yeah we've received and we received Bible evidence and it works well what's that Bible evidence God comes and lives God confirms his word with signs following I mean God changes the life it's not us transforming trying to change ourselves it's God changing us hallelujah so now so the people in Egypt the firstborns brother brown dramatized he says you know the first of all hey daddy hey sure is everything going to be okay you know I can hear the screams out of the Egyptians and everyone who has and applied the blood is everything going to be okay and you can say yes son we're followed a vindicated prophets voice I mean that same God that's brought judgment upon Egypt has brought us deliverance and we're leaving this place the bloods on the door lintel we have in faith we have applied the blood in faith we have received the word in faith we've done what God has commanded us to do and we are sure among friends God said Let there be Sun Moon and stars and what do you see when you look at the night sky when there's no city lights moon and stars he said let there be this earth what do we you know it's here right when he said let it know I'll be a bit ridiculous but when he said let there be you know let there be this earth it's not a doughnut in the sky it's not a flat earth on four elephants on a tortoise it's not something that when he said it was it became he followed me it's not something completely different I mean so when God promises something it has to happen you follow me so when he said apply the blood the first one won't die death will not strike what happened death did it strike I mean when he said to Moses raise up your rod before the Red Sea where what happened the Red Sea parted I mean when they went to Jericho and Joshua was taught by the angel of the Lord to too much around and so on what happened the walls fell down flat hallelujah you just go through the scripture God's promise and God's promise that he does exactly what he's promised I mean so we could have supreme confidence if he did it all the way back there and if you were back there you would be a believer hallelujah if you are the same generation as Caleb and Joshua there would have been three that went into land Caleb Joshua and you hallelujah hallelujah why could you you know if you're living the days of Noah there would have been nine in the ark yes Damon you hallelujah why because the same faith you have you would have had the same faith back then because me but man doesn't change whatever you are now you would have been back then if you make believer now you be you make believe it in if you're a dad and now you'll be a doubter then but if you're believing now you'll be a believer then hallelujah so we don't need to worry did the blood work back there if couldn't strike death could not strike the house because the blood was applied and we have more than just a chemistry of a blood we have the life that was in the blood when Jesus went to Calvary amen his blood was shed the life in him was released Holly there could come upon a people and transform them and make them like him hallelujah hallelujah that's a short token amen I met a face death your death has to flee if he's in the house it has to flee because now there is life with darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt I mean because he is here he's in the house I'm not just talking about these four walls in you why is your an atmosphere in this place every service cuz you I mean cuz gods and you you come you say well I'm not an important part of the body hallelujah you create an atmosphere around you that's why we should come to church early you say well I don't prioritize I don't pray in the back room you can just sit here and just begin to sing in your house this little item I'm gonna let it shine all this little light of mine oh I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine [Laughter] only you can just sit there singing your heart what happens the atmosphere around you changes brother I might sit on Wednesday the devil doesn't know what you're thinking but God does how do you be in your Pew having a revival before I even the song leader anyone begins to play and

what happens that you begin a crane atmosphere and God God comes by this is all my children are worshiping hallelujah he loves to worship God loves to worship he said I think I'll come join the morning stand with him come angels gather around hallelujah what's my redeem ones watch the workmanship of my hands watch my salvation hallelujah and then he comes down among us hallelujah hallelujah amen at least I just limit the earth in tongues could happen then prophecy could happen deliverance could happen healing could happen the Holy Ghost would come and throw hallelujah redemption could happen all those in love his appearing appearing in his people this is God manifesting himself and the bride loves it well it's right good to see you here today Jesus hallelujah I've had a pretty tough week but it's so good to be here I'm so glad I'm in your hiding place oh yeah hallelujah I'm hidden away in you the devil tries to do I mean we have an overcoming power I mean that's why we need to keep our confidence in the Lord we don't have confidence in the flesh or even this world we have confidence in our Lord Jesus Christ hello Lily and then he comes John tell me all about it polio tell me about your day you know God likes that oh yeah tell me about it well this hapless are really oh my he knows all about it but he wants you to tell you hey well sorry you two tell him rather I mean that's why I came down the garden had him an evil fallen Adam where are you Adam Adam he knew where they were he's got the best GPS at all anywhere they were but he comes down to our level and he wants us to respond amen have a revival you say well you know said it honestly you just said you say well you know just sing in your heart even even at school at work driving down the road wherever you may be singing the Lord sing spiritual Sam's in your heart to Lord say hallelujah because our life is a worship it's not just here and singing in specials and music it's our life as a worship to God hallelujah to God and I wanna I want to worship Him amen brother Craig bull said it camping you know he used the story of of when the King of England went to Canada and all the schoolchildren in one lined the streets where he was going and you know the school's reamed out there given Union Jackson Jackson Canadian flags that waving their flags is the King wink past that everyone went back to school and then in one class they couldn't find a little girl so they begin to search and searched and searched and they found her in a corner on the street crying in the corner and then the teacher picked her up sighs what's wrong did you see the King yes or the King did you wave your flag y'all waved your flag well what's wrong I don't know if the King saw me Jesus away ceases waving at our flag Alou yeah hey we are never unnoticed I mean we never passed over he always sees this way we may be the littlest one in the crowd I doubt tippy-toes like this Ilia do you see my flag look he sees it hallelujah amen I think we should wave a flag hallelujah hurry to God now so he says here and we would see Jesus this is a 1962 he says now same thing today I'm sorry this is the in time evangelism 62 well same thing today when you see his work now we have already seen in a witnessing the appearing of the Lord now remember the appearing in the coming as two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now it's a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the Holy Spirit doing so that's the appearing of the Lord now you remember it spoken both places appearing and coming now we're going to come back to that he says also here cousin we would see Jesus after 2,000 years we see the infallible proof that we can still see Jesus he's appearing in our myths he's appearing in our myths hallelujah just before us coming he's making his appearance in his church the last sign that he did before the Jews and he was he was finished with them the last sign that he given before the Gentiles was finished in his being showed we know that that was the last time that Abraham got before Sodom burned it was the last time we realized that the ministers out there at Sodom tonight bring revivals going on through Chicago and across the world great signs and wonders are taking place ministers preaching crying their hearts out pastors are pleading and begging great wonders are being done by the Holy Ghost throughout the world healing signs and wonders we are so he says he's appearing among us hallelujah hallelujah but now brother Brown picks up 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 he says the Lord does three things as he descends now let's just go there you're with me first it's loneliness for I'll find it I'm glad this is not a funeral text hey is that there's a takes of life hallelujah amen he says this now before we say unto you this is first Thessalonians 4:15 for this we say unto you by the coming of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the first and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words but over times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness put yourself in that scripture but ye are not in darkness I mean that that they should overtake you as a thief here all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night they did a drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ I mean so he so he takes this any-any speech the rapture message and he says that now the Lord does three things as he is descending I mean first is the shout then the voice and the trumpet Jesus does all these three things when he's descending I mean first as a shout it's the message going forth I am in the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride hallelujah and in the second stage the voice of the Archangel now you take a natural harvest it's the condition of the wheat that tells the farmer that the harvest needs to happen right it's not the farmer just putting a date on the calendar saying well I think I'll harvest the field now no he goes out and looks at his field and when the field is all ready and mature not when it's half green and half golden when it's all golden when it's all ready then he says boys we're going to harvest this field hallelujah so now there's a the shout has come but this message is the shout hallelujah the shout as the mrs. brother Brahim says I mean and that is the living to bring forth the living bread to bring forth the living bride so it's a word that will produce the bride hallelujah cause it's the true interpretation of the scripture it is the Word of God amen and so now the second stage now is the voice of the Archangel which is the life of God comes into full maturity in a people amen when's the reps are going to go God looks down and says the field of the wheat is mature what was planted in the beginning has now been produced at the end Amen Jesus is on the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end it's what you see the beginning church dude and live hallelujah God living in the immense God appearing among them God manifesting himself and that manner it will appear at the end in the same manner because it's the same ones who at the beginning the same life as at the end hallelujah so now so the voice of the Archangel is the life of God in you hallelujah and that life comes to a maturity now I'll just say this what we think maturity is and what God sees can be two very different things because we look at our humanity and we beat ourselves up and say we're green as green can be we may not be that green hellooo yeah amen so we need to when God says we're ready then we're going Allu yeah the sunlight is shining we're in a harvest season the word is getting stronger the sunlights getting stronger I mean the sunlight always gets stronger and brighter as the harvest is coming closer the word has come open like never before hallelujah you're following me I trust you I trust when you read the scriptures listen to the message it grips you so much more than at first it means so much more to you now than it did when you first heard it I mean it's more richest more alive hallelujah means a lot more I mean you see Jesus Christ is more personal he's not an abstract bunch of theories but he's a living God oh yeah I trust he's that way to you well what's happening the sunlight is getting stronger I mean as the sunlight that produces the harvest hallelujah glory to God and so now the second part is now when the bride comes to full maturity then there's a the life and uses now harvest me I mean you look at the life that's on display in the wheat field what's it crying out crying out to the farmer I'm ready bring the combine I don't want to stay in this place take me to another place hallelujah hallelujah amen there's one granary there's one barn it says the wheat will be gathered into the barn hallelujah so there's a life in us saying come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus and not because the world's getting dark necessarily it will wax worse and worse we know that but the reason is is a life in us crying out I'm here to be taken I'm here I'm ready you have made me really hallelujah that's where we are isn't that wonderful we should rejoice I see we have a shirt Oken I'm just want I feel to go back to there just hammer it a little bit and then we ever short token if you have the Holy Ghost you're sealed into the kingdom it goes beyond emotion it will produce a motion Oh hallelujah emotion comes with it right but there's a problem is sometimes we see people shout and cry and scream and our experience can be different and we say well I need to have that but you may not need to have that because God is individual if he's made himself real to you he's changed your life and you can see that he is changing you what's that his life is coming forth but the devil always tries to make us think you need to have this kind of experience as your experience great enough when you get this great enough experience then you've really got it that's the devil lying to you are you with me amen because then we're because then we don't even realize what we even if we try and look at something that some pie-in-the-sky amen it's when the life comes in and changes you amen and your heart has turned completely all you want to do is serve the Lord amen yo when you meet God it doesn't mean every other desires turned off and you become a robot we're still in this flesh this flesh has desires this flesh wants to do a lot of things you follow me I hope this comes out the right way because this thing needs to be changed but just because this thing wants to be lazy and do nothing and whatever it doesn't mean I'm not a believer amen it's just this first nature that I still as in this flesh but if the Lord is in you then his life is greater than this but it depends what you yield yourself to amen it depends what you yield yourself to and brother BAM says even if you have the least desire to serve God he doesn't say the only desire he said the least desire so you can have the smallest desire but the and you could have other greater desires we said if you have just the least desire amen and that's all you need take that least desire right and serve God with it get the Holy Ghost with it God God had to equip us with something amen because we're in this age it's ten times harder right brother brahim says about how it's ten times harder for the young ones that it is my generation but yet pastors and mothers and fathers pray half the time as they used to who knows the quote so it's 10 times harder with half the help that's what he's saying so then how how can we ever overcome actually push her and be sealed in he gave us a desire you've got to see what he's given you to fight with right because sometimes we think well when I get the Holy Ghost and I'll be a Christian no you've got to take the desire you have and fight with that I mean it's just like a little baby eagle in the egg it has a desire I must push through I must push through this egg it doesn't know about flying it doesn't know what mama looks like it doesn't know what it's like to sweep down and catch its prey and make a nest and do all the Eagle things but it has a desire I've got to get out I don't like the signal more it's too restricting I want to live a greater life than just this one and attack centers are in a picks and a picture and a picks and a picks and then eventually pushes its head out maybe because I'm you know make the get bigger and it pushes that pushes out it flops out of the gig hallelujah it's free hallelujah amen glory you'll remember that time hallelujah as a glorious time baby you know you gotta take what you have that's why you know the devil always tries to make us think are we even saved amen are we even going to make it does he not take your emotions and you know spiritual realm and use it against you or is it just me okay I'm glad we're all common here please I'm glad that you can relate to me Allu yeah so he will take our emotions and beat us down with them you know one day we feel like you know like here we're shouting and rejoicing everything's going wonderful we think well I've arrived hallelujah and then you walk out those doors and the devil just goes like this and you think my how am I ever going to get there does that change your salvation doesn't change it one bit doesn't change it one iota I mean we're not saved because we feel it amen we're not saved we're not going in a rapture because we feel it we're going in a rapture and we know we're saved because we believe it I mean it's just like healing people get out of the wheelchair they got to keep believing and then yeah yeah brother I see is maybe if you can just wiggle your little toe just wiggle wet then wiggle your whole whole foot and then your leg and then stop hobbling start walking what's happening your faith is causing your body to come subject to your faith hallelujah our faith is here to dictate to this body amen this flesh is not here to have dominion over our souls I mean the Spirit in us is here to have dominion over the sky hallelujah so you know and he says but then if you start doubting what happens then you'll end up crippled again that's why you got to keep just keep believing you're healed as long as you believe it right you're saved as long as you believe it and can can can twist your thinking around that you think well where am I then what happens you're all you don't know where you are you following me remember you can be sealed I want to be fully maybe I'll just say this if you have the Holy Ghost you seal to the day of your redemption yep we can grieve from away that doesn't mean we're not sealed right but I don't want to live a life where I'm sealed unto the kingdom then the devil sucker punches me and I basically immobilize the rest of the walk you follow me I want to have the most effective walk amen I have one life to live one life to give why not run well amen and even if you trip it's not him that falls it's him that gets up those are the overcomers hallelujah he said I've been getting up a lot but it's always that one more time you get up it's always the one as long as the times getting up is one more than the time falling you're good hallelujah hallelujah but a mess amen as long as as long as it's one more okay we just got to keep pushing on he say well I don't know if I'll ever get there as I said he created the world's by his word he sent His Word to you you've received that word it's transformed you do you believe the word has effect in your life I trust it does I trust you believe it does and then you've received that word you see it's transforming power in your life he's not going to quit on you don't quit on him amen don't don't quit on him don't get frustrated at him he's not the author of frustration it's going to prove his salvation amen yes hallelujah now amen so he sees here so I think I read this last two Sundays ago so I could probably read it again it might be long enough they see the seed is not here with the shook now the same logos has a part he's got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tempered with as brooding over the church today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation amen and this is the age we're living in he's brooding over us that's why he moves among us because he wondered a full manifestation of his word not just a part of it but the fullness amen he says he says the bride knows where she stands I trust you know where you stand that's why saying we have a shirt oaken and brother and says it makes us so relaxed he say in this tension nervous H we can feel relaxed absolutely because if you keep your mind stayed upon him you shall have perfect peace what are you looking at he looking at your situation what's going on life are you looking at the token Amen that's why we shouldn't like I said Joe applied the token out of fear for his family he wasn't applying it out of faith he still applied it which was good but he's applying it out of fear he was sacrificing their behalf out of fear lest they've sinned right but we shouldn't apply the same faith that saved you you use it upon your children you use it upon your families amen you go after them in faith right that's how you apply the token create an atmosphere around you let me see they'll fall into it show us the world hallelujah but we should what are we focusing upon I mean this world is going to be a nervous neurotic stressed busy age we can't change it even if we move to some even if we made some commune or whatever more there will come a time where it becomes busy nervous stressed environment it may just change what it looks like but it'll still be that way why cuz it's the spirit in this world we can't we can't hide from it you go to Africa you go to Papua New Guinea you go anywhere it'll still be there they'll still be pressure amen but we have a place where we can lid off the pressure hallelujah there is a place where we can let off the pressure well we don't need to be worried about what's going on and then we the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe I mean that's why we need to gather as a body come into the atmosphere of God and lid off the pressure in the presence of the Lord hallelujah that's why we need to enter into his presence you can let off the pressure I mean and when you realize that you're sealed into that place we can lid off the pressure then you can rejoice we have a short token what does it mean you can be so it feels so relaxed does that mean you just kick your feet up and watch the world go by no now you have confidence what I have works I mean what I have will produce what are promises of will because remember it's not us being the Christian it's him in us amen don't leave the devil take your sincerity and beat you down with it I mean God gave you that sincerity God gave me that reverence and love for him don't let the devil beat you down with it hallelujah Amen you say Satan get behind me you want to kick him off your Mountain we put up with the devil too much we enter entertainers voice too much entertainers busyness and whatever it too much just kick them away say Satan get out of the name of Jesus Christ I'm not here to talk with you I'm here to have communion with my lord hallelujah darling the devil take your thoughts off some other place I mean that the visitation of God will you know pass you by say Satan get away go bother someone else holy I'm too busy business hours the closer and it's therefore opening again oh yeah so now we we know where we stand but give your faith for yourself brother man says use that same faith upon your family and don't worry about what they may be doing amen you know brother Graham said that the Apostle Paul he was Saul before he became Paul you know the Apostle Paul well saw when he when he consent you know he helped Stephen be stoned went to the high priest to get the papers to go to Damascus there was a man under conviction and and we would probably think how was that a man under conviction he hates he hates you Lord Jesus he's trying to destroy your people no brother Graham see that's a man under conviction he was convicted by the life he saw in Stephen he was under conviction of that and it stirred him up know sometimes we think men there's no way even the even the Apostle Paul said I bless feed but the thing is there's no way sometimes we think you know we would think of that was someone we think they're going in the other direction but there was God convicting them oh yeah and many times we pray for someone and they can end up going in the other way everything Lord how is this working out they're going in the opposite way that I'm asking you to take them but it's God dealing God is actually answering the prayer you say well that's that that seems contrary to what I'm thinking no you've got to have confidence we we walk by sight and not by faith is that right no I'm glad you're listening I send that opposite on purpose for once we walk by faith and not by sight right so we walk by faith and not by sight so we don't walk by what we see oh by what may be going on we walk by faith Allu yeah so that's why you don't look at what you see you're going to keep the promise before the Lord and walk by faith amen the bride knows where she stands in the life is in the grain again amen just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in the bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word that sucked up through these and came out here and came to a here here and all that life that came through here it's picked up its people and now it's forming into a head for the rapture he says that the invisible union she's saying that the life is in the grain again we're not going through a carrier stage of reformation but now is the restoration I mean of the end time hallelujah so the same life the same Jesus is now in Brad form it's the new hallelujah after 1963 I haven't found it but I do not find where brother around speaks about the appearing of of the Lord any more he speaks about the coming I mean it goes from he's appearing among us to his coming now we know when I read and so I read there in 1st Thessalonians 4 that that is the coming of the Lord or the cycle of the rapture Alleluia where he descends in three stages and then those three stages culminate and the dead in Christ raising us being changed to meet the Lord in the air so we will physically meet the Lord in the air I mean there is a physical meeting of hallelujah but then before that he comes down and he becomes one with us amen so now the bride is part of the coming of the Lord hallelujah we are part of the coming of the Lord where he comes his changes form now he's in bride form hallelujah you know hallelujah amen we are now living in this time which no longer just the appearing but it's is coming we're living in the coming of the Lord I mean we're the rapture is not just a split-second event but it's a process or a cycle and we are living in that time hallelujah you say well how do I am I going to make it if you love okay forgive me I don't hand out my glossary terms to begin with but when I speak about is appearing now and it's coming I'm thinking about the same thing right because we know that there's a crowd the Apostle Paul in our opening scripture he said there's a crown of life waiting for me and not me only but all those that love his appearing right and we are like we love his appearing his manifestation write the word appearing means manifestation speaking of a second Advent hallelujah so there's something in us when he comes down and identifies himself with a group of people we're not just caught up like the multitude with Jesus going into the city saying Hosanna and then a few days later Saint crucify them right we're not just caught up in what's going on but there's something in us saying that that we're identified with his word I learned that we love it when his word becomes flesh I mean that we don't just sympathize with it or say that's nice or whatever there's something in us saying that's me because God is wanting you to know you're identified with him I mean there's something in you that loves his word he's telling you you're identified with my word you are part of my word that's why you rejoice that's why you're happy that's why you lay lay down your life and say Lord take my whole life and make it 9 Alleluia he says and I've heard but now I see 1965 I should say not none of the rest them that's the shook that's on the weight that came out looked exactly like the wheat but there's no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that they organized they killed themselves that's where they died their stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's begin to form in the bride form I mean a God has to put on flesh in every generation here we are in this generation how you a Christian he is in you being the Christian amen if we say we have the Holy Ghost that's God in you Christ in you the hope of glory Alleluia now he sees here he sees but notice at the opening of the seven seals revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the Spirit of God and the full strength as he was here when he was on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things he did when he was on earth amen Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so now with the seals have come open the full word is born - manifestation amen what does that mean all that Jesus is we become by his grace I mean he became me that I might become him by grace Alleluia he sees in the seed is not here with the shook now forgive me for the ring we see is now in the elected church somewhere in the world that's pulling out and legs and sit aside from most things the manifestation of God has attracted its attention we're at the last days the shook has has give for that strengthen to the seed it's went out went on out it was a good shook it served its time see it is the word bride of the word groom hallelujah we're living at a friend's if he's come become one with you remember the Apostle Paul says in the book of Ephesians great is the mystery has been him wife becoming one flesh she speaks of Christ in His Church that's why he comes down identifies himself with you he's saying you are part of me your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life Alleluia I mean let's go to let's go to revelations 1 and 13 I just want to finish on this they will pick it up another time but let's go to let's go to revelations 1 in verse 13 now here here the here John the Revelator God begins to give him the the book of Revelation series of visions over about I think 3 years or however long it was and he says here in verse 13 he says oh let's let's go to verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the paps with a golden girdle and his head as hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes was the flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and a voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shone as forth in his strength now I want you to notice something now this is all symbolic the book of Revelation is a symbolic book now notice he says in verse 13 I saw one like unto the Son of Man okay know what this is actually showing is this is God in his bride through seven Church ages because husband and wife become one so when you see him you should see her right I mean when you see him you should see her because husband and wife are one Alleluia so it says one like unto the Son of Man a meant clothed with a garment down to the foot and the paps with a golden girdle and now notice the fittings birth like one like under the Son of Man one like him who was this his bride one like him watch how it was is from the seven churches clothed with a garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her own lujah has washed us from our sins with a I'm blood alright good about the Pepsi not a man a woman with a golden girdle the gospel that health the paps are here right the the gospel that held the power and glory of the of God over the body of Christ what a beautiful picture we've got here under consideration looking here down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle as here and as here as white as wool why does snow righteousness holiness white speaks of and his eyes like a flame of fire looks right through us says don't try to hide from him he knows who you are where you are what you've done yes so he sees everything oh god I just got a few minutes left to get this over to the church now notice his feet like fine brass brass as always judgment you know the brazen altar the brass serpent so forth brass speaks of judgment has feet in the Church of Jesus Christ is sit upon divine judgment Christ dying in our stead the just one paying our judgement up there before God and died there a sinner on the cross and a soul descended into hell and God not suffering his Holy One to see corruption raced him up on the third day for our justification who sits in his right hand now a high priest can be touched with the feeling around furmity which shall return in like manner as he went into heaven to receive a glorious church that he's made himself ready made herself ready blood wash sick and born I mean what a vision Amen alright like fine brass now watch and his feet like fine brass if they've been burned in a furnace all the dross has been taken out and he had his voice the voice of many waters now watches the church speaking to him now the voyeur waters revelation 1715 waters means thickness and multitudes of people now his voice or this being that is standing there looking like this Christ in his church as the bride and Christ being one like husband and wife as one Christ and and the church being molded together with one person the same Holy Spirit and the things that Christ did the church does also do you see it that beautiful church there in holiness and power and Majesty with seeing vision signs and wonders everything like he did here on earth giving all praise to God saying I can do nothing except the father shows me but as he showed me and here it is and they come see things that's go to go to taking place now Christ molded into one many people not just one voice of many waters it was the whole church the seven churches molded together as one great Ransome body of the Lord hallelujah was he saying it's saying one like unto the Son of man that is Christ in his bride walking through the seven Church ages hallelujah and that is us amen because if we're part of him right we're represented there with his holiness was as purity with the sinlessness I mean a sharp two-edged is still coming out of his mouth that's the Word of God that's in your mouth that's why you've got to speak to the enemy you're gonna speak to your storm Alleluia it's like just like with Elijah and Elijah the same you know Elijah's mantle fell on Elijah Elijah the type of Christ Elijah of the church the same so the same anointing that was on Jesus now comes upon the bride and the same ministry that Elijah had Elijah continued Allu you so the same ministry Jesus had the bride has continued down through seven Church ages amen and here we are it's not us it's not us doing that works it's him doing the works oh yeah hallelujah it's him living the life not us hallelujah it's his righteousness not our righteousness I mean I can even say it's his sincerity not our sincerity I mean it's his reverence not our reverence I mean because it's held him doing it it's him making us this way hallelujah I mean man can only do so much but man's right scissors but filthy rags on the side so it's nothing we can do it's him but we have to yield to his word we have to give ourselves to his word hallelujah that's the great you know humility real humility you know Jesus brother Barron speaks about you know there's been great Wars great warfare great weapons but God was going to show the human race how to fight a war it's very different not with bullets and guns and armies but in humility I mean he came the mighty Conqueror made flesh they said now I'm going to show you this is how you fight this is how you defeat the devil and it's not by great your great words and great marchers I'm a great strength that's by humility amen to be a real man you got to be humble hallelujah I meant to be a real believer you got to be humble he overcame by humility he subjected himself to the word that was lauded to him I mean it just as he you know um you know these the what sons of thunder your mum comes up to him you know make it that my sons that your left and right hand whatever and he asked the question can they be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized worth can I drink of the cup that I will drink off they said yes he said that's true but it's not given to me to where you gonna sit but he had a cup of suffering amen he had a cup of suffering right he suffered it is a man of suffering actually live for the bride not in terms of paying for redemption but God wants to bring out a character enough amen and so every time trouble comes up that's actually God giving you an opportunity amen you take I know brother on Spencer that spoke about it and the Easter convention 2009 he said about Beethoven Beethoven was a great composer but Beethoven one day began to lose his hearing that didn't mean he quit composing music he cut the legs off his piano he put it on the floor and he put his ear on the floor and he played and he began to write down he was losing his hearing he could be elite young that's how dear forgot but that hardship did not stop him expressing the gift in his life it didn't deter him he just had to make some changes I mean to overcome that what your his frailty in this human body amen I'll say this if a man I don't know what kind of faith Beethoven had but if a man just with a gift could give himself to that gift so much that he would rearrange you know he didn't quit something in him had to be expressed he couldn't stop it and had to float no matter how frustrated he died with his hearing Lee whatever more suffering in him said I must write this music I must compose this music and if a man may be a sinner I don't know but if he could do that back in that age just with a gift of music how much more the bride of Jesus Christ that had been redeemed they're being transformed by him I mean that's nothing should stop us no frustration no frustration nothing should stop us there should be something in here there must live a life that must come forth so don't let the devil ever try to discourage you or try and push you off the path I mean if the devil's trying to I'm getting a tech boy microphone if the devil if the devil's try to put you off the path that means you're on the path amen you know just like the disciples the country the government tried to make them stop it was state sanctioned religion and that pressure came upon them don't preach in his name don't use these terms of blood and Messiah and redemption don't speak of these things no more and they just stood there and there were simple people I think it's good to be simple person they say should we please yearn or shoot please God which one should we it's that simple and they decided well I'm just gonna please him and they were threatened and they see you know it's amazing Lazarus would have been there you know and no doubt they would say ok now brother Lazarus is going to give this testimony all these people who wonder what it's like on the other side he's a living witness that's been here and they got Lazarus yeah I'm just dramatizing but just to make it a bit more real yeah do you think you would have shared his testimony he was four days with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Daniel and and and Moses and King David and all these different ones he was having testimony meeting of testimony meeting hallelujah telling her how great he was and you know cuz they were all looking for him to come and this is just me but I love it you know everyone comes in because remember they were looking for the Messiah to come the one who comes into paradise that asked so what's what was going on in your day is he dear not yet not yet but he's he he's coming and then finally Lazarus comes in hallelujah where were you born Palestine what age listen listen this was he there here's their olya you know any cheer testimonies of what Jesus did me everything you know and no doubt I was there a different prophets of prophesied and would have been rejoicing because they're under the inspiration but now they see the inspirations being fulfilled that be rejoicing but then he heard a voice Lazarus come forth and our love is yeah I have to go his voice is calling me from this dimension into the next hallelujah hallelujah color and then and then the thief on the cross comes in hallelujah cuz member you know you know you take a relay race he's maybe four in the team how many Ounces of people are cheering them on it's their team I'm identified with them they're running for us hallelujah you know sometimes we get discouraged sometimes we think how we're going to make it and it's such a thin veil between this world and the next and a vacant if the Saints could just break in hallelujah let's say run take this word fulfill your part of the scripture you have the bend we can't run anymore we just gotta cheer you on and have you ever seen people running a relay the ones who have already run or running alongside the track with the runner saying run run run finish finish finish hallelujah and when the last one around they all begin to rejoice and tear curly and because they're cheering on the runner hallelujah there's so many more cheering for us friends holy all the church down through the ages saying ran little bride ran little bride you mean equipped around you mean equip the live this life you've been equipped at the word of living you run don't stop running keep your eyes on the prize we love his appearing why do we love him coming he's a crown Alleluia do you want that crown I want to put it at his feet I want to put his feet saying Lord you gave me victory you you cause me to overcome this life every work of the devil you put it on me I turned it down hello yeah Susan Sam's 27 when the enemy came against me he stumbled and fell hallelujah and and and and brother Brown took that psalmist the rapture opening in the rapture message speakers are those who hidden in the pavilion hallelujah hallelujah they saying so there was us when our folks came against us once upon a time we stumbled and fell Alleluia I was the devil's whipping boy for quite a few years but there came a time when the when God just said I'm done with this I can't let him go through this anymore now at my appointed season I'm going to meet him hallelujah and then that's when someone gets up hallelujah hello then that same enemy comes against you amen and you and he stumbles and falls you're not the Stumbler he stumbles and falls just like brother Graham said you let the enemy come against you a few times temptation comes gives you a few times you defeat it a few times watch your testimony blue pearl there that means the devil comes against you you kick him out he comes against you again you kick him out how they because if you think well we're back in that place right because he wants to you know it's just like a revolution you have a revolution do you think the government just quits it is bitter you take the French Revolution you take the Russian Revolution any revolution in history that's been bloody and Savage why because the people rise up the government just doesn't quit they turn all their guns against their own what they think is their own people but those people who rise up and not identified with their government no more there was a time when we were identified with the devil we loved his ways I'll be honest I la I loved in my fallen state because the human the fallen human nature is aligned with the devil that's why the world goes through towards his tricks and his nonsense is because our nature is a sin nature that we're born with but there comes a time when God comes in when you cry to him God changed my nature I don't want to just be prayed for I want to die out of that sin though I add to my son nature that I will be born again I'll be changed and have a different nature now you don't have this nature anymore so what's happening you've now risen up I will not let this one rule over me the word is now my head and do you think the devil just says well I'll quit that was fun with the next one no he gets his guns and he trains them on you he gets his armies out trying to suppress you whatever you gotta throw them off you say no no I've been liberated I'm free I'm not going back into bondage I'm not going back into our old system I'm under a new headship the Word of God hallelujah isn't that right and so now that's what the devil comes back against you because they know I'm free I'm under a new flag I'm gonna new it national anthem I've got a new passport not just a visa I'm a citizen Holly I'm a citizen of the kingdom of heaven I don't have a work visa or residency I'm a child a citizen of the kingdom hallelujah glory to God so we need to you know if the devil comes against us gotta kick them out you gotta kick them out I love we love his appearing so it doesn't matter what happens in this life doesn't matter what the devil and I'm trying to quit it doesn't matter what the devil puts against us the the Apostle Paul said no I have a crown that the righteous judge many times we think of a judges you're just gonna get penalized he's gonna be a guilty no it's like this the woman caught in adultery take him before the judge take him before the lawgiver I mean Jesus was the look everyone outside I just in a different form right so so here is the sheet they are pulling her in front of the one that gave the law he's full of grace and truth hallelujah and then now they say to him we caught this woman in adultery the very act will waste the man yeah the devil ways perverts the truth where is he I don't know where he is and then Jesus doesn't say anything but just begins to write in the sand you know we have a book of life maybe maybe he begin to write write their sins in the ground I don't know and he just said they you been without sin among you let him cast the first stone you know what happened there it was a judgment there was a judgment one party was found guilty and one party was found innocent and those scribes and Pharisees they did not expected that be the guilty ones hallelujah that's what the devil does he's made this world and he's made this face and he's and we're here and he's trying to bring us before God because God is a man of his word so if there's a penalty what good is a law without a penalty right so his word you know there are penalties in his word if you trespass it it's a man of his word so the devil knows if we won't just get these people to trespass the Word of God and unbelief then God has to judge them those dragged you here but now you have a book of life Allu you and the righteous judge by his blood wipes away all of your deeds all of your book your first book you know brother when he talks about the two books that are really just one is the book of life in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah and it's enough he starts writing in the sand there since the devil since Amen and then they all dropped their stones that I found guilty they convicted they go off and then he just says woman were thine accusers and she says his non-lawyer neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more what happened the one who thought she was going to be stoned was actually pardoned and the ones who are guilty I mean thought they were righteous were found guilty because there aren't since around the mouth is that okay and so sorry means how do you think of a judge you're so he's going to get penalty no no Jesus has actually called us not guilty not guilty and in his court we're not guilty we're pardoned and we're more than just no they didn't actually no actually no they found no he eradicated the evidence helllooo yeah there's no evidence held against the Bride of Christ the blood eradicate sit hallelujah so why we so the righteous judge is going to give us a crown why is he going to give it to us because he's judge us righteous because of what he did on our behalf Olu yeah and we just relax now we lid off the pressure can't we just be happy a man can't we just rejoice I loved his appearing the scribes and Pharisees didn't love his appearing they didn't love his coming they hated it you know when he came this sends actually were exposed amen but those who loved him were part of him they loved his coming they loved his appearance the woman of the world brother Roman says and I'll close with this the woman at the well brother Brahim said she had representation in heaven so when the Messiah came and spoke to her that brought her to life first she had representation in heaven the scribes and Pharisees all they had was their own human religious righteousness so when the light came and spoke to them it just black them out because they had no representation in heaven he speaks about in future home he said that one amen but you see her response to the word in her day showed she had representation in heaven how lujah that's the same thing with us hallelujah amen yes that's why we are the way we are because we have representation in heaven hallelujah and you can't change that representation it's either there or it's not and the reason we love is appearing we love and manifesting himself we love is coming we love his word that's because we have representation and heaven hallelujah glory we should be the most happiest people in all the world hallelujah and not because we just feel it the reason we feel it is because it's a reality we believe it so but the devil will come you walk out these doors come come Wednesday midday there'll be now a battle yo really a might you know I don't feel happy anymore don't go by how you happy you feel good by what you believe and if you focus on what you believe you'll become happy Allah Luke we're the musicians please this is finished
