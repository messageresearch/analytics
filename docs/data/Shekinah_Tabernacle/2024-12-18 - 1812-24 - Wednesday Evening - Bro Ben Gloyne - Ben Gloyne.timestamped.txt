[18:30] bless you friends you can have your
[18:31] seats tonight so I want to speak about
[18:33] uh I want to go through I love this
[18:35] portion of the scripture you know the um
[18:38] you know Mary going to to see Elizabeth
[18:41] and the wise men and all these things
[18:42] coming out you I enjoy this part of the
[18:44] gospel and uh but I want to uh Focus
[18:47] really on this verse here it says that
[18:49] you know for there shall be a
[18:50] performance of those things which are
[18:52] told her from the Lord this is verse 40
[18:57] um 45 to me this is a quite an
[18:59] astounding scripture where you look at
[19:00] Mary she was a woman of faith and um you
[19:03] know it's amazing when you think about
[19:05] how she didn't realize she was part of
[19:07] the prophecy of the you of a virgin
[19:09] shall conceive she didn't know that was
[19:11] her her name wasn't written in the
[19:13] scripture but we know when God uh
[19:15] inspired Isaiah to speak that word uh
[19:18] God knew that Mary was going to fulfill
[19:19] it amen it wasn't going to be anyone
[19:21] else it was going to be her and brother
[19:23] Braham would dramatize it in a few
[19:24] different ways but you know he would he
[19:26] would speak about how you know they
[19:27] would he and uh her fiance Joseph they
[19:30] would go to the synagogue and you know
[19:32] the you the priesthood get up to read
[19:33] and one day he uh you know seemed to be
[19:35] a bit of a different atmosphere in the
[19:36] synagogue as he stood up and he would he
[19:38] would he would open the scroll to Isaiah
[19:40] and he would read you know Isaiah 9 and
[19:43] verse6 you behold the Virgin shall
[19:44] conceive and you know there's something
[19:46] about when he spoke it it just seemed to
[19:48] really grip her uh maybe she had heard
[19:50] it many times before that maybe they
[19:52] read it out of tradition I do not know
[19:54] but you know there comes a time when the
[19:55] word becomes alive to us you know it
[19:57] becomes more than nice scripture more
[19:59] than a nice Instagram post or something
[20:01] like that but but the quotes and the
[20:03] scripture come alive to us because it's
[20:05] a season for them to be fulfilled in our
[20:07] lives and so she was she was a part of
[20:10] that prophecy and we're part of Prophecy
[20:11] too we're got to realize that we are a
[20:13] prophetic woman amen where where where
[20:15] Mary was a woman of Faith she was she
[20:17] was she was that you could say that
[20:19] elected lady as John would write to the
[20:21] church I think it's John 3 to the elect
[20:23] lady and I believe that we are part of
[20:26] that elect lady you know of the of the
[20:28] Bride of Jesus Christ has been gathered
[20:30] down through seven Church ages we're the
[20:32] last part of that body to come together
[20:34] sure there's more of us to come that's
[20:35] why we're here but you know we got to
[20:37] realize that you know we are a we are a
[20:39] prophetic lady am mean God thought of us
[20:41] before the foundation of the world and
[20:44] he knew the scripture we would fulfill
[20:46] and so she heard Isaiah 9 and6 so maybe
[20:49] you know Isaiah 7 you I'll I'll send you
[20:51] a super sign and maybe you know the you
[20:53] know the uh Rabbi would get up and he'd
[20:55] speak about the great Jehovah of the old
[20:57] days and you know how he was mighty with
[20:59] Moses and you know with Noah and you
[21:01] know Elijah and different prophets but
[21:03] then he but then he you know seemed to
[21:05] as he's building this platform about
[21:06] saying how great that Jehovah God was
[21:09] but then he kind of went sideways a bit
[21:10] and said isn't it so bad that same God
[21:13] he doesn't need to do those things
[21:14] anymore he doesn't need to do them uh
[21:16] miraculous anymore because we're here
[21:18] we've got our synagogues we got our
[21:19] traditions and we don't need that kind
[21:21] of a god anymore it just seemed to just
[21:23] kind of hit hit Mary like this and
[21:24] something didn't sound quite right to
[21:26] her because she had been taught from a
[21:28] young age that that Jehovah God is the
[21:30] same yesterday today and forever and
[21:32] that so you know and and um so when they
[21:35] went home you know brother Brown would
[21:36] say that you know um you know her and
[21:38] Joseph and you after the after the
[21:40] service there they would gather and they
[21:42] would open the Scrolls and you know they
[21:44] would talk about what the what the rabbi
[21:46] said and you know there just something
[21:47] how she your eyes just lit up where you
[21:49] said Joseph can you find that scripture
[21:51] in the Scrolls so Isaiah 9 and6 you know
[21:53] and maybe you know he'd go get the
[21:55] scroll and open it and we know it wasn't
[21:57] numbered like we have it now but he
[21:58] found it he would read that and be like
[22:01] when he read that just an anointing
[22:02] would come down into the room now I'm
[22:03] just dramatizing these things because we
[22:05] to realize the same God back there does
[22:07] the same things today who's ever had
[22:09] that when you open the word it's just to
[22:10] a particular promise and it seems to
[22:12] speak to your heart then you maybe speak
[22:13] it you read it it's like the atmosphere
[22:15] just becomes different God draws near to
[22:18] you who's had that kind of experience
[22:20] right so there was something so electric
[22:22] about this event it was different to
[22:25] maybe when they read it before and and
[22:27] uh you know then um then then um you
[22:29] know there was a time when she would uh
[22:30] she would maybe the next morning she
[22:31] would go down to the well you know you
[22:34] early in the morning you the well she
[22:35] always went to to get their uh you know
[22:37] water for the for the day they didn't
[22:39] have running water in those days they'd
[22:41] go to the well and you know she was
[22:42] walking there and then she saw this kind
[22:44] and she was thinking about that
[22:45] scripture Behold a virgin shall conceive
[22:48] and think about how Messiah is going to
[22:50] come and she's just pondering on those
[22:52] things if you want the Lord Jesus to
[22:54] draw near to you think on his word think
[22:57] on his prophet promises irrespective of
[22:59] how you feel what day you're going
[23:01] through think on his promises to you
[23:04] every promise in the word is ours okay
[23:06] begin to think on his promises and how
[23:08] he's so the same and he's present amen
[23:11] he's here to help and he's here to
[23:12] fulfill his word she was thinking about
[23:14] those things and suddenly a light
[23:15] flashed around her and you know she she
[23:17] she saw a man seem to appear you know
[23:20] it's amazing no one else was there to uh
[23:23] to to Bear record of this one testimony
[23:26] of a teenage girl our whole really
[23:29] Christianity hinges on that because if
[23:31] he wasn't the Virgin born son of God who
[23:33] are we following we're just following a
[23:35] Jew but we ain't saved by Jewish blood
[23:37] or Gentile blood we're saved by the
[23:39] blood of God and then so that angel you
[23:41] know Gabriel said to her said Hail Mary
[23:43] and you know she would have stopped and
[23:44] you would have realized how does this
[23:46] man know my name and there's a different
[23:47] atmosphere around him and you know then
[23:49] then then then she would you um he he
[23:51] would say to her rather you know you're
[23:53] highly favored of God you're going to
[23:55] have the promised Messiah and you know
[23:57] you know she was taken back by the this
[23:58] because she was remember she had heard
[24:00] the scripture not long before and it
[24:02] gripped her heart and now the
[24:03] Fulfillment was coming into
[24:05] manifestation and um you know you know
[24:07] she said how can this be I you know I'm
[24:09] not even married and you know she but he
[24:11] said to her the Holy Ghost will come
[24:13] upon thee and you'll have the you'll
[24:15] have the Messiah and something in her
[24:17] said I agree with that amen she didn't
[24:20] work it out she didn't she didn't wait
[24:22] for a detailed explanation something in
[24:24] her said yes and there's something about
[24:27] you and I it's not Humanity that says
[24:29] yes to the word it's not our it's not
[24:31] how smart we are it's not based on our
[24:33] nature our personality there's something
[24:35] in us just says yes you can be having
[24:38] the worst day of your life and something
[24:39] in you says yes CU it's deeper than your
[24:42] spirit it's deeper than your M your
[24:44] flesh it's your soul that says yes to
[24:46] the word amen so there she is and she
[24:49] says yes be it unto me according to Thy
[24:52] word now we know six months before
[24:55] this the same G uh the same Gabriel
[24:58] visited Zachariah in the in the
[25:01] temple and we know the story he was he
[25:03] was um struck dumb because he didn't
[25:05] believe the he didn't believe the
[25:07] message of the Angel but yet God still
[25:11] fulfilled his word and then and then
[25:13] here we come down to the scene where
[25:16] where where Mary has has has um gone and
[25:18] she's you know it's amazing testimonies
[25:21] it's amazing the
[25:23] opposition that someone with a testimony
[25:25] receives who's had that kind of
[25:27] experience you think the whole world's
[25:29] because you got to think about it if we
[25:31] go back 2,000 years ago the the whole
[25:34] promise of the Ages was coming into
[25:36] manifestation for the Jewish people and
[25:38] for the world the Messiah was coming
[25:40] more than a prophet more than a teacher
[25:43] more than some great king it was the
[25:45] King of Kings was coming to the Earth
[25:47] and you would think that you know
[25:48] everyone would rally around her and be
[25:50] so supportive and so excited because God
[25:53] had sent an angel and promised her
[25:55] you're the Fulfillment of the scripture
[25:57] but yet even Joseph was struck by it he
[26:00] would you know you know just really
[26:01] knocked him back cuz he thought how
[26:03] could this be it's you know because it's
[26:04] not natural it's not natural for these
[26:07] things you know he was a just man the
[26:09] Bible says he was going to put her away
[26:11] privately because he was afraid well you
[26:13] know I don't want to see her stoned and
[26:14] you know I love her and all these
[26:16] emotions going on and trouble and it's
[26:18] amazing in those kind of circumstances
[26:20] that's when God can draw
[26:21] near amen because no doubt he went to
[26:24] praying in his heart he didn't
[26:26] understand this his fiance turns up and
[26:27] she's got this light in her eyes or
[26:29] something's different about her and you
[26:31] know he you know she began to testify to
[26:33] him you know how we read that scripture
[26:35] the other
[26:36] day an angel visited
[26:38] me and he couldn't because it was so
[26:41] foreign to what he was used to he was
[26:43] used to hearing a god of the past but
[26:45] now he was in the present and now he was
[26:47] you know fulfilling his word in in his
[26:50] own life and then so Joseph was troubled
[26:52] by this and you know and then of course
[26:54] you know the angel came to him in a
[26:56] dream God uh uh you can say protected a
[26:59] son in a secondary Way by a dream and uh
[27:01] you know you know the angel sent him you
[27:03] know fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
[27:05] wife cuz the baby within her is of the
[27:07] Holy Ghost right but then now but then
[27:09] you know no doubt that you know that
[27:10] name of being an illegitimately born son
[27:14] followed him all the days of his life
[27:16] and there was a dark mark against her
[27:18] because people did not understand the
[27:19] visitation of God but to me it's amazing
[27:22] how how how here in verse um sorry if I
[27:25] can find it again verse 45 says blessed
[27:27] is he that believeth for there shall be
[27:29] a performance of those things which were
[27:30] told her from the Lord I think for for
[27:33] anyone to stand and to hear those words
[27:36] she needed to hear those words she
[27:38] really needed to hear those words that
[27:40] God is going to perform that which he
[27:42] promised I mean because she was going to
[27:44] come up against the greatest probably
[27:46] opposition one person with a testimony
[27:48] would ever face because remember this is
[27:51] Messiah coming there more than a prophet
[27:53] so she would have you know had a lot of
[27:55] backlash a lot of people talking about
[27:57] her and all trying to make her doubt the
[27:59] word and all these things but but she
[28:01] was told that God's going to perform
[28:03] this I say God is going to perform this
[28:05] message God is going to fulfill this
[28:07] message that the Rapture is going to
[28:09] take place amen God is going to fulfill
[28:11] it in our lives not just anyone but in
[28:14] your life I mean because remember when
[28:16] God quickens his word to you what is he
[28:18] doing he is giving you the confidence
[28:21] that he's going to perform that which he
[28:23] has promised doesn't matter how
[28:25] impossible it seems doesn't matter how
[28:27] far away it may be I know I'm yeah I'm
[28:29] speaking very broadly here cuz we're
[28:31] going through a lot of different things
[28:32] as families as you know situations right
[28:35] but you got to realize but but make it
[28:37] personal as I'm speaking right that
[28:39] whatever the Lord has promised he will
[28:41] perform it right remember this is not us
[28:44] taking ourselves into a Rapture this is
[28:46] God guiding us like he guided Mary and
[28:49] Joseph he guided them and it's amazing
[28:51] how he guided them through great
[28:53] difficulties there she is n months
[28:55] pregnant they're living in the wrong
[28:57] City
[28:58] he had to be M he had to be born in
[29:00] Bethlehem he could not be born in
[29:03] Nazareth or wherever they were right he
[29:06] could not be born there because that
[29:08] would break the prophecy the prophecy
[29:10] was out of Bethlehem would he come the
[29:12] house of God's bread right Bethlehem
[29:14] means House of God's bread so so you
[29:17] know God God inspired a cruel Emperor to
[29:21] put economic pressure on the people to
[29:24] cause them to move to to where the word
[29:27] could be fulfilled
[29:28] and you know no doubt you know there she
[29:30] is she's 9 months pregnant it's very
[29:32] uncomfortable it's uncomfortable to
[29:33] watch because you feel so sorry for them
[29:37] I'm sure there's okay good there's some
[29:38] husbands here have some heart good
[29:40] praise the Lord but you see you know
[29:41] because you feel so sorry and you can't
[29:43] help them you can't you know you know
[29:45] but you so so imagine now you're going
[29:47] to put your nine uh so your wife who's
[29:49] pregnant nine months she's duw any day
[29:51] on the back of a donkey not on the in
[29:54] the back of a car not so I'm comfortable
[29:56] right it's going to be a donkey it's
[29:57] going to be on gravel or dirt roads dirt
[30:00] tracks whatever it ain't comfortable so
[30:03] no doubt he's going through he's real
[30:05] anxious about it and he feels so bad
[30:08] sorry honey we have to go why do we have
[30:11] to go because this cruel Emperor maybe
[30:13] he's breathing under his breath saying
[30:15] man that guy and Jehovah God deal with
[30:17] him and you know he's getting so mad
[30:19] this taxation so unjust and all the
[30:21] economy of our day and how dare he do
[30:23] this to us and God if you really cared
[30:25] you would alleviate this pressure but
[30:28] God caused the pressure cuz he had to
[30:29] move his children to the right place for
[30:32] the word to be fulfilled for the
[30:33] prophecy to be fulfilled so really when
[30:35] this world is falling apart we say thank
[30:37] you God you're moving us into a position
[30:40] into a spiritual condition I mean for
[30:43] the word to be fulfilled in our lives
[30:45] not just in anyone's life in your life
[30:47] praise the Lord so we got to realize
[30:49] that everything is working for our good
[30:52] amen you got to realize we're living in
[30:54] an exodus season right we're living in
[30:56] the Third Exodus the first Exodus was
[30:58] out of Egypt they did not like being in
[31:02] Egypt they were sure they lived in Goan
[31:05] right they lived in the best part of
[31:06] Egypt but God allowed the screws to get
[31:09] tightened that they would cry out God
[31:11] get us out of this place amen and to me
[31:14] that's why the world is falling apart
[31:17] that we don't get too comfortable down
[31:18] here with our first world problems and
[31:21] everything right but there's a reason
[31:23] why things get tough because Lord when
[31:25] are you going to get us out of here amen
[31:28] God doesn't want us comfortable down
[31:30] here sure he wants us comfortable for a
[31:31] sense but in terms of we should have a
[31:33] desire Lord I want to be where you
[31:35] are amen and really I guess to be fair
[31:38] the the pull should be greater of Lord I
[31:41] want to see you than more than the
[31:42] world's getting bad but I hope you
[31:44] understand God allows it to get
[31:45] uncomfortable because we are getting
[31:47] ready to
[31:48] leave so there they are they go to
[31:51] Bethlehem there's um actually let's just
[31:54] I'm just going to drop a Way Big sigue
[31:56] in here because I want to go into some
[31:57] things let's go to Psalms
[32:00] 19
[32:01] um we're going to go to Psalms
[32:04] 19 and we're going to read
[32:08] from uh verse
[32:11] 8 but it's more verse 12 I want to
[32:14] really capture here
[32:16] because when the word is fulfilled what
[32:19] is in someone comes
[32:21] out
[32:23] right you know as are we there Psalms 19
[32:27] and verse 7 says the law Oh wait we're
[32:29] turning I'm hearing some rustling of
[32:31] pages good on
[32:33] you okay um it says here the law so I'm
[32:36] in verse yeah verse S thank you the law
[32:38] of the Lord is perfect converting the
[32:40] soul the testimony of the Lord is sure
[32:41] making wise the simple the statutes of
[32:44] the Lord are right rejoicing the heart
[32:45] the Commandment of the Lord is pure
[32:48] enlightening the eyes the fear of the
[32:49] Lord is clean enduring forever the
[32:52] judgments of the Lord are true and
[32:53] righteous alt together more to be
[32:55] desired are they than gold yay then much
[32:58] fine gold sweeter also than the honey
[33:00] and the honeycomb moreover by them is
[33:03] thy servant warned and in keeping of
[33:05] them there is great reward who can
[33:07] understand his errors cleanse thou me
[33:09] from Secret faults keep back thy servant
[33:12] uh also from presumptuous sins least
[33:15] them uh sorry let them not have dominion
[33:17] over me then shall I be upright and I
[33:20] shall be innocent from the great
[33:23] transgression now I dropped this in here
[33:25] because Mary and Joseph went to
[33:27] Bethlehem David was born so so the man
[33:30] who was inspired to write this was David
[33:32] he was born in Bethlehem now he was a
[33:34] man after God's Own Heart we know that
[33:37] right he was quick to repent when he was
[33:39] wrong he acknowledged he was wrong you
[33:41] know whenever God came his way it
[33:43] brought him back to God you know when he
[33:45] went you know trouble and sideways and
[33:46] all these things he had a heart but but
[33:48] see his cry was Lord cleanse thou me
[33:52] from Secret faults Now secret faults is
[33:55] something you're not aware of it's like
[33:57] you know like a has got you ever seen a
[33:59] horse with blinkers on it like this
[34:00] right and it you know it can't see where
[34:02] it would normally see cuz it's got
[34:04] something obscuring its Vision so it's
[34:07] unaware of things it can't see and it's
[34:09] like things in our nature it's like we
[34:12] got blinkers right there's secret faults
[34:14] so they may be very obvious to someone
[34:16] else but to us it's like what do you
[34:18] mean I'm like that cuz it's it's in a
[34:21] blind spot right but do you see but the
[34:24] Lord now the Lord has an ability
[34:28] to take the blinkers off right and we
[34:31] know God deals with us little by little
[34:34] you know like he said to the children of
[34:35] Israel when they when they first came
[34:37] out of Egypt you know they had to go a
[34:38] certain way kind of like the long way
[34:40] around because otherwise they come
[34:42] straighted towards the enemy and the
[34:44] battle will be too hard for them they
[34:45] get discouraged so God let them come
[34:48] little by little because to be fair if
[34:51] God dealt with me in completeness you
[34:53] know completeness in one moment would be
[34:55] too much in terms of the things that you
[34:56] know God's got to deal with right sure
[34:59] we make a full surrender but then God
[35:01] begins to do surgery in our lives right
[35:03] he begins to mature us and mold us and
[35:05] reveal things like we're like an onion
[35:07] right deep-seated things get taken out
[35:08] and you know every God deals with us in
[35:11] Seasons who's with me tonight you
[35:13] understand right amen so now so David
[35:15] saying cleanse thou me from my secret
[35:17] fault so David recognized that there
[35:19] were things that he did or things in his
[35:22] in his his human spirit that he was not
[35:24] aware with there but because he was he
[35:27] was God's child he had a desire Lord
[35:30] whatever is in me cleanse it from me
[35:33] just like brother Isaac's you know last
[35:35] few Wednesdays ago he said about how
[35:37] there's an amalaki will rais up in your
[35:38] spirit but it's only when it raised up
[35:40] then you kill the thing so that's a
[35:42] secret fold that can hide but then in
[35:44] moments it'll raise its head what are
[35:47] you going to do with it then right so so
[35:50] this is this is how David would David
[35:52] would um you know he would approach God
[35:54] this way Lord cleanse me from my secret
[35:56] faults and and so now here Mary and
[35:58] Joseph they come to they come to the the
[36:01] same place David was born now I trust
[36:02] this kind of ties them together because
[36:05] as I said a few moments ago it's amazing
[36:07] what happens when the word is fulfilled
[36:09] now if you look at the scribes and
[36:11] Pharisees you know they would have no
[36:12] doubt devoted well they did devote their
[36:14] entire lives to studying the prophecies
[36:16] Jesus fulfilled right and it was no
[36:20] there was no uh it didn't bring anything
[36:22] out of them when they debated it of
[36:25] really their true self and what needed
[36:26] to be cleansed from them right they
[36:29] could sit there they could argue they
[36:30] could fuss they could stand up they
[36:32] could write phds and you know thesises
[36:34] and thesis defenses and all those things
[36:36] could go on but it but it's when that
[36:38] word that they were arguing about got
[36:40] fulfilled it really brought out faults
[36:42] in them now it would say in first John
[36:46] here that there's um wait sorry I just
[36:49] got to unlock this phone here so F so
[36:51] first John we're coming back to Mary and
[36:54] and and and Joseph right but 1 John 2:16
[36:58] he says for all that is in the world the
[36:59] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[37:01] and the pride of life is not of the
[37:03] father but it is of the world says three
[37:05] things lust of the flesh lust of the
[37:07] eyes and the pride of life and
[37:09] everything that deals well you know we
[37:11] wrestle with in this life is part of
[37:13] those three in those three categories
[37:15] they will fall into one of them and so
[37:18] now with the scribes and Pharisees now
[37:20] you got to look at now brother BR brings
[37:22] it out very nicely if you listen to Why
[37:24] had to be Shepherds or why little
[37:25] Bethlehem different things he would
[37:27] speak about how Jesus was the Lamb of
[37:29] God so of course he was born in a stable
[37:32] right because Lambs are born in Stables
[37:35] right so the nature of of the Lord had
[37:37] to match the place he was born in okay
[37:40] and and and and he had to and the angels
[37:43] did not go to the high priest didn't go
[37:45] to Jerusalem when Jesus was born but
[37:48] they went to Shepherds on the
[37:50] hillside they went to the ignorant
[37:53] unlearned you know uneducated no bodies
[37:56] of Israel and that's where the Angels
[37:59] declared to them uh to to to human
[38:02] beings messiah's on Earth right now now
[38:05] the reason is is because now the
[38:07] Shepherds didn't know it but their true
[38:09] nature matched who Messiah was right
[38:13] their true nature matched who Messiah
[38:15] was he you know like brother B says
[38:17] could you imagine some high priest
[38:19] dignitary with a pig on his nose like
[38:21] tiptoeing into the manger cuz it's stunk
[38:23] of animals and the animals are doing all
[38:25] kinds of things and who's been in a
[38:29] oh man there's a RoR upon AR RoR upon
[38:31] Aroma and all kind of things can you
[38:33] imagine some dignitary going into that
[38:36] kind of place to see Messiah would they
[38:38] humble themselves to the word being
[38:40] fulfilled in their midst absolutely not
[38:43] they had a secret fault of Pride right
[38:46] they had a secret fault of Pride they
[38:48] could debate about Messiah and how he'd
[38:50] be born and where and all those things
[38:52] but when the word came into fulfillment
[38:54] in their day could they could they be
[38:56] identified with it and absolutely not
[38:58] because it didn't match who they were
[39:01] you see and they weren't willing when
[39:03] Jesus said plainly I am my father or one
[39:06] they didn't say I thought so I'm so glad
[39:09] you told us that Lord Jesus you are
[39:11] Messiah no they could not because their
[39:13] secret fault was their pride and I doubt
[39:15] very much they thought they were
[39:17] prideful what do you mean that we are
[39:19] full of arrogance and all these things
[39:21] we're the religious people of the day we
[39:23] have devoted our entire lives to
[39:25] studying the message
[39:27] we've given our lives look at who you
[39:29] know look at what we've done for we do
[39:31] this for the
[39:32] people but it was
[39:34] Pride are you following right you see it
[39:37] was a secret see but you see the word
[39:39] actually exposed their pride and they
[39:42] weren't willing see the blinker came off
[39:44] but they said no that should be there
[39:46] and you're wrong you see and so and so
[39:49] they weren't willing to give themselves
[39:52] to be identified with some Shepherds now
[39:55] what I love about the Shepherds and the
[39:57] even the Magi see it goes to show it
[39:59] doesn't you know it doesn't matter how
[40:01] rich or poor someone is are they willing
[40:04] to Humble themselves and give themselves
[40:07] to where Messiah is the word you see
[40:10] it's like the Magi they brought gold
[40:12] frankincense and myrrh because they
[40:13] identified as as brother Aman brought
[40:15] out that Jesus was deity gold in the
[40:18] flesh put into service to die right gold
[40:22] deity frankincense is in service mrr is
[40:24] a burial spice so deity would be put in
[40:27] flesh to die for the for for mankind
[40:30] right so they gave the gifts
[40:32] acknowledging what was within him right
[40:35] just like the mighty men with David they
[40:37] knew he was coming into power right they
[40:39] so they realized you're going to be king
[40:41] so they gave themselves to him but you
[40:44] see
[40:46] now others could not identify him at all
[40:49] that way no doubt when the Shepherds
[40:51] they came into Bethlehem isn't it
[40:53] amazing it doesn't say anywhere that the
[40:55] whole city went to the manger
[40:58] but yet the Shepherds broadcasted it
[41:00] everywhere they came in by night now
[41:02] normally everyone's asleep right here
[41:04] they come in that maybe the first manger
[41:07] they went to I don't know there would
[41:08] have been more than one manger probably
[41:09] in Bethlehem but eventually they found
[41:11] it right or the Lord LED them there of
[41:13] course and then once they had met the
[41:16] Messiah that Messiah was upon Earth that
[41:19] the Angel's message was true then they
[41:21] went out of there they would have been
[41:22] screaming at the top of their lungs come
[41:24] see Messiah amen come see the word
[41:27] fulfilled come see God is not a god of
[41:30] History he's in flesh today right in
[41:32] your city they would have just they
[41:34] would have been screaming dancing they
[41:36] would have been elated but no one else
[41:38] seemed to it didn't say the city went
[41:41] there after that they just went back to
[41:42] the back to their sheep you see and then
[41:45] and then when the then when the um wise
[41:48] men of course they thought well he'll be
[41:50] in Jerusalem surely it's the capital So
[41:52] eventually they get there and the
[41:53] doesn't say anything about the star
[41:55] being seen when they went to Jerusalem
[41:56] showing the the religious confusion of
[41:58] that place just obscured where the light
[42:00] was and they go to Herod and herod's
[42:02] like all puzzled by it and of course he
[42:04] has a murderous intent and you know he's
[42:06] not willing to lay that aside and say
[42:08] Here's Messiah and you know I'm going to
[42:10] come with you at all these things and
[42:12] then so of course you know the um wise
[42:14] men had to be warned in a dream after
[42:16] they found Messiah after they followed
[42:18] the Angel's message because remember if
[42:20] this message has not LED you to Christ
[42:23] yet remember the message is Christ by
[42:25] the way you'll see Jesus Christ is the
[42:27] the message right but if you only see a
[42:30] prophet you haven't seen it right it's
[42:32] just like the wise men if they just saw
[42:33] a star they hadn't seen it they had not
[42:35] gone all the way to have a personal
[42:37] meeting with Messiah upon the Earth as
[42:39] the same thing with this word if you can
[42:41] see it's Jesus Christ nothing will shake
[42:43] you from it nothing will move you from
[42:45] it when you see it's Messiah revealed
[42:47] because the the word has always been
[42:49] Messiah and every generation the word
[42:52] revealed as Messiah he say well I'd love
[42:54] to go back 2,000 years ago and see Jesus
[42:56] youo In the Flesh that would be amazing
[42:58] but the same one is is his word today
[43:01] the same one walks in our midst every
[43:04] day the same one walks with you like he
[43:05] does the two on the way to M he walks
[43:07] with you that's in you even better than
[43:09] being in his body if I say it that way
[43:11] because he's in you right but you see
[43:14] now there's many times that we have
[43:16] these now the word comes and and I'm
[43:19] actually going to wrap this up soon but
[43:21] we have secret
[43:23] faults but then the thing is we read
[43:25] psalms 19 just like see it's very e say
[43:29] God come and do something for me but
[43:31] then he uses his
[43:33] body the Angels Came to the Shepherds
[43:36] then the Shepherds had the message They
[43:37] Carried the message into the City and
[43:39] carried it out they carried it in by
[43:41] saying where is he we've heard the
[43:42] angels then they left the angel saying
[43:44] the Angel's message was right he's right
[43:46] here and no doubt there would have been
[43:48] a cry because there was such a burden of
[43:50] the Romans upon the Israelite population
[43:52] and they were crying out Lord when will
[43:54] you send us a deliverer when will you
[43:56] fulfill the words of Isaiah and it was
[43:58] happening right in their midst you see
[44:00] so God works through his body so now we
[44:03] read psalms 19 we say Lord cleanse me my
[44:05] secret faults and then God happens to
[44:07] anoint one of his members and speaks to
[44:11] you right it may be Pride it may be
[44:16] stubbornness it may be a you know not
[44:19] willing to you know stubbornness can be
[44:21] a secret fault he said I'm not
[44:24] stubborn remember the Bible says
[44:26] everyone is right in their own eyes I'm
[44:28] putting myself in this too by the way
[44:31] okay I'll be honest I think I'm right
[44:33] and I've said it before over the years I
[44:34] think I'm right because the Bible says
[44:36] everyone is right in their own eyes we'd
[44:39] be lying if we say oh no I'm not right
[44:41] no I think I'm right okay but we all
[44:43] have secret faults we all have
[44:46] characteristics in our spirit that we
[44:48] don't realize are there but they affect
[44:51] people maybe it's indifference maybe
[44:54] it's Pride maybe it's just being too
[44:56] blunt honest but it's in a hurtful
[44:58] condescending way you know saying things
[45:00] you don't even need to speak about
[45:02] against people I got so annoyed at you
[45:04] that I what did I do oh nothing I was
[45:06] just thinking something well how does
[45:07] that help me I'm just throwing out an
[45:10] example but you know what I mean people
[45:11] come and say things like that it's like
[45:13] sorry for being here I don't know how
[45:15] you know what's my response I'm not sure
[45:17] but you see they've got secret faults
[45:19] you know they've got this thing and then
[45:21] if you talk to them about it are they
[45:24] willing to take the blinker down and say
[45:27] yes Lord take that from me because we're
[45:30] you know I'm looking at a group of
[45:31] sincere
[45:32] people amen I'm looking at people who
[45:35] want to be right with God more than
[45:36] anything yeah so now if we read the
[45:39] Psalms 19 we say Lord cleanse me of my
[45:42] secret faults God will actually allow
[45:44] for that secret fault to come to light
[45:45] in your
[45:46] life and it'll be through every day iron
[45:49] sharpens iron kind of a deal amen you
[45:52] say well you know I just like to dig on
[45:55] people are you sure that's what you
[45:56] should be doing I've got to tell them
[45:59] are you sure that's what you should be
[46:01] doing do you feel do you oh I can see
[46:04] what's wrong with that see being a
[46:06] perceiver and being critical are very
[46:09] much people mistake it anyone can be
[46:14] critical but a perceiver if you really
[46:16] perceive something one you will pray for
[46:19] that person more than anything but two
[46:21] you'll see a way out for
[46:23] them right being critical oh that's just
[46:25] wrong okay
[46:27] thanks that Pro person probably knows
[46:30] that but you see oh well but I've got to
[46:33] tell them and this is just how it is
[46:34] does it help them at
[46:36] all we're not gravediggers people we're
[46:40] not here to push people down holes like
[46:42] take Jeremiah like he got put down the
[46:43] well that was empty and he's just
[46:45] wallowing in the mire in the bottom you
[46:46] know we're not here to do that to one
[46:49] another you know we're not here to do
[46:51] that to one another we here to lift one
[46:52] another up and if you've got a problem
[46:54] with someone you should be praying you
[46:56] know probably really the first question
[46:57] we should ask each other is are we
[46:59] praying for that individual I'm not
[47:00] talking to anyone specifically okay this
[47:03] is just how this is just it's Christmas
[47:07] time but you know do you pray for that
[47:09] individual do you really care enough
[47:11] about them to lift them before the
[47:13] Throne of
[47:14] God well no cuz I have discernment are
[47:17] you sure about that but you see that can
[47:20] be a secret fault where people are just
[47:21] so you know and sure you say well kiwi's
[47:24] have a problem about not being direct
[47:26] enough
[47:27] possibly but the thing is when someone
[47:29] comes to you and tells you something it
[47:31] can be your worst enemy but can you
[47:33] actually take the truth they're giving
[47:35] you a donkey spoke to balum he took what
[47:39] the donkey was saying balum had some
[47:42] sense he was a false prophet you know he
[47:44] was way off doing his own thing but yet
[47:47] he didn't discard what the donkey was
[47:48] saying he just took what the donkey
[47:51] said right can you now we ain't donkeys
[47:57] right but even if someone says something
[47:59] in a critical manner to you can you just
[48:01] take that
[48:02] statement take the emotion out of it of
[48:04] you the bars they're throwing and say
[48:07] well what does what value does it hold
[48:09] for
[48:10] me can we yeah I think it's important
[48:13] you know because otherwise what happens
[48:14] if we we just hit it for six and that
[48:17] one statement could change our
[48:19] lives it could change us for the that
[48:21] could be actually
[48:23] God speaking to you
[48:27] you know it's like Elijah you know Ahab
[48:29] Ahab uh is told well Elijah um reveals
[48:33] himself to Ahab during the drought you
[48:36] know Elijah said you Ahab says to Elijah
[48:38] you're the one who brought this problem
[48:40] on Israel of the drought and Elijah says
[48:42] no you're the one what if Ahab actually
[48:46] took on board what Elijah said to him
[48:48] here is his enemy how do you think
[48:51] ahab's life would have been in the
[48:52] palace with Jezebel because because
[48:54] Elijah was alive
[48:58] it would not have been a comfortable
[49:00] place to live well when you're living
[49:02] with jizel you got a lot of problems
[49:03] okay but two her enemy and sadly your
[49:08] enemy is Alive and Well somewhere and it
[49:10] would have been like a been like a be
[49:12] under her Bonnet a whole a whole Hive
[49:14] under her Bonnet she would have been so
[49:16] mad this guy's still alive and why
[49:18] didn't you get him and it would have
[49:19] been weeks and months of why didn't your
[49:21] guards do something your soldiers are
[49:22] useless and you know so finally he's
[49:25] there and Ahab said finally I've got my
[49:27] moment you've caused all this trouble
[49:29] remember ahab's got big blinkers he's
[49:32] got big secret faults and to him because
[49:35] he thinks he's doing right because
[49:37] everyone in their own eyes is right
[49:40] right so he thinks but to us it's
[49:42] obvious Ahab your lukewarm your backslid
[49:44] you've compromised on the word that's
[49:46] obvious to us right but to him he
[49:48] thought he was doing the right thing
[49:49] otherwise he would have done something
[49:50] else and people think they're doing the
[49:53] right thing okay so then why didn't
[49:56] Elijah when Elijah said no you're the
[49:58] one causing the trouble why didn't Ahab
[50:00] actually take that statement and
[50:02] actually think about
[50:04] that cuz he was so emotionally charged
[50:07] and so clouded in his mind he wasn't
[50:09] willing to say God is is this you
[50:12] speaking to me to take the secret fault
[50:13] from my
[50:15] life now we're not enemies here right no
[50:19] I'll answer that right we're
[50:21] friends okay but you see sometimes
[50:24] wounds must happen and because there's a
[50:27] surgery that takes
[50:29] place right but the first thing is do
[50:32] you go and pray for that person because
[50:35] when the word is being fulfilled a lot
[50:37] of blind spots are being
[50:39] exposed amen like like the scribes and
[50:42] Pharisees King Herod all those ones they
[50:45] were totally blinded to what God was
[50:48] doing even even even Joseph had some
[50:51] blind spots to the word but God because
[50:53] he was sincere in his heart God showed
[50:55] him the blind spot what this is me you
[50:58] can trust you can trust her on this one
[51:01] her testimony is right you're following
[51:03] me tonight right so so God could take
[51:06] those blind spots away you know maybe
[51:08] it's just a you know maybe it's just
[51:09] being so indifferent can be a blind spot
[51:13] you know having no empathy with someone
[51:15] someone tries to talk to you about
[51:16] something it's just like they're talking
[51:17] to a w and they go away less you know
[51:20] feeling worse than when they started
[51:21] talking to you it could be a blind spot
[51:24] maybe it can just be appearing to be
[51:26] unre friend
[51:28] ly well I'm going through something
[51:30] we're all going through something but
[51:32] we're here for one another you know if
[51:35] you want God to answer prayer on for you
[51:37] start praying for someone else start
[51:40] lifting others before the Lord you'll
[51:41] see God begin to speak deal in your life
[51:43] and deal in your family's life sometimes
[51:45] we and now this is definitely me I get
[51:47] caught up in my own little world and
[51:50] what I'm going through what about what
[51:51] others are going through what about more
[51:54] more important things
[51:57] I'm putting myself here right you see
[51:59] but so we're going to look beyond what
[52:00] the thing we're dealing with and begin
[52:02] to reach
[52:04] out reach out to others and see what you
[52:06] know God wants to
[52:09] do
[52:11] amen so there they are they're in
[52:13] Bethlehem now Jesus is born the
[52:17] Shepherds come the Shepherds go the a
[52:20] the word of the Angel of the Lord still
[52:22] is true that what he promised to Mary he
[52:25] will perform it
[52:27] amen and it's very easy to look back now
[52:30] I'm just kind of going back to where I
[52:32] started I'm going to jump to the end
[52:33] again it's very easy to look back and
[52:35] say of course the Lord looked after
[52:38] her he was faithful to what he promised
[52:41] he performed that which he had promised
[52:43] now how about you and I we're in the
[52:46] middle of a Rapture season it's like
[52:49] where it's like where Mary and Jesus is
[52:52] in the manger it's not at the end of the
[52:54] story we're in the middle of the story
[52:57] right but if the Lord if the word of the
[52:59] Lord came to her and saidou going to
[53:01] have the promised son you are the
[53:02] Fulfillment of that of that prophecy a
[53:05] virgin shall conceive and your son's
[53:07] going to be called Emanuel he's going to
[53:09] be he's the Messiah and all these things
[53:11] and God fulfilled that cannot we take
[53:15] confidence in what the Lord has promised
[53:18] you and I there came a moment friends I
[53:20] trust has been that this message goes
[53:23] from more than brother braham's voice to
[53:26] God's speaking the voice behind the
[53:27] voice right where he spoke of a Rapture
[53:30] he spoke of the word coming open he
[53:33] spoke of you know protocals coming home
[53:35] he spoke about many different promises
[53:37] in the word he spoke about the you know
[53:39] the third pull and Mary experienced the
[53:42] third pull brought life she's speaking
[53:44] to Elizabeth Elizabeth you know the baby
[53:47] hasn't moved for six months or hasn't at
[53:50] all and she's 6 months pregnant and then
[53:52] now Mary under inspiration speaks and to
[53:54] testify of what God had told her
[53:57] amen there's power in testimony and then
[53:59] when she comes down to a point of her
[54:00] testimony where Gabriel says you'll call
[54:02] his name Jesus I mean the first time
[54:04] that that blessed name was spoken in a
[54:07] testimony to another part of the body
[54:09] what happened as as Elizabeth was was
[54:11] filled with the Holy Ghost and John
[54:13] jumped for joy and it was actually
[54:16] promised that he will receive the holy
[54:17] ghost from his mother's womb what the
[54:20] power of the spoken word brought
[54:22] life amen we're living in that season
[54:25] amen
[54:27] amen but I think we need to be very
[54:29] sensitive in this season Lord cleanse me
[54:32] of my secret
[54:33] faults am I too proud that I can't take
[54:36] correction am I stubborn can I not
[54:40] forgive that can be a very much a you
[54:42] know where people say they forgive but
[54:44] they haven't forgiven here or there can
[54:47] be a secret fault of people are too
[54:49] intense they get so fixated on certain
[54:51] things and it has to be that way or the
[54:53] highway you're they're not willing to
[54:55] step back and say okay Lord is this
[54:58] actually what you want me to do and it
[55:00] but you know but in their mind it must
[55:02] be this way and this is and you know
[55:04] who's experienced
[55:06] that they get so fixated it's got to be
[55:09] this that can be a secret fault cuz we
[55:12] got to realize when you feel intense
[55:14] yeah I get moments of great intense
[55:17] feelings myself are you so relaxed not
[55:20] all the time I'm like the duck you know
[55:21] swimming along looks Karma but under
[55:23] under the water I'm paddling a lot
[55:27] right but I've got to realize when I get
[55:29] that intense feeling I need to step
[55:32] back amen I say Lord show me the big
[55:35] picture cuz all I'm seeing right now is
[55:37] this is this log coming and I'm paddling
[55:40] and I got to move out with something you
[55:41] know but really what what about the big
[55:44] picture amen you see it can be a secret
[55:49] fault Lord cleanse so in this season you

[55:55] special

[57:09] person has to say why is this why is
[57:11] that brother or sister have to come and
[57:12] tell me those things why does God have
[57:14] to arrange things this way for this to
[57:16] be exposed that's not fair the Lord
[57:18] knows how to deal just like Joseph why
[57:20] does the Caesar have to tax and blah
[57:22] blah blah and all these things God had
[57:23] to move them to for for Jesus to be born
