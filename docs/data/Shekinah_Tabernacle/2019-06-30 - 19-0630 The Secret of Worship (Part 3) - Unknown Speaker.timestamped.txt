[4:24] he's going to lose and things aren't
[4:26] going a certain way but he always wins
[4:28] in the end
[4:28] somehow whether it be in five minutes or
[4:31] five years or 50 years he always wins
[4:33] Laura or a lifetime of the existence of

[38:00] steam of worship translates to action
[38:04] and our high calling that sounds like
[38:07] quite a mouthful but really it's worship
[38:09] and action that's what we need
[38:13] worship and action amen let's read from
[38:17] James chapter one verses 19 to 21 yes
[38:25] Louie yeah well God as good doesn't he
[38:27] who loves the Lord a man who's glad to
[38:31] be in the house of the Lord amen rain
[38:33] hail or shine middle of winter we're
[38:37] here me hallelujah amen
[38:40] oh my hallelujah
[38:43] say Amen when you're found the scripture
[38:45] amen hallelujah wherefore my beloved
[38:49] brethren amen
[38:51] let us let every man be swift to hear
[38:55] that's quick to listen or how we want to
[38:59] speak before listening many time but let
[39:02] every man and children listening be
[39:06] quick to hear slow to speak oh lord help
[39:12] me and slow to wrath for the wrath of
[39:17] man worketh not the righteousness of God
[39:21] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[39:25] superfluity of naughtiness there's a
[39:30] super abundance of naughtiness of
[39:32] maliciousness of grudges and anger
[39:38] against other people against things and
[39:41] frustrations and all those things lay
[39:45] apart boasting and receive with meekness
[39:49] the engrafted word which is able to save
[39:53] your souls god blesses where you may be
[39:56] seated
[39:58] you know i was just sitting in my lazy
[40:00] boy at home just before and I was really
[40:04] rejoicing over that you know I had the
[40:07] initial reading was actually all the way
[40:08] down to verse 25 but I started getting
[40:11] so blessed by this thought right here I
[40:13] see it now I'm not gonna keep them
[40:14] standing because I might keep them
[40:16] standing too long you know so we'll just
[40:18] stop it there you know because I'm just
[40:20] so you know that word salvation you know
[40:22] the word receiving with meekness the
[40:25] word and this is what we've been going
[40:27] through the whole time as the word
[40:29] what's in it is it's God's law it's his
[40:32] expression it's as will it's his power
[40:35] this life and there's worked and with
[40:38] meekness we just humble yourself and
[40:41] receive it it's got like and it can it
[40:44] can come to you and it can come into
[40:45] your life it can come into your
[40:47] situation where you are right now
[40:49] because the word salvation there's
[40:52] another word which got me quite excited
[40:54] and that's salvaged you know sometimes
[40:57] we find ourselves in a wreck and that
[40:59] Ricky can come in many forms that Rick
[41:02] can come in a form of a mental wreck you
[41:05] can get so battered and bruised by the
[41:06] enemy and he can he can just get your
[41:09] stood up because of family traits and
[41:12] because of this thing here and something
[41:14] happened there any users that against
[41:16] you to bring you into a wreck and on the
[41:19] outside everything can look fine but
[41:21] inside this turmoil going on and that
[41:25] wreck the word is able to self at you
[41:28] hallelujah I thought men of readers
[41:31] received the word tonight amen
[41:34] the word has power contained in it now
[41:38] now now as the word goes forth you know
[41:42] there can be a reaction to that word
[41:45] because it's an expression of God's
[41:47] burden he has a burden for URI as a
[41:50] burden for me as a burden for the church
[41:52] here here's a burden for the vision he
[41:53] has a burden to see his will and follow
[41:57] to see prophecies fulfilled to see a
[42:00] people ratchet it's a burden of the Lord
[42:04] this is what he wants so what he does is
[42:07] he anoints gifts and not just preaching
[42:09] but every gift in the body is anointed
[42:12] and to express the burden of the Lord to
[42:17] communicate with his people to raise up
[42:20] a standard because inside that word has
[42:22] power to salvage hallelujah and I got so
[42:26] excited it was tickling me I understand
[42:28] what brother Branham is bio just it
[42:30] tickled me all over you know you just
[42:32] felt so happy like something's tickling
[42:35] you on the inside of your heart you know
[42:37] it just feels so good and I'm like man
[42:39] it's so cool the Lord salvaged me and I
[42:42] find myself failing and falling on the
[42:44] ground and we all come into that place
[42:46] we just fall down as fail and he
[42:49] salvages you someone comes to you or he
[42:51] sends somebody sent a ministering spirit
[42:54] II since an angel he sends a person and
[42:56] a speaker word and season and it
[42:59] salvages you because with meekness you
[43:02] don't know look what you did don't say
[43:04] that to me you're not above me yeah we
[43:07] get that something if we get like that
[43:08] we kind of get nothing you know if we
[43:11] get all defensive twice is just with
[43:14] meekness
[43:15] because we're not we don't all have it
[43:17] together we don't all have but none of
[43:20] us have got it all together let him who
[43:22] thinks he stands take heed lest he fall
[43:25] the Bible says you know we need each
[43:28] other
[43:28] and God you know when we're just
[43:30] sensitive to the spirit he can salvage
[43:32] each one of us from rings from failures
[43:35] from being down in the guns and we were
[43:38] up on the mountaintops you know there's
[43:41] a point proportion for us when we're
[43:43] there to help the ones that are in the
[43:45] valley and when someone's in the valley
[43:47] you know they're getting experience
[43:48] they're becoming more refined they're
[43:51] becoming more like though they're
[43:52] becoming purified but then there's
[43:54] people on the mountaintop better in
[43:57] their place and God they're less so in a
[44:00] place with the law we can speak through
[44:01] them and a word can come and see them
[44:03] through there and help the one that's
[44:05] down in the valley amen the wrath of
[44:10] Manion and this is where you know the
[44:12] anger of men you know can get angry at
[44:16] things things can make us angry
[44:18] let's just be slow to anger you don't
[44:22] use anger just don't let anger prevail
[44:24] in your life if you feel angry deal with
[44:27] it straight away you know if you let
[44:30] anger just sit inside your spirit
[44:32] you let anger stay in there and just
[44:34] it's like a residue and the atmosphere
[44:37] it starts to paint you it's like you
[44:39] know you marinate a steak you know you
[44:42] leave it sitting for long enough that
[44:43] the flavor goes down into the steak it
[44:46] goes deep into the steak and everything
[44:49] tastes like their atmosphere that garlic
[44:52] atmosphere him the garlic of Egypt amen
[44:56] that's what it's like when you let anger
[44:58] or malice or something
[45:00] set in your spirit straight away you are
[45:07] the master of your own free will God's
[45:10] not gonna do it for you you have to
[45:12] decide those things you know you you're
[45:14] the one that has the last say in your
[45:18] life whether you yield whether you let
[45:20] God whether you let the word and graft
[45:25] into your life so that it can salvage
[45:27] ooh
[45:28] from the condition you're in and every
[45:31] single one of us in this room right now
[45:33] needs salvager because we're all in it
[45:36] we're not perfect yeah
[45:37] I mean God sees us perfect yes through
[45:39] the blood man we're already in glory in
[45:41] eternity but right now it's still
[45:44] victories to be won still things to be
[45:46] gained amen and so there's a salvaging
[45:50] process going on and when you let anger
[45:54] come in and it residue and then someone
[45:57] tries to help you you know or the Lord
[45:59] sends somebody or the word comes forth
[46:01] and you take it personally and you get
[46:03] all offended by it that's not going to
[46:04] do nothing for you
[46:05] you're just gonna get metal but the rest
[46:08] of man does not work the righteousness
[46:11] of God it cannot produce the
[46:14] righteousness of God and when you look
[46:16] around and you see things happening or
[46:18] you see something that is not right and
[46:20] you think I'm gonna get and you get mad
[46:22] about it it's not gonna do no good it's
[46:25] not gonna help nobody that's all it's
[46:27] going to do is the worst thing it does
[46:30] is that hinders your own walk hinders
[46:33] your own atmosphere and Satan's won in
[46:36] your life temporarily because he's got
[46:38] you angry about something and then you
[46:40] sit there and stew on and you think
[46:42] about it it consumes your life you can't
[46:44] let that because you have to be all if
[46:47] these wisdom wisdom when that thing
[46:50] comes you have got authority to pick it
[46:53] out and you got Authority and you're a
[46:56] son you have that ability to worship and
[46:59] you have the ability to praise and see
[47:02] the atmosphere push down this is all the
[47:05] devil wants right you can't take away
[47:07] your salvation you can't take away the
[47:09] fact if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[47:10] can't do that what he can do is he takes
[47:12] you out of the atmosphere we to render
[47:16] you cold formal and powerless by the
[47:21] most simple things you can imagine using
[47:24] your own human nature against you
[47:26] that's why anger you might get upset
[47:30] about something being angry and
[47:32] frustrated about it will not work the
[47:34] righteousness of God it's not going to
[47:37] change the scenario it's going to do
[47:39] worse you end up becoming part of the
[47:41] problem and
[47:42] a solution to the problem you know in
[47:44] business maybe yeah I'll say in business
[47:48] there's nothing worse than a problems
[47:51] based business or a problems based
[47:53] contractor or someone that all they do
[47:55] is present problems to you what's the
[47:58] point in loving if you all you do is
[48:00] present problems to people when this
[48:03] solutions now I'm not saying that you
[48:06] don't go and confess your faults and all
[48:08] that but when all you do is you're a
[48:11] scourge and a problem two scenarios and
[48:14] you see something in and you just try
[48:16] and add your infestation of malison and
[48:19] ant naughtiness to it it's not gonna let
[48:22] the righteousness of God it's not gonna
[48:24] change anything because when divine love
[48:32] unconditional love its projected
[48:35] sovereign grace comes a situation the
[48:39] word comes false because you're yielded
[48:41] you're in an atmosphere you're not angry
[48:43] hello lujah not angry in a good place
[49:01] you could be going for the horrible time
[49:04] but you're in a good place I pull said
[49:06] we're just past down forsaken beaten but
[49:09] always rejoicing hello yeah you know why
[49:13] you need to be always rejoicing
[49:15] this is Nellas 'dom this is now you know
[49:18] you've realizing who you are staying in
[49:21] that place of of great at good
[49:23] atmosphere where God can use you to heal
[49:27] situations and become a solutions based
[49:29] business Alleluia it's like we you know
[49:34] in business now we do well we've got we
[49:37] our clients like us because we're
[49:39] wearing we've provided them solutions
[49:41] even if it's a stupid problem and it's
[49:44] done we make a solution first didn't we
[49:46] ring with people better you know you
[49:49] know they get stuck in their own ways
[49:51] and they get caught up in their and
[49:52] dogmatic natures and that all they do is
[49:54] ring the same people
[49:56] and they just provide them this is a
[49:57] problem this is your problem you sorted
[49:59] out it's not let's not be problems based
[50:03] people amen this be solutions based and
[50:07] there's only one solution it's him it's
[50:11] Jesus Christ anger frustrations not
[50:14] going to work that type of righteousness
[50:16] not gonna bring everything into line
[50:18] it's useless only thing that's good for
[50:22] it's to get your attention
[50:24] and it might frustrate you some
[50:27] idiosyncrasy might frustrate you I might
[50:29] frustrate you of my absolute crazy style
[50:32] of pretty you know but don't don't like
[50:36] hold that just pray for me pray for
[50:41] whoever that's frustrating you because
[50:43] it might be something wrong it might be
[50:45] something bad
[50:46] but the only don't frustrate pray for
[50:48] them and in their atmosphere you know
[50:51] because you know the Holy Spirit is
[50:54] timid and this was something very
[50:57] crucial the Holy Spirit is timid so what
[51:00] the devil does he knows that he'll keep
[51:02] you in a negative atmosphere he knows
[51:05] you he knows all your traits he knows
[51:06] your family knows your history knows
[51:08] what push your buttons she's gonna keep
[51:11] you he's like if you are a thermometer
[51:14] right a thermometer is reads the
[51:17] atmosphere reads it if you were like
[51:20] that the devil's going to keep you down
[51:21] he's gonna keep you on the ground he's
[51:24] gonna keep you simmering frustrated at
[51:27] everything
[51:28] problems based because you're in the
[51:30] wrong atmosphere you're not made for
[51:32] that you're made to live in perfect love
[51:36] you're made to live in the presence that
[51:38] turn sticks into trees again oh my and
[51:41] the reason that a stick turned back into
[51:44] a tree is because it was a tree the
[51:47] presence of God bringing you back into
[51:49] that place where you're you're useful to
[51:52] the Lord
[51:53] become fruitful amen
[51:58] so that he can use you or you can be
[52:00] salvaged he can use you to salvage
[52:03] through when you're on the mountaintop
[52:05] or if you're in the valley and you're
[52:07] really down and it's so far down and
[52:09] maybe you don't even know it
[52:11] if this meet get rid of the anger
[52:14] frustration the naughtiness all of those
[52:16] things filthiness he can salvage you
[52:19] salvaging and the work because it's the
[52:24] word Amen oh yeah James 1:22 225 it says
[52:31] bit but be you doers of the word and not
[52:34] hearers only deceiving your own selves
[52:37] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[52:39] not a doer he is like unto a man
[52:41] beholding his natural face in a glass
[52:46] not want to behold our natural face all
[52:50] the time
[52:50] I'll see your natural you want to see
[52:52] the supernatural face the one that God
[52:55] saw oh my I only just saw that in and
[52:58] it's good don't want to keep saying look
[53:01] ignored your you wanna you want to see
[53:03] the real you but if you get down on
[53:06] yourself and you can dimming yourself
[53:08] and you're calling yourself names in
[53:10] your head because you're frustrated keep
[53:13] holding you that because and because I'm
[53:16] talking about worship an action here but
[53:17] I'm building to there you the word goes
[53:21] forth the word comes forth to show you
[53:25] to reveal something to God's expressing
[53:27] himself now it's time to either than
[53:29] graft the power Salvage you to put you
[53:33] into action a man to bring you up
[53:37] because as you act upon the word it
[53:39] starts to change your physicality change
[53:44] your atoms amen
[53:45] change your thinking spiritually and
[53:48] physically it's been touched on it a
[53:51] while back on the Wednesday talked about
[53:53] the brain and all of this the electrics
[53:57] you know the way you think because this
[53:59] thought your brain is like this place
[54:02] where the spiritual merges with the
[54:04] physical do you understand that such a
[54:07] powerful thought when you realize that
[54:09] that spiritual
[54:12] things and thoughts and feelings and
[54:15] emotions become physical right there
[54:18] it's the merging epicenter of spiritual
[54:23] physical I don't even know the word the
[54:28] party of the party going on inside there
[54:32] with the spiritual aspects of your life
[54:34] and the feelings start to have a
[54:37] physical representation and so when you
[54:40] start doing the word you start acting
[54:42] upon the word and you humble yourself
[54:43] and leave the word and graft take down
[54:47] the barriers pick down the pride take
[54:50] down all of the things that would know
[54:53] the word going forth become supple you
[54:58] know it's very easy to become supple we
[55:01] thing I've been like this all my life
[55:03] it's just too hard for me I was raised
[55:05] this way a being this way all my life
[55:07] there's power in this room to speak can
[55:12] you Limit God to change you right now
[55:14] can God not change you right now you
[55:17] know brother branham he was seeing that
[55:19] snake remember the Lord said you combine
[55:20] the snake and everything under him and
[55:24] he said to the Prophet but you need to
[55:25] be more sincere you notice the vision
[55:27] you've run Signet Virginia in the snakes
[55:29] there and he's talking about how you
[55:30] have authority over Lucifer and all the
[55:32] demons under him and you have power men
[55:35] being it last week - and you have power
[55:37] to bind them but he said to brother
[55:40] Branham you need to be more sincere and
[55:43] and it wasn't a big transaction and a
[55:46] lot months of like changing his
[55:48] behaviour it was just right there he
[55:50] said love for mine sincerity help me
[55:53] make me more sincere look and in an any
[55:57] bad number so hip is straight away it
[56:00] wasn't some big groveling experience
[56:01] roman catholic style you know the way
[56:04] that we were try and do it the some
[56:05] victorian leadership it's not the way as
[56:09] catholicism denominationalism this man
[56:11] Age ideas God the God of all Grace and
[56:15] power is here to salvage you from a
[56:18] condition and we're all in a condition
[56:22] right now you know we all and and
[56:26] all in conditions we're in a condition
[56:28] we're in a you know when we get to
[56:30] Eternity we're gonna go man was I like
[56:31] there but I can't believe we were there
[56:34] well I mean what's going to be so much
[56:36] greater than what we can imagine but
[56:37] right now it's normal right you get used
[56:39] to it
[56:39] humans are climate eyes we acclimatized
[56:42] to our atmospheres we acclimatize to the
[56:44] darkness you know when you if you've
[56:46] been in great light and then you walk
[56:48] inside and it's dark you can't see and
[56:51] then all of a sudden if you spend enough
[56:52] time in that dark atmosphere you start
[56:55] to see better they open up and all that
[56:58] that must become lighter that's what
[57:00] happens in this world let's get stuck in
[57:02] it but what we need is a Holy Ghost
[57:07] lifting up and lifting up into
[57:09] atmospheres where you see it for what it
[57:11] is but you cannot in this God and then I
[57:15] think I'm gonna just carry on now what
[57:20] behold verse 24 for he beholdeth himself
[57:25] and goeth his way and straightway
[57:28] forgetteth what manner of man he was
[57:33] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[57:36] of liberty i like that and continuous
[57:39] therein if you continue in my word then
[57:42] you are my disciples indeed you shall
[57:44] know the truth and the truth shall make
[57:46] you free
[57:47] so we're on a journey and it's opening
[57:50] up its unfolding and we're continuing in
[57:52] the word and we're pressing the devil
[57:54] back to continue on the journey because
[57:56] when you start advancing he's getting
[57:58] shaking because he knows that the more
[58:00] you advance the more we come up the more
[58:03] we mature the more land that God leads
[58:06] us through to take when you actually
[58:08] take a stand and stop pushing and
[58:10] shaking he's shaking it is destroying
[58:15] him because he he does not want any more
[58:20] second atoms on the earth he does not
[58:22] want any more because he knows this time
[58:25] is finished and he knows that inside you
[58:28] already as the very ark that will defeat
[58:32] him inside you already is the very power
[58:35] but what he wants to do is keep the head
[58:38] in silence and you
[58:40] keep that in silence by keeping you in a
[58:41] negative state in an atmosphere and
[58:44] unbelief you'll keep you a complex so
[58:47] that you can't believe the word but
[58:50] there's power in this room tonight
[58:52] there's power with you all the time to
[58:56] defeat that enemy and you just hit the
[58:59] push you just have to push never give up
[59:04] ever give up no matter how bad you feel
[59:07] that it hard rotten you feel no matter
[59:09] what you fail just keep pushing the Mack
[59:13] I know you know you pray say lord help
[59:17] me
[59:17] there's someone comes and they've got
[59:21] the engrafting word for you no no they
[59:24] just come in to be loving you know cuz
[59:25] that love was the predicted right and
[59:27] they might have done something to you
[59:29] that you didn't even know that was wrong
[59:30] I'm sorry you might have done something
[59:32] to them and I've hurt them but they come
[59:33] to you laugh I'm not angry they love you
[59:38] they want to help you in God's got a
[59:40] word they don't know maybe they do but

[1:04:16] reaction to god's revelation you know
[1:04:19] that because God reveals himself right
[1:04:22] through the Bible God would reveal
[1:04:24] himself and as he revealed himself his
[1:04:27] name came with that revelation you know
[1:04:29] he revealed himself to Adam at first
[1:04:32] before there was any Adam there was God
[1:04:33] out of him then when there's a family he
[1:04:36] was Lord God L you know the the God that
[1:04:40] makes a family were to express himself
[1:04:42] then as he unfolded himself right down
[1:04:44] through Abraham's ministry and his time
[1:04:46] his name kept changing as God revealed
[1:04:49] himself so God would Express Abraham
[1:04:52] would see it and he would worship he
[1:04:54] would lay the sacrifice out and you'd
[1:04:56] call on the name of Jehovah
[1:04:57] Sakhi knew then hear call name of
[1:05:00] Jehovah Shalom and call on the name of
[1:05:02] Jehovah a lamb and call on the name of
[1:05:04] Jehovah Jireh the provider
[1:05:07] based on the revelation of God that is
[1:05:10] how God works with his people to every
[1:05:14] age every time Ephrata generation he
[1:05:16] expresses himself now worship worship
[1:05:21] make it more than just a rejoicing in
[1:05:24] church when the presence of them but
[1:05:27] read the word and just think about
[1:05:32] tomorrow's work think about how busy you
[1:05:34] are and when the devil comes and tries
[1:05:36] to make you feel frustrated but just
[1:05:38] before you're about to pray push him
[1:05:41] back pray anyway with all your heart you
[1:05:45] may feel like it doesn't do anything
[1:05:47] because the devil's fighting he doesn't
[1:05:49] want you to really pray doesn't want you
[1:05:51] to enjoy your relationship yet the fight
[1:05:55] it's a war this is a war there are times
[1:06:00] where it's easy there are times when you
[1:06:02] just rejoice in your shouting and it's
[1:06:03] amazing and it's easy the presence of
[1:06:06] God is pouring out everywhere and there
[1:06:08] are times Spirit of the nation's trying
[1:06:12] to shake you down
[1:06:13] keep you down I mean try and pray it's
[1:06:16] like this pressure kind of keep you from
[1:06:19] really praying oh you know I just
[1:06:21] encourage you really pray anyway believe
[1:06:25] faith is not a feeling faith is a belief
[1:06:29] pray without the feeling and you'll see
[1:06:33] what happened just pray without you
[1:06:35] don't need to feel good don't worry
[1:06:38] about feelings as much as I'm a man I'm
[1:06:41] a burm advocate for heartfelt religion I
[1:06:44] think we should be very hot but there's
[1:06:48] many times when you're not gonna feel
[1:06:50] good but you believe and I think Daniel
[1:06:52] felt very good when he was stuck in
[1:06:54] Babylon burden with the sins of Israel
[1:06:58] he prayed and he believed and pushed
[1:07:01] through the Prince of Persia that demon
[1:07:03] that was holding all those angels back
[1:07:04] even you know gay people or whatever the
[1:07:06] Angels things with hard to get there
[1:07:10] it's a fight here to call on
[1:07:12] reinforcements to get to Daniel can you
[1:07:14] imagine that Babylonian pressure on him
[1:07:17] without the Holy Ghost but he just
[1:07:19] right anyway and he believed just
[1:07:23] believed so I encourage you and when you
[1:07:26] don't feel like it
[1:07:27] and you feel like oh my is this even
[1:07:29] worth praying I don't even feel like I'm
[1:07:31] in a good atmosphere just pray anyway
[1:07:32] speaking just Paul on the name of the
[1:07:34] law be surprised what happened he
[1:07:38] answers your prayer according to your
[1:07:39] faith not how good you feel
[1:07:41] amen hallelujah that's putting your
[1:07:46] worship into action amen
[1:07:49] you know you get all steamed up and
[1:07:50] stimulate it you get so excited on my
[1:07:55] lazy was so happy I put it to her I'm
[1:07:59] gonna read a quote in a minute the
[1:08:01] Pentecostals you know there was guys
[1:08:02] complaining brother brain I'm about the
[1:08:03] Pentecostals let's get in the revival
[1:08:05] days there was just throwing chairs and
[1:08:08] running up and down and doing all these
[1:08:10] crazy things to the eyes of the world
[1:08:14] but they were just so joyous and so
[1:08:17] stimulated by the presence of God that
[1:08:20] they could they were blowing the steam
[1:08:21] off and blowing their whistles rather
[1:08:24] brannon he says I'll read it in a minute
[1:08:27] it's got to be put to work all of that
[1:08:30] joy all of that channel of inspiration
[1:08:33] all of those things make your calling
[1:08:36] and election sure go before the Lord not
[1:08:40] just pure warmers we're not just Sunday
[1:08:43] Wednesday worshipers but our worship
[1:08:47] should be every hour every moment when
[1:08:52] you're at work live the life share with
[1:08:57] somebody where you find an open door
[1:09:00] find souls for him some way whether it's
[1:09:03] prayer whether it's funding something
[1:09:06] with your resource whether it's being a
[1:09:10] mercy for somebody that's a need whether
[1:09:13] it's whatever it may be make your
[1:09:15] calling an election sure ask the Lord
[1:09:17] what am I here for what's my purpose in
[1:09:20] life what have you called me fall on
[1:09:22] what's what is the gift in my life cuz
[1:09:28] that part that God gave all of you
[1:09:32] you have a choice now you can yield it
[1:09:35] to the devil or you can yield it to God
[1:09:39] well it's a very this is a no-brainer I
[1:09:43] think we should yield it to the Lord
[1:09:44] you're going to get a better result
[1:09:46] because what the devil does if you ever
[1:09:49] read any testimonies of anybody and I
[1:09:51] and I see it all the time in the news
[1:09:53] and all those things any one that yields
[1:09:56] their gift to Satan and he actually sees
[1:09:59] the potential in it he'll anoint it and
[1:10:01] he'll use it and then he'll destroy it
[1:10:03] he'll throw them in the rubbish bin just
[1:10:06] kill them and destroy them and then
[1:10:08] torment them in Hell he does not care
[1:10:11] about them and he doesn't care about you
[1:10:13] doesn't care about me but God has made
[1:10:17] you he has orchestrated your genealogies
[1:10:20] he has orchestrated your scenario he's
[1:10:24] orchestrated into the frustrations
[1:10:25] he's orchestrated the good things he's
[1:10:27] orchestrated everything in your life to
[1:10:30] make you a certain way and he placed the
[1:10:35] gift in here which is the part of
[1:10:36] himself that when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:10:39] it quickens it and it seems lightning
[1:10:44] down into it revelation and it comes
[1:10:47] alive and that's what you're made for
[1:10:50] when it comes to use it bet gift I'm not
[1:10:54] meaning just preachers or one or talking
[1:10:55] about all the gifts in the body when
[1:10:58] that gift was a neck place with the Lord
[1:11:00] humbled yielded to the Spirit of God
[1:11:03] will stay in perfect harmony with the
[1:11:06] other gifts in the body will stay in
[1:11:08] perfect harmony with the pillar fire
[1:11:11] with the unfolding of the Word of God
[1:11:14] with the revelation of Jesus Christ was
[1:11:16] the program the campaign with the sheet
[1:11:20] music of the symphony coming to Rome
[1:11:23] coming to melody come into harmony
[1:11:25] coming to the the very spirit of the
[1:11:27] composer and move with the times
[1:11:30] signature as it unfolds in the beat
[1:11:32] speed and then the violins go and all of
[1:11:35] it goes coming together it's by those
[1:11:39] Gibson's
[1:11:40] that's worship an action that's taking
[1:11:45] this theme you rejoice remember
[1:11:51] rejoice push push beyond the boundaries
[1:11:56] of how you feel don't rejoice just
[1:11:59] because you feel good
[1:12:00] rejoice even when you don't feel good do
[1:12:04] you realize that we get some
[1:12:06] acclimatized that I'm only going to
[1:12:08] praise God if I feel head Hey
[1:12:12] what sort of praise is that do you want
[1:12:15] him to force you to praise him by his
[1:12:18] presence by coming down making you feel
[1:12:20] emotionally happy instead all that he
[1:12:23] gets or does he get your worship
[1:12:25] regardless of how you feel that winners
[1:12:27] worthless well if you got a met
[1:12:29] hallelujah oh Jesus hallelujah
[1:12:32] I'm sorry joy sing at your word oh
[1:12:34] because every divine expression has an
[1:12:38] appropriate reaction that's like a water
[1:12:42] a log but be be thankful be so eternally
[1:12:50] this is the divine expression of God if
[1:12:55] we could only see it do not rely on your
[1:12:58] feelings to praise them do not rely on
[1:13:01] your feelings to react but let the word
[1:13:06] build amen
[1:13:18] Satan cannot touch worship by revelation
[1:13:22] you know there's a there's a mandate on
[1:13:25] the devil he says see thou hurt not the
[1:13:28] oil in mine your and your stimulation
[1:13:32] your enjoyment your experience your oil
[1:13:37] and your wine the devil cannot touch it
[1:13:41] you cannot take it away from you you
[1:13:43] cannot take it away from you he can put
[1:13:46] you in a negative atmosphere he can he
[1:13:48] can he can try he can try and push you
[1:13:50] down he cannot steal revelation from you
[1:13:54] he cannot steal it from you
[1:13:56] he cannot steal those glorious times in
[1:13:59] his presence from you he can't steal
[1:14:01] when God shows you something and reveals
[1:14:04] something to you he cannot steal it he
[1:14:06] can never take it away
[1:14:08] he'll try but he can't because there's a
[1:14:11] mandate on him these of notice that's
[1:14:14] been served on earth hurt not the oil
[1:14:16] and the wine that's worship he cannot
[1:14:20] take away your worship so when you're
[1:14:22] willing no no matter how you feel no
[1:14:25] matter how hard it's been when you just
[1:14:27] come with your mind say I'm gonna
[1:14:28] worship kampf
[1:14:29] no matter what I feel no matter how much
[1:14:32] I've found it I'm just going to make it
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:34] because the power of the blood cleanses
[1:14:35] my sins and all my mistakes anything
[1:14:38] I've done no matter what it is when you
[1:14:40] sorry and you confess it and it's gone
[1:14:43] right there
[1:14:45] now you worship hallelujah that's
[1:14:48] exactly what the blood is for amen to
[1:14:52] forgive us of our sins all those things
[1:14:54] that happen lay them aside hallelujah
[1:14:57] all of those things
[1:15:02] but mr. Branum is one thing I'd like to
[1:15:05] ask you he said as this you said now if
[1:15:09] you did that I would like to say one
[1:15:11] thing what made you take up with the
[1:15:13] Pentecostals I said they believe the
[1:15:16] word he said what have they got I said I
[1:15:20] I've been around and seeing them kick
[1:15:22] over the tables and knock over the
[1:15:24] chairs man that's enough to raise up any
[1:15:27] hairs on a cold formal religion you know
[1:15:30] my can you see he says and I said oh
[1:15:34] sure that's right knock out a window or
[1:15:37] something like that I said sure see what

[1:15:44] Holy Ghost I said sure if they won't
[1:15:49] make the wheel roll right they've got to
[1:15:52] blow it out the whistle somewhere see
[1:15:55] that wasn't getting put to use because
[1:15:57] the messenger to the age hadn't come to
[1:15:59] take them McDonough mcc's and put the
[1:16:02] mechanics through it so that they could
[1:16:03] do it but we sit right now in a and the
[1:16:08] most precious place the church has ever

[1:16:18] everything to keep you down because he
[1:16:20] knows that the dynamics of mechanics are
[1:16:22] already together he knows that these
[1:16:24] dynamics in your life that can create a
[1:16:26] world that can ruin every file all as

[1:16:38] civilization highlights at all and push
[1:16:42] delete and then and then speak in a need
[1:16:45] any condition over this

[1:23:13] it the wheel roll right they're going to
[1:23:15] blow it out of the whistle somewhere
[1:23:16] they've got a lot of steam I said and
[1:23:19] that's the truth if this Pentecostal
[1:23:21] church would take a lot of its praises
[1:23:24] mine and put it to work it would do
[1:23:30] something for the kingdom of God God
[1:23:33] give you the Holy Ghost you like to
[1:23:37] shout by it and praised by it but just
[1:23:40] put that in to get I guess you know you

[1:23:48] away and you get so rejoicing rejoicing
[1:23:54] anointing that
[1:23:55] our that glory has a purpose it's not
[1:23:58] just to blow off the steam as nice as
[1:24:01] that feels but the wheels are gonna roll
[1:24:04] the gospel trains gonna stop moving
[1:24:06] there's got to be a purpose for your
[1:24:08] life there's a purpose and then
[1:24:10] anointing that that energy there's a
[1:24:13] purpose for you that's why the Bible
[1:24:15] says give all diligence give all
[1:24:18] diligence to make your calling and
[1:24:20] election sure they're very important

[1:24:36] always think that just bring it before
[1:24:38] the Lord oh Jesus what am I here for
[1:24:43] I rejoice at your word but I don't want
[1:24:46] I don't just want to worship on a Sunday
[1:24:48] in our last day and have the other
[1:24:50] experience in my closet or in my room or
[1:24:53] at work or wherever it may be but what's
[1:24:57] it for stream you know what Jeremiah
[1:25:04] said it burns in my bones amen
[1:25:09] everyone here is a purpose for you
[1:25:14] amen and the body
[1:25:17] you know when I cut my thumb I realize
[1:25:20] how much this little tiny thing here's a
[1:25:22] lot of use and it's very hard to live
[1:25:24] without this thing and I think man what
[1:25:26] does it like to have your arm chopped
[1:25:27] off
[1:25:28] oh my goodness it's not nice to have one
[1:25:31] thumb gone and even impaired you not
[1:25:33] kind of well but now I can kind of use
[1:25:36] it there's still and I realized how much
[1:25:39] I needed it how much that was needed and
[1:25:42] I think of that finger nail you know the
[1:25:44] finger now the the top of its gone back
[1:25:46] and I think oh I hope that comes back to
[1:25:49] my wife you know but even that has got a
[1:25:51] purpose you know those nails that stops
[1:25:53] the finger from you know because the
[1:25:55] bone stops about I don't know about
[1:25:57] fifty five millimeters back or something
[1:26:00] but if you had no nail your fluff your
[1:26:02] finger would be floppy so the
[1:26:04] fingernails got purpose so even if we're
[1:26:07] a fingernail it's
[1:26:09] divine purpose and it's needed we all
[1:26:12] need it hallelujah and we're coming to a
[1:26:16] place wig you know okay I don't want to
[1:26:19] get too deep on anything but we're

[1:26:26] it's not a limited portion of Christ and
[1:26:30] neck lift
[1:26:30] it's the Faunus you know like I said
[1:26:34] last week or yesterday I'm Sunday when

[1:26:47] come with a holy life a sanctification
[1:26:49] didn't just come with gifts but he came
[1:26:52] was an open book
[1:26:53] that's the baptismal Holy Ghost for us
[1:26:55] they had a baptism of the Holy Ghost -
[1:26:57] they had the the leadership of the Holy
[1:27:00] Ghost in midday but he just only had a
[1:27:02] portion he just held things back because
[1:27:04] they weren't really for the full
[1:27:05] strength what God does things in
[1:27:08] righteousness and he follows patterns
[1:27:10] and he follows nature because he created
[1:27:13] nature it's her story history is his
[1:27:17] story you understand that just blows my
[1:27:21] mind history is his story the revelation
[1:27:26] of her maneet writes himself and his
[1:27:29] ways and his personality right through
[1:27:31] all the nature through the stars through
[1:27:34] all the processes hallelujah that's why

[1:28:07] can to surround that gift to stop it
[1:28:10] from being expressed to become a talent
[1:28:12] hidden in the ground through complexes
[1:28:16] likes me I'm not accepted all those
[1:28:19] things I tried unday the Lord used me
[1:28:22] and then I was criticized and now I'm
[1:28:24] gonna hide it in the ground cause nobody

[1:28:30] time he says he'll try you try
[1:28:33] everything everything what does he want
[1:28:36] he wants you to be that man that hides
[1:28:38] the tellin in the ground it's what he
[1:28:40] wants because he knows that they could
[1:28:41] be appearing of Jesus Christ coming of
[1:28:46] the Son of Man will be expressed inside
[1:28:49] it amen
[1:28:51] I've said that many times if you've I
[1:28:53] mean a lot of us actually this is kind
[1:28:55] of like the original crew here so you
[1:28:57] know what I've preached before you know

[1:30:29] it's like you know a reflection of God's
[1:30:32] intelligence of the mind of God that's
[1:30:38] worship and actually because worship big

[1:36:02] open yourself to something and if you're
[1:36:05] not getting your entertainment from the
[1:36:07] word you're going to get it from Satan

[1:36:20] own imagination you're gonna worship
[1:36:21] your car you're gonna worship your job
[1:36:22] or you're gonna worship your popularity
[1:36:26] because you made you know people worship
[1:36:32] humans are made to worship even atheists
[1:36:36] as much as they would detest you saying

[1:36:41] soccer or worshiping rugby or
[1:36:42] worshipping some ball I mean hook come
