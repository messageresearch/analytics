[25:53] once again
[25:54] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[25:57] bless your friends you may have your
[25:58] seats tonight i just want to
[26:00] take a bit of a thought now this may go
[26:02] away kind of a segue but
[26:04] you know this uh my title brother ed
[26:06] said what's your title
[26:07] and i kind of scratched my head and i
[26:09] said well he cares for those who care
[26:11] and he says well it's locked in so you
[26:12] can't change it but
[26:13] it may not go down that way but um this
[26:16] it's very interesting this word
[26:18] care says casting all your care upon him
[26:21] for he careth for you now
[26:22] this word uh your care or care there
[26:26] it actually comes through the idea of a
[26:28] distraction
[26:30] so it's more than just a burden or a
[26:32] worry but it's actually something that's
[26:33] a
[26:33] distracting thing now what i like about
[26:36] my notes is i can go
[26:38] to the last page and i can go from the
[26:39] last page
[26:41] and i want to ask you a question
[26:44] it's well not really but i just want you
[26:46] to get think about this
[26:49] how does it how does a spirit achieve
[26:51] its goal
[26:53] now sometimes we think of a demon
[26:55] possession that's
[26:56] the devil achieving a goal or maybe a
[26:59] oppression that's the devil achieving a
[27:01] goal but
[27:02] i want to say if a spirit can actually
[27:04] push you off
[27:06] out of that realm of actually just
[27:08] walking in the sweetness of the holy
[27:09] ghost
[27:10] where nothing else matters and you're
[27:11] just totally abandoned to god
[27:13] that spirit has actually its goal
[27:16] it's achieved that goal you take um
[27:19] someone no now this is distractions
[27:22] we're gonna we're gonna take these
[27:23] distractions
[27:24] we're gonna stomp on them and return to
[27:26] sender that's basically the plan tonight
[27:29] okay so so so so for example someone
[27:31] comes along with a spirit just say it's
[27:33] coldness
[27:34] it's rebellion it's lust it's
[27:37] indifference
[27:38] it's you know sarcastic or it's you know
[27:40] a tail bearer gossip whatever it may be
[27:43] see and and you can identify that you're
[27:45] in contact with something that is not of
[27:48] god it may never overtake you it may
[27:51] never
[27:52] you know it may never possess you or
[27:54] even even even
[27:55] um you know what he could torment you in
[27:57] your mind
[27:58] but if it changes your worship to the
[28:01] lord
[28:02] that now your worship is different and
[28:04] the sweetness of the lord
[28:06] in your life has been replaced with
[28:09] walls
[28:10] and being reserved and you no longer act
[28:12] the same way
[28:13] you did before coming coming in contact
[28:15] with that spirit
[28:17] then i'll say that that spirit has
[28:19] achieved its goal
[28:22] amen because say well i don't have those
[28:23] spirits but but if it's pushed you off
[28:25] the path
[28:27] a bit it's achieved its goal but we're
[28:30] called to be steadfast
[28:32] but that steadfastness is going to be
[28:34] challenged
[28:35] i mean because the devil loves the
[28:36] challenge but god is never afraid of a
[28:38] challenge
[28:39] he loves a challenge too because he
[28:40] always overcomes every challenge so
[28:42] you know so if i if a spirit's pushed
[28:45] you a certain way
[28:47] that you're no longer worshiping you
[28:48] know you've left your first love
[28:51] then it's achieved its goal but we're
[28:54] here
[28:54] to to get back on the road
[28:58] if you're off the road i'm so thankful
[29:00] there's always a way back
[29:02] hallelujah so so this is what i want to
[29:04] talk about when i talk about the
[29:06] casting all your care upon him because
[29:08] he cares for you
[29:10] because this care is an idea of a of a
[29:12] distraction so anything now when i talk
[29:14] about distractions tonight
[29:15] i'm not going to talk about this i'm not
[29:17] going to talk about social media i'm not
[29:19] talking about all the easy stuff
[29:20] i'm going to talk about a distraction
[29:22] that's more subtle but actually is more
[29:23] powerful
[29:24] is that the distraction of the influence
[29:26] of a spirit
[29:28] because the influence of a spirit can be
[29:30] lingering in your life that what happens
[29:31] is you're no longer walking
[29:33] you know in in the love of god you know
[29:35] that sweetness of god when you first
[29:37] meet him
[29:38] you say well you're going by feelings
[29:41] tonight no i'm not
[29:42] love produces a feeling you know when
[29:44] you really
[29:45] know the love of god it's more than a
[29:47] doctrine it's not a doctrine it's a
[29:49] reality it's an experience
[29:51] where you fall in love with jesus christ
[29:53] and all you care about
[29:54] you know you live in the same body you
[29:56] may live in the same house the same job
[29:58] the same school the same friends the
[30:00] same everything the same church
[30:01] but the world is different i mean the
[30:04] sky looks different the clouds look
[30:05] different the flowers look different
[30:07] i mean even you look different in the
[30:09] mirror hallelujah your whole life is
[30:11] different because you've come in contact
[30:13] with life
[30:14] and that is life eternal and you're not
[30:16] too worried you know you may have the
[30:17] same challenges you had the day before
[30:19] but it's a little bit different today
[30:20] why because you're falling in love and
[30:22] it's like you're kind of floating around
[30:24] on
[30:25] floating along on cloud9 for a while
[30:28] the devil don't like people floating on
[30:30] that cloud he wants to push them off
[30:32] that place
[30:33] but i tell you tonight the bride is in
[30:35] love with jesus christ
[30:36] it's a love affair this message is a
[30:38] love letter amen between you
[30:40] and jesus christ hallelujah i believe
[30:43] the more that eliezer told rebecca about
[30:45] isaac the more she fell in love with
[30:47] isaac tell me more eleazar tell me more
[30:49] what does he really look like hallelujah
[30:52] and it was love at first what everything
[30:54] that he he
[30:55] she heard about on the journey amen just
[30:58] produced a love in her heart that when
[30:59] they came together when she saw isaac it
[31:01] was love at first sight
[31:03] and the scripture says that even him you
[31:05] have not seen yet you love
[31:08] hallelujah can you really love someone
[31:10] you've never seen absolutely
[31:13] hallelujah when it comes to the lord
[31:15] jesus amen absolutely you fall in love
[31:17] with him i tell you it's real
[31:19] the love of god is real amen but the
[31:22] devil doesn't want us to stay
[31:23] in love amen brother brahm says in the
[31:25] church age book i don't have the quote
[31:27] on me but
[31:27] he talks about the reformation time it
[31:29] would be the wrath of man if i
[31:32] get the words right praising god so so
[31:35] man what they would do is because
[31:36] denominations would rise and
[31:38] and arguments would rise people would
[31:40] worship god because they're angry at
[31:42] this guy
[31:43] so just say there's a split in the
[31:45] church you know they would keep
[31:46] worshiping god because of an offense
[31:48] that someone else caused
[31:49] as opposed to a pure relationship with
[31:51] god you say well we're not in a
[31:53] reformation era no we're not this is a
[31:55] transformation time
[31:56] this is a restoration time it means
[31:58] we're called to be restored
[32:00] back to our first love i mean that the
[32:02] church fell from
[32:03] hallelujah so we should never worship
[32:05] god because
[32:06] this guy did something to us you know
[32:08] we're going to separate between the
[32:10] person and the spirit
[32:11] right so when i'm talking about a
[32:12] distraction i'm not talking about a
[32:14] person
[32:15] and what i love about the scripture is
[32:17] god tells us where he's going to set up
[32:18] his banqueting feast
[32:20] hallelujah amen yeah we'll get there
[32:24] we'll get there
[32:25] so we don't have to worry really you
[32:27] know the apostle paul would say
[32:29] in uh first corinthians two and two
[32:31] let's just let's just go to this here
[32:33] um you know
[32:38] to overcome you have to overcome every
[32:40] we're gonna overcome everything
[32:42] we may have different walks and
[32:44] different battles but we're going to
[32:45] we're going to gather around the throne
[32:47] and we're going to give testimony of all
[32:49] that jesus overcame in our lives because
[32:51] he's the overcomer
[32:52] right and so there's going to be spirits
[32:54] and trouble and the effects of spirits
[32:57] that we have to overcome even even you
[33:00] know i always marvel when i think about
[33:02] i love caleb and joshua i love the story
[33:03] of the exodus of the going out and
[33:05] coming in
[33:06] and um it's amazing to me yeah you know
[33:09] it just it's so amazing how
[33:11] that younger generation
[33:14] broke the cycle of unbelief they were
[33:17] growing up with parents that weren't
[33:18] really believers but they were just
[33:20] church members
[33:21] but a revelation anchored in their
[33:23] hearts we're taking the land
[33:25] that when they came to the crossing over
[33:27] time they did not murmur they didn't
[33:28] complain they didn't have hearts of
[33:30] unbelief but they believed
[33:31] so that goes to show that you can be
[33:33] young people you can be living in a
[33:35] church where all the adults aren't
[33:36] believers
[33:38] but maybe a few all the others just
[33:39] hypocrites but god can do a work in your
[33:42] life that god will break the cycle
[33:44] that the effect of the unbelief of the
[33:46] parents will not filter down to the
[33:48] younger generation but the younger
[33:49] generation we're more than able to take
[33:51] this land
[33:52] amen let's go into the fullness of the
[33:53] holy ghost and get everything that
[33:54] belongs to us
[33:56] hallelujah so i love that because it
[33:57] just goes to show it doesn't matter what
[33:59] environment
[34:00] you know i was you know i saw a headline
[34:02] i should find the article but it said
[34:04] about how actually
[34:06] amazing people are birthed out of great
[34:08] trauma
[34:10] where it's actually been shown that
[34:11] actually amazing people they can come
[34:13] from very traumatic backgrounds
[34:15] but actually forges a certain character
[34:18] in them
[34:18] that they would never have had if they
[34:20] had an ideal upbringing
[34:23] amen i'll go read the article they'll
[34:25] get back to you on that one but
[34:26] apparently they've done a study on it
[34:27] and that's what they're shown
[34:29] so it's incredible that you know to me
[34:30] it goes to show you know we can we can
[34:33] give the best atmosphere and environment
[34:35] and family life and church life to our
[34:37] children but takes god
[34:39] amen it can be all stacked against them
[34:41] all for them but it takes god to light
[34:43] that flame
[34:44] amen and that's what we need is we need
[34:46] a good you know i heard brother brown
[34:47] today he was saying though he used to
[34:49] i i can't remember who was praying but
[34:50] but but he was relating a prayer someone
[34:52] said
[34:53] he said basically lord wrap him up and
[34:55] burlap sex
[34:56] pour a gallon of kerosene on him light
[34:58] him a fire and just send him forth
[35:00] you know hallelujah you know there's
[35:02] like a human torch going forth and you
[35:04] know
[35:04] i pray god does that for us all of us
[35:07] amen
[35:08] hallelujah wrap us in burlap sacks can
[35:10] you imagine that amen
[35:12] hallelujah and we ask lord bless them
[35:14] and keep them no no set them a flame
[35:16] god pour in your oil hallelujah wrap
[35:18] them up and
[35:19] hallelujah amen a human torch
[35:23] hallelujah so you know we can live in
[35:24] such a place that you know
[35:26] it doesn't matter where our upbringing
[35:29] is how ideal and ideal when god gets a
[35:31] hold of your life that's that's the
[35:32] difference maker right there
[35:34] now the apostle paul wait oh yeah
[35:36] corinthians not colossians that would
[35:37] have been interesting
[35:38] now let's go to um well you're probably
[35:41] already there but i
[35:42] obviously didn't get there
[35:48] the apostle paul was a prophet
[35:51] he could see god could show him things
[35:54] about people's lives
[35:56] but this is the one thing he really
[35:58] cared about when he came in amongst the
[36:00] believers
[36:01] he did not want to when he was
[36:02] journeying from church to church though
[36:04] he knew a lot of the people because they
[36:06] birthed under his ministry
[36:07] he wasn't interested in knowing what was
[36:09] going on in the church
[36:12] right he didn't want to line the
[36:14] ministers up before he preached and say
[36:15] now tell me all your problems
[36:17] and tell me what spirits are lingering
[36:19] around and tell me what's going on now
[36:20] he wasn't interested in that
[36:22] he just says for i determined not to
[36:24] know anything among you
[36:26] save jesus christ and him crucified
[36:28] that's all he wanted to know among them
[36:30] was actually god was living
[36:32] that's all he was interested in you know
[36:34] there'll be a lot there'll always be
[36:35] problems in the church
[36:37] there'll always be spirits in the church
[36:40] whether we like it or not there'll
[36:41] always be spirits
[36:42] there'll always be unbelief there'll
[36:44] always be trouble right up into the
[36:45] rapture
[36:46] right but unbelief doesn't hinder god
[36:50] hallelujah there was a lot of unbelief
[36:52] in the days of jesus
[36:54] amen but one woman with the blood or she
[36:56] said i'm going to push through all of
[36:57] that i'm going to touch the hem of his
[36:58] garment
[36:59] i mean blind bartimaeus had a lot of
[37:01] trouble one day when he heard
[37:03] jesus walking by and that don't worry
[37:05] it's got three legs it won't fall over
[37:06] um you know you know
[37:08] he was told you know who is passing by
[37:10] because he would just lie there you know
[37:12] lean against the
[37:13] wall your brick wall of the city and the
[37:15] sun would yo
[37:16] heat the bricks and then heat his back
[37:18] and you know he heard a bunch of noise
[37:20] going by and he'd say who is that who's
[37:22] coming what's going on because he's
[37:23] blind he can't see
[37:24] and then someone came along says it's
[37:25] jesus of nazareth i mean he's passing by
[37:28] and they say jesus who's this guy i said
[37:30] well he's you know he's he's raised the
[37:32] dead he's healed the sick he's
[37:34] you open the eyes of the blind you know
[37:36] he's done all these things and all the
[37:37] bible stories his mother told him
[37:39] growing up
[37:40] became living reality right in front of
[37:41] him and he began to cry out
[37:43] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[37:46] another saying
[37:47] quiet quiet be quiet be quiet yeah but
[37:50] but he did not let that hinder him
[37:52] what was that those people telling him
[37:54] to be quiet was unbelievable trying to
[37:56] push down his faith
[37:57] but he was determined here's my
[37:59] opportunity amen it was actually his
[38:01] faith that got a hold of jesus and jesus
[38:03] who is walking to calvary it says and
[38:05] jesus stood
[38:06] still hallelujah to answer his prayer
[38:09] wouldn't you love it tonight if jesus
[38:11] stood still he's walking by and your
[38:13] your faith grabs ahold of me stan still
[38:15] says what do you have need of
[38:18] unbelief doesn't hinder god
[38:21] hallelujah he will still get the job
[38:23] done
[38:25] amen if he's coming for and he's coming
[38:28] for me
[38:29] if he's coming for you know if he's
[38:31] coming for six of us well that's the
[38:32] glowing family
[38:34] hallelujah that's how we should be if
[38:37] he's coming for one
[38:38] if the rapture's one person here i am
[38:41] i'm here to get my blessing
[38:43] i'm here to get my refilling i'm here to
[38:45] worship god you know
[38:46] i came to the conclusion i don't preach
[38:48] for you guys
[38:49] i preach as a worship for god that may
[38:52] sound a bit crazy to you but you know
[38:54] we should sing a sing should be a
[38:55] worship you know the tech teams of
[38:57] worship amen we in the pews
[38:59] of worship hallelujah how we treat each
[39:01] other should be a worship
[39:03] i mean our whole life should be a
[39:04] worship to god so my preachings are
[39:06] really a worship to my father
[39:08] hallelujah well why are you here then
[39:10] you may think well no it's for you too
[39:12] but you know what i mean i don't do it
[39:13] for you
[39:14] and as opposed to you're patting me on
[39:16] the back and saying well done in a human
[39:18] thing i do it because i love him
[39:19] because i love him i love you amen hope
[39:23] that came out the right way
[39:24] now so all he wanted to know was
[39:28] jesus christ and him crucified among
[39:31] them
[39:31] and that's now what i'm talking about is
[39:33] not turning a blind eye
[39:35] i'm not talking about that because
[39:36] people might say well you're just trying
[39:37] to turn a blind eye and die
[39:39] no no no it's not about that what are we
[39:41] looking for we we have to come to the
[39:43] conclusion as i said
[39:44] the devil will be here until the rapture
[39:47] and then we leave and he stays
[39:49] right hell will be opened up those
[39:52] devils will still be here
[39:53] the moment we are gone they'll still be
[39:55] here
[39:56] so we have to come to the conclusion
[39:59] there's always going to be a battle
[40:01] even coming to church can be a battle
[40:03] and i'm just talking about myself
[40:05] amen but but the the more a battle comes
[40:08] it shows that revival is going to break
[40:10] forth
[40:11] there's always trouble amen legion was
[40:13] on one side of the sea
[40:15] and jesus was coming to to set him free
[40:17] on the other side
[40:18] and what happened it wasn't an easy trip
[40:20] across but a storm was whipped up
[40:22] because the devils are saying you're not
[40:23] crossing that sea you're not getting a
[40:25] hold of legion we've got him pinned down
[40:26] pretty good
[40:27] i mean but then the disciples finally
[40:29] woke the master he stood up said peace
[40:31] be still
[40:31] i mean the boat got to the other side
[40:33] wide to set legion free
[40:35] there's trouble before the victory
[40:38] hallelujah amen
[40:40] israel was was what yo yo israel's
[40:43] bondage in egypt got worse before the
[40:45] deliverance
[40:46] you know because you know because
[40:48] pharaoh said fine we give you straw now
[40:50] you get your own straw to make the brick
[40:52] so so the oppression became worse
[40:54] before the deliverance came but the
[40:55] deliverer was standing right there
[40:57] i mean to do the job hallelujah i mean
[40:59] so the same thing with you and i i mean
[41:01] the battle could be getting harder but
[41:03] that just shows the victory is getting
[41:05] nearer
[41:06] hallelujah amen so don't don't don't
[41:09] lose heart whatever
[41:11] just just don't lose heart keep your
[41:13] eyes on the promise
[41:14] amen don't worry about these
[41:16] distractions
[41:18] hallelujah amen
[41:21] now let's just go to that because
[41:25] these page numbers don't mean anything
[41:27] um let's go to psalms 23
[41:29] 5 and 6 brother andy's already gone to
[41:30] my punch line but there we go it's fine
[41:32] i'm sure there's another one somewhere
[41:34] coming up
[41:36] this is nothing like this morning i got
[41:38] the same notes pretty much but it's fine
[41:42] psalms so
[41:46] some people get in their mind that they
[41:48] need to get the devil or away before
[41:50] they can rejoice
[41:54] i'll take your silence as an
[41:56] acknowledgement of what i've just said
[41:59] you know some people think well we've
[42:00] just got to clear the devil out we've
[42:02] got to get rid of all the trouble we've
[42:03] got to get rid of all the unbelief and
[42:04] then god could move
[42:06] but i wanted i want you to notice the
[42:08] type of restaurant god sets up
[42:11] hallelujah he knows where to feed his
[42:13] children he knows where to set up a
[42:15] table
[42:16] and he sets it up in a specific place do
[42:19] we have psalms 23 right there can we can
[42:21] we
[42:21] yeah there we go amen he says now
[42:24] thou prepares a table before me in the
[42:28] presence of mine enemies so this is
[42:30] where god sets up his restaurant
[42:32] hallelujah he's going to say son and
[42:34] daughter i'm i'm putting a table right
[42:36] here
[42:37] where are you going to put this table
[42:38] god is going to be by the seaside it's
[42:40] going to be on a nice mountain or
[42:41] you know is it just going to be up in
[42:42] heaven someplace where the devils no
[42:44] more i know
[42:46] i put a real nice place where your enemy
[42:49] is where that spirit is that troubles
[42:51] you and oppresses you and comes against
[42:53] you and
[42:53] this chatter chatter and this gossip
[42:55] whatever more he puts the table
[42:57] right there hallelujah and then and then
[42:59] he comes along says i'll i'll now take
[43:01] you to your seat and you think i'm going
[43:03] to get the best seat in the restaurant
[43:04] and you walk past all the nice places
[43:06] and then
[43:06] you come to really but that guy's here
[43:09] i'm not pointing at anyone now okay i'm
[43:10] talking about spirit i'm just
[43:11] dramatizing
[43:12] you know but but that spirit's there and
[43:14] this guy that i fought with for decades
[43:16] and this one and
[43:16] and you know this spirit's here and god
[43:18] says yep eat right here
[43:21] why because he prepares a table for us
[43:24] in the presence of his enemies why
[43:26] because he wants you to eat
[43:28] he wants you to feast in a place that
[43:31] he's telling the devil devil
[43:32] these people don't care that you're
[43:34] present it doesn't affect their worship
[43:37] it doesn't bother them none it doesn't
[43:39] matter if all of hell is in this room
[43:41] right now they're going to feast they're
[43:42] going to rejoice they're going to praise
[43:44] god
[43:44] why because they are children of the
[43:46] most high god and they are
[43:48] built to eat this food this diet
[43:51] hallelujah
[43:52] hallelujah some people can't eat certain
[43:54] foods but we can eat this word
[43:56] i mean we can actually stomach this
[43:58] message harlow we're built to stomach
[43:59] this feast
[44:01] hello there's none of this there's none
[44:02] of the seven course menu that we say
[44:05] no don't like that i can't eat that it's
[44:07] just like yup how many plates can i
[44:08] carry you know
[44:10] how many stacks can i do you know
[44:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[44:14] amen so he prepares a table so we should
[44:17] never be surprised
[44:19] that the devil is there when we're
[44:21] trying to worship god we should never
[44:23] ever be surprised because god says i'm
[44:25] going to sit
[44:26] i'm going to put you in the prince of
[44:27] your enemies you're going to eat
[44:29] so we should actually expect that it's
[44:31] like some troubling thought comes in
[44:33] your mind some cold feeling some in
[44:35] different feelings
[44:36] oh you're here i knew you'd be here
[44:39] because the word says you'd be here
[44:41] hallelujah amen he says surely
[44:45] and thou anoint us my head with oil my
[44:47] cup runeth over
[44:49] so this is what's going to happen when
[44:50] we're going to feast in the presence of
[44:51] our enemy
[44:52] amen the lord is going to anoint our
[44:54] head anoint our revelation
[44:56] and the stimulation of that revelation
[44:58] is going to run over everywhere
[45:00] hallelujah say well that person is
[45:02] eating real messy no i'm just having a
[45:04] good time
[45:05] where's those table manners gone you
[45:06] don't need no table matters in this
[45:08] place
[45:09] hallelujah why because he anoints
[45:12] my head with oil and my cup runneth over
[45:15] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[45:17] me all the days of my life
[45:19] amen and i will dwell in the house of
[45:21] the lord
[45:22] forever hallelujah now it's very
[45:25] interesting i have never ever been to a
[45:27] banquet
[45:28] where where where people sit down and
[45:31] they get the maybe the starter or the
[45:33] first time they ever sample some food
[45:34] i've never ever heard someone saying a
[45:36] sarcastic or very kind of
[45:38] passive-aggressive tone well i hope
[45:40] brother so-and-so eating you know i was
[45:41] eating this today
[45:43] hope sister so-and-so is eating this one
[45:44] today i hope she gets that steak and i
[45:47] hope that
[45:47] i've never heard that normally it's i'm
[45:50] enjoying this
[45:51] or sometimes it just goes silent because
[45:53] you got no time to talk because you're
[45:54] eating
[45:55] it's only a sign of a good feast when
[45:57] everyone's actually just
[45:59] the stomach goes this way the napkin
[46:02] goes up this way
[46:04] you know but everyone's like oh this
[46:05] tastes so good and what's happening is
[46:06] they're enjoying
[46:08] the experience of eating and they're not
[46:10] really worried about oh that person
[46:12] better order this and this person better
[46:13] order that and this person better hear
[46:14] this and this person
[46:15] and they got their pitchfork out trying
[46:17] to shovel things around no i've never
[46:19] ever i've never experienced that
[46:22] hallelujah if they do say i hope so and
[46:24] so enjoys us it's out of a loving heart
[46:26] because they're enjoying it too
[46:28] hallelujah
[46:30] so i've never ever been to a ba who's
[46:32] been to a banquet like that
[46:35] that'd be an experience wouldn't it you
[46:36] know what's wrong with my table guess
[46:39] why they told me
[46:41] hallelujah now brother brown says that
[46:44] the parable of the wedding supper feast
[46:47] is a call to the pentecostal feast
[46:50] so he so so he parallels where the
[46:53] servants go out
[46:55] and eventually they have to go to the
[46:56] highways and byways and get the good and
[46:58] the bad the indifferent the whoevers the
[47:00] unlikelies
[47:01] and call them to the feast of the king
[47:03] and brother bam says that this
[47:04] is actually that parable is overlays the
[47:07] three pills of his ministry
[47:09] where the third pool gets those in the
[47:11] highways and the byways hello highways
[47:13] and byways people
[47:14] it wasn't the first pool that you know
[47:16] pulled me off the second pole that
[47:17] pulled me
[47:18] you know i read about brother brown's
[47:19] ministry you know i read perry green's
[47:21] uh biography the acts of the prophet you
[47:24] know before i became a believer and that
[47:25] you know it was amazing but it didn't
[47:26] grip my heart
[47:27] but when i heard that voice when i heard
[47:29] that voice behind the voice speaking of
[47:31] redemption and completeness and enjoy
[47:33] and
[47:33] why so many fail to keep the victory in
[47:35] the seal of god that gripped me
[47:37] why because the word was pulling
[47:39] hallelujah and it should be that same
[47:41] hour with you and i the word should be
[47:43] pulling us
[47:43] amen into a closer walk with god
[47:46] hallelujah when you hear that message
[47:47] you read the bible something he says
[47:48] lord i just want more of you
[47:50] i want less of the world lord fill me up
[47:52] you know what's cool
[47:53] you pour something into something right
[47:56] you pour a liquid into something it
[47:57] actually empties out eventually all the
[47:59] other stuff
[48:00] who's ever seen that video people say
[48:02] well you know
[48:03] you know people say it's like uh prayer
[48:05] you know but
[48:07] not always but it's like a jug of like
[48:09] red water
[48:10] and someone keeps pouring in white and
[48:12] eventually all the red water is gone
[48:14] because it's been replaced by what's
[48:16] being poured in it's the same thing with
[48:18] god you got things in your life you want
[48:21] to get rid of just let him pour himself
[48:22] in
[48:23] he'll he'll empty out everything else
[48:25] remember you can contain only so much
[48:27] hallelujah and if there's no room for
[48:29] the devil the devil ain't going to be
[48:30] there
[48:31] hallelujah if if you're filled up with
[48:34] god to be filled with the fullness of
[48:35] god so the ex
[48:36] full extent of your being is all god the
[48:38] devil has got no room
[48:40] hallelujah you know there'll be times
[48:42] when the girls were young and they'd be
[48:44] you know up in that in you know end up
[48:46] in our bed and there'll be
[48:47] christine and the three girls and then i
[48:49] would probably go yeah i'll get the
[48:50] youngest put them there and i'd look at
[48:52] the bed and say
[48:53] i have no room here why because the bed
[48:55] was full
[48:56] hallelujah it's like the devil you know
[48:58] he should come along and say can i fit
[49:00] is there anywhere i can get in you know
[49:02] i said no there's no room
[49:03] amen this place is full hallelujah with
[49:06] the goodness of god amen
[49:08] hallelujah amen he says now
[49:13] amen and her religious system is wronger
[49:16] than the moral
[49:17] she becomes in doing this she has now
[49:19] joined herself
[49:20] all these churches and of the nation
[49:22] into the federation of churches
[49:24] and has taken the mark of the beast what
[49:26] a thing why
[49:27] christ gave them the opportunity come to
[49:29] my feast the feast of pentecost which
[49:31] means 50.
[49:32] when the holy ghost poured out on russia
[49:35] they was called to a feast of pentecost
[49:37] a spiritual feast and they turned it
[49:39] down england
[49:40] the holy ghost was poured out upon them
[49:41] they turned it down america
[49:43] the holy ghost was poured out upon them
[49:45] and they turned it down
[49:47] he bit three times three times he sent
[49:49] out
[49:50] they did not listen to the feast then he
[49:52] sent again and he said go and compel
[49:55] those people to come the table has got
[49:56] to be set the table is ready there's
[49:58] still room
[49:59] and i believe that maybe within maybe
[50:01] the next few months or something or a
[50:02] year whatever it is god is going to send
[50:04] another shaking across the country
[50:06] for there is somebody still out there i
[50:09] like
[50:10] i apply this today i don't put this back
[50:12] in 1963
[50:14] and is your life worthy of the gospel i
[50:16] believe this is today
[50:17] that god is going to send out another
[50:19] shaking
[50:20] stir the water again lord step down to
[50:22] the word and stir it up that we can step
[50:24] in and get healed hallelujah i believe
[50:26] there's going to be another shaking
[50:28] amen cause there's somebody amen for
[50:31] there's somebody still out there
[50:32] somewhere that's a predestinated seed
[50:34] that the light has to fall on somewhere
[50:37] somewhere in the world the nation he
[50:38] says itself is gone
[50:40] but that individual there's still mercy
[50:42] for that person aren't you glad we say
[50:43] lord here i
[50:44] am hallelujah amen that's why the
[50:47] rapture hasn't gone because there's
[50:48] still people to come in
[50:50] glory lord help us find them amen so
[50:55] i like to eat in the presence of my
[50:57] enemy
[50:58] hallelujah i need to take this on board
[51:00] because sometimes what happens is
[51:02] you know we get a funny feeling you know
[51:05] the devil comes in
[51:06] plays with our mind troubles us feel a
[51:08] coldness oh i don't feel like praising
[51:10] god today it's the devil just trying to
[51:12] lull you off to sleep and you know
[51:14] because you know he knows
[51:15] if we get blessed enough if god falls
[51:18] upon us
[51:20] it's over for him amen hallelujah
[51:22] because remember all we need in life is
[51:24] more of god
[51:25] really it's not about mentally trying to
[51:27] figure everything out we just need more
[51:28] of him
[51:29] and if you get more of him when this
[51:31] word puts on flesh
[51:32] it goes from just intellectual and it
[51:34] actually is your god you're the form of
[51:36] the latter reign of the holy ghost falls
[51:38] the teaching and the quickening reign
[51:39] fall together
[51:40] and the word we hear becomes manifested
[51:42] in our lives we're living in that season
[51:44] it's not just teaching and teaching and
[51:46] teaching nothing much happening
[51:47] but now that quickening rain is coming
[51:49] so so what's been taught is now coming
[51:51] to life
[51:52] holy that's why we can look back just a
[51:54] few years of this little place here we
[51:56] see people have been transformed by the
[51:57] holy ghost
[51:58] why because there's been a teaching rain
[52:00] and a quickening rain running together
[52:02] hallelujah it's true isn't it
[52:06] amen so lord keep raining
[52:09] hallelujah yo some people get sick of
[52:11] the rainbow spiritually pour it on
[52:14] glory to god we won't get washed away so
[52:17] we don't need to worry about it
[52:18] hallelujah that's actually for us it's
[52:21] for our good
[52:22] amen so hallelujah
[52:25] now we have to be very aware
[52:29] well as i was saying before the enemy
[52:32] comes along
[52:33] makes us feel a certain way and we react
[52:35] or we worship or we walk with god
[52:37] according to him the devil
[52:39] because that's what the devil wants the
[52:41] devil wants to be worshipped
[52:43] now i'm not talking about literally
[52:44] bowing down and worshiping the devil but
[52:46] i'm talking about the effect of him his
[52:48] influence comes into our lives in subtle
[52:50] ways
[52:51] and we start to look at one another we
[52:52] look at even the word a certain way
[52:54] we look at ourselves our salvation a
[52:56] certain way because of what the devil's
[52:58] trying to put in our lives the blood is
[53:00] more than enough
[53:02] our salvation was without money or price
[53:05] salvation is not based on feeling
[53:07] it's not based on how happy you are the
[53:09] rapture will not be
[53:10] when we all get to a state of nirvana
[53:12] and everything's fine
[53:14] as i've said well i said it at the camp
[53:16] you know you take the two on the way to
[53:18] emmaus all the disciples in luke 24
[53:20] which was a prophecy
[53:21] these modern events today are made clear
[53:23] by the prophecy which is in luke 24
[53:25] luke 24 is a prophecy who's heard me say
[53:28] this i'm sure you have
[53:29] yes so so the condition of the believers
[53:31] in luke 24 is prophesying
[53:33] of a people that will be here at the
[53:34] second coming
[53:36] they're not skipping they're not jumping
[53:38] they're not shouting
[53:40] until they meet the law that is but but
[53:42] they think their whole world has fallen
[53:44] apart
[53:45] the two on the way to emmaus are
[53:46] brokenhearted they're down they're
[53:48] walking back to emmaus
[53:49] and the resurrected one the resurrection
[53:51] and the life is walking right with them
[53:53] opening the scripture to them and
[53:55] they're broken-hearted
[53:58] i need to be happy enough to receive a
[53:59] revelation those people were receiving
[54:01] revelation they were brokenhearted
[54:03] you're following me but then they walked
[54:06] but the lord walked with them
[54:08] in that state and then he revealed
[54:11] himself and the reason he revealed
[54:12] himself
[54:13] wasn't that they would know that he just
[54:15] resurrected but that they were part of
[54:17] the resurrection
[54:19] same thing with the message you know we
[54:20] can walk along we can be broke who's
[54:22] ever been ministered to by the lord when
[54:24] you're brokenhearted
[54:25] he's dying to the brokenhearted right so
[54:28] you we don't have to be all happy that
[54:29] we can worship we can we can worship
[54:31] when we're broken-hearted
[54:33] we can praise him when we're
[54:34] broken-hearted i mean so there they were
[54:36] walking along broken-hearted
[54:38] but then he was revealing himself to
[54:40] them because he wanted them to see
[54:42] that they were part of that resurrection
[54:44] because if i live you shall live also
[54:46] same thing he walks with you
[54:48] irrespective of how you're feeling
[54:50] because he wants you to realize you're
[54:52] part of the resurrection
[54:53] that's why the message comes your way i
[54:56] mean so
[54:57] don't beat yourself up for for feeling
[54:59] beaten up
[55:02] don't beat yourself up or feeling down
[55:03] you say well i've been feeling this way
[55:04] a long time there's another morning
[55:07] hallelujah it may be a while but you
[55:10] know seasons always change
[55:12] but who's walking with you who's
[55:14] ministering to you
[55:16] that's god i'll help you out with that
[55:19] answer it's the lord himself
[55:20] the lord walks with his children
[55:23] irrespective of how they're feeling
[55:25] and says look i'm going to minister my
[55:27] word i'm going to pour myself into you
[55:29] but now i'm going to make your eyes come
[55:30] open and you'll see the one walking with
[55:32] you is the one who's going to rapture
[55:34] you
[55:34] ha lucas brother braham said that
[55:36] there's a man standing prison that'll
[55:37] rapture his church
[55:39] hallelujah i like what brother isaac
[55:41] said in that um surveillance
[55:42] sermon you know basically we're like a
[55:44] secret agent we get put in
[55:46] but but but we get told don't worry if
[55:48] it gets too hot i'll pull you out
[55:50] holy i like that that was awesome
[55:52] because that's what the lord's going to
[55:53] do
[55:54] hallelujah amen
[56:00] now hallelujah
[56:03] brother ram said and he swore by himself
[56:06] and you're here
[56:07] the word must be fulfilled and he and he
[56:10] knowed
[56:11] what his life was to fulfill them that's
[56:13] right and you're here to fulfill it too
[56:15] just walk unconscious of fear now he's
[56:17] giving us real good instructions how to
[56:19] walk
[56:20] walk unconscious of criticism walk on
[56:23] conscience
[56:23] i mean unconscious unto the world
[56:26] walk as you walk in christ walk with him
[56:29] not paying any attention the right or
[56:31] the left hand just keep
[56:32] keep moving on if something comes up in
[56:35] the church walk with god
[56:37] hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk
[56:39] with god
[56:40] if the neighbor don't like you walk with
[56:42] god just keep on walking with
[56:44] god enoch one day walk like that i mean
[56:47] so
[56:47] so so the prophet's telling me enoch had
[56:50] trouble in his church
[56:51] he had sickness he had trouble in his
[56:54] family amen but he just kept walking on
[56:56] with god
[56:57] i mean the enoch one day walk like that
[56:59] you know what he'd done he walked all
[57:01] the way home with god
[57:02] got so far up the road he didn't want to
[57:04] come back anymore
[57:06] amen walk with god doctor says you're
[57:08] going to die walk with god
[57:10] yeah doctor says you can't walk with god
[57:12] just walk with god that's all
[57:13] for god has promised you i'll never
[57:15] leave you nor forsake you
[57:17] i'll be with you to the end of the world
[57:18] and he took an oath by that covenant
[57:20] that he give you
[57:21] that he would confirm it just walk with
[57:23] god then
[57:24] you'll have your ups and downs don't
[57:26] worry
[57:27] you've got to go through briar patches
[57:29] over sharp rocks
[57:30] over bluffs down over the hillsides up
[57:33] through the mountains over waters but
[57:35] walk with god yes sir there's so many
[57:38] hills to climb upward
[57:40] we've heard the old song but how little
[57:42] scene
[57:43] when you get to the end of the way my my
[57:46] just look at them
[57:48] it's all been back look back at your
[57:51] footprints they won't be very
[57:53] much so just walk with god
[57:56] he does never say sit down and figure
[57:58] everything out just walk with god
[58:01] walk on with god hallelujah
[58:05] amen this is what we're going to do
[58:06] friends let's just keep walking on with
[58:08] god
[58:11] you know as brother brown would say
[58:13] about if you want to see the
[58:14] old-fashioned meetings again
[58:16] just become a lamb just become lambs
[58:20] again that's all just get back to being
[58:23] sheep
[58:24] the dove hasn't gone very far he's just
[58:26] waiting a chance to get back
[58:28] there's a road back to azusa street
[58:30] there's a place back back to the azusa
[58:32] street meetings again is to return
[58:34] to a lamb nature again so what
[58:38] what that means is basically all the
[58:40] trouble the devil's tried to put down
[58:42] your throat and tried to get you to
[58:43] react a certain way
[58:45] you put it under the blood
[58:48] so if someone you have some spirits come
[58:50] along and try to treat you bad put it
[58:52] under the blood
[58:53] someone's mistreated you put it under
[58:55] the blood
[58:56] just put all those things under the
[58:57] blood and also we're going to keep
[58:59] yeah we're going to remember who we're
[59:00] walking with
[59:03] i'm walking with god it's just me and
[59:05] jesus
[59:06] there's only room for two on this road
[59:08] me and him
[59:09] together three is a crap two's a company
[59:12] three is a crowd
[59:13] and the devil makes it a crowd
[59:15] hallelujah
[59:16] complexes make it a crowd pain makes it
[59:19] a crowd
[59:20] unforgiveness makes it a crowd funny
[59:22] feelings makes it a crowd
[59:23] formality makes it a crowd they can't
[59:25] fit on the road and i'm not falling off
[59:27] the cliff they're getting off
[59:29] amen hallelujah because it's because me
[59:32] and jesus walking no one else is welcome
[59:35] i'm talking about spirits hey come on
[59:36] with you know what i mean because it's
[59:38] because remember christianity is an
[59:39] individual walk
[59:40] when we stand before the lord either
[59:42] before the judgment seat of christ you
[59:44] receive rewards
[59:46] or we are at the white throne judgment
[59:48] being judged and i pray with all my
[59:49] heart
[59:49] none of us are in that category it's not
[59:52] going to be me
[59:53] and say my wife there it's going to be
[59:56] me and god it's not going to even be me
[59:57] and you there
[59:59] when i give an account my own life it'll
[1:00:01] be me
[1:00:02] and him that's why that's why it's an
[1:00:05] individual affair just walk with god
[1:00:07] he'll see you through hallelujah
[1:00:12] amen now what i love about
[1:00:15] i love so much about the scripture you
[1:00:18] know what i love about the old testament
[1:00:19] yeah i'm glad the bible's made for boys
[1:00:22] you know it's made you know it's made
[1:00:23] for well you know girls but it's made
[1:00:25] for boys
[1:00:26] i love the old testament all the all the
[1:00:27] all the sword fighting and the killing
[1:00:29] and the wars and the
[1:00:30] you know sorry maybe i've got a violent
[1:00:32] streak i know but but i enjoy the
[1:00:33] heroism of it
[1:00:35] because it wasn't it wasn't hollywood
[1:00:38] it wasn't theatrics these are real men
[1:00:42] these are real men hallelujah and what i
[1:00:45] love about it now maybe i'll actually
[1:00:46] get to my title
[1:00:48] um he cares for those who care
[1:00:52] and brother brown says and he cares do
[1:00:54] you care
[1:00:56] he says if you're ready to confess and
[1:00:58] repent and believe and accept god
[1:01:00] cares but you've got to care first
[1:01:02] you've got to accept what he sent you
[1:01:05] he so cared for them that they'd be sure
[1:01:08] that there would be no mistake he
[1:01:09] vindicated his prophet by a sign of a
[1:01:11] pillar of fire
[1:01:13] to let the people see that it wasn't
[1:01:14] just this man walking
[1:01:17] along here that it was god right above
[1:01:20] him he was the one that was leading the
[1:01:22] way
[1:01:23] god cares for people who cares god
[1:01:26] cares for those who care for him amen so
[1:01:30] so he cares for those who care
[1:01:32] hallelujah
[1:01:33] and and i'm sure that's the reason we
[1:01:35] are here tonight is not because well
[1:01:36] it's a wednesday and this is what it's
[1:01:38] in my schedule
[1:01:39] but but we're here because we care we
[1:01:42] care for the lord we want to see his
[1:01:43] word manifested we want to see his word
[1:01:46] come to pass
[1:01:47] amen and what i love about those who
[1:01:49] care is those who care it's an
[1:01:51] individual that cares it's not a group
[1:01:54] thing
[1:01:54] it's only a group thing if the other
[1:01:56] people care the same as the individual
[1:01:58] i mean so so brother brown dramatizes
[1:02:02] moses's parents and amram
[1:02:05] was the father of moses and he would he
[1:02:08] was a slave like all the other slaves he
[1:02:10] was a
[1:02:10] he was a hebrew like they all were
[1:02:12] circumcised believer
[1:02:14] but he had a burden because the word was
[1:02:16] about to be fulfilled a deliverer is
[1:02:18] going to come
[1:02:19] and he was determined if no one else was
[1:02:22] going to pray he was going to pray
[1:02:24] because he cared that god's word would
[1:02:26] be fulfilled in his day
[1:02:28] and and and his wife johan would say to
[1:02:30] him you know honey you're all beat up
[1:02:32] you got beat up like everyone else there
[1:02:33] and there's
[1:02:34] you had a real tough day and your slave
[1:02:36] masters were all mean to you
[1:02:37] you know you don't need to go up and
[1:02:38] pray why don't you let someone else pray
[1:02:40] but he says what if no one else prays
[1:02:43] amen i'm gonna be the one who prays
[1:02:44] through and he's and he kept seeking god
[1:02:46] night after night oh great jehovah god
[1:02:49] when's the delivery going to come why
[1:02:50] because he cared
[1:02:52] amen and god looked down and says this
[1:02:54] is one that cares for me i'll show my
[1:02:55] care for him
[1:02:56] and that deliverer will be birthed right
[1:02:58] into his house hallelujah
[1:03:00] amen why because he cared he wasn't
[1:03:03] waiting for the rest of the church to
[1:03:05] care he cared first
[1:03:07] hallelujah and that's why it's an
[1:03:09] individual thing do you care if you care
[1:03:11] he cares
[1:03:12] amen if you care and he cares for you
[1:03:14] he'll fulfill
[1:03:15] his promises to you in your life
[1:03:17] hallelujah and that's what we want to
[1:03:19] see
[1:03:19] don't want to see god's word fulfilled
[1:03:21] amen the woman with the alabaster box
[1:03:23] cared
[1:03:25] hallelujah when she saw jesus unwelcome
[1:03:27] in the feast of simon the pharisee
[1:03:29] amen with unwashed feet not made welcome
[1:03:32] and she saw look through the window
[1:03:34] she cared amen she said it's wrong for
[1:03:36] him to be left i mean
[1:03:38] not made welcome in that place and it's
[1:03:40] the same thing amen when we come to
[1:03:42] church we should never leave jesus
[1:03:44] with unwashed feet unwelcome i remember
[1:03:46] we should give such a worship that lord
[1:03:48] jesus you are the most welcome person
[1:03:50] other you're the guest of guests that we
[1:03:52] want to see in our lives
[1:03:54] hallelujah and she cared she didn't ask
[1:03:57] everyone else

[1:03:59] sisters what are we going to do about
[1:04:00] this here he is with unwashed feet you
[1:04:02] know
[1:04:02] she didn't go excuse me simon the
[1:04:04] pharisee um you overlooked someone
[1:04:06] he was overlooked on purpose by the way
[1:04:09] i mean so so but she cared enough she
[1:04:12] took all of her earnings
[1:04:13] and then she bought the best perfume
[1:04:15] somehow she got through there past the
[1:04:17] footwash flanking the robo and
[1:04:18] different ones and got right to his feet
[1:04:20] and she cared enough she didn't even ask
[1:04:22] permission she just poured her life out
[1:04:24] at his feet
[1:04:26] hallelujah and because she cared he
[1:04:28] cared
[1:04:30] though her sins be white as scarlet
[1:04:32] hallelujah they're all forgiven go and
[1:04:34] sin no more
[1:04:36] hallelujah why because she cared
[1:04:39] now going back to my old testament i
[1:04:41] love fighting i mean swords and you know
[1:04:43] i like i mean i was a boy once too you
[1:04:45] know
[1:04:47] i love those kind of things anyway
[1:04:50] heroes and real heroes amen
[1:04:54] david had three mighty men he had other
[1:04:57] mighty men but there were three
[1:04:59] and david would be standing there and
[1:05:01] he'd be in his cave or his
[1:05:03] wherever he was he was an outcast that
[1:05:05] time a future of an israel
[1:05:07] and and maybe on the horizon he could
[1:05:09] see bethel here maybe he's up on the
[1:05:10] hills he saw it down in the valley
[1:05:12] and he just expressed a desire he said
[1:05:15] oh if i could just drink of those
[1:05:17] cool waters from the well of bethlehem
[1:05:18] again and no doubt you know the
[1:05:21] scripture doesn't say he just said it to
[1:05:22] these three but maybe he just there's a
[1:05:24] whole bunch of them in the camp he just
[1:05:25] expressed the desire
[1:05:27] but because those three cared the
[1:05:30] smallest of a desire from
[1:05:32] david was a great commandment to them so
[1:05:34] because they cared they said boys we're
[1:05:36] going to get him a fresh drink
[1:05:38] they did not ask all the others are you
[1:05:40] coming with
[1:05:41] they didn't ask the rest of the church
[1:05:42] are you going to come get him are you
[1:05:44] going to get your king a fresh drink of
[1:05:45] water
[1:05:46] amen but they got their swords they got
[1:05:48] their bucket and they begin to cut
[1:05:50] through 15 miles of philistines
[1:05:52] hallelujah
[1:05:53] why because they cared amen and the
[1:05:55] devil tries to garrison every promise
[1:05:57] from us
[1:05:58] he tries to garrison even the blessings
[1:06:00] in a church service away from us
[1:06:02] if he can he'll ward that off that we'll
[1:06:04] go out the worst way we came in
[1:06:06] brother even says that the people can
[1:06:08] leave service in a worser condition than
[1:06:10] when they came
[1:06:11] and we never want to fall into that
[1:06:13] category we want to be better
[1:06:15] every time we step through these doors
[1:06:17] every time we open the scripture every
[1:06:19] time we pray we want to be in a better
[1:06:20] spiritual condition now
[1:06:21] i'm not talking about your emotional
[1:06:23] state i'm talking about your spiritual
[1:06:25] condition which is two very different
[1:06:27] things sometimes
[1:06:28] i mean as i said you can be filled down
[1:06:29] in the dumps but spiritually he can be
[1:06:31] hallelujah
[1:06:32] it is well with my soul that's how we
[1:06:34] want to be amen today so they took their
[1:06:36] weapons
[1:06:37] and they cut through all those
[1:06:38] philistines because they cared enough
[1:06:41] that david's desire was a great
[1:06:43] commandment to them
[1:06:44] hallelujah and they break through the
[1:06:46] philistine host and they got him a drink
[1:06:48] amen and they returned with it
[1:06:50] hallelujah so they cut through all doubt
[1:06:54] because we're mighty men too hallelujah
[1:06:57] those philistines had an expiry date on
[1:06:59] them they were not willing to let those
[1:07:01] philistines stand between them and the
[1:07:03] goal
[1:07:04] amen if one got in their way he was
[1:07:06] going to die i don't know maybe they
[1:07:08] said hey
[1:07:09] philistines if you don't want to end up
[1:07:10] like those guys
[1:07:12] get out of my way devil if you don't
[1:07:14] want to end up like those other devils
[1:07:16] get out of my way
[1:07:17] hallelujah all the other victories that
[1:07:19] god has given us in the past if you
[1:07:20] don't want to end up like that get out
[1:07:21] of my way because i'm coming through
[1:07:24] hallelujah i mean so they cut through
[1:07:26] all doubt
[1:07:27] yeah the devil comes comes along says is
[1:07:29] that really true
[1:07:31] yes it's true the bible says it's true
[1:07:33] he says oh no
[1:07:34] you can't really have that who said come
[1:07:36] on the scripture says whosoever will let
[1:07:39] them come
[1:07:40] if you've got a willing heart doesn't
[1:07:41] matter your condition that's what i love
[1:07:43] about the
[1:07:44] you know you're the parable of the of
[1:07:45] the feast is yo yo the king says get the
[1:07:48] good and the bad
[1:07:49] hallelujah so i fell in one of those
[1:07:51] camps that was fine i don't care if i
[1:07:53] was bad or good i came
[1:07:55] hallelujah amen so they cut through all
[1:07:58] doubt
[1:07:58] they cut through all ill feelings they
[1:08:01] cut through all and
[1:08:02] um unforgiveness they cut through all
[1:08:04] formality
[1:08:05] i mean because they were determined amen
[1:08:07] to get
[1:08:08] get that king a fresh drink harley and
[1:08:11] noah and if no one else was gonna do the
[1:08:13] job
[1:08:14] amen but they decided to do the job amen
[1:08:16] that's why when we can come to church
[1:08:19] hallelujah and we can cut through all
[1:08:20] formality you know you know the devil
[1:08:22] says oh there'll be half an hour of
[1:08:23] singing
[1:08:24] and this and this and this brother will
[1:08:25] do this this sister will do this this is
[1:08:26] how
[1:08:27] and that pastor does this and yeah cut
[1:08:29] through all that amen
[1:08:30] hallelujah and then oh well it's going
[1:08:31] to finish soon and watch for lunch cut
[1:08:33] through that trouble
[1:08:34] i mean oh this person did this to me and
[1:08:36] this spirit's here and this troubles
[1:08:37] here who cares
[1:08:38] the tables and the presence of mine
[1:08:40] enemies hallelujah
[1:08:42] i mean in the presence of the devil
[1:08:44] that's where i feast
[1:08:45] hallelujah at least they cut through
[1:08:49] everything until they got to the well
[1:08:52] hallelujah
[1:08:53] and then brother ram says and why little
[1:08:54] bethlehem he says
[1:08:57] who warrior can see the millennium
[1:08:59] coming can we not see the millennium
[1:09:01] coming
[1:09:02] amen what warrior can see this great
[1:09:04] holy spirit come in the form of jesus
[1:09:06] christ the literal person
[1:09:07] of christ to take over stand with me who
[1:09:10] sees him coming to take over
[1:09:12] where is he going to take over you and i
[1:09:13] first amen the kingdom of god is within
[1:09:16] you
[1:09:16] hallelujah amen stand by me let's cut a
[1:09:19] hole through
[1:09:20] this denominational creed what's a
[1:09:22] denominational creed adding or taking
[1:09:24] from the word to make
[1:09:26] to make god leave the church
[1:09:29] we can do that with the message some
[1:09:31] people have
[1:09:33] and but i've got news for you we're here
[1:09:36] to see this live
[1:09:38] that's why we're christians we want to
[1:09:39] see jesus living
[1:09:41] hallelujah amen stand with me stand by
[1:09:44] me let's cut a hole through this
[1:09:46] denominational creed let's get in there
[1:09:48] he's crying for a good fresh drink of
[1:09:50] pentecostal water
[1:09:51] original pentecost not a bunch of
[1:09:53] carrying on screaming hollering here
[1:09:55] i mean a genuine holy spirit baptism
[1:09:57] that produces the life of christ back
[1:09:59] into the person
[1:10:00] hallelujah so we can cut through you
[1:10:02] just think about the atmosphere one of
[1:10:04] us could make
[1:10:05] hallelujah where we can so move the
[1:10:07] heart of god
[1:10:08] that just like blind bartimaeus jesus
[1:10:10] stands still and says what do my
[1:10:12] children need in that place right now
[1:10:15] holy you can produce an atmosphere
[1:10:16] around you that god you know
[1:10:18] the angels stand and they watch us
[1:10:19] worship because they can't join into our
[1:10:22] worship because they've never been
[1:10:23] redeemed
[1:10:24] they've never been lost i'm talking
[1:10:25] about the ones who haven't fallen and
[1:10:26] there's no blood for them they can never
[1:10:28] be redeemed
[1:10:28] so we talk about i am reading i
[1:10:32] you know by the blood of the lamb and
[1:10:34] they could maybe sing it from here
[1:10:37] but never from here because they've
[1:10:38] never experienced that hallelujah
[1:10:40] so so they can watch us worship and no
[1:10:43] doubt they get excited by that
[1:10:45] in some form but then god says no no i
[1:10:47] can't just watch it i want to step into
[1:10:49] that worship
[1:10:50] hallelujah because god inhabits the
[1:10:52] praises of his people
[1:10:53] i mean so when we begin to praise god
[1:10:55] irrespective of how we feel
[1:10:57] and the day and the year and the decade
[1:10:59] we may have had but we come into the
[1:11:01] house of god and give them praise
[1:11:02] and then god says i'm i'm not just going
[1:11:05] to watch that amen i'm going to step
[1:11:06] into that worship
[1:11:08] and then when god comes amen that's when
[1:11:10] the battles won that's when the victory
[1:11:12] is won i mean when he comes good things
[1:11:14] always happen
[1:11:15] i believe he's present tonight don't you
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] amen so they cut through all these
[1:11:21] things he says
[1:11:23] this isn't why little bethlehem as well
[1:11:24] so just think of the potential you're
[1:11:26] we're a powerhouse one one man is a
[1:11:29] majority with god one man or one woman
[1:11:31] they're a majority we don't need a whole
[1:11:32] bunch just one
[1:11:34] moses was one john the baptist was one
[1:11:36] jesus was one
[1:11:38] hallelujah amen elijah was one
[1:11:41] one is the majority you know i love it
[1:11:44] you know
[1:11:45] you think about i like to dramatize
[1:11:47] things but you just think about you know
[1:11:49] gehazi takes the milk bottles brother
[1:11:51] ram says out to the front gate
[1:11:53] and he doesn't know that in the night
[1:11:55] time all that rustling outside was
[1:11:56] actually the assyrians and camping
[1:11:58] around the city
[1:11:59] and you know he goes to put the milk
[1:12:01] balls out and he looks up and he just
[1:12:03] starts shaking in his boots
[1:12:05] and he runs back now this is just me
[1:12:07] this is probably totally out of it but
[1:12:08] you know
[1:12:09] he runs back to elisha shakes him in bed
[1:12:11] elisha wake up wake up we're going to
[1:12:13] die
[1:12:14] you know i think elisha just what you
[1:12:17] know
[1:12:18] we're surrounded by the armies of
[1:12:20] syrians no this is not how does in the
[1:12:22] scripture but it's just me
[1:12:23] and maybe just prayed lord open his eyes
[1:12:27] rolls back to bed you know and then he
[1:12:30] sees it that
[1:12:31] that because elisha and gehazi cared
[1:12:34] god kid and because they cared the
[1:12:37] armies of heaven were camped around them
[1:12:40] hallelujah hallelujah so we don't need
[1:12:43] to worry about anything
[1:12:45] but you think about how there's that
[1:12:46] there's there's the prophet
[1:12:48] all the armies are around that prophet
[1:12:50] he moves here the armies move
[1:12:52] he goes here the armies move hallelujah
[1:12:55] we go here the armies of heaven move and
[1:12:57] we go over here the armies of heaven
[1:12:59] move
[1:12:59] well because god is god is with us and
[1:13:01] he's waiting for us to call him on the
[1:13:03] scene
[1:13:04] i mean because he's not a god of history
[1:13:05] he's god of the present but he's looking
[1:13:07] for people to call them
[1:13:09] into action you know from a god out of
[1:13:11] history as a god into action
[1:13:14] hallelujah amen amen
[1:13:19] hallelujah i'll just read this quote and
[1:13:20] then and then the music the musicians
[1:13:22] can you please come
[1:13:24] he says forgive me if i hurt you no
[1:13:26] don't you do it i'm doing this in the
[1:13:28] name of the lord jesus
[1:13:29] come back stand you gallant men who see
[1:13:32] david standing you under jesus christ a
[1:13:34] future from his church
[1:13:35] bought out by their creeds there's a
[1:13:37] fresh fountain hanging
[1:13:39] onto amen there's a power to make this
[1:13:41] world live again
[1:13:43] hallelujah i mean it's prophesied in
[1:13:45] this day to come to pass
[1:13:47] god said it would come to pass it's got
[1:13:49] to come to pass
[1:13:50] you'll never do it in the army you're in
[1:13:52] now you'll garrison yourself pentecost
[1:13:55] right around with the rest of the
[1:13:56] organizations cutting
[1:13:57] it into a creed so if the devil's pushed
[1:14:00] us off the line
[1:14:03] that's the wrong army we're going to be
[1:14:05] in this army and this is the army we're
[1:14:07] born to be in
[1:14:10] amen now oh men of god where's that
[1:14:14] sword
[1:14:14] our lord desires a fresh drink i don't
[1:14:17] care if it's life or death let's cut
[1:14:19] through this thing
[1:14:20] it's so hard standing by yourself i'm
[1:14:22] calling for men to stand by me
[1:14:25] stand with the word what that word says
[1:14:27] do it just the way the word said
[1:14:29] i don't care what any any anything else
[1:14:32] says
[1:14:32] stay with it that way for that's the
[1:14:35] only thing that will cut
[1:14:36] i mean let's go to bethlehem the true
[1:14:38] water of god
[1:14:40] if a man abided me an eye on him if you
[1:14:42] abided me in my words and you're abiding
[1:14:44] not just jumping from place to place and
[1:14:45] swapping
[1:14:46] your fellowship card from oneness to
[1:14:48] tunis and threeness and back to a
[1:14:49] presbyterian lutheran
[1:14:51] i you abide in me and he is the word my
[1:14:54] words abide in you
[1:14:55] don't be afraid of 800 or 8 million i'll
[1:14:58] stand by your side
[1:14:59] i desire to drink from that well again
[1:15:02] god's got to have a people that will
[1:15:03] drink from that well hallelujah
[1:15:05] you may think i'm crazy maybe i am then
[1:15:08] i'm crazy about jesus christ
[1:15:10] and his word if i have to be called a
[1:15:12] full let me be cool to fall for his word
[1:15:14] i have never been against the men in
[1:15:16] them organizations i'm against that
[1:15:18] system that's bowing the word of god out
[1:15:20] let's cut warriors stand by us let's go
[1:15:22] into that well
[1:15:23] here is our bethlehem hallelujah
[1:15:27] hallelujah amen mighty gentile warriors

[1:15:32] puts in our path with the word of god we
[1:15:34] don't have to let it stay between us and
[1:15:36] the blessing we can cut through every
[1:15:37] promise
[1:15:38] i mean cut through to every promise
[1:15:39] rather hallelujah

[1:15:46] cast all your distractions upon him
[1:15:49] because he cares for you everything the
[1:15:51] devil has done and tries to do it's a
[1:15:53] distraction
[1:15:55] so take it cast it upon the lord because
[1:15:58] he cares for you amen can we have the
