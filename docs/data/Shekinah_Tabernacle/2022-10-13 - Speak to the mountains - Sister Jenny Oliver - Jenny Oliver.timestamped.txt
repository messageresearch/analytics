[0:02] why would I worry when Giants come
[0:06] calling my name
[0:11] my God is so much bigger than troubles I
[0:16] face

[0:25] or fame
[0:30] my God is so much better than all of
[0:35] these things
[0:37] [Music]
[0:39] I Won't Be Shaken
[0:44] I won't be moved

[1:04] it's time to move
[1:09] cause my God is bigger better stronger
[1:15] greater than you
