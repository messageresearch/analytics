It's good to be um it's good to be in a place where we feel at home where we can experience the spirit of God because as sons and daughters of God, there's a song that I believe it says, "This world is not my home. I'm just passing through." So, we're I don't know if you've noticed in your life, but you know, we [music] like a cold a dark atmosphere we're not really familiar with. It doesn't we don't really feel at home. [music] And this world is full of that. It's full of you know, can be full of negative or dark atmospheres. But when we get in the atmosphere of the spirit of [music] God, then we feel at home. It's like this is me. This is where I belong. This is this is me. This is this is where I'm comfortable. And that's what we want this morning is we [music] want the spirit of God to come in our midst and and just move in a supernatural way and create the atmosphere where we we feel at home, you know, where we can just relax and we can we can be also in an atmosphere of faith, not in an atmosphere of, you know, we and we we think about things during the week and all these other things, but you know, we want to get in an atmosphere of faith. Faith where like when brother Ben speaks, we're not it's not just, oh, we're naturally looking at a guy and he's going up here and talking about a few things. We we've got a whole different perspective. we we're we're approaching by faith and we're [music] we're receiving from the spirit of God and the spirit of God's moving and speaking through him and the word of God's going forth and it's going into our heart and changing us and everything. It's just there's a it's a whole different realm that we're that we enter into. So [music] that's that's the that's what we're that's what we're approaching this morning.

So, we just want to come this [music] morning. We know that you you always desire to meet with us. And we we desire so much and you would just dwell with us um this morning, Lord, that you said we're two or three gathered in your name. There you are in the midst. So we thank you so much that you're here by your spirit, Lord. And we just pray you'd bless the service in a powerful way. May you just anoint the songs, anoint the preaching, anoint each heart, Lord.

Andy Bronny the children, God bless you. Amen. Great to have you home. Amen. Sister Marty, God bless you. Great to have you. Welcome. Amen. Mom and dad, God bless you, John. The the one and only.

Have a good old family time. It's really good. Amen. So, God bless you all. Amen. Great to have everyone here. Amen. Just a reminder, there's no uh service this Wednesday, so Christmas Eve. So, but we'll be back on Sunday. Um let's go to um Wait, I got to go here, don't I? Yeah, that's working. Okay, brilliant. Let's take Yes, we're going to go in the scripture. Amen to um we're going to go to Luke chapter 2 and we're going to read verses 25-30. Amen. All right. So, Luke uh Luke 2:25-30. We got it here. Yep. It says here, "And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him, and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ." And he came by the spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law, then he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,"Lord, now let us thou uh thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for th for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." Praise the Lord. Amen. So let's um let's bow our heads in word of prayer. If you want to be remembered in prayer, say, "Lord, come by my way today." Amen. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you, Lord. we can have this grand opportunity to lift up your great name to praise you give you glory give you thanks cuz you are the mighty God Lord we thank you father for your great mercy Lord this day I just pray as we've read your word may anchor it into our hearts may it bring forth hundfold and may you speak to all of our lives Lord meet all of our needs both here Lord and those who are streaming we commit our lives into your hands cover us in your blood Lord forgive us for our sins and our wrongs in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amend bless you can all have your seats uh this morning. So I want to um speak on I want to speak on expectations. Amen. I just love I just love these kind of pictures, you know, here here, you know, you you get what you expect, okay? Like brother Bram tells a story there there was a lady one night, you know, there's a big mountain by her house and she and she prayed one night and said, "Lord, remove the mountain." You know, and she gets up the next day, opens the blind, sees the mountain, says, "Well, I expected that." you know, just there and well, she got what she expected. Basically, she didn't actually expect the mountain to move, you see. But you see, but we get what we expect. And I'm so thankful the Lord's put a faith in our hearts to expect the as as he says, maybe I think it's my last scripture, but we but I never stay, you know. But he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that workketh workketh in us. this um sorry this monitor's okay that's fine well I can just yeah okay sweeter so you know he can we can do he can do above abundantly exceedingly abundantly more than we can ask or think so that's not just a little bit more see my experience with the Lord I'm sure it's yours is he doesn't just meet your expectation he just blows it out of the water he takes it he takes it to the stratosphere he goes far beyond and you know but you know but the Lord has given us faith that we can have an expectation Because in this Christmas season, we understand that, you know, it's a great tradition to gather and, you know, we're looking, you know, people, well, it's really Santa Claus has taken over the whole thing. But, you know, for the believer, Amen. We can have this holiday season to thank the Lord that he he was born. Amen. That the word became flesh to redeem us. Amen. And we can just rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord, for the gift of eternal life." Amen. That we didn't have to earn. We didn't have to buy it. Salvation is without money or price. Amen. But our Lord is so merciful and great. Amen. Because he knew that none of us could earn it. None of us could buy it. What could we ever give of ourselves that could merit eternal life? So, he knew that we couldn't do it. So, he says, "I'm just going to give it to you." Amen. So, there's such power in in this gift that God's given us. Now, an expectation, Webster tells us, is an act or state of expecting. It's an anticipation. It's something expected and it's a basis for expecting. It's an assurance. And when God begins to move, amen, when you know, you know, I'm sure we can all think back in our lives where God was just a story, but then he became a reality. Amen. He became a living God. And you begin to see him fulfill his word in your life. And the spirit of God moves. He pours out his power and demonstrates his great ability. And what does it do? That increases your expectation because it, you know, to begin with, it's a can he do it? You know, we read he can and I believe he can, but then he does. And it just throws us into such a great expectation because we've seen him do, you know, we've seen him do great things and it and and and it increases our expectation for him to do more. I'm going to be using that word expectation a lot today. Okay? So, but I trust we're all living under a great expectation that God in this day is fulfilling his word and he's fulfilling it in our lives. Amen. Not just somewhere, you know, I'm so glad our God did not die when the prophet died, but that same mighty angel, the Lord Jesus Christ, is present in 2025, and he'll be with us in 2026. Amen. And he will continue to prove his word. He'll continue to manifest his power. Amen. And I believe this puts us under great expectation. Now, you take for example Simeon there in the temple. The Lord told him he wasn't going to die until he saw the Lord's Christ. Now, for everyone else, you know, probably onlookers would say he's just a crazy old man and he's lost his marbles, but actually he found his marbles. Because when the Lord reveals to you his word, it gives you vision. It gives you purpose. It gives you the right thinking in any situation that you can walk through whatever you're going through with clarity because why? You're now under expectation that what the Lord has promised you in that moment is going to be fulfilled. Amen. So others would say, "Simeon, you're crazy. You think you're going to see the Messiah." We've been waiting thousands of years for the Messiah Simeon. It's been 400 years since Malachi. You know, you know, there's nothing been going on. And you think of all people, you're going to see it. But you see, to him, he knew it was going to happen because it was an expectation by the Holy Ghost. And anything God uh quickens you by his word. You can have assurance that God will fulfill that expectation. Amen. It's not some empty hope so. It's a no because it's according to his word. And I'm so thankful that we can walk through life under great expectation because when God gives us a promise, we know he's more than able to fulfill it. Amen. So everyone thought he was crazy, but he knew he wasn't crazy. Amen. And then in the right season, Amen. when Mary and Joseph came into the temple, Amen. Then what you know, Simeon's there in the temple and the Holy Spirit speaks to him and says, "Get up, Simeon. What I promised you is now going to be fulfilled." Amen. the expectation I've given you, I'm not going to leave it just as an expectation, but it's going to be a fulfilled expectation. Amen. So, the Holy Spirit led him through all those line of women dedicating their babies right to where Jesus Christ was, and he lifted him up and said, "Now I can depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." Praise the Lord. And I'm sure we can all rejoice knowing. Amen. Because God placed that expectation in Simeon's life because God was going to fulfill it in his life. Now God has expectation that his word is going to be fulfilled. God has supreme confidence that his word is going to be fulfilled. Like for example when he spoke in the beginning let there be light. He wasn't guessing is light going to form or how's it going to you know manifest itself. He knew exactly how that light what light was going to be. He knew exactly what it was going to do because he when he spoke he believed his own word and it came to pass. And as the Lord was saying in Isaiah 55, he says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven, and returneth not hither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth in bud, that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater, so shall my word that uh be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void." Amen. But it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where two I sent it. Amen. So God is under expectation. His word that he sent forth, he knows and believes and is sure it's going to fulfill what it's going to fulfill. Amen. So when he said, "Let there be botney life." He got botney life. He was under expectation. What I've spoken will be. Amen. And when he said, "I'm going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle wash in my blood." Amen. Nothing, no order against her, no sin held against her whatsoever. When he spoke that, Amen. And when he spoke through you know to John you know the lamb's wife has made herself ready for granted unto her she be arrayed and fine linen clean and white which is righteous of saints. He wasn't wondering is it going to be h you know is it going to happen he was under expectation having a revelation knowing it was going to be fulfilled. Amen. And when God gives you a revelation of his word you can have expectation that it will happen exactly as he said. Amen. And he says here that it not not just going to go forth and accomplish, but it's going to prosper. It's going to flourish. Amen. And I believe the Lord has caused us to flourish spiritually. Amen. We're not a porper on the street just begging bread, you know, a few scraps from the master's table, but God has given us a big banquet. Amen. Of spiritual food. Amen. He's called us to the wedding, you know, you know, to his dining table like Mphibicheth was all crippled up. But when we got to David's table, he looked like everyone else. And God's called us to his table. We can have a bountiful feast that spiritually we're not starving but we're fat and flourishing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we can have expectation there's no end to this food. Amen. God's not going to withhold his his word from us. No, he's going to keep pouring it in and pouring it in and he's going to prove what he's given us and we're going to have an expectation that he's not giving us just theory. It's going to become reality. It's going to have a practical outworking in our lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Simeon was under great expectation cuz the Lord spoke to him. It wasn't just a hope. It was an expectation because it was a genuine revelation. And it didn't matter what others thought about it. It wasn't theirs. It was his. So people may look at you and say, "You're crazy. You've gone out of your mind. What are you following this thing?" And you've just gone overboard and just be like everyone else. But you're under expectation. See, because God spoke to you. Amen. God quickened his word to you. Amen. So you So So it's just not to them yet, but it's to you. So you can just rejoice and praise God knowing it's going to it's going to be fulfilled during that same time. Well, uh you know, so so when Jesus was born, there were shepherds in the field. There were shepherds in the field and and Jesus, we understand, was born in spring cuz he was the lamb of God. He wasn't born in December, but we celebrated it. We can celebrate it every day. Why not just have a big Christmas feast every day? That's good. We can do it, you know. But you know BC so so it was a springtime and the lambs and you know there were the shepherds and they were they were they were there just you know minding the sheep no doubt watching the use as they were lamming and you know but then suddenly there was an angel of the Lord came and spoke to them and it threw them into an expectation because they were told they were told by this angel that you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger. So before before that they just had a natural expectation. We're going to mind all of our lambs and you know we're just here looking after the sheep. And no doubt you know you know because they were Israelites they would have talked about the Lord and talked about prophecy and things. But when that angel came to them and and and said you you will find him in a specific place. Wasn't a vague promise. It was go to Bethlehem. You'll find the manger. You'll find him wrapped a certain way laying in a manger exactly as you exactly this way. And now this threw them in expectation that angel's message is true because it's a scriptural message. Amen. Because it was prophesied in the Bible that he would come out of Bethlehem. So they had an authority because brother Bram was was you know asked by people about the baptism and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and different things. And you know someone said well you know did the angel of the Lord tell you that you know that that this is how it should be and cuz we believe the angel and brother said if the angel of the Lord said anything contrary to the word I wouldn't believe him. and he's not the angel of the Lord. So everything must line up with the scripture. So when your expectation matches the scripture, you can have a real expectation knowing that God will fulfill it. Amen. So what did they do? They left their sheep. They ran into Bethlehem. And what did they find? Now I know we all know the story, but put yourself there. Okay? They're being told by an angel, you're going to see the Messiah. He's born tonight. He's not It's not even in the future. Right now, real time, he's born. He's in a manger in that city. You'll find him. Okay? So they what did they do? They ran into the city and they found they found him exactly where the angel said he would be. They didn't find him in a house. They didn't find him in a bed. They didn't find him even some of the things the angel said. Exactly as the angel said is exactly as he was found. Amen. And this is why they could have such confidence that that this angel's message did not lead them up some back alley in Bethlehem with no no Messiah there, but it led them straight to the Messiah. And we know that this message is a true message from God because the seventh angel messenger told us exactly where you'll find Jesus Christ. He didn't say you'll find him in a creed or a tradition. You'll find him in his word because he is his word. Amen. And after they met, after they ran into the ran into the manger and they saw the Lord exactly as the angel said, they broadcast everywhere saying what that angel told us on the hillside. Amen. We've seen it in flesh. And they became living witnesses. Amen. Their expectation was met. And then they took that expectation to Taliban, listen, God sent an angel to us. And he has revealed to us where he was. And we've seen him. We can point him. We can point you to him. He didn't disappear after he left. He's still on the earth. Amen. It's the same thing with us. Amen. That the message of brother Brandham has pointed us where Jesus Christ is in his word. And we've seen and we've tasted and God is transformed. Amen. When the angel said you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as in the day of Pentecost just like in the book of Acts. That is a book of Acts being rewritten in this day. Amen. It wasn't an empty promise. It was a reality cuz we are witnesses. Amen. That what he said that you can really be born again. that God can really live in your life. Amen. You can become A LIVING TABERNACLE OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. What he said, we've experienced and we know it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So we can rejoice. We can BROADCAST THIS EVERYWHERE SAYING THAT THE GOD of the Bible still lives. Amen. HE'S MORE THAN TRADITION. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT EVERYONE else has done with him. He's still alive. Amen. His word is right. His word is fulfilled. If you just take FAITH AND TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. AMEN. The expectation that we came under to receive it. Amen. You will receive it in the same way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What they do? They made so they ran. They made haste. They found Mary, Joseph, and the babe laying in the manger. They found him exactly as the message said. Amen. And then they returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. And I say friends, in this Christmas season or doesn't matter what season we're in, we can go glorifying God and praising him because he proves his word over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Because this gospel we have is not just a word only. It's not just an argument or a nice idea. No, they literally saw the living Messiah on the earth. Amen. They didn't just hear about him. They didn't hear a doctrine about him. They saw him alive in flesh. Amen. It's the same thing with you and I friends. The real believer sees the Messiah in flesh in this day. Where does the believer see him? In themselves first. Amen. And if you can see him on the inside, you can see him in one another. Amen. So the so the gospel that we've received is not just word only, but in power and demonstration and in much assurance. Amen. There's much assurance because the expectation God has given us is not empty. It's not just left hanging. is not something that's unfulfilled and maybe one day, no, it becomes a living reality today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we can go praising God like the shepherds because they weren't waiting one day. He's going to turn. No, the angel said he's here upon the earth now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that was their message. The angel's message became their message. Messiah is upon the earth now. And we have the same message, friends. Jesus Christ is on earth now. Where is he? He's in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. living, doing, working, fulfilling his word in our lives. What a great Christmas. Praise the Lord. Merry Christmas, everyone. Hallelujah. It's the greatest present we could ever have is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, it works in every condition. Praise the Lord. Amen. And you know, so, so who are we hailing today? We are not hailing a babe in a manger. We're not even hailing a 12-year-old boy in the temple. We are hailing a resurrected Jesus Christ. Amen. We are not hailing a dead man in a tomb. Though many people want him to stay dead because that means they can do what they want in their lives. No, we want a living God. Amen. A one that lives, speaks, deals, counsels, guides, protects, heals. Amen. Comforts. We want a living God. Amen. We don't want a dead tradition. Amen. The shepherds found a living God in a in a manger. You'll find a living God in his word today. Amen. And it's what brother Brand would say in the greatest news flashash in history. He says, "Can you imagine if this school had a basketball team or ba uh baseball basketball team? They went out and conquered their foe and returned back." You know, we had a great rivalry. When I was at school, there was us in Oakuckland Grammar with the first 15. I don't know if we won that match. I can't remember. But, you know, if we won, it would have been a big hurrah. You know, it wouldn't have been a bravo boys go back. You know there would have been a great celebration because their victory you know our school's pride and prestige was resting on if they beat the foe. I mean so could you imagine if your team or whoever you know you know it's like if New Zealand wins the World Cup or the spring box more likely you know win the World Cup the winners never just sit there and go have you ever se I think it's the soccer world cup next year. You see those teams if they're winning man their whole country erupts you know they're not just going bravo and that was a good game. you know, they're they're dancing on street poles. They're done. You know, they're flipping cars. They're doing crazy stuff cuz their team won. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine them saying, "Oh, well done." And just go back and we're just going to keep living life. No, they celebrate what they're doing. Amen. Because the because the expectation their team the expectation their team will win has been met. Now, how much more now the expectation of our living Lord Jesus, Amen. Conquering hell, death, and the grave. Amen. Fighting your battles. Amen. Overcoming in your life. Amen. That doesn't mean we just say, "Oh, well done, Lord. Thank you so much." No. No. There's something in us. There's a victory shout. Amen. There's a dance. Amen. That comes into our lives. Amen. Why? Because we realize it's not just some some some dirty funeral march. No. It's a victorious walk. And it's a victorious life. Amen. Hallelujah. There's a real salute. Amen. He says, "Could you imagine them standing there singing some little old song like near my God to thee?" To them. [snorts] No way. Oh, they're blowing their flags. They're hailing them. in their making. How about when m uh Napoleon came back? How about Stalin when he went into Germany? How they fired the guns, done the slute, and did their legs across that Russian slute. How about our boys returning home from their victory? The whistles blowed. The people went wild. They shot guns, they screamed, they rang bells. Why? We had conquered our enemy glory. And today, you' think you've got some kind of a morg go to a church and say, "We believe in God the Father Almighty. We believe in a resurrected Jesus Christ. Amen. A conqueror of hell, death, and the grave. I believe that he's alive tonight and in this building alive with us according to his promise where the two or three are gathered together I'll be there in their midst. No sir, not at some funeral service but hailing a mighty conqueror. Amen. We can have an expectation he's the mighty conqueror. Amen. That the victory he won that day on Calvary, he's here to fulfill that victory in our lives. Amen. That we're not just looking back and saying yes, he was 2,000 years ago. We can say he is tonight or this morning. Amen. And what do we do when we pray? and we open our word or we come to we come to church, we have our family prayer, we're hailing a mighty conqueror. Amen. The risen, resurrected, allconquering one is in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we can have an expectation. Lord, you're a conqueror. And you don't change your ways. He's a conqueror back then. He's conquering today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see, we've got to have the right expectation. Israel had the wrong expectation when when when when Jesus was born. That's why that's why the angels went to the shepherds, those ignorant shepherds on the on the hillside. He didn't go to the synagogues. He didn't go to the high priest. He went to those shepherds because everyone else was in a wrong expectation. They were expecting a messiah to come like a mighty king. Amen. That you know that, you know, they wanted a king to deliver them because they wanted a Messiah to match what they thought their need was. And their need wasn't an independent nation. You know, their need wasn't a sovereign country. No, their need was salvation from sin. Amen. So someone to come come and conquer sin, to conquer death, hell, and the grave. Amen. That they could have eternal life. But they were expecting a mighty king. They wanted that. Amen. Because if they had a mighty king, they would not have to change their ways. He would fight the battle for them and they could continue on. And it's much like today the modern church world. They want some great Superman to come and and and and and bring a Christian revival that will save the world. &gt;&gt; Well, he's already come. &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus. He is his word. Amen. But the problem is they want revival, but they don't want the the cost of revival, which is a death to self to lay aside tradition and let him be Messiah. Let him be the Lord of all. Amen. They're expecting some kind of king that they just step down of from the corridors of heaven, walk down to the earth in a full angel salute and the father would look out of heaven say, "I'm sending down to you now the Messiah." And they had it all fixed up that that's the way he was supposed to come. See, they were preaching that in their churches that it gave the wrong expectation. But what did they get? They got a baby instead of a mighty king. A baby born in a little stable, the side of a hillside, a little cave stable with straw and the manure from the animals. They had a baby and it was the answer to their prayer. It's exactly what they needed, but they wanted it their own way. They want it the way they thought was best. But God knows how to send it the way he knows is best because he is an infinite God and he knows just how to send it. See, God answers prayer how how he wants to answer prayer. Many times we go to God in prayer with the how we want it answered. Now Lord, just do it this way. Thank you, Lord. Amen. God answers prayer how he wants to. Amen. Because remember when we when we take our needs before the Lord, God's going to be working. He's not going to just be working on your request. He's going to be working on you. I mean, he's going to be giving bringing character into your life. The pay patience. Amen. He's going to be molding you as the answer's on its way. God [snorts] is very He's very thorough in how he answers things. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now, if they just rallied, those shepherds rallied around that great gift. I'm just finding where I am. Sorry. What' they get? They got a baby in a manger. You see, Israel, Israel, if they rallied around the gift in that day, they would have had another golden age. Because you see, brother Ram would say like like in like in Solomon's day, he said when they rallied around the gift of discernment in their king, Israel had a golden age. They had peace all around them. Their enemies were afraid of them. And during that time, the temple was being built. And I tell you what, friends, if we just rally around the gift of the Holy Ghost in this day, amen, we will have peace within our souls. you will truly find rest. Amen. That you know the world it doesn't mean the world will be absence of peace but the Lord said my peace I give unto you not as the world gives because the world gives peace and that peace is an absence of trouble but God gives a peace in the presence of trouble. I mean to prove his peace is different. Amen. But as we rallied like the shepherds they rallied around the gift of eternal life that came their way. And I believe we're say made of the same material as those shepherds. Amen. where we have heard, we have seen, we've experienced, now we're telling and we're living. Amen. The fact the Messiah is upon the earth today. And so now we have God has given us grace to rally around the gift of the Holy Ghost. And it gives us a golden age. Well, how can we have a golden age? The economics, there's trouble, there's strife, there's war, the No, there's a golden age amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. Because in Solomon's day, what was going on? that when that golden age came, the temple was put together. The house of God was put together. Amen. What's going on in this golden age? God is taking people from all around the world, taking them out of the muck of sin, stones for the building. Amen. And he's shaping us and molding us and he's putting us in our position in the body of Christ. Praise the Lord. That's an incredible thing. This is what eternal life does. Amen. It molds and shapes us. Amen. So that's why we can we can rally around Amen. this great gift of eternal life. And he gives us a peace that passes all understanding because he is still Jehovah Shalom. Amen. It doesn't matter how bad the world gets, God is always greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when when you receive this gift of eternal life now, and and I'm not saying you haven't, but you see, it's not just it's not just for you, but it spreads like the shepherds took that living message and they spread it to everyone who would hear them. Okay? Now, but it puts you into a great expectation. Now, you take when when Jesus I mean, sorry, when Paul Well, you could say Jesus because Jesus was in Paul and Silas, but when they were in the inner prison there, they just preached, they had been beaten, they were put there in the inner prison, and you know, they begin to pray and sing psalms around midnight, talk about the goodness of God. Amen. And God, you having a testimony meeting among themselves. Praise the Lord. And God came down, shook the place, opened every door, broke every chain. Now the now the jailer before they were put in prison, he was under an expectation. If these people escape, you're dead. Okay? So now the place shakes. He's heard their singing. Sure. But he's under this expectation. I'm going to die if these people get, you know, get out. Then the place shakes. Their chains are broken. The doors come open. Now he's under another expectation. I'm going to die. Right? But then what happened? He heard a voice. He heard a voice from the inner prison. Don't kill yourself. We're all still here. I mean, so that threw him into a different expectation. I mean, that the God that they were singing about was a real God. No doubt he had heard singing in pagan temples before, but this was different. I mean, so it put him into a different expectation. What must I do to be saved? Says, now an expectation, I can get saved. Amen. This God that they sung about that shook the place can actually give me salvation. And then it didn't just do that, but when when he asked the question to Paul and Silas, he says, "Sers, what must I do to be saved?" And they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved." So now put him into an expectation for himself and for his house. Like brother Bram says, "So in other words, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for thy house and they'll be saved." So the same faith that God gave you for your salvation, now apply it to your house. Be under expectation that if the same faith worked on you, it'll work on them. Put faith into action. Amen. Create an atmosphere, sorry, pardon me. Create an atmosphere around you of divine love. I mean, look beyond what you see with the five senses. Amen. Don't combat things carnally. Amen. But use, let God give you inspiration and understanding and wisdom. That's not how much you can control. your family will dictate they get eternal life. No, it doesn't work that way. It's creating atmosphere of divine love, letting God because you're an atmosphere creator. If you're grumpy, it'll create a grumpy atmosphere. If you're tense, you'll create a tense atmosphere. If you're fighting, what kind of atmosphere that is. But if you're a peaceable person, you're a peacemaker. You're not a gossip. You love everybody. You're you appreciate seeing everyone. You appreciate your family. That creates an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And brother says they'll drop right into it. So we should be under expectation. Lord, you save me, you're going to save them. Amen. Hallelujah. And I'm not looking by my five senses. I'm not looking what I see, I hear, I, you know, those things. No, my expectation overrides those things. Can you imagine Simeon if he was, you know, if he let the fact that he was old, am I really going to see the baby? Is this really going to happen? But his expectation, because it was a revelation, he said, "Well, I could die tomorrow, but before I die, I'm going to see him. That means it's going to happen soon. Amen. So it should, you know, we have a real godly expectation. It brings the promise into today. Amen. Because faith brings it into today. It's like Jesus said to Mary and Martha, you know, he talked to them about Lazarus and they both said, you know, one day he will raise in the resurrection in the last day. But Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life." In other words, what he did is he took the promise that they were looking way in the future for and he brought it into today. I am present tense the resurrection and the life. And that's what an expectation of the word does. It brings the brings the promise that somewhere out there maybe one day and brings it into the present. &gt;&gt; Do you have that kind of Bible expectation? Amen. God will do what he promised to do. &gt;&gt; Now this great thing about this gift of eternal life is that this what we rally around is it gives us overcoming power. First John 4 it says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets have gone out into the world. Hereby we know the spirit of God. Every spirit that confessth confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. So he is in flesh present now. Right? And every spirit that confessth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of Antichrist. Where of ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world. I'm glad he doesn't stop there. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Amen. So therefore, we we don't need to fear nothing. No spirit, no power of hell, no scheme of man because he says here, you have already you have overcome them. Not one day you will. You have overcome them. Amen. There's people warn about antichrist spirits. There's many different It's everything that opposes the word is an antichrist spirit. But we don't need to fear a single one of them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no power or even near equal to this gift of eternal life which is the Holy Ghost in your life. See, it takes all the fear out of us. Oh, but what if something gets me? He already got the Lord already got me. We're I'm his. I'm his lamb. He's stronger than them all. Amen. Nothing can pluck me out of his hands. This is what this gift of eternal I'm just going into now what it does. I mean, it doesn't just save our soul, but it gives us overcoming power to daily be victorious. Amen. So, you know, superstitions superstitions give power to the enemy. We don't need to we don't ever need to let a superstition uh control our lives. You know, it's amazing how people will will actually have a lot of faith in in witchcraft working. You know, some some some you know, a spiritualist or, you know, a witch or something, you know, will will cast a spell on someone and for some reason we people fear those believers fear those things. They actually have faith that what they do will work. We actually have fear about those people have fear about those things. Why would we why would we fear that when greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world? &gt;&gt; Why do we have to fear? It doesn't matter if every witch lined up and tried to curse a son or daughter of God. They're under the blood. Nothing can destroy them. I mean, when brother Brandon was preaching in Germany and they already warned him not, you know, they're going to destroy that tent that was built and all those witches were lined up in the audience and, you know, casting their spells, bringing a storm to destroy that thing. Amen. Who who packed the victory in that thing? Amen. God anointed his prophet and showed that a redeemed son or daughter of God has dominion over every work of the enemy. Amen. Because the because the tent was literally moving. The storm was literally there. It would have literally blown the thing apart. Amen. But a son of God stood there knowing who he was, knowing what eternal life does for him. Amen. And he stood there and he rebuked that thing and the leader fell over like in a coma and the sun came out. That wind stopped and thousands packed the altar. Why? Because God was challenged and the you know and God accepted the challenge of the enemy and God packed out the victory. Amen. Oh, you say that's the prophet of God. You're redeemed by the same blood. Amen. The same Holy Ghost is in you. Amen. You do not need to fear anything that tries to come against you. Remember, no weapon formed against you shall prosper. Amen. We don't need to fear nothing because we've rallied around the gift of eternal life. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, but they cast their spell. But that's weird because well what about your prayers? &gt;&gt; Do you believe your prayers? I'm going to come to that real soon. But you know don't you believe what you ask you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Because if people have faith well they're going to do their thing. It's going to happen. What about you under the blood of Jesus Christ? Amen. Where the blood puts you on speaking terms with God. And they're not talking to God. They're talking to the devil. And the devil's got to get permission from your God to do whatever he does. Amen. But you have dominion over every work of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must believe our weapon is is stronger. Amen. He says here in the greatest battle ever fought, see his attack. Watch, listen close. Uh this closing his attack is what? Disbelieve God's word. That's his attack. Um there. Can you see the greatest battle was ever fought? There's only two forces, Satan and God. And what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon. He disarms you. Let's listen real quiet. Now listen. If he can get you to dis get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent. I think too I think he meant to believe your weapon is equivalent. If he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough, he has disarmed you. He says, "Oh, brother Neville, I hope we never believe that." Amen. So I I pray we never believe that that that our weapon is not strong enough. Our weapon is strong enough. It's been proven down through the ages. Amen. It was manifested as a rod of deliverance out of Egypt. The children of Israel came out of Egypt. Amen. And it was proven there in Noah's day building the ark. It was, you know, they rode above the judgment. Amen. It was there manifested in Jesus Christ. He conquered hell, death, and the grave. That same power is in you and I. Amen. So our weapon is not just not um you know, it is far more powerful. It is far more greater because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, we have the privilege this day to enforce upon. So it doesn't matter. Don't don't ever get superstitious. Let the superstitions die. The thought that witchcraft can destroy you. Let that die. Oh, you know people like you like sisters, you know, mothers and you know, wives, they live in fear. What if a lust spirit gets my husband or my or my son? What's greater? Your prayer or that spirit? What's greater? Amen. You You intercede for your family. You don't need to pray out of fear, but of faith and assurance. God, you're my shield. and you're their shield, God. I'm your child. They're your children. God, you're more than enough. Amen. I don't need to fear nothing the enemy can turn against us because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Amen. God hears your prayers. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother asked a question. Who has more authority with God? An archangel that never fell or a or a sinner that just got washed in the blood 10 seconds ago? The sinner that's no longer a sinner has more authority with God than an archangel that stood there for eons of time and never fell. It's someone who's come under the blood of Jesus Christ. Because when you begin to talk, God basically says, "Angels, be quiet. My daughter's talking to me. My son's talking to me. They are more important to me than you angels." Praise the Lord. Well, we got to realize we have contact with God. Amen. This gift of eternal life is the answer to every problem. Never ever think that it's something's too complex or there's no way out. There is a way out. Remember, with every temptation, he makes a way of escape. Well, what is the temptation in many situations? Just build a bunker and hide somewhere up in the hills, close down emotionally. That's not a way of escape. God will give you a way of escape. We got to be willing to step out of our comfort zone. Remember, it takes a hero to go beyond the hurt. A coward will hide, but we're not cowards this morning. We're rugged Christians, aren't we? &gt;&gt; There's a few here. Good. &gt;&gt; Take courage, everyone. Be rugged. &gt;&gt; It's worth walking in God's goodness than hiding in a hole somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz this gift of eternal life will break every barrier. It can heal every hurt. It can break every complex. There's nothing too hard for the Lord. I'm just convinced. I'm sorry. I've been here long enough to see God do too much to think, well, there's not a pro. There's no too hard basket in heaven. There's nothing too complex. He made your body. We just go down the science of what's happening in your body right now. It's a very complex machine. You know, it's like, you know, I think it's in Genesis, you know, he made the earth and and it's just like a phrase, he made the stars also. So, so, so, so it's just like a side comment. He made all this creation. Oh, yeah. And he made the universe. That's how God put it in his word, you know. So, what's too hard for the Lord? I think he can solve anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, this gift of eternal life has absolute power cuz it's God himself. And we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan. See, this this gift of eternal life, Jesus Christ, our Lord, is not passive. Amen. And believers are not passive either. They're active. Active in prayer. They know prayer changes things. Amen. Prayer makes things possible. When it appears to be impossible, it makes the possible. It makes it reality. And we have a privilege this morning to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gives us. Amen. Amen. For God has a law and his word is a law. And God is his uh in in this word made certain claims to the church. Therefore, we should we have a right to enforce these claims upon Satan and give it back. Amen. And he has to do it. See, this gives us an expectation. Remember everything Jesus Jesus promised us, he purchased for us on Calvary. Every redemptive blessing of God is yours. Take something in the message in the Bible, whatever promise it is, it is yours because he died that you would receive it. Amen. So now we have So we are now under a great expectation that every claim God has given us, we can enforce upon Satan that he has to give it back. &gt;&gt; He has to do it because we can take God's agent, the Holy Ghost, go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord. He's got to give it up. That's all because the Holy Spirit is there to make him do it. Amen. The law of the land is to enforce. It's by the law. I mean, it's by the land for the land. But the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully de deceitfully taken from God. Souls of men he took from God. Souls of women, children, sickness of the body, he placed upon people where God God made them in his image to be like him. And the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon him. You have that right. You have that right to enforce these things upon Satan that you can get down on your knees and pray through that the peace of God comes. And what's that now? The Holy Ghost is going to enforce what you have prayed. Because when we pray, we believe what we're going to that we're going to receive it. Right? We don't go through some ritual motion of well, I've said this prayer. You know, we believe what we're inspired to pray. It doesn't matter how you feel, but there's a faith that says, "Lord, I'm under expectation. All things in your word are mine, and I believe they're going to be enforced by you, and you're going to fulfill them." That we're not just now trying to work out how to fulfill prophecy in our own strength. How can we manipulate situations to make things come to pass? No. When you rest in God, and God's given you the answer, it's going to happen. You can rest in that. And then what do you do? You just water that promise with praise and thanksgiving. Amen. Knowing it's on its way. Can you imagine the appearance of that prodical son in the Bible? Amen. There came a season because this anchored in their hearts. Honey, we have a right to enforce upon Satan that he has to let our son go. But we don't know where he is. We can't talk to him. Honey, that doesn't matter. Amen. GOD IS GOD EVERYWHERE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT can hide anyone from from God. Amen. And God knows where he is. Amen. We can pray cuz PRAYER CHANGES THINGS. WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT to believe all THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. AMEN. AND GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE. And we don't look at where he is or what HE'S GOT INTO. WHAT SIN HE'S BURIED IN, THAT'S IRRELEVANT because he's one of ours. He's part of God. He's part of us. So therefore, we're going to enforce upon Satan now in faith that God is going to go. &gt;&gt; We're not going to go. God's going to go. Cuz honey, remember, we tried to go one time. It just it just it just caused a bigger rift. But we're going to send the right enforcing agent, the Holy Ghost. Amen. AND HE'S GOING TO GET OUR SON BACK. You know what brother said? They they knelt down. They prayed. THEY COMMITTED HIM TO GOD AND FAITH and a faith came. You know, a peace came and they said, "Now we now let's just praise him. Now let's just praise HIM." WE SAY, "WHEN'S HE COMING BACK, HONEY? That's irrelevant. Now we're going to water the promise CUZ GOD'S HEARD OUR PRAYERS. AMEN. GOD'S greater than the spirit that dragged them away and God's going to bring him back." Amen. And it wasn't that long after that. Well, I don't know the time frame, but time frames are irre are relevant to God. A what happened is that you that you that son was in the pig pen and the Bible says he came to himself. Do you know what that h what caused that wasn't his own mental understanding. Amen. It was actually this angel of the Lord came into the pig pen where he was and gave him a clear mind. Amen. Cuz those who are running in the world or just running away from God, they try to reason. I can make things better. I can get out of this problem. I can bring peace. If I just do this, get into this hobby, this job, this thing, I can get what I want. But that's not the right thinking. The right thinking is I just need to get back to father's house. I just need to get back to where God is. Amen. And so, so he came to himself. The angel of the Lord pushed that spirit off him and he came to himself realizing I should just go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. What happened? They enforced upon Satan, Satan, you've got to give him back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if someone if someone could do that now, Jesus said, now a certain man had two sons, right? So, so if you take that now in time, that's a man under the blood of bulls and goats. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus hadn't died yet. &gt;&gt; So, there was an Israelite, a a son of Abraham, circumcised believer under the blood of bulls and goats, and he could enforce upon Satan that God, you know, that God would restore his son back into the family. Same thing with, you know, Moses. He was under the blood of bulls and goats, and he called flies and plagues and brought a deliverance out of, you know, you know, Israel, out of Egypt. And brother Ram says, "Now, if a man under the blood of bulls and goats can do that kind of thing, how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ?" Amen. Where there's no longer a chasm between them and God, there's not some some some offering that just covers sin, but the blood of Jesus Christ annihilates sin, annihilates the chasm, gives full restoration back between God and man. How much more are people in that condition? &gt;&gt; Hello, people in that condition. &gt;&gt; How you doing today? Hallelujah. [sighs] &gt;&gt; It's in your power. &gt;&gt; This is what this is what eternal life does. &gt;&gt; We must have an expectation that God can do it. &gt;&gt; If you give any power to the devil, it gives him it just produces fear in your life. &gt;&gt; And fear hath torment. &gt;&gt; But perfect love casts out all fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. to never ever let anything of his works have control in your life. How do you know it has control? You fear it. We don't need to fear nothing. We don't go looking for trouble. We understand that, right? Trouble finds us. But we can have full assurance that perfect love will cast out all fear. Amen. And we're living in a season of perfect love. If you got the Holy Ghost this morning, you have perfect love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we don't need to fear nothing. We can walk with God. Now, let's just read this here. I'm just going to read a couple of promises cuz prayer prayer works. &gt;&gt; Okay. So Jesus would say, "Verily, I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith." Remember this is this is when inspiration strikes you. Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them. Do you believe what you pray for and you shall have them. And when you stand praying, forgive. Amen. This is see when when God comes into someone's life, you can't hold something against anybody. &gt;&gt; You can't. It's just because eternal life comes in. You want to forgive everybody. You don't want any ought. You don't want any trouble. You just want peace cuz peace is coming to you. Amen. But you see now we're living in a season like brother Brown was challenged by the Lord one day to take him at his word and believe this when he's squirrel hunting. We know the creation of the squirrels, the fish got its life back. Had he writes two sons got eternal life, the storm, all all those things. That same power is within you and I. It should put us under expectation that God can do the impossible. And it's not and it's not us humanly saying now what do I want? &gt;&gt; It's not that way at all. It's God controlling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we got to let God. We're going to be under We have to be under an expectation. Lord, you can do whatever you want, whenever you want in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Amen. So, well, well, we need the prophet to have the power of the spoken word. No, that power is within you and I. &gt;&gt; Like I've shared many times about the about the broken hot water cylinder that we had fully disconnected from the house. Gas was turned off. Everything was physically disconnected from the house. And you Jimmy was there. I know. Well, yeah, we'll do this again, but you know, but you know, it was it was Sunday morning. We had Tony and Sharon staying with us. We had no hot water whatsoever. It was disconnected on the Friday. And we, you know, and and we were boiling the jug and trying to get hot water to have a bath and things before church with that. And but, you know, before that, I just said without thinking, I said it to Christine a couple of times, you can have hot God loves you so much that he can give you hot water if he wants to. as a low part of things were heavy and think you know we're you know we were going through some things and I just said to her a couple of times she just took that from the Lord I believe and you know she went to fill the jug up with the with the shower upstairs and she turned it on and it was instantly hot water so she got had a shower now it's physically disconnected from the house it's physically impossible for us to have hot water right but what happened is something was spoken and she received it we can have God can if he wants to right and turns on the shower gets and has a hot shower. I have a hot shower. Jimmy's downstairs has half a hot shower. And then that was it. &gt;&gt; And the same plumber guy. What was that? Sorry. &gt;&gt; I had a hot shower, too. &gt;&gt; You had a hot shower, too. Okay. Sorry. You had You had a full hot shower. There was three hot showers going on. That was good blessing. E. Anyway, you see, and then and then on the Monday, the next day, the plumber who disconnected the whole hot water cylinder, turned off the gas and everything, came back. And Christine said to um said to him, "No, we had hot we we had hot showers yesterday, Sunday morning." He said, "I can't believe you. I physically disconnected this thing. This it's physically impossible for you to have hot water yesterday. The pilot lights turned off. The gas is turned off. The water's disconnected from the house. You can't do it." She said, "Well, we did." If God can give hot water, &gt;&gt; see this why you should speak faith &gt;&gt; to each other. Don't even be conscious. WHAT? DON'T DON'T WORK OUT what to say, but say, "No, God can do it." That's right. &gt;&gt; God can do it. Amen. So, if God can give us hot water just out of a desire, how much more God giving us our loved ones, &gt;&gt; our family, our health, what whatever need, whatever burden we're carrying, I believe we're living in a season cuz God, we have rallied around the gift of the Holy Ghost in this day, God has given us grace to do it. Amen. God can give us whatsoever we ask for. &gt;&gt; I believe that. Amen. And and again I say unto you, if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything, just say anything. &gt;&gt; Anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. That's why it's so important when you pray agree with someone not just near in your heart. Yes, Lord, it can be done. Amen. He says concerning anything, I will do it. There's power and power in two coming together. That's why you got to create an environment in your home where we love the Lord. We believe his word. We're not here to talk about negative things and people and carnal stuff. We're here to talk about promises and what God can do. And you'll see him step in and do incredible things. Amen. And and and in that day you shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask in the the Father in my name, he shall give it you. Here unto have you asked nothing in my name. Ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full. Who wants full joy? &gt;&gt; This is a season of tidings of great joy. Why not be one where it's the joy of God you answered prayer? God, you've thrown me into expectation because you've quickened to my heart your word. Amen. Lord, the promise is on its way. So, I I'm I'm full of joy. I'm not full of doubt and worry and guessing it's going to happen. I've got an expectation, Lord. You can do it. And then we'll finish just with this again. Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. &gt;&gt; He can do exceedingly abundantly above all. Are you under expectation that divine love can conquer everything? &gt;&gt; Do you know it can? &gt;&gt; Well, let him live in this day. May this Let's just have the musicians this morning. It's going to finish there, but let this Christmas season and let as we go into 2026, may it be a year and a time, this this great gift he gave us would live like never before that the power of God would be so real in our lives that his word that he would throw us into such an expectation like Simeon, you're going to see the longing of your heart's going to be manifested in this time. what you've been wanting to see because no doubt because he is a devout man. He was looking for the Messiah. He wanted it. But then God actually was so gracious to him. You're going to see him before you die. I mean, I believe we're like Simeon or Anna, the blind prophetist in the temple that came by that way as well. God led her there. Amen. But God is God's grace is so great upon us that he will give us the desires of our heart. Because the desires of our heart is not a fancy car. It's not heaps of money. It's not those kind of things. It is the salvation of our house. Amen. So actively believe. You believe for your own salvation. Now let God use that same faith to apply to everyone around you. And you watch them step into that anointing and God will break the yoke of the enemy and set them free. I believe it. Amen. Why? Cuz we can we can we can we can rejoice. Imagine the feeling he had as he picked up Jesus in his arms. Lord, you promised it. Now he's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many times has God fulfilled his word, thrown us into expectation? [music] It's yours. I'm going to give it to you. Then you embrace the promise. You see it in its fulfillment. God hasn't stopped doing that, friends. [music] This message is alive. So may you have a very blessed merry Christmas. May be may he be the great gift as we give gifts to one another. But maybe he be the g great gift you rally around in your house. You celebrate with your families, your loved ones. you travel, wherever you're going, may the great gift of eternal life, Jesus Christ our Lord, be number one in your heart. Amen. Let's stand, shall we? [music] Amen. What are we singing? Sorry. &gt;&gt; My chain's [music] gone. Okay. His mercy reigns. Unending love.
