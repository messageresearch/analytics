[37:42] has been taken to a valley of dry bones
[37:45] exceedingly dry this earlier part and um
[37:48] this is the house of Israel spiritually
[37:49] speaking he says then he said unto me
[37:51] son of man these bones are the whole
[37:53] house of Israel behold they say notice
[37:55] what these bones are saying bones are
[37:58] dried our hope is lost we are cut off
[38:00] from our parts therefore prophesy and
[38:03] say unto them thus sayith the Lord God
[38:04] behold oh my people I'll open your
[38:07] Graves and cause you to come out of your
[38:09] Graves and bring you into the land of
[38:10] Israel and you shall know that I am the
[38:13] Lord that I have opened your Graves oh
[38:15] my people and brought you up out of your
[38:16] Graves and shall put my spirit in you
[38:19] and you shall live and I will place you
[38:21] in your own land then shall you know
[38:24] that I the Lord have spoken it and
[38:26] performed it saith the Lord amen amen to
[38:29] me that's a tremendously powerful piece
[38:31] of scripture amen let's bow our heads in
[38:33] a word of prayer this morning if you

[39:23] and may you have your way Lord we commit
[39:25] Our Lives into your hands Lord as as we
[39:27] remember those who couldn't be here
[39:28] today may you be their abundant portion
[39:31] as well for your glory Lord in Jesus
[39:33] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[39:36] friends you can have your seats this
[39:37] morning so I want to speak about can
[39:39] these uh can these Dry Bones live yeah
[39:43] now I just want to really focus on you
[39:45] know we have a word of restoration this
[39:47] morning we know that this message fully
[39:49] restores it doesn't patch up we don't
[39:52] not have a religion we have a true
[39:53] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:56] God himself no this is not some
[39:58] conforming to some rules no this is God
[40:01] wanted to restore his word in this day
[40:03] he wanted to restore a true spiritual
[40:06] relationship between God and man that's
[40:08] the purpose of this message coming in
[40:10] the end time now notice how Ezekiel when
[40:13] he would when he would be showing these
[40:15] even maybe let's just go to the first
[40:17] part of the I don't have all of Ezekiel
[40:19] 37 here but but but look at the look at
[40:22] this the hand of the Lord was upon me
[40:24] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[40:26] Lord and set me down in theid of a
[40:27] valley which are full of Bones and
[40:30] caused me to pass by them round about
[40:32] and behold there were very many in the
[40:34] open Valley and low they were very dry
[40:37] and he said unto me son of man can these
[40:40] bones live and I answered oh Lord God
[40:43] thou knowest now there come situations
[40:46] in life where where where God asks a
[40:49] question can this be revived can this be
[40:52] restored can life come back into the
[40:54] situation can it be restored back into a
[40:56] Time of joy and the outpouring of the
[40:58] Holy Ghost and life in the body once
[41:01] again and but some things that we look
[41:03] at humanly with our eyes and we think
[41:05] how can this how can this live again
[41:07] it's been you look at these bones as as
[41:10] Ezekiel said they were very dry this
[41:12] wasn't even a um a a valley of Flesh uh
[41:17] uh people had just been killed you know
[41:18] it hadn't just been a battle or even
[41:20] Lazarus 4 days in the grave kind of a
[41:22] condition these these these bodies had
[41:25] rotted the bones were dry there was no
[41:27] life there was no moisture there was
[41:29] nothing now this is speaking of a
[41:31] spiritual condition of a people right am
[41:33] mean so so even even some situations or
[41:36] people in life if I can put it this way
[41:38] there's a doubt can creep into our
[41:40] hearts how could they live again how
[41:42] could they be restored again how can how
[41:44] can because remember I mean I don't know
[41:46] if these are real bones or not but just
[41:48] for argument sake they were once upon a
[41:50] time they were alive once upon a time
[41:52] they had voice they had life in their
[41:54] body blood flowing through their veins
[41:56] they had they were walking in the
[41:58] fullness of God the power of God was
[42:00] moving in their lives they were walking
[42:02] in Joy amen but they death came in
[42:05] somehow and the enemy came in somehow
[42:08] and now they're in this kind of
[42:09] condition and you know and and as
[42:11] Ezekiel would see the house of Israel in
[42:13] this condition and God asked him the
[42:16] question can these bones live now God
[42:18] already has the answer but he wants our
[42:21] answer to be his answer amen cuz he
[42:23] already saw them alive as a great Army
[42:25] standing on their feet with the spirit
[42:27] of God living in them once again he saw
[42:30] them in that God saw them in that
[42:31] condition but he needed someone upon the
[42:33] Earth to see the same way he saw he
[42:36] needed a he needed see you look at
[42:38] Ezekiel he was a prophet of God he saw
[42:40] he saw the Throne of God and the four
[42:42] living creatures that cherums around the
[42:44] throne he saw great scenes of you know
[42:47] God's majesty and power but then when
[42:49] God showed him the spiritual state of
[42:51] his people he said I don't know Lord you
[42:54] know he asked can these bones live he
[42:56] says oh Lord God thou knowest so
[42:58] basically saying I don't know God but
[42:59] you know and and so God would God would
[43:02] tell him you know to prophesy to these
[43:05] bones and there would be a restoration
[43:08] process of of the bones coming together
[43:10] so there' be connections be you know
[43:12] senu would come and ligaments and muscle
[43:15] and all these things but even it came to
[43:17] a place where they were just a bunch of
[43:19] bodies on the field but the Breath of
[43:21] Life the Breath of God had to come into
[43:23] them and and and um Ezekiel was
[43:25] instructed prophesy son of man and so
[43:28] brother Bram would say in the
[43:29] restoration of the brid Tre he'd speak
[43:31] about ezekiel's dry bones in the end of
[43:33] that service and he'd say prophesy son
[43:35] of man so a word would be released to
[43:37] bring a restoration so not just a not
[43:40] just an outward looking of a Christian
[43:42] amen not just the right way of dress and
[43:45] different things but there the Holy
[43:46] Ghost the life of God would come into a
[43:49] people that they'd stand up and be a
[43:50] great Army once again so these people
[43:53] were once alive but now they are dead
[43:55] but there would come a restoration and
[43:57] this is what happened we know that you
[43:59] know you on the day of Pentecost God had
[44:01] a living Army upon the Earth you know
[44:03] they were you the church was not in the
[44:05] state of like these dry bones of a
[44:07] separation of Bones and no life and
[44:09] nothing moving just dead on the field
[44:11] but you know so so they were alive but
[44:13] then the enemy came and you know through
[44:16] different processes and finally there
[44:17] was a dark age but God and then even
[44:20] maybe if we could look back in that time
[44:22] we see before Luther and the reformation
[44:24] and even you know different ones before
[44:26] him would' say how could how could God
[44:28] ever
[44:29] restore now I want to parallel this to
[44:31] us right now in 2024 because sometimes
[44:34] we look at situations in life and say
[44:37] how can this come how can God you can
[44:39] restore these things it's been look
[44:41] these bones these bodies have been here
[44:43] too long this person's been in this
[44:44] state too long amen spiritually dried up
[44:47] on a field an open field no life in them
[44:49] and nothing and how could they be
[44:51] restored but God wants to restore amen
[44:54] God wants to raise our faith to
[44:56] believers word for the impossible amen
[44:59] that are people that you know I'll just
[45:01] I just going to jump down to the
[45:03] scripture and we're going to come back
[45:05] here but you know Hallelujah the Bible
[45:08] says a brother offended is harder to be
[45:10] one than a strong City and their
[45:12] contentions are like the bars of a
[45:14] castle now a city a strong City can
[45:18] still be conquered someone with
[45:20] resentment and hurt and pushing against
[45:24] the truth actively fighting against God
[45:26] they can still be won over am the
[45:29] longest Siege in history I Google it was
[45:31] about 23 years in Morocco the Spanish
[45:34] had a fortress there and they are
[45:35] defending against the Moroccans
[45:36] eventually the Moroccans took the city
[45:38] but it was 23 years of a Siege the
[45:41] Moroccans wanted that City back they
[45:44] were determined we wanton our land back
[45:45] we want our city back eventually they
[45:47] won the thing you know and some PE you
[45:50] know sometimes we've got to look at
[45:52] people and say the enemy may have made
[45:54] them a valley of dry bones they may be
[45:57] they may be they may be fully against
[45:59] the word of God but if God has dropped
[46:01] the Revelation in our hearts that
[46:03] they're coming then you will lay us The
[46:05] Siege prise the Lord amen you're
[46:07] determined that you're going to kick
[46:08] that unbelief out that God through you
[46:10] is going to kick that unbelief out if
[46:12] it's a revelation to you amen then
[46:14] you'll be determined not just a an
[46:16] emotion not just a nice idea but when it
[46:19] becomes a revelation amen then then we
[46:21] can be so determined in the trial that
[46:24] God is going to fulfill his promise in
[46:27] his season amen so here are these you
[46:30] know we understand that the Lord Jesus
[46:32] would speak about the Pharisees and say
[46:34] outwardly you may appear righteous but
[46:37] inwardly you're nothing but a bunch of
[46:39] Dead Man's Bones of all uncleanness so
[46:42] they were people walking around talking
[46:44] they were religious they had their
[46:46] worship but yet inwardly there was no
[46:48] life in them they were like this field
[46:50] of dry bones and you know it had become
[46:53] the accepted Norm that the Pharisees and
[46:55] the Sadducees this was the way to work
[46:56] worship God but they were like in this
[47:00] condition but there had to be people
[47:02] that would come out of those tombs come
[47:03] to life again be restored to walk with
[47:06] God because if you look at Israel even
[47:08] you know they came out of um came out of
[47:10] Egypt they were under the pillar of Fire
[47:12] by Night A Cloud by day God moved in
[47:14] power they were they were a living Army
[47:16] but then Traditions came in unbelief
[47:18] came
[47:19] in and they became this valley of dry
[47:21] bones but God said I will restore and
[47:24] this is the same thing in this day that
[47:27] individually we must be restored back to
[47:29] the power of Pentecost again back to the
[47:31] book of Acts again back to where God
[47:33] lives in his church fulfilling his word
[47:35] again it's no longer just conforming to
[47:38] a message and a nice idea and going to
[47:40] church but God comes and lives inside
[47:43] amen because we got to
[47:44] realize me the Pharisees were anointed
[47:47] Jesus cuz he wasn't a Pharisee see and
[47:50] people just want to swap ideas
[47:53] religions like when brother bam he was
[47:55] in India once and and he was invited to
[47:58] a some big Temple and all the major
[48:01] religions of India were there
[48:02] representatives of you know the siks and
[48:04] the James and the Buddhists and the
[48:06] Hindus and Muslims different ones all
[48:08] the major religions and they all got up
[48:11] and they spoke about how great their
[48:12] religion was
[48:14] yeah we're going to clear a flu okay
[48:17] unclogs on
[48:19] pipes we're going to get to that
[48:20] actually so my notes anyway but you see
[48:22] he was he was uh brought to this big
[48:24] Temple or whatever and all these
[48:26] different religion were there of India
[48:27] and they would they would you know get
[48:29] up and they' say how great their
[48:31] religion was but how little Christianity
[48:33] was and one by one they would they would
[48:35] you know say these things and brother
[48:37] Braham got up and he said you know
[48:39] gentlemen you've told me how great your
[48:41] God is and how wonderful your religions
[48:43] are and how little Jesus Christ really
[48:45] is but you know I'm inviting you
[48:47] tomorrow we're having Church you all
[48:48] know we're having a meeting tomorrow I
[48:50] want you to come to this
[48:52] meeting and then so brother Braham was
[48:54] preaching about the resurrection of the
[48:56] Lord Jesus Christ Christ how he is God
[48:58] made flesh and he's the he's the true
[48:59] and living God and then they had a
[49:01] prayer line now we know the gift in
[49:03] brother braham's life is God himself
[49:04] would step into him and he would see
[49:06] visions of people's needs and troubles
[49:08] and different things and there was a
[49:10] prayer line but before the prayer line
[49:11] brother brah had a vision of a man who
[49:13] was a sun worshiper totally Stone Blind
[49:15] by staring at the sun and God would
[49:18] restore his sight there on the platform
[49:19] so he had Revelation this man's going to
[49:21] get a sight back and then so when this
[49:24] man came up and everyone could see he
[49:25] was blind didn't need any discernment
[49:27] you know to see what was his problem his
[49:29] eyes were totally white cuz he was he
[49:31] spent so long humanly trying to please a
[49:33] God and this is the problem people can
[49:35] be a bunch of Dead Man's Bones humanly
[49:38] trying to please God so he was trying to
[49:40] do something how can I get peace with
[49:42] this deity I'm trying to worship and so
[49:44] he'd stare at the sun he went totally
[49:46] blind and now so as this man was
[49:48] standing in front of him brother Bram
[49:49] addressed all the religions there cuz
[49:51] all those men who told him the day
[49:53] before how how Jesus Christ was nothing
[49:55] and their religion so good were there
[49:57] sitting there in the meeting and he said
[49:59] gentlemen there's no wonder you know you
[50:01] know we we can see this man is blind now
[50:04] if your God is the god the creator of
[50:07] heavens and earth who made all things
[50:09] let him come and restore this man yeah
[50:13] and they sat as still as Church mice and
[50:16] brother BR would explain look all you
[50:18] want to do is make this person just say
[50:20] if he's a Buddhist you want to make him
[50:21] a Jane or if he's a Jane you want to
[50:22] make him a Hindu or you know you just
[50:24] want to change his thinking and brother
[50:26] brah said we have the same problem in
[50:27] America all the Baptists want to make
[50:30] all the Pentecostals Baptist and all the
[50:31] Pentecostals want to make everyone
[50:33] Pentecostal and they just want to change
[50:35] their thinking but we're not here to
[50:36] change people's thinking we're here to
[50:39] that God would give them a transforming
[50:40] power of a birth and a change of a life
[50:43] amen and then he prayed for the man and
[50:45] as he was getting halfway through the
[50:46] prayer his eyes were restored he ran out
[50:48] of the place seeing amen because because
[50:50] brother BR said look I can't give him
[50:51] back his sight but Jesus Christ can amen
[50:54] he's here to give him back his sight and
[50:56] the reason reason he could stand there
[50:57] and make that challenge and do that is
[50:59] because he had a revelation that his
[51:01] eyes were coming open amen so if you
[51:03] have a revelation someone's not going to
[51:05] stay dry bones you're going to beseech
[51:06] that castle I mean you're going to with
[51:08] all your prayers and and you know your
[51:10] motivation is going to be lord they're
[51:12] yours where's the entrance into this
[51:14] where's the where's the where's the
[51:16] tunnel where's the what do I need Lord
[51:18] to get in and and and and and restore
[51:21] them sir amen because you see we do not
[51:24] need emotion amen we do not need emotion
[51:27] amen it's yours my brother amen amen we
[51:30] do not need emotion amen David got to a
[51:33] place in his life where where he went
[51:35] through an emotional roller coaster he
[51:38] came back to Zig lag he's he's living in
[51:40] a time of a great a great season where
[51:42] he's about to be made King because Saul
[51:44] had just been killed in battle and then
[51:46] they come back they had escaped having
[51:48] to fight for the Philistines and you
[51:50] know would have been such a relief to be
[51:52] to be to be let go from the battle but
[51:54] then when they come it's amazing when
[51:56] who who's ever seen a house on
[52:00] fire who's ever realized it's not your
[52:02] neighbor's house it's your
[52:04] house different feelings come through
[52:06] your mind you know I remember standing
[52:09] in primary school this is in gisburn one
[52:11] we Beach primary school and I looked out
[52:13] a classroom window and there was a big
[52:14] mass of fire in the direction of my
[52:16] house thankfully it wasn't my house but
[52:19] a whole bunch ofo saying is that our
[52:21] house it could be our house now David
[52:23] and like like brother imp Paul as well
[52:24] he would have gone from maybe it's a
[52:26] neighbor to to know it's definitely me
[52:28] and then they come back to zigg lagac so
[52:30] all this emotions going on you know and
[52:32] then they they wept until they had no
[52:35] more power to weep not just him but all
[52:37] the men with him because they lost all
[52:39] their families the amalekites had come
[52:42] burnt Zig lag and taken all their
[52:45] families
[52:46] away and no doubt so so they had a lot
[52:49] of and it says David was greatly
[52:51] distressed for the people spake of
[52:53] stoning him because the soul of all the
[52:55] people was grieved every man for his
[52:58] sons and for his daughters yeah so he
[53:01] did not need emotion in this moment he
[53:04] did not need a nice feeling he was going
[53:06] to get them back he needed Revelation it
[53:09] had to go from Beyond a high to a
[53:12] revelation because emotions just like
[53:15] these ones before this he would have
[53:16] felt relieved he doesn't have to fight
[53:18] with the Philistines against against
[53:21] Israel but then he sees his house on
[53:23] fire and he sees his family gone he
[53:24] would have gone through a lot of
[53:25] different emot
[53:27] but he did not need an emotion to know
[53:29] it was God was going to give them back
[53:32] he needed a revelation he needed a
[53:34] direct word from the Lord hallelujah
[53:37] because David knew God had given them
[53:40] God had given him his family that's
[53:42] right David knew that his wives were
[53:44] part of him but then but he had to see
[53:47] he encouraged himself in the Lord his
[53:49] God Amen and then David said to Aba the
[53:52] priest ahit your son I pray thee bring
[53:54] me hither the ephod and and ABA brought
[53:57] them hither the EA of David and David
[53:59] inquired at the Lord saying shall I
[54:00] pursue after this troop shall I overtake
[54:03] them and he answered him
[54:05] pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake
[54:07] them and without fail recover all amen
[54:10] so it went from an emotion to a
[54:12] revelation and that Revelation overcame
[54:16] all the fear all the worry all the doubt
[54:18] all the trouble cuz it was anchored in
[54:20] his heart he was going to recover all
[54:22] without fail there wasn't a maybe you'll
[54:24] get it maybe you'll get half your family
[54:26] you're going to get them all so he could
[54:27] pursue after his enemy he could pursue
[54:30] with determination with Zeal with
[54:32] Thanksgiving with praise because God had
[54:35] shown him they were coming right and if
[54:38] we could stand in every test in that in
[54:40] that state I mean where the word of God
[54:43] goes from a nice idea to a reality I
[54:45] mean then we can walk with confidence
[54:47] you see God doesn't walk want us to walk
[54:50] wondering if the promise will happen he
[54:52] wants us it to be revealed into our
[54:54] hearts and then we can walk into it no
[54:56] it's already done cuz our God is a god
[54:59] of Revelation not nice ideas not emotion
[55:01] see this world is built on emotion do
[55:03] not Build Your Walk On Emotion build
[55:06] your walk on Revelation of the word amen
[55:08] because your emotions will lie to you
[55:10] feel yes it's here but when God anchors
[55:13] it into your heart amen doesn't matter
[55:15] how you feel it's going to come
[55:17] hallelujah amen that's why we must pray
[55:19] for Revelation more than anything not
[55:22] nice feelings not nice see feelings will
[55:24] come with revelation
[55:27] David's feelings would have changed God
[55:29] just told me we're going to get men be
[55:31] of good cheer you heard the word of the
[55:32] Lord we're going to get our families
[55:35] back God's revealed it to us let's go
[55:37] get them so his emotions would have
[55:39] changed but him pursuing was not based
[55:41] on his his emotions his pursuing was
[55:44] based on Revelation amen amen and we are
[55:47] a people of
[55:48] Revelation amen we are Christians by re
[55:51] God has revealed himself to us that's
[55:53] why we're Christians amen even if you
[55:55] really you're lost God has revealed that
[55:58] to you amen and he's revealed that to
[56:00] you that you can give your life to him
[56:02] and receive his atoning blood amen so we
[56:05] must have we must have amen Revelation
[56:09] in every circumstance amen especially in
[56:11] this day and age of of of every human
[56:13] senses being just being maxed out
[56:17] feelings of you know you Elation and
[56:19] emotion and different highs and lows and
[56:21] you know the you know the human psyche
[56:23] and the human temperament has been so
[56:25] manipulated
[56:27] to control amen that's why things are so
[56:29] captivating it's the reason why things
[56:31] on your media and different things are
[56:33] so addictive because it Taps into I
[56:35] think they call it brain hacking it's
[56:37] actually a term how do we hack people's
[56:39] brains to make money off them and use
[56:41] their time and everything why as the
[56:43] human psyche has being
[56:46] manipulated but God doesn't want to do
[56:47] it that God doesn't work that way God
[56:50] brings Revelation by his word and that's
[56:52] how we walk am mean as I already said
[56:55] this book revelation is the consummation
[56:57] of the scriptures it's even placed
[56:59] exactly right in the cannon of the
[57:00] scriptures at the end now you can know
[57:02] why it says that Anyone who reads or
[57:04] even hears it as blessed it's the
[57:06] revelation of God that will give you
[57:08] authority over the devil and you can see
[57:10] why they who who would add or take from
[57:13] it would be cursed it would have it
[57:15] would have to be so for who can add or
[57:18] take away from the perfect revelation of
[57:20] God and overcome the enemy this is why
[57:23] the devil wants us to add or take away
[57:24] from revelation do you add your own
[57:27] thoughts your own feelings you mix it in
[57:29] with that Revelation and then it becomes
[57:31] added or taken away from it distorts it
[57:33] but if you take God simply at his word
[57:36] and say God reveal me reveal you to me
[57:40] on your word alone amen then that will
[57:43] give you prevailing power amen it is
[57:47] that simple there is nothing as such
[57:49] prevailing power is the revelation of
[57:52] the word amen that that is more
[57:55] prevailing than trying work things out
[57:57] it's more more prevailing than getting a
[57:59] collection of facts and finding a
[58:00] conclusion and and humanly reasoning
[58:02] things out no if we have Revelation amen
[58:05] then there's nothing as prevailing as
[58:07] that amen and if we have Revelation that
[58:09] these Dry Bones will
[58:11] live amen whatever situation you may
[58:14] look at someone say they're very dry how
[58:17] could they ever live how could they I
[58:18] can't even remember the time they once
[58:19] in the prin of God living they can live
[58:22] again amen those bones can live if it's
[58:24] revealed to you they're going to live
[58:26] amen that's why God had to get Ezekiel
[58:28] Amen to look at those bones like he
[58:30] looked at those bones am me he wanted
[58:33] see Ezekiel when he first saw the bones
[58:34] he was looking at this is impossible
[58:36] Hallelujah God says can these bones live
[58:38] he says oh Lord thou knowest so
[58:40] basically he's like I don't know I have
[58:41] no idea Lord humanly it's impossible but
[58:44] with God nothing's impossible amen so
[58:46] that's why we must look at things say
[58:48] God let me look at everything through
[58:51] your eyes not through my eyes through
[58:53] your eyes may I look at everything not
[58:55] through my culture but through your
[58:56] culture oh God through your word Lord
[58:58] Jesus not by my upbringing not by my
[59:00] social standing whatever I think I am
[59:03] may I look at everything through your
[59:04] eyes oh God Amen then if we can look at
[59:07] everything through his eyes amen I
[59:08] believe we'll see the miraculous amen I
[59:11] believe we won't quit am me I believe
[59:12] discouragement will not be a a thing
[59:15] that will rule us I mean the devil will
[59:17] try and discourage see maybe Ezekiel
[59:19] looked discouraged when he saw the bones
[59:21] I I believe very much that you know
[59:23] David was very discouraged when he saw
[59:25] Zig lagac burning
[59:27] but that wasn't the end of the story
[59:30] amen
[59:31] so Hallelujah see we must have a
[59:35] motivation that bones will live again
[59:38] amen not just not just not just flesh
[59:40] coming on to people not just people
[59:42] being justified and Sanctified cleansed
[59:44] up but the Holy Ghost comes and lives in
[59:46] that person amen that's the that's the
[59:49] that is the
[59:50] cural that is actually the cural of
[59:52] every family problem is more of the god
[59:55] the holy ghost moving in lives amen that
[59:57] is the cure all that's the thing that
[59:58] will fix everything everything else is
[1:00:00] but a Band-Aid amen but but the Lord him
[1:00:04] coming in flesh dwelling in you changing
[1:00:06] see God wants to make us a living Army
[1:00:09] yeah I mean see it starts from the
[1:00:11] inside out see many times we just want
[1:00:14] we want others to be made alive what
[1:00:17] about
[1:00:18] us amen now I'm oh yeah
[1:00:21] well let's just jump down to this amen I
[1:00:25] like pictures
[1:00:28] why do you eat
[1:00:30] spreads not just physically if it's too
[1:00:33] much but what you eat see out of the
[1:00:35] Abundant of the heart the mouth
[1:00:38] speaketh right so this this is a this is
[1:00:41] a um you beer eating honey out of a pot
[1:00:44] and we know brother Ram tells a story he
[1:00:46] was hunting once and you know he came
[1:00:48] back and there was a came back to his
[1:00:50] tent and there was a couple of Cubs and
[1:00:51] a mama bear and they basically just
[1:00:53] trashed the whole thing looking for
[1:00:54] something to eat and you know you know
[1:00:56] the mama bear saw him and you know you
[1:00:58] ran off and called the Cubs one of the
[1:01:00] Cubs came but the other one just
[1:01:01] wouldn't move and brother Bram was
[1:01:03] looking uh looking at this Cub and was
[1:01:06] very aware of where the mother was and
[1:01:07] didn't want to get between them and you
[1:01:09] know all all he saw was the back of the
[1:01:11] cub and this Cub had his actually had
[1:01:13] his hand in his molasses jar and was
[1:01:15] putting his hand in and licking in he
[1:01:17] all covered and all covered and you know
[1:01:20] molasses and sticky and all these things
[1:01:21] and and the mama bear finally I think
[1:01:23] either called to the cup went and
[1:01:24] grabbed it and took them off into the
[1:01:26] bushes and then then the mama and the
[1:01:28] other Cub started licking on the one
[1:01:30] that was covered in molasses I mean so
[1:01:32] what was on the Cub spread to the family
[1:01:35] I mean what the Cub was eating spread to
[1:01:37] the family right so if you're eating
[1:01:39] doubt and discouragement and just
[1:01:41] tension and anxiety and social media and
[1:01:43] ideas that's going to spread that
[1:01:45] negative atmosphere is going to spread
[1:01:47] to the family it's not going to be a
[1:01:49] sticky good old molasses am mean joy joy
[1:01:52] joy kind of meal time no but if you feed
[1:01:54] on the word of God
[1:01:56] mean if you feed on his goodness mean it
[1:01:59] will spread it will have an effect am
[1:02:02] mean you can't help it if you just see
[1:02:04] if you're eating on the right thing
[1:02:05] saying Lord I'm not just eating for
[1:02:07] myself but Lord I'm believing in faith
[1:02:09] this is going to spread to my family
[1:02:11] it's going to change the atmosphere of
[1:02:13] my life not just my own thought pattern
[1:02:15] and what's going on in here but it's
[1:02:17] going to spread through the whole house
[1:02:20] Hallelujah so I say the more we eat the
[1:02:22] stickier we'll get Hallelujah and you
[1:02:25] know like a yeah it's amazing like a
[1:02:26] toddler you know you say don't touch the
[1:02:28] walls and they just kind of it's amazing
[1:02:30] how efficient they are they'll touch
[1:02:32] every surface they can yeah it's amazing
[1:02:34] man they're they're efficient and talk
[1:02:37] about productivity there there there
[1:02:39] through the roof when it comes to making
[1:02:40] mess what if we were like that with God
[1:02:43] we're all covered in his goodness
[1:02:45] hallelujah we're just kind of every
[1:02:46] every everything we come in contact with
[1:02:48] we're kind of leaving a trace
[1:02:51] there amen I think we should be that way
[1:02:54] oh but the bones are too dry C no never
[1:02:56] look at your situation that is too hard
[1:02:58] for the
[1:02:59] Lord amen never look at that see we got
[1:03:04] to look to the end of the way now let's
[1:03:05] just go back
[1:03:06] to this
[1:03:08] here now think of some night when life
[1:03:12] is finished Jesus finally comes and we
[1:03:15] go to meet him in the air and that great
[1:03:17] table is set 100,000 miles long and
[1:03:20] across there the old Veterans of the
[1:03:21] field sitting there looking across the
[1:03:22] table to each other see there my brother
[1:03:25] my sister sitting there we're just are
[1:03:27] bound to shed a little tears once in a
[1:03:28] while when I reach across a table and
[1:03:30] take one of them by the hand the tears
[1:03:32] of joy rolling down our cheeks and then
[1:03:34] the king and his Beauty will come out
[1:03:36] and walk down the table and wipe the
[1:03:38] tears away from our eyes let that be our
[1:03:41] motives and having meetings and
[1:03:42] gathering together and talking about him
[1:03:46] hallelujah oh that's just for church no
[1:03:48] that should be everyday life what is
[1:03:50] your motive when you talk to someone
[1:03:52] what is your motive when you speak to
[1:03:54] your family it should be I'm going to
[1:03:56] take you by the hand on the other side
[1:03:57] of the wedding supper table one day I
[1:03:59] mean when life is done and we're we're
[1:04:01] gathered on the other side I'm looking
[1:04:03] to you there I'm not looking to your
[1:04:05] situation here I'm not looking at Dry
[1:04:07] Bones here I'm looking to you fully
[1:04:09] formed over there amen now I'm not just
[1:04:12] saying well yes over there it'll happen
[1:04:15] no the Miracle's got to happen this side
[1:04:17] I mean it's got to come a miracle here
[1:04:18] for that to happen here but it should be
[1:04:20] our motivation should be you know this
[1:04:22] is this is our motive for our meetings
[1:04:25] and gather gathering together and
[1:04:26] talking about him the Lord that the
[1:04:28] Molasses would spread that they' get
[1:04:31] sticky too right amen let that be what
[1:04:36] uh be what we think of him to meet him
[1:04:38] that night look friends don't look at
[1:04:40] things right here look at the end if I
[1:04:43] had to look at things right here in
[1:04:45] front of me I'd be a discouraged person
[1:04:48] but I never look here I watch the end
[1:04:50] now if a prophet could say that if he's
[1:04:52] looking here he gets discouraged but
[1:04:53] he's looking to the end how much more
[1:04:55] you and I because let's be honest we can
[1:04:58] look at here and now and be very
[1:04:59] discouraged we can be troubled we can be
[1:05:01] worried we can be anxious by what we see
[1:05:04] here but if we look to the end and say
[1:05:06] Lord give me a revelation of the end
[1:05:08] give me a revelation of who's going to
[1:05:09] be there in the end that my family's
[1:05:11] going to be there in the end I mean then
[1:05:13] you won't look at the here and now but
[1:05:15] revelation will say you may see this
[1:05:17] with your eyes but the eyes of Faith see
[1:05:18] there amen and revelation will override
[1:05:22] what you see here and now you say well
[1:05:24] you don't know the situation I'm going
[1:05:26] through Ezekiel Saw a valley of dry
[1:05:29] bones right he saw a valley of dry bones
[1:05:33] Lazarus was four days dead in the grave
[1:05:35] don't be cynical about trouble don't be
[1:05:37] cynical well God's not going to do it
[1:05:38] our how no see these bones were said our
[1:05:41] hope is lost our hope is lost I say our
[1:05:44] hope is not lost hope is expectation
[1:05:47] with pleasure the Bible says you know no
[1:05:49] Our Hope see what was their hope their
[1:05:51] hope would be that they'd be living in
[1:05:53] Israel as a redeemed people but because
[1:05:56] they fell into the state then the bones
[1:05:57] are actually saying to Ezekiel basically
[1:05:59] no our hope is lost we we are cut off
[1:06:02] from our parts we've been separated from
[1:06:05] fellowship we're been isolated and all
[1:06:07] these things we can't you know we can
[1:06:08] never overcome these things that's what
[1:06:10] bones say dry bones but hear ye the word
[1:06:13] of the Lord amen don't don't have that
[1:06:15] kind of a testimony no matter what
[1:06:17] you're going through say no God can
[1:06:19] restore prise the Lord amen so our hope
[1:06:22] is not lost see Lazarus was 4 days dead
[1:06:25] in the grave but you see Jesus was there
[1:06:28] but he told Mary and Martha roll the
[1:06:30] stone away and Mary or Martha even
[1:06:33] paused and said but Lord he stinketh
[1:06:34] it's been he's been four days in the
[1:06:36] grave but they had to they had to put
[1:06:39] their faith into action right they had
[1:06:41] to put their faith into action so they
[1:06:43] had an option they could either sit
[1:06:44] there mourning and crying in the house
[1:06:47] or they could go to the master that they
[1:06:49] did but just getting to the master
[1:06:51] wasn't the end of the story right he
[1:06:54] they they took him because because Jesus
[1:06:56] asked them where have you laid him so
[1:06:59] they are taking Jesus to their problem
[1:07:02] right they're not leaving him out in the
[1:07:04] field somewhere they they're bringing
[1:07:05] him to where the problem is right but
[1:07:08] then Jesus says now you roll away the
[1:07:10] stone so now don't just sit there but
[1:07:12] put your faith into action I mean
[1:07:14] believeing because remember they pushed
[1:07:15] the stone away but then they had to
[1:07:18] believe the resurrection and the life
[1:07:19] was going to call him forth right they
[1:07:22] did it in faith but they're completely
[1:07:23] depending on his voice Hallelujah
[1:07:26] speaking to Lazarus and him coming back
[1:07:27] from the grave amen and this is this is
[1:07:30] how we must we must look at every
[1:07:33] circumstance amen that sure we do it in
[1:07:35] faith but we must rely on his word bring
[1:07:38] it to pass amen
[1:07:42] hallelujah amen you
[1:07:45] see the Bible I mean brother Braham says
[1:07:48] that you know we're having a h life
[1:07:49] crisis it seems like home life is
[1:07:52] running out into shallow water and to me
[1:07:55] this is like ezekiel's dry bones is all
[1:07:57] separation you know the devil hates this
[1:08:00] is not rocket science or or anything
[1:08:02] flashbang amazing but the devil hates
[1:08:04] families he hates relationships he hates
[1:08:08] them he hates marriage he hates real
[1:08:11] parent children relationships he hates a
[1:08:14] family unit working because a family
[1:08:17] unit working is a is a is is a symbol of
[1:08:20] God and his family so it's just
[1:08:23] reflecting a true family is reflecting
[1:08:25] what God is with his family in heaven
[1:08:27] right so God loves family the devil
[1:08:30] hates family so of course he's going to
[1:08:32] try and bring us into a home life crisis
[1:08:34] where there's separation there's no
[1:08:36] Unity right and maybe maybe we have that
[1:08:39] going on it doesn't mean it has to stay
[1:08:41] that way you know oh it used to we used
[1:08:44] to do this B we used to pray we used to
[1:08:46] have these family altars we used to but
[1:08:48] now we got too busy rebuild the altar
[1:08:50] amen restore God wants to restore these
[1:08:54] things just because you lose something
[1:08:56] it doesn't mean it's gone forever it
[1:08:58] just means you own it
[1:08:59] twice right you had it once you get it l
[1:09:02] then you get it back now it's twice
[1:09:04] yours amen now it's your now it means
[1:09:06] even more to you I believe when David
[1:09:09] got his wives and his children back they
[1:09:11] would have meant more to him than they
[1:09:13] did before that he loved them he cared
[1:09:15] for them but when they were lost and
[1:09:16] then God restored them by his grace he
[1:09:19] could have said you're twice mine now
[1:09:22] Hallelujah so God can restore anything
[1:09:25] don't don't say no we're dried up our
[1:09:26] hope is gone it's been too long no
[1:09:28] nothing is hopeless nothing is helpless
[1:09:31] amen you see but you see someone's got
[1:09:33] to put faith into action amen you say
[1:09:36] but I've tried that say Lord reveal it
[1:09:39] to me make me
[1:09:41] perseverant amen make me perseverant
[1:09:43] Lord you're going to get resistance amen
[1:09:45] let's be honest of course you're going
[1:09:46] to get resistance cuz the devil don't
[1:09:49] want the pillar of fire moving in your
[1:09:51] house he doesn't want the angels of the
[1:09:53] Lord visiting your house no he wants you
[1:09:55] to be watered off and trouble in your
[1:09:57] mind and just just a prisoner but God
[1:09:59] doesn't want you that way amen that's
[1:10:02] why I say hear ye the word of the Lord
[1:10:04] amen these Dry Bones can live praise the
[1:10:06] Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:10:11] now you see Elijah on Mount carel would
[1:10:15] restore or rebuild the altar of the Lord
[1:10:18] which had fallen down the scripture says
[1:10:20] if I have it here I
[1:10:22] think Elijah say he repaired the altar
[1:10:24] of the Lord that was broken down and
[1:10:27] Elijah took 12 Stones according to the
[1:10:29] number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:10:30] Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:10:32] came saying Israel shall be thy name now
[1:10:35] the stones he built now the altars we we
[1:10:38] build he say how long was that altar
[1:10:41] left uh unattended the word doesn't say
[1:10:45] and let's be fair I mean I mean let's
[1:10:46] just say don't worry about the length of
[1:10:48] time as as as the Lord would say in the
[1:10:51] Book of Joel I will restore all the
[1:10:53] years that the pal worm the Locust the
[1:10:56] caterpillar the can worm ha eaten says
[1:10:58] I'm going to restore all those years
[1:11:00] some maybe maybe someone who heard the
[1:11:02] prophecy of Joel said it's been it's
[1:11:03] been
[1:11:05] decades that those years it's decades
[1:11:07] God's got to repay he'll repay it he'll
[1:11:10] rebuild it he'll restore it right so
[1:11:13] what stones are we using for our altar
[1:11:16] because remember you've got to put your
[1:11:18] sacrifice on
[1:11:19] something Elijah took specific stones
[1:11:22] and he rebuilt the altar of the Lord see
[1:11:26] what are we what are we worshiping upon
[1:11:28] fear worry uncertainty or the revelation
[1:11:32] of the word of God what what altar are
[1:11:35] you building is it frustration is it
[1:11:38] anxiety don't don't put your sacrifice
[1:11:41] on those kind of
[1:11:42] stones amen that's right but the stones
[1:11:45] should be stones of testimony amen see
[1:11:47] see family alar or or Walking with God
[1:11:50] it's not a going through the motions
[1:11:52] kind of a thing it's not a I remember
[1:11:54] having to go to Anglican Chapel three
[1:11:56] times a week at boarding school where
[1:11:57] you stand up and you repeat something
[1:11:59] you sit down you pray this you just go
[1:12:01] through the motions of a religious
[1:12:02] service no but but but worship of God is
[1:12:06] not just going through the motions it's

[1:12:34] it vibrant may be so impactful to you
[1:12:37] some people say man that testimony is a

[1:12:40] greater blessing to you because you're
[1:12:42] in it amen God found you God called you
[1:12:45] amen so it should be our worship should
[1:12:46] be based on stones of testimony amen
[1:12:49] that God has called me even just a call
[1:12:51] of God is a supernatural work I mean you
[1:12:53] could praise God all the way into the
[1:12:55] Rapture because God called you Enoch

[1:14:10] the sacrifice on according to the word
[1:14:12] of the Lord by Revelation see the

[1:14:18] of Baal would do the intimidation the
[1:14:20] noise the worship whatever they're going
[1:14:22] through it didn't move Elijah a bit cuz
[1:14:24] he had reev before he went up the

[1:14:28] the story The Fire fell Hallelujah the

[1:14:50] because when as fire moves people are
[1:14:52] restored amen healing comes revelation

[1:14:57] doesn't want us just to come to church
[1:14:59] and experience the fire he wants you to

[1:15:03] your house you're like that bear cub
[1:15:04] covered in molasses amen it doesn't

[1:15:27] be a victory on God's side amen you got
[1:15:30] to keep that in your mind keep that in
[1:15:31] your heart Lord you're on the offensive
[1:15:34] when you see the devil wearing his head

[1:15:40] make you think oh yeah I'm on the
[1:15:41] defensive no God's made a move now the
[1:15:44] devil's responding amen a castle is
[1:15:47] besieged now the now the Defenders are
[1:15:49] going to respond but the main thing is
[1:15:51] we're not stuck in the walls hiding no

[1:15:55] this one's yours amen
[1:15:59] hallelujah amen rebuild the altar praise
[1:16:01] the Lord because we must realize brother
[1:16:05] B asked this question do you believe
[1:16:07] with all your heart the angel of the
[1:16:08] Lord accompanies the message always he's
[1:16:11] always there where his word is the Angel
[1:16:14] of the Lord the same one that led Israel
[1:16:16] out of Egypt into the promised land the
[1:16:18] same one that visited the prophets down
[1:16:20] through the Old Testament into the New
[1:16:21] Testament because Jehovah of the Old
[1:16:23] Testament the angel of Lord is Jesus
[1:16:25] Christ of the new we know that right but
[1:16:27] he accompanies his word always am me so
[1:16:30] if his word is in your heart he's going
[1:16:33] to accompany you amen if his word has
[1:16:36] been hid in your heart not opinions not
[1:16:38] the doctrines of man not religion but
[1:16:40] the word of the Lord God is put in here
[1:16:43] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[1:16:44] the angel of the Lord will accompany you
[1:16:47] amen and the Lord says in his word that
[1:16:49] the angel of the Lord en encamps about
[1:16:51] those who fear Him and delivers them all
[1:16:54] amen so you got to realize that you're
[1:16:55] not alone you're not a dry bone helpless
[1:16:58] in the field saying how can I live no

[1:17:02] than a bone you're a living person amen
[1:17:04] you've been restored so now the angel of
[1:17:06] the Lord accompanies you wherever you go
[1:17:09] amen sure you'll find trouble but
[1:17:11] trouble's not in you you got to realize
[1:17:12] trouble doesn't belong to you peace
[1:17:14] Belongs to You amen the joy of the Lord
[1:17:16] as Nehemiah would tell the children of
[1:17:18] Israel don't be don't be discouraged
[1:17:20] don't be sorry the joy of the Lord is
[1:17:22] your strength hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:25] why is the joy of the Lord my strength
[1:17:27] because he's revealed to me the end he's
[1:17:30] revealed to me this person's coming in
[1:17:32] he's revealed to me that my children are
[1:17:34] coming home amen that's why the joy of
[1:17:36] the Lord is my strength because the the
[1:17:39] more I rejoice in the Revelation he's
[1:17:40] given me the stronger I
[1:17:43] become Abraham rejoiced in the
[1:17:45] Revelation given to him it was revealed
[1:17:47] to him Isaac's coming that's it amen he
[1:17:49] grew stronger in faith cu the Revelation
[1:17:51] became greater than his five senses what
[1:17:53] he heard what he saw what he felt it was
[1:17:56] greater than the the than the confession
[1:17:57] of Sarah amen and he had a revelation
[1:18:01] that Isaac's coming through her not
[1:18:03] through someone else through her so he
[1:18:05] kept the spiritual atmosphere around him
[1:18:07] brother Bram said amen even on the
[1:18:09] plains of memory Dusty hot not like the
[1:18:11] well watered Plains of Sodom all these
[1:18:13] things Sarah was a bit fussy he yeah you
[1:18:16] know brother r with dramatized but
[1:18:19] Abraham had a revelation my spouse needs
[1:18:22] a
[1:18:23] visitation that was that was his
[1:18:25] Revelation so every morning maybe got up
[1:18:28] and said Lord may my life match that
[1:18:31] Revelation that how I treat her how I
[1:18:34] treat my servants my conduct the
[1:18:36] atmosphere that I carry Lord I Surrender
[1:18:38] myself to that Revelation that you can
[1:18:40] fulfill it amen what cuz his eyes were
[1:18:43] at the end his eyes weren't in the
[1:18:44] circumstances that he was living in
[1:18:46] hallelujah amen and what did that do
[1:18:48] that that Revelation prevailed over the
[1:18:51] deadness of his body prevailed over the
[1:18:53] deadness of her womb prevailed over her
[1:18:55] unbelief amen because she had to come to
[1:18:58] a place where she judged the Lord
[1:19:00] faithful who had promised what what
[1:19:02] happened her heart turned from unbelief
[1:19:04] to Faith right and and how did that
[1:19:07] happen well the Lord came down in
[1:19:08] Genesis 18 had a you know visited
[1:19:11] Abraham in a body of Flesh with two
[1:19:13] angels in flesh as well and and Abraham
[1:19:16] was being spoken to by the Lord the Lord
[1:19:18] said to him according to time of life
[1:19:19] you're going to have the promised son we
[1:19:21] know time of life is a woman's thing not
[1:19:22] a man's thing that was not Abra
[1:19:24] Abraham's visitation that was Sarah's
[1:19:27] visitation right but Abraham because he
[1:19:29] loved the Lord and God had revealed it
[1:19:31] to him he just focused on that
[1:19:34] Revelation is this okay am me because
[1:19:36] God wants us to reveal he wants to
[1:19:38] reveal his word to us that we're not
[1:19:40] walking or or treating others conducting
[1:19:43] Our Lives by what we see taste feel
[1:19:46] smell hear imagine all those things but
[1:19:48] we're conducting our life by the
[1:19:50] revelation of the
[1:19:52] word amen amen
[1:19:55] praise the
[1:19:56] Lord now God now the most important
[1:19:59] thing is don't respond in
[1:20:02] kind Sarah became fussing upset living
[1:20:06] on the plains of memory brother BR would
[1:20:08] dramatized while miss lot has got all
[1:20:09] the nice Caravans went down to Sodom and
[1:20:12] all these clothes and all these nice
[1:20:13] things and you know why are we living
[1:20:15] here and all these things and you know
[1:20:16] but Abraham was there because of
[1:20:18] Revelation it wasn't a human reasoning
[1:20:21] that he lik the desert that he was there
[1:20:22] no it was because of Revelation but did
[1:20:24] not respond in kind right you should
[1:20:27] never fight back as it's given to you
[1:20:31] because that's just the devil dragging
[1:20:33] you down onto his ground and you'll
[1:20:35] never win carnally you never spiritual
[1:20:38] battles are never won carnally they're
[1:20:40] never won in arguments they're never won
[1:20:42] in fussing they're never won in fighting
[1:20:44] they're never won trying to prove your
[1:20:46] point they're never won that way they're
[1:20:48] won spiritually am mean cuz the weapons
[1:20:50] of our Warfare are not carnal they're
[1:20:53] not human understanding they're not
[1:20:54] human wisdom they they're not human
[1:20:56] arguments they're not just m you know
[1:20:58] manipulating emotions that's not how our
[1:21:01] Warfare is won but it's mighty through
[1:21:03] God our weapons to the pulling down of
[1:21:05] strongholds so never respond in kind
[1:21:08] it's never tit fortat okay you should
[1:21:10] never be that way as as um because
[1:21:14] remember you got a revelation I trust
[1:21:16] you have they're coming home okay so
[1:21:18] don't respond how they're treating you
[1:21:20] amen 1 Peter 3:9 not rendering evil for
[1:21:24] evil or ring for riling but contr wise
[1:21:27] blessing knowing that ye are there unto
[1:21:29] called that you should inherit a
[1:21:31] blessing amen so you shouldn't render
[1:21:34] evil for evil just like brother Braham
[1:21:36] gave the testimony and and and I think
[1:21:37] it's Tommy Osborne different ones were
[1:21:39] in that meeting they in Oregon there and
[1:21:41] you know brother br's preaching about
[1:21:42] faith as a substance and then a big
[1:21:45] demon-possessed man came up on the
[1:21:46] platform and he was youo swearing at
[1:21:49] brother BR saying I'm going to tear you
[1:21:50] limb from Limb and the police will there
[1:21:52] different things but brother said no
[1:21:54] leave him alone this is a spiritual
[1:21:55] Affair and the man came up on the
[1:21:57] platform now remember brother Brown was
[1:21:59] a trained boxer before he met the Lord
[1:22:02] so he knew how to use these right but
[1:22:04] there's on the platform this man is way
[1:22:06] taller than you know you know way bigger
[1:22:08] and this man spits in his face and curse
[1:22:10] them all these different things the
[1:22:12] devil's trying to get the prophet to
[1:22:14] respond in
[1:22:15] kind right but he realizes he realizes
[1:22:20] that that it's not him being challenged
[1:22:22] it's the spirit of the Lord being
[1:22:23] challenged amen right it's not his
[1:22:25] Humanity being challenged and his reput
[1:22:27] no it's God being challenged so if God's
[1:22:30] being challenged let God answer the
[1:22:32] challenge right and so so so this man
[1:22:35] said to brother BR I'm going to tear you
[1:22:36] li from limb and then and you know and
[1:22:39] then and then and then the prophet said
[1:22:40] no you're going to fall at my because
[1:22:42] you've challenged the spirit of the
[1:22:43] Living God you're going to fall at my
[1:22:45] feet and the man said I'll show whose
[1:22:46] Feet's going to fall on who and he went
[1:22:48] to try and punch him he just spun around
[1:22:50] and and and fell right at brother Ram's
[1:22:52] feet why because he didn't respond in
[1:22:56] kind let us not respond in kind right
[1:23:00] let us respond spiritually amen amen
[1:23:04] because knowing that ye are there unto
[1:23:06] called that you should inherit a
[1:23:08] blessing what is that blessing
[1:23:10] salvation's come to my house Deliverance
[1:23:13] has come to my house eternal life has
[1:23:15] been imparted isn't that the blessing
[1:23:17] you
[1:23:18] want isn't that the thing you want to
[1:23:20] see amen so don't render evil for evil
[1:23:23] or railing for railing but contr
[1:23:25] blessing knowing that ye are there unto
[1:23:27] called and that you should inherit a
[1:23:28] blessing for he that will love life and
[1:23:31] see good days let him refrain his evil
[1:23:33] uh his tongue from evil and his lips
[1:23:35] that they speak no G amen let him rescue
[1:23:38] evil and do good let him seek peace and
[1:23:41] ensure it amen right I think Lord help
[1:23:44] us amen this is how we should be why
[1:23:46] because we're looking to the end we're
[1:23:47] not looking at the situation we're in
[1:23:49] amen we're looking Beyond with eyes of
[1:23:51] Faith amen a soft answer turneth away
[1:23:53] wrath but G previous words stir up anger
[1:23:57] see what does a what does a Spirit want
[1:23:59] to do it wants to jump on you and then
[1:24:02] it just wants to fight cause you to
[1:24:04] fight right jumps one to another yeah
[1:24:07] that's what it wants to do in a home
[1:24:09] bring in Strife this this trouble comes
[1:24:11] then that Spirit jumps on this person
[1:24:12] because of how they react because
[1:24:13] remember the devil wants emotions to
[1:24:15] rise in order to open a door that he can
[1:24:18] enter in right you look at it this is
[1:24:20] why music and stuff is so popular you
[1:24:22] know your entertainment these days
[1:24:23] because it's such an emotional thing
[1:24:25] that causes people to subconsciously let
[1:24:28] their guard down that that Spirit can
[1:24:29] get into them right and that's the same
[1:24:33] thing with fighting same thing with
[1:24:34] trouble and strife that that that Spirit
[1:24:36] wants to jump on the other person and it
[1:24:39] will affect people
[1:24:40] differently but Can Be The Same
[1:24:43] Spirit right that's right so a soft
[1:24:46] never let never let your emotions
[1:24:49] overrule you say God help me keep my
[1:24:52] emotions in check lord it's not them
[1:24:55] doing this Lord It's pain it's it's
[1:24:58] something but whatever it is we're going
[1:24:59] to take it Lord you're going to take
[1:25:00] this Lord You're Going to overcome this
[1:25:02] thing Lord Jesus I can't do it I've
[1:25:03] tried who's tried let's be honest we've
[1:25:06] all tried but we failed right because we
[1:25:08] tried right but when you let God do it
[1:25:10] through you it's a totally different
[1:25:11] thing amen when you allow the Lord to do

[1:25:29] 40 days stuck in that Valley because of
[1:25:31] Goliath and a boast of one giant one
[1:25:34] giant they stuck and they were stuck in
[1:25:36] their own inheritance it was in Judah

[1:31:24] yeah to be under expectation that God
[1:31:27] will come down in the house and touch I
[1:31:29] mean Christine could stand up and give
[1:31:30] heaps of testimonies of when they were
[1:31:32] young 20 years old young person her and
[1:31:34] Melanie and everyone's praying and her
[1:31:37] brothers would be they' have prayer
[1:31:38] meetings in their room God come down and
[1:31:39] mighty ways and her brothers would be
[1:31:41] sleeping on the outside of the door just
[1:31:43] to be near that presence and they knew
[1:31:45] well the next morning they get up and
[1:31:46] say God came down didn't he last night
[1:31:48] didn't they say things like that they
[1:31:50] all knew when God visited the
[1:31:52] house he still does it
[1:31:54] we don't have to move to Tang to enjoy
[1:31:56] those things no where his people are he
[1:32:00] is amen you say well life has changed
[1:32:03] now things are more
[1:32:05] busy busyness
[1:32:07] doesn't no never ever put a limiting
[1:32:11] factor on when God can visit you amen
[1:32:13] Daniel Daniel had a very high pressure
[1:32:17] role in in in Babylon he was he was the
[1:32:20] president of the presidents and under
[1:32:21] the king all these things high pressure
[1:32:24] but yet God still visited him yeah amen
[1:32:26] Paul was chained to a Roman soldier for
[1:32:28] a long time that's right he got this
[1:32:32] amen well I'm not a church age messenger
[1:32:35] you're the bride of Christ sry amen
[1:32:37] you're the bride of Christ God can still
[1:32:39] come and talk to you just like he talk
[1:32:41] to the Apostle Paul he can reveal his
[1:32:42] word to you like he did him amen amen so
[1:32:45] we cannot say that there's no my
[1:32:47] situation is is outside the ability of
[1:32:50] God reaching down he can reach down
[1:32:52] further than you can look cup amen like
[1:32:55] the Apostle Paul would I mean sorry
[1:32:57] Ezekiel looked at those bones and said
[1:32:58] no this is way too far down and God said
[1:33:01] no no no no no I'll show you I'll show
[1:33:04] you amen the Lord praise the Lord
[1:33:08] Brother R says I believe that all the
[1:33:10] lines are getting
[1:33:12] unclogged uh you know clogged up with
[1:33:14] all kinds of doctrines theologies and
[1:33:16] all kinds of stuff unbelief it's been
[1:33:18] handed down from generation to
[1:33:19] generation amen he says I believe the
[1:33:23] lines are getting unclocked amen amen he
[1:33:26] says your mind opens up and accepts the
[1:33:28] spirit or rejects the spirit you have a
[1:33:30] little conscience and little feelings
[1:33:31] and little Sensations all these things
[1:33:33] that has nothing to do with it that's
[1:33:35] just a little Sensations and things but
[1:33:37] when it comes to reality your mind opens
[1:33:39] it up your mind either accepts it or
[1:33:41] rejects it so that's why when when you
[1:33:44] read the word when you hear a testimony
[1:33:46] hear preaching whatever it is or hear a
[1:33:49] song I wish we had the lyrics of the
[1:33:51] song that you sung Stephanie it's
[1:33:53] powerful amen you'll either accept those
[1:33:55] words or in your mind will say no it's
[1:33:57] too hard or no it can't happen for me I
[1:34:00] would get that and just throw that away
[1:34:03] and say God you can do all things for me
[1:34:05] if you're going to change this body and
[1:34:07] take me into Glory you can do everything
[1:34:09] else less than that amen you can do
[1:34:12] remember because because it'll be the
[1:34:13] greatest Divine Healing will be these
[1:34:16] bodies being transformed and not just to
[1:34:18] be made young again and get old but to
[1:34:19] be transformed he's going to change
[1:34:21] these atoms right that's the greatest
[1:34:22] thing of Divine Healing that's going to
[1:34:24] sweep the world is going to be the
[1:34:25] change in the body now if he has already
[1:34:26] given us the faith for that he can do
[1:34:29] everything else underneath it amen there
[1:34:30] is nothing too hard for the
[1:34:34] Lord I'm not talking things up this is
[1:34:36] just how it is oh yeah I believe it amen
[1:34:39] see you see your mind either accepts it
[1:34:41] or rejects it that's it friends God let
[1:34:43] none of them miss it see it's your mind
[1:34:44] that opens up the doors or closes the
[1:34:46] door and listens to your conscience
[1:34:48] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:34:50] affections but when your mind Clos
[1:34:52] itself to these things and let God the
[1:34:54] spirit of his word come and it blows out
[1:34:57] it blows the rest of the stuff
[1:35:00] out amen so your reason can be clogged
[1:35:02] up with and your memories because of
[1:35:04] disappointments and heartaches of the
[1:35:06] past and your conscious all these things
[1:35:07] but when you lay those things aside and
[1:35:09] say God you said so amen the spirit of
[1:35:11] the word comes and it'll blow that stuff
[1:35:14] out amen every doubt is gone every fear
[1:35:17] is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone
[1:35:19] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:35:21] standing there but the word of God and
[1:35:22] Satan cannot battle against that no sir
[1:35:24] he cannot battle against it now we know
[1:35:27] that that's
[1:35:29] true
[1:35:31] hallelujah amen so we maybe we're just
[1:35:34] going
[1:35:35] to finish right there with
[1:35:39] that but can these bones live can your
[1:35:43] situation be restored absolutely amen
[1:35:45] can it be back to better than what it
[1:35:47] was absolutely God said I will restore
[1:35:50] all the years that the Locust pal will
[1:35:52] can can all the caterpillar have eaten I
[1:35:54] will restore all of them amen then what
[1:35:57] do I do just get
[1:36:01] sticky feed on the word of God and enjoy
[1:36:04] it and say Lord what I'm reading what

[1:36:10] spread to my family so may it change the
[1:36:12] atmosphere in me and then may you now
[1:36:14] change the atmosphere in my home and no
[1:36:17] matter what resistance I get Lord I'm
[1:36:19] not looking at the resistance I'm
[1:36:20] looking at the
[1:36:22] End Amen I'm I'm not looking at the here
[1:36:24] and now you know the kickback I'm
[1:36:26] looking at the end the Lord because
[1:36:27] you've got to believe that the life that
[1:36:29] comes into you his life will make a
[1:36:31] difference right and it does but you
[1:36:34] would have confidence in it that it's
[1:36:35] going to impact those around
