[15:29] Deuteronomy 32 I'm just going to read
[15:34] here
[15:39] Deuteronomy 32 in verse 30 I mean go
[15:53] from verse 30 which is really a couple
[15:55] of just a couple of verses here it says
[16:01] how should one chase a thousand and to
[16:05] put ten thousand to flight except their
[16:08] rock had sold them and the Lord had shut
[16:10] them up for their rock is not our rock
[16:13] even our enemies themselves being judges
[16:16] Amen I just wanted to read that dear
[16:18] the rock is not our rock I mean let's
[16:21] just bow heads in a word of Prayer thank
[16:24] you Lord Jesus that the battle is yours
[16:27] thank you Lord that you do call us to
[16:29] walk out upon the water father to show
[16:31] we have dominion over the works of the
[16:34] devil Lord even our own flesh Lord Jesus
[16:37] we are victorious Lord we thank you that
[16:39] we are overcomers and father's what a
[16:41] commit this time of Prayer into your
[16:43] hands Lord we thank you we serve a
[16:44] supernatural God amen Lord we thank you
[16:47] you are the same yesterday today and
[16:48] forever and you have not changed Lord we
[16:50] think you do not change them just pray
[16:52] father you take these thoughts now and
[16:55] anoint them Lord may you bless our time
[16:57] of Prayer father we thank you we can
[16:59] gather this night Lord and your presence
[17:01] Lord just to let off the pressure we
[17:03] always look forward to the middle of the
[17:05] week Lord just where you can have a Time
[17:06] Lord to set ourselves aside with you and
[17:09] father may you just strength it out in a
[17:11] man Lord may you may your Holy Spirit
[17:13] fall on each heart here and may you do
[17:16] what you want to do in this service Lord
[17:17] may you grant it father bit those who
[17:19] couldn't be here tonight father be their
[17:22] portion laws we
[17:23] want to commit our lives into your hands
[17:24] and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name
[17:26] Amen
[17:28] I think God bless your friends you may
[17:29] have your seats tonight so what I want
[17:32] to speak about the power of unity
[17:35] about how he said that one will chase at
[17:38] the hours and and two will put thousand
[17:40] to flight and so there is power and
[17:42] unity you know one one is not as
[17:46] powerful as two and it says in the book
[17:48] of our believe it's Ecclesiastes that a
[17:50] three-fold cord is not easily broken I
[17:53] mean but one strand or even two strands
[17:56] can be broken easily but a three-fold
[17:58] could not be broken now what do I was
[18:00] thinking about how we have the you know
[18:05] the Lord said there's nothing impossible
[18:07] with us all things are possible to the
[18:09] end of belief so nothing is impossible
[18:11] with you right now brother Branham would
[18:14] speak about he would speak about in a
[18:17] few places he see he says when to
[18:19] omnipotence meet and many times your
[18:23] omnipotent means all-powerful and we
[18:25] know God is all-powerful when we can say
[18:27] you if I said Jesus Christ is omnipotent
[18:29] he's all-powerful
[18:30] there's nothing limited and it can do
[18:32] all things everyone would say Amen right
[18:35] but then if I said the second omnipotent
[18:38] that meets with the other omnipotent as
[18:40] you can you say the same Amen can you
[18:45] say the same amen amen
[18:47] I just want to say you know if I could
[18:49] just lift up what God has made us a
[18:51] little bit we are his workmanship and
[18:54] and he does a good job he does a proper
[18:56] job he doesn't do a half PI job he
[18:59] doesn't do a Kiwi job he does a real job
[19:02] amen so he does so if that's the case we
[19:09] shouldn't shrink back if Jesus himself
[19:12] said nothing's all things are possible
[19:14] to them that believe that means there's
[19:17] nothing limited and what you can do so I
[19:19] believe we shouldn't limit our faith we
[19:22] shouldn't put a limit we shouldn't put a
[19:23] full-stop er in there under that's right
[19:25] after our faith but we should believe
[19:27] that all things are possible and they
[19:29] are possible we know in this hour that
[19:31] God has poured out his spirit and its
[19:34] fullness in this day there is nothing
[19:36] impossible
[19:37] you amen there's absolute power on the
[19:41] believer amen so he says what happens
[19:44] when to omnipotence meet when God and
[19:47] man comes together to omnipotence
[19:49] something's got to shake whatever you
[19:52] say with that creative power of the
[19:54] omnipotence of God knowing that he's
[19:56] promised it and he said it in his word
[19:58] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[20:01] and brings things to pass things that is
[20:04] not it makes him as though they are
[20:06] because to omnipotence have met there he
[20:09] stands overs and he wonderful
[20:11] how many think of when Moses and God
[20:13] came together to omnipotence came
[20:16] together when Moses came to the burning
[20:18] bush it was promised in his word that
[20:20] God would deliver his people I mean to
[20:23] to omnipotence came together
[20:25] hallelujah deals power in the unity when
[20:27] god and manny united together there's
[20:29] nothing can stand before them amen and
[20:32] he winked under egypt an 80 year old man
[20:34] with a stickiness had two young uns and
[20:36] his wife on a donkey walk down into
[20:38] Egypt and he took over nothing stopped
[20:40] him amen he the very purpose he went to
[20:44] Egypt he accomplished that purpose
[20:46] he said well God said through him let my
[20:48] people go and Pharaoh had to let them go
[20:52] hallelujah
[20:53] Moses was perseverant Amen and that's
[20:57] what we need in this days of Buda grit
[20:59] but a determination I mean not just to
[21:02] sit back and say well what will be will
[21:04] be I say no I mean if God's Word says it
[21:08] that'll be that's how it should be I
[21:11] mean it should be in our hearts we are
[21:13] believe we are called to believe all
[21:15] things are possible
[21:16] there is no limit on a man's faith
[21:18] brother Bram said that if there was not
[21:20] a law to stop it you could speak your
[21:22] own private world into existence and go
[21:24] live on it because of God is in you the
[21:27] Creator is in you the one who said let
[21:29] there be Sun Moon the Stars is in you I
[21:31] mean but if there wasn't something
[21:33] holding back that power then it could
[21:34] happen but God doesn't want us to live
[21:37] on our own private world
[21:38] wouldn't it be nice though but he
[21:41] doesn't he hasn't called us to do that
[21:43] but that powers in you yeah yeah now and
[21:49] I'll just read now the ones
[21:51] sound he says now the first thing you
[21:54] know so I said Moses United with God did
[21:58] what he is called to take it all through
[22:00] the scripture amen
[22:02] author of the scripture Joshua Caleb
[22:05] United with God
[22:07] Rahab United with the promise with the
[22:10] token you know the you know the end of
[22:12] the story but she United with
[22:14] omnipotence I mean two of neverland's
[22:16] MIT and the supernatural took place you
[22:18] take it all the way through the
[22:19] scripture and he's the same God today
[22:21] and we're the same kind of believers
[22:23] today because if we were alive back then
[22:25] if we're alive in Moses day we would
[22:27] have gone all the way with Caleb and
[22:29] Joshua took our inheritance we had
[22:31] because we're real believers if we live
[22:33] Noah we would have been in the army time
[22:35] souls would have been saved yeah
[22:36] hallelujah all the way down through amen
[22:39] if you know what David you would have
[22:41] been one of his mighty men you would
[22:42] have been in the kingdom you wouldn't
[22:44] get anything that came against you or
[22:46] David hallelujah you would have been
[22:49] with Elisha Mount Carmel hallelujah you
[22:51] would have been the seventh because
[22:54] you're a real believer thank you
[22:56] hallelujah take it all the way you know
[22:58] you'll be with the wise men you would
[22:59] have been with the Shepherd's you would
[23:00] have been with the apostles I mean you
[23:03] would have been down through wherever
[23:04] the true believe was you would have been
[23:05] there yes and fulfilled what they
[23:07] fulfilled but now we live in another day
[23:10] where God still has believers and his
[23:12] word must be fulfilled so little old
[23:16] Martha came running out there this is
[23:17] from John 11 speaking of the
[23:19] resurrection of Lazarus and she said
[23:21] Lord oh I like that
[23:22] you see she titled him what he was he
[23:25] was her Lord if that would have been
[23:27] here my brother would not have died see
[23:29] even now whatever you ask God God will
[23:32] give it to you nothing uncertain about
[23:33] that no sir see see that's when two
[23:36] positives meet that's when two
[23:39] omnipotence meet see when one omnipotent
[23:42] she had she had perfect omnipotent faith
[23:45] in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see
[23:48] she had perfect
[23:49] infinite faith in Christ that he was the
[23:52] Lord and knowed whatever he asked God
[23:54] God would give it to him in other words
[23:56] she said you just speak the word that's
[23:59] all you have to do whatever you ask God
[24:02] God will give it to you oh that's
[24:04] omnipresent
[24:05] all-powerful because he just said so see
[24:07] all right he was all-powerful and when
[24:11] two powers went to omnipotent powers
[24:13] meet together it's a contact me
[24:16] hallelujah now that's that's on the
[24:21] positive side I solicit I was having
[24:24] fellowship actually father Jean and thus
[24:26] and thus struck me he was speaking about
[24:28] we are where brother Branham was was
[24:31] casting out evil spirits and brother
[24:34] Brown would see the demon power on
[24:35] people and he would call that one and
[24:38] then he'd call out another and he said
[24:40] look can't you see those two spirits are
[24:42] calling out for help and when the one
[24:45] called out for help when the other one
[24:46] tried to help it I mean it was cast out
[24:48] as well hallelujah so now the devil
[24:51] tries to unbelief tries to go to another
[24:53] person a mentoring to to keep hold on
[24:56] the person and means the demon powers
[24:58] combine themselves together to try and
[25:00] reinforce themselves that the person
[25:02] won't receive the promise I mean should
[25:04] they unite right now you know I mean but
[25:08] faith unites as well I mean if two
[25:10] demons can can can't call one to the
[25:12] other help me I'm being inspired help me
[25:15] train me this people run believe the
[25:16] promise help me make this person humbly
[25:19] that they won't accept what's being
[25:20] revealed I mean you have demon path and
[25:23] cool that felt how much more fighting
[25:25] how much more believers people that one
[25:28] to another their faith good contact
[25:31] I need help I'm in my family's way with
[25:34] all their sickness or this trouble of is
[25:35] my metals look whatever it may be I mean
[25:38] how much more when faith connects that's
[25:43] over here we are for a pre-meeting
[25:45] hallelujah I mean there's more than two
[25:48] here it's quite a few believers in this
[25:50] place hallelujah so now our faith should
[25:53] should unite together amen
[25:59] amen unbelief tries to reinforce itself
[26:02] how much more when believers unite
[26:04] together and faith
[26:05] amen and we we are like Martha or Mary
[26:11] we know he is the resurrection and the
[26:14] life we've seen him in this day he's
[26:16] alive he's present right now amen you
[26:19] believe it yes you believe he's present
[26:21] now see with two or three gathered in my
[26:23] name there I am in the midst
[26:26] so he's between you and the person next
[26:28] year he's between you and the person
[26:30] across the room from you he's praising
[26:31] his angels are praising his angels
[26:34] ascend to minister to the ears of
[26:36] salvation I mean so his angels are
[26:38] praising he's present and we're just
[26:40] going to say just unleash your face
[26:42] don't don't reason how's it going to
[26:45] work out God will take care of the
[26:46] working out God does the details we
[26:49] don't need to take your the details we
[26:51] just send forth and we just talk to him
[26:54] in faith amen lift our petitions into
[26:57] his presence and he'll take care of it
[26:59] amen we don't need all how's it gonna
[27:02] happen I don't know I'm not that's not
[27:04] my problem
[27:05] he's in the business of taking care of
[27:07] it not me you just gotta believe in
[27:10] faith it's like a little child I know

[27:13] little charges here daddy

[27:25] they care about
[27:26] I want my lolly I know Jesus said if you
[27:31] had the faith of a little child now
[27:34] that faith is a revelation if you just

[27:39] been revealed it's revealed to these
[27:41] three ones daddy can get it

[28:03] believer does not Evans elect you'll
[28:04] fight we do not intellectually believe
[28:06] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[28:08] today and forever it's been revealed to
[28:10] us
[28:11] Espie he's made himself known that he's
[28:13] alive Amy and no I'm not talking about
[28:16] in 1965 when the Prophet was here but in
[28:18] 2019 the same God that was back there is
[28:22] here and he's revealed himself to you
[28:24] and I declaring himself what you hear on
[28:27] tape on the same God to show you that
[28:30] that that prophet was a genuine prophet

[29:45] cry out and they cry out until finally I
[29:49] meant the parent answers I mean we have
[29:54] to be the same way brother Graham said
[29:55] you know you can put a bail in the end
[29:58] the court and say now

[30:08] his cry and it makes a big noise it's
[30:11] not a dignified it becomes a mess ever
[30:13] seen a little baby that's really been
[30:15] crying it's not an everything and greed
[30:18] and all kinds of things it's not worried
[30:20] about what it looks like it's not
[30:23] worried it just wants something and it
[30:26] will not rest until it gets what it
[30:28] needs and but the problem is we care too
[30:31] much about what other people think of us
