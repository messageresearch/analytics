things in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean Thank You musicians thank you brother Andy amen good evening everyone I mean good to have you one here on this very cold night I trust you all thought out amen so if you got your Bibles handy let's just turn to the Book of Psalms and then we're going to go to Ephesians chapter 1 so just a reminder we're going to have communion and foot washing this Sunday evening and we're gonna have the service around 3:30 so Psalms hundred and seven I love the Book of Psalms just something about the word you know it just gets better it doesn't matter how many times you read it just something just speaks to you a different way or means more to you or you know it's just such a blessing so Psalms 107 read from verse 1 down to verse 8 I give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and as for His mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and that is us we've been redeemed and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the Lord and their trouble and he delivered them out of their distress and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation Amy in the New Jerusalem oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfies the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness hallelujah now Psalms I mean sorry Ephesians chapter 1 and we read a few verses feeds one and we reverse one down to verse seven I mean I love the book of Ephesians don't you I mean Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints Richat are at Ephesus to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ a gauzy according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace and he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen may the Lord bless us would you may have your seat now tonight I want to take a I want to speak a bit about adoption but I want to take a title if I could I'd like to take it from Ephesians 1 and verse 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace I mean so we read there in in Psalms hundred and seven you know that the redeemed of the Lord you know it said let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy we understand from the reading of Scripture and from you know from the message of the hour that truly the redeemed to be redeemed us to be as to be restored back to our original condition that's what it means to be redeemed it's as if that something was your property and it was stolen or you lost it but then you searched around and you found it and if it was stolen and sold to some one else then you would have to buy it back and then it became yours and it came back to its original condition and that's what it means to be redeemed now we understand from the scripture that before there was a son before there was a star or a molecule or anything we were in God's thinking before the foundation of the world and in his great thinking he slew the land before the foundation of the world and so already a way had been made for redemption even before was manifested in time and we read there in Ephesians chapter 1 that we are predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so and then we even read before that that we were that we were chosen according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so when we became a believer you know it wasn't a haphazard thing when God began to call us it wasn't just some some stab in the dark that we were trying to find your peace of trying to find a religion of trying to find a different way of life but it was God calling us it was God drawing us hallelujah amen so when you're like brother Graham says very simply he says he says there's a deep call to the deep and he said if there's that there's a longing in here it's because there's something somewhere calling drawing that longing there's that there's a deep calling to the deep and he says that they had to be at God somewhere an orifice for you to have a longing for that God hallelujah so before there was a longing here there was a God to fulfill that longing hallelujah so that's a glorious thing now we read here that we are predestinated met now notice everything about our Christian walk is for the praise of his glory I mean so everything is done for us as to the praise of his glory so in order you know when we gather you just think about when we gather around the throne that day none of us are going to be standing there in eternity saying praise God my mother and daddy had it that's why I'm here well praise God you know it was just a religion so idea and that's why I'm here it will not be that way it'll be thank you Lord I was lost but then I became found I mean I was wandering in darkness and sin and then you found me a meant you became a reality to me I was sick and then you healed me I mean I was I was lost I was in darkness I was wandering around in darkness and then you found me I'm in my you set me on the right path hallelujah you revealed yourself to me and the ages living in you gave me overcoming power Amen you gave me the faith to rise up above this world hallelujah you placed me in your and yourself Amen you placed me in the body of Christ hallelujah we can have the glorious time I mean thinking about someone who's done so much for us you think about a natural person I mean if you're in debt up to your eyeballs or you know something you could you know if you were facing a firing squad or the electric chair and then someone stepped in and just settled the whole thing and you walked out free you would want to go find that person you'd want to go and brace that person and you'd want to tell them how much you appreciate them times that by Julian billion billion infinities I mean helping worse like we were around the throne Lord you found me I couldn't save myself I couldn't redeem myself I mean I couldn't even be a Christian myself and yet then you came hallelujah then you revealed yourself to me and that's why it's such a blessed thing if there's something in here that says this must be more to life than this I'm not satisfied with with jobs or place the nice things or you know there's got to be more to life your than Joe there's going to be a real peace is going to be a real life if you have that in you you're a blessed person I mean because if there's that in you then there's that there's that to respond and if there's a if there's a a desire for real life is real life to have amen eternal life I might get into that on Sunday cuz I think I'll be thinking through the week what is life what is life is it you know is good life good good situation and in bad life is having bad situations or you know what is life because John says and first job that this worked on he said eternal life which was in the bosom of the Father we held him we beheld him life amen and in the same day life has come again life has been restored and we've handled the word of life hallelujah so you know life is a very different kind of thing but anyway he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children now I just want to break down a few things I've been listening to the adoption series and it's amazing brother branham no this is just me this is what he pens it down to and this is really want to get to he pens it down to well there's just me you have to have confidence the one that's leading you you have to have confidence the one that's leading you ain't meant and you've got to understand that the one that's leading you has a far greater intelligence and wisdom than you do amen it's amazing the Prophet he says really okay I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read you a quote and you'll think this is just funny but I was listening to this driving home the other day I thought this is so profound now he's talking about a pig in a pig pen he's comparing it to humanity he says God by his election grace called you God by his election grace sanctified you colu you God by his election grace and his power baptized you and put you into this land of rest which is the Holy Ghost which they which have entered into this rest have cease from their going astray hallelujah Amen they remember a prophet when he speaks he says sings very deliberately there's a reason why he sees things a certain way he's just not throwing words out there to excite people but prophets say things in specific ways you see the even the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ how he started with the Beatitudes he began to unfold himself down through there was a reason why he preached things in a certain order the same thing with the Apostle Paul the same thing with the Ministry of brother Branham how would unfolded there's a reason for it so there's a reason why things are spoken in such a way they ceased from their works like God did from hers they have unspeakable and full of glory the tree of life is blooming in them they have long-suffering gentle goodness patience made faith faith meekness gentleness and so forth The Tree of Life is blooming in them because their hope is anchored in Christ Jesus this is where the hope is anchored remember I said that is that yet so forgive me we read that first put it can you put that verse up there just leave it Ephesians 1:5 no no can you put up four and five in there because I want to these are the two these are the two take-home thoughts you'd have confidence according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so before anything you were chosen in him and if there's a longing in here it means you were chosen in him if you want more than just the natural life and you want to meet who made me where did I come from it's because it's calling you I mean that you should be holy and without blame before him and love this is what God purposed and what God purposes happens I mean it never you know we have plans and we say we're going to do certain things in it can maybe it doesn't work out but when God sees things they always work out hallelujah I mean so that means I have chosen in him before the foundation of world that I should be wholly without blame before him and love that means the devil can't blame me for anything I mean because the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from all sin so we found in him before him in love okay love divine love governs the Christian life right and having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we found without blame before him and love right and then we're predestinate so our destination is determined that we would be adopted but in the Bible it means a placing of a child the placing of a son in the household right so we are predestinate to be placed in the body where we meet to be hallelujah so our destination has been determined I mean we will come to our adoption to wit the change in the body Alleluia so now it's in love but then the second point is now so the whole the whole Christian walk is governed by divine love and you have to have confidence down the one that's leading you okay so and as I said the third thing is if we're gonna have three points we'll have three points tonight you got to understand his intelligence it's greater his ways he says my ways are greater than your ways my thoughts are greater than your thoughts is what God says in his Bible see saying that my intelligence is far supreme to how you could think I mean he says he said you know the Bible says that the wisdom of God is foolish to man but the wisdom of man is foolish to God so what we think is great and wisdom God says that's foolish yeah hallelujah because this thinking is so much greater than ours okay now where was I so there's those three things you can leave that up there if you wish bearing witness of the Holy Ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the believers these signs shall follow them that believe as they go along they'll heal the sick they'll cast out devils I'll speak with tongues see visions and they walk with God they talk with God no devil can move them their steadfast looking for forgetting those things in the past they press on towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus there they are there they are that's that's pardon me that church it says how do you get there you can't say well Lord do you know one day I started smoking cigarettes and I fell then I thought I'd oh no no no he says predestination he calls us and when we followed him as when we say God we were lost and undone we didn't even have a mind to save oneself we have a nature of a pig I hope this doesn't stand in anyone's feet but now I'll just read this new play I think it's funny but he's saying very profound things in this to me okay we was a nature of a pig we were pigs to begin with so he had a fallen nature when we're born that's what he say you go out to a Pigpen and you look at an old sow and say now lookie here old gal I want to tell you something it's wrong for you to drink slop she'd say oink oink see now that's as much as you have a saving your own self that's exactly you say lady shouldn't we're closed on that you should dress neatly you should do this you shouldn't go to this you should you should not have these car parties you shouldn't smoke cigarettes you shouldn't do this Messer you shouldn't carry on he'd say I think I belong to the oink-oink uh-huh that's just as much as they know then that sounds funny doesn't it wait hold on well I know well I'll tell you I'll let you know I'm just as good as you are oink oink see they reject the leadership of the holy ghost for the Bible said that if you love the world of things of the world the love of God is not even in you now when I heard that the first time I laughed for these guys I'm I belong the ointment cause he's saying it's a man talking to a pig but what he's saying is his God comes to the Pigpen which is this world and he looks down at humanity and he's and he's actually trying to tell you there's a better way to look there's a higher way of living you don't have to live in this slop you don't have to eat the scraps from from the table of the world you know mine tell you think of a farmer as fast smart even the dumbest farmer is way smarter than a pig you can take some ignorant guy who can't read or write write as our name he is far more intelligent than a pig all the pig knows how to do is eat right roll around in the mud when they're hot have asleep you know we lived we lived for a couple years my parents lived outside of Cambridge on this they rented this place but was in the country and one Christmas holidays I was sleeping in a tent on the lawn because there's no room in the house and over the fence there was this big fat couldn t Cooney pick and there were three sheep and the noise as I heard from that pig it just walked around this is literally all it did have you've seen a pig just all day walking eating eating walking eating just just unstoppable and then it would find its place under the trees it just rolled laughing it didn't even need to kind of fall over it just kind of rolled and it was on its side and then roll back up and it kept eating and that's all it did that sounds ridiculous doesn't it do you think what a silly pig doing that kind of thing but here's the stinger the this is how God sees us without him because we're just wandering around in our little paddock or just eating trying to find something to eat find somewhere comfortable to live you know just walking around being basically an animal but then he comes to the fence he says now mr. wink like this has been away he's showing that you say it's a silly story now it's not because God's intelligence it's greater than a pig's intelligence he's saying if and he's and he's to me he's going along those lines is because he says straight up as I said he says they reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost so he's saying the Holy Ghost comes down to them this is how God sees them just like a pig in a pig sty but the leadership of the Holy Ghost wants to take them take us lift us up out of the pig sty amen give us a new mind a new way of thinking Alleluia a new life and you I mean that a fallen nature is not in you anymore but the nature of God himself the very life of God Himself comes unto you I mean then you stand on your feet and you don't go one going anymore I mean you don't live that kind of life anymore but the same intelligence that's in the farmer comes unto you Alleluia so the same same thinking the same way that God views things and those things you begin to do hallelujah amen they reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost for the Bible said if you love the world or the things the world the love of God is not even in you I mean that's an that's an um that's an adoption part - 1960 so we read now and I won't be too long though right there in the scripture in Ephesians 1:5 so now if that pig as I've said before us like a shepherd he is our Shepherd it says Jesus is I'm the great Shepherd now if that sheep understands that this this thing on two legs because the Sheep was just like a you know when it comes to intelligence a sheep is not a smart thing a sheep has you know you drive along you see them on the hills and they're running along and well you know and I just think if there are some Wolf's or any kind of kind of predator man yeah man you have a pedicure chic and you look after those sheep you just eat one at a time you'll live like a king because they can't get away they have no defense I mean they're dominant animals sometimes they get caught in the bushes with their wool if they're as helpless as helpless can be and God God sees this is how our condition is right we are sheep and we've all gone astray the bible says but here's the Shepherd of our souls so if we've gone wayward then he is not satisfied with just ninety and nine sheep and the sheep and the Sheep pen but he goes out and finds that one hallelujah and it should be the same heart should be in us I mean we shouldn't be satisfied with well this person saved will this person say what about some sheep that's gone astray I mean so like so if the sheep now it's like David looking after sheep if those sheep was smart I'd say I'm going to stay close to him not because he just plays a hot real good but I recognize he's going to slingshot Amen he can he can if he's killed the line and he killed a bear he can take care of me right and then a shepherd can see further and higher than where the sheep are because the sheep was just down here and if the grass is a bit long they're not going to see too good but a ship is standing up he can scan around he's got this perception you know a prey item they have their eyes on the side of their head they don't have good depth perception they can look around but they can't tell because if you don't get depth perception you can't tell how far away things are you follow me but uh but a shepherd with his eyes here they have a better measure of distance so they can see the enemies this far away or he's right here the Sheep is just going bad just walking along oh he's there are no he's far away I'm fine but he can be right there you following me right so sheep needs to understand this Shepherd has greater intelligence than me I can't even think like him sheep can't think like us I know this is very basic we got to think about it a sheep cannot think human thoughts they cannot think I wonder what the wind is going to do tomorrow I wonder if I should move to this other paddock or I wonder if I need to put food on this paddock but I wonder if I need to dag these sheep or I wonder when lambing season is going to come if I need to move the separate they use in the and the RAM so you know he can't think like that I wonder if I need to get the shearing gang in next week and you know sheep don't think like that they walk along and they hate their eat their grass and do sheep thinks it's the same thing with us now I'm saying these things it's because you've got to recognize we are sheep but God doesn't want to keep us as as as separate from him right he wants to lift us up by the blood of Jesus Christ so it says in the Bible where joint heirs with Christ I mean that means him where he is his level we become the same as him that's a joint heir right so he wants to take us from that kind of thinking human thinking which is way down here and his thoughts away up here it was elevate our thinking's as thinking in our thinking of the same Amen because adoption as I said is the placing now if the sheep has confidence in the shepherd they'll stay by the shepherd they won't try and fight their own battles right they won't try and sort out their own problems they'll go straight to the shepherd if they're sick or they have another sheep that's sick they'll take that sheep and they'll take it to the Shepherd because in a script bag he's got the honey to put on the rock I mean he's got one he's got the medicine and if there's a predator around they don't feel too safe I mean they'll go to the you know they'll go to the Shepherd because he's got stones to kill the enemy Alleluia but if the Sheep does not have confidence in the shepherd they'll try and sort it out themselves and it's the same thing with us as I said you've got to have confidence and the one that's leading you and the one that's leading us is the Holy Ghost right amen so now let's go to Galatians 4 and we're going to read a bit about adoption but before we read that before we read that I want to really quote from a position of a believer in Christ I just like this and if you plant and if you plant and this little tree begins to draw it just drinks till it can't drink no more then drink more than that and it pushes out then move more and more fruit bushels and bushels of oranges and when a man comes into Christ it doesn't first get your oranges you get the tree and the tree is planted in Christ Jesus the inexhaustible fountain of life and in every and and everything that a believer has has to do after he's placed in Christ Jesus everything he has need of in this earthly journey is given to him when he's placed in Christ and all he has to do is drink and drink and push out and drink until every fruit of the Spirit every gift of the Spirit everything that's in Christ Jesus that belongs to you will be in you for the entire journey and I read that because you've got to understand everything we have need overs in him so if you stay close to him I mean if you have confidence in him guiding you then you'll get what you need I mean but that's why I believe just spend time in the word spend time in prayer just drink drink from the fountain and drink strength from the fountain Alleluia and just push out you know a tree has to drink more water than it needs in order to grow amen it's like a child if you just give it if you give it exactly the amount of food it needs to survive it's not going to grow too well amen but if you give it more food it'll grow hallelujah so that's why we need a full diet of this word I mean we need a full course I just don't want it on tray I don't want some garnish hello amen I want the whole thing and the garnish - Galatians 4 and 1 it's got equations 4 and 1 and we read down to verse 6 he says now I say that an ear as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all she's saying in ear so a child that's born into the family though he is part of the family he is not different from a servant at that point but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption or placing of sons and because he our sons so notice he says because he's not well I should just read it because she are sons god sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ever father or my father my father so you did not become when you received the Spirit who's got the Spirit of the Lord on them the Living God comes and dwells in you amen that's it he's saying here you do not become a son or a daughter of God when God comes and dwells on you he says because you are one of them one of them one of them amen because you are one of them he comes and lives in you I mean because remember God is searching over the earth to find his children and when he finds us children he lays claim on his children amen he says this one's mine in any place claim on them because he fills them with this with a spirit amen he died on Calvary in order to claim you hallelujah amen so that's why he says now that we're under the bondage of the elements of the world amen it was a once upon a time we were slaves to the world we're slaves to our society to our culture to our first birth our first way of thinking amen but then God came so we were sheep we were pigs in the Pigpen we're under the elements of the elements of the Pigpen but then the farmer came hallelujah and he spoke a word into this earth he following me I don't care if you've heard it a million times getting here two million and one it does your good I mean so now and then say came this way that's why it's so amazing the prophet's ministry it's not william branham it's not William Brennan's ministry it's God steps into the vessel and speaks it's like Paul writing the epistles that's not Paul writing that's God writing it wasn't Moses writing Genesis God wrote Genesis through Moses wasn't jeremiah writing it was God writing through Jeremiah it wasn't the Sam's were not David they were God through David all the way down through the Bible this is God riding through human scribes amen so it's not it's not man it's not man's doing it's God's doing so he's saying because you were this way but then God sent forth his son I'm so glad he did I mean he was born into the human race became our kinsman amen to redeem them there under the law we were under the law but he came to redeem us rendre a mention we're not under the penalty of death anymore hallelujah but to restore us back to our original possession hallelujah this means something to me I meant and because I mean that we might receive the placing now Adam before the fall was in his position as God over the earth hallelujah he had dominion god created all things he made he made man as a spirit man made it him in His image he said have dominion over the earth and he put that spirit man into a body called Adam hallelujah and then he was God over the earth he was in his position right and then so now God is calling now that he's went when the fall came he says I'll not leave my children this way under the elements of the world but I will redeem them back to the way back when they have a what they fell from hallelujah amen so everything Adam lost now the position Adam was in has the man and woman have to be restored back to that position I mean that's why the second Adam when he came Jesus Christ he had dominion over nature hid dominion over all the devils hallelujah everything that could be named or his name must bow to the name of Jesus Christ he proved that I am I am in my position hallelujah I have dominion Adam had dominion he proved it right but that was a lived example to show you this is what I'm going to make you hallelujah and that's why brother Branham Winnie you should go listen to the rising of the Sun hallelujah I love that sermon I love that message is more than just a more than just an Easter message but he takes the he takes from Leviticus and he takes about the wave sheaf offering Allu yeah and what they did is they had a field of corn or or or barley whatever it was and they would cut down the mature part of the field because because grain if you look at a field it doesn't grow doesn't mature the same level just like the believer hallelujah but we're growing that's the main thing as long as you're growing and so it cuts down the mature part and the priest would wave it before the Lord giving thanks saying thank you Lord the rest of the field will become like this hallelujah and then Jesus was the mature part of the field I mean the fullness of God it boldly came into wealth in a man he has cut down at Calvary waves before the Lord hallelujah amen at a Thanksgiving to God saying your people will come forth like this and then your people will be made in this image your people will live the same kind of life your people will have the same nature hallelujah then brother Brahim says now it's the rising of the Sun again the Esso in has risen Jesus Christ he says in this day the Son of Man Jesus Christ will be revealed again wholly in Luke 17 30 and he and it was shown year after year message after message was shown in his ministry he says now what is this it's that quickening power Hurley the life of God manifested the light of God being displayed again they said now this this life is being waved before a generation hallelujah and we behold that we're in the field member the earth earth is the field hallelujah and this and his weeds and all kinds of crazy stuff but this week in the field amen as long as your wheat and you look up and you see a priest hallelujah waving that and there's something and you say I'm going to be I'm going to come forth I mean because the same life that was in him as in me Polly I may be green it may be this big it doesn't matter him in the field I mean I'm growing into his image hallelujah and that was God promising you see this you see this life hallelujah this will manifest I mean this will be reproduced into people hallelujah so Adam was in his position adopted placed in his position over the earth amen and it'd be the same thing must happen to us amen the same thing must happen remember it's not you can that's doing it to searle life I trust there's a life in you partly because if there's that life and you you'll come to your you'll come to your adoption but you've got to remember you say well I don't know what it means to be placed in the body I'll tell you you'll find yourself in that position before you even realize it amen and you've got to recognize that's like kale you know and the Old Testament yeah we've got heaps of time and the Old Testament you know here was here was Israel and now we're going to come and be placed in the promised land certain certain tribes were placed in different places and the and the we know the promised land was a shadow of us being placed in the Holy Ghost in the New Testament because that was their inheritance right and so here comes Caleb now remember he he crosses Jordan he's been waiting 40 years he's 80 years old girl whatever crosses Jordan hallelujah 40 years ago I saw my my adoption I saw my resurrection mountain he crosses Jordan he defeats every enemy he comes against poly he comes as he's 84 years old he comes to Joshua he says I've been fighting how lujah remember he had the power he had the overcoming power he had the victory when he crossed Jordan he had the victory when he saw the land forty years before I say he had the victory when he came out of the came out of Egypt under the shed blood parlor he had the victory when he crossed the Red Sea he had confidence and who was I mean he knew it wasn't Moses speaking he knew it was God I mean that's why he followed that word as close as he could hallelujah something anchored in his soul this is going to take me in amen and that was now that was now has leader it wasn't Moses as God and Moses Ali wasn't the 80 year old man who to win unto Egypt as God in a man I'm gonna take my children they were under that they were they were under the bondage of the world the elements of the world I'm not gonna leave them there I'm gonna place them in their land place them in their inheritance amen so remember I said you could have confidence the one that that's leading you and because Caleb and Joshua there were other people corn dazed and raised up Balaam came out of nowhere did the things they did they stuck to thanks doc right by Moses because I knew here was here was God in this man amen the Bible says they were of a different spirit than the other ones I mention that being personally led by the one that was in Moses was personally leading them and you got to have confidence who's leading you amen because if you have confidence the one that's leading you you're going to get there because we're found as we read in Ephesians found in him in love without blame Amen so now love governing your walk but then you've got to have confidence the work he started he's going to perfect he's going to finish hallelujah so here he was sorry I need a bit of this here he was I'm 84 years old you gotta read it I'm 84 years old you know I'm as strong as I wasn't there I left Egypt give me this mountain so here he comes he's coming because he's going to be placed in the land under the ministry of Joshua I mean we've received a Joshua ministry in this day this means that you'll place you remember this message has a life of its own this Bible has a life of its own yes this is not ink on paper only this is the mind of everything God has has been recorded in this word I mean when you open this you're reading God and printful think about hallelujah God has revealed in this word and to hearing what so he says give me my give me my placing in the body hee hee oh he didn't start overcoming when he was placed he was overcoming before he was play he following me everything you have needed her so I read that quote from the position of the believer in Christ everything you have nito for your earthly journey is in you a man when you receive the Holy Ghost it just got a grown mature hallelujah so now we have to have confidence they had confidence in their leader which was not Moses he was what he was but it was God leading Moses right so they had confidence now that he would take them all the way we are more than able and then Moses was taken off the seat and to show to Caleb and the others that it's not just the man versus spirit leading the man he took Moses off the scene he brought just sure to come and finish the part of the work to place them in the land but the same God that was leading Moses lead lead Joshua hallelujah and Caleb got his adoption now you have to have let's go to Romans 8 22 and 23 just want to read this as well because the fullness of the adoption which will read as what we've been looking for that we could spend more time on that we'll go to Romans 8 22 and 23 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and painting together until now all of nature is groaning thirsty yo they're hungry for life they know you know the earth is fallen and not only they but ourselves also which had the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body and this way you know like Abraham he said I'm a pilgrim and a stranger he wasn't satisfied with this with this earthly journey he knew there was a city he was going to dwell in he was looking for that city he was even walking where that city was going to come down on the New Jerusalem there was something in him saying this mortal from this I'm not satisfied with justice I'm looking for a city and he was looking for the city because he meant the king of the city he met Malka sonic and brother Brad was standing 1965 and he said to the question who is this melchizedek he didn't say who was melchizedek who was this one and he showed Jesus Christ as Melchizedek they said now that same one is present howling supernaturally proved he's the high priest and touched by the feeling of your infirmity and God came down supernaturally to prove what the Prophet said was true I mean I am Melchizedek Jesus and I'm present Amen so therefore if we have met the author of the word Amen if we've met Jesus Christ who's met Jesus Christ you are the heaven heaven I trust you have if you have you met Malka Sadiq and there's something in you saying that's why we grow I've met the king I met the king of the New Jerusalem I'm not satisfied with being on here I want to go to that City hallelujah cuz the reason that you're groaning is because he came in Mitch and he's telling you you have a place in the city hallelujah hey if I got told I ever mentioned somewhere awesome I'd want to go that's an earthly thing this is you can't even compare people try and express how great heaven is the Prophet couldn't express that he went there came back changed his life the Apostle Paul couldn't speak about it for 15 years is translated up it came back down it's so glorious hallelujah that's why we groan not because the world is just the evil it's more than that is something and you're saying Lord I want to be where you are I feel your presence and you move and you touch me and you speak to me and it's so glorious but you don't want to be where you are hallelujah I trust that your hearts cry I mean there should be a pull hallelujah towards the Lord and that's why we feel such a feeling that comes over us from time to time as you recognize Amen there's more to life than this hallelujah just beyond the veil Amen I want to see your face what produces that feeling I asked you that question what produces that feeling you can be walking down the street you can be at work you can be in your car you can be in your bed you can be at church you can be playing kicking the ball around with the boys whatever you're doing there's something and you're king of war I'm with your kids but something just comes over you what is it what makes that feeling that's God that's Jesus Christ brooding over you brother Graham says sometimes it feels you feel such a sweet humble feeling come over you he says that's angels that's angels coming around you that's not crazy we believe in a supernatural world don't we amen there you go by feeling no I do not but feeling comes with it just like love is not a word it's a feeling and it changes your life if you love someone your whole life has changed because you love them Alleluia now I'm glad we grown we have a longing it's not because we're getting older it's because we want these bodies to be changed because we know something's got ahold of our souls and now we want these bodies to be changed don't you want to be where he is amen you can take this whole world I want Jesus amen you can take this whole world I don't care amen waiting for the fullness adoption is the redemption the change of this body Alleluia now we read in Galatians about how we're under tutors until the time appointed now brother Graham says now as I said in the beginning adoption is all about we're motivated by love you have to have confidence the one that's guiding you okay he says now now let's change the picture now to me this is very profound as well now the father his sons a good boy he's just dramatizing his sons a good boy his father's right along here's a tutor the Holy Spirit which way the Holy Spirit he says I'm going to walk the tutor said I'm going to walk the child said I'll walk right with you I'll be worth you so is dramatizing two people once the tutor leading the child the other one's the child coming to adoption okay and the tutor says oh the hill is awful hi son but then the child says I'll go right with you I got confidence in you if I start getting tired he'll raise my hand up and hold me on but there's lines up the hill there doesn't matter as long as you're around don't make a bit of difference I'm walking right along with you I mean there's trouble up there they're slick rocks I don't care as long as you're holding my hand I'll walk right with you I'll walk right with you look what he's saying he's showing that the that the son has confidence and the one leading a men and this is a son that actually gets a get gets adopted right now oh you know what your dad used to do that see that's good yes sir they get up on the hill they're always said you know what father your son is just like a chip off the old block here's absolutely exactly like you every word you say he says amen to it I had him turn over in the Bible the other that said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know what he said he screamed and throw his hands up in the air said hallelujah amen and oh and you know it's it in your word the works that he the works he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yeah I remember writing that one to my son y'all remember riding that old when he saw that he just screamed and jumped up and hold hallelujah Amen take all the world out of me make me like that yes sir and all those things that he has done and then the father says my sons ready hallelujah so he say now the one that goes to the adoption he has confidence the one leading him oh yeah and you have to have the same thing oh we're going to go through this trial well as long as I know you're holding my hand Amen you're gonna go through this dark place though I walk through the valley of the shadow death with me they robbed my staff they comfort me all the days of my life Alleluia I mean because he leads us through but you have to have confidence and the one leading you Alleluia are you following me amen that is that I trust it's in your heart amen wherever he leads me I will follow hallelujah over high mountains down through valleys through the fire through the flood wherever it is amen he's gonna lead me through I mean remember the seat to me this is this is this is profoundest because the the Sun he doesn't say well I'm young I can do it he says as long as you're with me I'll be okay because I have confidence in you hallelujah amen we have some musicians to come do you have confidence I'm just good I just because I want to have a real kind of take home thought do you have confidence the one leading you well it's getting awful tight I don't know how we're gonna make it through but who you looking at who you follow it who do you have confidence in amen because if you have confidence in him now you'll turn out all right and he'll say he's exactly like you father he believes your word he doesn't care what other people say more than you all he wants to do is please you amen you have to have confidence in the shepherd now the shepherd is the Holy Ghost hallelujah Amen friends we're going through we're going through you I believe we're going to make it I mean God is so real in this end time and because he's one to show you what you're following is not cunningly devised fables of man but the author of the word has come to reveal this member this is not a textbook we don't have to learn it we don't have to study it from a human standpoint you know I've said before I remember when I was at University studied biochem Street I should I should maybe put a picture up one day there's the Kim the the molecular mechanism of how blood binds oxygen and how the whole active site changes when oxygen is bound then how it changes when it's loosed and how it changes the it changes the what I call the the whole chemical attraction of it changes because the structure changes when when oxygen is bound it's a very complicated thing professor puts it up and sees it so well-designed this the words it's so well design would they say there's a god not in their life so they've studied something so so much they become blind because they're looking at nature because that would say to me how's that made I should show you a picture it's actually quite fascinating you know because there's an iron there's an iron molecule and this and this nitrogen ring and it moves up and down based on when the ions bound the whole active Scyther of the blood changes the whole thing and to me I'd say that's God something made this and it cuz it works it doesn't just hold on to oxygen just hold on to it lets it go and then it gets it again there lets it go and transports it and then baby yo you know this hemoglobin this myoglobin different different your blood is made for different things that's amazing so well-designed they don't believe there's a god because they've studied something so much they've become I'd say foolish yeah and people have studied this so much they miss their very Creator trying to speak out of it that's why it to me this is not a text book you say Lord speak to me out of your word he says well be waiting for you to ask that from us and see how I will and he does hallelujah because that's now the tutor trying to get a hold of you saying now I'm going to take you by the hand now I'm gonna lead you and place you in my body hallelujah but if you hold on you got a string to your will say Lord take my life make it lying there now the tutor can use you you know how these those kids in class they were cut up the ice they never want to do what the teacher says they don't get too far in exams when it really comes to crunch time when these real exams those ones that throw stuff and they cut up and stuff man just write a big fat F and send you on your way why because they're not yielded to the tutor because the tutor or the teacher has a has something in their mind I want to teach this to them because it will help them it's just natural things it's that I'll never use calculus in real life some people do you never know you know so but it's those those students that really say I want to learn something I want to learn this they really get the full benefit and then they can really use what they learn amen let's just stand shall we you love the Lord tonight hey man we are you say well yes just take what you have who's on the Lord side Amen just walk with Him have confidence in your shepherd the Holy Ghost he's got a person he lead you eight men and he is not a goat it doesn't lead you to the slaughter a man I'd like to sing we're more we're able to go up and take the country I mean we have an inheritance and Jesus Christ let's not Plateau there's not get comfortable what would it be like if you're there with with Israel you crossed Jordan supernaturally you put about two steps on the bank and maybe here's the bank of the Jordan and you stop put your tent out here put your fishing pole in the river you know and someone come along and look at you say you're in the tribe of Dan yeah I'm and Dan you're not meant to be here what do you mean I'm in the land no no you mean to be over there no but I'm in the land but you want to stay here I'm happy here but there's victories to him you know what if what if Caleb just crossed over it said I'm gonna make me a houseboat and I'm gonna be right here I know forgive me if I sound ridiculous but what if he just said that he would never have got his resurrection Mountain I mean so don't just satisfy with I'm happy being saved pressin isn't the title deed is being given all that Adam lost has been restored to the church why should we just sit back and say that's nice now hey if there's an inheritance being left up for me where is it what is it where is it and why don't I have it amen that's how it should be we're more than able brother in our own program says he says there's untapped resources in Jesus Christ there's untapped resources it's like a mountain full of gold and no one's minded amen and then there's many places in the world where the place has been mined out and they start mining through the dumps of the rock they discarded and they find these valuable stuff in there I mean I've been to a place just north of Vancouver Squamish there's called is this mine now a mining copper and stuff and they just dumped all of this mud and slurry just out into the bay everywhere and they begin to a years later they look at this stuff and there's gold silver there's more valuable stuff and that than there was what they're getting in the in the first place it's the same thing you say well I've mined all this go back and look I've heard every tape go back
