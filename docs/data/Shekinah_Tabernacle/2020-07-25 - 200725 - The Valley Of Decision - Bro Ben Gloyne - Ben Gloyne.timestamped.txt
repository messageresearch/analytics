[18:33] Yes, it's mine.
[18:37] Amen.
[18:40] Amen. You can take your seats. Um this
[18:42] morning I actually have a a testimony or
[18:47] like a
[18:49] it's something I
[18:54] do funny things now and then
[18:59] I I just want to tell you something that
[19:00] happened because I like to um
[19:03] sometimes publicly say these things then
[19:06] they stick.
[19:10] Is that all right?
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. I I'll be like about five minutes.
[19:17] Um,
[19:20] so I'll just take this off. It's a bit
[19:24] guitary.
[19:29] So this is about the thing that I'm
[19:30] doing making the film. I just want to
[19:32] say something about it. Um,
[19:36] so each one of us, we all have a purpose
[19:38] or a calling that we are called to do.
[19:41] We we're not here just to fill a spot.
[19:44] We have a plan and a calling and a
[19:47] purpose. And
[19:49] mine I've always had this thing in my
[19:50] mind is mine was always going to be to
[19:53] do something
[19:55] more so than what I mean is not just be
[19:57] something, but to do something, which
[19:58] means I start here, I do something, I
[20:00] finish here, then I'm happy, you know.
[20:04] Um and I guess
[20:10] that's I have had opportunity to do easy
[20:14] earth things but they haven't appealed
[20:15] to me and I've probably um
[20:20] uh in some ways made my life slightly
[20:22] hard because I haven't settled for like
[20:25] a certain hill that maybe other people
[20:27] might settle for. I think in some ways
[20:30] I've been jealous of people that can
[20:31] settle for a certain hill and think,
[20:32] man, I wish I could settle on that hill.
[20:35] But, you know, I'd often say, I'm not
[20:37] dying on that hill, man. I I can't.
[20:41] So, often times I've walked away from
[20:43] things that maybe I should have stayed
[20:45] with and made life easier. But
[20:48] when the idea came to do the movie, I
[20:52] thought to myself, now that's a hill I'd
[20:54] like to go and climb.
[20:56] Because it seemed like quite a big hill
[20:58] to do considering at the time 12, 13, 14
[21:01] years ago, I knew nothing about film
[21:02] whatsoever.
[21:05] Um,
[21:07] and I just will say this because it ties
[21:10] in with what I'm saying. There's I have
[21:11] another annoying trait that I just can't
[21:12] seem to quit sometimes. You know,
[21:14] there's no button there to go just quit.
[21:16] You know, some days you I think, Lord, I
[21:18] wish I could just quit. It's quit
[21:20] button. But it, you know,
[21:24] you end up when you should quit, you end
[21:25] up waking up the next day and doing the
[21:27] opposite. You think, is that all you
[21:28] got? Bring it on. You go even harder the
[21:30] other way. And it's it's
[21:33] you know, you can't help being like
[21:35] that. It just is the way that it works.
[21:36] It's um
[21:39] But back to the hill idea. When I think
[21:43] of that in my mind, I think this hill
[21:45] that's in reference to my life, it's the
[21:47] biggest hill that I've got to climb. So
[21:49] then I thought that's kind of like Mount
[21:51] Everest. I would type it to, you know,
[21:53] cuz I think naturally what's the biggest
[21:55] hill that we could look at and that
[21:57] would be the biggest hill that you see.
[22:00] Okay,
[22:03] I've got a little story, a little thing
[22:05] that happened. So this here, see that
[22:08] peak up the top there? That's Mount
[22:09] Everest. It's nestled among all this
[22:13] the Himalayan mountain range there about
[22:15] 29 and a half thousand feet. If you had
[22:18] a if you were cruising a Boeing 747,
[22:21] you'd hit it.
[22:23] You have to go up a little higher. Um,
[22:27] brother Bradam wrote a poem
[22:30] when he was younger and it was he wrote
[22:32] it about I'm lone Samosa lo for that far
[22:34] away southwest.
[22:36] And then the the end of the poem he
[22:38] said, "Somewhere in the distance I can
[22:40] hear a lion wine in those far off
[22:44] Catalina mountains on the Arizona line."
[22:47] Now he was over in Jeffersonville and
[22:49] this was west which were the Catalina
[22:52] Mountains in Arizona. And so he always
[22:54] thought about going there and then one
[22:55] day he was hunting there and he heard a
[22:57] lion wine and he realized you know that
[23:00] poem I wrote was a prophetic poem. I'm
[23:02] now living out that poem. I'm I'm on the
[23:04] in the Catalina mountains on the Arizona
[23:06] line and I can hear in the distance I
[23:07] can hear a lion whine. So he wrote this
[23:10] poetic he wrote this poem that was
[23:12] prophetic.
[23:14] So about knowing this thing about
[23:16] Everest, I've wrote this song and I
[23:19] called it Ed
[23:22] because if you know if you don't know
[23:24] the first man to climb Mount Everest
[23:28] officially that we know of was Edund
[23:30] Hillary which was a New Zealand guy in
[23:32] 1953.
[23:34] and and just typing his him to doing
[23:37] that was what I thought my thing is, you
[23:38] know. So, you just write this I wrote
[23:40] this prophetic song. Can I read you the
[23:43] words to the song?
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, it's um this was like six
[23:47] years ago. The song goes, "Ed is going
[23:50] to go for a big walk. He's going to walk
[23:51] to the top of the world, leave all the
[23:53] bees with his brother and his daddy, and
[23:55] go and see the Nepoese because he was a
[23:57] beekeeper."
[23:59] And then at the start of the expedition,
[24:01] they all met up in Catmandeue. Then they
[24:04] hiked to the base of the mighty
[24:05] Himalayas, the monster they were walking
[24:07] into. But the monsoon rains were coming
[24:10] and Mr. Hunt said, "We best get running.
[24:12] If they beat us to the top, then we'll
[24:13] all be packing up and you'll be going
[24:14] back home to your mummies."
[24:17] This happened.
[24:19] But Ed said, "I I didn't come this far
[24:22] to give up now. I can see the
[24:24] mountaintop, and I won't stop until I
[24:26] knock it knock it knock it off.
[24:29] Second verse. Then they all left off
[24:32] from the base camp down the bottom and
[24:35] made a home way up at South Cole. Bore,
[24:38] Dylan, and Evans tried to make it to the
[24:40] summit, but the summit said, "No, no,
[24:42] no."
[24:45] Then
[24:47] then Mr. Hunt called Ed and Kenzing and
[24:50] said, "You boys can go for a shot." So
[24:52] they packed their bags and the oxygen
[24:54] tanks and started pushing their way to
[24:57] the top.
[24:58] And they pushed on up through the snow
[25:00] and the rocks and the ice and the
[25:01] lifeless air till it looked like they
[25:04] couldn't go on. Tenzing said, "Should we
[25:05] turn back, Ed?"
[25:07] But Ed said, "I I didn't come this far
[25:09] to give up now. I can see the
[25:12] mountaintop and I won't stop until I
[25:14] knock it. Knock it knock it off.
[25:18] Cuz if you knew what I've been through
[25:19] to get here, blood, sweat, and tears,
[25:22] you would see why I can't just walk
[25:24] away. You would see why I can't just
[25:26] walk away. If you knew what I've been
[25:28] through to get here, blood, sweat, and
[25:30] tears, you would see why I can't just
[25:33] walk away. You would see why I can't
[25:34] just walk away. Cuz I didn't come this
[25:37] far to give up now. I can see the
[25:39] mountaintop. And I won't stop until I
[25:41] knock it. Knock it. Knock it. And then
[25:44] at the end of the song, as every good
[25:46] song has to have a climax, the end of
[25:47] the song is Ed singing, "I'm standing on
[25:50] the top of the world."
[25:54] So that's the prophetic song.
[25:58] So I'm at the So I'm driving the other
[26:01] day. I drive to the dump to drop all
[26:03] this rubbish at the dump. And I
[26:07] I reverse my trailer with all this
[26:09] rubbish on to this almost the Gizbborne
[26:11] dump. Brother Ben, it's you can still
[26:13] see the rubbish. It's all there. You can
[26:14] sort of like smell it, you know,
[26:17] nostalgia.
[26:19] Brother Ben talked about the old
[26:20] Gizbborne dump the other day, which was
[26:22] just a pile of rubbish by the beach.
[26:24] Just a mound of rubbish.
[26:28] So, so I reverse up and I get my trailer
[26:31] back to where you chuck the rubbish in.
[26:35] And I walked hop out of my car and walk
[26:38] down the side and I see this old crusty
[26:39] can on the ground. And I'm about to I
[26:42] think I'm going to boot that old can in
[26:43] the rubbish
[26:45] um dump. And somebody said, "No,
[26:49] don't boot the cannon. Keep the can."
[26:52] I thought, "No, the crusty old can. It's
[26:54] just going to probably be all dirty. I'm
[26:56] just going to boot it in." But I just
[26:58] picked it up, had a look at it. Looked
[27:00] like a pretty old can. I do like old
[27:02] cans cuz I made old films and I had like
[27:04] collected old like tin cans from 1900
[27:06] and that. So, I liked old cans, but this
[27:08] one didn't look really that old. It was
[27:10] kind of rusty. I thought I would chuck
[27:11] it. So, I chucked it down. I was going
[27:13] to boot it in again. But you know the
[27:15] second time somebody said keep take that
[27:17] can home clean it up and never get rid
[27:18] of it. Never get rid of that can like
[27:21] quite a strong feeling. I thought man I
[27:23] better what on earth is this said can
[27:25] you know?
[27:28] So I pick up the can and I look at the
[27:30] front of it and it says that on the
[27:32] front
[27:34] Romney's Kendall Mint Cake.
[27:36] I thought what on earth is Romney
[27:38] Romney's Kendall Mint Cake?
[27:42] So I read on the back
[27:47] and it says Romney's Kendall Mint Cake
[27:50] was the first mint cake to be
[27:52] successfully carried to the top of Mount
[27:53] Everest on 29th of May 1953.
[27:56] This being the first successful
[27:58] expedition to the summit. Romney were
[28:00] approached by the 1953 expedition to
[28:02] Everest to see whether they could supply
[28:05] mint cake to them within seven days.
[28:07] This had to be packed into high altitude
[28:10] packs for inclusion to this um in the
[28:12] supplies to be sent ahead. Hence the
[28:14] need for haste. Fortunately, they had
[28:17] sufficient stock to meet their need and
[28:19] the staff willingly gave up their sweet
[28:21] ration coupons to comply with the law.
[28:23] Sir Edmund Hillary and Sudor Suda
[28:26] Tenzing ate this mint cake on top of
[28:28] Mount Everest as they gazed at the
[28:30] countryside below them. Since then,
[28:34] Kendall Mint Cake has been a firm
[28:36] favorite with hikers, climbers, and
[28:37] visitors to the Lakes District.
[28:40] So then I realize why I'm keeping hold
[28:42] of this little this little tin.
[28:50] I got a few more minutes.
[28:56] Now,
[28:58] people often ask me, "How's the film
[28:59] going? How's the film going?" And I say,
[29:00] "Yeah, it's going. I'm doing stuff, but
[29:03] I really haven't started the film.
[29:06] But like like Edund Hillary, I think he
[29:09] climbed a few other mountains before he
[29:10] climbed Mount Everest, you know? So I
[29:13] said, "Look, I'm doing stuff. I'm just
[29:14] not doing the film because I'm just
[29:16] climbing this one, climbing that one,
[29:17] learning this, learning that." But I
[29:19] hadn't actually officially, it's been 14
[29:21] years, I haven't actually officially
[29:22] started it yet.
[29:25] But the funny thing with this was when
[29:27] they got the supplies, they were at base
[29:29] camp. And when they got the supplies and
[29:30] they started their walk up to the top of
[29:32] the hill, they had to wait till they got
[29:34] the supplies. And call me crazy, but the
[29:37] Lord said, "Now you got to start making
[29:38] the film." Like you you got the supplies
[29:40] now. You go you can officially start and
[29:42] go and ascent do your ascent up to
[29:45] uh the top of the hill.
[29:51] So I kind of like that. And I and I kind
[29:55] of got asked how long I wanted. I said
[29:58] three, but now I said three and a half.
[29:59] I want three and a half years to to do
[30:01] it. If you give me from now, give me
[30:02] three and a half years and I'll do it.
[30:05] And so then the date was the 14th to the
[30:09] 7th. So three and a half years will be
[30:12] the 14th day of the first month.
[30:15] If you are Jewish, that would be the
[30:16] Passover.
[30:18] But we're not Jewish. We are Western. So
[30:21] that's 14th of January. But the 14th or
[30:22] the first is Passover.
[30:26] Now,
[30:28] so I wrote the date on the inside of the
[30:30] can.
[30:32] The start date. I wrote the finished
[30:33] date on the inside of the can. I'm going
[30:34] to hold on to this can that's sitting at
[30:36] home along with my bird's nest. If you
[30:38] remember the bird's nest, still got the
[30:40] bird's nest. The law seems to do these
[30:42] things like this. Now, there's going to
[30:44] be two outcomes in this whole thing.
[30:47] The one outcome would be I get to the
[30:50] top which would be reasonably satisfying
[30:54] because then I can push stop
[30:59] please.
[31:01] Another outcome is I die on the hill.
[31:04] But I think about it and I'm like that's
[31:05] not a bad hill to die on.
[31:10] Now the reason why I want to come up and
[31:11] say this publicly is because it makes it
[31:14] official if I do this. I kind of in a
[31:16] way I hold myself to it as well rather
[31:18] than it just be sitting somewhere and
[31:19] the devil can mess with them. I'm like,
[31:20] "No, actually set it back there and I'm
[31:21] going to do it." But I I wait till I get
[31:25] these things anyway before I move
[31:26] forward with stuff.
[31:29] But the I guess the only problem is is
[31:31] that Satan is I mean, he already hates
[31:34] you. He hates me.
[31:37] And he's been at me for years to try and
[31:39] destroy me. And this is only going to
[31:41] make him a bit more
[31:45] Yeah. And probably all hell is going to
[31:47] be against me, against you guys. But
[31:51] that's all right. If God be for us, who
[31:52] can be against us?
[31:54] &gt;&gt; We s we we're stronger than he is.
[31:58] And then I thought about it cuz I
[31:59] thought this this almost seems crazy to
[32:01] start it now. But so I've been through
[32:03] through so much stuff in the last two
[32:04] and a half years. Like Satan's thrown
[32:05] everything he can at me to derail me and
[32:07] to just ruin my whole life. But I stand
[32:10] up here today and I think, you know
[32:12] what? I'm still here.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; I'm still standing. And is that all you
[32:18] got? You know, and I thought back and I
[32:20] think, you know, it's it's actually you
[32:22] deal with the stuff every single day
[32:24] that I have for years. You actually get
[32:26] stronger. I thought I'm stronger than
[32:27] what I ever have been. The scheme to
[32:29] ruin us actually makes us stronger.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; And you know,
[32:35] we just become mighty warriors because
[32:37] we just get so used to fighting that's
[32:39] all we know. We just get up, we fight,
[32:40] we move forward.
[32:43] And
[32:45] I've also got a bit of uh righteous
[32:48] anger built up in me. And I feel like
[32:51] it's the day of vengeance, too.
[32:54] It's a day of vengeance.
[32:59] So, at the premiere, mark my words, at
[33:02] the premiere, you're going to get a
[33:04] little pack. And in that pack is going
[33:06] to be one of these Kendall's mint cakes
[33:09] in the
[33:11] in the premier pack. So, you're going
[33:13] to, if you all are going to be there,
[33:16] you're going to be sitting on the chair
[33:17] eating some Kendall's mint cake while
[33:20] you're watching the film. Okay,
[33:23] mark my words.
[33:26] So, yeah, that's what I wanted to share
[33:29] with you this morning. Thanks for the
[33:32] time to just share. I really appreciate
[33:34] really appreciate it.
[33:41] Can we just stand? I've taken up the
[33:42] time, but let's just sing. Um, why I
[33:44] won't be shaken. I won't be moved before
[33:46] I ask brother Ben to come up.
[33:50] I speak to the mountain.
[33:53] It's time to move.
[33:56] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[33:58] greater than you.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:18] Why would I worry when giants come
[34:22] calling my name?
[34:27] Cuz my God is so much bigger than
[34:31] troubles I face.
[34:34] [Music]
[34:37] Why would I hunger for power or riches
[34:41] or fame?
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] Cuz my God is so much better than all of
[34:50] these things.
[34:54] I won't be shen.
[34:58] I won't be moved.
[35:03] My God is faithful.
[35:07] His promise is true.
[35:12] I speak to the mountain.
[35:17] It's time to move.
[35:21] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[35:26] greater than you.
[35:31] My enemies scatter. They know the battle
[35:36] is done.
[35:41] My God is stronger. The victory already
[35:46] won.
[35:48] [Music]
[35:50] He died for my ransom, rose up on the
[35:54] third day.
[35:58] [Music]
[35:59] My God is greater than death. Hell in
[36:03] the grave. I won't be shen. I won't be
[36:08] shen.
[36:12] I won't be.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:17] My God is faithful.
[36:21] His promise is true.
[36:25] So I speak to the mountain.
[36:30] Oh, it's time to
[36:35] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[36:40] greater than. Oh, I won't be shaking. I
[36:45] won't be shen.
[36:49] I won't be.
[36:54] My God is faithful.
[36:58] His promise is true.
[37:02] So I speak to the mountain.
[37:07] Oh, it's time to move.
[37:12] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[37:17] greater than you.
[37:20] There's no mountain.
[37:23] There's no mountain to hide. No valley
[37:26] to know. There's no fear that I have. He
[37:30] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[37:33] to bring. There's no weapon to show.
[37:36] There is nothing for God that's
[37:39] impossible.
[37:41] There's no mountain to high, no belly to
[37:45] low. There's no fear that I have. He
[37:48] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[37:52] to me. There's no weapon to smoke. There
[37:55] is nothing for God that's impossible.
[38:01] [Music]
[38:02] So I won't be shen.
[38:07] I won't be
[38:12] my God is faithful.
[38:16] His promise is true.
[38:19] I speak I speak to the mountain.
[38:24] [Music]
[38:30] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[38:35] greater than you. Oh, I won't be
[38:38] shaking. I won't be shen.
[38:44] I won't be moved.
[38:48] My God is faithful.
[38:53] His promise is true.
[38:56] [Music]
[38:58] So I speak to the mountain.
[39:03] It's time to move.
[39:06] [Music]
[39:08] &gt;&gt; My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[39:13] greater than you.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve the all powerful,
[39:19] almighty, mighty conqueror himself. And
[39:22] we face a defeated foe. Hallelujah.
[39:25] Amen. God bless you all. Praise the
[39:28] Lord. Thank you, musicians. Amen.
[39:29] Thanks, brother Isaac. Climb your
[39:30] mountain, my brother. Just climb it.
[39:32] That summit's yours. Climb it. Amen.
[39:35] Praise God. Well, we got a birthday girl
[39:37] here. Happy birthday, Lilia.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God bless you.
[39:44] Praise the Lord. Amen. Some you'll be
[39:47] celebrating afterwards. Amen. Um, so
[39:50] sadly this is the Sturwig's last service
[39:53] together as a family. I'm
[39:58] basically yes uh sadly. So yes, a
[40:01] brother Amanda after the minister's
[40:02] meeting this coming weekend is going to
[40:04] go up north. So they're moving to
[40:05] Fungare, I'm sure you're aware. So we're
[40:08] not happy about this at all, but the
[40:10] Lord's will be done. So we're going to
[40:12] miss you terribly. We'll pray for you at
[40:13] the end of the service, okay? But just
[40:15] um sorry to put a dampener on everyone's
[40:17] day, but you know, anyway, let's go to
[40:20] the scripture, shall we? uh today let's
[40:22] go to we're going to go to Joel chapter
[40:24] 3
[40:27] and I want to speak about yeah so Joel 3
[40:29] and 11-14 so
[40:32] um
[40:34] yes as you can see Christine's not here
[40:35] today Lord willing another time okay so
[40:39] I thank you for your prayers really
[40:41] appreciate it your love and support it's
[40:43] really phenomenal so we're going to talk
[40:46] here
[40:49] if we have so Joel 3 and heaven.
[40:54] I think this ties in very nicely with
[40:57] brother with what brother Jimmy was
[40:58] speaking on on Wednesday.
[41:01] So he says here, "Now assemble
[41:03] yourselves and come all ye heathen and
[41:05] gather yourselves together round about.
[41:07] Hither cause thy mighty ones to come
[41:10] down, O Lord. Let the heathen be
[41:12] wakened. Come up to the valley of
[41:14] Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to
[41:16] judge all the heathen roundabout. Put
[41:18] you in the sickle, for the harvest is
[41:20] ripe. Come, get you down. For the press
[41:23] is full, the vats overflow, for their
[41:24] wickedness is great. Multitudes,
[41:27] multitudes in the valley of decision.
[41:30] For the day of the Lord is near in the
[41:32] valley of decision.
[41:35] So I want to talk about the valley of
[41:36] decision as the power of decision or
[41:38] indecision. Now when I talk about this,
[41:41] I'm not just talking to people who have
[41:42] not made a decision. This this is for
[41:44] all of us, okay? because there's a
[41:47] journey that we're taking. So, I pray
[41:49] this is very personal. I pray God speaks
[41:51] to all of our hearts, including mine. I
[41:54] pray the Lord has his way today.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, let's bow our heads and let's
[41:57] just commit our lives to the Lord. Amen.
[42:00] Gracious, loving father, how thankful we
[42:02] are, Lord. You are the same yesterday,
[42:04] today, and forever. We praise your great
[42:06] name for this day. We can gather as a
[42:08] people once again, Lord. We don't take
[42:10] for granted that we can be here as a
[42:11] body of believers praising and
[42:13] worshiping you. Dear God, as we've read
[42:16] your great eternal word, Lord, we I
[42:17] invite you, the great author of the
[42:19] book, Lord, now step forth. May you
[42:21] speak, Lord. May you listen through
[42:23] everyone who's hearing, dear God. So
[42:25] don't just anoint me to speak, Lord. I
[42:27] pray you'd anoint everyone to hear. Not
[42:29] just hear those who are streaming, dear
[42:30] God. Father, may you. We just want to
[42:33] plead your blood over our lives. Take
[42:35] control of the service. Guard my tongue,
[42:37] dear God. Have your way among us. We
[42:39] love you with all our hearts. We thank
[42:40] you for this day. Be those who couldn't
[42:42] be here today, Lord. We always mindful
[42:44] when someone's not here. Dear God,
[42:46] especially Lord, my darling Lord who's
[42:48] who's recovering, thank you for your
[42:49] healing hand upon her. And anyone else
[42:51] who couldn't be here because of sickness
[42:52] or travel, Lord, wherever they may be,
[42:54] be their abundant portion in Jesus
[42:56] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[42:58] you. Friends, you can have your seats
[43:00] this morning. So, I want to speak about
[43:03] being in the valley of decision. Now, I
[43:06] want to just break this down a little
[43:09] bit because
[43:10] there's uh oh, wait, let's put the
[43:13] scripture back up because I used to
[43:15] think this scripture said that the Lord
[43:16] is near in the valley of decision. Like
[43:18] he's there in the valley to help you
[43:20] make your decision. But this scripture
[43:22] actually is far more has far more
[43:24] gravity than that. Because as we read
[43:26] here, this scripture speaks of today
[43:29] because the day of the Lord, this is not
[43:32] the day of the Lord. I'm just going to
[43:33] break this down and we're going to go a
[43:34] bit of a journey. Okay. So, let's just
[43:37] put the first bit. So, so put in ye the
[43:39] sickle for the harvest is ripe. This is
[43:41] the harvest time. I mean, this is the
[43:43] harvest age where the tears are being
[43:46] gathered and to be burned and the
[43:47] wheat's been gathered to the garner.
[43:49] This is the harvest age. This is harvest
[43:51] season where every seed is coming to its
[43:53] manifestation. Whether you're a wheat or
[43:55] you're a tear, whatever you are, it's
[43:57] going to come out what's in you. And I
[43:59] just want to say from the very
[44:00] beginning, I believe we're all wheat
[44:02] this morning. I don't believe that
[44:03] there's any tears here. Okay.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; I just believe all wheat.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. So, but this is the harvest
[44:10] season. This is a gathering time. Israel
[44:12] has been gathered that 144,000 will be
[44:14] harvested. Amen. The bride has been
[44:16] gathered to the word that there will be
[44:18] a harvest. And the world council of
[44:19] churches has been gathered not for a
[44:22] harvest for a burning. Amen. So, this is
[44:24] but this is a time when there's, you
[44:26] know, and and then also this time is a
[44:28] time where their wickedness is great.
[44:30] Whether has there been such a time as as
[44:32] since the days of Noah where the
[44:34] thoughts of man are evil continually.
[44:36] The imagination of man is either on some
[44:38] woman or some drink or some pleasure or
[44:40] something wicked. You know, there's no
[44:42] sound mind really. Very, very few people
[44:44] have a sound mind out in the world or
[44:46] even, you know, and it wants to come in
[44:48] among us and and pollute our minds. But
[44:50] I say the Holy Ghost is here to keep our
[44:52] minds clean. Amen. We can take that
[44:54] double barrel shotgun like I was talking
[44:55] about last Sunday and blast those things
[44:57] out in the name of Jesus Christ. So the
[44:59] wickedness is great even as Abraham was
[45:02] told by God that you know that the
[45:04] iniquity of the Amalachites had to wax
[45:06] full before Israel would come out of
[45:08] Egypt and go into the promised land. And
[45:10] you know I believe this is this is the
[45:12] season that we live in. But while this
[45:14] is all going on there's multitudes
[45:16] multitudes in the valley of decision.
[45:18] There's because this is a day where
[45:20] every idea under the sun can be given
[45:23] can be sent to you. You can access any
[45:26] idea under the sun. And so there's
[45:28] multitudes in the valley of decision.
[45:30] And even among believers, there's a
[45:32] multitude in the valley of decision
[45:33] where there's a now this may be a bit
[45:35] heavy today, but let's just take it
[45:36] personal. This is I just want to get
[45:37] this off my heart. Then I can just be
[45:39] happy and walk out of here, okay? So
[45:41] let's just don't don't put up a shield,
[45:43] okay? Because the last thing we want to
[45:45] do is be left behind. Okay? We don't
[45:48] want to come and where's everyone gone?
[45:50] What's happened? and the raptures
[45:51] happened and we've and we've been around
[45:52] the truth and been around rapturing
[45:54] faith and around the presence of God and
[45:56] yet we just been feeding off the
[45:58] blessings of it and not becoming one
[46:00] with him. He doesn't want you just to
[46:02] feed off the blessings. He wants you to
[46:03] become one with him more than anything.
[46:05] I mean that's why he sent this message
[46:07] is that you and Christ would become one.
[46:09] Amen. This is what he's wanted. That's
[46:10] why he died for you. Amen. That you and
[46:12] him would become one. So there's a
[46:13] there's a multitude in the valley of
[46:15] decision. They can't make up their mind.
[46:17] Amen. And it says for the day of the
[46:19] Lord is near in the valley of decision.
[46:22] So when there's a time there's a
[46:23] multitude of people in the valley of
[46:24] decision, the day of the Lord is very
[46:26] close. Now the day we live in today is
[46:29] not the day of the Lord. This is man's
[46:31] day, man's ideas, man's religion, man's
[46:35] opinion. He says this in the Patmos
[46:37] vision. He says, "Now let's get back to
[46:38] our scripture. We know what the Lord's
[46:40] day is not. It's not Saturday or Sunday.
[46:43] It's not keeping a day. We know that,
[46:45] right? The reason we gather on a Sunday
[46:47] morning is to honor the resurrection.
[46:48] But you, we could have church any day we
[46:50] wanted.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; It's not about, oh, you got to keep a
[46:52] day. No, the true day of rest is the
[46:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[46:56] true Sabbath. We know that, right? So,
[46:58] it's not keeping a day. Well, what is it
[46:59] then? Today is certainly not the Lord's
[47:01] day. This is man's day. This is man's
[47:03] doing, man's work, man's church, man's
[47:05] idea of worship, man's everything. For
[47:07] it's man's world, cosmos. But the day of
[47:10] the Lord is coming. Yes, it is. It is
[47:13] just like that at this time.
[47:15] of the revelation of Jesus Christ. John
[47:17] was taken up by the spirit and
[47:18] transported by the spirit to the great
[47:20] day that is coming. The Lord's day is
[47:22] when the days of men are over. The
[47:24] kingdoms of this world will then become
[47:26] the kingdoms of our God. The day of the
[47:28] Lord is when the judgments fall. And
[47:30] after that comes the millennium. So that
[47:32] so so this day of the Lord is the great
[47:34] and dreadful day of the Lord, which is
[47:36] the great tribulation time where
[47:38] salvation's done. Mercy's gone back to
[47:41] the Jews. If you're holy, you're holy
[47:43] still. filthy, filthy, still righteous,
[47:44] righteous still. Your the Gentiles are
[47:47] locked in their position and God turns
[47:49] back to the Jews and they have a day of
[47:51] grace of well a season of grace of three
[47:54] and a half years where God turns back to
[47:56] them. So that is that that happens in
[47:58] the day of the Lord. So this is this is
[48:00] near in the valley of decision. So we're
[48:03] living in this day.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Can we all agree together?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just trust you can see this
[48:08] here. It's more than a vague idea. No,
[48:10] Joel is looking at you and I and the
[48:13] world in 2025 where there's a great
[48:15] valley of decision that that multitudes
[48:17] are in.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, right now the world does
[48:21] what it wants to do with the Christian.
[48:23] They call them all manner of evil names
[48:25] making fun of him. But there is coming
[48:26] that great and notable day when they
[48:28] will wail in hell for the lamb is coming
[48:30] in wrath to judge the world. That is
[48:32] when the righteous will have their day
[48:34] with the Lord. For the wicked shall burn
[48:35] and the righteous will walk over their
[48:37] ashes into the millennium. Malachi 4:3.
[48:39] And they shall tread down the wicked,
[48:40] and they shall be ashes under the souls
[48:42] of their feet in the day that I shall do
[48:44] this, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. Now, I
[48:46] don't say that or quote that with any
[48:48] satisfaction.
[48:49] I don't want to be treading on anyone's
[48:51] ashes, right? In the world, anyone. I
[48:54] want everyone to get there,
[48:56] &gt;&gt; right? But you've got to make a choice,
[48:58] right? You can't just float along and be
[49:00] around. It's like helping Noah build the
[49:02] ark, but you don't get in the ark.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Because the problem is people don't make
[49:06] up their mind. is because they think the
[49:08] devil's offer is good as the the Lord's
[49:10] offer. It's like if you've ever had two
[49:12] job offers at the same time and it takes
[49:14] you a while to actually pick one. It's
[49:16] you're standing in the valley of
[49:17] decision. You can't actually work out
[49:19] which one's right. You think, "Oh, this
[49:20] one's got merit, but this one's got this
[49:22] kind of merit." And maybe if I just, you
[49:24] know, pick this one, but then this one,
[49:26] what you doing? You're in the valley of
[49:27] decision. And the, you know, the devil
[49:29] always tries to come to us and say,
[49:32] just, you know, you don't need to really
[49:33] give your heart to the Lord. You don't
[49:35] really need the Holy Ghost. You don't
[49:36] really you just need to be part of the
[49:38] group and you know cuz the group's going
[49:39] and you know I heard something
[49:40] ridiculous the other day.
[49:43] I heard no one here said it but but some
[49:45] people believe that going to church
[49:46] makes you a Christian.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Like going to church makes you rapture
[49:50] ready. Like just being part of a group.
[49:52] I think it was Billy Graham made the
[49:54] saying very famous. He said, you know,
[49:56] coming to church doesn't make you any
[49:58] more a Christian than standing in a
[50:00] garage makes you a car.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; You can live in a garage. You'll never
[50:04] become a car. I'm sorry. You never
[50:06] become a car. It doesn't matter what car
[50:07] you want. Oh, I identify as a Ferrari.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really going to help you.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; But that's the thing. People think, "No,
[50:16] well, I'm just part of the group and I'm
[50:17] part of the group and well, the group's
[50:19] going to go and I see God live and I see
[50:21] him do miracles and God changes lives in
[50:23] front of me and all these things." But
[50:24] you can't just be part of the group.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Being part of the group does not save
[50:28] you. It's a personal walk with the Lord
[50:30] himself. Amen. When you get filled with
[50:32] the Holy Ghost, you make a because
[50:33] you've got to make a decision. And you
[50:35] know there's one thing that God will
[50:36] never tamper with, which is your free
[50:38] will.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; He will never force himself upon anyone.
[50:41] He never makes you makes you surrender.
[50:43] He never makes you give your life. It's
[50:45] a it's a gift
[50:47] &gt;&gt; that you must receive
[50:48] &gt;&gt; and it's your decision and he will
[50:50] respect your decision.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Either way,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; there's consequences either way.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; On one hand, there's a great tribulation
[50:58] and the white throne judgment. On the
[51:00] other hand, there's a rapture and a
[51:02] wedding supper and walking on streets of
[51:04] gold and walking in this life knowing
[51:06] there's no condemnation because you're
[51:07] walking after the Lord and you're sealed
[51:09] to the day of your redemption. You're
[51:11] safe as safe can be. So, which one do
[51:13] you want?
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I would I want the rapture side,
[51:18] &gt;&gt; right? I want the rapture side. But you
[51:20] see, there's always a pressure now.
[51:21] Well, the group, you know, and and the
[51:23] problem is, you know, the church could
[51:24] hold us back.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Because you think, well, everyone else
[51:28] is doing certain things, so I'll just
[51:30] match up with what everyone else is
[51:31] doing, and therefore I'm fine.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; That is a false culture.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That's a false message culture. Amen. We
[51:40] must never ever let a lady sin message
[51:43] culture come around where we're just
[51:45] part of the church and we, you know, we
[51:46] we need to be part of a group. The Bible
[51:49] says, "Do not forsake the assembling of
[51:51] yourselves together, especially when you
[51:53] see the time approaching, right? So, we
[51:54] must be part of a body." Good luck going
[51:56] to try and live by yourself and be an
[51:58] overcomer. You will fizzle out. People
[52:00] have done it. People have tried. It's
[52:02] just the devil's lies getting somewhere
[52:03] away and they refuse to be part of a
[52:05] body. We must be part of a body. And I'm
[52:07] not saying that because I'm a pastor.
[52:08] I'm saying that because I'm a Christian.
[52:10] I mean, if I wasn't standing here, I'd
[52:12] be there. Amen. If I wasn't there, I'd
[52:13] be helping somewhere being part of a
[52:15] body. Why? Because the body of Christ,
[52:18] there's something in a believer that
[52:19] wants fellowship. It yearns to be part
[52:21] of a body cuz God doesn't want us
[52:23] separate. He wants us united. Doesn't
[52:24] matter what church we go to, be part of
[52:26] a body.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, now people want to
[52:30] be. But the thing is, people are in this
[52:32] valley of decision. And they and they
[52:34] and they wonder, well, you know, do I
[52:36] really need to? I say, you must
[52:38] &gt;&gt; give your life to Christ.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I need something to happen. Well, it's
[52:42] happening this morning.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. The word of God is here to
[52:46] actually say make up your mind because
[52:48] the devil wants to hold you in this in
[52:50] this in this holding pattern. It's like
[52:53] being a it's like being in an airplane,
[52:54] you know, like a holding Who's ever been
[52:56] in a holding pattern in a plane because
[52:57] there's a queue that, you know, going to
[52:59] the runway and you circle and you
[53:02] circle. Now, you're not worried because
[53:03] you know that the aircraft has got
[53:05] enough fuel. But what if the airplane
[53:08] circles forever? It's not going to stay
[53:10] up there forever. It's going to crash,
[53:12] right? So why hold in a holding pattern
[53:15] when you can land into safety? You can
[53:19] enjoy the goodness of God. You can have
[53:21] your own revival. Amen. You can have the
[53:23] power of God living in your life and
[53:25] you're not just part of the groupy. I
[53:27] tell you what, friends, the church never
[53:28] saved saved nobody.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; This church has never saved a single
[53:32] soul. The word of God coming to a open
[53:34] heart saves. Amen. It redeems. It's not
[53:37] the church that saves.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will never get salvation
[53:41] through Shikina Tabernacle. You get
[53:43] salvation through the word of God. Amen.
[53:45] If the word of God is preached,
[53:46] salvation will come. Deliverance will
[53:48] come. Healing will come. Restoration
[53:50] will come. Why? Cuz it's the word's God
[53:52] to do it. Amen. It's it's the word's job
[53:55] to do it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see what happens is is
[53:59] being in the valley of decision makes
[54:01] you unstable. As it says here, but let
[54:03] him ask in faith, never wavering. For he
[54:06] that waverth is like a sea um of the I
[54:08] mean wave of the sea driven like uh with
[54:10] the wind and tossed. Let not that man
[54:13] think that he shall receive sorry for
[54:15] let not that man think that he shall
[54:18] receive anything of the Lord. A
[54:20] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[54:23] ways. So someone in the valley of
[54:25] decision is unstable in all their ways.
[54:28] And I'm going to come to it. It's not
[54:29] just those who haven't even given their
[54:30] lives and been baptized. It's those on
[54:33] the journey
[54:34] &gt;&gt; can be very unstable because they
[54:35] haven't actually made up their mind.
[54:36] They've just gone with the mess and
[54:38] while everyone else is doing it and well
[54:40] my friends and this is no, it's got to
[54:42] be an individual decision.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I'll just drop this in right
[54:46] now. If the if if I cease to be if every
[54:50] preacher or lay minister here ceased to
[54:53] be and the deacons and the tech and the
[54:55] musicians, what would you do?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Would you just just just just just drift
[54:59] back into the world somewhere? Or would
[55:02] you say no? We need to gather.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; We need to have a place where God comes
[55:05] down and meets our needs, Lord. And and
[55:08] would you pray in such a way till God
[55:09] comes down and speaks like he did in the
[55:11] book of Acts and said, "Sparans to be um
[55:13] Paul and Barnabas for the work
[55:15] &gt;&gt; that they must do."
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that that the officers would
[55:19] be replaced by another gift or would you
[55:21] just just float?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; What's holding you?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; If you haven't made up your decision, I
[55:27] say a church is holding you. But if you
[55:30] have, it's God.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what happens,
[55:34] you'll be a solid soldout Christian all
[55:36] the days of your life. But if you're
[55:38] just going because I've seen churches
[55:40] fall apart in the past and all the
[55:42] believers leave because the pastor
[55:43] stands up and says he's an atheist. Now,
[55:47] &gt;&gt; what was holding those people?
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Obviously, it wasn't the word. It wasn't
[55:51] Christ. It was maybe the pastor's care
[55:53] and love and personality.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be kept. I trust you're
[55:57] not kept because of me. Yes,
[55:59] &gt;&gt; I would have I'd be the biggest failure
[56:02] in I would die on a bad hill
[56:04] &gt;&gt; if it was me keeping a people.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Humanity will disappoint you.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; If your if your faith is in me, you've
[56:13] really placed your faith in the wrong
[56:14] thing. But if your faith is in the word,
[56:16] then you'll know that God will use a
[56:18] gift to help your life. Right? But so if
[56:20] your faith is just in man, that man will
[56:22] disappoint you.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Right? We understand. I trust this is
[56:25] all coming out. Okay? Amen. If someone
[56:27] in the valley of decision is unstable in
[56:29] all their ways. If someone is sold out,
[56:32] they're stable in all their ways. Right?
[56:34] You you'll still have trouble. You'll
[56:36] still have mind battles. You'll still go
[56:38] through many different things. But
[56:39] there's an anchor. There's a rock that
[56:40] you're built upon that you cannot be
[56:42] moved off. Doesn't matter how much the
[56:44] wind blows. Doesn't matter how much
[56:46] floods come. Doesn't matter whatever
[56:47] happens. Like the Lord says, he that
[56:49] builds their house upon the rock. Amen.
[56:52] He's a wise man. He digs down through
[56:54] culture, through human upbringing,
[56:57] through just well, this is how we've
[56:58] always done it. They dug dig through
[57:00] that sand. Amen. Till they hit the rock
[57:02] of revelation. Then they build their
[57:04] life upon that and they're satisfied.
[57:06] And storms come and they go, but their
[57:08] house is still standing. But those who
[57:11] build their house on the moving sands of
[57:13] man's idea, and well, I come to church
[57:15] cuz mom and dad take me to church and I
[57:16] believe this cuz mom and dad believe
[57:18] this and we do this cuz the church does
[57:19] this. That's sand.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; That won't hold you. All those things
[57:23] may be perfectly correct and right, but
[57:25] if it's just if it's just culture or
[57:27] upbringing, then it's just sand. But if
[57:29] you really dig down and say, "I want to
[57:31] know for myself. I want to know Jesus
[57:33] Christ for myself. I'm not I'm not
[57:35] satisfied with a secondhanded decision
[57:37] or a secondhand opinion or just cuz mom
[57:40] and dad, I don't care about them no more
[57:42] for a walk. I want to walk with him
[57:44] myself." Amen. That's when a real man
[57:46] stands up. A real a real adult stands up
[57:48] because they're accountable for their
[57:50] own actions and they say, "Lord, I'm
[57:52] going to walk. I want to walk with you.
[57:54] Doesn't matter what my family does.
[57:55] Doesn't matter what everyone else does.
[57:57] I'm walking with you, Lord."
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's it's a it's a thing,
[58:02] you know. It's like Elijah when he was
[58:04] on Mount Carmel, he asked the question,
[58:06] "How long will you hold between two
[58:08] opinions?" Isn't it a strange thing?
[58:11] On one hand they have a statue Baal
[58:16] done nothing for them. It was enforced
[58:19] by the queen. You have to worship this
[58:21] way.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; On the other hand, they had Jehovah of
[58:25] miracles that brought them out of Egypt
[58:28] that part of the Red Sea that brought
[58:29] the plagues that brought the mana that
[58:31] brought the word. Amen. That gave them
[58:34] the cycle of you know revival when
[58:36] judges came and delivered them and
[58:38] incredible miracles happened. That was
[58:40] that was the track record of the Jehovah
[58:42] of miracles.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; The other guy, he's just a dumb statue,
[58:45] a forced religion by a by a queen who's
[58:48] not even an Israelite,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Jezebel, right?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; But why on earth would they be between
[58:54] these two opinions? Which one would you
[58:56] rather have?
[58:59] &gt;&gt; You see, obviously they thought Baal had
[59:01] some kind of merit.
[59:03] What did he do for them?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing. And an idol will give you an
[59:09] unsatisfied, disappointed life.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're following an idol of
[59:14] your heart, you'll never be satisfied
[59:16] with it. Fame, beauty, wealth, power,
[59:19] prestige, job, whatever it is,
[59:21] reputation. If you're trying to, if that
[59:23] thing is your thing, I've got to have
[59:25] the house and I've got to have the
[59:27] trophy wife and I've got to have this
[59:28] and I've got to have that. That's an
[59:30] idol. and you will fall at its feet with
[59:33] disappointment because not a single idol
[59:35] has ever helped anyone, never aided
[59:38] nobody, never given that satisfying
[59:40] portion like our Lord Jesus does. Amen.
[59:43] But if you follow his word, I tell you
[59:45] what, you'll have trouble, but you will
[59:46] not be disappointed. Amen. He will
[59:48] always come on time. He'll always
[59:50] manifest his word. He'll prove himself
[59:52] in his time. You don't need to. You'll
[59:54] never be dis I've never been
[59:55] disappointed.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've had times when I don't
[59:58] understand what's going on.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Right? I've had times saying, "Lord,
[1:00:02] what are you doing?" But there's I've
[1:00:04] just come to a place in my life say,
[1:00:05] "Lord, you're in control. I'm not
[1:00:07] indifferent. Lord, I'm not become
[1:00:09] detached. My heart is more in you than
[1:00:11] ever. I know you're more than able.
[1:00:12] Lord, I trust you. I've trusted you with
[1:00:14] my life." Amen. For since 2007. And
[1:00:17] Lord, I trust you with my life now more
[1:00:19] than ever. Amen. So, I haven't become,
[1:00:22] you know, indifferent or detached. I
[1:00:23] know he's more than able. So, you know,
[1:00:26] why why not be like that?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my thing and my life and my
[1:00:32] problem and my past and all these
[1:00:33] things. Give it to him.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; We can't sit here
[1:00:40] being doubleminded
[1:00:42] thinking the world has anything to
[1:00:43] offer. Remember, the devil doesn't have
[1:00:44] the keys to his own house. He has no
[1:00:47] eternity to give you. Hell is made for
[1:00:50] the devil and his angels. God made it as
[1:00:52] a place of destruction for them. and
[1:00:54] they're going to go there. They're going
[1:00:55] to burn. They're going to be destroyed.
[1:00:57] But we there's been a place prepared for
[1:00:59] you which is a new Jerusalem.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Which one would you rather have? It's
[1:01:03] really your actions are proving which
[1:01:04] one. If you're in the valley of
[1:01:06] decision, have it up made up your mind.
[1:01:08] You're actually I'm going to say it.
[1:01:09] You're thinking hell's actually has some
[1:01:10] merit.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it flat.
[1:01:15] But if you've made up your mind,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; you've realized actually I just have
[1:01:19] heaven to gain.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got streets of gold to
[1:01:24] dance upon. I've got an eternal body to
[1:01:25] enjoy. I'm going to see my Lord Jesus.
[1:01:28] Amen. I'm going to a place where there's
[1:01:29] no pain, sorrow, fear, death, whatever.
[1:01:32] It's all perfect, sublime, beautiful,
[1:01:34] wonderful. Amen. And because I've made
[1:01:36] up my mind.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but I'm if I'm predestinated,
[1:01:40] I'll get there. If I'm not
[1:01:41] predestinated, I won't. That's unbelief
[1:01:43] talking.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; I am predestinated.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; You got to believe that. I am not
[1:01:49] predestinated to destruction. None of us
[1:01:52] are. We're predestinated to be
[1:01:53] overcomers.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now you say, "Lord, take that
[1:01:57] predestination and manifest it in my
[1:01:59] life." Amen. Cuz the Bible says,
[1:02:01] "Whosoever will, let him come."
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, I've got a willing
[1:02:04] heart. I'm coming, Lord. I'm your
[1:02:05] problem. I'm on your hands, Lord.
[1:02:07] Doesn't matter if you turn me away,
[1:02:08] Lord, I'm going to be your I'm going to
[1:02:10] I'm going to annoy you."
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz I'm on your hands, Lord
[1:02:14] Jesus. I'm not on my own hands. I'm
[1:02:15] certainly not on the devils. I'm on your
[1:02:17] hands, Lord. Amen. He does that. All
[1:02:19] that comes cast out. He said,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah."
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why why why be stuck between
[1:02:25] two opinions? Why just sit there be part
[1:02:27] of the group? Why not stand up and you
[1:02:29] know it's like it's like God would God
[1:02:32] would speak to Job. God's not afraid to
[1:02:34] offend anybody.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's not let's not hurt anyone's
[1:02:37] feelings. No, God says no. He said to
[1:02:39] Job, Job's gone through his big trial.
[1:02:41] His friends have come and accused him.
[1:02:43] He's lost everything but his wife. And
[1:02:44] you know, he's sitting there with boils
[1:02:46] on an ash heap. And you know, God comes
[1:02:48] to him and he just says, "Good up your g
[1:02:50] up now thy loins like a man. I'm going
[1:02:52] to talk to you like a man, Job. I'm not
[1:02:54] talking to you like a jellyfish or some
[1:02:56] pansy. I'm going to talk to you like a
[1:02:57] man. Stand up, Job. I'm going to give
[1:02:59] you an answer. God will always answer
[1:03:02] you." Amen. But he wants you to stand up
[1:03:04] and take it cuz he knows what you're
[1:03:06] made of. He knew Job was a man. He knew
[1:03:07] he's a perfect man. He said, "Now Job,
[1:03:10] I'm going to answer you according to who
[1:03:11] I see you as."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he wasn't like, "Oh, Job, I'm
[1:03:14] so sorry." And here's a count. I'm not
[1:03:16] against counseling, but I just wanted to
[1:03:17] put this out. Yeah, I'm going to give
[1:03:18] you a therapy course and you know, I'm
[1:03:20] going to, you know, I'm going to
[1:03:21] explain. He didn't actually explain it.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; He just told him, "Where were you before
[1:03:25] the foundation of the world? You were
[1:03:27] there, Job, with me. That should settle
[1:03:29] everything, Job."
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Get up your loins like a
[1:03:34] man." Sometimes we need to stop being
[1:03:35] jellyfish
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; and stand up and say, "Hey, where am I
[1:03:39] with God today? How are you with God?
[1:03:41] How's your walk?"
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; What's in here?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Is it culture? message culture. Is it
[1:03:46] mom and dad or is it well I'm, you know,
[1:03:48] my children are fourth generation in
[1:03:51] this message. Praise God for that.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; But they need more than a fourth
[1:03:54] generation experience.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. They need a burning bush
[1:03:57] experience. I don't say they haven't got
[1:03:59] it, but everyone needs that revival.
[1:04:00] Everyone needs that awakening.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where it's a personal walk with
[1:04:04] you and God. Amen. Where you can look on
[1:04:06] the inside of it's not culture build up.
[1:04:08] There's a pillar of fire burning flowing
[1:04:10] out of my soul. Amen. The word put on
[1:04:12] flesh in me.
[1:04:15] And even the Philistines talk like this.
[1:04:17] Be strong and quit yourselves like men.
[1:04:19] This is when they're going to go fight.
[1:04:20] I think it's Saul. You know, oh ye
[1:04:22] Philistines that ye be not servants unto
[1:04:25] the Hebrews as they have been to you.
[1:04:26] Quit yourselves like men and fight. This
[1:04:28] is your enemy talking. He's like, "Come
[1:04:30] on, man. Let's stand up and fight. Let's
[1:04:32] not be jellyfish. No, let's fight this
[1:04:34] thing. We're going to fight to win." You
[1:04:35] know, the devil fights to win.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible with a true
[1:04:39] lenses, he he's going to lose, but he's
[1:04:41] fighting to win. Why do we fight like
[1:04:44] we're going to lose, but we actually
[1:04:45] know we're going to win?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; We should be fighting like we're going
[1:04:47] to win cuz we are winners.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer this morning.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not. And and and God's telling you
[1:04:53] that.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, this message has told you you're
[1:04:55] overcomers. I mean, so why not fight
[1:04:58] like you've won?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Have an assurance in your soul.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be, oh, is it going to what's
[1:05:04] going to happen? No. Don't walk by
[1:05:06] sight. Walk by faith.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you've made a decision,
[1:05:10] you're not walking by sight no more.
[1:05:12] These things lie to me all the time. I
[1:05:13] don't walk by my eyes. I walk by
[1:05:14] revelation. Amen. That God is more than
[1:05:17] able to do it.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if his enemy said, "Quit
[1:05:21] yourselves and be like men and fight,
[1:05:22] why not you and I?"
[1:05:25] Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But you see now what happens is if
[1:05:31] you're between two opinions, it causes
[1:05:34] am and amnesia
[1:05:36] and it gets you to a place where
[1:05:37] actually what you've done, you've lost
[1:05:39] your reasons. You've lost your you've
[1:05:40] lost your mind. You don't know who you
[1:05:42] are. You can't identify yourself. You
[1:05:44] can walk around and eat everything, but
[1:05:47] you still just can't identify yourself.
[1:05:49] So, you can be between two opinions. You
[1:05:51] can have amnesia. Who am I? But you walk
[1:05:54] around, you eat everything.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; You enjoy the blessings. You enjoy the
[1:05:59] atmosphere. You enjoy the fellowship.
[1:06:01] But you're still in the valley of
[1:06:02] decision.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley today.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Make a decision.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you'll be able to
[1:06:09] identify yourself.
[1:06:11] Amen. You have got your scoly education.
[1:06:14] Same education you had, but you don't
[1:06:16] know where it come from. You don't know
[1:06:18] who you are, where you belong. That's
[1:06:19] amnesia. So we are told. What's the
[1:06:22] scoly education I could relate this to?
[1:06:24] Well, I know every quote from 47 to 65.
[1:06:27] But you don't know where it came from.
[1:06:29] It came from Kentucky. It didn't come
[1:06:30] from Kentucky. Didn't come from Jeff
[1:06:32] Jeffersonville. No, it's the revelation
[1:06:34] of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It came from heaven.
[1:06:38] You should realize, no, this this word
[1:06:40] came from heaven. Oh, the apostles wrote
[1:06:42] this and the prophets, this came from
[1:06:44] heaven.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, was, you know, was the King James
[1:06:47] had it translated, the King James Bible,
[1:06:49] whatever version you use, that's fine.
[1:06:50] But, you know, no, God inspired that.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; It brought revival. That's how you know
[1:06:55] God inspired it.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, even this, now
[1:07:02] here's a question.
[1:07:05] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, be
[1:07:07] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:07:08] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
[1:07:10] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,
[1:07:13] and to your children, to all that are
[1:07:14] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[1:07:16] God shall call." That's a decision
[1:07:18] you've got to make. As many as believe,
[1:07:20] the Bible says, "Were baptized." If
[1:07:23] you're a believer, you must get
[1:07:24] baptized.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; It's the next step of your journey. Why
[1:07:27] not take the next step,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; right? You say, "Oh, no, but you know, I
[1:07:31] don't need to do it." Every believer in
[1:07:33] the book of Acts was baptized in the
[1:07:35] name of Jesus Christ. Baptism in the
[1:07:37] name of father, son, holy ghost is not a
[1:07:39] baptism. I know we all know this, but
[1:07:41] Jesus never said in Matthew 28, repeat
[1:07:44] these words when you immerse someone in
[1:07:46] water. I baptize you in the name of the
[1:07:48] father, son, holy ghost. He said,
[1:07:49] baptize them in the name
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; of the father, son, and holy ghost. And
[1:07:53] the name of the father is Jesus.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; I come in my father's name. He said,
[1:07:57] right? What is he? He's the Lord Jesus
[1:07:59] Christ. He said, "Well, a more
[1:08:01] convenient time." The unic said to
[1:08:03] Philillip, "Here's water. What does
[1:08:05] hinder me to be baptized?" Just a few
[1:08:07] minutes in a chariot reading the scrolls
[1:08:09] from Isaiah and opening the word. And he
[1:08:11] realized, "I need to be baptized in the
[1:08:13] name of the Messiah." So, he said,
[1:08:14] "Here's water. What's stopping us?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; There's a whole river out here. There's
[1:08:19] a pool under this pulpit right here.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; What does hinder you?"
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. A better time. I
[1:08:25] need a better environment. No, now is
[1:08:26] the good environment.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Now is the best time. I don't care how
[1:08:30] cold that river is. I'll always get in
[1:08:32] there if you want to get baptized.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; It's a cold grave. But if you want if
[1:08:35] you really want to get baptized, you'll
[1:08:37] get in there.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you know, I haven't made up my
[1:08:39] mind yet. Why not make it up?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're putting pressure on me.
[1:08:43] There'll come a time where you put
[1:08:44] pressure on yourself. I wish I had
[1:08:46] Listen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I wish I had obeyed.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Be too late then.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is mean. No, this is love.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; I want this place to be empty the day of
[1:08:57] the rapture.
[1:08:58] I want well I pray she comes too but the
[1:09:00] lady who you know looks after us when
[1:09:03] we're here you know from this church I
[1:09:04] pray she's messaging saying where are
[1:09:06] you we haven't seen you in so long
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; and there's no one here and they can't
[1:09:09] find anyone they can't contact anyone
[1:09:11] who even is associated with us cuz we're
[1:09:13] all gone
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Oh but you know there's a more
[1:09:17] convenient time. This is a good time.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; This is a very good day.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; If it was bucketing down outside let's
[1:09:24] get in. Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything like that hinder you.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Because if it's the word of God to be
[1:09:31] fulfilled, it's not God stopping you
[1:09:33] fulfill it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; It's really that simple. It's like you
[1:09:36] love your enemy. I can't I can't love
[1:09:38] that guy. What's stopping you love your
[1:09:41] enemy?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; It's not God.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; It's the enemy. It's Satan stopping you
[1:09:46] fulfill the word. See, the devil doesn't
[1:09:48] care how many services you attend. But
[1:09:50] when you become part of the word, that's
[1:09:53] what really bothers him.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the hund, you know, it's
[1:09:56] like the apostles, you know, they were
[1:09:57] with Jesus during his ministry, of
[1:09:59] course, and there's many times in the
[1:10:00] Bible where the Pharisees, the scribes,
[1:10:02] they wanted to stone Jesus, but they
[1:10:05] didn't, but the disciples were there.
[1:10:07] Why weren't they wanting to kill the
[1:10:08] disciples? Because the life of God
[1:10:10] wasn't in them yet. They were just
[1:10:12] associated with the Messiah. But then on
[1:10:15] the day of Pentecost, the same Messiah
[1:10:16] came and dwelt in them. Then they wanted
[1:10:19] to stone them and kill them and threaten
[1:10:20] them and all these things. Why? Cuz the
[1:10:22] life of because they parttook of the
[1:10:23] word.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; They became one with the word. And
[1:10:26] that's why the devil wanted to destroy
[1:10:27] them. So it's not just hanging around is
[1:10:29] not good enough.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; You've got to
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; become one.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, this is not just for these
[1:10:38] people. This is for everyone because I'm
[1:10:39] going to come into some things, right?
[1:10:42] Even even brother Bram said, "The only
[1:10:44] thing that kept me from being saved when
[1:10:45] I was 12 years old because a spirit hung
[1:10:48] over me, a devil saying,"Wait a minute.
[1:10:50] Wait a little longer. That's the reason
[1:10:52] you wasn't saved and you become the age
[1:10:53] of accountability. A spirit you got in a
[1:10:55] crowd that hovered over you, kept
[1:10:57] hanging over you. You wanted to do
[1:10:59] right. There's not a man who's got his
[1:11:01] right mind, but that what wants to do
[1:11:03] right. But there is something won't let
[1:11:05] you do it. Is that right? That's the
[1:11:07] devil. Hallelujah. Christ paid for your
[1:11:09] healing and your salvation.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; So you got to realize that it's if
[1:11:14] whatever is hindering you is not you,
[1:11:16] it's the devil. It's reasoning.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; You got to realize that we say, "Well,
[1:11:22] I'm going to do the opposite to the
[1:11:24] reasoning."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just come down to this now.
[1:11:31] And I'm going to jump around a bit more,
[1:11:32] but here we are. Now, Joshua would come
[1:11:35] to the end of his life. Now we know
[1:11:38] Joshua was with Moses, came out of
[1:11:40] Egypt, came through the Red Sea, came to
[1:11:43] Sinai, went through the desert, took the
[1:11:45] promised land. Now he comes down to the
[1:11:48] end of his life. And he's giving, you
[1:11:50] could say, his last sermon. And he says,
[1:11:52] "Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve
[1:11:54] him in sincerity and in truth and put
[1:11:56] away the gods which your fathers served
[1:11:57] on the other side of the flood and in
[1:11:59] Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it
[1:12:02] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord,
[1:12:04] choose you this day whom you will serve,
[1:12:06] whether it be the gods of your fathers
[1:12:08] served that were on the other side of
[1:12:09] the flood, or the God of the Amorites in
[1:12:11] whose land you dwell. But as for me and
[1:12:13] my house, we will serve the Lord. Now, I
[1:12:17] want you to think about this. Isn't this
[1:12:19] a strange thing for him to say? He's
[1:12:22] been leading the Israelites all these
[1:12:24] years. They've been following the Lord,
[1:12:27] but now he comes to the end and say,
[1:12:29] "Choose, you make a decision." Haven't
[1:12:32] they made their decision?
[1:12:34] The generation that was with Joshua did,
[1:12:37] but the next generation had to make
[1:12:39] their own choice. They had to make their
[1:12:41] decision because
[1:12:44] the the the
[1:12:47] people of Israel, they served the Lord
[1:12:50] all the days of Joshua and all the days
[1:12:52] of the elders that outlived Joshua, who
[1:12:55] had seen the great works of the Lord
[1:12:56] that he did for Israel. And also all
[1:12:58] that generation were gathered into their
[1:13:00] fathers. And there arose another
[1:13:01] generation after them, which knew not
[1:13:04] the Lord, nor yet the works which they
[1:13:07] had um he had done for Israel. And the
[1:13:09] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[1:13:11] of the Lord and served Balam. Isn't this
[1:13:14] a strange thing? These are Israelites
[1:13:16] circumcised sons and daughters of
[1:13:19] Abraham living in the promised land. But
[1:13:22] yet they didn't serve the Lord when
[1:13:25] Joshua and the elders at that generation
[1:13:27] passed off. And I wonder if that same
[1:13:30] thing could happen today where those
[1:13:33] that have a testimony are no longer
[1:13:36] alive in our midst. I'm just going to
[1:13:39] This is We're here today. If you're
[1:13:40] streaming, this is for here. Okay. But I
[1:13:44] want But what happened is the younger
[1:13:45] generation, it degraded to a culture. It
[1:13:49] degraded to an Israelite culture. It
[1:13:51] wasn't God moving in power proving his
[1:13:53] word in their lives anymore. That was
[1:13:55] the older generation. And that human
[1:13:58] leadership held Israel together. The
[1:14:01] testimony of Joshua and the elders kept
[1:14:03] them from serving Balum. And that's
[1:14:06] powerful. But should it not be the
[1:14:08] younger generation now have their own
[1:14:10] revival? Should not they make a decision
[1:14:13] that I'm going beyond the youth group.
[1:14:16] I'm going beyond the church. I'm going
[1:14:18] beyond my parents' expectation and I'm
[1:14:21] going to have my own revival where God
[1:14:23] lives in my life like he did the four
[1:14:25] beers. Amen. where God manifests his
[1:14:27] power. He proves his word. Where you
[1:14:30] where the fire of God falls on my life
[1:14:32] and the word becomes real to me and it
[1:14:34] becomes everything to me.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; You see that? Because brother Johnny
[1:14:41] Deof said at our first camp. I think
[1:14:42] it's 2014. He said a very uh a thing
[1:14:45] that stands quoting to me. He says when
[1:14:48] human leadership is or is it just you
[1:14:50] with a religion because you and a
[1:14:52] religion will end up serving something
[1:14:54] else and you'll wonder why God isn't
[1:14:57] moving in power. Where has he gone? It's
[1:14:59] because you're serving an idol instead
[1:15:00] of serving the Lord.
[1:15:04] But this is not meant to be our portion.
[1:15:07] Even even Israel, let's just
[1:15:11] let's just go to this here.
[1:15:14] The people who came out with Joshua that
[1:15:16] generation
[1:15:18] out of Egypt,
[1:15:20] they followed the group, but they were
[1:15:24] still in the valley of decision all the
[1:15:25] way through the wilderness
[1:15:28] because they came to a point if you look
[1:15:30] at, you know, if you look at the
[1:15:31] wilderness journey, they go from yay to
[1:15:35] ah moments like, "Yay, the Lord's
[1:15:37] delivered us. Praise the Lord. The Red
[1:15:38] Sea's open. Hallelujah." And then
[1:15:40] they're complaining the next minute. And
[1:15:42] then God and then you know they have no
[1:15:44] water and God takes them to water. They
[1:15:46] complain about the water and then
[1:15:48] they're hungry and God sends mana and
[1:15:50] they're yay there's food. Then they
[1:15:52] become dissatisfied with the food. It's
[1:15:54] all very reactionary. People who are in
[1:15:55] the valley of decision just react to
[1:15:58] things. They're always reacting. Yay
[1:16:00] we've got quail. I'm sick of quail. Yay
[1:16:02] we've got mana. I'm sick of mana. Yay
[1:16:04] we're here. I hate being here. I want to
[1:16:06] go back to Egypt. Why? Because they're
[1:16:08] still in the valley of decision. Isn't
[1:16:09] it amazing? They're basically saying,
[1:16:11] you know, I want to go back to Egypt
[1:16:13] where our children are all massacred,
[1:16:15] where we're slaves, where we're not even
[1:16:16] a human, our names don't matter. I want
[1:16:18] to go back to that. That's what they
[1:16:19] were saying.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz they thought being in Egypt had some
[1:16:23] kind of merit.
[1:16:25] They weren't free. They couldn't walk
[1:16:27] with God. All they could do is complain
[1:16:30] about the economic problems.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's that's someone in the valley of
[1:16:34] decision. Who cares if you got money or
[1:16:37] not? That's right.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Our God supplies all our needs.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, things are tight. Praise God.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Things are bountiful. Praise God.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I'm busy. Praise God. I'm not busy.
[1:16:50] Praise God. Don't complain. That's a
[1:16:53] valley of decision mentality. It's all
[1:16:55] reactive. No, but if you make up your
[1:16:57] mind, like Caleb, Caleb and Joshua when
[1:16:59] they went through the land to spy it
[1:17:01] out, they weren't making up their mind.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; They weren't in the valley of decision.
[1:17:05] And the other 10 spies were walking
[1:17:07] through saying, you know, they're
[1:17:08] weighing up all the odds. Yes, this is
[1:17:11] ours, but look at the giants. Yes, this
[1:17:13] is our land, and look what it does, but
[1:17:16] look at the cities. They're weighing up
[1:17:18] in their minds, they had not made a
[1:17:20] clear-cut decision. Though they all had
[1:17:22] been baptized in the Red Sea unto Moses,
[1:17:24] though they had been sanctified in the
[1:17:26] wilderness, so they were they had more
[1:17:27] than just made a decision like a give
[1:17:29] your life to the Lord decision. They
[1:17:30] were walking with God with the pillar of
[1:17:32] fire, but yet they were still they were
[1:17:33] just feeding off the blessings as
[1:17:35] opposed to becoming one with the word
[1:17:37] they meant to fulfill. But Caleb and
[1:17:39] Joshua, they weren't they weren't making
[1:17:41] up their mind. Caleb. Yes, Joshua.
[1:17:44] Tomorrow, we're going to go spy the land
[1:17:46] out.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; It's going to be good.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to see where
[1:17:51] we're going to live.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Hey, Joshua. Yes, Caleb. I believe when
[1:17:55] go when when I see my inheritance, God's
[1:17:57] going to quicken it to me.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I believe with you, Joshua. I mean, I
[1:18:00] believe with you, Caleb. Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] Let's go see what God's given.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought us thus far. We made a
[1:18:07] decision. We're going all the way.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Absolutely, Joshua. It's not even in my
[1:18:11] mind to quit.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We don't quit. We made it made up our
[1:18:14] mind. We're going into the land. It's
[1:18:16] our land. Doesn't matter what obstacles
[1:18:18] are there. We're going in. The other
[1:18:19] spies. I wonder if we can do it. I
[1:18:22] wonder if we can. Do you think their
[1:18:23] cities are that big? Do you think we
[1:18:24] can? you know, yeah, I know he brought
[1:18:26] us out of Egypt, but you know, church is
[1:18:28] a bit hard recently and you know,
[1:18:30] there's trouble and there's things and
[1:18:32] can we really take these promises and
[1:18:34] you know, I heard someone else who went
[1:18:35] to the land and said it's theirs, but
[1:18:37] they just they just came in defeat and
[1:18:38] all these things. And that's someone in
[1:18:40] the valley of decision.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what they did. They came back
[1:18:44] cuz their minds weren't made up. Their
[1:18:45] heart wasn't set on the word. And what
[1:18:48] they do? They came back and they said,
[1:18:49] "Yes, the land is good, but there's
[1:18:50] giants, all these things. We can't take
[1:18:52] it." Why? Cuz they were in the valley of
[1:18:54] decision. Yet they walked with the Lord
[1:18:55] for 40 years.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I pray none of us are in that condition.
[1:19:00] I think I've got everyone's attention
[1:19:01] just now,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; right? As I said, this is for all of us.
[1:19:04] Have we actually made up our mind like
[1:19:06] Caleb? See, because Caleb still the
[1:19:08] people for Moses. Let us go up at once
[1:19:10] and possess it for we are well able to
[1:19:12] overcome it. Amen. That's someone who's
[1:19:14] made up their mind. No, the Lord is on
[1:19:16] my side. I'm God has made a covenant
[1:19:19] with me by his own blood. I'm his child.
[1:19:21] every divine promise he died for is
[1:19:24] mine. We're more than able to overcome
[1:19:25] every devil. I mean, every cultural
[1:19:27] problem, every every family trait, we're
[1:19:30] more than able to overcome all things.
[1:19:32] Amen. Let's go in and take it at once.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But my servant Caleb,
[1:19:37] because he had another spirit with him,
[1:19:38] this is God testifying. He didn't have
[1:19:40] the spirit of the valley of decision. He
[1:19:43] had the spirit of God with him. That was
[1:19:45] the other spirit. And followed me fully.
[1:19:47] See, he wasn't just weighing up and he
[1:19:49] wasn't looking for a way out. He wasn't
[1:19:51] looking for a convenient time to
[1:19:52] disappear. Now he's like, I'm sold out.
[1:19:55] Where the pillar of fire leads, I'm
[1:19:56] following. Wherever that is, down
[1:19:59] through valleys, praise God. Up high
[1:20:00] mountains, praise God. Through bri
[1:20:02] patches, through the water, through the
[1:20:03] fire, through the flood, through
[1:20:05] trouble, strife, anguish, unanswered
[1:20:08] prayer, it seems to be sickness, sorrow,
[1:20:10] pain. I'm going all the way.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That was Caleb.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:17] Amen. This this this valley of um
[1:20:21] just trying to see where we can my notes
[1:20:24] are never in order now. This valley of
[1:20:25] Jehoshaphat Mr. Google tells me this is
[1:20:28] a valley mentioned in the Bible
[1:20:29] specifically in the book of Joel where
[1:20:31] it is prophesied that God will gather
[1:20:33] all nations for judgment. And I've shown
[1:20:35] you they're there before this judgment
[1:20:38] because the Lord is near. The day of the
[1:20:40] Lord is near in the valley of decision,
[1:20:42] right? And God will gather all nations.
[1:20:43] It's located east of Jerusalem between
[1:20:45] the city and the Mount of Olives. While
[1:20:47] the exact geographical locations is
[1:20:49] debated, it's often identified as the
[1:20:51] Kidedron Valley. Amen. The name
[1:20:53] Jehoshaphat itself means Jehovah has
[1:20:55] judged. Now this Kidron Valley, it's
[1:20:58] just east of Jerusalem. There's a lot of
[1:20:59] wonderful things have happened in the
[1:21:00] Kidron Valley. Amen. So in the Kidron
[1:21:03] Valley, Amen, is where idols were
[1:21:05] smashed.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where idolatry, where the temple
[1:21:08] was purged and you know, idols were were
[1:21:11] were destroyed. Amen. in the you know
[1:21:13] king king um you know when Assa became
[1:21:15] king he removed his mother as queen
[1:21:18] destroyed the idols all these things and
[1:21:19] what did he do he stamped it and burnt
[1:21:21] it at the brook kiddron amen this is in
[1:21:23] the valley of decision see when you make
[1:21:25] a clear-cut decision all the idols have
[1:21:27] to go it doesn't matter if it's a family
[1:21:30] heirloom of strife or temper or lust or
[1:21:32] or debate or or stiff neckness or
[1:21:34] indifference that thing's going down
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; amen and king Josiah brought out of the
[1:21:39] grove of the house of the Lord unto
[1:21:40] Jerusalem unto the book brook brook
[1:21:42] kiddron and burnt it at the brook
[1:21:44] kiddron and stamped it small to powder
[1:21:46] and cast the powder of upon the graves
[1:21:48] of the children of the people. So um um
[1:21:51] Josiah was you know uh he was 7 years
[1:21:53] old when he became king and his I think
[1:21:55] his grandmother Ailia um you know she
[1:21:58] was ruling she was the daughter of
[1:21:59] Jezebel she was ruling in Jerusalem but
[1:22:02] then but then Josiah was raised in
[1:22:04] secret because um Ailia wanted to kill
[1:22:06] all the royal seed but he was hidden
[1:22:08] when he became um seven he was made king
[1:22:10] and she was taken out by the horse gate
[1:22:12] and killed
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; that gate points to the valley of
[1:22:15] Kidron.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a religious Jezebel spirit gets
[1:22:18] killed there too. Amen. So all these
[1:22:20] things got destroyed. In the valley of
[1:22:22] Kron is the garden of Gethsemane.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; So in the garden of Gethsemane is where
[1:22:28] is where betrayal was manifested. Where
[1:22:30] Judas betrayed Jesus was manifested in
[1:22:32] the garden of Gethsemane in this valley
[1:22:35] of decision. He had made up his mind.
[1:22:36] I'm going to betray the word for a
[1:22:38] material gain.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; But then something else happened and I
[1:22:42] pray I can come around this. Okay. But
[1:22:44] this is how you get out of the valley.
[1:22:46] Because in the garden of Gethsemane,
[1:22:48] Jesus was in the valley of decision. He
[1:22:51] was there in the valley because he had
[1:22:52] to make up his mind. Will he become what
[1:22:55] he's ordained to be as the lamb of God?
[1:22:58] Will he fulfill the prophecy concerning
[1:23:00] himself? Will he do it?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. As he was in the valley there,
[1:23:05] agonizing there in the garden, sweat, so
[1:23:08] much agony in his body that drops of
[1:23:10] blood like sweat came down his brow. And
[1:23:13] he is weighing this up because he knew
[1:23:14] what he had to fulfill. He wasn't
[1:23:16] walking blindly to Calvary. He knew what
[1:23:19] he had to do and what would what he
[1:23:20] would face. Amen. But he was in the
[1:23:22] valley of decision and heaven was
[1:23:24] waiting for a reply. And then the reply
[1:23:27] came back. Lord, if it be thy will, take
[1:23:30] this cup. If it's possible, take this
[1:23:32] cup from me. Never lest not my will, but
[1:23:35] thy will be done. Amen. And that
[1:23:38] decision brought him out of the valley.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's how and what was
[1:23:42] it? It was a death to self. Amen. And it
[1:23:45] wasn't a well you know you know it
[1:23:47] wasn't just some indifferent thing. He
[1:23:48] knew the magnitude of his decision.
[1:23:50] Amen. But he said but the Bible says
[1:23:52] with joy
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; the joy set before him. Amen. So he's in
[1:23:56] the valley decision weighing up the cost
[1:23:58] that it would be upon himself. But he
[1:24:00] looked beyond the cost. He saw you and I
[1:24:02] redeemed. Hallelujah.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a death to self takes you
[1:24:07] out of the valley of decision. Amen.
[1:24:09] That's the only thing that will take you
[1:24:11] out. Not just a well I'm going to turn
[1:24:12] over a new leaf. No, you're still in the
[1:24:14] valley of decision. It's a death to
[1:24:16] self. You've got to sell out lock,
[1:24:18] stock, and barrel.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to make up your
[1:24:21] mind. That's how you get out of the
[1:24:23] valley.
[1:24:25] Amen. Sham Shamgal was in the valley of
[1:24:28] decision year after year. Philistines
[1:24:30] would come steal his crop. He didn't do
[1:24:33] anything about it. He would raise some
[1:24:35] wheat. They'd come in, they'd take it
[1:24:37] season after season. But he was in the
[1:24:39] valley of decision. He was of two minds.
[1:24:41] He
[1:24:43] he he received he had amnesia
[1:24:46] and he's just thinking, well, I've just
[1:24:48] got to survive and this is just how life
[1:24:50] is going to be. He was double-minded.
[1:24:52] I'm a son of Abraham, but there's the
[1:24:54] Philistines. I'm a son of Abraham, but
[1:24:55] there's the Philistines. But one day,
[1:24:57] when the crop, the harvest had come in
[1:24:59] and he heard the stomping of the boots
[1:25:01] down the road. 600 Philistines were
[1:25:03] coming to get his harvest. Amen. He
[1:25:05] looked he looked at his wife and she was
[1:25:07] half emaciated and his children, you
[1:25:09] know, raggedy and rag, you know, skin
[1:25:11] and bone, all these things. And
[1:25:12] something rose up in him. He said, "I'm
[1:25:14] going to stand up like a man.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with this." Amen. I'm
[1:25:17] going to come out of this valley of
[1:25:19] decision. I'm not going to be
[1:25:20] indifferent anymore and care about
[1:25:22] preserving my own skin. If I die
[1:25:24] fighting, I die fighting. Amen. But I am
[1:25:26] anointed to win because I'm a son of
[1:25:28] Abraham. Amen. So, he picked up his ox
[1:25:31] code. Amen. And brother Ram said he
[1:25:32] realized he was a son of Abraham and
[1:25:34] that made all the difference. He
[1:25:37] realized what he already was. Amen. And
[1:25:40] he came out of the valley of decision.
[1:25:41] He killed all 600 Philistines. Amen. And
[1:25:44] a revival broke out. Amen. Because the
[1:25:46] blessings he received of that harvest
[1:25:47] weren't given to the enemy. No, his
[1:25:49] family could enjoy it all. Amen. Why?
[1:25:52] Because he came out of the valley of
[1:25:53] decision.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel and Daniel and his friends,
[1:26:00] what's happened here?
[1:26:04] They were that age when they went to
[1:26:05] Babylon.
[1:26:08] They decided before they left, I'm going
[1:26:11] to serve God.
[1:26:13] I'm going to what if there's there was
[1:26:15] no church there.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; There's no minister there. There's no
[1:26:19] temple there. There weren't mom and dad
[1:26:21] there. It was them.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And they didn't walk like jellyfish
[1:26:24] saying, "Poor me and I'm just a I'm just
[1:26:26] a victim of circumstance." They said,
[1:26:27] "No, we're going to be Christians." I'll
[1:26:30] put it that way. In Babylon,
[1:26:33] they got out of the valley of decision.
[1:26:36] They made a choice.
[1:26:38] If they can do it, you think about this.
[1:26:41] They didn't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the blood of Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ. They didn't have all the
[1:26:45] mysteries revealed, right?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; They did not have what we have right
[1:26:50] now. And yet, they could stand and say,
[1:26:54] "This is me. What whatever happens
[1:26:56] because of my decision,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I made up my mind. They didn't know
[1:27:00] they'd be maybe thrown to a, you know,
[1:27:02] Daniel into the lion's den, the other
[1:27:04] three before the, you know, into the
[1:27:05] fiery furnace and all these things they
[1:27:07] had to face. But they made up their
[1:27:08] mind.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. This is who I am. It's
[1:27:12] not, it's more than what I do. It's who
[1:27:14] I am.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what did they do when the king
[1:27:18] tried to bring his food to them? They
[1:27:19] said, "No, we're not going to eat of the
[1:27:21] king's table." There's pressure there,
[1:27:23] man.
[1:27:25] They did not have some personal
[1:27:27] improvement plan they had to go through
[1:27:28] if they weren't doing their job. They
[1:27:31] got killed,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; right? They didn't have a, you know,
[1:27:34] they didn't have what we have if you're
[1:27:36] not doing what you meant to do. No, they
[1:27:37] just got axed. Out you go. Let's get
[1:27:39] someone else. But they stood because of
[1:27:41] that decision.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; I pray that we are the same way today.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we're not just reacting and
[1:27:48] poor me and this is this and this is
[1:27:50] this. Friends, if you're if jealousy
[1:27:53] rules your life, you're in the valley of
[1:27:55] decision. If you are if if you get
[1:27:58] offended when other people do better
[1:28:00] than you, you're in the valley of
[1:28:01] decision. Amen. Because you if you've
[1:28:04] given your life to the Lord, then you
[1:28:05] know your walk is personal. Your walk is
[1:28:08] not comparable to anyone else because
[1:28:11] God has ordained your footsteps. Amen.
[1:28:14] That whatever you go through is for you.
[1:28:16] It's not for anyone else. Right? It may
[1:28:19] affect other people by how you conduct
[1:28:20] yourself through the trial. Brother Ram
[1:28:22] said that we should conduct ourselves
[1:28:24] like sons and daughters of God in every
[1:28:26] trial. But how do you conduct yourself
[1:28:27] like that? Yeah, it's hard, but God's
[1:28:29] good.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; I'm being carried by him.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; How are you going? I don't know, but
[1:28:34] he's carrying me. Amen. I'm going
[1:28:36] through the trial. I'm going to come out
[1:28:37] the other side. God is working in this
[1:28:40] trial. Praise God. It's all for my good.
[1:28:43] Amen. God is using every moment and I'm
[1:28:45] savoring it. and I've decided I'm going
[1:28:47] to count it all joy cuz I've made a
[1:28:49] decision.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you're in the valley of
[1:28:52] decision, you look at, oh, this is
[1:28:54] happening and then this is happening.
[1:28:55] This is and we walk according to those
[1:28:57] things.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; But if you're sold out, you're sold out.
[1:29:02] Oh, your life is turned upside down. God
[1:29:04] allowed it. It's working for my good.
[1:29:08] He's not angry with me. He loves me.
[1:29:11] God's molding me.
[1:29:13] Praise the Lord. Don't you like the
[1:29:15] molding?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Thank God for those deserts of
[1:29:19] experience, Brother Bram says, where men
[1:29:21] and women are molded into saints.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Thank God for those moments. Thank God
[1:29:26] for the breaking.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the bruising. Thank God
[1:29:29] for the crushing. Like Jesus was the
[1:29:31] rose of Sharon, right? How do you get
[1:29:33] the perfume out of those pedals? It's
[1:29:34] got to be crushed. Amen. So, he had to
[1:29:36] go through a crushing for that life to
[1:29:38] be expressed.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got to look beyond
[1:29:44] our circumstances, what we're going
[1:29:45] through. We really got to look beyond
[1:29:47] it. Those in the wilderness were just
[1:29:49] looking at sand and scorpions and manner
[1:29:51] and things around them. Caleb and Joshua
[1:29:53] looking to the end
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; cuz they made a decision.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just going to read a couple of
[1:29:59] quotes, then we're going to
[1:30:02] wind this up. Every generation must have
[1:30:04] its own revival. Every generation has
[1:30:07] its own chance at the word. Every
[1:30:09] generation. This message is not just for
[1:30:12] old people and parents. It's for the
[1:30:15] young. It's for the teenager. I tell
[1:30:18] William, William, you're about the same
[1:30:19] age God started talking to Samuel at.
[1:30:22] You're that age. God is not You're never
[1:30:25] too young for God to speak. Amen. You're
[1:30:27] never too young for God to use you. I
[1:30:29] remember Lilia here was 18 months old,
[1:30:31] couldn't even really talk. And Corbus
[1:30:33] and Ha were here, Arman's parents, and
[1:30:35] he was battling and he was fighting cuz
[1:30:37] he was in the valley of decision. Do I
[1:30:38] keep with religion that's made me
[1:30:40] miserable or do I accept the word? He
[1:30:42] was in this valley and God was calling
[1:30:44] him. Come out of the valley and he's
[1:30:46] like, "Where's that phone that you can
[1:30:48] just pick up and talk to God? People say
[1:30:49] God talks and he never talks to me." And
[1:30:51] he was talking the whole time and God
[1:30:53] was dealing. And then we were there the
[1:30:55] last night that um you know they were
[1:30:56] there in New Zealand. They're going to
[1:30:58] fly out the next morning and decides to
[1:31:00] get baptized and he says flat. I'm not
[1:31:04] getting baptized.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; But God had other ideas. God would take
[1:31:08] a 18-month old girl, pick her up, get
[1:31:12] her to come stand before me as I'm
[1:31:13] reading Romans chapter 6. I still
[1:31:15] remember it to this day. I'm stand there
[1:31:16] by the couch. I'm reading Romans chapter
[1:31:18] 6. Before we baptize her in the bathtub,
[1:31:20] I see this little lilia come up and
[1:31:21] start pointing to the Bible. They have
[1:31:23] no idea what she's doing. Then she go
[1:31:25] and because Corbus is trying to get her
[1:31:27] to come sit and be still and sit down
[1:31:29] with him, but she just wouldn't. She
[1:31:31] came was pointing at the Bible, looked
[1:31:33] at him, pointed at the Bible, and then
[1:31:35] went and picked up a little mask and
[1:31:36] gave it to him. Then he broke down. He
[1:31:39] said, "God's just spoken to me through
[1:31:40] through through this little lilia here,
[1:31:42] saying, "Listen to the word and take off
[1:31:44] your religious mask." Amen. He got
[1:31:46] baptized. He came out of that water,
[1:31:48] raised his hands. Probably never done it
[1:31:49] in his life. Amen. A changed man. Why?
[1:31:52] Cuz he came out of the valley of
[1:31:54] decision. Amen. So it wasn't so what
[1:31:58] doesn't matter what he was raised in.
[1:31:59] when he saw the word, he had to make his
[1:32:01] mind up. Amen. And God used an 18-month
[1:32:04] old girl. So, we're never too young.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; We're never too old. Every generation
[1:32:08] must have its own revival.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're we go beyond just we
[1:32:14] go beyond just, you know, well, we're in
[1:32:16] the message. What does that even mean?
[1:32:18] If you're in the message, you you're in
[1:32:19] Christ. That's truly being in the
[1:32:21] message. If you're in the message, what
[1:32:23] that really means is that the pillar of
[1:32:25] fire, God himself, dwells in you. If
[1:32:27] he's not in you, you're not in the
[1:32:28] message. You're just gathered around it.
[1:32:32] Amen. He says this here. Now,
[1:32:35] I'm just going to read this. He says, he
[1:32:37] says here, there's a cycle. There's
[1:32:38] always a cycle of revival and death.
[1:32:41] Amen. It's like, it says to the saints
[1:32:43] of Ephesus alone that um he says, now
[1:32:45] you have left your first love. To
[1:32:47] understand this, you must realize that
[1:32:48] the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:32:49] original saints of Ephesus alone, but
[1:32:51] this message is to the entire age, which
[1:32:53] lasted about 120 years. Its message then
[1:32:56] is to all the generations in that span.
[1:32:58] Now history keeps repeating itself. In
[1:33:01] the generation of Israel, we see revival
[1:33:02] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:33:04] fading in the next. In the third
[1:33:06] generation, embers may be glowing
[1:33:08] slightly, but in the fourth, there may
[1:33:10] be no vestage whatsoever of that
[1:33:12] original flame. Then God lights the fire
[1:33:14] again and the same process is repeated.
[1:33:17] It is simply the manifestation of truth
[1:33:19] that God has no grandchildren. Amen. And
[1:33:22] you can be a grandparent and yet not
[1:33:24] have a revival. But God wants to restore
[1:33:27] it. God wants to give it. Amen. We got
[1:33:29] to get out of the valley of decision and
[1:33:31] say, "Well, I'm in church and I'm doing
[1:33:33] well." It's good to be in church. Come
[1:33:34] to church, whatever you do. But don't
[1:33:36] think that coming to church saves you.
[1:33:38] You must know him. Amen. You must have
[1:33:40] your own personal revival. But the only
[1:33:43] way to do it, friends, is come out of
[1:33:45] the valley of decision.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come out of the valley of decision
[1:33:50] like Jesus did. You got to die out to
[1:33:52] all those things. What's holding you
[1:33:54] back?
[1:33:55] Should be nothing. But your life is
[1:33:58] telling you what's holding you back. Oh,
[1:34:00] another day, another Sunday, another
[1:34:02] moment. What about today? I've always
[1:34:05] been this way. You need a change.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I had a joyouish time 10 years
[1:34:10] ago. What about now? What is your life
[1:34:13] producing now? I know this. I'm I'm
[1:34:14] talking to me, too.
[1:34:16] Have we just got to a place where we
[1:34:18] just go through the motions?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Or are we rejoicing in the goodness and
[1:34:23] mercy and love of God? Are we thankful
[1:34:26] that he saved us? Are we thankful that
[1:34:28] he found us? We're so glad we said,
[1:34:30] "Lord, I'm so glad, Lord, when I
[1:34:32] surrender my whole being into your hands
[1:34:34] or has it just become some common
[1:34:36] callous thing and it's just critical and
[1:34:38] there's trouble and all you see is the
[1:34:39] problems." Come out of the valley.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Come into the promised land. Come into
[1:34:44] Christ. Amen. Because if you look at a
[1:34:47] valley, I don't live in a valley. I live
[1:34:50] on the mountaintop. Now, if you live on
[1:34:52] the valley naturally now, that's fine.
[1:34:54] Okay? But I like being on the mountain.
[1:34:56] I like being on the mountain. Amen. Look
[1:34:59] at down those valleys. Gloomy shadows,
[1:35:02] damp, cold, fog.
[1:35:07] Why not be where the air is clear? The
[1:35:10] sunshine is striking your glorious face.
[1:35:13] Amen. This sen, the sunlight of God is
[1:35:15] striking. You feel its warmth. You feel
[1:35:17] its lifegiving flow of the word. I mean,
[1:35:19] you're not down in the valley where it's
[1:35:21] dark and dismal and damp and moss and
[1:35:23] all that stuff. No, you're standing on
[1:35:25] the mountain.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley today.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley. Well, I've been
[1:35:31] raised in this church. I've been raised
[1:35:32] in this church. Come out of the valley.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Sell out
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; whatever you do
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; and come up on the mountain. The air is
[1:35:42] good up there.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It's full of joy.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; It's full of peace. It's a It's a
[1:35:47] bubbling fountain. You I was talking to
[1:35:49] William. We're driving. I was talking
[1:35:50] about, you know, Moses, you know,
[1:35:52] speaking to the rock and the and the
[1:35:54] water came out of the rock. And I was
[1:35:55] just imagining this big massive gusher
[1:35:57] because it it it it watered two million
[1:35:59] people and their animals. Wasn't this
[1:36:00] little trickle that came out this nice
[1:36:02] tranquil pull? That thing would have
[1:36:04] been a big gusher shooting up. It be
[1:36:06] such a pressure behind it. I mean, it
[1:36:08] would have flooded the whole place. They
[1:36:09] would have been drinking. Why? Because I
[1:36:12] say that's what happens when you make up
[1:36:14] your mind and you sell out to God. Amen.
[1:36:16] What? He becomes an inexhaustible
[1:36:18] fountain that's bubbling out of your
[1:36:20] life continually. I mean, you don't have
[1:36:22] to pump it, prime it. It's just pushing.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, why not come out the
[1:36:26] valley this morning?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians, please.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians. I just
[1:36:33] want to leave that there. Isn't it a
[1:36:34] great view?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? Who's ever who's
[1:36:38] come out of the valley?
[1:36:41] who's decided to follow Jesus.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; The valley's
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; the mountaintop is great.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] Amen. Let's stand.
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:36:59] I want to sing that song all the way.
[1:37:00] I'm going all the way. I'm going all the
[1:37:03] way with the Lord. I pray this morning
[1:37:06] this is more than a song.
[1:37:10] But it's a reality. And if you haven't,
[1:37:13] it's like the Bible says as many as
[1:37:15] believe were baptized. What hinders?
[1:37:18] Oh, my dad or my mom or No, it's you and
[1:37:20] God. When I stand there on that day,
[1:37:23] it's not me and my family. It's not even
[1:37:26] me and you as an it's me and as an
[1:37:28] individual before God. And I will give
[1:37:30] account for what I did. And the excuses
[1:37:34] of peers and family and things, they
[1:37:37] won't stand.
[1:37:38] It's you and God. It's your salvation.
[1:37:41] It's your soul. It's your eternal
[1:37:43] destination. It's you.
[1:37:46] So why not when we sing this in your
[1:37:48] heart say, "Lord, I'm going all the way.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; If I've got to be baptized, Lord, I'll
[1:37:52] get baptized. I'll give my life. Lord,
[1:37:54] I'll get baptized. Lord, if I've got to
[1:37:56] if I got to die out to this jealous,
[1:37:58] indifferent spirit, this this this
[1:38:01] complaining, whatever it is, I want it
[1:38:03] gone, Lord.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in the desert. I
[1:38:06] don't want to be complaining like the
[1:38:07] children of Israel. I want to be on the
[1:38:09] mountain in the promised land. Amen.
[1:38:12] Rejoicing in the goodness and reality of
[1:38:14] God. Hallelujah.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's sing this as a
[1:38:19] declaration this morning. Amen. All the
[1:38:24] way.
[1:38:27] I'm going all the way.
[1:38:31] All the way.
[1:38:35] I'm going all the way.
[1:38:40] All the way.
[1:38:44] I'm going all the way.
[1:38:48] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:38:53] Let's sing that again, shall we?
[1:38:56] Oh, all
[1:38:58] the way.
[1:39:01] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:05] All the way.
[1:39:09] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:14] All the way.
[1:39:17] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:22] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:39:30] I made my decision.
[1:39:34] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:38] I'll make my choice.
[1:39:42] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:47] I'll make my decision.
[1:39:51] I'm going all the way.
[1:39:55] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:03] No turning
[1:40:06] back.
[1:40:08] I'm going all the way.
[1:40:11] No turning
[1:40:14] back.
[1:40:16] I'm going all the way.
[1:40:20] No turning
[1:40:22] back. back. I'm going all the way.
[1:40:28] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:37] I've drawn
[1:40:39] the line. Have you drawn the line? I'm
[1:40:41] going all the way.
[1:40:45] No turning
[1:40:47] back.
[1:40:49] I'm going all the way.
[1:40:53] I've drawn
[1:40:55] the line.
[1:40:58] I'm going all the way.
[1:41:02] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:41:07] Let's go to verse two. Have you made
[1:41:08] your decision, friends? I'll make my
[1:41:12] decision.
[1:41:15] I'm going all the way.
[1:41:18] I'll make
[1:41:20] my choice.
[1:41:23] I'm going all the way.
[1:41:27] I'll make my decision.
[1:41:31] I'm going all the way.
[1:41:35] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:41:42] I mean just softly. All the way
[1:41:48] I'm going all the way.
[1:41:53] All the way
[1:41:57] I'm going all the way.
[1:42:02] All
[1:42:04] the way.
[1:42:06] I'm going all the way.
[1:42:11] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Just want to
[1:42:24] ask you a question. If you want prayer,
[1:42:26] you're more than welcome to come
[1:42:27] forward. But have you really have you
[1:42:30] really made your choice? Have you really
[1:42:33] decided or are you in the valley of
[1:42:35] decision saying, "Well, I'll just hang
[1:42:37] around church. It seems all fine. I
[1:42:39] don't really need to step out and walk
[1:42:40] with the Lord.
[1:42:42] What choice have you made? I pray today
[1:42:46] that your choice is Lord, all I am is
[1:42:49] yours. My life is in your hands. Lord,
[1:42:52] take all of me, oh God.
[1:42:55] Hallelujah. If you want to be remembered
[1:42:57] in prayer, just want to slip up your
[1:42:58] hands, say, "Lord, remember me, Lord
[1:43:01] Jesus." We just open our hearts to him.
[1:43:03] Let's just talk to him together.
[1:43:05] Gracious heavenly father, as we raise
[1:43:07] our hands, Lord, I've raised both of
[1:43:10] mine. You see the hands that have been
[1:43:12] raised, dear God.
[1:43:14] Father, I just want to commit everyone
[1:43:16] into your hands. Lord, I believe I've
[1:43:18] delivered what you've placed on my heart
[1:43:19] today as you said that it's in this day
[1:43:23] multitudes are in the valley of
[1:43:25] decision.
[1:43:27] God, may none of us stay in the valley.
[1:43:29] Lord Jesus, forbid it, Lord, that any of
[1:43:32] us would stay in that valley between two
[1:43:34] minds, two opinions, two things which we
[1:43:37] think is right, dear God. Father,
[1:43:39] there's only one thing that's right,
[1:43:41] Lord. There's only one way. You are the
[1:43:42] way, the truth, and the life. So, dear
[1:43:44] God, I pray, Father, would we, Lord,
[1:43:46] that we would realize, Lord, if there's
[1:43:48] something hindering us, may we realize
[1:43:50] what it is, Lord. It's the enemy trying
[1:43:52] to stop us from selling out, giving our
[1:43:55] lives, being baptized in your name,
[1:43:57] laying aside every weight and sin and
[1:44:00] walking with you, dear God. I pray,
[1:44:02] Father, none of us would be in the
[1:44:03] valley, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name, I
[1:44:06] commit each one into your hands. Father,
[1:44:08] for your glory, have your way. I pray in
[1:44:10] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:44:14] Amen.
[1:44:16] Amen. Let's sing that song. I got my
[1:44:17] mind made up and I won't turn back. I
[1:44:20] want to see my Jesus someday.

[1:44:25] your heart. Amen.

[1:58:16] everything, God has been good.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe you just keep just
[1:58:20] love the Lord. You be you. Don't become

[1:58:30] Every stage of the journey is good.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. And we know this is not the end,
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; right? So we we're going to pray for
[1:58:39] you. Of course. It's been a privilege.

[1:59:46] longer. But you know there's always
[1:59:49] transitions in life. Some are easy, some
[1:59:52] are not easy. But the thing is the main
[1:59:55] thing is we're in Christ. That is the
[1:59:58] main thing. That's really the only thing
[2:00:00] that matters. And thanks be to God we
[2:00:02] can say you're in the Lord. Okay. So
[2:00:04] let's let's bow bow our heads and our
[2:00:07] hearts and let's commit them into your
[2:00:08] hand. Commit the Shurig family. Gracious
[2:00:10] father how glad we are. Lord, we are so
[2:00:14] thankful
[2:00:15] for what you have done. Lord, truly,
[2:00:18] they are trophies of your amazing grace.
[2:00:21] Lord, when they left South Africa, they
[2:00:22] had no idea what awaited them on the
[2:00:24] side. But you ordained their steps, my
[2:00:26] God. You caused them to come of all
[2:00:29] places to Wellington, Lord. Of all
[2:00:31] places to Stokes Valley, Lord, of all
[2:00:34] places, Lord. You planted them there,
[2:00:37] dear God, because you had a divine
[2:00:38] appointment with their lives, Lord. That
[2:00:40] they would never be the same, Father.
[2:00:42] They came in more in contact more than
[2:00:45] just with a church,
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; or even just more in contact with a more
[2:00:48] than a prophet, my God. But Lord,
[2:00:50] they've come in contact with your mighty
[2:00:52] God, the voice behind the voice. So,
[2:00:54] Father, I pray, dear God, as they uh
[2:00:56] this is their last Sunday together, we
[2:00:58] just want to pray their your richest
[2:01:00] blessings upon their lives. Lord,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Father, may they just continue to love
[2:01:05] you.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, may they never let a negative
[2:01:07] thought, nothing negative come into
[2:01:09] their hearts, dear God. Lord, you know
[2:01:11] what they're going to face up in fun.
[2:01:13] Dear God, you know all about it, Lord.
[2:01:15] You have been in their future, Lord. As
[2:01:16] brother Isaac preached many years ago
[2:01:18] now. Lord, you've been in our future.
[2:01:20] You know about it, dear God. So, I pray,
[2:01:22] Father, may you continue to lead them,
[2:01:24] continue to guide them. Father, may it
[2:01:26] be you and you alone leading them. And
[2:01:28] may they continue to be the Stuig
[2:01:30] family, Lord. May they be them, Lord.
[2:01:32] May they be you.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; May May they be them and you, dear God.
[2:01:36] Father, how you built them, Father. May
[2:01:37] they not try and be like anyone else.
[2:01:39] And Father, may you shine through them,
[2:01:41] Lord, like only you can. The unique way
[2:01:43] you've built them, Father. Dear God, may
[2:01:45] you touch many lives up there, wherever
[2:01:47] you'd have them go, Father. Lord, may
[2:01:49] they continue to be the salt of the
[2:01:50] earth. Father, full of love and joy and
[2:01:53] thanksgiving and thankfulness, Father.
[2:01:55] May you grant it in the name of Jesus
[2:01:56] Christ. I pray, Father, for this next
[2:01:58] season, Lord, as brother Aman goes up
[2:02:00] and he's looking for a house and there's
[2:02:01] all the schools and different things,
[2:02:03] Lord God, these logistics, but we thank
[2:02:05] you, Lord, that you already know, Lord
[2:02:07] Jesus, you know the right spots, Father.
[2:02:09] So, Lord, I just want to commit them
[2:02:10] into your hands. May this transition be
[2:02:12] smooth, Lord. It'll be very sad to see
[2:02:15] them eventually all go. But, Father, we
[2:02:17] just want to send them under your
[2:02:18] anointing, Lord, under the shadow of
[2:02:20] your great wings, dear God. May they
[2:02:21] continue to walk in victory. Father, we
[2:02:23] commit them into your hands. We thank
[2:02:25] you for their lives, Lord, in Jesus
[2:02:27] Christ's name. Amen.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:06:42] I finished it last night, but I started
[2:06:44] writing it um
[2:06:50] in February. So, in February when it was
[2:06:53] summertime, I'd go on walks in the
[2:06:54] morning. And one morning I was walking
[2:06:56] back and it was early and I saw the
[2:06:59] sunrise above the hills and I looked out
[2:07:01] and then a line came to me and
[2:07:07] and the line said, "I'm a wash with your
[2:07:10] mercy in the morning." And I thought,
[2:07:11] "Oh, I really like that line. I'm going
[2:07:13] to make a song." And I didn't the line
[2:07:15] didn't make it to the song, but it
[2:07:17] definitely inspired it. And so after I
[2:07:19] got home, I started looking up. I'm not
[2:07:21] a musician. I can't really play or do
[2:07:24] anything out of the ordinary. I can't
[2:07:26] write songs like that. I can't play the
[2:07:27] piano like some people. But I just
[2:07:30] really like this thought of there being
[2:07:32] something
[2:07:36] something special in the morning. So I
[2:07:38] got home and I started looking at all
[2:07:39] the scriptures and I've been reading a
[2:07:41] lot of Psalms. And David really likes
[2:07:43] mentioning the morning in his Psalms. So
[2:07:46] I started looking into David's story and
[2:07:51] something that David went through caught
[2:07:54] my eye. So when him and Ba Sheba had
[2:07:56] their she was in travail with their
[2:07:58] first child, the child of their
[2:07:59] adultery. And the scripture says that
[2:08:02] David fasted and he lay upon the ground
[2:08:04] all night. And then in the morning, you
[2:08:08] know, the servants were scared to tell
[2:08:09] him that his son had died, but he heard
[2:08:13] them whispering. And then he got up and
[2:08:15] he said, "Is it as he did?" And they
[2:08:17] said, "Yes." And then he got up, he
[2:08:18] washed himself, he anointed himself, he
[2:08:20] got new clothes, and he moved on.
[2:08:24] And
[2:08:27] I don't know why I'm shaking cuz I know
[2:08:29] you guys pretty well.
[2:08:31] But I just thought, you know, I quite
[2:08:34] like that story. I like how David, even
[2:08:36] though he went through something really
[2:08:37] terrible and he had a such a big mistake
[2:08:41] in his life and he went through so much
[2:08:44] suffering because of it, he was able to
[2:08:46] come through the other side and he was
[2:08:48] clean.
[2:08:50] So I wrote a song called In the Morning
[2:08:54] and I haven't practiced it cuz I
[2:08:57] finished it last night, but I set I set
[2:08:59] myself a deadline last night. I thought
[2:09:01] it'd be cool to sing it before the
[2:09:02] Stuigs go, but I didn't know when the
[2:09:04] Stuigs were going. So, when I got here
[2:09:05] this morning and they were like, "This
[2:09:06] is the Stuigs last Sunday." I thought,
[2:09:08] "Oh, I better sing it quick." So, now
[2:09:11] I'm here and I'm going to try and sing
[2:09:12] it for you guys. Even though I hope
[2:09:14] you'll have a lot of pity on me. I
[2:09:15] haven't practiced it like in full
[2:09:16] before. Okay. So, we'll see how it goes.
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:58] They say you're safe.
[2:10:02] They say you heal.
[2:10:05] They call you great,
[2:10:09] the God of grace.
[2:10:13] So I will call. Sorry guys, let me
[2:10:16] restart.
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:19] Say you save.
[2:10:23] Say you heal.
[2:10:26] They call you great.
[2:10:29] The God of grace.
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:33] So I will call
[2:10:36] upon the name,
[2:10:39] the one that's raised
[2:10:42] above my shame.
[2:10:45] And it's so dark and I can't see you.
[2:10:51] Will you hear my prayer?
[2:10:55] I'm so nervous. Can I redo that, please?
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry.
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:14] They say you save.
[2:11:17] They say you heal.
[2:11:21] They call you great.
[2:11:25] The God of grace.
[2:11:28] So I will call
[2:11:32] on the name
[2:11:35] the name that's raised
[2:11:38] above my shame
[2:11:42] and is so dark and I can't see you
[2:11:48] but will you hear my prayer in the
[2:11:51] morning Lord
[2:11:54] and will you hear my cries as they arise
[2:11:58] in the morning
[2:12:01] And will you see my hands raised against
[2:12:05] the canvas of the dawning sky? And will
[2:12:09] you come with the morning
[2:12:13] line?
[2:12:15] They say to pray,
[2:12:18] to call out in faith.
[2:12:22] They say to shout
[2:12:25] the loudest praise.
[2:12:28] that I'll just speak.
[2:12:31] The sinners plead.
[2:12:35] Forgive my grief.
[2:12:38] You're all I need.
[2:12:41] But it's so dark and I can't see you.
[2:12:48] Will you hear my prayer
[2:12:53] in the morning, Lord?
[2:12:56] And will you hear my cries as they arise
[2:12:59] in the morning?
[2:13:02] And will you see my hands raised against
[2:13:06] the canvas of the dawning sky? And will
[2:13:10] you come with the morning?
[2:13:16] Will you hear my prayer
[2:13:20] in the morning, Lord?
[2:13:23] Will you hear my cries as they arise in
[2:13:26] the morning light?
[2:13:29] And will you see my hands raised against
[2:13:33] the canvas of the dawning sky and will
[2:13:37] you come with the morning
[2:13:41] light?
[2:13:43] So arise, be washed, be anointed by the
[2:13:49] Lord. My hands are clean, my praises
[2:13:53] have been heard.
[2:13:56] Arise, be washed, be anointed by the
[2:14:02] Lord. My hands are clean, my praises
[2:14:06] have been heard.
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:12] You have heard my prayers in the
[2:14:15] morning, Lord.
[2:14:18] You have heavens
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:27] at last. You're reaching with the sky.
[2:14:32] And will you come with the morning
[2:14:36] light?
[2:14:42] [Applause]
[2:14:53] Praise the Lord. You're dismissed in
[2:14:54] Jesus name this afternoon.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Thanks Hannah. That was really good.
[2:15:15] Who told the sun where to stand in the
[2:15:19] morning?
[2:15:22] Who told the ocean
[2:15:24] you can only come this far?
[2:15:30] And who told the moon
[2:15:34] where to hide till evening?
[2:15:37] Whose words alone can catch a falling
[2:15:42] star?
[2:15:44] Well, I know
[2:15:46] my redeemer
[2:15:48] lives.
[2:15:52] I know
[2:15:54] my redeemer
[2:15:56] lives.
[2:15:59] Let all creation testify.
[2:16:03] Let this life within me cry. I know my
[2:16:09] redeemer
[2:16:10] lives.
[2:16:13] very same God that spit
[2:16:21] runs to the weary
[2:16:24] one and the weak
[2:16:28] and the same gentle hands
[2:16:33] help me when I'm broken
[2:16:36] they conquer death to bring me victory
[2:16:39] Glory.
[2:16:43] Well, I know my redeemer
[2:16:47] live.
[2:16:49] [Applause]

[2:17:08] redeemer.
[2:17:12] He lives
[2:17:14] to take away my shame.
[2:17:19] And he lives
[2:17:22] forever. I'll proclaim
[2:17:27] that the payment for my sin
[2:17:31] was a precious life he gave. But now
[2:17:35] he's alive and there's an empty
[2:17:39] grave.
[2:17:41] Well, I know my redeemer
[2:17:46] lives.

[2:18:40] here.
[2:18:43] [Music]
