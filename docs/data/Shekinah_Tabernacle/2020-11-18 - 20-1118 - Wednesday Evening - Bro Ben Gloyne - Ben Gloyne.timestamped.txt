[28:46] amen god bless your friends you may have
[28:48] your seats tonight so i want to
[28:50] if i can take a um if i can take a
[28:53] subject i want to speak about the
[28:54] merging of dimensions now we're living
[28:56] in a great time where
[28:58] where eternity and time are blending
[29:00] together where the unseen world is
[29:02] becoming visible
[29:03] hallelujah this is an incredible time
[29:05] you look through the scripture
[29:07] every time redemption begins to play out
[29:09] there's visitations of angels god comes
[29:11] to the earth
[29:12] amen and that unseen world becomes
[29:15] visible
[29:15] among the people hallelujah you know we
[29:18] can read and um
[29:19] you know if we go to exodus chapter
[29:21] three where we can see a
[29:23] a time of exodus here where where there
[29:26] was a there was a redemption was going
[29:28] to take place under the blood of bulls
[29:29] and goats where god was going to
[29:31] redeem his people israel from slavery
[29:34] and he was going to take them and put
[29:35] them into the promised land now was the
[29:37] time
[29:38] and i just want to maybe just drop this
[29:40] in from the get-go i want you to
[29:41] recognize
[29:42] it's not man reaching up to god it's god
[29:45] when he reaches down to man
[29:47] when god begins to you know kind of
[29:49] merge you know between this world into
[29:51] you know that world into this world and
[29:53] begins to make himself real
[29:54] it's when those kind of uh events take
[29:57] place on the earth god is doing
[29:58] something major
[29:59] and i'll say heaven comes down expands
[30:01] upon the earth
[30:02] that god would collect all of his
[30:04] predestinated scenic seed and take them
[30:06] up into a
[30:07] into a rapture so so we can see that you
[30:09] know in this first exodus they did not
[30:11] go from this world to the next world but
[30:13] they'd be taken from egypt into the
[30:15] promised land and we read here in exodus
[30:17] three and and verses six to eight he
[30:20] says moreover he said i am the god of
[30:22] thy father the god of abraham
[30:24] the god of isaac and the god of jacob
[30:26] and moses hit his face
[30:28] for he is afraid to look upon god and
[30:30] the lord said i have surely
[30:32] seen the affliction of my people which
[30:34] are in egypt and have heard their cry by
[30:36] the reason of their task masters
[30:38] for i know their sorrows i'm glad he
[30:40] knows our sorrows
[30:41] i mean i have come down i have come down
[30:43] to deliver
[30:44] them out of the hand of the egyptians
[30:46] and i'm come down out
[30:48] sorry and to bring them up out of that
[30:50] land into a good land in a large unto a
[30:53] land flowing with milk and honey
[30:54] and to a place of the canaanite the
[30:56] hittite the amorite uh and the
[30:58] peshizai the high fight and the jebusite
[31:00] so god says i've heard thy cry
[31:03] they couldn't deliver themselves they
[31:05] couldn't free themselves from the yoke
[31:06] of bondage
[31:07] so god heard their cry and said now
[31:09] there's going to be a time of redemption
[31:11] where i'm going to redeem them i'm going
[31:13] to purchase them and i'm going to take
[31:14] them out of egypt and put them into the
[31:16] promised land and
[31:18] and i like schofield's notes when he
[31:20] talks about the redemption out of egypt
[31:22] because
[31:22] he says god does redemption in two ways
[31:24] by blood and by power
[31:26] i mean by the blood of the lamb they
[31:27] were brought out that passover lamb and
[31:29] by powers the power of god that
[31:31] took them out of egypt so so now here
[31:33] here is you know there had been i don't
[31:35] know how many years
[31:36] you know of your 400 odd years of
[31:38] silence where there's no visitation of
[31:40] god to the people
[31:41] there was no prophet in the land there
[31:43] was nothing but then finally comes the
[31:44] season of redemption
[31:46] where god comes down and he begins to
[31:48] deliver israel he begins to speak to
[31:50] moses
[31:50] the god that he just heard about stepped
[31:52] out of history and became a reality
[31:55] hallelujah and then and then you know
[31:57] you can go through the book of judges
[31:59] and
[31:59] and you know every time there's you know
[32:00] they would fall that people of israel
[32:02] would fall into bondage
[32:04] god would come down like you'd speak to
[32:06] gideon or or he would speak to the
[32:07] mother of samson and
[32:09] you know you know he would he would
[32:10] deliver a message and and redemption are
[32:12] redeeming would take place where the
[32:14] people were no longer under bondage but
[32:16] they became free
[32:17] i mean so they were visitations of
[32:19] angels god would come upon the earth he
[32:21] would speak to his children
[32:22] as like eternity just kind of reached
[32:24] into time and did something hallelujah
[32:28] amen we can even see where you know uh
[32:31] you know there's 400 years of silence
[32:33] from from malachi to john
[32:35] there's no move of the spirit there's
[32:37] nothing recorded of god doing anything
[32:39] but then finally it's like the wheels of
[32:41] prophecy turn and god begins to now it's
[32:44] not just under the blood of bulls and
[32:45] goats being taken from egypt into a
[32:47] promised land
[32:48] but now people are going to be taken
[32:49] under the bondage of sin
[32:51] and they're going to be born again
[32:52] they're going to be made the sons of god
[32:54] redeem back to their rightful position
[32:56] in christ amen to god sends visitations
[32:58] of angels
[33:00] hallelujah gabriel went to mary amen
[33:03] yo you know zechariah or have you say
[33:06] his name the father of john was was was
[33:08] ministering there before the altar of
[33:10] incense and angel spoke to him
[33:12] these things hadn't happened before for
[33:13] many many years but god was
[33:15] eternity heaven was expanding down upon
[33:18] the earth because redemption was going
[33:19] to come
[33:20] to adam's fallen race hallelujah mean
[33:23] then then joseph you know the angel
[33:25] would would speak to him in a dream
[33:27] about don't fear to take marry thy wife
[33:28] because
[33:29] the child that she's carrying is of the
[33:31] holy ghost and you know the wise men
[33:33] were warned you know supernaturally and
[33:35] you know in dreams and
[33:36] you know god was doing something heaven
[33:38] was coming down upon the earth where
[33:40] where it was just theology and debate
[33:42] now it became reality
[33:44] that god was reaching through hallelujah
[33:46] and he was speaking to his children
[33:48] because redemption was taking place
[33:50] hallelujah and then so finally we know
[33:52] that the lord jesus was born
[33:54] amen and the shepherds were there they
[33:56] were just minding their own business on
[33:58] the hillside by bethlehem and
[34:00] then an angel of peace and they you know
[34:02] you know he says fear not
[34:04] i bring great tidings of your good times
[34:06] of great joy was heaven was declaring
[34:08] something
[34:09] hallelujah that that the very messiah
[34:11] that you've been looking for he's upon
[34:12] the earth right now you'll find him in a
[34:14] manger in bethlehem
[34:16] hallelujah and it wasn't just that but
[34:17] then a whole choir of angels filled the
[34:19] sky and begin to sing the first you know
[34:21] first song of the redeemer coming to the
[34:23] earth hallelujah
[34:25] that happened happened before but
[34:27] redemption was taking place
[34:28] i mean so there were visitations of
[34:30] angels hallelujah
[34:31] amen then the shepherds went and they
[34:33] found exactly where jesus was they began
[34:35] to tell everyone about it hallelujah
[34:38] amen then and then and then our lord
[34:40] comes into his ministry
[34:42] and we know that angels visited him in
[34:44] the wilderness
[34:45] right after he received the holy ghost
[34:47] down river jordan he went there
[34:49] tempted by the devil the angels came and
[34:50] strengthened him after he made up his
[34:52] mind in gethsemane i'm going through
[34:54] with this lord jesus
[34:55] you know i'm going through with this god
[34:57] not my will but thy will be done angels
[34:59] came and strengthened him
[35:00] there were visitations of angels
[35:02] hallelujah after the resurrection
[35:04] there was visitations of angels you know
[35:07] there was a you know
[35:08] you know they went up where you know
[35:10] mount transfiguration or the amount of
[35:12] ascension whichever one it was jesus was
[35:13] taken up into heaven
[35:15] and they're looking up and then there's
[35:16] two men appeared in white yes
[35:18] they're a visitation of angels because
[35:20] remember redemption isn't just coming
[35:22] out it's going in
[35:23] there's two parts of redemption so now
[35:25] now the going out had taken place but
[35:27] now it's going to bring a people into
[35:28] christ holy they're going to receive the
[35:30] holy ghost right
[35:31] there are visitations of angels then we
[35:33] have the upper room yo pentecost who's
[35:35] following me
[35:37] what i'm trying to say is you know if we
[35:39] could just look into the unseen world
[35:42] amen it's more than just us in this
[35:43] battle you know we read there and daniel
[35:45] you know
[35:46] at this time michael the great prince is
[35:48] going to stand up for his people
[35:51] hallelujah it's and that's not a
[35:52] physical man that's that's a mighty
[35:54] angel standing up
[35:56] holy that he's going to begin to come
[35:57] upon the earth and things are going to
[35:58] happen
[35:59] hallelujah the world is falling apart
[36:01] but we're in good hands
[36:03] we're in the best hands that they've
[36:04] ever been we're in the hands of almighty
[36:06] god
[36:07] highly not to fall into judgment but to
[36:09] be redeemed
[36:10] hallelujah so we've got to have great
[36:12] confidence you know it doesn't matter
[36:14] what the world does who cares about what
[36:15] they're doing
[36:16] i mean god is just reaching through
[36:19] to get a hold of his elected ones and
[36:22] whosoever will let them come
[36:25] hallelujah so then the upper room
[36:28] happens god fills
[36:29] fills his church with the holy ghost but
[36:31] yet there's still visitations of angels
[36:32] taking place
[36:34] peter would be in a jail he'd be asleep
[36:37] he'd be chained to two men an angel came
[36:39] hit him on the side wake up
[36:41] chains fell off and it was an answer to
[36:43] prayer
[36:44] because the believers were having a
[36:46] prayer meeting because they didn't want
[36:47] to see peter get killed
[36:48] i mean so even if we could not
[36:49] physically get to someone god didn't
[36:51] send an angel
[36:52] holy or someone oh they're out of reach
[36:54] no they're not out of reach
[36:55] heaven can reach anywhere hallelujah
[36:58] around the globe heaven can reach
[36:59] anywhere
[37:00] hallelujah so that angel woke him up his
[37:03] two guys stayed asleep he got up he
[37:05] thought he was having a dream or
[37:06] something
[37:07] followed the angel ride out came to the
[37:09] outside of the prison then he came to
[37:10] himself well that wasn't a dream i'm
[37:12] free
[37:13] hallelujah hallelujah the apostle paul
[37:16] who was still saul at the time was on
[37:18] his way to damascus he met the lord on
[37:20] the road to damascus
[37:21] an angel came to ananias said here comes
[37:23] paul
[37:25] you'll find him street called straight
[37:26] this is where you know who knows the
[37:28] story
[37:29] if i've got it wrong silently say well
[37:30] i'll fix it later
[37:32] hallelujah but you know what i'm talking
[37:35] about
[37:36] i mean to the visitations of angels you
[37:38] know
[37:40] paul would say when he was on the ship
[37:42] on the way to rome and there was a big
[37:44] storm and 14 days of didn't see the sun
[37:46] that blonde to and fro
[37:47] he says the angel of the lord of who i
[37:50] am and who i
[37:50] serve told me this night there'll be no
[37:53] loss of any life on the ship
[37:55] but the ship itself will be lost
[37:57] hallelujah there's visitation of angels
[38:00] amen now if there's a visitation if
[38:03] there was a mighty outpouring of heaven
[38:05] in the beginning of the church should
[38:07] there not be a mighty outpouring of
[38:09] heaven at the end of the church
[38:11] right i think if the alpha bride had a
[38:13] visitation of angels
[38:14] remember cornelius was praying an angel
[38:17] visited him
[38:18] he wasn't even under the atonement yet
[38:19] but he was he was a devout man
[38:21] but god wanted to bring him under the
[38:23] law and to grace and an angel visited
[38:25] him
[38:26] hallelujah amen so so if there were
[38:29] a mighty a mighty visitation of angels
[38:32] in the beginning
[38:33] would it not be strange for it to happen
[38:36] at the end
[38:37] if we have been restored back to a book
[38:39] of acts
[38:42] i just i just want to i pray that we'll
[38:45] just
[38:46] look at the world a bit differently you
[38:48] may well i know these things but but is
[38:49] it real to you
[38:51] is it real that there can be angels in
[38:53] an unseen realm
[38:54] well i don't feel them i doubt very much
[38:56] gerhardi felt them when he woke up that
[38:58] morning in dothan
[39:00] and he looked and saw the assyrians
[39:01] around the city and he was panicking
[39:03] because
[39:03] he said master basically we're whipped
[39:05] you know this is the end of it you know
[39:06] they're going to take the city they're
[39:08] going to kill us and
[39:09] elisha just said well lord he prayed
[39:11] lord open his eyes
[39:13] and he saw chariots of fire the whole
[39:14] army of heaven around
[39:16] halloween he didn't feel them but they
[39:18] were there the whole time remember the
[39:19] prayer didn't bring the army of heaven
[39:21] down the army of heaven was already
[39:23] around the prophet of god
[39:25] hallelujah and i'll say if it was around
[39:27] the prophet of god in the old testament
[39:29] do you not think it would be around the
[39:30] bride of jesus christ today
[39:32] hallelujah so lord jesus open our eyes
[39:35] amen in this room now is more than the
[39:37] people you see
[39:38] amen the angels of god gather holy they
[39:41] come
[39:42] down they anoint our faith they're with
[39:43] us and not just them but god himself
[39:45] comes down
[39:46] inhabits the praises of his people
[39:49] hallelujah i happen to believe it
[39:52] at every great junction of time if you
[39:54] haven't listened to a
[39:55] impactful message go listen to the
[39:57] junction of time brother brown preachers
[40:00] hallelujah amen

[40:06] than three weeks ago to see that mighty
[40:08] one standing there who stood
[40:10] since i was a little boy and talked i'm
[40:11] not a fanatic
[40:13] you know that but it's to fulfill the
[40:14] scriptures i think this church ought to
[40:17] know
[40:17] truth and the sign where we're at that

[40:21] want to be slothful that you'll be up

[40:25] know the differences will be settled and
[40:27] you'll walk like real godly men and
[40:29] women
[40:30] our hearts sit on christ and don't look
[40:32] into these
[40:33] paltry things of the earth because it's
[40:35] of the devil
[40:36] all these quarrels and wars and strifes
[40:39] and different look away from them we're
[40:40] at the end
[40:41] and remember we may not have another
[40:44] week to do it in
[40:45] i don't know only god knows we're here
[40:47] at the end
[40:48] there was noah in his time here's israel
[40:51] in their time here's abraham at the next
[40:53] junction
[40:54] between the world and the natural and
[40:57] the supernatural
[40:58] he had visitation god would visit him
[40:59] regularly
[41:01] hallelujah on his walk with god god
[41:04] would visit him
[41:05] and he'd have conferences with his son
[41:07] and he began to tell him things and
[41:09] you know begin to make the promise more
[41:10] real to him isn't it the same thing with
[41:13] you and i
[41:14] where the word just becomes more alive
[41:16] and more alive and more real hallelujah
[41:18] it's no longer an abstract idea but it's
[41:20] more of a reality
[41:22] hallelujah and we know ultimately
[41:24] abraham's body got changed
[41:27] hallelujah the next junction between the
[41:29] world the natural and the supernatural
[41:31] angels came down that looked like men
[41:33] glory
[41:34] and stood by abraham the prophet told
[41:36] him abraham
[41:37] god will perform the supernatural about
[41:39] this time next year according to life

[41:44] forth a child

[42:03] trying to tell us tonight i'll show you
[42:05] my power bright
[42:06] how am i going to change your bodies in
[42:08] a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[42:10] hallelujah take you from this world to
[42:11] the next
[42:13] amen the evil spirits were down in sodom
[42:16] yes they're working among the world down
[42:18] here
[42:18] down there they're working here today
[42:21] gaity glamour and crack wall jokes and
[42:23] all the dirty things on radio television
[42:26] not even censored or nothing else and
[42:28] perverting sometimes the gospel to a
[42:30] social affair
[42:31] the whole world has become perverted but
[42:33] at the same time the world has become
[42:35] perverted the believers have become
[42:37] converted
[42:38] in the lord and the power of god by the
[42:40] working and appearing of omnipotence
[42:43] how that god and his mercy is showing
[42:45] forth these things
[42:47] hallelujah so we're going to recognize
[42:48] you know we're at a special time
[42:50] remember it's god's doing that's not the
[42:53] believers doing
[42:54] it's god's doing i mean just like we
[42:56] read that opening scripture in ephesians
[42:58] where he broke down that middle wall of
[43:00] partition you know since
[43:02] since since the you know since adam and
[43:04] eve were kicked out of the garden man
[43:06] was calling on the name of the lord when
[43:08] shall you restore
[43:09] as i said in the beginning it's not it's
[43:12] not necessary when we call it's when god
[43:14] does something
[43:15] hallelujah when he begins to reach down
[43:17] and deal with people
[43:18] i mean that's a supernatural thing amen
[43:20] that god would god would bridge that
[43:22] great chasm what a great chasm that was
[43:24] when when adam and eve
[43:26] fell you know they're walking in perfect
[43:28] faith before the fall there's never a
[43:29] problem never require never a sickness
[43:31] never a bad day
[43:33] amen never a demon oppressing them never
[43:35] trouble never sickness never death
[43:37] and god would just walk with them in
[43:38] perfect unity but then sin made such a
[43:41] great big chasm
[43:42] amen that that adam could only walk with
[43:44] a memory of what it was like to be a god
[43:46] over the earth
[43:48] hallelujah and then he would be in that
[43:49] kind of way and that call upon god god
[43:51] when will you restore these things
[43:53] this great big chasm and you know god
[43:55] would allow the blood of bulls and goats
[43:57] to kind of
[43:58] kind of you know bridge that chasm to a
[44:00] certain degree but it wasn't the same as
[44:02] in the garden
[44:03] but then when the blood of jesus christ
[44:05] came our prophet tells us that he didn't
[44:06] just bridge the chasm
[44:08] he took the chasm away hallelujah
[44:10] there's no longer a chasm the chasm's
[44:12] gone amen if the blood of jesus christ
[44:14] has
[44:15] fallen upon you change your soul i have
[44:17] brought you to a birth
[44:18] amen there's no more chasm between you
[44:20] and god it's done away with
[44:23] hallelujah it's gone there's no chasm
[44:24] there's no it's not there
[44:27] hallelujah imagine standing i've never
[44:29] been to the grand canyon but i imagine
[44:30] it'd be quite a sight but imagine
[44:31] standing at the grand canyon
[44:33] how do you get across then someone comes
[44:35] along and just pours the
[44:37] right amount of dirt in the whole thing
[44:39] and it's flat and you can just walk
[44:40] right across
[44:42] hallelujah that's kind of what the
[44:43] blood's done amen that
[44:46] that that grand canyon that that that
[44:47] sin created it's gone
[44:50] it's gone amen the blood puts us back on
[44:53] speaking terms with our father
[44:54] with our bridegroom hallelujah
[44:59] amen so man would call out when when
[45:01] will you restore these things and under
[45:03] the blood of bulls and goats
[45:04] sin was just covered it wasn't
[45:06] annihilated but then when the blood of
[45:08] jesus christ came amen
[45:09] brother brahm says it's like a bleach
[45:11] i'd sin is like a but
[45:13] yeah a bit of bank you drop into the
[45:14] bleach you can't find that you can't
[45:16] find that ink no more it's gone
[45:18] it's the same thing with with confessed
[45:19] sin when it's confessed
[45:21] sincerely amen from a repentant heart
[45:24] amen it's like it drops into the blood
[45:25] of jesus christ and it's gone and god
[45:27] don't remember it no more
[45:28] hallelujah so now one time we're on the
[45:30] wrong side of the chasm but now the
[45:32] chasm's gone
[45:33] remember it's god that reaches we
[45:36] weren't looking for him he was looking
[45:37] for you
[45:38] hallelujah he's looking for you heaven
[45:40] was reaching through
[45:41] where's my son where's my daughter i'm
[45:44] gonna find him and he did
[45:46] he doesn't he doesn't say it's too hard
[45:48] to find them he knows where we are
[45:50] hallelujah he knows where you are even
[45:52] tonight he knows where you are
[45:55] hallelujah amen so now
[45:59] now the believer is on the the chasm's
[46:01] gone
[46:03] and now heaven and earth can be united
[46:05] once again amen
[46:06] adam's fallen race in heaven are united
[46:08] once again
[46:10] you say oh but we need to be in a
[46:11] millennium to have that kind of
[46:12] fellowship with god
[46:14] oh no oh no right now
[46:17] remember god is proving to the devil it
[46:19] doesn't matter what you did in the
[46:20] beginning
[46:21] amen i'm gonna have perfect fellowship
[46:23] with my children
[46:24] even though they're in fallen bodies i
[46:26] will still walk with them like i want to
[46:28] walk with them
[46:29] amen there is no hindrance now the
[46:30] moving of the holy ghost
[46:32] oh there's no hindrance no more i mean
[46:35] there's no creeds there's no dogmas
[46:36] there's no trouble there's no hardship
[46:38] there's nothing that can stop them
[46:39] moving
[46:40] amen but if we just all we got to do is
[46:42] just stay surrendered yielded vessel
[46:45] hallelujah so because sometimes we say
[46:47] well i feel so far away from god and
[46:50] he's right there
[46:51] hallelujah he seems so far away he's
[46:54] right there
[46:55] remember we're not going to go on a
[46:56] rapture because we feel it
[46:59] hallelujah it's because we believe it
[47:01] remember faith goes beyond feeling
[47:04] amen your faith brings feeling but
[47:05] feeling is not necessarily faith
[47:08] or oh you're feeling down well that's
[47:09] fine it'll pass
[47:11] hallelujah it doesn't it doesn't unseal
[47:13] you doesn't take away your salvation
[47:16] amen but we're at a dispensational
[47:20] change now
[47:22] where god would where where heaven would
[47:24] expand once again
[47:26] hallelujah through the dark ages it's
[47:28] like it kind of withdrew and away even
[47:30] though god was
[47:31] present upon the earth but not in the
[47:32] magnitude that he was with the first
[47:35] church
[47:35] but now he's restored again hallelujah
[47:38] what was the you know
[47:40] brother brahms testimony that went round
[47:41] the world an angel met this man
[47:44] he had a visitation of an angel and he
[47:46] didn't just say it visit him in a cave
[47:48] it would come night after night meeting
[47:49] after meeting at the platform hallelujah
[47:52] as i you know
[47:53] uh you know as i shared after we came
[47:55] back from south africa
[47:56] you know brother brother willie rateef
[47:59] who who drove brother brown round
[48:01] in the johannesburg area he said when
[48:03] that presence came down
[48:04] and he got tears in his eyes he said if
[48:07] people ever stood in that presence they
[48:08] would never doubt this message
[48:10] and then when we went down to cape town
[48:12] and we were standing outside the drill
[48:13] hall by the town hall in cape town there
[48:16] if anyone's ever who's been there
[48:18] and there's a castle of good hope right
[48:20] over there there's that big open area
[48:21] and brother dale adams stood and he told
[48:23] us how there was a woman she was a young
[48:25] just a teenager there when brother brown
[48:27] was preaching there and
[48:28] and all she remembers him saying after
[48:30] people were preaching all day
[48:32] and she couldn't get in the hall where
[48:33] the prophet was preaching she was
[48:35] outside with thousands of people
[48:36] and she couldn't you know all she
[48:38] remembers brother i'm saying was good
[48:40] evening friends
[48:41] and after he said that the she said the
[48:43] anointing fell on the whole
[48:44] whole crowd and people just were
[48:46] supernaturally healed spontaneously
[48:49] what a visitation you say if only i
[48:52] lived back in that day no the same god
[48:54] is here
[48:55] the same god is present i mean that same
[48:57] jesus is here
[48:59] we don't have to go back in time or
[49:01] listen to a tape and say i wish i was
[49:02] back in that kind of meeting no you
[49:04] could have that kind of meaning right
[49:05] now
[49:06] you could walk with that god right now
[49:07] hallelujah amen because the prophet's
[49:10] ministry was to show us that jesus
[49:11] christ is the same
[49:13] yesterday today and forever right it was
[49:16] to demonstrate
[49:17] this is what the power of the blood does
[49:20] that's what god showed
[49:21] this is what my cross is to achieve that
[49:23] a man would stand
[49:25] as a redeemed son and take every spirit
[49:28] under his control for the glory of god
[49:30] and nothing could stand before his
[49:31] prayers not even cancer
[49:34] hallelujah no sickness no devil nothing
[49:37] all of it had to bow his feet because he
[49:38] was a redeemed son
[49:40] washed in the blood of the lamb oh
[49:42] that's the prophet what about the bride
[49:44] what about a people that are redeemed by
[49:46] the same blood that have the same holy
[49:48] ghost
[49:49] hallelujah amen so angels would visit
[49:55] hallelujah we say well that's that's
[49:57] that's back then
[49:58] you can have visitation of angels in
[50:00] your home
[50:02] that's right you can have you can have
[50:03] angels come visit your home
[50:05] you can have the lord walk through your
[50:06] front door he doesn't need to open he
[50:08] just walks through it
[50:10] i don't mean that as a joke but he can
[50:11] step in there his present can step into
[50:13] your home
[50:14] i remember when brother john anders was
[50:15] preaching that first youth without
[50:17] borders the third one's coming up by the
[50:18] way
[50:19] watch it register be part of it
[50:23] and and he would say you know you can
[50:25] invite the angel lord into your house
[50:28] and and he was giving testimony brother
[50:30] brown said that a couple of
[50:32] women who who knew each other
[50:33] neighborhood one had a big goat had the
[50:35] other one had something else i can't
[50:36] remember
[50:37] and they came up and got prayed for by
[50:39] the prophet
[50:40] and and he just told them no you just go
[50:42] keep believing i think about a month
[50:44] after that
[50:45] the angel lord visited their
[50:46] neighborhood and and one of them who
[50:49] couldn't eat
[50:50] anything really at all she just eaten
[50:51] just throw up and lots of ass and stuff
[50:54] come out and things
[50:55] she just felt something just just like a
[50:56] cool also or hot feeling just come over
[50:59] her
[50:59] she got hungry who knows the story yeah
[51:02] and then and then and then she begins to
[51:04] eat
[51:04] eats the children's leftover breakfast
[51:06] or that set really well
[51:07] then she made pancakes whatever coffee
[51:09] just ate you know and realized there's
[51:11] nothing wrong with me
[51:12] and she runs down to where her neighbor
[51:13] was and she found her neighbor shaking
[51:16] the sheets out trying to find something
[51:18] and she said it's left my body i know
[51:21] tumor or whatever it was and what
[51:23] happened the angel lord visited
[51:24] her and then visited her friend and then
[51:27] he said you can have that same kind of
[51:29] visitation
[51:30] so what did we do we said lord jesus
[51:32] come to 138 george street stokes valley
[51:34] please
[51:35] holy and the prince of god came down
[51:37] into the house hallelujah
[51:39] we can still have visitation amen
[51:41] hallelujah why because that's what our
[51:43] god loves to do he loves to visit his
[51:44] children
[51:46] hallelujah amen
[51:51] hallelujah now
[51:55] the unseen is influencing
[51:59] the scene realm right
[52:04] now jesus would say in john 14
[52:08] if you want to put that up john john 14
[52:10] 1
[52:15] john 14 1.
[52:18] do not let your hearts be troubled you
[52:21] believe in god believe also in me
[52:23] in my father's house of many mansions
[52:25] keep going
[52:27] next yeah in my father's house no can we
[52:29] go back
[52:30] go back to two in my father's house are
[52:33] many mansions if we're not so i would
[52:35] have told you
[52:36] i did i go to prepare a place for you
[52:38] next verse
[52:40] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[52:41] i will come again
[52:43] i'll come again and we'll receive you
[52:45] unto myself that where i
[52:47] am there you may be also right
[52:50] so he's saying i'm gonna go prepare a
[52:52] place and if i do i'm gonna come get you
[52:54] that where i am you'll be also now we
[52:57] know his body
[52:59] is up in heaven right his spirit's upon
[53:02] the earth
[53:02] but his body is up in heaven right
[53:05] and when the when the living and the
[53:07] dead saints are translated to that next
[53:09] dimension we're going to meet them
[53:11] halfway
[53:12] right we're going to meet the lord in
[53:13] the air right but right now
[53:15] the spirit lord is upon the earth to
[53:18] fulfill that scripture
[53:19] that where i am not where you are not
[53:22] not in these five senses not in this
[53:23] dimension
[53:24] but in that other dimension where i am
[53:27] you will be also
[53:28] i will i mean can you put that back oh
[53:32] i'll just turn to it
[53:34] he says he says and he says i will go
[53:37] and prepare a place for you verse 3
[53:39] i will come again and receive you unto
[53:41] myself
[53:42] that where i am there you may be also
[53:45] she says i'm going to basically reach
[53:46] down into this realm
[53:48] i'm going to get a hold of you and i'm
[53:50] going to pull you into that next realm
[53:51] hallelujah remember it's not us trying
[53:53] to step into that dimension it's god
[53:55] reaching through
[53:56] and i wish i could demonstrate it better
[53:58] than this by the from the unseen into
[54:00] the scene
[54:01] i'm going to get a hold of your lives
[54:02] hallelujah i'm going to i'm going to
[54:04] guide you by my voice hallelujah and
[54:06] you're going to walk with me
[54:07] and there's going to come a time where
[54:09] you will be not because i've taken you
[54:12] hallelujah that's a promise amen and and
[54:15] this is what we're looking at here in
[54:16] this part of
[54:17] part of redemption because remember
[54:19] jesus purchased our salvation on calvary
[54:21] but then he's got to come and claim
[54:23] hallelujah what he purchased amen
[54:25] and we know this is symbolized in
[54:27] revelations 4 and 5 of the taking of the
[54:29] book
[54:30] amen so now here so so here we are
[54:34] and this is why it's so amazing remember
[54:36] this is not a teaching this has got to
[54:38] be experienced
[54:40] where heaven comes and touches you
[54:45] where the unseen touches you
[54:48] because you think about what what made
[54:50] us become believers
[54:52] it wasn't our mental state it wasn't our
[54:55] five senses
[54:56] it wasn't it because it it wasn't
[54:58] because it sounded reasonable
[54:59] it wasn't because it was a good idea at
[55:01] the time we had a lot of good ideas at
[55:03] the time but they're always bad
[55:05] you know it wasn't because of that it
[55:06] knows because god reached through
[55:09] and got a hold of you and turned your
[55:11] heart around
[55:12] when you weren't looking for him he
[55:14] found you yes sir
[55:15] hallelujah what's happening it's
[55:17] actually eternity
[55:19] bumping into you brother brown uses this
[55:22] term bumping
[55:23] he says he says now the only thing you
[55:26] do when you die you just change those
[55:28] five senses
[55:30] you just receive another sense and
[55:31] you're alive with a higher sense
[55:33] thousands of times higher than this in
[55:35] another life
[55:36] a life where there's no death where
[55:38] there's no sorrow
[55:39] and the things that you don't know
[55:41] nothing about now
[55:43] nothing about now sorry
[55:47] i can read and you're alive with higher
[55:51] senses thousands of times higher than
[55:52] this
[55:53] in another life a life where there's no
[55:55] death where there's no sorrow and the
[55:56] things that you don't know nothing about
[55:58] now you see it plainly
[56:00] when you cross there you don't
[56:02] understand it now because you're bumping
[56:04] into it
[56:05] you haven't got that sense as you say i
[56:07] feel a strange feeling here tonight
[56:09] looks to me like i just want to cry or
[56:11] shout or something
[56:12] it's the angels of the lord see that's
[56:16] what makes us feel that way
[56:17] it's not our own excitement it's not our
[56:19] own you know happiness
[56:21] it's god it's the angels of the lord
[56:23] bumping into you
[56:25] hallelujah remember the reason he says
[56:27] that i i will come again and receive you
[56:29] unto myself he says
[56:31] i go to prepare a place for you
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:34] so already now now brother brown tells
[56:36] us and things that are to be he's not
[56:38] talking about a physical building
[56:40] like like wood and stone and stuff right
[56:42] he's talking about bodies
[56:44] he's talking about bodies and we know in
[56:46] an eternal realm we have one waiting in
[56:48] the heaven
[56:49] right so the reason that heaven bumps
[56:51] into you right is because you have a
[56:53] body to step
[56:53] into hallelujah and it's going to come a
[56:56] time
[56:57] where it just bumps into you your
[56:58] eternity whatever the camp eternity
[57:00] bumped into us
[57:02] hallelujah and i pray even tonight
[57:03] eternity's bumping into you
[57:05] making your heart be stirred hallelujah
[57:07] and yo awakening you to the reality
[57:10] we're not in this battle alone
[57:12] hallelujah but there'll come a timer is
[57:13] just bumping
[57:15] bumping and then finally it'll slow down
[57:17] we'll speed up it
[57:19] won't be just be a bumpy it's going to
[57:20] carry us away
[57:22] hallelujah yes sir hallelujah that's
[57:25] right that's exactly what's going to
[57:26] happen
[57:28] hallelujah it just won't just be a
[57:29] one-off thing it's going to be closer
[57:31] and closer then boom and we're gone
[57:34] hallelujah certainly he lives there's
[57:38] brother brown again what's this but
[57:39] what's this you're bumping into all the
[57:41] time
[57:43] what's that condemns you when you're
[57:45] wrong what's that that makes you believe
[57:48] that's him he says you might not be able
[57:50] to open your eyes and see him because
[57:52] he's in spirit form
[57:54] the invisible god but he dwells among
[57:56] invisible people
[57:57] making himself visible by his promised
[58:00] word in that people
[58:01] do you understand that now yes
[58:04] hallelujah
[58:06] you know he would he would give the
[58:07] analogy it's like a blind man
[58:09] who goes out into the under under the
[58:12] sun
[58:13] and he's never seen the sun before he's
[58:14] blind never seen it before
[58:16] but he feels the sun rays and especially
[58:18] in this country you feel it really good
[58:20] because the ozone layer is
[58:22] gone or something you know thank you
[58:24] other nations for those
[58:26] anyway you know you can feel the sun
[58:28] rise that bites you
[58:29] yeah i trust you go outside sometimes
[58:32] you know a lot of time i'm at work you
[58:35] know in a
[58:36] lab gown in a sealed lab i just look out
[58:39] and see the sunshine
[58:40] looks kind of nice and then you walk out
[58:42] the front door and it's raining you
[58:43] think how did this happen
[58:45] but anyway you know oh boy but you know
[58:49] it's there but if i walked outside i'd
[58:51] feel the rays of the sun
[58:53] amen he says it's like a blind man that
[58:55] you know never felt the sun before be
[58:57] but but if he went outside he'd say it's
[58:59] out of someone who can see
[59:00] i feel this all over me but i don't know
[59:02] what it is what's causing this
[59:04] what's making me feel this way what's
[59:06] making me feel this way
[59:08] and the person who could see well say
[59:09] that's the sun
[59:11] that's the sun and then and then maybe
[59:13] he'd try to describe it yes like a ball
[59:15] of fire in the sky
[59:17] and it comes up at a certain time goes
[59:18] down at a certain time
[59:20] and it gives life to the earth and you
[59:21] know you're trying to explain it that
[59:22] way
[59:23] and he says it's the same thing with god
[59:26] amen those like the prophet he'd say
[59:28] can't you see that light hanging over
[59:29] that person
[59:30] not everyone could see it but they could
[59:32] feel his presence
[59:34] hallelujah and just like god you know we
[59:37] may not see the pillar of fire
[59:39] but we feel the rays of the of the son
[59:42] light
[59:42] i mean we feel his presence oh just like
[59:45] when we were at camp and god came down
[59:46] in a powerful way or when we have
[59:48] services here
[59:49] what's happened god steps into the room
[59:52] holy the pillar of fire comes into the
[59:53] room amen that same one that moses met
[59:56] same one that paul met hardly the same
[59:58] one that the prophet meant i mean the
[59:59] very same god of the bible
[1:00:01] steps into the room hallelujah we may
[1:00:03] not see him here but we feel his race
[1:00:06] amen we feel the sunlight hallelujah
[1:00:11] hallelujah amen i'm so thankful it's
[1:00:14] that way
[1:00:16] that we feel his presence what is it
[1:00:18] eternity bumping into you
[1:00:21] ever been bumped into by something oh
[1:00:23] what was that
[1:00:24] hallelujah and sometimes you say why do
[1:00:26] i feel this way
[1:00:30] are we people who anyone who's
[1:00:34] emotionally detached i can see you in
[1:00:35] the office we can pray
[1:00:37] we can talk about these things but you
[1:00:39] know what makes us feel this way it's
[1:00:41] god
[1:00:43] it's god in this in this junction of
[1:00:44] time hallelujah we're
[1:00:46] you know we just go back even just over
[1:00:48] a hundred years ago before the azusa
[1:00:50] street move
[1:00:51] there wasn't a lot of supernatural going
[1:00:54] on
[1:00:55] but it was great proliferation of gifts
[1:00:57] and you know the manifestations of the
[1:00:58] spirit why
[1:00:59] because god was going to bring his
[1:01:00] second part of redemption
[1:01:02] hallelujah as the same thing even now
[1:01:04] i'd say there's still
[1:01:06] god still lives right we don't have to
[1:01:09] be historians
[1:01:10] wishing we live back there the same god
[1:01:12] lives now
[1:01:13] how the same god does the same things
[1:01:15] now i say
[1:01:17] an even a greater measure hallelujah
[1:01:21] is it not is it we get anointed by the
[1:01:23] spirit you know some people are afraid
[1:01:25] of the anointing
[1:01:27] and i'll just say this i heard i think
[1:01:28] it was brother tim pruitt said i think
[1:01:30] he can stand quoting
[1:01:31] you know the anointing is just like the
[1:01:34] rain
[1:01:35] the rain isn't made for the weeds
[1:01:39] right it's not made for the tears it's
[1:01:40] made for the wheat
[1:01:42] right the anointing is made for the
[1:01:44] children of god
[1:01:45] it doesn't matter what other people do
[1:01:47] with it it doesn't discount it's made
[1:01:48] for us
[1:01:49] hallelujah the anointing is for the
[1:01:51] bride i mean to bring us
[1:01:53] that the word will be manifested in our
[1:01:55] lives in a greater portion amen
[1:01:58] hallelujah so we shouldn't be afraid of
[1:02:00] the anointing we should expect it
[1:02:02] we should be living for it that god
[1:02:04] would take this word and make it live in
[1:02:06] our lives
[1:02:08] hallelujah amen so here we are
[1:02:13] the angels of god are in this room
[1:02:16] god is present he says with two or three
[1:02:19] gathered in my name there i am in the
[1:02:20] midst
[1:02:21] yes hallelujah that we're not alone in
[1:02:23] this battle
[1:02:24] you know we may think the world well the
[1:02:26] world is falling apart but we don't need
[1:02:27] to get worried about it
[1:02:28] we don't do we need to get stressed
[1:02:30] about it i mean because it says as as
[1:02:33] daniel michael the great prince will
[1:02:35] stand up
[1:02:36] for thy people in this day in a time of
[1:02:38] trouble
[1:02:39] amen you know many times we will look
[1:02:42] and we will say well the world is just
[1:02:43] basically it's hell upon the earth
[1:02:45] and we know based from revelations 9
[1:02:47] that hell has emptied itself upon the
[1:02:49] earth
[1:02:50] right everything even even little
[1:02:51] children's toys have been designed to
[1:02:53] desensitize people to demon possession
[1:02:56] right you even take lego these days
[1:02:59] who's in the lego where you get your
[1:03:00] phone and it's um augmented reality and
[1:03:02] you can catch ghosts
[1:03:04] it's all it's it's conditioning people
[1:03:07] and skulls and death and everything it's
[1:03:09] all black and zombies and all this stuff
[1:03:11] what is it it's the conditioner
[1:03:12] generation to
[1:03:14] that they get used to demons running
[1:03:16] rampant
[1:03:18] yeah and we can say oh isn't that a
[1:03:19] horrible thing it is a horrible thing
[1:03:21] but then the thing is when john saw the
[1:03:23] bottomless pit open
[1:03:25] he says in revelations 10 and 1 and i
[1:03:27] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:03:29] heaven
[1:03:30] i mean so he saw hell come up but heaven
[1:03:32] come down
[1:03:33] hallelujah so now we must understand
[1:03:35] that now that is christ in
[1:03:37] angelic form right in a rainbow about
[1:03:39] his head is a covenant angel that that
[1:03:41] is christ
[1:03:42] hallelujah so now now when hell opens up
[1:03:44] now so there's a dimension merging with
[1:03:46] this one
[1:03:47] right there's also heaven coming down
[1:03:50] and merging with this dimension
[1:03:52] i mean so we're not alone in this battle
[1:03:54] i mean but the mighty angel himself has
[1:03:56] come down into the end time
[1:03:58] hallelujah and he's putting his foot on
[1:04:00] the sea in the land where those demon
[1:04:02] powers come
[1:04:02] up and he's holding them at bay
[1:04:04] hallelujah until his bride gets into her
[1:04:07] position
[1:04:08] that she takes the book eats the book
[1:04:10] and prophesies again
[1:04:12] hallelujah so we don't need to worry
[1:04:14] about anything really
[1:04:15] amen because our god is in control
[1:04:19] hallelujah you say well i'm just
[1:04:21] fumbling through life no no
[1:04:22] eternity's bumping into you amen it is
[1:04:25] bumping into you
[1:04:26] guiding you how do you say what caused
[1:04:28] me to be a believer eternity bumped into
[1:04:30] you
[1:04:31] it wasn't you saying i'm going to try
[1:04:33] again eternity bumped into you
[1:04:35] i mean when you wanted to quit eternity
[1:04:37] said no you're not going to quit
[1:04:39] our lord jesus says you ain't quitting
[1:04:40] boy you're getting up you're gonna keep
[1:04:42] walking
[1:04:43] hallelujah you know brother james and
[1:04:45] sorry brother james if you're watching
[1:04:47] but he wanted to preach tonight about
[1:04:48] don't give up
[1:04:50] we shouldn't give up maybe i'll leave
[1:04:52] that for him
[1:04:54] but let's not give up well you know
[1:04:58] it seems like there's such a yeah like
[1:05:00] the veil between this world mix is
[1:05:02] getting so
[1:05:02] thin hallelujah it's getting so
[1:05:06] thin so don't give up
[1:05:09] god's here to fight our battles he's
[1:05:12] here to look after us
[1:05:13] and we should expect visitations of
[1:05:16] angels
[1:05:17] well how do you know they're real angels
[1:05:19] you know a devil is just a fallen angel
[1:05:22] all the angels had a choice will they
[1:05:24] listen to what lucifer says or
[1:05:26] they listen to god they actually were
[1:05:28] put on free moral agency to choose
[1:05:32] right and some of them list decided to
[1:05:35] choose lucifer
[1:05:36] as their king and they fell right and
[1:05:39] some said no we're not going to listen
[1:05:40] to the devil's lie and they remained
[1:05:42] right i mean so now at an angel that's
[1:05:45] fallen becomes a demon

[1:05:54] suicidal thoughts just a fallen angel
[1:05:57] hatred is just a fallen angel right it's
[1:06:00] just
[1:06:00] fallen angels trying to influence a sane
[1:06:03] world

[1:06:07] and as you say people get so moody and
[1:06:09] angry and do
[1:06:10] you know they want to withdraw
[1:06:11] themselves and you know what is that
[1:06:13] that's a demon inspiration trying to
[1:06:16] trying to ward off someone
[1:06:18] i wouldn't listen to that kind of stuff
[1:06:20] i'd say satan get behind me
[1:06:22] you may want to feel like you want to
[1:06:23] end it all you better feel like you just
[1:06:24] want to quit
[1:06:25] that's the devil trying to anointing
[1:06:27] your feelings but i just denied in the
[1:06:29] name of jesus christ saying satan
[1:06:31] eternity's bumped into me and you're too
[1:06:32] late and i am not making the same choice
[1:06:35] you may
[1:06:36] you made a choice are you going to stand
[1:06:38] against god i'm not making your choice
[1:06:40] i've picked a side you've picked a side
[1:06:42] and that's it
[1:06:44] hallelujah amen brother brown says i
[1:06:48] think it is
[1:06:48] and who is this melchizedek he says then
[1:06:51] after
[1:06:52] he recognized the very word of god was
[1:06:55] eagle food
[1:06:56] then you left the other thing you have
[1:06:59] been formed
[1:07:00] into the living image of the living god
[1:07:02] you heard from your theophany
[1:07:05] if this earthly body be dissolved we
[1:07:07] have one waiting
[1:07:09] i mean so when the work when this
[1:07:10] message comes alive to you
[1:07:12] more than doctrine more than a nice idea
[1:07:15] it becomes a living reality
[1:07:17] what's happened you've heard from your
[1:07:18] theophany i don't know why i'm doing
[1:07:20] this it's just punched the devil a few
[1:07:22] times
[1:07:23] hallelujah but we've heard from our
[1:07:25] theophany so now
[1:07:26] so if this is quicker than me if this
[1:07:28] word is quick in me
[1:07:30] what's god telling me i have a body
[1:07:33] it's it's there amen i don't know it's
[1:07:36] maybe this size maybe not you know what
[1:07:38] i mean but
[1:07:38] i have i have a body waiting in the
[1:07:41] heavens
[1:07:42] and this message is to line me up with
[1:07:44] my theophany
[1:07:45] i mean so as we walk with god we become
[1:07:47] more the spirit man
[1:07:50] becomes more like that image and
[1:07:52] there'll come a time where the image in
[1:07:53] me
[1:07:54] will match that image and they'll merge
[1:07:56] together
[1:07:58] hallelujah and this is where we're
[1:07:59] walking you know i think it was brother
[1:08:00] freddie said
[1:08:01] you know about the holy ghost in us it's
[1:08:03] not a little button no more
[1:08:06] hallelujah do you remember camp who
[1:08:07] remembers camp he made a statement
[1:08:11] he said he said we know when the holy
[1:08:12] ghost comes in brother it says like a
[1:08:14] small button the size of a white button
[1:08:16] he says it's not that size anymore it's
[1:08:18] grown up
[1:08:19] it's pushed out harley pushed out the
[1:08:22] malice and the strife and the envy and
[1:08:23] the unforgiveness and the bitterness and
[1:08:25] the gospel and the whatever
[1:08:26] and the and the and the flesh you know
[1:08:28] it's all been pushed out
[1:08:30] so i said now now it's not a little bit
[1:08:32] no more

[1:08:35] eternal representation
[1:08:37] hallelujah this is where we are
[1:08:40] hallelujah
[1:08:42] so there's going to come a time and it'd
[1:08:44] be quite cool if i didn't have to walk
