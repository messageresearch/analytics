everything you grant to us Lord and our time here on earth Lord and we are truly thankful for for that Lord Jesus thank you that you love us lord thank you that you died for us on the cross Lord but thank you Lord that you are living in your hearts and you are living and reigning Lord Jesus and that we're going to be in heaven with you soon Lord Lord we ask that you will bless the service bless

stay Lord Jesus and and we give you all the present on our Jesus name you mean you may have your seats we're going to start with some housekeeping this morning come in if you would mind to come across and then once we're done with that we'll get into the worship I'm afraid amen good morning Church it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning I can see the smiles on your faces I can see that you know all our kayne expecting this morning so yep there's lots in store for us this morning and I believe that with all my heart there's a few housekeeping rules that we want to take care of firstly this morning we've got new families in the church so we need to put this in place firstly for the fire exits in this place as we come in is a first exit or first entry and exit and the second one is the kitchen doors to your right there's a key on the door unlock the staircase going down and we assemble just on the side there's a carpark anyway I just on the side of the building downstairs do not cross the road so all kids if you're going out with mom and dad or you're running out before that please assemble down at the carpark and do not cross the road everyone will be accounted for afterwards and we will let you know when the place is safe if in case of emergency so yes there's a few things that we want to bring to bring delight we've worked with the Sunday School teachers last week and we set out the classes and for the armaan would have sent your messages as to who's in whose class and where our kids for fallen we changed from four classrooms to three so it's the three classrooms on our on our left and the names are all been given out as the lambs the Lions and the Eagles kids the classrooms I'd be set by the teachers and also spoken to the appearance so enjoy these classes make the best of it our brothers and sisters as the teachers in the classroom do a great job and we just want to thank each one of them the teachers also we want to thank thank the teachers that were there last year they did a great job there as well and we know that the Lord is using the gifts in our church each one with a young or old big or small each one's got a place to play or a part to play with in this church group and we're just thankful for that be it a musician be it a song lead or beat anyone even like David sitting in the back learning how to do the overhead it's wonderful to see how the Lord moves you know whether I'm the person playing that little triangle at the back thing just at the end of the song but I'm they all right so just think of yourself the same all right well it's a little triangle or with it's the song leading enjoy yourself be free in the spirit lift let the Lord work with you right so our gifts need to come out not only in the church but outside as well with our families with our friends without work colleagues so use that what the Lord has given you few things that we need to bring to light the church is a special holy sanctuary we want to try to keep it that way yes we are getting bigger big in numbers greater numbers but this is the space that we got to work with so please work with us as a church we want to keep the place holy and clean and quiet especially within the service after the service when parents or younger ones are praying and and and talking to God and if the past days praying for people in front try to keep our kids quiet moms and dads assist the other parents that are out in front getting prayer assist with their kids support sisters and brothers that are getting prayed for kids close your eyes be quiet at that time just let us humble ourselves while the play is carrying on it's very important that we have a breakthrough we enter in so please if our kids are the ones that need to be spoken to parents speak to our kids we love them dearly we want them not to lose that opportunity to be in the Lord's presence so each kid if you can close your eyes while mommy they are praying that will be really grateful I know y'all can do it because you'll do it in the sunday-school class and you're not wonderful and we'll love each one and each one learns from each other so we just want to bring these House Rules out the instruments in front for our song leaders and our worship team in front this instruments are really costly so parents if you'll see your kids come out to the front to touch the instruments or play with the instruments please refrain from that we don't want that we got instruments that stay in the church at all times our brothers and sisters have brought these instruments to the church some the church head as their instruments from the church but please respect that do not touch the instruments even after the church service or even only having a get together here in the church hold please do not touch the instruments I'm very guilty of the next one and I put my hand up first brothers and sisters we love each other we share with each other we bring stuff to the church to hand over to another brother to bless another sister to bless the kids can we get all those blessings done outside church we don't want clothes passed around food pass around or anything brought into the sanctuary that's supposed to be outside so if we want to bless another brother and sister please do that outside the church or after the church service we don't want to bring stuff into the church and leave it to the back for someone and they don't pick it up and then it builds up and builds up we got lots of things that we have to get rid of in the church and it's the people that are cleaning the church or putting up with this and packing it up and moving it around please refrain from that the kitchen facility out the back and the toilets out the back use it respect it anyone using the facilities please respect the facilities if the facilities are not clean when you come into church let me know please and we will address it the kitchen out the back used make sure you tidy up behind yourself same with the toilets parents when our kids are going to the toilets if you've seen one that wind and another one is going hold them back till one comes back sometimes the kids congregate at the back and we don't know what's happening at the back while we are worshiping so if you see one kid is going and your kid wants to go hold them back for a few seconds while the other one comes back so just allow the spirit to move and not to hinder it so when our kids gone to the back mom and dad are thinking where's the kids why are they in the back just we want to try to cut that away our space is getting confined we can only do so much in this space that we got but I'll just ask of you to respect at the house of the Lord thank you very much thank you alright now before you get up I just want to share something first this morning I wrote a song called take me home and we're gonna sing it as a congregation I'm not going to do it as a special because I think you guys are smart enough to pick it up quite quickly it's been shared it around a bit so some of you know it and all of that but I have a lot of strugglers in my life I know you guys are don't because you guys are so good but I have a lot of struggles and my ultimate prayer is that he takes me home and that is that is my prayer and and the chorus talks about you know take me home where the waters are sweet take me home where his fountains are deep with the storms fall asleep and but until then you know my prayer is that he builds my faith my hope my peace and my joy because those are the things that keep us going every day every day that's what keeps us going you know he's gave us his promises he gave us his word he gave us his blood you know we've been talking about these things so many times over the last month you know applying the blood you know understanding his word standing on his promises those are the things and and the fact that is in me you know and that's why I wrote the song is it's so that when I go through one of my mini struggles I would remember these things and we'll see it and and I'll sing it to you now we're going to sing it to you later I'll just do a verse a pre-chorus and the and the chorus and then now we'll get into there right [Music] Laure build my faith Lord build my faith in the word you have given for me to dead Lord build my faith or

have everyone here god bless you all if you'd like to turn with me into the scripture turn to John chapter 11 [Music] so you know when the everyone in the backs doing their job cuz he because it just happens you don't realize they're there I mean anyway we're gonna read this bit of a I want to take this from a different angle this is just from the from Jesus raising Lazarus from the from the dead and it says here Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the cave cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take away the stone marry the sister of him that was dead said unto Him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead for days jesus saith unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of God then he took away the stone from the place where they did then they took away the stone from the place where the deed was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people would stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes with so with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go amen may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats this morning now I want you to sorry sorry ok that's alright now I want to just so I want to speak on a subject just from the scripture it may seem a bit odd but I want to speak about subject of fulfill your scripture we have a word to fulfill you know we don't just sit by and you know you know God has linked his plan with men it is it is unseparable God works through man God has always worked through man and he is waiting on you you have a part to play in his plan of redemption you have a part to play and so there has to be sorry oh yeah so that's just the second part brother Bernie just say yeah so you can read it we have a part two we ever we have a scripture to fulfill amen we have a part to play and I'm going to show you in the scripture let's go to mark this is not on my notes I'm sorry but this has got a few Gospels before we'll go to will go to mark and me and the end of the Gospel of Mark I want to encourage you this morning fulfill your Scripture I mean we've got to work to live and we know it's him in us living it but we've got a scripture to fulfill Amen is a portion of the word that the bride has to manifest upon the earth so let's not you know I just encourage you this morning fulfill fulfill your scriptures I mean so he sees here in mark so I don't have this on the overhead but but the book of Mark chapter 16 and we'll read from verse 15 now do we I just want to make sure you're there hey there yep okay and he said unto the emphasis Jesus instructions there's after he he he's come out of the grave he's speaking to his disciples and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that belief so the believed of these signs shall follow them and my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and they went forth preaching everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following Amen so it says then the Lord went with them confirming the word so God tied himself into us into his church I've commissioned you gone to all the world preach the gospel wherever you find the devil cast them out I mean these signs will follow you you don't have to manufacture anything they'll follow you hallelujah is wherever you go there'll be signs and wonders Amen you don't you know and remember you don't have to go by well HEVs all these things manifested me they shall in their season maybe once or twice it doesn't matter but the signs will follow the believer but we believe first I mean we believe first signs do not lead us signs follow us you take you take King Saul King Saul Samuel told him you know you'll go here so you know and you'll find your donkeys and all these things signs lead King Saul but signs follow David I mean so I want to be like King David signs followed him I mean the anointing came upon him when he was a shepherd boy and in he and he killed the lion and he killed the bear and they killed Goliath the sign followed I'll conquer everything that comes against me hallelujah so that's the signs will follow them the belief and the devil is always put well it's even in my Bible here some of the old manuscripts they don't have this part well and then some people say it's well it's not inspired and I just say well if it's not inspired and it works how much more scripture that is it that is inspired it'll work a whole bunch more but it's all inspired to me hallelujah so God works with his people amen he sees this way are we back on now this is this is brother Bernie season and the cool of the evening he had come down so this is an Eden this is in the Garden of Eden and the cool of the evening he had come down and communion with him and there he lost and there he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it because it was a separation between God and man and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could he could come back again to man and live and man and restore a man to a stage of communion with him again remember this is men a woman he's talking about and give him back his god-given right that's what he did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost that's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plan to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you say me making me a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit giving you a spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam right now that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or to a woman when it strikes their into their heart and takes its abode there's a thirst and a hunger in for lost souls amen so he makes you a co-worker with him you have a part to play you got to fulfill your scriptures hallelujah amen no now I want to show you a couple of examples I've read there from mark but I want to show you this because I walk because people say well God will do it God will take care of everything you know and he will but he's relying on us he's relying on us prophecy has to be fulfilled and he uses men to fulfill his word so this is a classic example here is an ex chapter 10 Cornelius now you can read it if you want I'm not going to read it but this is this is Cornelius as a Gentile and he's been praying and and he's a believer but he doesn't know that G yet the Messiah is coming he's a believer in the Old Testament what we would call the Old Testament and he's praying and an angel appears to him and the angel doesn't preach him the gospel the angel doesn't tell him that the Messiah has come and he's been crucified and he took and he took your sins upon his shoulders went up Calvary descended into hell took the keys of held into the grave of Satan on high victorious now he's alive forevermore and he's put out a spirit upon all flesh the angel didn't say anything about it yeah you see it go get Peter because God always works through his body I mean and and that's the rest of the part he so the angel instruction go get Peter because Peter cuz God works through his body I mean and Peter was part of the body hallelujah so so the angel said I mean so Cornelius sent some men they went and got Peter Peter came to Cornelius house they had a service God came down filled the Gentiles hallelujah and and here we are today glory to God so God always uses men he always uses man now we have a num now I read that scripture about Lazarus being raised it's because you notice Jesus now he was the crater and flesh all God was the fullness of Godhead bodily then he was everything God is I mean it wasn't a portion of God in a man it was all God in a man so he created all things the crater built a body for redemption and dwelt in it I mean to bring us salvation now he could have walked to the tomb and he could have see it's don't move and the stone would have moved and then what he said Lazarus come forth and that it would have come forth and then he could have said grave clothes be gone and they would have been gone but he didn't do that he he so there were people there and he said move the stone away and someone maybe who's been strong enough that their entire life had been built for that moment God uses God use God trained John the Baptist for thirty years I mean he was 30 when he started his ministry he was about he was a child eight or nine history tells us when he went into the wilderness I mean and God trained him all that time teaching him revealing himself to him in the wilderness then he'd be used for six months God does these things God will God will train someone just for a little bit I mean I mean train them for a long time just to use them a little bit and that's their port that's the scripture they have to fulfill hallelujah and so now there are people there I don't know how big the stone was but maybe there are people there that was strong enough we know how to move the stone so God brought these gifts these gifts were there amen to fulfill the word hallelujah because without anyone moving the stone Lazarus could maybe be a lively stuck in a tomb God uses God uses our hands our feet our mouth our voices our hearts Amen he's looking for willing vessels that will there'll be full prisoners as we heard about on Wednesday I mean he can manifest himself through so so there are people there due to roll the stone away and they're now here and then he says Lazarus come forth he comes back to life but he's covered in these great clothes now he was all wrapped up and maybe there's someone there who knew how to unwrap a body so maybe they are taught and how the you know how the body's prepared and everything for burial and then so he says now you loose him and let him go he didn't loosen the people had to loose him are you following me so that said whoever loosed them took the grave clothes off and they had a part to play I mean for him to come out of the grave so the body not you know the body was working that this person would come back to life I mean and they would be free I mean from what bound then hallelujah it's the same thing well it's a body work it's not a one-man band hallelujah it's not a one-man band it's a body work and we all have our part to play and it doesn't matter if you you know it doesn't matter if you're the person just they just found the first part of the but to unravel or if you did all the hard work unraveling it or whatever it was as long as you depart to play that's the main thing is as brother kuben said amen praise God if I've got a triangle at the end of the song Tinh hallelujah as long as you're part of the symphony that's the main thing that's the main thing so we're going to fulfill our part you're gonna find your part and fulfill it and you'll begin to find yourself when God gets ahold of your life he'll begin to move you into that part even and even and maybe against your own reasoning he'll begin to move you a certain way and you and you'll find him living through and be so natural hallelujah he's moving you into your place now I want to go to Genesis Genesis chapter uh I'm sorry I don't have this in the overheads either this is chapter 15 and we're gonna read verse 30 it's a prophecy Genesis 15:13 I'm just waiting for you one to turn we're not in a hurry are we why what the devil likes to rush us through life go and do this and do this and say this and hear you and do this you're gonna do this no this just relax let's just have church let's just enjoy the Lord I mean we've got to work to fulfill I mean he gives us the powder fulfill it I mean it's not you trying to do it it's him he's gonna do it he's gonna fulfill his word hallelujah are we are we Genesis 15:13 okay wonderful now and he said unto Abraham this is God speaking know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not this and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterwards afterwards shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy father's and peace there shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the EM rights is not yet full now this is a prophecy God is telling them who became Abraham that his children are going to go down into Egypt they're gonna become slaves they're gonna be afflicted but I'm gonna bring them out with a mighty hand this is this is the prophecy so this word had to be fulfilled and then at the right timing God got a man in his hand and this man was Moses Moses was born to fulfill the scripture because God was going to bring them out with a mighty hand but God uses men for his plan hallelujah so so when God was speaking this to his son Abraham he already had in his mind I'm gonna have a man called Moses born and he's going to go through some trials he's going to go through some hardship hallelujah he'll be raised in Pharaoh's house I mean but he won't stay in Pharaoh's house he will esteem following Christ greater riches than all of this great superpower of Egypt hallelujah God headed in his mind already I mean God just God is not looking upon the earth and saying well maybe I can get this one or maybe I can persuade this one or how can I kind of push these ones into a corner that they'll say yes he had he had you in his mind to fulfill the scripture hallelujah but we have to yield to him I mean give ourselves to him Lord I want to see your word fulfilled in me Amen so now he comes Moses now and we know he is raised in Pharaoh's house I meant any and he kills an Egyptian he knew his mother was was his nurse and she began to just pour into him at a young age you're the deliverer God visited us before you're born now and we were praying we are stirred up we wait a burden now is the season for this prophecy we don't want to be slaves anymore hallelujah and God came to us and we knew you you're going to be the child do you think you would not pour that into them amen because you may not live long enough to see the fulfillment how lujah you'd you if you were her you were to pour it unto Him you're the deliverer are you with me you know some of you look at me like what are you talking about what do you mean pour it unto Him you would say no God has promised us a land and you're gonna God is going to use you to take us to that land I may not know how he'll do it but he's going to use you to do it you'd pour it you and say all become the best Prince you can it isn't Egypt wonderful and enjoy this place and look at this palace I mean you say forget the palace I mean God is going to call you and you're gonna walk with him now I'm gonna just put it in your lap friends we may believe the rapture maybe at this right moment but we're going to prepare for the future and it should be out it's our god-given privilege to tell our children if we be not the ones that are alive and remain someone's going to be here to fulfill it so I would pour it unto them your bodies are going to be changed the same God you feel I'm in the when he steps into the place that one is going to change the atoms in your body hallelujah it may not be me all we did in the grave waiting but I'll come forth first hallelujah because if you die if you're alive you win if you're in Christ that is I mean so I pour it unto them afar as you Jesus loves us I mean he's our Father I mean he's redeemed us his blood is more than enough hallelujah we have full redemption I mean his word is true make sure you pour that into your children your word is his word is true God is not a man that can lie I mean this this is being made fun of it's been diminished and I'll put the message in here - it's been ridiculed it's been diminished people say it's man's ideas it's not man's ideas this word has been proven over and over and over and over again this is God and print don't diminish it - someone's opinion and the culture of the day and this is how they did things forget those things God didn't write his word just for a culture he's the same yesterday today and forever I mean so it's word applied there it applies now it'll play tomorrow it will apply next week it is true Amen I just stand on his word so I may not understand all things but Lord your word is true I know you inspired men and you bypass a mental ideas you took their hands whatever hand they were they begin to write hallelujah they wrote down imagine being Moses tell them you're the weakest man in all the earth tell them you had a temper hallelujah I mean if he was writing Abraham's life and Abraham could stand there he would say don't write that I back slid don't write that I denied that that Sarah my wife just to preserve my embody yeah don't write all of my shame and all my failings please don't write it but it was God writing it was God writing and it wasn't just in Genesis all the way through hallelujah so now Moses Moses is commissioned he knows well before he's commissioned he knows he said he knows he is the deliverer and so she is now is the opportunity he kills one Egyptian this is man trying to fulfill the scripture in his own strength amen Ollie and he tries to deliver Israel he ends up killing one man and he's on the run and God has to take him this is why we have to go through a molding brother Bram speaks about thee about the burning sands where men are molded into Saints the burning deserts of experience where men are molded into Saint each is how we thank you Lord for these things and God will take us that's a good thing it's a good thing I don't want to be molded into this world I'll be molded into him how Elysee it's a good thing so he had to take Moses and get Moses out of Moses see he could pour himself into Moses and use him for what he should have been doing hallelujah and then so now he goes to UM and then now he's ready and then he goes to fulfill of Scripture and he does it the thing is he does it he's an 80 year old man with a wife two kids going down into Egypt you know and he and he takes over let my what he wanted to achieve he achieved under the blood of bulls and goats under the blood of bulls and goats he delivered a people out of the greatest nation at that time he did it that's under the blood of bulls and goats how much under the blood of Jesus Christ do you think King David when he would he when he would begin to write as the heart Penna for the water Brooks so most soul Long's after thee and he had such a desire Amen to be where God was and to serve him and to love him he was just under the blood of bulls and goats do you think if he came into this age he would be rejoicing thank you I always forget something when I come here I appreciate it he would have you know here he is under the blood of bulls ago she has this longing take me into your tabernacle I want to be where you are my heart longs for you but there's a separation between him and God because because he was just under the blood of bulls and goats but now how do you think he would feel coming into this age and then he would actually say do you mean God has released a power that actually change it can change your heart of a person that God could more than just anoint but he can end well hallelujah he'd get beside himself his cup would really run over I mean do you mean God can actually more than just anoint you but he can dwell in you I mean there's more than just you know it being anointed in the anointing leaves but a spurt and dwells I mean that you become the dwelling place the Almighty God he'd get excited you mean God has released a power you can be this kind of person hallelujah that's more than just a longing but you be get to live out that longing you get to actually that longing gets met hello beautiful fill out Scripture amen now we have I'm just gonna talk from my heart for a little bit God came to Mary now we can go all through the Bible remember he told me he told the children of Israel I give you the land it's your land but they had to go fight I mean they had a part to play he says I'll Drive them out before you but you're gonna go fight so the land was given the land was given but they had to go possess that land it's the same so and the people who looked at the promise who looks at the promise the people don't look at don't look at what you may be facing and the Giants in your life look at the promise look at the promise that's the thing only belief don't worry about the circumstance look at the promise if God said that I would be I'd be more than a conqueror I am more than a conquerer doesn't matter what enemy I've got to conquer it's gonna die I'm gonna win Alleluia so they the people who looked at the promise you know the Bible says forget the things which are in the past Paul the Apostle Paul forgetting the things which are in the past now that's pretty straight what does that mean forget it forget the things which are in the past press onto the mark of the high calling they meant so don't worry about my oh you say well I failed just coming to church place it under the blood forget about it I mean don't worry about any you know oh but I did this and I did this and I seen this I should have done that put it under the blood walk on forgive the things which are in the past don't worry about those things God allowed those things you know God allows us to fail God allows us to fall on our face do you know that I mean he he allows it to happen that you will know this by his blood it's by his Spirit that's how you live it's not you doing it sometimes we think I'm such a good Christian he is determined there's a lot of proud people in this world but he does not want pride there's waste pride before the fall but I'm so humble I'm doing so well and we can become proud in our humility if it's if it's man-made false humility and he tries you and he test your knee he allows things because he has a perfect picture of you an eternity he has a perfect picture but then we have to come to a spot and you gonna come through experience it's only by you I've only by you molding and shaping me why do you fall on your face you realize I have this in me we we war with this humanity I do quite a lot but God allowed us to be built in such a way he's not surprised you have the personality you have he's not surprised you have the traits you have he knew you'd have them he has the ability to change you but sometimes he leaves you know sometimes you know which I cannot be more suberin why can't be more you know expressive and God says but I didn't make you that way we're gonna be comfortable in our own shoes right but there's some things like temper and indifference and unforgiveness that all those things we received you know I mean to have those kind of things you know I trust that comes out okay now so Moses now they were told they'll receive the land and those who believed that they fulfilled the scripture that they would possess that land now God gives us the ability to fulfill our scriptures amen he gives us the ability he is Mary now he's Marian this has to be us the angel comes to Mary there's a prophecy a virgin shall conceive and many many people thought that was going to be their daughter but for 800 years about it just sat there in the scripture then finally for the right season and the right person because when God as I said about Moses when God was speaking through Isaiah a virgin shall conceive God had in his mind Mary and she'll be in a certain city in a certain time that'll be her and then the angel comes to her you're going to have the promised son you're going to fulfill this part of the scripture and she just said let it be unto me according to thy word hallelujah this has going to be let it be unto me according to thy word hallelujah and then God caused a virgin to conceive a following me and she fulfilled her part of the scripture Jesus knew the Scriptures he had to fulfill he says for this cause I've come into the world he knew he was the Lamb of God and he spent about six hours talking to the Opus and his friend on the way to Emmaus and Luke chapter 24 starting at Moses he went through all the prophecies and everything that he fulfilled in you had come to fulfill the scripture now here we are here we are in this day we've got scriptures to fulfill I mean God started his work remember the apostles the life member their book of Acts is not the Acts of the Apostles it's the Acts of the Holy Spirit and the Apostles that is the true name of the book of Acts and the book of Acts is still being written hallelujah it's still being manifested it doesn't stop with whatever the last chapter of the book of Acts is it's gone right through history and it's now here and we are still writing a book of Acts I mean we're still writing a book of Acts but God is still using the same program he uses his body upon the earth to fulfill his word now we can't just talk about the scripture we have to become the scripture I mean we have to the word has to become manifest many times we just talk about Jesus and the word became manifest at him but that's just the man what about the what about the woman the bride the word has to become manifested in her amen so now see if I'm find this we have to be sensitive now this may be a bit rough pieces and the unfailing realities of living God I've often thought this and we're closing Church listen to these remarks I've often thought what what why how we've deprived ourselves how we've robbed god of his plan by not surrendering our lives completely to him everything that we have to to him how that we have disallowed his program how we've lingered and have made him to wait and wait and wait trying to find somebody that he could work through trying to find a man somewhere that he could put confidence in some men that would surrender everything you say well God God has his timing but he gave us a free moral agency he doesn't step over he doesn't force you to do anything he's a gentleman he's a gentleman he's waiting on you that some man would surrender everything that his plan would be done God's waiting on us friends he say well he putting a whole works burden upon us no I'm not I want his plan to be manifested in our lives not just individually but but as a body God has a plan there's scriptures when we read about the book of when we read the New Testament a lot of its prophecy amen and then when he talks let's go to this go to he Ephesians chapter 4 my prayer is let's not plateaued let's mature let's grow in grace let's become more like him every day I mean let's not just just take it casually and eyes and everything wonderful no let's let's thank him for what he's done but we got a word to fulfill we've got a scripture to fulfill let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 I know read this a few times but let's just keep this in the forefront of our minds sofie's anne's 4 and verse 12 we just read from here we can't let's not just be let's not be satisfied you know yo we have salvation I trust if you have eternal life rejoice and the fact he died for you just rejoice in that amen Jesus is paid at all ma'am he doesn't let's just I just pray for my heart because many times you say well how could I for Phil it I can't fulfill it I'm unworthy I'm not able God took a bunch of slaves out of Egypt and He fulfilled his word God took fishermen prostitutes demon-possessed people all different kinds of people you know when he is here in the days of his flesh and he made them into the church to fulfill his word that's why I forget the things which are in the past don't weigh where you've been put it make sure it's under the blood and you've made it right but just walk on walk on you know the devil is a very good historian he's a very good historian we're not called to be historians he's a prison guard he's the great I am Devils I say and look back and you did this and he did this and this is back here and no gods present he's fulfilling his word here today right now I mean Sophie jhin's 4 and 12 yep okay so for the perfecting of the Saints now that we're perfecting it as a maturing for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till they all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body until the edifying of itself in love this is what we are aiming becoming I mean every joint supplieth I mean she can be in the sunday-school you can just sing in the service and God comes down you can pray I mean you can be praying before the service praying for one another amen in your prayer closet and you see God coming and answer your prayers that's a joint in the body and remember it's normally though yes you know it's like my body that it's the unseen parts which are really the most valuable amen you don't see my brain but if it got removed you would know its unseen I mean you can break a little bone like break a little toe bone or something and you would never ever normally think about that part of you until it's hurting it's very you'll fight it's very important when it's hurting I need this to be fixed it's like every part of the body it's all important it's all going to be there amen and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what part of the body we are we can be very visible we may be very invisible the invisible parts often are more important than the visible parts brother Bram said the reason is meetings as successful as people are praying for them people praying for the service you may never see those people you may never hear them on tape but they are praying I mean they're asking that God would come and meet you you know take that man of God Minister his word heal the sick amen set the captives free you never see them on tape but they are very important he said the success of my meetings of those people the unseen part the unseen part and that's why we've got to fight for full your scripture whatever part of the body you are I mean we can all be preachers or deacons or song leaders or musicians or whatever but we've got a role we've got a part of the body that we are there's a reason everyone is valuable in the body of Christ there's no just oh you're a few warmers or you know people who are just there to fill out a place that we're all important we're all important we're all needed and that's the reason that that we've been gathered together it's like every Church God brings different gifts to complement the other gifts that every joint would supply hallelujah we're all important in the body but we're going to fulfill our part of the body I just may be speaking kind of broad terms this morning but I want you to think about it I mean we're not here just as a hip hat for haphazard reason just to go through emotion but we have scripture to fulfill hallelujah so we have to grow and to the fullness of the statue of Christ it takes us word to do it amen it takes us word to do it and that's why brother Brahim says we should pray for revelation more than anything else I meant more than more money or a nicer house pray Lord reveal your word to me I may have read it a million times but I may have caught nothing I want to make it more than just in here it's more than memorizing scriptures and quotes but it's got an anchor in here and produce a life I mean that's what it needs to do and that's why revelation will produce a life and will produce a character you see Mose he was raised in Pharaoh's house he was he was going to be the next Pharaoh potentially now royalty member the Pharaohs in those days they were gods and I've said this quite a few times but the Pharaoh in Egypt he was a God and flesh so Moses was going to become of that he was a little meek little quiet fellow when he was there I'm the Prince of Egypt he would have had a persona around him but then he comes into the backside of the desert God malts then he's ready he goes up Mount Sinai God comes down delivers his word and then he writes he's the meekest man and all the earth what how did he become that way because God revealed himself that's a characteristic of the you know that's the nature of God coming into someone under the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah now he received the revelation that made him that way the scribes and Pharisees they had they had the revelation Moses received they learned that revelation they studied that revelation they read it they stated it they were proud arrogant people it didn't produce a character of Christ on them you follow me one's gone very quiet maybe you're thinking a little bit that's why it's got to go revelation reveal your word to me every scripture every message Lord whatever your mind is in that word transmitted it down into me that it will produce a character and me hallelujah that's what we need we've a word to fulfill you know we oftentimes we talk about a rapture that's part of the scripture we're to fulfill amen but we're going to go back and we're going to look at now and and I want in this service but maybe later our husbands treat wives and wives treat husbands and our children I mean parents treat children and children parents that's fulfilling Scripture you say it's just a common everyday thing for husbands to love their wives and wives love their husbands and you know fathers not to provoke their children you know and you know make them angry that they'd be discouraged and every thinks that's fulfilling Scripture you say that's just a common everyday thing the Scriptures everyday common things it's not just some big theory out there somewhere it comes down into flesh hallelujah and it manifests are you following me we've got a scripture to fulfill you know you gotta go back into you go back into the scripture remember our ingo the fullness of redemption is the change of the body to the adoption the would yo the change of the body that's that's in the future but it's got to start happening now I mean because because as our nature and character becomes like our theophany amen like like how God sees us our eternal body that's reserved in the heavens as that becomes we as the character become more like that image and as that image comes together as one in the rapture will go amen because God has a picture of us God's molding our character he knows the end goal he's a very good project manager he's a very good project manager he knows now this is what my goal is I'm gonna have a people made in my image and I know and and that's not some lofty term for him he knows exactly what that is for each of us amen and so now he's got stages on a timeline of how I'm going to get them in hallelujah so that's why I say the image he has in his mind of you you have to become like that image which is this made flesh I mean that's why we read the scripture I heard Francois Lipper card say it just just as a comment he said when he reads this Bible and I've tried to get on board he says when he reached the word he does it he lays himself before God say God as I read your word now make me like your word it's not a now I'm going to study this thing out and work how it goes and see how this happens and no you let yourself before him and say Lord what I read and the character this is a revelation of a person it's the same thing with the message you know there's a character coming forth through that message goes beyond doctrine and terminology but there's a life being manifested and so as we hear that message and read the Bible and pray should be Lord change me he's looking for people made in His image we have to fulfill it's gonna be it's not just part like in like in Luther's day or Wesley's day of the Pentecostal day this is they had part of it and they'll be there like we'll be there but he's looking for a people make totally in his image hallelujah and that's the part of the scripture where to fulfill amen we're not just gonna be he's he's going to take in a rapture mature people amen no don't get the scars all but I'm down here and it's up there how do you know that you're down here and it's up there what we look at ourselves how we view ourselves and how God views us can be miles apart one into the universe to the other and we can look at ourselves and say but I've never been victorious now there's just the devil telling you these things you'll never overcome you think you'll be there you call yourself a Christian you have no right that it editor know Lord what have you said I am you you believe it and then you receive it amen you don't receive it then believe it you believe it and then you receive it Abraham you're going to have a promise son we're gonna have a sudden Sarah 25 years later here's the son but he believed it and then he received it hallelujah you can take it all through the scripture that's how we have to be I'm not gonna go on much longer but I want you to think about it you say well how can I grow to the fullness of statue of Christ how can all that know Lord and he started to work in you have you given castle your cares upon him because he cares you have you laid yourself totally surrendered to him and that's his word have you given yourself Lord whatever your word says I want to do it because I love you that's my motivation it's not that I earn some name or become famous and some Christian realm or whatever I'm not interested in that we're not building a kingdom an earthly Kingdom I mean for some church brand to go forth or something forget that kind of thing we're here that people would become one with Jesus Christ I mean that be united with him it doesn't matter if there's no name on the building if there is a who cares about that stuff when I understood and you know that kind of thing well people that become 1 have a true spiritual relationship with Jesus Christ that's the reason we're here hallelujah that we would grow to the fullest of his image I don't care if I'm not even a footnote in history I don't care about that kind of thing I'm not interested I trust you all the same kind of way I'd rather be an unknown who cares what people say I want to serve Him amen and we all have a reward up there who cares about the praise of men down here doesn't matter it doesn't matter oh you know we're not a brand hears about some brand this gospel is alive and we and you say Lord remember this is not this is not just words on paper this is God and print form this message is not just a hillbilly from Kentucky's idea this is God transmitting himself down this is me speaking this is Jesus Christ making himself known and should be well what should I listen to just start listening and say Lord that's you being made known and so may your character amen change my character so it matches your character how how you look at things may I look the same way only we just like okay all the sons here there's a lot of sons now it comes a time where you just want to be like dad and dad you're here oh I should have had a very much an amen I mean there is that time little boy I just want to be just like that amen they want to do the same things that's why they come I want to help you let you know I want to help you with this and do this because I want to do just like you now I want to be like that with God I want to be just like my daddy because he's my hero Amen he's my ol and old hallelujah I want to talk like him I want to do things like him I don't act like him hallelujah that that's so much we're one that it's him doing it hallelujah when people look down or maybe when he looks down he says he's just like me even you know how you get proud as a dead maybe it's sometimes movie just asleep but hey you know but you know you look daddy you say and you know it makes you so proud doesn't it don't you just don't you just love them if y'all is so wonderful you don't know that's just that's just human love how much more God's love when he looks down remember he looks beyond your faults he looks beyond what you think you are you gotta throw out what you think about yourself take what God has said about you I mean his thoughts towards you are thoughts of peace they're not of destruction now there's just me that's not the scripture it's not a destruction it's not a ruin Amen but it's a fact it's it's of love it's of redemption it's of salvation it's of assurance it's a peace it's of stability hello that's a sauce towards you he's very zealous over you don't leave the devil ooh I think God doesn't know me and he wouldn't ever recognize me and God doesn't care God cares that's why he went and message after message this is your name this is your address this is where you've come from you are sitting here and you're praying here you're wearing this you know through detail sometimes about 20 things about one person and God allow that to be recorded that you could hear that and you can say God if you know about them you sure know about me if you're mindful of them you're very mindful of me because he's the same God yesterday today and forever hallelujah we got a word to fulfill let's have some musicians and we just just finished their fulfill your scriptures you say well you didn't really get into what they were you gonna have a look go listen to the message go listen to I mean go go read the Bible and see what God has said hallelujah fulfill your word friends you say well I could never do it the feds are all under the blood of bulls and goats could take a land and they had no siege equipment I just bunch of slaves that came out of Egypt and they did it I think we can do it I mean if David can down a Goliath under the blood of bulls and goats I think we can do it amen if you knowif amen we're gonna hear a testimony let's have a microphone hello everybody I'm Fe and I'm from Greece Oh forgive my English is not my first language a year ago I had an awful pain and and they found that the hottest stone in my gallbladder and I had to remove my god brother and then we moved here to Wellington and I saw a specialist and I asked him if I should have another scam before the surgery and he said no need if you had it once it's there God bloggers are like stone factories and if it had passed through your system it would have been with so much pain that you would have known so I trust him and I was in the waiting list for the surgery during the time I was reading provost branham's story and he talked about a lady having a stone cold bladder and so I prayed and I asked him to heal me last Wednesday I went to surgery and the doctor before asked me if I wanted to keep the stones another yeah it would be funny to show it to my daughter in love but it and after the surgery I said Oh have my stones and he said no stones you complied I was totally normal there was no story stone in it nothing it was completely normal I said how that happened is that I don't know if the stones had gone through your system you would have known because you would have heard so much and felt so blessed in her I thought I said to God wait since he heard me white to allow the surgery to happen why and then I remembered that last Sunday before the surgery I came here and I had a list of things that I wanted to pray for and I couldn't concentrate and I said God I forget the list please make my faith stronger because that's the most important everything else is gonna happen if my faith is strong and I realized that if I hadn't been through the surgery I wouldn't have known that I mean I got is real yeah amen I mean listening this song I know my redeemer lives hallelujah amen who told the Sun where where to stand in
