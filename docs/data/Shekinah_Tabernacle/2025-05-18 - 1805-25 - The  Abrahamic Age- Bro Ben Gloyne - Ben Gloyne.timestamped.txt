[0:00] [Music]
[3:04] Praise the Lord. God bless you all this
[3:07] morning. What does it feel like to be
[3:09] sitting amongst the company of winners
[3:12] this morning? Feel good?
[3:17] It's it's really quite simple, you know.
[3:19] We have we have two options. We either
[3:22] move forward by faith and believe or we
[3:25] don't believe and we just pull back
[3:28] [Music]
[3:30] and how would I put this? Fail in
[3:34] whatever endeavor we're trying
[3:35] to that we were trying to go forward in.
[3:38] Whether it be for our soul or any
[3:40] situation, you know that or your
[3:41] children or your a spiritual anything.
[3:43] You you either can have faith and move
[3:45] forward or you can have doubt and just
[3:47] pull back. It's the same with with
[3:49] believing. You can either have a a a
[3:51] warm heart and believe in the Lord or
[3:54] you can have what Paul says an evil
[3:56] heart of unbelief. That that and and
[3:58] these two choices, one goes forward this
[4:01] way, one goes back that way. you know,
[4:04] but we have all chosen this morning to
[4:06] be we are believers this morning and we
[4:09] are moving forward by faith this
[4:10] morning. So that's that's what we're
[4:12] doing. And and and as a result of that,
[4:15] everything we ever go in anything, we
[4:17] just go forward. That that's just the
[4:19] way that it works. Then when you have a
[4:21] heart of belief and you move forward by
[4:22] faith, you just go forward in in
[4:25] anything it is. Anything in your life,
[4:27] if you want salvation, you move forward
[4:29] into that. you need healing, you need
[4:30] anything, you need whatever it is, it's
[4:32] all just there. We just move forward
[4:34] into it. If I've learned anything in my
[4:36] Christian walk, that's it. It's that
[4:38] simple. We just believe the Lord. We
[4:39] move forward. We we we take him at his
[4:41] word and we move forward. And I think
[4:43] that's why Brother Brad's theme song was
[4:45] only believe. All things are possible.
[4:48] Only believe. Just believe and move
[4:51] forward. So, let's stand this morning
[4:53] and let's um lay hold upon this
[4:55] opportunity that we have to believe and
[4:57] move forward. Let's just shake hands
[4:59] with each other and appreciate that
[5:01] we're in the company of believers and
[5:03] champions and winners that uh that have
[5:06] a warm heart of belief and we are moving
[5:08] forward in the name of the Lord this
[5:09] morning. That's who we are. And
[5:11] encourage one another. You know, we we
[5:13] just want to encourage each other daily
[5:14] to to keep believing, keep moving
[5:16] forward. You know, there's there's no
[5:18] value in pulling and drawing back and
[5:19] pulling back. There's no value in that.
[5:21] There's no there's no victory in that.
[5:23] his only victory and moving forward in
[5:25] the Lord and believing and taking him at
[5:27] his word. Praise the
[5:29] [Music]
[5:31] Lord. Let's have brother Armand up here
[5:34] to open in prayer, too. He's a man of
[5:37] [Music]
[5:44] faith. God bless you, bro. Love you,
[5:46] man.
[5:48] [Music]
[5:57] Okay, let us just bow our
[6:00] heads. We just want to come before you,
[6:03] Lord, and say thank you so much, Father,
[6:05] that you have a purpose for us, Lord.
[6:08] The reason we're here, Lord, is because
[6:09] you predestinate us to be here. Father,
[6:13] it's a privilege to sit in these pews,
[6:15] Lord, to come to a place where we can
[6:17] worship you, Father, in spirit and in
[6:20] truth, Father. So today, as we come,
[6:22] Lord, we ask that you'll just take
[6:24] preeminence in the service. You'll take
[6:26] over every believer, Father, our
[6:29] unbelief, Lord. Would you take that
[6:31] away? Encourage us in faith like Brother
[6:34] Isaac said, Lord, that we can move
[6:35] forward, Lord, into a higher place where
[6:38] you can speak to us, Father. We have
[6:40] come prepared vessels, Lord. And we ask
[6:42] you, Lord, the ground is good. Would you
[6:45] sew your seeds of eternal life, your
[6:47] word into our hearts, Lord, and give us
[6:49] overcoming power in this age, Lord.
[6:52] Father, to make us stand and walk in a
[6:54] higher place, Father, we ask that you'll
[6:56] just take Brother Ben, minister through
[6:59] his lips, Lord. May we receive it as
[7:01] thus sayaith the Lord for us day, Lord.
[7:04] Lord, that when we walk out here, we
[7:06] changed,
[7:07] renewed, and strengthened, Father. Amen.
[7:09] We ask this only Lord in the name of our
[7:12] Lord Jesus Christ. We give you all the
[7:14] glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[7:18] Lord. Let's sing. Wonderful, wonderful

[33:25] long to
[33:28] worship you
[33:33] [Music]
[33:39] allel how we
[33:42] long to
[33:45] worship
[33:47] you. Hallelujah.
[33:50] Aren't you glad that that longing can be
[33:52] satisfied in his presence? Amen.
[33:55] Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful? It's
[33:57] not just something that can never
[33:58] happen. It's not a carrot that's too far
[34:00] away, but he says, "I'm with you. I'm in
[34:02] you." Amen. Hallelujah. We can worship
[34:05] him in spirit and in truth this morning.
[34:07] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Amen.
[34:09] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. You
[34:11] can have your seats this morning. We got
[34:13] Sister Tabitha's got a um got a
[34:15] testimony she'd like to share. So, Amen.
[34:17] We want to hear that. Amen. So, God
[34:19] bless you.
[34:31] It's never easy to come before the
[34:33] saints because it's literally gods. Um,
[34:37] I just want to say thank you for the
[34:40] brother Isaac, you have no idea, but the
[34:44] songs were just in line. I was not
[34:47] planning to stand here but the be peace
[34:50] be still song it's literally what has
[34:53] been going on
[34:55] and I've shared this with my husband and
[34:58] he knows what's happening it has been
[35:01] really tough few weeks for me it's
[35:04] mental it's never physical it's mental
[35:06] if you've suffered depression before you
[35:08] understand what I mean so you'll always
[35:10] fight mental battles but that's where
[35:13] the devil always comes to attack first
[35:15] because he knows Because faith comes by
[35:17] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[35:19] So if he can temper with your mind, how
[35:21] will you hear and understand what God
[35:23] wants you to hear? And that reflection
[35:26] of the word is what God wants us to have
[35:28] every time. And just having that all the
[35:32] time and remembering
[35:35] that the devil will always be on attack.
[35:39] It's I'm speaking for myself on attack
[35:42] for me mentally. I always have to
[35:45] remember to put the word as my
[35:47] reflection all the time because it's
[35:50] really hard
[35:51] sometimes. Um the past few weeks we've
[35:54] the past few months we've been on
[35:56] training at work and sometimes I just
[35:58] feel so stupid like there's nothing I'm
[36:01] getting and um on Tuesday I was going
[36:05] through some tasks that it was really
[36:08] really really
[36:09] hard
[36:11] and one of my coaches just decided to
[36:16] smack me left right center and on top of
[36:19] all the things that were going on I felt
[36:21] life I have messed up and if you are a
[36:25] firstborn I don't know if you can relate
[36:28] you don't want to always make mistakes I
[36:29] can't relate because he's a first one
[36:31] and she has so much pressure but if
[36:34] you're a firstborn you don't want to
[36:35] make mistakes you want to always be
[36:37] right you want to be perfect and so with
[36:39] all that and all that devil is trying to
[36:41] do I felt really really bad but one
[36:44] thing I really told God is I'm your
[36:48] child and you know my intentions
[36:51] At the end of the day, I have the right
[36:55] to the Bible has said I have the power
[36:57] to
[36:59] lose and to um what does what does he
[37:02] say? To bind and to lose and I can use
[37:06] it to curse or I can use it to bless. I
[37:10] am a child of God. I have that power. So
[37:12] just remember that. But then I also have
[37:15] to be smart with the wisdom of God, not
[37:18] with the wisdom of man to use it
[37:21] carelessly. So I told God, look, I have
[37:24] done this before and I don't want to do
[37:25] it just
[37:26] carelessly. Let your will be done in
[37:29] this situation because you know my
[37:31] intentions and you know what I really
[37:34] needed to do. At the end of the day, if
[37:37] I've made a mistake, just correct it for
[37:40] me.
[37:42] And my coach made me feel like I have
[37:45] really really messed up that client's
[37:47] account. But let me tell you the
[37:50] following day um the the main coach came
[37:53] in and she told me imagine you did not
[37:55] make any mistakes. Actually everything
[37:58] turned out exactly as it was meant to
[38:00] be. And I was like, "Wow, okay.
[38:05] Yesterday I was really, really low and I
[38:07] knew I had messed up, but then today
[38:11] you're coming and telling me." So, I
[38:12] actually didn't make any
[38:14] mistake and I came and realized God
[38:18] already went
[38:19] before and cleared all the things that I
[38:22] thought were mistakes. So, when human
[38:25] comes and see mistakes, there's actually
[38:28] no mistakes. Hallelujah. And to me that
[38:31] really just humbled me so much. And I
[38:34] remember the scripture that says be be
[38:36] still and know that I am God. Being
[38:39] still does not mean you do nothing or
[38:41] you sit there and cry and say our is
[38:43] over. It it really really means just go
[38:47] there and wait on God. It's the hardest
[38:51] thing to do when you're all not okay
[38:54] here. But being still is waiting on God.
[38:57] We are
[38:58] gods. Even when we don't feel like it,
[39:02] even when we don't believe at that time,
[39:05] you're still a God. Just say it, but use
[39:09] it for the right purpose of God. And
[39:12] those who may be struggling in one way
[39:14] or another, I just want to encourage you
[39:16] that you are a God whether you feel like
[39:18] it or you don't feel like it. I I never
[39:20] feel like it most of the time, but I
[39:23] still be still and know I'm God. Thank
[39:26] you. God bless you.
[39:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Appreciate that,
[39:36] Sister Tabitha. Thank you so much. Amen.
[39:38] Let's stand, shall we? Let's sing that
[39:40] song, Ella. Elohim one more time, shall

[42:56] God bless you. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[43:00] Welcome. Amen. God bless you all. Amen.
[43:02] Let's turn to the scripture this
[43:04] morning. I actually have a slideshow
[43:06] today. Amen. So, you can turn, you can
[43:09] look, you can do whatever you wish to
[43:11] do. So,
[43:15] Amen. Amen. So, Luke 17 and
[43:35] Amen. Luke 17 here. Sorry, I'm just
[43:37] reading something else here. Luke 17:26.
[43:40] And as it was in the days of Noah, so
[43:41] shall it also be in the days of the Son
[43:43] of Man. They did eat, they drank, they
[43:45] married wives, they were given a
[43:46] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[43:48] into the ark, and the flood came and
[43:49] destroyed them all. Likewise also as it
[43:51] was in the days of Lot, they did eat,
[43:53] they drank, they bought, they sold, they
[43:55] planted, they builded, but the same day
[43:57] that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained
[43:59] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[44:00] destroyed them all, even um thus shall
[44:03] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[44:05] revealed. Now, and and then we're going
[44:07] to go to First John 5. I just want to
[44:09] read this from Isaiah. I just open my
[44:11] Bible. I don't I just want to read this
[44:12] here from Isaiah um 44. He
[44:15] says,"Remember these, oh Jacob and
[44:18] Israel, for thou art my servant. I have
[44:20] formed thee. Thou art my servant, O
[44:22] Israel. Thou shalt not be forgotten of
[44:24] me. I have blotted out as a thick cloud
[44:26] thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy
[44:28] sins. Return unto me, for I have
[44:30] redeemed thee. Sing, oh ye heavens, for
[44:32] the Lord hath done it. Shout ye lower
[44:34] parts of the earth. Break forth into
[44:36] singing, ye mountains, oh forest, and
[44:38] every tree therein, for the Lord hath
[44:40] redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in
[44:42] Israel." Hallelujah. Thus sayith the
[44:45] Lord thy redeemer, and he that formed
[44:47] thee from the womb. I am the Lord that
[44:49] maketh all things, that stretcheth forth
[44:51] the heavens alone, that spreadth abroad
[44:53] the earth by myself. Amen. that
[44:56] frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and
[44:59] maketh diviners mad, that turnneth wise
[45:02] men backward, and maketh their knowledge
[45:05] foolish, that confirmth the word of his
[45:07] servant, and performth the council of
[45:09] his messengers, that uh that saith to
[45:11] Jerusalem, thou shalt be inhabited to
[45:13] the cities of Judah, ye have shall be
[45:15] built, and I will raise up the decayed
[45:17] places thereof. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:21] Amen. And then we're going to go to 1
[45:23] John 5 and we're going to read here uh
[45:26] just this portion of scripture. Bit of a
[45:28] context. Um he says, "Whosoever buildeth
[45:31] I mean sorry, whosoever believeth that
[45:32] Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And
[45:34] everyone that loveth him that begat
[45:36] loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[45:39] By this uh we know that we love the
[45:41] children of God when we love God and
[45:42] keep his commandments. For this is the
[45:44] love of God that we keep his
[45:46] commandments and his commandments are
[45:48] not grievious. For whosoever is born of
[45:50] God, overcometh the world. This is the
[45:52] scripture I really want to get to. He
[45:54] overcomemeth the world, and this is the
[45:56] victory that overcomemeth the world,
[45:57] even our faith. Amen. Who is he that
[46:00] overcomemeth the world, but he that
[46:02] believeth that Jesus is the son of God.
[46:05] Amen. You may have your seats this
[46:07] morning. May the Lord bless the reading
[46:08] of his word. Now, I want to take a take
[46:11] a thought here and and and we'll just
[46:12] see how this all goes. But you know, I
[46:15] read this the other day, Luke 17, and it
[46:18] dawned on me, and I know this is
[46:19] probably the penny drops. It takes a
[46:21] while for it to drop. But, you know,
[46:22] Brother Brand speaks to this quite a
[46:24] lot, but in the days of Lot, you know,
[46:25] we read this scripture, we look at the
[46:27] condition of Sodom and the destruction
[46:29] that's coming and all these things. But
[46:31] we know in the days of Lot is the days
[46:32] of Abraham. Amen. So, there's an elected
[46:35] called out people that God was dealing
[46:37] with during this time. And and and you
[46:40] know to me this is such a blessing
[46:41] because brother Brand makes a qu well he
[46:43] poses a question in this day is this
[46:45] scripture fulfilled. He says he says
[46:47] here now the same suen that raised in
[46:49] the east is the same suen that sits in
[46:51] the west and the same sen of God that
[46:54] came in the east vindicated himself as
[46:56] God manifest in the flesh is the same
[46:58] sen of God in the western hemisphere
[47:00] here that's identifying himself among
[47:03] the church tonight I'll say this morning
[47:05] the same yesterday today and forever the
[47:07] evening light of the sun has come this
[47:10] day the scriptures fulfilled before us
[47:12] where we at in this Abrahamic age and
[47:15] that phrase just really stood out to me.
[47:17] This Abrahamic age, you know, we call it
[47:19] the, you know, there's many different
[47:20] titles to the time we live in, but it's
[47:22] the age, this is Abrahamic age. Amen.
[47:25] Where there's a people who have been
[47:26] called by the grace of God. God's given
[47:29] them an unconditional co covenant which
[47:31] will take them all the way into a body
[47:33] change. Now, Abraham walked by faith by
[47:36] revelation. Now, I like this um verse
[47:40] here in, you know, first John that we
[47:42] read in 1 John 5 that this victory that
[47:44] overcometh the world. Now this word
[47:45] victory, it means by the means of
[47:47] success. This is how you're going to
[47:49] conquer. This is how you overcome. It's
[47:50] by the revelation given to you. Amen. So
[47:54] it's faith. Because I was thinking the
[47:55] other day, I was thinking, you know,
[47:56] there's a lot of things that we identify
[47:58] of things that we are the devices of the
[48:01] enemy. We're not ignorant to his
[48:02] devices, but it's one thing to identify
[48:05] the enemy, but how do you overcome him?
[48:07] How do you conquer him? How do you
[48:08] subdue him? How do you how do you get
[48:10] the victory over him? See, that's the
[48:12] big thing. See, we can identify him, but
[48:14] we got to know how to beat him. Amen.
[48:17] And it's actually very quite simple. It
[48:20] takes revelation. It takes the faith of
[48:21] the word for you to overcome. Amen. So,
[48:24] and you know, there's nothing as
[48:25] prevailing as revelation. I know I've
[48:27] said these things, maybe we're just
[48:28] summarizing. I don't know. But, you
[48:30] know, there's nothing as as prevailing
[48:32] power, the prophet says, as revelation.
[48:34] When God drops in your heart, you're a
[48:36] son of God, that changes your whole
[48:38] world. I mean, the things you once
[48:40] wrestled with, you don't wrestle with no
[48:41] more. You live above the devil and his
[48:44] and his influence and you know and and
[48:46] his control. Why? Because faith has come
[48:48] in and you see who you are. When Calvary
[48:51] becomes a revelation more than a story,
[48:53] more than a song, but it comes a living
[48:55] reality that makes you rise up above.
[48:58] Amen. Condemnation. You know, there's a
[49:01] cycle and it seems to be every autumn
[49:02] that that that that this trauma will
[49:04] come back into people's lives and you
[49:06] know, the enemy tries to raise its ugly
[49:08] head again. But there comes a time when
[49:10] that cycle must be broken. Amen. I
[49:12] believe we're living in that season
[49:14] where the enemy will try and come back
[49:15] again, but he ain't staying again. Amen.
[49:20] You got to realize, you know, there
[49:21] seems to be something and it's not just,
[49:23] you know, among believers, but people in
[49:24] general, you come to the season of
[49:26] autumn, it seems like things just come
[49:28] back around and and really the reason
[49:30] that they come back around is that God
[49:32] wants to take them out.
[49:34] Faith will overcome it. Amen. Faith will
[49:36] overcome it. Amen. And you know, and so
[49:39] so I I I believe with all my heart,
[49:41] we're living in an Abrahamic age where
[49:43] every cycle will be broken. I mean, you
[49:45] look at the condition that Abraham and
[49:47] Sarah were in. They were in a monthly
[49:48] cycle of disappointment. Amen. Of of
[49:51] being married as, you know, young people
[49:52] and they, you know, couldn't have
[49:54] children. You know, she was she was
[49:56] sterile and so was he. And you know they
[49:58] came to this point where this cycle of
[50:00] of pain and sadness and
[50:03] longing became a cycle of joy and
[50:06] laughter and peace and happiness because
[50:10] it wasn't just remember Isaac was called
[50:11] Isaac because of laughter right and it
[50:14] wasn't just Abraham that you know
[50:16] because it says that Sarah laughed in
[50:17] the tent because of unbelief. She did
[50:19] laugh, right? But then Abraham before
[50:21] that also laughed in the presence of
[50:23] God, laughing within himself, saying,
[50:25] "How on earth can this be fulfilled?"
[50:28] Why? Because they've been living in a
[50:29] cycle of of sadness and longing and and
[50:33] you know, it just they just couldn't
[50:35] have a child. But God had come to break
[50:38] that cycle.
[50:41] This is the Abrahamic age.
[50:44] Amen. This is this is the time when
[50:46] every cycle must be broken and God does
[50:48] the breaking. Amen. God does the
[50:50] breaking. He does the molding. He does
[50:52] the shaping. And so Abraham was called
[50:54] by grace. Brother Bram was even he said
[50:56] he was even criticized that he believed
[50:58] in grace because he came out of an age
[51:00] of legalism. The Pentecostals, brother
[51:02] Bram said, were great legalists. They
[51:04] would they would have to do something to
[51:07] obtain favor of God. So what was the
[51:09] thing that they focused on? If you speak
[51:11] in tongues, you've got it. So if I've
[51:13] done this, therefore I qualify. But we
[51:15] qualify by grace. We qualify by God's
[51:19] unconditional favor and love and you
[51:21] know mercy in our lives. So brother
[51:23] Brown was criticized by preaching a
[51:25] gospel of grace as the apostle Paul did.
[51:28] Now Abraham was called by grace. You
[51:32] know we know these things but I just but
[51:34] you know the Bible says that we walk in
[51:35] the faith of Abraham. So the same
[51:37] journey that Abraham went upon is the
[51:39] same as the same one that we go on. Now
[51:42] God called Abraham by grace. It wasn't
[51:44] anything he did. His father and his
[51:46] family and him were came out of Babel.
[51:48] They were idol worshippers. But God
[51:49] said, "I'm going to break that
[51:50] idolatrous spirit out of your life. I'm
[51:53] going to begin to break cycles out of
[51:54] your life, Abraham, that you because
[51:57] what you think you are is you don't know
[51:59] who you are." Right? So now here comes
[52:02] God. He begins to call Abraham. And God
[52:04] just decides to get up and leave with
[52:06] Sarah and whoever came with him, Lot and
[52:08] different, you know, different ones. But
[52:10] God God be to break cycles in his life
[52:12] that that finally God when God showed
[52:15] him, look at the sand, your seed will be
[52:17] like this. Look at the stars, they'll be
[52:19] like this. It says, "And Abraham
[52:20] believed God and it was attributed to
[52:23] him for righteousness." So when God was
[52:25] speaking to Abraham, there's something
[52:27] in Abraham believed what he was being
[52:29] told. It's the same thing with you and
[52:31] I. There's something in us when this
[52:33] message comes our way, we choose to
[52:34] believe it. We can't put it together. It
[52:37] doesn't all make sense. And that's fine.
[52:39] It's a faith walk. You meet someone
[52:41] who's got it all together. You got to
[52:43] realize one thing. They don't because
[52:45] they're trying to put God in a box and
[52:46] God is unboxable. Amen. That's why he
[52:49] steps out of denominational systems.
[52:51] When anyone puts a full stop after their
[52:53] belief, he steps out of that person.
[52:55] Why? Because God says, "You can't box
[52:57] me." Man has tried to box him, but you
[52:59] can't box them. Amen. So now, so, so, so
[53:02] it's a faith walk. But you see,
[53:04] revelation or faith is the means of
[53:06] success in our journey. And it was It
[53:09] was the same in Abraham's life. If you
[53:11] look at a man, physically impossible.
[53:13] Let's just put ourselves there. You are
[53:16] well past age. See? See? Isn't it
[53:18] interesting? He calls Abraham to have
[53:20] this promised son not when he's 20, not
[53:23] when he's 30, not when he's peak
[53:25] fertility or whatever. I don't know what
[53:27] time that is in life, but you know, he
[53:29] wasn't at that peak. It was at his at
[53:31] after after impossible. You know, if you
[53:34] took a graph of peak fertility, he was
[53:36] down this tail end where it was
[53:37] virtually possibility zero. And God did
[53:41] that for a reason. Because God wanted to
[53:43] show future generations, remember
[53:45] because because Abraham was a type or is
[53:47] a shadow or a or or a template or
[53:49] however you want to say it, a model of
[53:51] every true Christian down through the
[53:53] ages. And God wanted to show through his
[53:56] life and his hurt and his suffering and
[53:58] his longing for a child. Look, I'm going
[54:00] to bring you to a point where you can't
[54:02] even do it. where you cannot put
[54:04] yourself any any of your own. This was
[54:06] me. I helped God in this. This is this
[54:09] is where he brought Abraham into this
[54:11] this place where because people try to
[54:13] think they have something to do with
[54:14] their salvation or they have something
[54:16] to do with their walk. Well, do you
[54:18] listen? Do you read? Sure. But it's the
[54:19] grace of God that quickens the word into
[54:22] your heart. Amen. It's the grace of God
[54:23] that brings it alive. You can read all
[54:25] you want. Study all you want. Please do
[54:27] it. But you got to depend upon God. God
[54:29] as I'm reading and as I'm praying and as
[54:31] I'm listening make it a living reality
[54:33] in my life that's not just here in my
[54:35] top two inches it anchors down as a
[54:37] revelation in my soul. Amen. So there he
[54:40] is. He comes to this point he can't do
[54:42] you know he can't fulfill it. God calls
[54:44] him and then God begins to uh God begins
[54:47] to deal with his life and bring him
[54:49] through many different stages.
[54:51] Now brother Bram speaks well the Bible
[54:55] speaks you know you know my wife said
[54:56] put some pictures in. Since I'm putting
[54:58] pictures in here's here's the first
[54:59] picture. Abraham has three visitors. We
[55:02] know this is in Genesis chapter 18. By
[55:04] this stage, God is already called uh you
[55:07] know changed Abraham's name from Abraham
[55:09] to Abraham and Sarite to Sarah. You
[55:11] know, God God put that uh H or the
[55:14] Hebrew. It's the breath of God came into
[55:16] them, changed their names. Amen. They'd
[55:18] have a different walk from then on
[55:20] because God would God would change their
[55:22] name. Like brother Bram said, I no
[55:23] longer call you church. I call you
[55:24] bride. that you'll understand your
[55:26] position. Amen. Isn't it amazing? A
[55:28] bride, you know, God, you know, we ain't
[55:30] going through a tribulation. Amen. The
[55:32] tribulation is the purging of the
[55:34] church, purging of nature, purging of
[55:36] all these things. But but but the blood
[55:38] of Jesus Christ has completely purchased
[55:40] of all sin. Amen. There's not one bit
[55:43] that's left undone. He's done it all.
[55:45] Amen. By one offering, he's perfected
[55:47] forever them that are sanctified. Amen.
[55:49] The scripture says, so you know, Brother
[55:51] Ram says, "Will will his bride go
[55:53] through the tribulation?" No sir, he
[55:55] will he will keep her from that hour of
[55:56] temptation. Take her up into a rapture.
[55:59] Amen. So here's here's Abraham because
[56:00] we're living in this Abrahamic age. I
[56:02] know I've you know gone gone through a
[56:04] lot just in a little bit right there,
[56:06] but I want to come down to this point
[56:08] because God has already changed his
[56:10] name. God has already given him a
[56:12] sacrifice. He's confirmed the covenant
[56:14] with them. And now Abraham's waiting for
[56:16] the manifestation of that promise which
[56:18] is Isaac coming. So now Abraham is
[56:21] waiting. It says that you know in
[56:22] Genesis 18 he's he he's there in the
[56:24] heat of the day in the plains of memory
[56:26] and he and he sees three men walking
[56:28] towards him. Now he addresses one as
[56:32] God. One of them is God. Two are angels
[56:34] put into bodies of flesh. You say can
[56:36] God make bodies of flesh to step into?
[56:39] Absolutely. He can just go take some
[56:41] dust and blow. And it's because he's the
[56:44] creator, right? Because after this
[56:46] conversation that that that we'll talk
[56:48] about briefly here, God, it says the
[56:50] Lord stayed with Abraham and the two
[56:52] angels went down into Sodom to see what
[56:54] was going on. So now here is here is the
[56:57] visitation. Here is a visitation of of
[57:00] God himself or Elohim who's God in flesh
[57:04] to Abraham. Now God is coming to do this
[57:06] because he needs to change Abraham and
[57:09] Sarah to be young again. Turn them from
[57:11] doubt into faith. Now the reason that
[57:14] God could I mean Abraham could identify
[57:17] God there as a man is because he had met
[57:20] God before. Amen. After he had got um
[57:24] Lot from that battle you know you know
[57:26] Lot was taken captive. There was a war
[57:28] going on and Lot was entangled in that
[57:30] as a prisoner of war and Abraham armed
[57:32] his servants got Lot back and all these
[57:34] things. Then it says then then Malesc
[57:36] the king of Salem came out. Amen. And
[57:39] you know blessed Abraham and you know
[57:40] they had communion and all these things.
[57:43] Now I find it very interesting that this
[57:45] this this malesc we know is more than a
[57:48] man right he wasn't a human man if I you
[57:51] know a natural king and this is a great
[57:53] debate that comes up if you if you look
[57:55] in you you know you Google who do people
[57:57] say Malazdc is people say he was a
[58:00] literal man you know you he just a
[58:02] natural king that died or he's just a
[58:04] priesthood or but isn't it amazing god
[58:06] would come down this end time and
[58:07] actually identify in the message who is
[58:09] this mazdc right because what what what
[58:12] Malchzdc did back there is what he's
[58:15] doing here. Amen. And we know that
[58:17] Malchzdc, you know, because we just read
[58:19] this. Isn't it neat? You just read the
[58:20] Bible, you know, all the answers are
[58:23] just it's it's pretty plain as day. I
[58:25] put it in yellow just to highlight it,
[58:26] but you know. Yeah. So for this Mazdc,
[58:29] king of Salem, priest of the most high
[58:31] God, who met Abraham, returning from the
[58:33] slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
[58:35] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[58:37] of all, first being by interpretation
[58:39] king of righteousness, and also the king
[58:41] of Salem, which is the prince uh king of
[58:43] peace, without father, without mother,
[58:45] without descent, uh having neither
[58:47] beginning of days, nor end of life, but
[58:48] made like under the son of God, abideth
[58:50] a priest continually. So he didn't have
[58:53] a mom, he didn't have a dad, he didn't
[58:55] have a beginning, he didn't have an end.
[58:57] Who can this be? He's eternal. Who can
[58:59] it be? It's God. Amen. It's God came
[59:02] down. Praise the Lord. Served his son.
[59:05] Communion. Amen. After Abraham had won
[59:07] the battle. And brother Ram says that
[59:09] after you win the battle over yourself,
[59:11] you die out to your old self. God comes
[59:13] down and gives you communion. Amen.
[59:16] Gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[59:18] Seals you into the body. Amen. When you
[59:20] when you decide to choose God's word
[59:22] above your own flesh, you surrender and
[59:24] die out and let those desires die on the
[59:26] altar of God, the fire of God comes
[59:28] down. What's that? That's Malesc coming
[59:30] to you to give you oil. I mean, well,
[59:33] yeah, give you oil, but give you bread
[59:34] and wine. Amen. So, brother Abraham
[59:36] teaches very simply that Malesc became
[59:39] Jesus Christ. He changed forms. Amen.
[59:42] So, so he, so this was Malchazdc was God
[59:45] as a theophony. He came down, he spoke
[59:47] to Abraham, gave him the communion, but
[59:49] then he went from theophony to flesh in
[59:52] Jesus Christ. It was the same God all
[59:54] the way down through the scripture. And
[59:55] brother Ram says the reason that Jesus
[59:57] could know all things and you knew he
[59:59] was a son of God and all these things
[1:00:01] even, you know, as a young child is
[1:00:03] because he went from theophony to flesh.
[1:00:05] But brother Ram says we skipped around
[1:00:07] our theophony and went straight to
[1:00:09] flesh. So when we were born here, we
[1:00:11] didn't know who we were. We didn't know
[1:00:12] that we came from God going back to God.
[1:00:14] We didn't know we're his children at all
[1:00:16] because we bypassed our theophony. But
[1:00:18] then our theophony begins to deal in our
[1:00:20] lives and influence us and get a hold of
[1:00:22] us and you know grip us and influence
[1:00:24] us. We then our eyes come open like
[1:00:26] Abraham's did. I'm a son of God.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah. Amen. In this time when the
[1:00:33] world is falling apart, there's a people
[1:00:36] who are not fall. I'm just going to
[1:00:37] segue real quick because I just want to
[1:00:38] maybe God just wants to put a stability
[1:00:40] in our lives. I believe he does. Amen.
[1:00:42] Because everything that can be shaken
[1:00:43] will be shaken. The Bible says, but all
[1:00:45] that cannot be shaken will remain. And
[1:00:48] those things, the eternal word of God
[1:00:49] and a people. Amen. So this world can
[1:00:51] shake. Economies can shake. Nuclear war
[1:00:54] can shake above the people. Whatever the
[1:00:56] pope says, who cares? He'll do what
[1:00:58] he'll do. You know, world leaders, but
[1:01:00] there is a people upon the earth that
[1:01:03] will not be shaken with this world.
[1:01:04] That's why you got to keep your eyes on
[1:01:06] the promise of the word. Amen. Keep your
[1:01:08] eyes on who God has made you to be.
[1:01:10] Remember, we he he did not send you this
[1:01:13] message just to fill your head with
[1:01:14] information. No. Oh yes, I'm at the end
[1:01:17] time. It is far more than that. Amen.
[1:01:18] No. God sent you this message to
[1:01:20] transform your life, to fill you with
[1:01:22] his Holy Ghost. That the full power of
[1:01:24] Calvary would be manifested in you.
[1:01:26] Amen. That the power of the blood would
[1:01:28] be on display. Amen. Everywhere you go,
[1:01:30] amen. How you treat people, how you
[1:01:32] walk, how you talk, how you act. Amen.
[1:01:34] Something is undying faith in your life.
[1:01:37] Amen. Because God wants to prove his
[1:01:39] victory over the enemy. Amen. That's why
[1:01:41] he said by the means of faith, we have
[1:01:43] our victory. Hallelujah. He wants to
[1:01:46] prove it in you. He wants to prove it in
[1:01:48] me. So I say, Lord, come prove it. Amen.
[1:01:52] Amen. It's like Abraham, excuse
[1:01:54] me. Abraham knew he couldn't do it. He's
[1:01:57] waiting for a visitation. Praise the
[1:02:00] Lord. He got the visitation.
[1:02:03] Now, so Abraham had a walk of grace. I
[1:02:08] find it very interesting that Melzdc is
[1:02:10] only spoken of by three people in the
[1:02:11] scripture. One is one is Abraham. He had
[1:02:15] a grace walk. He had a faith walk with
[1:02:17] God cuz God came to him and he never
[1:02:20] said, "So, I'm just going
[1:02:22] to clear out some clues or something."
[1:02:26] God did not say to Abraham, "If you do
[1:02:28] this, then I'll make you father of
[1:02:30] nations." He said, "I have made you
[1:02:32] father of nations." Before Abraham had a
[1:02:34] son, the ability to have a son or
[1:02:37] anything. God said, "I've made you
[1:02:39] thus." And Abraham believed God. And it
[1:02:42] was appeared to him for righteousness.
[1:02:44] He just believed it. Amen. So he he had
[1:02:46] a walk by grace. Amen. The sons and
[1:02:49] daughters of Abraham have the same
[1:02:51] thing. But the second person to speak of
[1:02:53] Malazc is actually King David. He wrote
[1:02:56] about him in the Psalms that thou art a
[1:02:58] priest after the order of Malchazdc. So,
[1:03:00] and if you look at David, the scripture
[1:03:02] would say that David uh God had given
[1:03:04] him the sure mercies of David, given to
[1:03:07] David, these sure mercies. Because if
[1:03:09] you look at David's life and you look at
[1:03:11] Saul's life, Saul did nothing compared
[1:03:13] to David. Talk about sins and trouble
[1:03:15] and things that he did, he did nothing.
[1:03:17] The first thing that Saul or second
[1:03:19] thing he did, he's out of the picture.
[1:03:21] But David, no, he had a grace covenant
[1:03:25] with God. Amen. He he was walking by
[1:03:27] grace. Amen. It was even transcended the
[1:03:30] law and everything because even really,
[1:03:32] you know, when Nathan came to him and
[1:03:33] said, "Look, you committed adultery with
[1:03:35] Bashibba. You're the man and all these
[1:03:36] things, he should have been killed,
[1:03:39] but he had the but God gave him sure
[1:03:41] mercies." Did he earn it? Did he deserve
[1:03:43] it? No. But God gave it to him. Do we do
[1:03:46] did we earn the grace of God? Is it
[1:03:48] something you did? Something you said at
[1:03:50] the right time you kind of something
[1:03:52] that you thought or you put together?
[1:03:54] Absolutely not. It was God gave it to
[1:03:56] you. Amen. And as God gave it to you.
[1:03:58] And if he gave it to you, he ain't
[1:03:59] taking it from you. Amen. Why? Cuz his
[1:04:01] grace is here to get a hold of your
[1:04:03] life. I mean, to walk with you, to carry
[1:04:05] you through this life's journey that
[1:04:07] whatever you come across, you will
[1:04:08] overcome it by the grace of God. Amen.
[1:04:12] So that was David. He did many things.
[1:04:14] He outnumbered the people, took
[1:04:16] Bashibba, did all these terrible things.
[1:04:18] He did far greater than the sins of
[1:04:20] Saul. But he had the sure mercies. Why?
[1:04:24] I I believe that. Now, this is just me.
[1:04:26] He wrote about males. So he came under
[1:04:28] the inspiration that that Abraham came
[1:04:30] under and he spoke of malesc. Amen. Why?
[1:04:34] Because God gave him grace. And the
[1:04:36] third one to write about uh malesc is
[1:04:39] the apostle Paul. No one no other um
[1:04:41] apostle, prophet, disciple in the New
[1:04:44] Testament wrote about him. Only Paul
[1:04:46] did. And you know what a big complaint
[1:04:48] against the Apostle Paul is in this day?
[1:04:51] He believes in grace.
[1:04:53] He's so quick this cheap grace and
[1:04:55] doesn't have to earn anything and like
[1:04:57] James speaks about you know we know the
[1:04:59] scriptures looking you know like you
[1:05:01] know um James so people complain about
[1:05:05] Paul because he talks about faith and
[1:05:08] the grace of God and it's not about
[1:05:10] works but you look at James especially
[1:05:13] Peter different ones it's about the
[1:05:15] works but we know from the message of
[1:05:18] the hour that James and Paul are looking
[1:05:20] at Abraham but from two different
[1:05:22] aspects Right? Because James was God
[1:05:25] anointed James to look at Abraham to
[1:05:27] show it's his works. Right? But then
[1:05:30] Paul is looking from God's perspective
[1:05:32] which is the faith. So man sees works,
[1:05:35] God sees faith and works is faith
[1:05:38] expressed. Right? So the life you live
[1:05:40] is an expression of your faith. But you
[1:05:42] see there's a big complaint against the
[1:05:43] apostle Paul in this day saying,
[1:05:46] "Well, he's just in, you know, he just
[1:05:48] teaches a different gospel than the
[1:05:50] other disciples. He talks about grace
[1:05:52] and he talks about faith and you don't
[1:05:54] need works and all these different
[1:05:55] things. Why? But then he writes about
[1:05:57] Malesc. Why? Because he knew grace. I'm
[1:06:00] not saying the other disciples didn't.
[1:06:02] They're anointed to write what they
[1:06:03] wrote. They're all in balance, right?
[1:06:05] But people want to take out the grace of
[1:06:07] God and make it the works of man. Amen.
[1:06:10] And and I'm afraid we don't want to let
[1:06:12] that ever come into our ranks. Amen.
[1:06:15] Where it's not the works of man bring
[1:06:17] the message to fulfillment. Oh no. It's
[1:06:20] the grace of God that comes into your
[1:06:22] life and then brings the word into
[1:06:24] fulfillment. Amen. And I'm I'm so glad
[1:06:27] for that because it's God's strength and
[1:06:29] ability that causes the word to be
[1:06:31] fulfilled. It ain't my ability. My
[1:06:33] ability is extremely limited. His is
[1:06:36] unlimited. Amen. So now here he is. But
[1:06:39] then also there's another thing about
[1:06:41] Malesc because when Malesc comes there's
[1:06:43] always a body change. Amen. There's a
[1:06:45] there's a resurrection. Amen. us more.
[1:06:48] So, so the grace of God would bring
[1:06:49] Abraham all the way out of out of
[1:06:52] idolatry, take him through troubles with
[1:06:54] family and different things, and he'd
[1:06:56] bring him to a place of a body change to
[1:06:59] have the promised son. You see, because
[1:07:02] if if God just turned Abraham and Sarah
[1:07:05] young again, they would have been stuck
[1:07:07] in the same
[1:07:09] cycle. No children, because that's what
[1:07:11] they were when they were young. So God
[1:07:13] was going to make them young but do
[1:07:15] something far greater than just pulling
[1:07:17] back the time scale. Amen. Why? God was
[1:07:20] going to change their bodies that even
[1:07:23] at a very old age he was going to give
[1:07:24] them strength. Cuz you think about a
[1:07:26] woman who's nearly 100 years old having
[1:07:28] a child. Her heart will
[1:07:31] bust maybe in the first trimester or
[1:07:34] something because she can't, you know,
[1:07:35] her, you know, because there's more
[1:07:36] blood flowing in a woman's body when
[1:07:38] she's pregnant. All these things her
[1:07:39] heart would have given out. There's no
[1:07:41] way humanly she could have been able to
[1:07:43] carry the child. What? So what did God
[1:07:45] do? He changed her young again and he
[1:07:48] changed Abraham young again. Amen.
[1:07:50] Because they are both infertile, right?
[1:07:52] But he changed them young again and
[1:07:54] broke that cycle of infertility that the
[1:07:56] promise of God could be fulfilled in
[1:07:58] their lives. Amen. As so so what
[1:08:00] happened? Mazdc came to Abraham to give
[1:08:02] them a body change.
[1:08:05] Hallelujah. David wrote in the Psalms, I
[1:08:08] will not suffer. Yeah. I'll not leave
[1:08:10] thy soul in hell, nor nor suffer to see
[1:08:13] my holy one to see corruption. What he
[1:08:15] was speaking about a rapture, a
[1:08:18] resurrection, a body change. Amen. Why?
[1:08:21] Because he came under the same anointing
[1:08:23] that Abraham did about Malchzdc. And you
[1:08:26] know, if you take the Apostle Paul out
[1:08:28] of the Gospels, there's no rapture.
[1:08:30] There's no change in the twinkling of an
[1:08:32] eye. Who wrote about that? The Apostle
[1:08:33] Paul. What about the three-fold rapture?
[1:08:35] The, you know, the Lord himself shall
[1:08:36] ascend with a shout of voice, a trump,
[1:08:38] and all these things. Paul wrote that.
[1:08:40] So if you take the Apostle Paul out of
[1:08:42] the scripture, you ain't got no rapture,
[1:08:45] you got no resurrection. Amen. But the
[1:08:47] reason he wrote about these things is
[1:08:49] because why? He had a visitation of
[1:08:51] Malchazdc, Jesus Christ. Amen. So he
[1:08:54] could write about those things.
[1:08:56] Hallelujah. Amen. Another thing, another
[1:09:00] thing that um Abraham Abraham was told
[1:09:03] by
[1:09:04] God, God revealed to him as
[1:09:07] Elshadai and Elshadai means the bosom or
[1:09:10] the mother who nurses her fretting
[1:09:12] child, breastfeeds her to health, uh
[1:09:14] breastfeeds the baby to health. So God
[1:09:17] God reveals himself to to Abraham as the
[1:09:20] breasted God saying just feed off me,
[1:09:22] draw from my promise and you'll draw
[1:09:25] strength. Amen. So the same malesc
[1:09:27] because it's the same god. It's not
[1:09:29] different gods that speak to Abraham. We
[1:09:30] know it's the same God.
[1:09:33] He's saying look I've given you a
[1:09:34] promise and this is how you're going to
[1:09:36] fulfill the promise is draw strength
[1:09:38] from me. Don't draw strength from your
[1:09:41] thinking or your ability or what you
[1:09:44] think you are in your humanity. Just
[1:09:46] draw on the promise. That's why I think
[1:09:48] brother Isaac said brother Ara's theme
[1:09:50] song was only believe. Like Jesus said,
[1:09:53] only believe all things are possible. So
[1:09:56] if you only believe, you're not
[1:09:58] believing and doing something else,
[1:10:00] right? You're only believing. You're
[1:10:02] only taking God at his word, right?
[1:10:04] You're not bringing in your own ideas.
[1:10:06] You're where you think you are, what
[1:10:08] you're going through. You're just
[1:10:10] believing his promise. Amen. Just like
[1:10:13] the Lord said to Abraham, "Nurse off me
[1:10:16] and you'll get strength. Draw strength
[1:10:18] out of the promise I've given you."
[1:10:20] That's why it's so important you go
[1:10:22] through something, Lord. Reveal your
[1:10:25] word to me. Cuz this is how you're going
[1:10:27] to have victory. Anchor your word into
[1:10:29] my heart. Lord, whatever I'm going
[1:10:30] through, Lord. There'll be someone in
[1:10:32] the scripture that has gone through it
[1:10:34] before. Right? And so what you do is as
[1:10:38] you're reading the word, you're
[1:10:39] listening to the message, say, "Lord,
[1:10:40] reveal to me where I am." Because when
[1:10:43] you know where you are, you know the
[1:10:45] victory can be won. Right? And then what
[1:10:48] happens? is then you begin to draw
[1:10:49] strength out of that character. Amen.
[1:10:52] Sometimes you might read about Abraham,
[1:10:54] you get nothing out of it. Then you're
[1:10:56] going through something, you find
[1:10:57] yourself in Genesis and it's like you're
[1:10:59] stepping in his footsteps. Amen. Where
[1:11:02] where you see your failures, you see the
[1:11:03] failure of your own humanity and all
[1:11:05] these things and problems and cycles and
[1:11:07] things, but then God comes, you say,
[1:11:09] "Draw strength from me." You don't draw
[1:11:11] strength out of fear or failures or
[1:11:13] problems. You draw strength out of my
[1:11:15] word.
[1:11:16] Amen. And then what happened? He drew
[1:11:18] that he he drew that strength out of the
[1:11:21] promise that he gave him. Amen. I'm sure
[1:11:23] you've all can all relate to these
[1:11:25] things that I'm talking to. See See the
[1:11:26] devil doesn't want you to draw draw
[1:11:28] strength out of the word of God. He does
[1:11:30] not want you to draw strength out of
[1:11:32] that, you know, but draw strength out of
[1:11:34] his word. Amen. So he turned he turned
[1:11:37] Abraham and Sarah young again. And I can
[1:11:39] say that because after this happened,
[1:11:42] they went down into they went down into
[1:11:45] Gera. Uh I'm not going to read this
[1:11:47] whole thing, but you know after after
[1:11:48] this in the story um they go down into
[1:11:51] Gera and the king of uh the Philistines
[1:11:54] were you know king of Gera saw Sarah and
[1:11:56] said I want to marry her. Here comes
[1:11:59] grandma. Here comes grand. Now you just
[1:12:02] think about this this see this you know
[1:12:04] you just think about this for a second.
[1:12:06] Here's the king. He wants to have he
[1:12:09] wants to have sons to continue his line.
[1:12:11] He wants to have a royal household. She
[1:12:14] wants to get the beautifulstlest
[1:12:15] princess, whoever. And then he sees
[1:12:18] grandma coming down with grandpa out of
[1:12:20] Israel, out of the promised land. Says,
[1:12:22] "I want to marry her to have
[1:12:24] children." No, she had been changed
[1:12:27] young again. That when the king saw her,
[1:12:29] she said, uh, he said, "She's a young,
[1:12:31] beautiful woman." Why? Cuz God had
[1:12:34] changed them with a
[1:12:35] visitation. Amen. And you know, you
[1:12:38] know, I'm just going to jump maybe way
[1:12:40] to the end, but brother Brandon preaches
[1:12:42] a sermon. Who is this malesc? He shows
[1:12:44] who he is. He He says, "Who is this?"
[1:12:46] Not who he was. Who is he right now?
[1:12:49] Amen. He says that he became Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ. And he says, "Now the same
[1:12:53] picture of Genesis 18 has repeated in
[1:12:55] this day in this Abrahamic age that we
[1:12:58] live in." Amen. He says, "Look, we're
[1:13:00] living in the days of Abraham because
[1:13:02] I'll show you now." I say, "If I've told
[1:13:04] the truth, let him come now and prove
[1:13:05] it's true." And he says, "Look, this is
[1:13:07] just the same as in Abraham's day. God
[1:13:09] came down, revealed Sarah's thoughts,
[1:13:11] you know, and Sarah was in the tent
[1:13:12] behind him. So, he says in a few places,
[1:13:14] I'll turn my back. And then God begins
[1:13:17] to show him what's wrong with people,
[1:13:18] what they're going through, all these
[1:13:19] things. Just like God knew the thoughts
[1:13:21] of Sarah's heart in the tent behind him
[1:13:23] in Genesis 18. And and and Brother Ram's
[1:13:26] not not making a show. He's not trying
[1:13:28] to entertain. He's trying to show you,
[1:13:30] look, I've talked about it, but this is
[1:13:31] the reality of it. And I'll show you
[1:13:33] through my ministry that Jesus Christ
[1:13:36] MKZDC is here. Amen. to give you a body
[1:13:38] change. Amen. To awaken faith. Amen.
[1:13:41] That you will see this message is right.
[1:13:43] Amen. It's more than doctrine. It's more
[1:13:45] than a nice idea. But it's calling sons
[1:13:47] and daughters of God into their
[1:13:49] position. Just like God called Abraham.
[1:13:51] He's here to call you. That same God
[1:13:53] isn't in history only. He's present here
[1:13:55] right now. Amen. To call you, awaken
[1:13:57] you. Amen. That you realize I am a son
[1:14:00] and daughter or daughter of God. Amen.
[1:14:02] So he turned his back. Begin to call
[1:14:04] people out. Specific exact. It's not
[1:14:06] someone behind me. he's got a bad knee
[1:14:08] or a bad day or a bad back. No, it was
[1:14:10] you sir or you lady. This with you with
[1:14:12] the dress on all these things. And God
[1:14:15] did that to show you that this message
[1:14:18] is Jesus Christ revealed. Amen. Now, the
[1:14:21] Bible says in Hebrews that he is the
[1:14:23] high priest, right? If you have the high
[1:14:26] priest, you have the blood. If you have
[1:14:29] the high priest, you have a go between
[1:14:32] you and God. So, you've got an advocate.
[1:14:34] You've got someone to stand in the gap
[1:14:36] for you. You got an intercessor. You got
[1:14:38] a mediator. If you have the high priest,
[1:14:40] if you don't have the high priest, you
[1:14:41] don't have none of that. You can have
[1:14:42] the temple. You You astound me. I think
[1:14:45] of it you often, you know, Jesus is
[1:14:47] dying on Calvary and God rents the veil
[1:14:50] from top to bottom. What was in
[1:14:53] there? Well, the ark wasn't there. Maybe
[1:14:56] a replica, but the genuine thing, was it
[1:14:58] an empty room? I don't know. But the
[1:15:00] thing is, the mercy seat was hanging on
[1:15:02] Calvary, brother Bram says, right? But
[1:15:04] the thing is, right, you know, they
[1:15:05] didn't have what they needed to atone
[1:15:07] for the sins of the people anymore,
[1:15:10] right? And it's the same thing with
[1:15:11] denomination. If you have the word, you
[1:15:13] have the high priest, right? If you have
[1:15:15] the truth of God's word, you have the
[1:15:17] high priest because God is a high priest
[1:15:19] over his own word. Amen. He is the
[1:15:22] priest over his own word. That's why
[1:15:23] it's so important. Quote the word. Amen.
[1:15:27] Quote his promises. Don't quote your
[1:15:29] problems. Quote, Well, sure, you can
[1:15:31] tell him your problems. He wants to hear
[1:15:32] everything about it. But don't let that
[1:15:33] be the end of your sentence. Amen. You
[1:15:35] say, "Well, Lord, I'm going through
[1:15:37] this. Lord, I need a job." Or, "Lord, I
[1:15:40] need you to provide, but God, you're
[1:15:42] Jehovah Gyra." Amen. God, you said in
[1:15:45] your word, you've never I, you know,
[1:15:47] David would say, "I'm I'm old. I was
[1:15:49] young. Now I'm old, but I've never seen
[1:15:50] thy seed forsaken northern than begging
[1:15:53] bread." Amen. So, what is he saying? So,
[1:15:55] you begin to quote that back to God. And
[1:15:57] God says, "Now I can act upon your
[1:15:59] profession because you are quoting my
[1:16:01] word back to me." Amen. And I love my
[1:16:04] word to be quoted back to me.
[1:16:06] Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] Glory to God. Amen. This is so
[1:16:09] important. You take the word and you
[1:16:11] quote it in prayer back to God. Does it
[1:16:14] have to be verbatim? No, not
[1:16:15] necessarily. But he sees your heart
[1:16:17] because he's put your his word in your
[1:16:18] heart. Amen. So, we're going to call
[1:16:20] upon God. So, tell him your problems,
[1:16:21] but tell him the solution in terms of
[1:16:23] God, this is your promise. How you
[1:16:25] fulfill it, God, it's up to you. But
[1:16:27] you're a God of your word. I'm standing
[1:16:28] on your word. I'm a Christian. I mean, I
[1:16:30] believe your word, God. So now, if you
[1:16:32] have the word, you've got the high
[1:16:35] priest. You got some. You got the blood
[1:16:37] that testifies for you, that stands for
[1:16:39] you. If you have the high priest,
[1:16:41] because without a high priest, you can't
[1:16:42] have blood offered on your behalf. Amen.
[1:16:44] Like Israel that was outside that wasn't
[1:16:47] the high priest. They were helpless
[1:16:49] until the high priest went in once a
[1:16:51] year with the blood. They couldn't do it
[1:16:53] themselves. They weren't called to that
[1:16:55] position. They needed someone who was
[1:16:56] ordained, that was called, that was
[1:16:59] dressed right, that was built right,
[1:17:01] anointed right with the blood that God
[1:17:04] gave, ordained to take it into the Holy
[1:17:06] of Holies. And now we have a high
[1:17:08] priest, our Lord Jesus Christ. He was
[1:17:11] called, he was built, right, virgin, son
[1:17:14] of God, Emmanuel, God made flesh. The
[1:17:18] blood of Jesus, the the blood of God was
[1:17:20] shed on Calvary is more than a Jew.
[1:17:22] Wasn't a Gentile. He was God, Emmanuel
[1:17:24] made flesh. Amen. So he was built right.
[1:17:27] He was called. He was dressed right as a
[1:17:30] sacrifice. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. He
[1:17:34] was anointed right. Amen.
[1:17:37] How Hallelujah. And what did he do? He
[1:17:41] did that on your behalf.
[1:17:43] Amen. Grace knows someone who's called
[1:17:46] by grace, grace knows they can't atone
[1:17:48] for their own sin. They cannot make
[1:17:50] anything right in their own ability.
[1:17:52] Those who are in this grace covenant
[1:17:53] realize, Lord, I can't fix nothing. But
[1:17:56] God, you're the fixer. You're the men.
[1:17:58] You're the restorer, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:18:01] Amen. Hallelujah. So Jesus, we know, he
[1:18:04] rose triumphant over hell, death, and
[1:18:05] the grave. Amen. And then, and then when
[1:18:07] Mary went to touch him or you, you know,
[1:18:10] there at the tomb, he says, "Don't touch
[1:18:11] me, for I've not
[1:18:13] ascended." Hallelujah. But I'm going to
[1:18:15] ascend to my father, your father, my
[1:18:17] God, and your God. what he had to do. He
[1:18:19] had to he had to be he had to be
[1:18:21] accepted. Hallelujah. And the proof he
[1:18:24] was accepted is the Holy Ghost came down
[1:18:26] on the day of Pentecost. Amen. To prove
[1:18:28] that his blood atoned, cleansed the
[1:18:30] people in the upper room, the murderers,
[1:18:32] adulterers, fornicators, whatever they
[1:18:34] were, idolattors, whatever they were in
[1:18:36] the upper room, God cleansed them. Amen.
[1:18:38] Cuz the blood, Amen, wipes off every
[1:18:41] single stain. Hallelujah. Not just part
[1:18:43] of it, not just a little bit, every
[1:18:45] single stain. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother
[1:18:49] Ram says it's like a abstract title. You
[1:18:51] know, it's a title search. So, it's like
[1:18:53] a piece of ground if you, you know, you
[1:18:54] can only buy a piece of property if
[1:18:56] there's no claims. If there's claims on
[1:18:58] it by someone else, that's got to be
[1:18:59] resolved. And once it's resolved, then
[1:19:02] the purchase can be made. Amen. So, the
[1:19:04] devil had claims on you and I first.
[1:19:08] I've done a lot of bad in my life. It's
[1:19:09] because of your first birth he did it.
[1:19:12] Amen. But the Lord had to wipe off his
[1:19:14] claims, which he did by his own blood.
[1:19:18] broke. Amen. Yeah. Hallelujah. Amen. Our
[1:19:20] first nature is not just put away in a
[1:19:23] cupboard somewhere. It's destroyed. He's
[1:19:25] dead. Amen. That we can be united to
[1:19:27] another, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:29] Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] Amen. So, Amen. So, so, so, so brother
[1:19:36] says in the day of Pentecost when the
[1:19:37] Holy Ghost came down, he said because
[1:19:40] God did a thorough cleansing of the deed
[1:19:43] of the people to to to wipe away every
[1:19:46] claim the devil could ever put on their
[1:19:48] lives, God struck it off completely.
[1:19:51] Amen. Not just covered, Amen. totally
[1:19:53] struck off. And then the Holy Ghost came
[1:19:55] and dwelt in them, showing that they
[1:19:57] were his his purchased possession.
[1:20:00] Hallelujah. And then what did he do
[1:20:02] before that? 10 days before the day of
[1:20:03] Pentecost, he ascended on high. He's
[1:20:05] interceding over his own word now.
[1:20:07] That's why it's so important. Speak his
[1:20:10] word back to him. Hallelujah. Amen. But
[1:20:13] then now he comes down in the end time.
[1:20:15] Now I'm jumping 2,000 years to this day.
[1:20:18] Amen. And then brother Rams sent to the
[1:20:20] earth. That ministry says I'm I'm just a
[1:20:22] man like you. Which he was. Amen. Saved
[1:20:28] by the same blood saved you. Filled with
[1:20:30] the same Holy Ghost that filled you.
[1:20:32] Amen. Saved by grace just like you just
[1:20:34] had a prophetic office that God used,
[1:20:36] right? And then what happened? God
[1:20:38] stepped into him to reveal Jesus Christ.
[1:20:41] Reveal Mchzc once again to show that
[1:20:44] this is the high priest revealing
[1:20:46] himself. Amen. That this is the pure
[1:20:48] word of God. Because if you got the pure
[1:20:50] word, now this is to me this is not
[1:20:52] mental gymnastics, right? Because if you
[1:20:54] have the pure word, then you have the
[1:20:56] high priest, then you have the blood.
[1:21:00] Without those things. So if you add
[1:21:02] creeds of man and ideas of man, you
[1:21:04] don't have the blood anymore. You don't
[1:21:06] have the high priest. But if you come
[1:21:07] back to the pure word of God and that's
[1:21:09] why brother Ram always says that every
[1:21:11] revival through history is when man gets
[1:21:13] back to the word. Amen. They leave their
[1:21:16] ideas, leave their traditions, they come
[1:21:18] back to the word and a revival begins to
[1:21:20] take place. Why? Because they come back
[1:21:22] to what God has allotted for that age
[1:21:24] and then he steps in and vindicates it
[1:21:26] because why? They have the high priest
[1:21:28] once again.
[1:21:30] Praise the Lord. You're a blessed
[1:21:32] people. Amen. You're a very blessed
[1:21:34] people to think that God is your high
[1:21:35] priest. Amen. Not just I hope he is or I
[1:21:37] heard he is. You know he is. Amen. Why?
[1:21:40] Because he came down and filled you with
[1:21:41] his presence. Amen. To prove Amen. that
[1:21:43] he is your high priest. Amen. And he is
[1:21:46] making intercession on your behalf every
[1:21:48] day. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so thankful for
[1:21:52] that. Aren't you? Like brother Bram when
[1:21:53] he went into that diner that time and he
[1:21:55] saw this old woman with blue or whatever
[1:21:57] here and carousing with a with a cop and
[1:21:59] all this stuff going on and brother Bram
[1:22:01] saw that just condemned her saying how
[1:22:03] on earth God can you put up with this in
[1:22:04] this earth and you're going to take this
[1:22:06] out and but then God pulled him to one
[1:22:08] side listen I want I need to talk to you
[1:22:10] and then God showed him a vision of the
[1:22:12] earth and then this blood curtain around
[1:22:14] the earth and then these black streaks
[1:22:16] going up and Jesus is there in that
[1:22:17] blood and all the black streaks coming
[1:22:19] up from the earth and striking striking
[1:22:21] him and he's saying and You know, the
[1:22:22] Lord would say, "Father, forgive them.
[1:22:23] They don't know what they do." And the
[1:22:25] and and those black streaks with the sin
[1:22:27] could not get past the blood of the Lord
[1:22:28] Jesus. And then the Lord said, "Look,
[1:22:30] that's just your sins causing that to
[1:22:33] happen to me."
[1:22:36] He says, "Lord, I'm sorry. Sorry. I
[1:22:38] condemn that woman." And actually goes
[1:22:40] up to her and said, "Look, this is what
[1:22:42] I thought, but this is what God showed
[1:22:43] me." Amen. What? And actually
[1:22:45] compassion, the the the compassion of
[1:22:47] God could come into his life because he
[1:22:50] saw his position. But then he saw God's
[1:22:52] position. Amen. He could see Jesus'
[1:22:54] position as a buffer for his life.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah. Then he could step into her
[1:23:00] need and God saved her and whoever was
[1:23:03] with her. Why? Because he could see
[1:23:05] things clearly.
[1:23:07] I pray we catch a vision of that today.
[1:23:10] Can you all this world and Sodom and
[1:23:11] Gomorrah? What about your sin?
[1:23:14] What about what we do?
[1:23:17] Amen. But if we confess our sins, he's
[1:23:18] faithful and just to forgive us. Amen.
[1:23:21] But we should never have an attitude
[1:23:22] that you know this world deserves
[1:23:24] judgment. I said Lord see because when
[1:23:27] God got into Abraham's life he could
[1:23:31] intercede after the visitation of
[1:23:33] Genesis 18. He could intercede for Lot.
[1:23:35] He could intercede for Sodom. Amen. We
[1:23:38] all know the story, don't we? God says
[1:23:40] because when the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:23:42] your life, he says I'm going to show you
[1:23:44] things that are going to come to pass.
[1:23:46] Right? And so God said to Abraham, or
[1:23:49] maybe said to himself, he says out loud
[1:23:51] basically, "Can I withhold from my
[1:23:53] friend what I'm going to do before
[1:23:56] Sodom's destroyed, he begins to talk to
[1:23:58] Abraham." Say, "Abraham, this is what
[1:24:00] I'm going to do. I'm going to destroy
[1:24:02] this place because of the sin that's
[1:24:04] come up before me." And so now Abraham,
[1:24:07] because he's under that grace covenant
[1:24:09] now, and because he's met Melisedc, he
[1:24:11] can intercede cuz God wants someone to
[1:24:14] intercede on the earth. It's not just in
[1:24:16] heaven. Sure, he's our high priest, but
[1:24:18] he needs someone to manifest that
[1:24:20] intercession through. And so, and so
[1:24:23] Abraham begins to speak to him because
[1:24:25] because God Abraham knows God. He's
[1:24:28] standing in the presence of the fountain
[1:24:30] of grace that called him. It's now in
[1:24:32] flesh talking to him. And he knows that
[1:24:34] it's only it's only because of God's
[1:24:36] will that he's been called. And God's
[1:24:38] changed his life because only the will
[1:24:39] of God. It wasn't even Abraham's will.
[1:24:41] It was God's will. So now we stand there
[1:24:43] before this fountain of mercy saying
[1:24:45] who's who's turning into judgment
[1:24:47] because it's part of his character. And
[1:24:49] then God, you know, I mean Abraham says
[1:24:51] to God, "God, if you find 50 righteous
[1:24:53] in the city, will you save it?" And the
[1:24:56] number goes down and down and down. Why?
[1:25:00] Cuz Abraham is standing there as an
[1:25:02] intercessor. And if he went down to
[1:25:05] three or two or one, God would have
[1:25:10] saved the whole thing. But you see, God
[1:25:13] got Abraham in a position to
[1:25:16] intercede. How about you and I?
[1:25:20] Amen. I'm just actually telling you who
[1:25:21] you already are. We got to realize that
[1:25:24] you've got a very important place on
[1:25:27] this earth right now in this Abrahamic
[1:25:30] age. Amen. Before where our bodies are
[1:25:33] changed, we meet the Lord in the air.
[1:25:34] Amen. You have a very important position
[1:25:37] to intercede, to call out, say, "God,
[1:25:40] there must be more in this place than
[1:25:42] just
[1:25:44] this." Amen. There's got to be more. You
[1:25:46] say, "Well, what if they're not called
[1:25:47] to the message?" That don't matter.
[1:25:50] As long as, you know, if we can just
[1:25:51] help someone on their way, not
[1:25:53] everyone's bride, but there's church,
[1:25:55] you know, there's there's lots out
[1:25:58] there. There's lots of lots out there,
[1:26:00] right? They may never come to the
[1:26:01] revelation that you have, but you can
[1:26:03] help them on their journey. You know,
[1:26:04] those who are just caught up in, you
[1:26:06] know, trying to make New Zealand great
[1:26:08] again and so fixated on trying to help
[1:26:10] the world and restore it and make it
[1:26:12] Christian again, all these things. The
[1:26:14] only way that'll happen is when the
[1:26:15] beast takes over in Revelations. Won't
[1:26:17] be true Christianity, that's for sure.
[1:26:19] But you see, there's people who are just
[1:26:20] so paralyzed by sin. And so like like
[1:26:23] Lot, it says that what was going on
[1:26:25] there vexed his righteous soul, but he
[1:26:27] couldn't even his witness was nullled by
[1:26:31] it. There's people like that we can
[1:26:34] encourage. Amen. You can encourage
[1:26:36] someone on their way. They can have just
[1:26:38] a foot closer to God. They can be maybe
[1:26:40] pulled out that just love the Lord
[1:26:41] again. You can. God wants to use you to
[1:26:44] do that. You say, "Is that worth it?"
[1:26:46] Absolutely. Oh, but they're not going in
[1:26:48] the rapture. God has different people.
[1:26:51] Amen. Why are we just looking at the
[1:26:52] bride and the bride only? We're here to
[1:26:54] minister to all types. Amen. When when
[1:26:56] our Lord Jesus was here, he ministered
[1:26:58] to the centurion. He ministered to the
[1:27:01] scribes and Pharisees who who needed
[1:27:03] help. He ministered to all different
[1:27:04] kinds of people. Multitudes were healed
[1:27:07] by him. He didn't stop and say, "Now
[1:27:09] listen, are you going to be in the upper
[1:27:12] room? Are you part of this New Testament
[1:27:15] church I'm building? Are you going to
[1:27:17] believe this? You got to believe this
[1:27:18] first." No, he didn't. when they they
[1:27:21] had faith, they got what they needed,
[1:27:23] they went on their way. Your father, you
[1:27:25] understand, right? We're here to
[1:27:26] minister to
[1:27:29] everyone. Praise the Lord. Same with
[1:27:31] Brother Bram. He prayed for woman
[1:27:32] preachers. He prayed for all different
[1:27:34] kind of everyone. He didn't condemn them
[1:27:36] for what they were. He just said,
[1:27:37] "You're a woman preacher in the prayer
[1:27:39] line. Pray for them whatever their need
[1:27:40] was." Who's heard that? Who's read that?
[1:27:43] Right? It's against the word. But he
[1:27:44] didn't condemn them. He just he entered
[1:27:46] into their need. He prayed for them and
[1:27:48] then they went on their way. What' they
[1:27:50] become? I don't know. But God ministered
[1:27:52] to them through him. The same God in him
[1:27:55] is in you. Amen. That same Mazdc is in
[1:27:58] you, Jesus Christ. Right? He hasn't
[1:28:01] changed one bit.
[1:28:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just go. Okay,
[1:28:07] I'm going to show another picture and
[1:28:09] then we're going to go.
[1:28:13] Okay, there's a difference between a
[1:28:15] mule and a horse. This is a total segue,
[1:28:16] but hey, we're
[1:28:19] segueing. A mule can outwork a horse any
[1:28:22] day. Stronger, got more endurance, can
[1:28:26] work, do a lot more work. Now, we know a
[1:28:28] mule is a hybrid between a donkey and a
[1:28:29] horse, right? We know that. Okay? So,
[1:28:31] they're stronger, more agile. I mean,
[1:28:33] you know, they can just work and work
[1:28:34] and work. And if you look at if you look
[1:28:37] at people, you know, you know, there's
[1:28:38] Christians in this world who are more
[1:28:40] devout than you and I. I'm not saying
[1:28:43] that to beat you down, okay? I'm not
[1:28:44] saying that at I just want you to know
[1:28:46] they are more devout than you, but they
[1:28:48] don't walk in the in a in a grace
[1:28:51] covenant like you do.
[1:28:54] Okay? You say, "Well, they are mules."
[1:28:57] Nothing against them. They have their
[1:28:59] place, right? But the difference between
[1:29:01] a But the thing is, if you're looking at
[1:29:02] the wrong thing, you'll wear you'll beat
[1:29:04] yourself up. Well, I don't pray as much
[1:29:06] as that person. That person denomination
[1:29:08] just they pray all this and they do this
[1:29:10] and what about me and I'm just nothing.
[1:29:13] You're comparing yourself with the wrong
[1:29:14] thing. Right? Because a mule may be able
[1:29:17] to outwork a horse, but a horse, a real
[1:29:20] genuine horse knows its pedigree. Amen.
[1:29:23] It knows its mommy and daddy. Amen. It
[1:29:25] knows its lineage. It's got document.
[1:29:27] Well, not the horse, but the owner would
[1:29:28] have documentation, right? If it's a
[1:29:31] thorough bread. Amen. We can trace it
[1:29:32] lineage back to show that it's pure.
[1:29:35] Okay. Now, we have a lineage as well. We
[1:29:37] have documentation to prove of what we
[1:29:40] are. It could be a thoroughbred horse.
[1:29:42] It could be as weak and no stamina as
[1:29:44] nothing. It's still a thoroughbred
[1:29:46] horse, right? So don't don't beat
[1:29:49] yourself up saying, "Well, I'm not
[1:29:50] working. I'm not doing using this enough
[1:29:54] to further the kingdom." You know what
[1:29:56] you do to further the kingdom? Love the
[1:29:59] Lord. Oh, that's too easy. That's too
[1:30:01] simple. God isn't simplicity. You want
[1:30:04] someone to want what you have, love the
[1:30:07] Lord.
[1:30:08] Be like the little baby bear cub that
[1:30:10] got in the molasses gel in brother Ram's
[1:30:12] hunting. You be like that. They love the
[1:30:14] molasses. I don't know any little child
[1:30:16] that does not like a sweet and some
[1:30:18] little children don't grow up and they
[1:30:20] still love
[1:30:21] it. But you see that little cub got in
[1:30:24] there, wrecked the whole tent, got into
[1:30:26] that jar and basically got covered in
[1:30:28] molasses, right? And then what happened?
[1:30:30] It, you know, the mother called it.
[1:30:31] Finally the cub came or I don't know if
[1:30:33] the mother yanked it out the tent. I
[1:30:35] don't know. But anyway, the thing is
[1:30:37] that mother grabbed that cub and then
[1:30:39] and then it sibling and the mom begin to
[1:30:40] lick all the molasses off the one that
[1:30:42] got covered with it. Why? Because they
[1:30:45] wanted what it got caught up into. Amen.
[1:30:48] It was that that cup in its state and
[1:30:50] it's covered in molasses. Probably got
[1:30:52] more molasses on it than in it. I don't
[1:30:54] know. You know, it was the greatest
[1:30:55] advertising to its family that the
[1:30:58] molasses is wonderful. It fell in love
[1:31:01] with molasses.
[1:31:03] Fall in love with Jesus.
[1:31:06] And you will you'll be a billboard
[1:31:08] or fall in love with him again.
[1:31:12] There'll be a joy that's supernatural.
[1:31:14] There'll be a peace that is supernatural
[1:31:17] that just flows out of your life and
[1:31:19] people say, "I want to begin licking on
[1:31:21] that. What is that? What do you believe?
[1:31:23] Where do you
[1:31:24] go?" Amen. Praise the Lord. So the horse
[1:31:28] has a has a lineage. It knows where it
[1:31:31] came from. Amen. And we have a lineage
[1:31:34] too. You know, brother Bram says that
[1:31:36] that we have representation in heaven,
[1:31:39] right? Now I'm just putting this in.
[1:31:41] This is this is the after the service.
[1:31:44] This is all, you know, whatever. But the
[1:31:45] thing is this horse, I mean, we have
[1:31:47] representation in heaven. It doesn't
[1:31:49] matter what we look like on the outside.
[1:31:51] It's what's on the inside that counts.
[1:31:53] Now, Brother Bram says that the woman at
[1:31:55] the well, the difference between the
[1:31:56] woman at the well and the scribe and
[1:31:58] Pharisee is one had representation in
[1:32:00] heaven. The other did not. Amen. So now
[1:32:03] the woman at the well had representation
[1:32:04] in heaven, a theophony, right? So when
[1:32:08] she saw the Messiah do what he did, she
[1:32:12] said, "You're the Messiah." Right?
[1:32:14] Because she had representation in
[1:32:16] heaven. She was a real thoroughbred
[1:32:18] horse. But you see the scribes and
[1:32:19] Pharisees when they saw Jesus do the
[1:32:21] same things, they said, "Well, you're
[1:32:23] Belzeub." Because they did not have
[1:32:25] representation in heaven. Amen. So what
[1:32:28] does this message show you? I have
[1:32:30] representation in heaven. Why has it
[1:32:33] gripped you? Why do you believe what you
[1:32:35] believe? Why have you given your life to
[1:32:37] it? Why do you want to serve the Lord in
[1:32:39] this capacity? Why? Because God has
[1:32:42] shown you you have representation in
[1:32:44] heaven. And if you're under a grace
[1:32:46] covenant, which you are, you realize you
[1:32:49] did not put it there.
[1:32:52] God put it there before the foundation
[1:32:54] of the world. Amen. You didn't put it
[1:32:56] there. You didn't earn it and put it
[1:32:57] there. God put it there.
[1:33:00] Amen. Let's just finish with this one
[1:33:03] scripture. Let's have the musicians,
[1:33:04] please. I feel like I'm just kind of
[1:33:05] wandering around on my merry
[1:33:07] way. But he says here now, God is not a
[1:33:11] man that he should lie, neither the son
[1:33:13] of man that he should repent. Hath he
[1:33:15] said and shall not uh shall not do it?
[1:33:18] Or hath he spoken and shall he not make
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:21] good? Has he not spoken? Shall he not
[1:33:24] make it good? Shall he not prove his
[1:33:27] word? I'm just want to finish with this
[1:33:28] cuz we realize God, if you called me by
[1:33:31] your grace, you're going to fulfill your
[1:33:33] word that you've promised
[1:33:35] me. Thy family shall be saved. We're
[1:33:38] going in a rapture. Amen. Every cycle
[1:33:41] will be broken. Amen. You got to realize
[1:33:44] God has ordained that every enemy will
[1:33:46] be under your feet. Doesn't matter how
[1:33:48] deep it is in your life, how much it's
[1:33:50] in your subconscious. That thing is
[1:33:52] going. Amen. That thing is not staying.
[1:33:54] It is going. Amen. Like everything in
[1:33:56] Abraham's life was driven out by God cuz
[1:33:58] God wanted to use him as a testimony and
[1:34:01] God wants to use you as a testimony
[1:34:03] also. So you got to look at your enemy,
[1:34:05] whatever you're facing, whatever
[1:34:06] whatever it is you say, you ain't
[1:34:08] welcome no more.
[1:34:10] This has come to an end and it's not
[1:34:13] coming back around again. It's done.
[1:34:16] Hallelujah. Don't put up with it. The
[1:34:18] devil wants to say, "Well, I'm part of
[1:34:20] you. You can't get rid of me."
[1:34:23] Yeah, we can.
[1:34:26] Yeah, we can. Yeah, we have. Who's the
[1:34:29] king of your life? Satan ain't the king
[1:34:31] of your life. He was. You were born with
[1:34:33] him on your throne. But you got rid of
[1:34:36] him. How did you get rid of him, Lord?
[1:34:38] Thank you for your blood, Lord. Thank
[1:34:40] you for Calvary, Lord. Come, come be my
[1:34:43] Lord and Savior. He got dethroned. God
[1:34:46] stepped in. Hallelujah. Maybe he went
[1:34:49] through cycles trying to please God,
[1:34:51] trying to do all kinds of things like I
[1:34:53] did. But I came to a point where I
[1:34:54] realized, Lord, you got to do a work. I
[1:34:57] give it all, Lord.
[1:34:59] And he does it. So if the devil says,
[1:35:02] "You can't get rid of me." Well, he's
[1:35:04] already out of there. Hallelujah. What
[1:35:07] about the human spirit? Oh, he's going
[1:35:08] out of there, too. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[1:35:12] ain't staying. He ain't welcome. And he
[1:35:14] ain't going with you when you go. Oh,
[1:35:16] you have to. Oh, yeah. But we're going
[1:35:17] to fight him every day of our life, and
[1:35:19] it's just going to stay this way till we
[1:35:20] leave. No, we will fight him, but it's
[1:35:24] not going to be just this stagnant
[1:35:26] warfare like Russia and Ukraine just now
[1:35:29] just grinding on. Nothing's really
[1:35:30] happening. No, no, no. Christianity is
[1:35:33] just a
[1:35:34] blitzkrieg of victory. You look at
[1:35:36] Joshua. I you know I haven't I was what
[1:35:38] about four years they took the whole
[1:35:40] land. They could have done it earlier
[1:35:41] than that, right? Yeah. It was just
[1:35:43] battle after battle. Big big victory
[1:35:46] after big victory. It wasn't a grind.
[1:35:49] They were led here. It's like you got to
[1:35:51] look into your life. There's things in
[1:35:53] your life, you know, there you want
[1:35:54] dealt with. You go to that thing. Go to
[1:35:56] that complex. Why am I detached? That's
[1:35:58] a stronghold. That's going. Amen. Why
[1:36:01] can I not, you know, why do I get so
[1:36:03] angry? I got this temper. That's another
[1:36:04] stronghold. Well, it's coming down, too.
[1:36:07] You don't just look at the things, oh
[1:36:08] yeah, they're there. No, no, no. I got a
[1:36:10] bulldozer of the Holy Ghost who's here
[1:36:12] to destroy every problem, every complex,
[1:36:15] every hurt, every situation. It's going
[1:36:17] down. Hallelujah. It's good to take
[1:36:20] inventory. Why do I Why do I flare up
[1:36:22] when a certain thing said that's a
[1:36:23] stronghold that's going down?
[1:36:26] Maybe maybe map out your land.
[1:36:30] Be reflective and say, "Lord, this is
[1:36:33] not this is contrary to your word, Lord.
[1:36:35] It's going
[1:36:36] out." Hallelujah. And then watch what
[1:36:41] happens. Praise the Lord. Amen. God is
[1:36:45] here to break every cycle. We live in
[1:36:47] this great Abrahamic age. Amen. Let's
[1:36:49] stand, shall we? Amen. What are you What
[1:36:51] are you stringing there, bro?
[1:36:56] Amen. Absolutely. I'm going to walk
[1:36:57] right up into a body change. I feel it
[1:37:00] coming on. And it might be

[1:37:31] was talking with the Lord and thinking
[1:37:33] how glorious heaven would
[1:37:37] be. Then he caught a revelation of a
[1:37:41] Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] translation. Earth couldn't hold him
[1:37:45] down. He walked right off the ground.
[1:37:48] I'm going to walk right up into a body

[1:38:11] listening to the Lord who told him,
[1:38:13] "Come over the Jordan, there will
[1:38:17] be." And then he looked up to the
[1:38:20] heavens, saw a chariot descending. It
[1:38:23] swept him off the ground and he was
[1:38:26] heaven bound. I'm going to walk right up

[1:39:47] change. Oh, I feel it coming on. And it
[1:39:51] might be today. I'm going to walk right
[1:39:55] up into

[1:45:30] king. Oh, the Assyrian army gathered
[1:45:34] round. Hezekiah walked up and looked
[1:45:38] around. All he saw as far as the eye
[1:45:42] could see was a sea of men.
[1:45:46] When the
[1:45:47] messengers came to him, he gave to them
[1:45:51] a ransom. But they said, "You have no
[1:45:54] more strength for war. Your counsel
[1:45:57] won't help you
[1:45:59] anymore. And all you people on the wall,
[1:46:04] hear what the great king say. Don't let
[1:46:08] his deceive you. God won't deliver
[1:46:12] today.
[1:46:14] Just look at every place we've been and
[1:46:18] every kingdom that we fought has been
[1:46:21] trotten under our
[1:46:24] feet. And you will be the same. And as
[1:46:28] the railings came up from the Assyrians,
[1:46:33] Hezekiah knelt down to his knees.
[1:46:39] He bowed his hands and he bowed his head
[1:46:42] and said, "Oh
[1:46:47] God, today is a day of
[1:46:50] trouble. Oh
[1:46:54] God, the child is come and there is no
[1:46:58] strength to bring
[1:47:01] forth. You're all my strength and you're
[1:47:04] all my deliverance.
[1:47:09] And I put my trust in
[1:47:12] you, oh
[1:47:16] God. Oh
[1:47:18] God. Cuz I have learned that in every
[1:47:25] situation, whatever I am
[1:47:28] facing, I put my trust in Jesus. And he
[1:47:33] won't put me to shame. Cuz I have
[1:47:37] learned that in every
[1:47:41] situation, whatever I am
[1:47:45] facing, I put my trust in
[1:47:49] Jesus and he won't put me to
[1:47:56] shame. Oh, go tell
[1:47:59] Hezekiah that his prayer has been heard.
[1:48:04] Behold, I send
[1:48:07] Isaiah. They thus sayeth the
[1:48:10] Lord. To the king of Syria, I say, who
[1:48:15] hast thou bless me the case? Was it not
[1:48:20] to the holy one of
[1:48:24] Israel? It may have spoke to
[1:48:28] his, but he put his trust in me.
[1:48:33] And the words you have spoken, my tears
[1:48:37] they have received, but I'll hear no
[1:48:43] more. The way you came is the way you
[1:48:46] go. Your shields won't come against this
[1:48:50] city. You'll not fire one
[1:48:54] arrow. You'll
[1:48:57] not against him at all. Thus saith the
[1:49:04] Lord, you will turn and you will go.
[1:49:08] Thus saith the
[1:49:10] Lord. Thus sayith the
[1:49:14] Lord. Cuz I have learned that in every
[1:49:21] situation, whatever I am
[1:49:24] facing, I put my trust in Jesus and he
[1:49:29] won't put me to shame. Cuz I have
[1:49:33] learned that in every
[1:49:37] situation. Whatever I am
[1:49:41] facing, I put my trust in Jesus.
[1:49:45] and he won't put
[1:49:47] me to shame. You're my shield cuz you're
[1:49:52] my shield and you're my buckler and your
[1:49:56] name is a strong tower. You're the
[1:50:00] shepherd of the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:05] death. And you prepare a table for me in
[1:50:11] the presence of
[1:50:13] my
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:17] enemy. You won't put
[1:50:20] me to
[1:50:24] shame. And when the morning sun
[1:50:28] arose, the air seems so quiet.
[1:50:33] is a kind look
[1:50:36] down. Oh, what a
[1:50:40] sign all over the
[1:50:43] fields right across the
[1:50:47] plains. The tents they all seem empty.
[1:50:51] There were no fires, no
[1:50:54] flames. Horses had no
[1:50:59] riders the same.
[1:51:03] dogs ahead. No masters, no
[1:51:07] Syrian
[1:51:09] remain. For the angel of the
[1:51:13] Lord went through the camp that
[1:51:17] night, slew our mighty
[1:51:20] host, and put the
[1:51:24] rest to
[1:51:28] fly. Cuz I have learned. Cuz I have
[1:51:32] learned that in every
[1:51:37] situation, whatever I am
[1:51:40] facing, I put my trust in Jesus and he
[1:51:45] won't put me to shame. Cuz I have
[1:51:49] learned that in every situation.
[1:51:55] Whatever I am
[1:51:57] facing, I put my trust in Jesus that he
[1:52:02] won't. Oh, I have learned. I have
[1:52:06] learned that in every
[1:52:11] situation, whatever I am
[1:52:14] facing, I put my trust in Jesus and he
[1:52:19] won't put me to shame. Cuz I have
[1:52:23] learned that in every
[1:52:28] situation, whatever I am
[1:52:31] facing, I put my trust in
[1:52:35] Jesus and he won't put
[1:52:38] me to
[1:52:41] shame.
[1:52:48] Amen. Amen. And I just want to finish up
[1:52:50] with one more song this
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:53:05] morning. Why would I worry when giants
[1:53:10] come calling my name?
[1:53:17] My God is so much bigger. The troubles I
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:26] face. Why would I hunger for power or
[1:53:31] riches or

[1:53:41] of these things.

[2:03:40] No one knew how alone I was
[2:03:46] feeling and the emptiness I tried so
[2:03:50] hard to
[2:03:53] hide. Though I lied, said my life was
[2:03:58] fine without
[2:04:00] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[2:04:05] I
[2:04:07] cried. Then one day, someone told me of
[2:04:12] your
[2:04:15] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[2:04:19] called Calvary.
[2:04:23] There
[2:04:25] you purchased my
[2:04:29] redemption. When you broke sin's power
[2:04:33] and set my spirit
[2:04:37] free, I'm
[2:04:40] amazed that you love me.
[2:04:45] I'm
[2:04:48] amazed how you
[2:04:51] care. Through your

[2:04:59] pardon. And my
[2:05:01] sins are
[2:05:03] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[2:05:09] sins are
[2:05:11] washed away. Oh yes, it's true. Yes,
[2:05:15] it's true. There have been days when I
[2:05:20] failed
[2:05:22] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[2:05:26] gone
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:29] astray. But I've learned your love is
[2:05:33] stronger than my weakness.
[2:05:38] And your ear is open every time I
[2:05:44] pray. Oh, and no one else has ever cared
[2:05:49] for me like you,
[2:05:52] Lord. And other friends can never be as
[2:05:57] close to
[2:05:59] me. I'm not afraid to face the problems
[2:06:04] of tomorrow.
[2:06:08] Oh, knowing you are everything I'll ever
[2:06:15] need. I'm
[2:06:19] amazed that you love me. Oh yes, I am.
