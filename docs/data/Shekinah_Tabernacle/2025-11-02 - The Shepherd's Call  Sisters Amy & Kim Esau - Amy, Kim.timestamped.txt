[0:10] I wanded far
[0:15] from the fold [music]
[0:16] where I was safe.
[0:25] And it wasn't long [music]
[0:30] till I found I'd lost my way.
[0:40] And I cried with fear
[0:45] as the night [music]
[0:47] began to fall.
[0:56] One more [singing] lost lamb.
[1:01] Then I heard the shepherds
[1:04] call.
[1:06] [music]
[1:12] He [music] saw [singing] my steps
[1:16] as they walked right [music] into the
[1:20] dark.
[1:27] And though I went astray, [singing]
[1:32] I never [music] once left his heart.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:43] That [music] night long ago, [singing]
[1:47] how I still recall [singing]
[1:57] when I lost [music] my way.
[2:02] I heard the shephers
[2:05] call.
[2:11] And he left the fold
[2:16] to [music] search out that one last.
[2:21] [singing and music]
[2:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:26] He [music] left 99
[2:31] for there was one to be saved.
[2:41] And there on that ledge,
[2:46] one step [music] would have entered
[2:49] it all.
[2:56] But I felt the hesus
[3:01] and I heard the shepherd's
[3:05] call. Oh, [music]
[3:08] [singing]
[3:11] because [music] he saw my steps
[3:16] as they walked right into [singing]
[3:19] [music]
[3:19] the dark.
[3:27] And though I [singing] went astray,
[3:31] I never [singing] once left his heart.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:42] &gt;&gt; And that [music and singing] night long
[3:43] ago,
[3:46] how I [singing and music]
[3:48] still recall
[3:53] [singing]
[3:57] when I lost [singing] my way.
[4:01] I heard the [music] sheepers
[4:05] call.
[4:08] [music]
[4:10] And that night long ago, [singing]
[4:16] how I [music] still recall [singing]
[4:27] when I [singing] lost my way.
[4:32] I heard the shepherds
[4:35] [music]
[4:36] call.
[4:43] [applause]
[4:44] [music]
[4:48] &gt;&gt; [applause]
