quick announcement as you just grab your Bibles so we're having having church lunch the Sunday at the community hub here in Stokes Valley and also there's a music practice as well I mean so if you like to stand with me sorry for making you sit just now let's go to Daniel chapter 9 and we're going to read verses 1 1 2 3 she's here then unit 9 in verse 1 2 3 it says in the first year of Darius a son of a hazardous of the seed of the Medes which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans and the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by the books the number of the years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sack cloth and ashes amen and we'll just go to Zechariah chapter 4 I'm going to read the first seven verses this is in the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what's it thou and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left thereof aside thereof so I answered and spake unto the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord in the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power nor by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts I mean sorry this is the word Lord and as rouble saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou a great mountain before before xue rule thus shall become a plain thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone where with shoutings crying grace grace unto it I mean let's bow our heads in word of Prayer gracious father we thank you we can be gathered this night Lord as our people to be gathered father to you and naught I just ask as we as we gather here Lord we have opened your word and we know that any mortal that can read can open the pages of your Bible and they can they can read the words but it takes you the author to come and anoint it to us Lord to to bring the interpretation and to make it plain we thank you Father this book is not a book of mystery to us anymore but you have revealed it farther in this end time and I just pray father's we look into this this thoughtless night father may you awaken us more and more ahead father may you bless your word to every soul I just father we have we all have needs on our hearts and and battles and things we are going through I pray you to meet those needs Lord this night father according to your riches and glory and we want to pray for those who couldn't make it here this night be their portion and their strength father Lord we just commit the service into your hands may have preeminence for your glory alone we ask these things in your wonderful name and them Lord Jesus Christ amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this night so I want to maybe start a start a subject that if I could title this something I want to speak about awakening to the day an hour in which you live we we are living in a we understand the world as you know we're living in a very important time in history and we but we're going to know where we are in the scripture because if you don't know where you are in the scripture how do you know where you have been and how do you know where you have to go to since you've got to know where you are like if you have a map you know you ought to know where you are on the map to see how much further you have to travel to your destination now Daniel we see here he was reading the prophecy of Jeremiah and he had come to recognize that it was nearly the time of completion of the 70 years where God spake through Jeremiah that they would be carried into Babylon they would be near 70 years then after that 70 years they would return to to the homeland so they came a time when they were going to return to their homeland and this stood up Jeremiah well I mean so I uh it stood Daniel up he began to pray and he began to inquire Lord what is going on in my season what is going on in the day and I on which I live he didn't just let it pass them by he wanted to know amen because he knew that he would have he is going to play a part in the scripture and this prophecy there's word for us that we must fulfill in this day are you following me so far amen to this so we can't just let you know we live in this in this lukewarm age this lady I see in church age you know it's all lukewarm a little bit hot a little bit you are not too hot not too cold just tip it kind of atmosphere and you know we don't want to let that affect our spiritual life I mean this should be a crying out Lord is a scripture for me to fulfill there's a word that must be manifested in my life I don't want to let it pass me by this is my one life I have to live I want to live it for you flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me I mean that your word would be fulfilled in my life hallelujah because the bride has a portion of the word that she must manifest upon the earth and you Moses say it must all be me I mean it's not just enough for my mom or dad or my neighbor I want it to be me Lord I want you to manifest your word in my life so Daniel begin to pray it was more than just tickling his ears I wasn't that interesting 70 years is nearly up he began to pray and he was fasting and he was diligent and he sought God God when's this going to happen you know what's going on in my day an hour and then eventually an angel came and and showed him things that must come to pass now if this was a man living in living in Babylon we didn't even know if he offered a sacrifice there in a strange land I mean but he's just under the Old Testament law and he began to pray and seek God for when when when the next part of the scripture would be fulfilled amen how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ that are not out of their homeland in a strange land but they've come back to the homeland which is their you know which is the Word of God hallelujah how much more people I mean which have a greater promise more than just going from a natural you know from from modern-day Iraq back to Israel but they're going from this world to the next world how much more people are going to be taken hallelujah I think we should pray and seek God and seek Him in his word hallelujah because he's a reward of them that diligently seek Him I mean so I believe we should we should look into the scripture look into what the prophetess taught us about this day and diligently look into it dig into it hallelujah brother Bram says is untapped resources and God is that this resources sitting there in his word that have been untapped and we must will become prospectors and begin to dig and begin to refine and pick it up and see oh this is precious hallelujah was worth the labor I mean you see people they know gold is under some rock and they'll dig and I'll move tons of dirt and tons of rock and they'll put a lot of energy into it and then finally they'll get the gold hallelujah and they know what to worried about all the rock they have to move they say look at all this gold of God amen it should be the same thing with us hallelujah wish me looking at the prize cuz it's worth it all hallelujah now Zechariah he was awakened as one out of sleep now before God really comes your way we're all been sleeping someone who's asleep is they may be in the same room you were but if they're totally asleep they won't catch what's going on they won't understand what's going on because they're asleep but yet they're alive yet they're in the same place you may be in you know there's been a lot of people I mean but the first big earthquake caused them was in Gisborne I slept through it and there were chimneys came down damage to buildings I just slept right through the thing I wasn't awakened to what was going on and the timer was alive we don't want to be asleep when God is shaking this earth we don't want to be asleep when God is calling a bride we don't want to be asleep when he's fulfilling his word and mercy has come upon the earth hallelujah we don't want to be asleep when he's given the invitation I'm going to take you up into a wedding supper I'm gonna unite myself with you here hallelujah we don't want to be asleep so he was Zechariah I was awakened and he began to see some things and it's the same thing with us I'm just kind of laying a bit of a foundation we'll see where this goes later on but you know we've become awakened this message has been sent to awaken us I mean more than just being Church people or religious people but it awakens us I mean that we know that that not just the day now which we live but we know the promise that God has said there's multitudes upon the earth they know world war three is coming they know our mageddon is coming people prep and they do all kinds of things I mean they can see things coming upon the earth but they've missed the awakening of the bride I mean they've missed their ticket out of here but if God be gracious to them I pray he is he'll awaken them to God has to come and awaken you hallelujah and if you've been awakened if he's pulled on your heart and and your and your eyes have come open whose eyes have come open in this day and hour I mean that's got awakened you out of sleep I mean you may have been raised in church set their service after service but there comes a time when God speaks to you and God opens your eyes just to recognize your lust that's God awakening you hallelujah to your present state but he doesn't want to leave you in that state hallelujah he wants to awaken us and if you've been awakened to the promise of this hour you're the most blessed person I mean you're the most blessed person although all the earth Alleluia an angel awakened Zechariah and an angel has awakened us we are living in a precious time you gotta you know God placed great value upon you he's placed great value upon you he put you above his own life he put you above his own blood hallelujah he sent you Elijah the prophet and you just read you read the prophets life of all the strain and the hardship and everything he had to go through I mean that he had come to a place where a sword would be put in his hand the Word of God I meant that that sword had gone to you hallelujah that you had become prepared to meet your God he went through a great deal of hardship and strain and God kept them on earth you know God really trained him and dealt with him maybe more severely than he would deal with us because he was a word gonna come through his lips hallelujah that's how much God God watched over his word for you hallelujah God watched over his word for you God's eyes are upon his children has elected one amen and and that's a good thing because he's interested in you he may he's not really interested in what's going on in North Korea and Russia and whatever more but he's more interested in you he's more interested in his elected ones and he wants you to be awakened because was an awakening comes a comes an awakening to who you are an awakening to your position the Prophet tells us when the bride recognizes what she is then the rapture will go hallelujah there's got to become a recognition more than just up in here in a mental understanding where something drops down into here and you begin to recognize I'm a son or daughter of the king hallelujah his royal blood now flows through my veins hallelujah and that's how we are well you say well how do I know that that I'm one of them how do you know the very reason he told you you were lost it undone is because he wants to take you from that state awaken you because you are one of his children amen now let's go to Isaiah 29 I'm just gonna read we're gonna read a few scriptures but the the promise of this day I'm glad that the mystery of God has become open to us in this hour we're not stumbling around saying as he three is he five of az2 or you know how many is he and you know how what does he love what is he not love how does he want us to be we don't know it's not sealed it's not being sealed up amen if God has awakened you as it would be his wood becomes plain it's not a mystery as and you don't understand it it becomes something that was hidden is now revealed amen so Isaiah 29 and 9 he says here stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with why and they stagger but not with strong drink for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep now this is not speaking of you this is the world this world is being lulled to a drunken sleep and have closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers Hathi covered and the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed amen it's become sealed to some it's become sealed which men deliver one that has learned saying read this I pray thee and he saith I cannot further sealed and the book has delivered to him that does not learn saying read this I pray thee and he saith I am not learned therefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouths and with their lips to honor me but has removed their heart far from me and their fear towards me as taught by the precept of men I'm just going to leave it right there but there so there comes a season where here's the book and people are passing it around what does it say what does it say and you bring it into modern terms people go on YouTube what does this say and they look at this person then they go to go to what this person says about the Bible and they and they search and search them they're saying what does it say what does it say but people who are just probing at things it's sealed to them but unto his elected ones I trust you can say I'm one of them it's not a sealed book Amen it's become an open book hallelujah where things where people do not understand who they are in Christ he makes you understand who you are in him and when he causes you to understand what he's done for you and what redemption really is what salvation really is hallelujah amen he shows you what healing really is and peace hallelujah does he not he does it's not just a nice idea it becomes a reality and when it becomes a reality that means it's not sealed up anymore Amen hallelujah so now there are people in this category but I trust you say well that's pretty tough I just say glory to God I'm thankful not fulfilling that Scripture I mean because it says in the last days that the word I mean the book would be sealed until the time of the end we're living at the time and the end and it's not sealed anymore this Bible is not a book of mystery to us it's a love-letter hallelujah and it's by relationship you can read the love letter and you can understand what he's really saying because you have a relationship just like the Prophet says his wife would write Amelita when he's out on the campaigns and he'd say yeah I just put Billy to bed and that in all different things and he says because I have a relationship with her I understand exactly what she's saying without her even really saying it right out hallelujah because there's a relationship amen and it's the same thing with us amen if you have a relationship with him you understand what he's saying without him really saying it right out we say what do you mean you go into Joseph's life and he see Joseph taking a Gentile bride a man and she's up in the palace before he reveals himself to his brethren he's telling you in there he's saying I'm going to take you marry you take up the wedding supper then I'm going to come down and reveal myself to my brethren hallelujah like the story of Ruth I mean she's a Gentile Boaz the mighty man of it becomes more than a story hallelujah hallelujah now brother Bram says in 1964 in a sermon well a message saying recognizing your day and its message he says everywhere they says what time is it brother what time is it minister do you see that they time of day and the sign you're living under can you understand it do you see it everywhere now there's no revival everybody is complaining ministers crying I was reading an outstanding paper that comes into the church a very fine paper I know the editor I know the people they had godly people very fine brother and sister more of the herald of us coming one of the finest papers on the field here all delivers coming but they hardly will print anything a list it's all about fast pray fast pray see under trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time for spra fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day is a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet then he asked the question why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing there will be awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it a way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you hallelujah and they were you know brother and sister more that was Jack more from life tabernacle and Shreveport brother brand preached a lot of messages there he was one of us campaign managers he is right there by the prophet of God I mean but yet they're saying there's going to be a new breaking of the day pray pray pray he's saying they good people they feel the pull of the hour just like a lot of Christians in the world they feel the pull of the hour we're going to prepare for Armageddon we're going to prep for this and this and this and this there's a pool because a Great Tribulation is going to sit in a min very soon so they feel the pull but they having to recognize their wakening of the brain hallelujah have not recognized the awakening of the bright but there's some people upon the earth I trust I'm looking at them some of them hallelujah Amen that they God has caused him to recognize Amen that this message is more than a man from Kentucky it's a voice from heaven that's God speaking through us through his vindicated servant this is me gathering you to myself hallelujah we've been awakened amen we have been awakened now God is not slack you say well that was preached in 1964 there was a very long time ago most of us were not even born at that time I'll say this God is not slack concerning his promise because if God came back in 1977 and the rapture had gone or wherever more I mean we would not have been there but God waited because he had so many names on the Lamb's Book of Life and those names had to be manifested I mean I believe that you got to say my name was on that book hallelujah and I had to be manifested upon the earth and I had to receive my my Savior amen I had to become one with him hallelujah and then so God is not slack concerning his promise of a rapture amen but he lets it go or what we think of it going on because there's ones that have to come in amen there's got to be people from every kindred nation tongue Amen it has to be there so God God's great timepieces moving on he knows when it's going to happen I meant sometimes we think is just lagging on and I never thought we'd be here in 2018 but here we are but the promise of a body changes just as real I mean it's just as fresh it's still going to happen i mean noah preached for 120 years and maybe here try and start as sermons all different kinds of ways but it always come back to the same conclusion it's going to rain god told me to build this Ark get in the ark when it's finished and you'll be safe when the waters come that was always this conclusion of the service does it matter how much he tried to change it around to make it a bit different it always ended up that same conclusion and then eventually it happened eventually they got in and eventually the all clothes and eventually the rain fell hallelujah that's going to happen it's going to happen God is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that each of perish but that all should come to repentance but the day the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with great noise the elements shall pass melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat aiming at second Peter 3 God is not slack amen better but he is gathering his children out of every corner of the world hallelujah now look at look at wait you know we understand that our redemption is tied and with Israel's Redemption we can see this in the Book of Ruth was now Naomi and and and Ruth and and how and how they were redeemed our our Redemption is linked with the Jewish people and now if you look at the history of of the return of Israel they had a lot of opposition they had a lot of obstacles amen there were there were countries and regimes that would not let the people go there was the Soviet Union and they had their Iron Curtain and Israel was already a nation but the Soviet Union would not let them go but they came a time when the wall fell down and they had to go they had to return to their homeland nothing upon the earth could stop God's children returning to their homeland hallelujah the Jews have to return to their homeland because Jesus will were in the wedding supper he's gonna come down reveal himself to them I mean there's a hundred forty-four thousand of them that are going to be there and God has ordained they'll be there and nothing can stop them being there hallelujah the the iron curtain had to fall amen doesn't matter what man tries to build up to keep God's children from going to their homeland it has to be it has to let go has to go amen anything that gets in the way of God's program that's going to move hallelujah amen he says in Isaiah 43 but now thus saith the Lord that created the Oh Jacob and that formed thee O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine when now passes through the waters I'll be with thee and through the rivers shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am THE LORD thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Savior I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and see before thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for the young people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the east and will gather them from the West I'll say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that's called by my name for I've created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him so when God makes the commandment they must come I mean nothing can hold them back they must come he following me amen the Soviet Union fell apart I mean all the countries that tried to hold them back they fell apart because God said they cannot remain there they must return to their homeland hallelujah and so now if that is the case in the natural how much more in the spiritual I mean this is a natural and natural people coming back to their position in their promised land and God calls come forth amen we hold them not back south give them up hallelujah is a commandment goes forth they had to return just the natural people back to their homeland now how much more spiritual people member we are the spiritual Israel how much more spiritual people who are wandering in darkness there in the foreign field someplace hallelujah maybe a church or out in the world doesn't matter some foreign place and then God calls hallelujah they must come to me they must come back to their homeland hallelujah which is the word of God coming right back into their rightful position and me hallelujah and if any of the cases say the Soviet Union different countries couldn't hold back the natural seed amen no spiritual power can stop amen God's spiritual bride hallelujah coming into her homeland hallelujah brother Bram had a dream role other than dream or vision where all these people were behind iron bars people who knew him and they're saying deliver us help us they had all cancers on their eyes and different things and they and they couldn't get out and then God said oh how can I you know what can I do I think Jesus and God come John says you you delivered him brother branham amen and then he begins to then he begins to speak and he begins to say house of help he says with my natural strength I couldn't break the bars I couldn't free the people but he says he began say house of he'll give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah and all those people that were tanking up with with cancers and different things you know that's all symbolic a lot of us had cancers on our eyes we couldn't see we couldn't see the promise of God I mean we're all crippled up we couldn't walk with him I mean we were behind bars of religion I mean denomination this world we were shut up in a prison house I mean but a word came house of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah and the bars broke and healing came and we walked out free hallelujah and it's the same thing with us friends amen you may have someone who's behind some prison bars you got to speak to that thing it's a house of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you know that word the Prophet was on Sunset Mountain and he felt a sword come into his hand that two idiots thought of the word and he thought of my men tonight people one of the me says no it's the Kings sword a voice said the Kings sword is the Word of God it got placed in a prophets hand hallelujah now that word is sharper more powerfully to injured sword nothing can stand before that sword and in Revelations 19 when he comes on a white horse that sort comes out of his mouth and he just choices enemies with that word now where is that sword friends that sword just as another prophets hand I mean that saw that word came into his hand and he preached that word hallelujah he goes into his bride the bride of Christ that swords in you amen as more than just in your hand it's in your heart in your mouth hallelujah you've got to speak that word amen if you speak your word you say well what you know how good does that help you I say you say something bad you know what if I told you everyone now look at your neighbor tell them they're horrible I can't stand do you know that'll change an atmosphere Werner's it'll change an atmosphere your words have power you follow me your words have power now if that's just on the negative how much more the positive how much more the positive I mean where there's the people that are anointed and anointed to take the word amen and speak that word hallelujah every mountain has to go brother says what a spirit-filled man I'll say all woman takes that word speaks it across their lips it's not them speaking its deity speaking every mountain has to move nothing can stand before that man I mean that's why we've got to really change how we think about ourselves and how we speak I mean because we can get into a negative pattern in our minds yeah we're too tired we can you know I'll never be able to attain the promise you know I'm just too weary and life is too hard you know you get into a cycle of thinking that way I mean that's a slave mentality and then we're not called to think like that or to speak like that we're sons and daughters of the king I mean where God has made us more than conquerors hallelujah that every no weapon formed against thee shall prosper hallelujah you got to begin to think I'm safe he saved me I've been redeemed I've been healed I've been called out hallelujah I mean I mean there's no chasm between me and God anymore I'm his child that's why he called me hallelujah I'm his bride that's why he Knight himself with me hallelujah you gotta start to think like that you gotta start to think like that I mean because otherwise you just get your mind fixed on situations and things that are going on and and doesn't help you what your what what what good is that kind of thinking I'm in the enjoy your Israel came out of Egypt they were still they still had a slave mentality I mean when they you know when they come in to take the land they say we can't take this land because they were thinking about what they were back in Egypt but there was a Caleb and Joshua they were not thinking about what they were they'll think about what God had made them hallelujah and you're going to be the same way I mean we're not slaves to sin anymore friends we're not we're not slaves to the devil I mean but we've been liberated and then we've been set free I'm in the house of hell is given way hallelujah went out there behind prison bars anymore hallelujah you go to start thinking you're the greatest battles in here and the devil tells you you'll never have victory you'll never overcome you'll never have peace you don't really have salvation you gotta you gotta say hold on hold on that's what you think about me but what does God say about me what does he say I am that's the only one his and it's not an opinion but I'm just gonna use the word cuz I can't think of a better one his opinion about me is the only thing that matters what he has said what is he said about me Amen he says you're a spotless virgin bride child of the free woman not child of the bonds woman hallelujah were not child of the bonds on with child of the free hallelujah that means we're not under slavery of anyone we're free people hallelujah you're free precedent Christ hallelujah Amen we had to start speaking to our we were to start dealing with our enemy we should we don't have to put up with his devices and what he's trying to put on us I mean but you got to stand like their prophet the same God that made the prophet meets us he's Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah he does the same things Amen of a propaganda even though you said was just a vision or a dream no people were delivered the house of hell gave way hallelujah people walked out free and healed and restored hallelujah how many of us were and in prison houses I'm in with cancer's on our eyes we couldn't walk hallelujah we couldn't walk with him and then a voice came I mean what has he done for you friends hallelujah and the house of Hell had to give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen it must give way we are friends Joshua was under the blood of bulls and goats he he didn't have a scripture for Anna Sun and a moon to stand still but he was walking in God's he was walking by with the leadership of the Holy Ghost and he was fighting his enemy and he needed more time to totally defeat them and he just commanded understand still I don't know how they stood still but they stood still do you believe the scripture I mean he did to say to our scripture for the inspiration came and he spoke it forth hallelujah as the same thing with you and I we need to look at what we were I mean you look at what God has made you when the bride knows what she is holy and in the rapture all go amen if he is his he said there's no spot against you amen the evidence has been annihilated in the blood of Jesus Christ you never do it in the first place you know the Bible is full of people speaking you know you say well that's pretty obvious because it's record written word I mean spoken word written down but you read the subs David says I'll praise thee I'll give you praise I thank you our Lord you know he's expressing he's expressing how he feels towards God and what God means to him he doesn't always you know there's a lot of speaking going on we have to speak the same kind of way it says in Revelations 12 they overcame him by the blood of lamb in the word of their testimony and that testimony is God's Word is truth it applies to me Amen it is for me amen his salvation for me his redemption is for me Amen in devil I'm going to overcome you by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony hallelujah my testimony is God has joined himself to me by his blood amen he as he is determined well God has determined I'm just going to preach a little bit friends of you don't mind I'm God is determined to see you in a rapture a man goddess determined to have a bride with that spot or wrinkle and this is more than positive speaking and even cans with judge Racine let's go take the land there wasn't just positive thinking I promise anchored into their heart they took God in His Word and they said let's go take it hallelujah sure this Giants show there's obstacles but they'll fall God allows Giants in your life because he wants to prove himself I mean he wants to prove his salvation you say well the enemy's really chasing me down hallelujah I mean God you got me out of that scrape you'll get me out of this one hallelujah you have confidence in his salvation amen we have to have a positive confession you ever think a negative thought don't ever pay attention to a negative thought I mean that is not you that is the devil trying to get you bombed down amen and say you're worthless look at this world look what the modern world has made people amen it's dehumanized everyone look at the fashion world as dehumanized everyone the sports world entertainment I mean there's no real humanity on display people are just tools and objects and that's what the devil wants to make of humanity I say he can come this far but no more as for me and my house will not be come at all amen or just some object hallelujah my god thinks far more of me than just a tool or an object hallelujah never think negative saying you're worthless you're not worthless you may be the dumbest person in the class and the dumbest class of the dumbest school amen but that doesn't matter you're highly valued in God's eyes hallelujah you're very highly valued amen and the book of Easter we weren't we weren't read it but an Easter after after Haman has been hung and the King signs a new law that that the Jews can avenge their enemies you know they didn't just wipe out their enemies attack them once they did it like twice have you read that should we go read it if I see I'm not gonna read it please just read this again we should be on the warpath amen if I went real quiet I thought we're a peaceful people yeah love peaceably with all men but not with the devil amen we're not here to live peaceably with with him now if we read in chapter 9 sees here now season verse 5 thus the Jews smite all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would to those that hated him right and then let's go down to verse 13 I'm just I'm just skipping you can read the whole chapter the insidious if it please the King let it be granted to the juice which is in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree do you have it up there so so so they've already they've already took vengeance on their enemy and then it's to go to the king again I want to do it again I want to do it again and they do it again hallelujah don't see it all just for one victory I want to I want to give the devil a black eye every day and you know the best way to give him a black eye live a consecrated life to God love the Lord with all your heart soul and mind and strength that gives the devil black eye I mimicked because someone can be so surrender to God that the devil doesn't know what to do with them hallelujah that really you don't just go you know don't just go chasing Devils love the Lord with all that you are being loving worship in every moment of your life the devil can't stand that the devil cannot stand a people that that want nothing to do with his works Alleluia so now we've been awakened we've been awakened no this is just maybe a opening thing but friends were being awakened and we've been awakened to come to a position in Christ this is more than just an awakening you say well I know where we are it's more than that God wants to recognize who you are and what you are amen and many times we are in a position before we even realize it you read the book of Ephesians where where Paul starts with you know he starts with who Jesus is and then and then begins to go and how they believed and they heard the gospel they trusted and they're sealed into the kingdom he goes into chapter 2 he says you were once dead in trespasses and sins and now you've been quickened you were made alive this has already happened to them but he's now he's placing their experience this is we were Alleluia and then he goes from there and he goes through through verse B chapter 3 to chapter 4 now let's grow into the fullness of the statue of Christ and then finally ends up put on the whole armor of God I mean but he's trying to give them to see this is who you are this is what God has done for you but now let's press on to the mark of the high calling in Christ and it's got to be the same yeah the Prophet tells us we've come to another Ephesians again he says that I believe it some paradox we've come to Ephesians again but instead of aiming at and relaxing we possess the promise Alleluia and so but it's by knowing who we are and him that's how we we have to recognize what God has made us they meant we have to recognize what God has made us because that gives us power of the devil I mean brother Bram and I'll say this in closing he gives a story of a of a slave buyer that goes to a plantation and he's and he's wanting to buy slaves he looks around at all the slaves as there's an America and he sees one slave and he walks different he works different he acts different to the rest of the slaves and the slave owner says to the plantation owner I want to buy that one and the plantation owner says no he's not for sale in the slave bias is now what front about him he says well I was wondering that too and the and the and the slave by said do you feed him different no don't feed him different do you treat him different as he do different work than the others or does he sleep in a different place he sleeps in the same place well what makes him different well I begin to ask around I found out that back in Africa his dad is a king of a tribe and though he'd be far away from home and he will never go back to Africa to to to take his father's place he knows he's a king son and so he treats himself as a king son he conducts himself as a king son and that's why he's different because he knew who he was doesn't matter that he was in a in a plantation far away from his homeland he knew his royal blood in my veins I'm a king and so we operate he lived according to who he was it's got to be the same thing with us we live in the same world that everyone else lives in there's no temptation common to man that tempts you everything that comes against us comes against them Amen we live in the same economy we have all the same things that going on just like that that slave was on the same plantation as the other slaves but in you who he was and it's got to be the same thing that's what God wants you to know amen you're not just another person off the street you're one of mine you're an elected one amen you're one of my blood washed ones before the foundation of the world I mean the lamb was slain for you how Lou you I put a deposit of me and you before the foundation of the world I mean that the reason you've become awakened is because that seed has become awakened hallelujah Amen Lee once you recognize that this is not a fly-by-night I'll try this and I'll try that and see how it works that's not what this message is this is God this is God moving over the earth brooding over the earth to find his elected ones hallelujah just like Genesis one the world was out formal void darkness covered the face of the deep in the Spirit of God moved upon the waters he had a purpose of moving I have seed in this earth I wanted to come forth hallelujah and you were covered in darkness you are that form you just like the world and he began to brood over you I'll Lou your child of mine if we're gonna separate light from darkness separate things out of your life holy just like Abraham was separated from things and you begin to find yourself it's a life that comes forth hallelujah you didn't even know was there who knew that they were a child of god when they were little Alton's you know maybe while I was raising you John you but no but who really knew I don't know but something in me brothers is it that that seed is crying for expression and you may not do it's a deep calling to the deep you may not understand what is this thing why am I not happy in the world or all footing in them places it's because there's that seed there and it's calling out and then eventually the Spirit of God comes and broods over your life am I gonna find out this this sounds like home to me this is where I really belong hallelujah amen amen and that's God's election amen he has a purpose he doesn't just it's just like when he died on Calvary he died for the sins of the world but he didn't hang up there saying well I hope some people feel sympathetic and they'll follow me later no he knew who who would serve him he knew who would who would believe him and he knew who he would reveal it to that he really did die for them hallelujah amen when I was on the cross I mean when he was on the cross I was on his mind hello I always get things mixed up amen where's some musicians please I trust you've been awakened this message is more than a books and tapes this Bible is more than just words on on paper it's a living reality hallelujah amen I think we should sing that song I'm a king and priests to God hallelujah to the lamb amen amen let's dad shall we Lou young I meant he loves a lot today I
