name of our Lord Jesus Christ mine it won't be long but I feel it's significant to me and I thought I could share it with you um just to encourage you we went to support over that side to brother Tess so on our way back there was a lot of cars on the road that came or are going to the race you know with these race cars pulling pulling a little a race car at the back those ones so there was a lot of them on the road now we filled up and then left the road before ohaki is very windy very windy and I gave kir to drive while it's still light and I'm going to drive H when it gets dark so it was going very well and then strangely many of us will be sleeping when another one is driving so we were almost all awake so we saw this an almost an accident that that almost happened so as we just went around the band actually before the band I I said to K hey we were talking about you know these yellow boards that that directs you how how the road bends how sharp it is and they give you the estimate speed you see these ones they'll say 75 85 or 80 whatever so I was we were just chatting about that and I say you see these boats you must use them when you see it that's the average speed you can navigate that cave so he was not speeding just to clear to clear the boy so as soon as we we we get onto that band that sharp band man it was just a two lane one way I was I mean two lanes that way that way then a car BMW pulling one of those race cars came directly in our lane and it was coming for us and it he was overtaking a truck and he's he is pulling a trailer with that car so it was so fast that I knew that if the angel of the Lord was not in the car right now you could be singing himym songs while we are jumping in heaven right now because that's what almost happened he almost wanted to destroy my whole family and that car was was not going slow only us were going slow because we've just finished talking about navigating the road and you know that bend at a certain speed and this car just come he was trying to push to pass that truck and come in and he he just couldn't do it by the grace of God the road had a little bit of a a shoulder kirat said he told us that I didn't plan I I didn't know what to do we were all just shocked I didn't even have time to tell him hey just go this way I did not have nobody had time to react we were just shocked and it was so I believe it was the angel of the Lord who moved the car to the left because he gave that Sky a space of a meter or less just to pass us and then he was gone and and we we were only reacting saying what is happening or why is he doing this after so that's how fast it was when he came so I just wanted to tell you to encourage you that you know never forget to pray when you travel that's very very important because because the angel of the Lord is with you if you forget ask the Lord beforehand to remind you he will remind you so never never never forget to pray when you are on the road even if you already left and the Lord reminds you do it while you're driving be reverent and ask the Lord to be with you in the car because the enemy is on a rampage or people of God are he wants to take opportunities God bless you me God bless you brother PA we can have the coin goes up please [Music] I'm going to stand having done all I can I'm going to hand the fight to you I ain't afraid of facing

praise the Lord thanks brother Josh thank you musicians amen God bless you all great to have everyone here tonight this communion for washing service is the first one we've had here so I think we'll just try and IR out all the Kinks and see how it all goes but I believe we're in for a blessed time tonight amen praise the Lord so let's um let's go to the scripture we're going to go to um I have here numbers U Joshua 14 and: 11 just want to read one or rather from verse 10 actually let's no let's go up further go to verse 5 this is this is Caleb speaking to Joshua okay from so from verse 5 now and and Joshua 14 sorry I don't have a slideshow so we're just going to do the oldfashioned thing today amen so Joshua 14:5 says as the Lord commanded Moses so the children of Israel did and they divided the land then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of Jeff the kenite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh Baria 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Baria to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people mouth but I holy followed the Lord my God and Moses swear uh on that day saying surely the land wherein thou feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast fully followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses uh while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now low I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain of the Lord spake uh in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakins were there and that the cities were great and fenced and if so be the Lord will be with me then I will be able to draw drive them out as the Lord commanded and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jeffan Hebron for an inheritance praise the Lord amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen hallelujah PR oh precious Lord Jesus truly How Great Thou Art my God we love you Lord we thank you for this great privilege dear God to to assemble together Lord to take the communion to wash one another's feet I pray this would be a very special evening for us all in your great presence Lord we Love You Lord we asking that you would push back every every Spirit everything that's not of you father may your blood Lord cover us dear God may you have prance in our lives Lord we love you so much thank you for all you're doing and have done and will do we praise Your Great Name this day Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh tonight so I want to speak about uh Caleb here and I want to take from uh from from verse uh 11 how he says as my strength was then even so my strength is now now we understand that Josh uh Caleb when he uh Caleb was there in uh in uh Egypt we know and uh we understand that the strength that he came out uh with and was able to be as strong as he was at 85 years old as he was at 40 was because he took the Passover in Egypt I believe the supernatural strength that we receive from when we become one with our Lord Jesus Christ and that you know we can look back at our lives and we can say truly the Lord's it's by the Lord's strength and his mercy and his grace and his ability we are still alive and well that we're still serving the lord it's not been by Our Own Strength our own Works how smart we are how how we have worked things out it's by him that we are standing it's by him that we're strong Amen Let the weak say they are strong amen let the poor say they are rich amen hallelujah the blind say they can see amen cuz our God is more than sufficient he's more than able and we can say we're strong now as we were when we first believed amen that God has kept us he has led us he has equipped us he's protected us amen it's been him from the beginning to the end amen and it will be into eternity amen so we can stand like Caleb stood he says I'm imagine 85y old man saying I have not diminished in strength one bit compared to when I was 40 years old amen he's he was just as strong and the reason he was just as strong is because he had a he had a Worthy that he had to fulfill which was taking that inheritance amen taking that mountain amen that was the word of God that he had to fulfill in his life and God gave him strength that he would fulfill that word now friends we have a word to fulfill too amen that they were Char sleep amen noten you the dead in Christ are raised and they which are alive and remain will be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air amen that is our scripture we are called to fulfill amen so God Will Keep Us strong he'll keep us able amen he'll keep us loving him and until that scripture is fulfilled and after that scripture is fulfilled we'll be dancing on streets of gold amen and when we hug each other Embrace each other when we're all look 18 to 21 whatever whatever our Peak looks are whatever that is amen we'll say it was the Lord that brought us here amen it wasn't our strength it wasn't how smart we were as you know it wasn't how we put it all together it was all him hallelujah amen you think about Joshua you know he you know when when he took the Passover the the first you could say communion you know as a shadow back there in the Old Testament you know he didn't know what what what was awaiting him all he knew there was a land promised amen that's all he had amen and you know so they in faith they applied the blood and they and they and they became one with that lamb and they ate the unle bread and they walked out of Egypt now if we go to uh Deuteronomy um Deuteronomy I think it's 29 here and we want to go down to verse 5 uh a few years between what we just read or before uh Moses would give this declaration to realize it's God's strength it's God's strength it's not your strength it's not my strength it's God's strength amen we are walking by the strength of the Lord hallelujah I like that don't you amen I like it when we just look back and say Lord it was you it is you amen so in Deuteronomy 29 we'll read from verse five he says here and I have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxing old upon you and thy Sho Is Not wax n upon thy feet amen so he's saying here that the clothes you walked out on in are still good they went through Desert Sands they went through Rocky places imagine imagine trying to wear the same pair of clothes for 40 years the same shoes you would be walking in maybe some shoelaces if you had half of one left it would have all been worn out as in the walk but because they left Egypt under the blood of the Lamb amen God God gave them strength God equipped them aen men that that that what they were walking in when they left out did not wear out friends I say Amen this gospel keeps amen it doesn't wear out this salvation doesn't get old it doesn't perish it doesn't get threadbear amen but it stays as strong and vibrant and full of life as it was when you first become one with him hallelujah amen but you look at Joshua now you what a blessed man he's taking the Passover he has no idea what's going to what's going to face him but he but but he can look back and say God has come down with a mighty hand amen when I could not deliver myself I could not help my own family God came down answered my prayer brought Deliverance into my house and God sent a prophet amen sent a word amen smoke the Egyptians and now we're walking out in the morning Hallelujah and one of these mornings friends we're going to be leaving this world Amen why because God has sent a Vindicator word to prove Calvary Works amen it's going to take you from this world to the next World Hallelujah I me there's Caleb now he's leaving he could he he could you know think back about what happened there with the plagues but then he into the Red Sea Watch God Amen open a way where there seemed to be no way and drown his enemy behind him when he walked through amen he could remember now when um you know he was there at Mount Si God came down his word God God revealed his word to him and something anchored that word anchored in his heart it didn't to the others but it did him and that's the main thing what has it done for you amen what has it done for you this message has transformed us we didn't work it out we didn't have to say well make it all fit it just fit somehow I mean we're like the woman at the well amen come see a man who's told me all the things they've ever done is this not the very Messiah amen this is what this message is is Messiah revealed amen so he could rejoice in those things and you know what I love about uh Caleb God allowed him to go into the promised land to search out where he was going to live someday amen and then come back with the evidence that that land is good and friends we amen we God allows us by his grace Amen to to Taste Of Heaven to taste where we're going to live some day when the Holy Ghost sweeps down and fills your life and lives out of you and you see the word being manifested and maybe you're living under a cloud but just the wind of the Holy Ghost begins to blow and you begin to sing a song or something and what heaven comes down am mean what is that that's a taste of where you're going to live it's just a little shadow of it but it's just but it's still amen it's still glory amen comes down and sweeps over your soul so he came back after spying out the land saying the land is good amen and and then and then he could say listen I was looking around there's a lot of nice places but when I saw that mountain something in me said that's yours amen and we can say the same thing with the word am mean you read the scripture you hear the message and there's and there's Parts there's promises where just anchors in your heart that's yours amen I trust the Rapture is a revelation to you tonight amen that's anchored in your heart that's yours amen and what God gives you have amen amen he doesn't give it and take it away he's not an Indian giver he gives it then he makes sure you receive it amen just like Caleb when God revealed to Caleb that's your Mountain God made sure he was going to get it CU he gave him strength to do it Hallelujah yes sir he lived such a life not by his own ability but by the strength of the Lamb he could remember one day when they were fighting the amalekites I think it was and Moses was on the mountain and his hands were raised and he saw Victory be manifested cuz the man's ra hands were raised up on a mountain and we can look back and say the victory that's we've seen in our lives because the king of kings and Lord of lords hands are raised on Calvary on a mountain amen a victory was won a great victory over hell death in the grave and we can look back and say Lord you won it there because you w it there I'm going to live out that Victory because of what you've done hallelujah the Lord praise God Caleb went through a lot of dark times a lot of difficult times but that didn't change who he was in the Lord right God allowed those things to happen but something anchored in Caleb I ain't staying here kades barer was not his end destination cor and Dayan splitting the church wasn't his end destination amen the unbelief of the Elders of his of his peir group caused him to walk in the you know desert for 40 years that was not his end destination God told him you've got to remind God sometimes you've got to take the scripture God is quick into your heart and you've got to remind God just like God youo Caleb reminded um Joshua remember what Moses told me remember what you were there Joshua when when Moses told me I'm going to take the land now I'm here the Mountain's here I'm here I want what God has given me Hallelujah God loves it when we quote his word back to him hallelujah amen so friends I just I I just want to keep it close like that but I'm sure we can look back say Lord 2024 the reason I'm still here is because of your strength because of the strength of the Lamb it wasn't how smart I was how whatever I did it was you Lord hallelujah and we can and now we can look at the start of 2025 or well actually we're nearly a month down but you know a lot of children some have already gone back to school some are going to school I pray when you step into those school grounds you say Lord this may be a new class maybe a new year maybe different school but Lord I'm coming in here by your strength amen I don't know what I'm going to face I don't know what spirit's going to try and grab me I don't know what's going to happen but I don't fear those things because I'm walking by Your Divine strength I'm not trusting in my ability how smart I think I am or things I can work out I'm trusting in your strength in my life and parents we can all do the same thing amen young old whatever age we are we can say Lord because you live because it's your strength I'm going to walk into this year trusting you like never before gu what's beautiful the more you walk with the Lord the more you can look back and say God you've kept me God you've preserved me God you've taken me out a lot of tight spots God in spite of me you you I wanted to W off the path but you brought me back lord father you've done so much more to me and I'm so thankful for it Lord that's so we can just have such such confidence friends it doesn't matter what you're whatever you're going through Caleb went through a lot of things but it was the strength of the Lamb hallelujah hallelujah and what are we going to walk through this year Overcoming By the strength of our lamb and we we know that our our lamb wasn't just a natural lamb it was the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I mean so if he could walk out of Egypt there by the natural blood of a lamb and eating a natural lamb and yet and he could overcome like he did how much more you and I friends under the blood of Jesus Christ becoming one with our sacrifice amen Our God's good we're going to make it Hallelujah you let's um wait let's just read one more scripture let's go to Jeremiah I I'm sure most of us could quote it but let's just go to Jeremiah 29:11 I'm sure we could all you know but I read this I saw it somewhere but it's just um Jeremiah we're going to read this then we're going to go to um sorry now I read this I saw it and it was the NIV and I can't remember the most of what it said but I just remember the last part of the verse and in the so I'll just just read this in the King James for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end the NIV it says instead of an expected end it just says to give you a future and a hope but we don't live by hope we live by Revelation and what to me an expected end is far deeper than a than a than a future and a hope cuz our expected end is what Rapture isn't that our expected end we came from God we go back to God and how are we're going to do it by the strength of the Lord by the strength of our lamb amen so as we as we come to the communion table tonight I pray would just say thank you Lord you know I know it's always a special time when we gather around and we you know we take of the Lord's table than we have uh foot washing I pray we can look back at the previous years and or just the previous year and you know sure we've had failures we've had disappointments we've had hardship and all those things but I trust we can look back at those things and say Lord brought me through by your strength and Lord as I go into this new year new school new school year whatever it is lord it's going to be by your strength that I'm going to walk through those things amen so let's just um let's just uh well well let's go to 1 Corinthians 11 and chapter 23 and we're going to read here um down to down to verse 34 so 1 Corinthians 11:23 down to ver verse 34 amen he says for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that night the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come where uh wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen so can we have um um brother cin brother Ed can you can can you come up and we're just going to do you want to um can you bring the bring the wine where is going to bless the we know this is not the literal blood and body of our Lord Jesus but it's just symbolic no matter what I see no matter what I feel no matter what I hear I believe no matter what I'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it cost I believe and if I look it seems like it's broken I'll lay a Hallelujah on the AR and if I look it seems it's over I'll lay a Hallelujah on the altar because he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle work God he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle
