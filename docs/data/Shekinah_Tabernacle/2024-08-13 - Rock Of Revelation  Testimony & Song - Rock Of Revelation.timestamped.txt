[0:00] I want to share something just before we
[0:02] do this song because we're we're going
[0:04] to teach you this. We'll play the song
[0:06] as an item and then we'll sing it all
[0:09] together after that as like a
[0:10] congregational song and then we'll call
[0:11] up brother Ben after that. Um,
[0:16] this may be uh a little bit different,
[0:20] but um the song came in an unusual sort
[0:24] of way in that it came reasonably easy
[0:28] for me to sort of pin it together. Could
[0:30] I have brother um Cuban, can you go and
[0:32] stand next to uh Vanessa for a second
[0:35] and stand up as well, Vanessa? So, put
[0:39] you on this is I'm just going to put you
[0:40] on the spot for a bit.
[0:44] Usually
[0:46] songs,
[0:47] most of the time I
[0:50] not all the time, but most of the time
[0:51] you go through something and then you
[0:52] pen an experience that you've been
[0:54] through. That's how that's how I've
[0:56] always done songwriting anyway. You sort
[0:58] of pen something that you've you go
[1:00] through some trial or some up or down
[1:01] and you sort of capture it in a in a
[1:03] tune and bring it out. But the other
[1:06] week, I think Ben was preaching
[1:08] something and I was just sitting on the
[1:09] chair over here and and this bit of
[1:11] inspiration came and it was like,
[1:14] I don't want to pen something for
[1:15] myself, but I want to pen something for
[1:17] somebody else. I just want to
[1:20] have get something for somebody else
[1:23] somehow. I don't know. I just wanted to
[1:24] capture something in some way. And I was
[1:28] sitting like this, I guess, like that.
[1:30] And I looked over this way and that's
[1:31] where the the moods sit over there. And
[1:35] it kind of something just went and a
[1:37] little spark went off and and and
[1:41] then I then the song sort of came
[1:44] reasonably
[1:46] easier than what most songs do. It sort
[1:47] of just every time I picked up the
[1:49] guitar would just a more would come and
[1:50] then I'd sit in church another bit would
[1:51] come and it would it was it wasn't there
[1:53] wasn't any effort. So I feel like it was
[1:56] I'm not going to say it is but it I kind
[1:59] of feel maybe if something was inspired
[2:01] I don't know what inspiration is but
[2:02] that maybe that was it. The reason why
[2:04] I've got them to stand up was because I
[2:05] I don't I I feel like it was maybe given
[2:08] to them
[2:09] to then maybe share with us
[2:12] if I could put it that way. So
[2:16] is it was a wee bit too supernatural for
[2:17] my general undertaking of how I do
[2:20] things. You know, I usually fumble
[2:22] around. So So
[2:25] I kind of Yeah, maybe I'm going on a
[2:27] limb, but I just feel like there was
[2:28] something supernatural happened. And
[2:29] this is this is your song. It was It was
[2:31] I feel like it was sort of given to you.
[2:34] Now, we all will partake of it because
[2:36] we like music's like that once you put
[2:39] it in the public domain, we all we all
[2:40] we we all take our little bit of it, you
[2:42] know, but there's an inspiration behind
[2:43] something and I feel like it was sort of
[2:46] I just managed to capture it and oh,
[2:47] here it is here and and pass it over.
[2:49] That's kind of was what I So, this will
[2:51] always be So, take this I think is from
[2:54] the Lord for you and and and take the
[2:57] words yourself
[2:59] there for you to speak out. Okay. So, so
[3:01] this is this is what I wanted to say
[3:04] before we do the song. Okay. So, yeah.
