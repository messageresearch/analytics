other band let's just um let's stand this morning to worship Lord you can just start playing the song this is just a um just a new song we're going to sing this morning some of you may not um you can just start playing the intro and um I just I just love to Worship the Lord sometimes you know sometimes we get into situations I remember one time I was when I was running a little church in Gisborne felt like the Lord said to do it and the Lord opened up things and then some older brothers this may not mean something to some people but some older older brothers that were older than me they were these guys hadn't gone to church for about 20 years but they sort of seemed to think they knew everything about how churches should work in that but they just sort of stayed home didn't go anywhere but they they kind of came along for a bit and then they sort of teamed up together to kind of gang up on me in a way I suppose and they started saying you know the Lord's given me all these things in the 3:00 in the morning and telling me to tell you you're wrong and all these things you need to stop and all this sort of stuff you know when you're quite young it's quite hard to take you know it's intense on you they they're basically preaching hell far over and you're saying if you don't repent stop this you're going to be going it's all over for you and this is your last chance and everything and you know I didn't really feel right about it because I'm like looking at them thinking these guys don't go anywhere they don't do anything and they can walk out of the come out of the you know closet and you know it it doesn't quite work like that but it was very hard to take I almost went a couple of times my life were almost gone insane and that was one of them I just was too much sometimes to it just almost went pop you know between this world and some but you know in those times you just find you can just Worship the Lord I just think Lord when it all gets too much Lord I just worship I just want to worship Lord and and you know what I did I actually went out for a trap fish I went out way up in the country there and I went to this new river that I'd never been to before fishing in it anyway I had the most amazing trout fish you ever had man there was trout everywhere I was pulling them up one after the other and I was just rejoicing because the Lord knows I love Trap Fishing I was just pulling these trout up like you wouldn't believe in you know but at the same time I was just worshiping Lord I'm just going to worship I don't know I can't make sense of all this Lord and but I'm just going to worship today Lord I'm just going to worship Lord because you know it starts over here it ends up here and all the stuff in here doesn't matter you know we get to situations where sometimes things don't make logical sense it's just it's just intense it's precious it's all this stuff it's just like you know but we can just sometimes you just it starts here it ends up over there all the stuff in here when it all gets too much just worship Lord I just worship you this morning Lord and that's we're just going to I Just Want To Worship we'll just Worship the

aren't you glad this message shows you you have a place in gloryland amen it's not a I hope I have a place I know how do you know he showed me amen praise the Lord let's go to Ephesians 1 And1 says here and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsil of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom ye also trusted after you had heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession and to the praise of his glory wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance uh in in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us Lord who believe according to the working of his working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right handed in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all amen let's pray this morning amen let's amen let's talk to our great God lord Jesus we're so thankful we can bow our heads in your presence and give you glory and give you praise Lord truly you are Mighty Lord you are great Lord You're our deliverer Lord we're so thankful we can Praise Your Great Name thank you Father as we feel your presence already Among Us Lord I ask that You' touch every life Lord may you take these words Lord anoint them Father anoint speaker and hearer Lord may you be lifted up in our midst and I pray that everything that's not of you father every Spirit Lord every thought that's not of you may it be driven out now in the name of Jesus Christ may your blood cover each and every one of us dear God may you be Lord may you just have your freeway in this service and not only here but those who are streaming and may meet every need Lord we love you and we we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to continue um I want to continue uh from last Sunday Kind of about about the eagle anointing and especially about how he causes us to see where we're going now if you know where you're going it changes everything right I know like you think of a destination school there's not a lot of Joy a lot of people when you know you're going to school if you go to school you can say amen I see some some head shaking like yeah I agree right if you're going on holiday that changes your whole outlook right I'm just I just want you to think about this when you think about where you're going right and the more you uh the more you're excited about where you're going the more you want to know about that place and then also you want to know how you're going to get there now we we know that our eyes have have come you know I said all that because we realize we know where we're going right we're not guessing we're not we're not imagining that there's maybe a heaven and maybe we're going to get there and maybe it's all going to work out fine we know amen because the great builder of that City the great maker of of of of Heaven and Earth has come down personally and told you where you're going now I think I think as the Bride of the you know bride of Jesus Christ I think we should encourage ourselves knowing where we're going right because if we can look at our destination it doesn't matter the journey the journey is for a purpose amen that we end up in that City to to develop our character to mold us and shape us so you know the journey uh some people say the destination is the journey I said no that's not it no the destination is the destination we're just passing through a place now God has allowed us to look past a curtain a time you know many times you know we hear like rejected King brother B relates the story of of of how he was laying in bed he was 50 odd years old he says you know you he said to himself well if he is ever going to do anything for the Lord he better to do it now he's an old man and then he heard a voice saying would you like to look past the curtain and and that and that and that realm that you know that glorious place was just he said it was just above the door frame it's just there in a higher Dimension it's not somewhere a million billion miles away it's it's just here right that that that great unseen place and before he knew it he was in that place and he was young and it was perfect love and he and he could describe what the people looked like and things but he could never describe how Sublime how great that place was now the prophet was taken beyond the curtain of time to come back and tell us that place is real right but then now that place that great because that is you know you know the Holy Ghost fills that place and then and then the then the spirit of God comes down into this Dimension and touches you and changes you and turns you around and gives you a faith in his word because he's telling you you belong in that land hallelujah amen so so our eyes you our eyes of understanding this is really I wanted just to read Verse 18 but you start reading Ephesians it's hard to where do you get on where do you get off you know because it's such a beautiful beautiful book so that's why we read a whole bunch but you know he says that the eyes of your are understanding being enlightened now this un um this this uh being enlightened means they have come open you're no longer in a dream you're no longer just asleep but you're awakened and and we are we are truly living in a day where people have come awake right you know because even even if you look at you know before you meet the Lord you're actually living asleep and you're asleep walking you know we had one of our daughters I won't name who but there's three some sure you get a 33% chance of guessing but they they fell asleep in their bed and then the next morning they woke up in one of their sister's beds and so they were they they got out of bed they started walking they didn't crash into any doors they opened doors they got up they got into the bed maybe told the sister move over all that while asleep so people can do things and we all I'm sure most of us sleepwalked while we were young yeah I think I did you know but you see um sleepwalking you're actually doing things but you're not conscious of what you're doing and then when she woke up the next morning she's thinking how did I get here right but the light came on right it was no longer night season it became a day there was a Breaking of a day the sun came up and then and then I woke them up out of bed a voice came wake up it's time to get up and she woke up how did I get here and it's many times the same things with our Christian Journey we're actually born asleep and we go through life and we're doing things but then but there comes a day when the Sun rises in our life the s o n Rises and he begins to speak to us we hear his voice and and our eyes come home we think man how did I get here hallelujah but you see he doesn't leave you just with that question he begins to show you this is how you got here and this is where you're going amen you love the Lord to uh uh this morning I'm just going to enjoy myself today you know because our God's great and we can have such confidence of our final destination amen now now Zechariah would say this in Zechariah Chapter chapter 4 here and he'd speaking you know the angel that talked with him uh uh talked with me came again and wed me as a man that is awakened out of out of sleep and so here he was he was then he began to see things that he wasn't you know cuz when you're asleep things can happen around you some people can sleep very deep you people can come and turn on lights rearrange things and you know turn off the light walk out and that person can not conscious of anything that's taking place but so but when you're awaken you can realize what you're even you know what's even around you and this is what the Lord has done he he said he said unto me what see it thou I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl the top of it and the Seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so he's beginning to see the seven Church ages beginning to see where he is in time but then there came a then there came a question now where he says he says what are these um and and so I answered and and and I spoke to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord so sometimes we can see things we don't understand what they are but the message of the hours open our eyes so we can see what what the word says we're going to go a bit faster eventually okay I just want to lay these things because if you could realize God has anchored in your soul you have a place at the wedding supper table God has anchored that and he's revealed it and he ain't going to change his mind he never changes his mind he he he ordained your position there before the foundation of the world right and he doesn't change his mind about that nothing you can do it see if you're an elected Gene seed of God nothing you can do upon this Earth can disqualify your place at the table I know that may be very strong but if God has predestinated you there amen then you're going to end there sure you'll end up with different rewards and things the things you do in this life but you will end up there right because you're part of him I mean so if that's the case all fear should leave I mean what do we got to worry about honestly what do we got to fear if our lord Jesus Tri Christ took our full punishment that we should have received he took the wrath of God upon himself that day on Calvary the Judgment we should have received he took upon himself for you and I the sin question settled amen it's all done what do we have to fear why do we hold back why don't we just let God use us like never before I mean cuz if God has ordained that we're going to be there I say let's press the battle let's not pull back and say well what if I fail well brother brah said I'd rather be on the battlefield trying to win souls for Christ than do nothing he says what are you doing about it am mean so sure I think we should preach the battle I think we should be bold in our walk I'm a Christian this is what I do you know okay this will go on the internet but you know we we we my wife knows where I'm going here we we went walking along the Waterfront yesterday beautiful day you can't beat Wellington on a good day right having ice cream and all these things and you know my dad always makes this joke about Morris dancing who knows what Morris I don't have any pictures but you know Morris dancing um it's a it's a it's a British thing go Google it okay so we see these guys okay they are these old guys they got you know Old English guys or whoever and they're dressed up as moris daners moris Dan got a top hat on white shirt white pants they got Bells around their shins and they and and one of them play the accordion they dance around they hit sticks and they wave hankies and all these things and and and so so they're walking along the Waterfront and they're doing their thing serious man this wasn't a comedy act this is what the this is what they were doing they were part of a club and they had no shame in what they were doing they said this is our heritage this is who we are and my dad always makes a joke about moris dancing and I and finally I got to see it in the flesh and hey people be y you do you you're right but I'm glad I'm I'm glad I'm not a moris dancer but you see if they could if they anyway I I better quit but you know if they could do that with all seriousness and enjoy what they're doing and it's a silly folk folk dance from from England that looks ridiculous in my eyes Apex of their culture maybe I don't know but you know if they can do that with all serious just not ashamed how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ I mean arrayed in the whiteness of his righteousness amen filled with his Spirit walking according to his word how much more can we just go and and and be us in this world if they can do that and you this is eternal moris dancing ain't Eternal sorry I maybe get some thumbs down on that but you know on the YouTube but anyway you know if they can do that and not be ashamed of what they're doing how about you and I how about you and I amen because we know where we're going I don't know why I had to put that in but you know anyway let's just leave that alone but you see now he would say here he say what are these Lord then the angel talk to them saying and said unto me knowest thou not what these be I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with the shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so here is this man zerubabel and zerubabel actually means to come out of Babylon means to be a descendant of Babel we we know historically they came out of Babylon to rebuild the Temple but his name was I've come out of confusion right but God wanted to show him that may be how you've been named but this is not what you're meant to be you're meant to be the high priest this is what I've ordained you to be and so now when the Lord awakened um Zachariah out of sleep now his eyes came open to see that this great Mountain this great thing withstanding zerubabel coming to his position was going to become a plane and this is what an eagle anointing does Amen it makes something that's there look like it's going to be it's going to be gone who's with them who's with me this morning oh sorry I didn't even have that up forgive me right but you see now you when the eagle anointing comes of his word we begin to see sure there's an obstacle but when you look it through God's eyes that thing is what is that obstacle what is that thing what is that complex what is that unbelief or that hurt or whatever it mean it's going to become a plane that thing that hinders is going to become nothing you're going to walk over there like it's nothing amen and God's going to make it amen he says not by power by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord am mean so people that can see their in destination saying well if God's ordained me at you you at the wedding supper table to go into a Rapture amen then what can hinder me upon this Earth nothing that's the answer amen hallelujah now we understand that God shows us uh he shows us where we're going to end up in his word now now some of you won't remember this but us who were a bit older can remember a lot of us can remember where we were when we heard this happened do you remember where you were when you I remember I was in well it was fifth form back then I don't know what it is year 11 now I guess or something it was morning time this guy aliot Abraham in my dorm was running down the dorm saying they're bombing America and then the news came with this it was on CNN and we watched it the Headmaster gave a speech how the world's going to change and all these things but I remember where I was when this happened right as as brother Arman said on Wednesday a song or a picture like this can take you back in time now God wants to God God puts images in front of us not to take us back in time but to take us forward where we're going to end up right this is this is what the revelation of the word does he puts a God speaks in a story in a parable to open our eyes of understanding now this is Joseph meeting his Brethren now we know in the story before Joseph reveals himself to his brothers everyone has gone from the pal you know he he he tells everyone leave me so now we know Joseph before this happened he married a gentile bride so the Gentile bride where she is while he's revealing himself to the Brethren he's in the pal I mean she's in the palace as as brother bah teaches us now to the eagle now God speaks this picture to you and something in it says you're the bride in the palace amen that that before Jesus ever comes reveals himself to the Jews the Gentile bride is already gone hope this is okay this morning but God puts a picture before us like you know it can just be a sermon you know it can be a message you're listening to and God opens your eyes of understanding saying that is me amen it's like when you read the story of Esther and you realize I'm not hmon right I'm not even Mori there's something in you something in the bride of Christ that says you are Esther in this day that you've been positionally placed in the body of Christ to intercede for your family to intercede against the enemy Amen to actually make your make your claim before the Lord Of Glory that his wrath can be poured out against your enemy amen that we should never be afraid to go before our King not one moment amen but you see what's happened now is is they didn't realize you know his brothers did not realize who he was but when he spake I am Joseph then their eyes came open then I realized really where they are standing and and the dreams that their naughty little brother told them many many years ago has come into manifestation now if that can be just for a natural family how much more the supernatural family of Jesus Christ amen that's why this message has come to open your eyes of understanding I mean you can see I am the bride in the picture if you ever want God to work in your life start listening to the word start feeding on that message start listening and God will begin to pour Revelation it you will not remain the same you cannot remain the same if you want to draw closer to God listen to the time message read your Bible listen to the Bible don't don't don't sit there in darkness in a slumber and just go on in life God doesn't want you to be asleep he wants us to be awakened am mean he wants us to be awakened that he can use us in in our position he's ordained us to be in but you see the thing is we're all born with with spiritual Amnesia and even you know many times you know God can begin to deal with a child but then when they begin to hit puberty they go through you know teenage years you know then then then anamnesia can try and come on because innocence is left and you know Spirits begin to pull and desires come and you know the devil wants to pervert those things but you see God wants to bring us back to familiar places amen and many times there's things like you know like this story we may never you know I I heard a testimony of a brother um I think it's Richard Milligan or or Robert Milligan can't remember but he is a Pentecostal pastor but then he when he read brother Braham um um message on Joseph meeting his Brethren his eyes came open he was the bride in the palace changed his whole life right so so these things are familiar things that that there's part of us we already know we're already connected with but God has to awaken us to realize we're part of it it means it's like you know brother BR would tell the story in spiritual Amnesia of a I think it was World War I after that or World War II I can't remember which one but there's a whole bunch of soldiers that because of shell shock they had you know got amnesia they couldn't remember who they were then names where they are from and you know there's a whole bunch of them going in a train they're going to a mental institution cuz the Army doctors found out they couldn't help the couldn't help these men that had been Shell Shocked in war they are too many explosions had gone off had fried their brains and they just didn't know who they were and they were and they were going on the train they made a stop at a um train station and they let these men out and then the guards were watching them cuz they didn't want them to run off and you know just just um maybe cause trouble or get lost or whatever but but one guard noticed this one man he stumbled out like the rest of them but but then he began to look around and he was looking differently than the rest of them and then and then and then he began to walk off and another God was watching this and and and that God was going to grab this man and tell him to stop and come back but this other gu told him no let's just follow him and then so this then this soldier with amnesia began to walk and he you walked and he looked up he saw a water tank and something be to Dawn on him something in him knew where he was was mentally he didn't know where he was but something in him was crying out I've been in this place before I've walked this place I've seen this train station this water tank is familiar to me I've been here I can't remember when but something in me says this is near home they begins to walk down a path walk down another path then he comes to a gate of a house and he and he and he opens the front gate there's an old man standing there on the porch and he begins to walk down that walk down that path the old man runs down andrais and brother say when when his father you know that was his father when his father embraced him then then Amnesia was broken off that Soldier because the father said I knew You' come home son hallelujah what happened that Soldier was brought down familiar places it seemed haphazard and random that he ended up there but he was ordained to walk down that path amen that his eyes would come open that he'd remember who he was and friends is the same thing with this message amen it may seem halfhazard or random that it came your way maybe think well I'm just born in a family that believes that that's just no God ordained that you would be here amen that you would walk familiar places that maybe you say when have I walked this before the foundation of the world when God thought of you he thought of you as part of him part of his word amen and he knew he ordained you're going to walk this path in this flesh that you would know who you are amen this is what this word has done friends that's why I say we should be rugged in our faith we should be bold in what we believe amen we should not be ashamed amen that I came from God and I went back y I'm going back to God Amen why cuz God has caused us to walk familiar places amen so never ever let Amnesia try and strike you again this world wants to make you asleep sleepwalking but we ain't sleepwalking I mean we're marching to the beat of the Gospel I mean God has called us to walk a predestinated path and I tell you friends you may think well I only come here cuz I have to do let God speak to you one time let God deal with you one time open your heart to him it'll change your life am mean it changed Ezekiel all of his life your Camp brother Ben Bailey told him just just open your heart he sitting there wasn't even happy that he came to camp and basically his parents literally dragged him there you know but he opened his heart to the Lord God began to speak to him his eyes came open Hallelujah he became a Believer amen why because he let himself be impacted by the Eternal amen God himself Hallelujah I tell you friends it works it worked for me I mean I was an Amnesia sleep walking at University drinking and party and all these things but then one day amen I heard this message and God had to deal a lot of things but I let him change me amen I said Lord take me change my life take everything out of me that's contrary to your word that you can come and dwell in me I tell you friends he answered that prayer amen and God still changes and transforms Hallelujah Jesus amen I'm so glad we can do that amen I tell you it works and there's keeping power in him amen now I just want to draw your attention to to to Wednesday night I know this wasn't recorded but you know at the end of the prayer um brother Arman begin to speak about you know if you just uh you know he just begin to make some comments and I had it in my notes uh about this because it wasn't brother Arman speaking but the atmosphere just changed after prayer and God began to speak about if you could just just step into the fire and let it release you right who is here when that happened that you you when he begin speaking I realized this this is not him some people may be sat there saying well he's just making comments it wasn't him making comments that was the voice of God speaking amen and then we had a tongue's interpretation now this is the best we could compile of it I said I've spoken unto you this night do not fear believe my word have faith and believe if you knew what lay Beyond the Veil you would rejoice in the fire as you would see uh as you would see what it delivers you from and You' volunteer for it rest in the trial don't fear fear gives power to the enemy but Faith brings Deliverance amen so our friends I tell you if we could if we could just look Beyond the Veil this is why this message came to you for you to look Beyond the Veil I mean if we could just look Beyond these five senses and look beyond our troubles and look beyond what we're going through and now you know our stuff it'll all be gone you say this trial is so big it'll all be gone I mean it won't even be remembered one day it'll just be thank you Lord you brought me out of that thing thank you Lord you proved yourself in the trial amen so we shouldn't be now I'm not diminishing what anyone's going through that's big right but don't let it become a mountain when it's a mole hill compared to the delivering power amen the consoling power the leading power of our God Amen fear gives power to the enemy now I was thinking about that what you so instead of giving fear gives power to the enemy what about a Godly fear would give power to God if you take it vice versa we know we don't fear God Like We Fear the enemy but we have a Godly reverence right but if we let the Lord have power and Dominion in our life it would give power to the Lord I mean you know it says faith brings deliverance we got to realize that we're going through we're going through a a developing process this is why we should embrace the fire now you don't really see this much anymore but it used to be that's that's uh film here's a here's a history lesson Once Upon a Time digital cameras didn't exist not that long ago actually so you'd have film and you'd take photos and you couldn't just click you know you know get trigger happy only what 30 I don't know what it was on a roll not many she had to really you don't want to waste those photos right who's with me okay but then the thing is if you took that film and you rolled it out in the light it would destroy the image that's there so so so you took it into a photography place and they developed it in a dark room that's what that is on the right hand side that's uh a red light which doesn't doesn't damage the doesn't damage the film so in that condition in a dark room now the film can be you know it's put through a chemical process until that film is developed so the image that's hidden on that film comes out right in a dark room now this is exactly what God is doing now for us this world is a dark room right this compared to Heaven this place is a dark room right but there's an image that God took of you brother brah says he took a photo of you at your best and put it in his family album before the foundation of the world Amen so now what is he doing he's using this dark room to to to to bring out the image that he took amen so that's why I say praise the Lord for the fire there's a chemical process going on Amen it's fire and trial and all the Temptations and troubles and all these things but it's a process God is developing us into what he saw of us before the foundation of the world Amen that's why it says count it all joy when you come into trials Temptations and trouble amen don't be downcast you're going to realize Lord You're developing me in this trouble in this hardship in this question in this doubt in this trouble Whatever It Is God you're you're actually bringing out the real me hallelujah amen and he don't hold up any one of his Imes in the bright light and it's destroyed no he keeps it in the process until the vibrancy of the color the character of the word amen His Image is developed completely in you and I praise the Lord I like that don't you amen we are in a developing and he's the master photographer Hallelujah so I think you know it's easy to say but I think Lord change our attitude trouble strikes thank you Lord you can this is an opportunity to be developed Hallelujah you want to bring out something that could never come out of me if I never had this trial got this hardship thank you Lord got this question trouble even in the home whatever's going thank you Lord you're you're developing me through this process Lord amen praise the Lord now you see we God wants to break tradition God is a tradition breaking God now when Peter James I'm just I'm just doing a bit of a Segway here now when Peter James and John uh Jesus took them up what we call Mount Transfiguration and Jesus was transfigured before them and they saw Moses and Elijah talking talking with the Lord and then so while all this was going on Peter said Lord uh it is good for us to be here if thou will let us uh be here uh let us make let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias so what he wanted to do was was build three churches but you see God wasn't interested in in in building churches a tradition like a synagogue or something of the past he was there to build something new right because many times people will take a take something God did in the past they build a tradition around it but God doesn't want to do that because while Peter yet spake while he yet spake there's a voice came out a cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice came out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him so so God is telling them don't build churches based on a tradition of what you've seen hear the voice of the Lord amen so now and then and then when all this was over you know Jesus touched them and he said arise do not be afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only so there was a there was a something in man to to build something around something that God did in the past and brother R said when a messenger comes and then when he goes what happens is man makes a tradition of his life now we aren't called to make traditions of church age Messengers we aren't called to live around the tradition of the prophet's life though I value those things and appreciate it all but you see what was the purpose of the message was to hear ye him hear the voice of God am me that that voice would be transferred into a people then lived out it become a lived voice amen it would be something that's it be something that's lived not just spoken about but manifested amen and so because a tradition is something that's been handed down we ain't called to hand down a tradition see this is the danger of a lady see in church age just like it was when Jesus came it the synagogue turned into a tradition the Jewish religion turned into a tradition am mean you know people had their Community they had their you know this is my Rabbi this is the synagogue this is where I go this is what my family does and and instead of seeing the power of God the god of Moses and Elijah living amen that same one like Gideon inste if God be for us if God be with us where are the Miracles where's the reality of the great unchanging God instead of those kind of questions being asked they just well we have our tradition we're moses' disciples but there's no move of God to prove what they believed was actually real God don't want us to do that God don't want us sure it's great to have a good Community I thank the Lord that we have such a wonderful family here amen praise the Lord for everyone here right but we we don't want to just settle down with a good Community amen cuz church is more than just a community sure we need each other we're a body amen but why do we come together is that the Living God would come down and prove his word in our midst amen that the fire of God that fell at Pentecost would fall again today amen that the Living God would would Quicken us our eyes would come open that we'd see hey we're more than just part of a church amen but no we have a seat at the wedding supper table amen over in Glory Hallelujah just like you know to me it's like the reason why why Moses uh this is more than a burning bush but I you I'll get to this but Moses to me the reason that that that that God revealed himself as a flaming fire and a burning bush to Moses was more than just the fact that you know um um that that it was unusual but God was now God was telling Moses Moses I'm going to make you like this I'm going to set you flame cuz a bush is a tree right am mean men are trees amen we're trees symbolically in the Bible amen so so God was telling Moses Moses I'm going to set you a flame amen it's going to be more than just your ideas of how to deliver Israel but I'm going to set you as a torch amen I'm going to live through your life I'm going to prove amen my word that my word is right and true and I'm here to deliver Hallelujah then what happened on the day of Pentecost there wasn't one tree there was 120 in the upper room amen that fire came down amen filled them and then what they do they were set a flame by the Holy Ghost amen and they stepped out into the street began to preach and you know the people made fun but Peter just said this is that spoken by the prophet Joel in other words what Joel prophesied you're seeing the Fulfillment am mean so you're seeing your your it went from a picture in the Bible to a reality right in front of them amen but they became burning bushes full of the Holy Ghost you know the best thing to deal with anything is fire the best cleaning agent there is the best way to sanitize something is you burn it amen that's the best thing you want to you know maybe you you how how do they used to clean medical um instruments that set them on you know they put them in a flame why because it burns all the bugs burns out all the trouble am mean so they don't they don't work it out any other way and it's the same thing with us friends the best way to burn out the problems of life is fire the best way to get rid of it is the Holy Ghost and Fire here is the answer it's more than just psychologically working things out see an eagle will look to the end and say Lord you've made me in the image of your word this is my destination that's where I'm going Lord so father burn everything out of my life that I will match that image Hallelujah sure I've got trouble I've got hardships all these things instead of trying to put them in a compartment set it a flame well how do you set it a flame get G get immersed in the word of God and say God Quicken this to me as I listen Lord I don't just want to have an intellectual experience I don't just want to be able to just put it all together I want it to live Lord I want to change my life cuz tell you friends you get wood on the fire you let the Holy Ghost Fire come down you'll have a bonfire amen you'll have a Revival like you've never seen amen hallelujah and you know what I love about everyone here if you're not on fire you're tender dry Hallelujah I remember we went to um was it not last well was it last November we went to Brisbane or was it I can't remember when anyway the other November sometime we went there we stayed with um Jeff and betus they got a lifestyle block uh in land from Brisbane and they had just this little pile of uh scrub or uh you know stuff they've cut down they wanted to burn it and I'm thinking okay they're going to need petrol they're going to need you know to get it going cuz in here in New Zealand I've seen you I've seen like bombfire you know piles of uh stuff as big as this building on a Farms you know set on fire but they had to ignite it with some petrol and Jeff brother Jeff just took a match put it in and the thing just went I thought my I can see how these bush fires just like spread like wildfire but you see that thing's tended dry it's in a good environment it's in a good atmosphere it's not in a wet atmosphere it's not in a cold atmosphere it's not in a damp atmosphere it's in a dry atmosphere the sun's been shining I it's been preparing it to be set Ablaze amen I believe this is not a wet damp church I I believe we're not sitting in a refrigerator I mean we're not in a freezer of a cold atmosphere of an indifference and a you know no no love there's no faith there's no joy it's not you know clicks and stuff don't exist in this place I mean I believe this is a dry Sunny environment it causes us to become tender dry that the fire of God can come down consume out all of our problems Hallelujah so what does God want to do he wants to set us Ablaze with his holy ghost amen you know we have the Dynamics and the mechanics I know I've said it before but you know we have the mechanics of the word and the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and you know what I love about this age is it's God unlimited amen down through the church agees God was restricted by how much he could move by Creeds and dogmas kept the door closed but brother R says this anti message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people so therefore there is no limit to what God can do there's no limitation there's no restriction there's no there's no word of man that could hinder his moving he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants however he wants amen you can be driving in the car he can step in and change your life you're walking down the street getting groceries washing dishes you can be working you be at home you can be in church wherever and God can come down step in and transform your life meet your need amen cuz what does that do that's Eagle Vision Eagle anointing realizing he's the same yesterday today and forever I think if there's ever a time that we should let God have his way is right now amen because God has opened his floodgates of Heaven amen and pouring out his Spirit like never before and the Devil comes along and says I ain't seen nothing actually no you've seen a lot the devil knows God Lives the devil knows that God Lives in You amen but he wants to push that to one side to make you think you've got to overcome a different way I said no no why don't we go back to letting God fix our problems why don't we let God coming instead of trying to psychologically work things out and just let our emotions run wild run wild why don't we talk to the Lord about it and then let him fix it I'm all for counseling all these things you want to come talk absolutely but at the end of it what what be done prayer God comes down meets the need amen our God is the answer our God is the answer was he not the answer for your sin was he not the answer for your unbelief was he not the answer for your troubles am mean has he not picked you up out of the myy clay has he not been the answer that he said Lord I need Deliverance he says I'm your answer am me Lord I'm in trouble where he said I'm your answer amen has he not done it in the past amen will he not do it now and do it in the future absolutely God has not changed amen he has not pulled his hand off of you his hand is right on you he's with you amen he's for you Hallelujah so let him live amen let him do what he wants to do Hallelujah God hasn't forsaken you he is he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you you say well I feel as dead as a post that got nothing to do with our God Amen your feelings me nothing just say that God I believe your word I choose to say amen I choose to accept your deliverance I choose to accept your presence Lord I believe you Hallelujah and you'll begin to see God do the exceedingly abundantly don't be discouraged by what you see amen you imagine a young brother he turns his whole life against trying to destroy the work of God you know that was the Apostle Paul do you know he was a man under conviction the prophet said he was a man under conviction if we looked at him the wrong way and we just saw how he was fighting the church and destroying at doing all these things we get discouraged saying Lord I you the Lord Of Glory and look at what you're allowing to be done but if we looked at through Eagle Vision we say Lord thank you this man is acting up because he's under conviction hallelujah amen so when we look at trouble look at responses of people or family and maybe they just throw it back in your face you say Lord I believe they're under conviction Lord thank you Lord you're working thank you Lord there's a response coming from them cuz any response means there's an emotion moving there's thoughts coming amen there's there's reasoning coming and the reason all that's coming is God is knocking am mean God is calling amen so never be discouraged by the response you get you say Thank You Lord there's a response hallelujah amen everything works together for good praise the Lord you think so yeah you may think I'm crazy but no I ain't crazy I know where I am I know who he is that's the main thing praise the Lord amen hallelujah now let's just go down to well let's just go to this it's a question that comes up brother makes a statement he says he says in the third seal he says there's been millions and you know don't think we got revivals the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see It'll take these seven unknown Thunders back here to wake her up again this is what cause her to come come awakened these seven unknown Thunders now we understand from the Bible that when when Jesus was standing I'm just covering these things quickly because I want to get to something Jes Jesus would Jesus would say father glorify thy name uh but then there came a voice from Heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again and the people therefore that stood by and heard it uh said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him so then some heard as it a um as a thunder others heard the voice right so a so a thunder is the word of God not made clear now they could argue all they want about what it meant or that Thunder or what type of Thunder it was or you know all these things but those who heard the voice knew exactly what was spoken and there you say their eyes came open now when the Thunders are no longer Thunders but they a voice what does it do it awakens the bride and brother Rams asked a very simple question he says have the seven Thunders which equal the seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but as yet are not known to us as the Thunders yet he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about I mean so he say saying that those seven Thunders are no longer Thunders they're a voice amen so so it's been interpreted to you it's been made clear to you I trust I trust when you see or when you when you read Revelations 4 and 5 and the seals and things you see Jesus Christ redeeming you amen more than symbols more than horse riders but you actually see because remember brother raham said that that book of redemption he typed it as Boaz claiming Ruth same as the lamb taking the book am mean so he's saying now that that book when it's claimed it's actually Jesus Christ claiming you because you're part of that book Hallelujah why you talking about these things is because when that's reveal to you God saying that my Plan of Redemption is going to be completed in your life am mean I'm not just going to leave you guessing if you're going to make it or guessing if everything's going to be fine no I'm proving to you what I have done there amen is happening you on an age level is happening in your life amen that I have claimed you you're mine who's stronger than our God no no one so who can take that book who can take you out of his hand he said no can no one can pluck them out of my hand hallelujah amen so what does that do now now if it's this thing if if he's saying that the you know the bride has not been awaken you'll take these s unknown Thunders but the but now these Thunders have have have uttered their voices they're no longer a thunder but they're a voice now what is that mean it now it means the bride is having a Revival don't diminish what God has done in your life this is what I really want to get to don't diminish what God has done in your life this word has awoken you am mean it has quickened you it's made you alive you a Revival is an Awakening I mean like brother R would say about standing on Lake Michigan it's see the you know the lake churning up and the waves cu the wind is blowing and it's a a Revival is a is is a stirring of the waters amen it causes all the trashes in the lake to be swept out on the shore I mean so when the Holy Ghost comes down into the church it causes a Revival it causes an Awakening that you that water that's just like you know you look out here it may be dead flat out there at the moment I don't know but you know you just let that souly blow up the blow into the harbor it begins to churn you know trash is washed up on the bank why cuz the bay is having a Revival amen now it's the same thing with you and I friends is that when the Holy Ghost moves and that's why we should always be be so hungry Lord blow through this place sweep over my life Lord the logs and the trash and stuff in my life that maybe I don't even know there get washed up on the bank Hallelujah so amen so now we are living in a day of the bride's Revival we're living in this day we're not waiting for it to come we're not waiting for another messenger there ain't no eighth messenger I say there is one it's Jesus Christ himself he is the word amen he is this message he is the eighth messenger if I can say it that way so it's not a man that's going to come and make all these things clear it's already be made clear by the spirit of Revelation amen so now we so so so now the Bride of Jesus Christ embodies the Revival of this day amen praise the Lord that brother BR would would would speak about people going to going to Wales people from America would go and they're trying to find where is this Welsh revival going on and you know he would you know and and and these ones bumped into a bumped into a policeman twirling his baton and whistling a tuner I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them or I don't know what they are singing and they said good man can you tell us where the Welsh Revival is see they're looking for a church system that it would be that it would be allocated in but this man said he said he said uh yes Brethren you're standing in the middle of it they're expecting a building and a thing but no but but no he realized he had been awakened by the Welsh Revival that the Welsh Revival was sent because of him am mean that he was a dormant seed that was asleep but had to come awake amen so he realized actually no the Welsh Revival my good friends is not in a building it's in me amen he is the embodiment of the Welsh Revival now I say friends the reason this message came is to awaken you that you'd realize people say where is the bride's Revival happening at is it in Jeffersonville Tucson or somewhere say said no it's going on right here hallelujah I am the bride's Revival I have been awakened amen by this message Amen to realize that I am the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you ask me why I'm happy I've been awakened I'm not sleepwalking anymore I I know who I I know who I am I know where I stand I know who my God is I mean I know that he's here present to meet every need he's a God that proves his word don't be discouraged do not ever be discouraged the devil wants you to be discouraged trying to make you think that that mountain cannot move I say it will become a plane I mean that impossible thing that's been standing there for years you go look at maybe the Southern Alps or Mount R pay who you think that thing could never move who made that mountain God made that mountain am mean God allowed that mountain to be there I say the he actually allows the enemy to put mountains in your life cuz he wants to move that mountain he's in the construction business he likes to move Earthworks things that you think can never be moved no God wants to move it Hallelujah we got to realize God is here to move that mountain you say can it be done absolutely amen Jonah was in the belly of a whale he got out what did he do he prayed in Faith Lord be merci to me he moved the mountain of a whales Bley Hallelujah um Lazarus was 4 days in the Tomb that's a big mountain that's an impossible Mountain it ain't impossible to the resurrection in the life no he stood there said Lazarus come forth and we know if he did not call them by name there would have been a general Resurrection amen so that mountain was moved amen hallelujah Legion a thousand demons or however I think a Legions more than that that's a big mountain nothing could move it they tried to chain him up they tried to re itate him but what happened no he needed the mountain mover to step on the scene and and and set him free that same Jesus is here today amen he's living in our lives amen he hasn't changed he's the same in power and ability he is the mountain mover amen so now friends if he is that amen has he not awakened us to that fact amen so so what are we called to do we're called to respond in faith saying Lord you see this mountain you see this problem Lord I not satisfied with it being there Lord can you move it you it's exactly the same as Adam and Eve in the garden brother Brown would say there'd be like a cool wind blow and Eve would say oh I feel cold or I don't like it Adam would just say peace wind he controlled that thing it was the voice of Adam that controlled the wind cuz the second Adam controlled it right so now it's the same thing now in this day a Cold Wind Blows do you put up with it who loves to sit in a draft and it's not hot no one what do you do you close a window you close a door do something to remove the draft so if that's it in the natural why do we put up with drafts in the spiritual amen because you need Faith to believe when I close that door it's going to move when I physically you know apply Force to it right you believe you know it's like these lights when we turn them on we believe the switch there is going to turn these lights on brother R said it's that faith that applies the it's simple everyday common faith that applies the blood amen so so why do we sit there with a draft coming through our life just sad counting goosebumps you know counting the effects of the draft and looking and and trying to work out well it's this and this is the problem why don't we just get up in faith and close the door amen why don't we just do that amen we can God's given us god-given authority to deal with these things so I say friends if we've been awakened in this day should we not not should we not now act upon what he's given us or we going to sit in a draft I say no let's close the door let's close the door to the you know the devil blows the draft of doubts you've gone too far you can never be forgiven this is not for you you don't even have a hunger you know everyone's got a hunger for God it just gets put onto something else you know it's like you you know you have a favorite Lolly or chocolate or something yeah whatever sweet sa right but then you find something way better what do you do your desire goes to the better thing right because now you could realize well of course I don't desire this thing anymore because my desire's been moved right you still have a desire it's just been moved onto something else so people say I have no pull you I've God in my life I've got no desire no you do it's just been moved on to the wrong thing and if we could just identify that the morning you may feel well there's nothing in me for God it's because the devil's moved it onto something else so why don't you just let God say God I want that desire you've built in my life to come on to you and now Lord then then the Lord can begin to work again amen amen praise the Lord I'm just going to I'm just going to finish with this but nothing could conquer Christ he's speaking here from the pmos version he speaks about Napoleon and different ones he that descended is now ascended above all and unto him has has given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and has the keys thereof what he looses is loosed and what he binds is bound there's no changing of it he's loosed you sir he's loosed you you're free if you're free you're free Hallelujah he's bound you in the chains of his love if you're bound you're bound Hallelujah nothing if he's loosed you nothing can bind you things may try but they won't work amen can you look beyond the problem that's going on in your life you no he's loosed me amen there's no changing of it there's no conqueror before him there's none beside him he alone is the savior Redeemer he's the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ is his name don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you're ear too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and is yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail if God before us who could be against us amen so what's your Mountain this morning what's the thing you're facing let him make it become a plane let him cause you to look Beyond to the End Amen

are they dealing with as William would say the bad guys they're dealing with negative things all the day did it hinder his Revival no because he wasn't really he realized he wasn't really a policeman he was a son of God amen so he did not let the negative Dr steal his Revival CU he realized he was the Revival when you realize you are the bride's Revival trouble will come trouble will go hardship

10 15 years and we can look back at what camps were like and know you you ask the youth how was that youth camp was the best one ever and and it should be because the Lord's taking us higher and
