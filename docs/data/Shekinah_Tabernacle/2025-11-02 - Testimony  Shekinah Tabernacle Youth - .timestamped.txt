[0:18] This is a moment.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[0:27] Think I [music and singing] would see it
[0:29] hard to believe. Heaven crashes [music]
[0:33] to earth.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; I've read the story
[0:41] [music] of all that you've done.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Parted [music] the [singing] sea and set
[0:48] captives free. Never thought I'd be one.
[0:55] I [singing and music] am a living,
[0:57] breathing, walking, testimony. [music]
[1:05] &gt;&gt; I [singing] am the living pro of [music]
[1:09] what the Lord has done.

[1:15] They [music] call it crazy, but they
[1:18] don't take [singing] away my story.

[1:24] I am a living breathing
[1:27] [music and singing]
[1:29] testimony.
[1:33] that I wouldn't [singing]
[1:36] [music]
[1:38] that I should give up
[1:44] [singing and music] and know that the
[1:46] God that I serve is more [singing]
[1:49] than enough.
[1:53] He can move mountains.
[1:58] He can [singing] make broken beautiful.
[2:02] Never run out of hope when [music] I run
[2:05] to the God of miracles.
[2:12] I am living.
[2:14] [music and singing]
[2:19] I am living through. Heat. Heat.

[3:03] but the Lord had his forg God
[3:18] came to steal and destroy
[3:21] [music]
[3:22] gave it.

[3:32] What the has done
[3:36] with the Lord has done
[3:41] what the Lord has done.

[3:48] in your life. Over the course of your
[3:50] life, open up your eyes. Think about
[3:53] what the Lord has done. Oh,
