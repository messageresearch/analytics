think a few other sisters is that correct do there yeah yeah on I got you yep well God bless you everybody it's good to be here I love Camp everywhere you go there's a great atmosphere so I just appreciate that so I just wanted to do this song I don't do items very much but when I do I like to make sure that the Lord's in it otherwise what's the point so I just want to read some of the words from here and kind of open up a little bit of why he means so much to me so here's just halfway through the second verse I'll be up there anyway it's like the price for my heart I don't have a context for that kind of love I don't understand and I can't comprehend and it was like growing up like we've heard so much about the darkness and coming into the light and that's what we're coming into is the light and is brother Isaac preached last night and it's like I spent so much time in darkness and you never realize there's another way it's like not to be all sad and sopy cuz that's lame that's like like like I had Suicidal Thoughts From like 8 till 17 and I thought that was normal I thought like everyone had those thoughts it was just that's what was normal for me so I just appreciate like when you're always in stuff you can't see where you've come out of it but our testimony when we look back from where we came from and how for me it was so black and then you come and it's there's life and vibrancy and love and and in the bridge it just reminds me of where we came from my heart has been in your sights long before my first breath running into your arms is running to life from death and I feel this Rush deep in my chest your mercy is calling out just as I am you pull me in I know I need you now it's like that Rush deep in my chest like last night I was like I'm a human male I will not cry and then that rush comes into your chest and it just melts your defenses and you just can't not so I trust it's a blessing to at least one of you [Music] I've carried a bird for too long on my own I wasn't cre to Bear it alone I he your invitation to let it all go yeah I see it now I'm laying it down and I know that I need you I run to the father I fall into to Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to away my heart needs a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I'll run to the father again and again and again and again oh oh [Music] oh you saw my condition had a plan from the Star your son for Redemption the price for my heart and I don't have a context for that kind of love I don't understand I can comprehend all I know is I need you I run to the father I fall into grave I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart need a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I run to the father again and again and again and again oh oh oh oh again and again oh oh oh my heart has been in your sight long before my first bread running into your arms is running to life from death and I feel this Rush deep in my chest your mercy is calling out just as I am you pull me in and I know I need you now I run to the father I fall into Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart PS a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I run to the father again and again and again and again oh

done for us God has been so faithful and uh yeah I many of you may be able to uh relate to us but 2023 has been um a year of intense trials and um but in the same breath it's been a Victorious uh year

glory and the thanks for what he's done to to get us through this year and what he's continuing to do so uh we pray and trust that you'll be blessed by this [Music] song [Music] he didn't say that

specials amen you can just start playing um Lord we come to you and worship in a um we're just going to do one just one song tonight before we call up um to hear the word um tonight because we want to leave leave time for the word and you know we're already in an atmosphere you know sometimes near the start of the services you got to create the atmosphere but by the time you get to this part we're in the atmosphere already cuz music is to create an atmosphere um and I feel the presence of God here and and um two things I really want to reiterate what brother Ben the word he gave because I think that was from the Lord and you know to to to think about it tonight in the services think about their word sincerity just and search your heart you know it wasn't a coincidence I was thinking Lord I've got no I don't have anything coming there was just nothing nothing nothing right to the very end I thought oh well I'll just go with nothing think I think what's your word no word today but but that's God shown that he you know he he had a word and and and I just think we should be sinere tonight be real sincere cuz the spirit of God can really move when we are when we are sincere and and one of the sisters here said you know she said oh 2023 has been a hard year I don't know if it's just me but I've had probably the hardest year in my entire [Music] life it's been unusually hard and I don't know if it's just me or if it's kind of universal is but I wouldn't be surprised if it's Universal because the Lord's just working but you know when you go through trials and you go through hardship it it something comes out your faith does a sincerity does a reverence does a hope does it just something's happening in the spiritual realm that that the presence of God the spirit of God is is moving on his people and is is making something of them so let's um let's stand tonight and sing Lord we come to you and worship no matter what the circumstance and let's just worship God as as there um just partway through the song if we could [Music] have okay amen Lord we come Lord we come to you in worship no matter what the stand no matter what of the situation we will lift up [Music] ho H How We Love to Worship [Music] H just Worship the Lord this evening in sincerity and Truth him how we long to Worship You Lord we come Lord we come to you in worship no matter the no matter what what the [Music] situation we will live up Bly h h how we love to [Applause] wor h h h how we love to wor h h [Music] H how we love to worship [Applause] [Music] you we to worship you [Music] H oh how we long to Worship You h h h how we long to Worship You am let's just bow our hearts father that's what we come to do we come to worship you we come to give you praise I remember what your Prophet said if we sang in the spirit the spirit will respond back and I know Lord God you enjoyed the worship and the praise of your people this evening so Lord we come oh God to comeing to opening of Thy word and just asking once again you speak to the hearts of your people they didn't come to see a man and we didn't come to be seen but we come to lift up thee and father I just pray tonight you just speak to the hearts of your people as we commit everything into thy hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the church says am amen praise the Lord thank you musicians God bless you amen it's good to be back once again in the house of the Lord I would like to oh there we go let's turn to um Isaiah chapter 1 Isaiah chapter 1 and uh we'll go to verse 18 he said come now and let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet yes they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as waro if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it amen you may bece it also like to read Acts chapter 16 verse 25 acts 16 and 25 it said and it midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison was broken and immediately all the doors was open and everyone's bands was loosed and The Keeper of the prisoner awakened out of his sleep seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners have been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here praise the Lord God bless you this evening amen we we thank the god the Lord for the reading of his word we enjoyed the sweet songs of Zion we enjoyed the praise and we enjoyed the worship I know we might be a little tired and body uh this evening been a long day so we'll try to get through as quick as possible if the Lord would help us amen amen I just thank God for his grace and mercy you know God is a God uh that set he come to not bring us into bondage God come to set us free this message is our Jubilee to come and set us free do you believe that amen I believe that uh God want to set people free in this camp we come here for a purpose we come here for a reason and there's so many things to uh deal with and uh we just pray that the Lord will direct us amen um I I I read the scripture in Acts 16 for a reason because this is beautiful that this in Deliverance God got different ways of deliver amen God got different ways of setting people free sometimes you can just show somebody love and you can set them free sometimes uh you can just make a phone call say something is some body they can be in bondage of something it could set them free there so many so many little simple things but in this case right here they sing songs amen right here I'm always amazed with the Scripture it said Paul and Silas prayed yes at midnight they prayed sang praises and God and the prisoners heard them just think about this they're in a prison singing this isn't a prison like we have today I mean they didn't have prisons like we got today you can lift waks and play pool and watch TV and play cards and stuff that's not the type of prison they was in the prison that they was in their hands be locked when their feet be locked and they be sitting down and they be bowing they have rats and things running all around them and that's what kind of prison like a dungeon that they was in but in the midst of of all of that they was able to pray they was able to sing songs in the midst of all of that let me tell you sometimes brother and sister when you're going through something you can't even think of the word just start praising you can't even think of scripture just start singing because that could bring a breakthrough Just In Praise amen but the one thing I like about this the power that has been invested in The Believer sometimes somebody else can be bound but your action can set them free there's things that you can say and do and set them free like sometimes you come to church some people come to church and maybe had a hard day and work and things just W going right come in then when the worship service start and they sit there don't want to clap their hands or so forth that don't mean you shouldn't sometimes it just take you to start shouting giving God some praise and start singing and then the spirit move think about this in prison and the Bible said the prisoners heard them what you think those prisoners was sitting in there doing when they hearing Paul them saying they probably saying this is nonsense here we are locked up don't know when we going to get out and they going to choose to sing here's the thing about it brothers and sisters they might was locked up but Paul's Spirit wasn't in prison they Spirit wasn't in prison their body was there but their Spirit wasn't in prison and as they begin to sing I like the Scripture it say suddenly there was a great earthquake Quake not a small earthquake but a great earthquake but you got to understand this earthquake it ain't the earthquake that you and I would think it is I know up here in uh uh New Zealand you got earthquakes and some maybe be live and still active and so forth but you notice earthquakes use to tear up stuff right make houses sink make building fall and all these sorts of things but this earthquake right here was a detonated earthquake this earthquake had a special delivery from God because this earthquake it didn't shake the Earth this earthquake it shut foundations this earthquake when it was shaken it this earthquake was designed to make doors open this earthquake can we say Amen it only it made the doors open and then every B bands was loosed so this was a special earthquake sent from God so it could make change come come off so it can make doors open can we say amen and when God sunk that earthquake the doors open chains come out but you know what he made nobody step out the door they had to step out the door themselves God made the way but they had to step out themselves so when God speak to you in this service we can see chains come off you can see doors open but you got yourself got to walk out and say I accept what God has given me today amen you have to make that step praise the Lord that's why we need an earthquake and this Earth these bodies need a shaken in these bodies that's why the earthquake need to be praise God I just really love that scripture and it came by singing and praising if they can that can happen by singing and praising what about you and me when the lips is on your lips when the word is on your lips and you know what to speak when deity become on human lips again because this is the hour that we're living in can we say praise the Lord looking here at the scriptures and I want to read another quote here and we don't I don't take these things like me in the message come follow me but the man said here is what it is yes what's in the kid is going to come out no matter what it is it's got is going to come out this is a story when he was talking about he wish he can get his children just take them out there and live out in the wilderness and and the and somewhere and just keep them away from society he didn't want them to be around Society so he said but then as he thought about all that he said it makes no different what's in them going to come out that's why I was mentioned in the first service amen what inside of everybody going to to come out but we try to keep it in no let it come out whatever need to come out let it come out and then when it come out deal with it can we say amen he said listen what he said it's going to come out if it's evil in there it'll come out in the Indian Camp if it's good in there it'll come out in any Camp listen it's what's in the the kid the makeup of the kid what's on the inside of you and what you are now is what you are probably to be the rest of your life you're life you're on a changing spot now I want you to listen to this very carefully he said did you know what 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ is done before the are 21 years old 86% listen what he says it shows it statistics shows it 86% that come to Christ come before their 21 21 he said after you pass that age listen to it carefully now I I'm not saying that I just believe in what the prophet said evidently he's looking at something he's looking at something he said after you pass that age you become more molded and set in your ways isn't that the truth isn't it you know when children grow uh you know when your child is little you can tell them anything they believe you you can tell your son you can beat up Superman he'll believe it he'll as he grow up he'll tell everybody my daddy can beat up anybody nobody can beat my daddy he'll actually believe it because in that time of his life he's he he daddy is his hero he'll receive it but as he get older Daddy can say I can beat up Superman he'll go yeah right huh but at that time he'll believe it that's why we need to be like children when it come to the Lord Jesus Christ we'll take everything thing that he said we don't question it but he says this right here you become molded and set in your way now I like how he balanced it it's possible sure they come 70 80 years old but it's very rare he ain't saying it's not possible it is possible you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and as you think of it of course your mind is presented in your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind and when and when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do it and then your Ambitions drive you to it are y'all with me so far that's why you need to know be careful what you think even when you're young set your Ambitions and your heart on the right things not the wrong things I pray to God that tonight if you set free if you're not been set free from something and you're in bondage God can set you free even as the word Goes Forth I believe in altar calls I make altar calls but sometimes you don't have to come to the altar God can deal with you exactly right where you're at you can take the word yourself say God I receive it right now I'm I'm delivered right now I ain't got to wait till the end of the service I ain't got to wait for the last service to be preached I can be set free right now but sometimes people don't know how to be set free let me tell you something in the very moment God deals with your heart the Bible said when you hear his voice Harden not your hearts soon as God speak to you say God here am I I'm laying myself on the altar right now here am I I want to be free you don't want to be in abundance can we say praise the lord lord I pray a lot of things been missing in the in the gospel even in growth I challenge young boys to be men because it's important man supposed to be the strong one all right he supposed to be the leader can we say Amen how many of you young boys know you actually supposed to protect your sister let me ask that question again how many of your young boys know you supposed to protect your sister oh yeah Lord have mercy me take the jacket [Applause] off yeah turn me to the songs of Solomon H Song of Solomon 8 we just going to just I ain't going to hold you long but I'm just going to just now I'm going to preach on the power of reasoning I have permission praise the Lord I feel free to preach it now the beautiful thing I I even teach my son so whether they do it or not I still teach how did a young man ought to be protective of his sister that when some boy want to talk to her he can just step us and no I my daddy ain't going to appreciate that your sister might get mad you're not my daddy she yeah but I'm your brother and I know what Daddy taught me that you you know I'm going to protect you I'm going to do my job some of you like wellow I'll be hon with you sometimes in this time it's flipped around the sister protect the boy you see here the somebody bulli the boy you see the the sister beating up the bully and the boy like they ain't the way it supposed to be friends the man supposed to be the protector the man supposed to be the leader can we say man like the brother said it's time for us to rise and shine it's time for boys to rise up and shine to and be men we don't need sissies we need men we need Godly men that are stand at the Forefront to be and protect their families amen know how they daddy did things they I'm going be just like my daddy I protect my family I protect my sister Song of Solomon 8 it says we have a little sister and she has no breast what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken of this is speaking of a daughter A a brother saying I got a sister has no breast that means she's very young but now I ask you the question what should I do for my sister listen what he said if she be a wall we'll build upon her a palace of silver if she be a door we will enclose her with Boris of Ceda other words I'm going to protect her I'm going to watch over my sister until the time she is spoken up for that's where our young man should be can I get one amen amen but here's the problem some boys actually catch that Revelation they'll watch over their sister some boy try to talk to no she be she be trying to say something you know no you Ain she might you out my daddy no no no but then the problem comes a boy try to like her he got a sister now he Tred to protect the sister but now he see a girl he likes and the boy likes his sister then he breaks his his defenses well you can talk to my sister if you let me talk to your sister and we still got it in the circle with protection no we need men in this message with a revelation with a new birth cuz they know one day I'm going to have a family you know uh I got a son-in-law I got a daughter-in-law but my my my son-in-law's my son-in-law I just be honest with him amen when he decide to like my daughter see it make no difference how much you like a a man you can say brother I appreciate you and I love you be in the same church or whatever he likes you and shake your hand but soon do you say Sir see Hey brother what is could I talk to you about something his defenses goes up he say what is it well ain't no need to laugh and get to the point well sir I've been praying uh I like to get married here really to who I see you don't don't be trying to speak in tongu no just just be honest with the brother sir I've been praying and and I I like your daughter whatever now that brother that used used to be so kind to you and sweet to you all of a sudden he changeed on you do you know what that is that's defense that's his girl his daughter you asking about now all of his defenses come up and he looks at you differently don't get mad brother he got a right to do that that's his daughter I tell all young boys when they get married I said wait till you get a daughter I said when you get that that's I ain't the boys it's the daughter I said when you get that daughter one day you going to be playing with her her little fingers in your mouth o you going to be bouncing on her lap and then one day a thought going to come she going to get old one day and some boy going to like her while you bouncing on her lap you going to start getting mad that's automatic it's automatic that's what a man does cuz that's his daughter you see some of you young girls get mad at your father when some boy seem to kind of like you and then daddy do his investigation daddy say no you be like I'll never have nobody daddy keep running them all sometimes you ought to be thankful daddy run him off because a man knows a man when they know he's up to no good yeah we going to run him off that's the way it's supposed to be you ought to say Daddy loves me because he ain't going to let anybody just come in my life cuz when a man gives away his daughter he do not give her a away to s he gives her away trusting that this young man is going to take care of her better than what he did the same are better amen say I like to get married first question are you born again first one next one where you work I work here how long you been working there s said well you work before there I worked here how long you worked there

little Escape no you take care of your responsibility first to show stability these things are important a man has a sister do you realize when a boy wants to marry you and you say yes what you saying I now trust this man to take care of me that's emotionally financially I trust this man that's really what you're saying now he's unstable himself how is he going to help you see the Holy Spirit brings stability in a man's life in a girl's life it brings that stability some of you boys like you want to throw a rock or something at me no I'm telling the truth cuz this is a perfect message yeah it bring mature Sons and Daughters of God y'all don't understand the opportunity you got to start things right do things right and in right praise the Lord me and my wife didn't have that opportunity we didn't come up in the message we didn't come up in church we come from the street but this message made us what we are today amen I didn't have a father to teach me I didn't I didn't have a mama to teach me but this message Jesus said I'll be a father to you I'll be a mother to you I'll be a friend to you this message made me what I [Applause] am praise the Lord that's why I challenge a young man to be a man I love to see a young man just get to such stability in life and then the get the father gives him permission and so forth as he go on in life I I like to see a man this is me now I like to see a young man even wedding time come he can say sir I can pay for my own wedding all right if you want to help fine but I got it I've been working on this I've been planning this I've been preparing this H are you going to get married and take her take her back to your parents' house Jesus gave us a better example than that what did he tell his bride I go prepare a place for you so when you know you're going to get married youall got to have something prepare so you can take her to there praise the Lord huh sisters what about you when God brings a woman and a man together he do not take a woman woman from a man's head for her to lead that man she don't take the he didn't take the woman from a man's foot so that man can step all over her he took her from the side a rib do you realize sister if you if a person don't have ribs in their body you know what happens it slums there's no structure and what do your ribs do your ribs protects your vital organs so sister when you marry a man God took you from the rib your place and your position is to protect his heart protect his emotions protect his feelings give him stability strengthen him because in the Bible when they want to kill a man quick they hit him in the fifth rib so you can kill him quick or you can bring him up quick huh so that position falls on you sister when that man come home from work grumpy no nobody want to be around him sometime the devil don't even want to be around him they be so grumpy can you as a woman see that man condition say hold on a minute let me change the atmosphere let me change the atmosphere pull him back down did not the prophet said it's a wonderful thing when a man can come home to his Queen Hall hallu but what if he come home work hard tired then he finally make it in the house but when he get in the house here goes Queeny oh oh oh you back oh dinner be ready in a minute microwave hey marriage is not try out friends it's something you pray about the prophet said pray about these things is because you can ruin your life if you mess it up praise the Lord I want you to notice Isaiah well proverbs 30 first Proverbs 30: 12 says is this there is a generation that appear in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their ftiness that's a strong scripture this is this generation that we're living in that P in their own eyes where do that Spirit come from it come from Le theia it's an anointing on the L of sin age to make people think they're pure in their own eyes but don't realize they're blind naked and miserable but that's why God sent this message for you and I so we don't be p in our own eyes we want to be peing his eyes not our own eyes what we read in Isaiah 1 reasoning but I want talk about the power of reasoning because you can't take the thing lightly God reasons there's a good reason and there is a bad reasoning how many you know God reasons let's see how God reason which we already read it God said this come now let us reason together that God going to reason with me yeah see God he can reason with me come on all right God let's let's let's just do this let's do this and God says although your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be like Crimson they shall be be as wo if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land god reasoning but if you're noticing God reasoning he don't ask you what you think about it he tells you this is how it's going to be you either do this or that but we want God to reason say Lord you know my heart I know you understand me now Lord I know what I'm going to do is contrary to your word I know that but you're a loving God and you know my heart you think God listen to something like that no they say oh brother brother preacher happy man Family Camp preacher happy no I'm going to preach you the truth exactly what I'm going to do I'm going to preach you the truth I come here to please one person and it ain't brother Ben it's Jesus [Applause] Christ I appreciate it people I enjoyed the service I enjoy I appreciate every bit of that but what I look for if God say good job son I want my okay from him cuz that's what it means to me it means so much to me reasoning let's look at the definition the definition of reason it means the process of forming conclusions judgments or inferences from Facts or premises the act of process of reaching a decision or conclusion so when you reasoning about something you actually got to find a conclusion where you can say this is it this is what I'm going to do now I don't reason it out but then that's what Webster says but when I look into the message the prophet give his definition of reasoning this come from the message the conflict between God and Satan he said but God can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when man makes a decision has to ever remain that way he said I'm sorry when God makes a decision it has to ever remain that way and I'm so glad the prophet put it that way he he always makes statements if God save a man one way if another another person meet the same recommendation God will have to do the same thing for him that's why I'm so thankful when you're going through something in life he said in the message uh experiences I believe it is no identification he said when you're going through something find a character in the Bible that you can relate to and whatever God done for them he'll do the exact same thing for you [Applause] praise the Lord if you're sick got an infirmity in the body go back to the scripture when the woman touch the him on His Garment your Revelation should be stronger than hersl cuz we got evidences we got proof but this sister didn't even have scripture she had no scripture but she said if I can just touch the hym of His Garment it wasn't the h m h e m what she got it from it's the s i m h i m him what she got her healing from praise God he's the same yesterday today and forever the theme of the message the prophet ke just telling us what he done back then he the same God he'll do the same thing right now praise God he says Satan took reasoning he took the reasoning and attacked the word see a reasoning Spirit it attacks the word he says and Satan took reasoning took the reasoning attacked the word shook Eve off the path that's right by reasoning human reasoning could you just imagine when the serpent came and talked to eeve can I ask y'all a question when had the devil ever stopped using scripture never he always used scripture he just Twisted it he told eeve surely you won't die look how he throw s how he throw it all he came to eeve First religious he said yay God has said I see eeve this brother been in church he he quoting God so he he got something he used the word of God it ain't no different today how you don't got so people don't get so slick around this mess they always use the word of God but you got to catch the Twist and you know the story she tell him what's going to happen and then he just said surely you won't die now think after the fall took place after the fall took place then that reasoning could still hold Eve after the ACT took place she can say wait I'm not dead God said surely I would die but I partook of it I'm not dead in the serpent see God was wrong you're not dead but yes you was spiritually and then later on it manifest physically exactly what God Said was going to happen it happened that's why a lot of time what reasoning do when people reason against the word you tell them don't do this and then they reason their way around it they still go do it and it seem like they prosper and everything all right see I don't see nothing happen I'm good no that's qu it's just a matter of time it'll walk you down because the word is true you know the children of Israel the situation they got in after David had died Solomon became king what caused Israel to even split what caused the enemy to be able to get into Israel you know who was caus of it Solomon because the law said Moses law said do not marry strange wives said if you marry them they will turn you from serving the lord Solomon thought that cause he is the king with so much wisdom he can bypass that and it won't affect him but he did it he broke the law but what did they do Solomon got married mared what thousand see God still with me I'm good I still love the Lord I'm still serving the lord so the law of Moses don't work on me but you know what they did they just waited they waited for him to get old and when when he got old Solomon yes dear I want an altar for my God yes dear so the scripture is true when you reasoning around that you think you're getting away from it it'll catch up with you it will catch up it might take a matter of time but it'll catch up that's why we're not here to preach fear I'm just trying to show you how powerful that reasoning spirit is cuz I have to deal with it I'm not saying I'm immune from that sometimes situation come up even in the church reason and say really be careful you don't want to hurt the person and you need to do this you don't want to run them off for the church and you just be need to be care reasoning comes but you know what I do whoa what the word they broke the word yes let's go back and to the word say what they did we'll make the decision from there because the word is the absolute are we all [Applause] right he said now the only way that she could have got to disbelieve God word it had to be a pilling Satan knows how to make reasoning appealing it has to appeal to you sin is very appealing there's only one sin and that's unbelief so it is really appealing Satan makes it appealing so he began to talk about reason he said reasoning is appealing then he comes down in the message take on the whole armor of God I'm just giving you the definitions the prophet gave he said notice Satan tried to get in there to spy out to see how he could get a hold of that human race cuz you remember the devil know he can't create but he had to find a way to get it to the human race he had to do that and this is what he was looking for he knew he could not get to Adam Satan knew that I ain't no need to be bothering this man but when he seen Eve come to the picture he said I got Avenue I can work with now he took one of the most famous tactics well it showed that he had to be a supernatural power to think of it he even telling Satan had to be a supernatural power to even think of reasoning you got to remember sin didn't start in the book of Genesis sin started in heaven what what makes us think we can take this Christian Life easy lightly when this devil in heaven in a perfect place he was able to deceive angels in a perfect place in the presence of God he was able to go right in there and tell him a lie and deceive them that's the power that that devil got but look at the look at the confidence God got in his bride they was in a perfect place and fail now God will put you and me in the worst age and he say we won't fail that's the confidence he got in you and me why won't we fail cuz we'll stay behind that word we won't reason with it if God said it that settles it amen I hear people say all the time God said it I believe it that settles it no sir God said it that settles it whether you believe it or not it's still settled God's word has been settle in the heavens the Bible tells us Satan tried to get there he said it showed he had to be a supernatural power to think of it he used this the first time and was successful he's done it ever since still successful to a certain estate he used reasoning against Faith Satan came to Ed to begin to reason against the word of God the great armor that God had fortified his people with he be to use reasoning it's only reasonable that God would not destroy you surely you will not die but remember friends that Satan taed it to begin with he still uses the same thing and still successful with it reasoning hallu as he begin to go on down about reasoning in the message the uncertain sound he said reasoning cast down reasoning that's the scripture we read at the first service when in Corinthians said cast down reasoning anything that would exalt itself above the word of God just cast it down when something is against the word of God you know it don't try to reason around it just cast it now that's just that simple but what makes it so hard sometimes when the devil presents something to you so tempting then you want to try to find a way around it he says this cast down reasonings cast them down God don't want you to have reason he gives another definition reason always tries to find a way out out from what word he says this Faith don't reason Faith just believes your mind what makes you reason it's a liar the liar detective proves that God Bible First proves it but your soul is Immortal brother sister he said your reasoning power will leave you When Death strikes you but your soul will be with you through eternity won't you believe God works today and accept him he's pleading so reason tries to find a way out a trumpet gives an UNS un sound he said now the enemy spy Satan tried to find out what he could do to break into that so he know he just can come out and Bluff her talking about Eve so the only thing that he could do was to to get her on reasoning he said God uses today to fortify his word is the church is his word Satan comes around with reasoning power Satan know that was the loophole that was the place people would break the easiest was that reasoning reasoning makes you break makes you give in you can't take the pressure so you just say I just go ahead let it be I just can't take this we can't do that brothers and sisters we stay on that fortified word we stay with what God bring us today stay there and let watch God go to work so reasoning make break the easiest was it reasoning take on the whole arm of God he said when Jesus of Nazareth was here on Earth he never used his power yet he was God manifested In the Flesh he never used his power when Satan come against him I like that Jesus very easily could have smoked Satan right out of a but he would have done that we wouldn't have nobody to fight we wouldn't have nobody we would we wouldn't have an adversary we want to have somebody to make us stronger Satan is a worthy adversary he studies you he studies me he knows your weaknesses them are the place you have to protect all your weak spots you need to protected with the word of God cuz Satan actually studies you Satan knows how you built up some people are built up on emotions just built on any little thing can just shake them and bother emotional person so what the devil will do keep bringing things in to mess and shake up their emotions he'll find thing make sure you run into thing that is going to disturb your emotions cuz he studied you some people got bad complex problems so the devil make things happen so they keep continue to get complexes and can't break through them huh praise the Lord like a boy say man look at me I'll never get a girl look at me flabby arms I can't get a girl like that I got to do something sat say yeah look at you look at you you're nothing I know what I need to do get in the gym get in the mirror she going to like that I'mma have some guns he rcking on a complex Satan say you need to change your dress look at you look so oldfashioned look at you so yeah I need to change clothes what happened get in the Facebook get in the movies videos watching how Mr Cool dress then come to church like he the cleanest thing in the church and don't realize he let the devil use him with a complex Sur I got a new suit new shoes new tie when I walk in church everybody going to look at me yeah they probably be like what don't happen to him then when you don't get the response you want you walk out of church just let the devil use you like that it don't have to be that way let me tell you what beauty is let me tell you what hen is anybody how of just fill with the Holy Ghost is beautiful and [Music] handsome exactly [Music] right praise God reasoning it makes things he said it makes it appealing reasoning make things appealing that's how it does things let me just keep going on here cuz I really don't want to hold you long I want this just to be a impact so that when the enemy try to comes and try to get you to go around the world you got something you can just withstand them say say I know exactly what you doing it ain't going to work let me show you how the spirit according to the definition the prophet gave I want to show you how it works turn with me to Matthew chapter 21 reasoning always tried to find a way out and know it can make people break the eases and reasoning is appealing that's a very bad spirit in Matthew chapter 21 let's go to verse 23 when Jesus was coming to the temple the chief priest and the Elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what Authority does thou doest these things who gave thee this Authority they asked their wrong personal questions when Jesus answers questions it makes mouths be shut they can't say nothing back all they can do is just get mad and walk away that's the way Jesus does things is that right look at his response Jesus answered and said to them I I also will ask you one thing not two or three one thing just I'm going to ask you one thing which if you tell me I am likewise will tell you by what Authority I do these things he said the baptism of John went was it from heaven or of man wow that's a powerful that's a powerful thing now what and they what reason see when a reason spirit is challenged it got to freeze for a moment let me tell you something about a reasoning Spirit a reasoning spirit always know what the truth is it always knows that's why it'll try to find a way around around it watch this they reason with themselves saying if we shall say from Heaven he will say unto us why do you not then believe but if we shall say Amen we Fe the people for all hold John as a prophet now let me tell you when a reasoning spirit is trapped the best way it tries to escape is tell a lie watch what they do they don't reason it all out but then they said answer to Jesus said we cannot tell but they actually could see let me tell you when you didn't even want a child you know we inherit by birth a reasoning Spirit you do know that right it's automatically it's an automatic default it just there that's why when you're dealing with a child and the parents they don't done something wrong and the parents decide to talk to them and the parent begin to ask questions uh why did you do why did you do this they'll go what they already know what they did what I do you know what you did no explain then the parent begin to break it down what they did they go I I don't know why see that reasoning Spirit now this is what children do when they done got in trouble on something and they know eventually Mom and Dad going to find out yeah what does start reasoning that reasoning Spirit come say I could go to Daddy but if I go to Daddy this is what he'll say and if I go to Mama this what she would say I think I better go to Grandmama [Applause] sweet old grandma Grandma can we talk yeah baby I got in trouble no and and I didn't mean to do it I didn't mean to do it she said what you what you do baby I just done some things I shouldn't done I've been talking to boys and they've been contacting me and sending letters and all kind of things and I didn't I didn't mean to do it grandma she said oh baby I know you did then all of a sudden Grandma talks to Mom and Dad you know that's your child I know and I'm not telling you what to do but sometimes you have to have Grace with the children and then the child be like get him grandama get her yeah see what Grandmama don't realize the reasoning Spirit jumped off the child and no jumped on her that's why we need grandmas in this message will take that child no you wrong you're wrong now come on I'm going to take you to your parents I'm going to expose you that's how it should be you remember the prophet said you if you got a little kid keep want to go over Grandma house and stuff like that probably it's a bag of candy or something see reasoning it'll make you bounce around to get the answer you want not what you need but what you want so they told a lie to a lie it's the same thing with the word something come up in your heart you want to go do it then first thing God will always visit you with truth he'll always visit you with truth but now he can't make you receive it now it's laying in your lap what I'm going to do this or what I ain't gonna do it reasoning I ain't really got to where I'm going just few more minutes that reason in spirit today is so powerful you get some girls I sure want to get married but these boys in this message are not mature I know this boy is a Baptist I know he is a Baptist but he he's just mature I know he ain't in the message but I can get him in the message he just got a good job car money everything this brother in church still at home now Lord you said marriage is Honorable that's your word Lord you said marriage is Honorable so what's wrong I just want to get married de now y'all don't got real quiet I'mma tell you why you got quiet cuz you know I'm telling the truth reasoning it's a power then your ambition set 10 I got to get married I find him somewhere I just got to do I just I got to work a way I got to work a way around this to get him to meet my parents and stuff I just gotta gota work away around Church Pastor be like oh I see we got a visi in church and everybody else hey man praise the Lord then you be like see you want to be religious with it get him to come to church she all think I'm joking no I'm not joking that's what reasoning does reasoning plans everything out you remember when David did wrong yeah when he got NE when he went to B Sheba what did he do he said hey this girl this woman is pregnant I got to get this man home so I can blame that on him I got to find something what he joab how War he said why would you to put this brother on the front line and so for like that it's do that for him everything seemed innocent and then the brother said yah said how can I be home with my wife and you Breen out here fighting he said not me David said so reasoning come again find the hottest place of the battle is put him there see reasoning makes you manipulate it makes you manipulate till you can get your agenda fulfilled right then you know the story and then David thought he was scot-free thank you reasoning you help me out of that one I'm good to go but he didn't realize there was all I allseeing eye was watching everything and here come Nathan the prophet David yes you know the story that David start getting hot where is the man what who could do something like that to the poor little sheep where is he he said you he thought he got away but God caught him now go read Psalms 51 cuz David wrote that PSAL because of what he did when he say create in me a clean heart that's when David wrote that song because he after he got rebuke but if you listen to the psalm what David is actually saying he's pleading to God he said in sin did my mama conceive me right why is David saying that how could his mama conceive him in sin when it was a sinful act when his mama and his father was married what David is appealing to God he's telling God my first nature I done this because of this nature that is in me this is why I did he said God I ain't blaming nobody I sinned against you so David laid the whole platform to God this is why I did it then he said creating me a clean heart why did he say that he said because I showed you why I did it because of this first nature the way that I was born and if you don't change my heart I'm going to do it again that's how you approach God God I got a problem and if you don't fix me with this problem Lord I'm going to do it over and over and over again but if you approach God the right way God said we going to put a stop to it right now I'm going to empower you to put a stop to this right [Applause] now reason praise the Lord I tell you I'm reading all of this to just get to one story and I know you don't heard your pastors quote this story over and over and over again but I'm going to I'm going to quote it it's about that woman that was on her deathbed thinking she was going to heaven and she didn't you remember the story how many of you young people are familiar with that story I'm not just preaching to young people I'm preaching all of us how many you remember this story you got to look at the impact of that story CU At first she was a good person the prophet say she was raised up right raised in a good family raised in a good home all she had all of that in the church playing the piano good person but one day she moved to a church that was a little looser than the one that she used to go to and where she messed up at going to a looser Church watching the way the women dressed and see nobody was saying nothing she begin to say what's wrong with it see that's why we as ministers we we we call black black white white we just preach it all we preach revelation we preach Doctrine we rebuke we do the whole nine yard we don't keep our mouth shut cuz when you keep your mouth shut on certain things people begin to think it's okay she ain't nobody saying nothing so I guess it's all right because a group is going one way that don't mean it's right can we say amen God want you and I to be able to stand alone not with the group that's why Micaiah he didn't let them pressure him Mah 400 400 Micaiah they are saying the same thing why won't you stop trying to be different Micaiah just say what everybody is saying Mah said nope whatever God tell me to say that's what I'll say so you can't go by groups you got to go by what the word say if you going to talk about him skipping the story when she moved away moved to another home the neighbor cutting grass she just kept looking over there maybe saying hello neighbor hello neighbor hello neighbor and then she finally W up leaving her husband got with the neighbor see some sometimes you think conversations is so innocent but there's a spirit behind words if the word of God is spirit and truth even the words you speak carries a spirit and it just start by conversations I'm not calling nobody in here Slicker but I just want the sisters to know how they work you might ask yourself a question how brother brother how do you know all do cuz I used to be one when I was in the world when you yourself got a little problem feeling lonely and down your continence tell on you you just minding your business and them Slickers out there that's what they look for they look at you h if you even got a job I'm just giving examples you own the job he comes by's they target you all along see another thing you young girls don't realize a person in the world can identify you easy because sitting in this message because you're upon an anointing it actually gives you a different reflection and somebody that's not in the word that can pick that up you just minding your business and on the job say Hey you say oh hey hey that might have be all he say for three days and don't say nothing else to you and you just minding your business minding your business come back the next thing you all right today oh I'm fine he don't say nothing else they come back again are you sure you're okay he said yeah [Music] why well I'm used to seeing you happy bubbly on the job and but you seem to be a little down so I got concerned you know I cuz you when I see you with joy and happy it kind of makes me happy too you know really really now you like I do have a Ministry slick man slick that's all it takes and you know what's going to happen when you used to be late the were barely getting there now you there early start watching how you dress when you used to go to work any kind of way now you just really watching it cuz what don't happen his words are getting in here yeah now he on the job you walk by hi he said oh hey how you doing you man he acting different he used to be a little Jolly let me go see something wrong with him are you okay yeah y I'm fine communication communication and there go that reasoning he don't seem to be a bad guy he ain't in church but he got discernment he was able to see something was wrong with me that's the kind of man I want in my life can pick up my needs and something wrong with me that's that's what I want that ain't nothing but the devil that's all that is and before you know it what church you go to oh I just uh go to this Pentecostal Church oh you're Pentecostal oh we are we know we Pentecostal AP not denomination but we believe he oh really I can go with that you can't I can go with that then religion got to come in cuz he know you a church person so now he got to approach you with religion the same way the serpent did Eve but you open up the door and once you open it reason comes in and strengthens you to be able to get around things it gets worse then you go around one of your sisters in the church can I talk to you about something yeah what is it you know this guy on the job let me tell you something parents I'm always go ahead and bust your bubble when you got children on work or even in school if they come home keep talking about a certain person that's usually the one they like you sitting at the table eating dinner and your daughter say yeah this dude name Johnny at school he just so funny he's just so funny you said Johnny oh okay next day you eating on the at home at the dinal table Johnny he just said something to me the other day you said Johnny said that no she's telling you who she likes friends I'm telling you we dealing with Spirits how many you know the Devil is a friendly Devil he's a friendly devil he don't come out and spook you know he come that what makes him a deceiver he know how to blend in but you got to catch what he's doing praise the Lord before you know it talk to your friend he just seemed like oh the killer word he seem so sweet what's so sweet about him and then and and and it feel like we have chemistry no no no ain't chemistry that's lust that's what it is lust and the devil is right in the midst of it and if you keep continuing that route you going to get yourself trapped in more and more things it's going to be hard to get out of I'm just giving you a fair warning that's our Spirits work can I have a few more minutes but I'm then this story here but B said so this woman finally fell in love with the man the neighbor and she left her husband ran off married this man continued playing the piano in the church and after a while she left him marry another one she thought she was doing all right and then finally ended up as a common law wife he said what was it her soul told her in the beginning don't do that but she reasoned that's why I make the statement earlier God will always present truth to you but he ain't going to make you believe it he said her soul told her that was wrong the reasoning said ain't nothing wrong with that and as The Story Goes he said this is what she begin to say now if the rest of the woman can do this why can't I do it but down in her soul was the spirit said don't do that keep away from that that's not right but yet she fought against that and cast that aside and she went to reasoning don't you see don't reason just believe believe God's word don't try to reason it out just what God Said is the truth and believe that to be the truth and don't go to your reasonings go to your experience to Christ in the heart compare it with God's word but it gets worse this Spirit had trapped her so bad till she continued to play the piano in church just as religious as she can be and it told her there is nothing wrong with you and she honestly believe it he said now she went on and after a while she was called of the pastor of the church well this is I'm skipping a lot for time sake this is when she was on her bed laying on her death bed he said now she went on and after a while she was called or the pastor of our church was called to her bedside to pray for her wow she was laying there smoking cigarettes and everything Liv in this house a come in-law wife and he said sister is everything all right with your soul to die she said everything is at peace he said now she believed it she had went so long with her intellect until she had grieve the Holy Spirit from her if you battling something struggling even with the world do I want to step a little more farther in the world and still being in church if you battling with that stop battling with it you know it's wrong up front so don't battle with it here is where the battle is at the Battle Is you want to live two lives you want to live the way you want to live and yet go to heaven it don't work like that you got come to a place in your mind and be honest say Lord I'm struggling I'm struggling with the world I got things I want to do places I want to go things I want to work I'm struggling with it Lord but God I know it's wrong will you help me will you just help me Lord I promise you he'll help [Applause] you you say God I don't done this I don't done this God said I don't care what you done I just want to know what do you want to do right now because the devil tried to hold you in bondage look what you done look what you said look at that you're no good you're not fit the devil want to hold you in bondage and reason to tell you you're no good but you know what let your face ride up in the word and say God you are forgiving God you are a redeemer you can restore me you can bring me back to where I need to [Applause] be so that's why I'm not here trying to beat you down or put you down I'm just showing you how them Spirits work but great is he is still here God is still here and set you [Applause] free don't grieve the holy spirit away from you don't sit in church service after service knowing what the preacher preaching the truth and keep rejecting it I put up offense against it don't grieve him away don't grieve him away don't grieve him receive him he says she geve the Holy Spirit from her it no more spoke to her she didn't know which was right she had reasoned it out she had a mental conception that if she went to church and did what was right why she would go to heaven that's a mental conception well reasoning look this is what reasoning do sure you're not living right you know that but at least you go to church that's what reasoning though why do they keep messing with you they ought to be thankful you in church yeah you living wrong but they ought to be thankful you in church see you got to block all that out reason is just going to keep your religion religious but put a block on your soul he says this she had a mental conception that as she went to church did what was right while she would go to heaven that went on down to the very hour of her death he said but when her reasoning power when you die your brain breaks up of course when the spirit leaves you and then what's left he said here's your soul that you neglected back here which comes to you then when you're dying notice he said your souls come to you when you're dying so a reasoning spirit is to keep you in bondage till you start dying on your deathbed it want to keep you there are y'all with me am he said and this mental reasoning breaks up you don't reason no more he said it's your soul that's been in your heart that you grieved of way then it caught up with you and when she did she screamed my God I'm lost too late then the Soul that had been grieved away see when that reasoning telling her that she was okay it left her now now her soul come up reasoning told her she's okay but her soul told her you're lost and look how it trapped her just do simple reasoning but it becomes a power and then it gripped her when you people leave the word most I what I seen when they leave the word if they got Facebook they start posting their pictures on Facebook but how much fun they're having now and if you ain't careful you get on Facebook looking at their fun you was like wow I have never seen them this happy not even in church but they so happy now they seem so free now then reasoning come is this me devil want to block that off let me say it again is this message right they're having so much fun now that's reasoning and far as they know I'm free I've been set free no I'm I got Liberty now and don't realize reasoning got them thinking them that got them thinking that and they're in bundage they try to shoot this woman with a hypo shot to make her be quiet shoot her with a shot that shot didn't even do no good cuz it was too late she already seen when she was gone because that reasoning have left her that's why the prophet warned us and this day about reasoning it started in the beginning it's powerful and it's still here today so never reason against the word don't never let reasoning get you into a place when you got questions and somebody give you an answer and then you say did brother Brandon say that or did the bible say that see what reason is doing now saying come on is the Bible or this just brother brandom saying that let me tell you something whenever I preach or any preacher preach if we say the prophet said or we say brother brandom said what we simply said this is what God Said through his Prophet this is not brother Brandon's message this God's message he is the messenger God is God you can't separate a messenger from his message you can't separate it God with so much grace and mercy son of prophet in this age for you and me so we can see everything so we can live a life above this world that's what this message come to do take us into another kingdom another dimension that's what it comes to do but I know young people there struggles and things in this life but this is what reasoning don't want you to see reasoning don't want you to see and this time you get the Holy Ghost is a greater victory in my day did y'all know that for you to get the Holy Ghost in This Day is greater than my day because I did not have the struggles you got now I didn't have internet I didn't have this I had none of that but now the whole world has been set in front of your hand but what the greater power is God in your life yet everything can be set in your hand but you got something inside you you can deny it you can deny it that's greater how old are you brother Isaac 24 24 I'm not saying just to lift him up but that's a testimony how a young person can serve God that's an example amen I know a couple more young boys 20 young Brothers 20 preaching this message to show you can serve God in such a time as this but reasoning oh God I'll get saved one day I just I just need to express myself and release some things I want to do and my life see reasoning makes you think your life is yours but faith will take you back and tell you you've been bought with the [Applause] price are you with meall so young people when you even done wrong especially little kids when your parent ask you did you do something don't go crying ain't the answer they ask you a question see the crying is to throw your parents off I'm not one of the ones to be thrown off I let you cry when you finish crying I ask you the same question did you do it reasoning it teaches you to manipulate but yet it's trapping your soul it's a power don't play with it and it uses scripture I seen young boys God touch them young girls God touch them and their lives they really want to start off on the right track and then the devil just bring all kind of stuff in their life throw them off girl decides she want to serve the Lord a boy that she was like and never paid no attention to her then all of a sudden now she want to serve the Lord and he pops up and she ain't careful Lord you said it seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and I did it and you told me you were add to my life you told me that now you done brought him I see it in your word you done brought him I'm sorry he didn't God didn't bring it God didn't bring it the devil did to throw you off that's why when you start God start really dealing with you you see all stuff kind of start popping up what you need to do is start smiling Satan Satan Satan you don't think I can see you buddy you just not you think I'm that dumb what I don't been through with you you think I can't see you now no Satan I rebuke you right now I'm going on all the way going [Applause] all because you failed and been a failure that don't mean that's the end that don't mean it's the end but when you realize that you failed and been a failure that's our opening that means you can be helped cuz you now see your condition say wait a minute I don't have to stay down here I can come out of this because it's God's grace and mercy to even preach to you this way to let you know you can come back cuz he's a restoring God this is restoration the Bible said Ministry God has given us a Ministry of reconciliation to bring you back if you sitting here in that shake tonight God trying to bring you back amen can I say one more thing some of you probably don't heard me preach this but I I got to say it anyway it's about Rahab you can't get no lore in the life that Rahab lived it took a prophet to even explain why she was a prostitute we wouldn't never figured it out he said the parents put her out there for income I would have never figured that out but look at this woman even though she was put out there by her father and prostitution she still loved him she still loved him that's why she wouldn't got all her family come on get up under this toe CU she still loved them she's a harlot and then God going to put the Earthly lineage of Jesus Christ and a harlot from Rahab man from Rahab Simone comes Boaz from Boaz come Jesse from Jesse comes David from David comes Solomon on down and on down all the way up to Christ and he brought the lineage and put a a prostitute name there Rahab but you know when you look at the lineage of Christ you never see Beth Sheba name there it'll say that woman that's right because of the adulterous act God can't stand that but he used Rahab to let you and me know you can go down to the lowest and the lowest of life but still royalty can come out of it my goodness I love that story of Rahab think about it when the wall of Jericho went down here stands her cuz Joshua told his service go get her like you promised go get her here goes Rahab her and her family standing on the outside of Jericho I can see them what are we going to do now Jericho destroyed we we got no home what are we going to do now but she didn't know God had a plan see the mystery in rahab's life if she knew God was a delivering God she told the the spies we heard what y'all toing she said we heard what y'all done to this King done to this King she heard the mighty works of God there's no doubt she said if a God can subdue kingdoms all kingdoms what about this one let me have it if God can subdue kingdoms and they can be destroyed what could this God do for me what can this God do for me she looking at all of that all of the men's trembling she wasn't trembling she said I want this God and then the walls come down there go her and her family but she didn't realize God just didn't give her any man she gave him some on the captain of the Israelite Army from a harlot to marrying a captain of the Israelite Army did y'all y'all knew that but look at the story you're not going to tell me many women did not want Simone I know they wanted him cuz he's the captain but the Harlot got him the Harlot got him I can see aab now she got to come around Israel you know in the Bible when they go to the well that's why the woman at the well was there by herself with Jesus because of the life she lived she couldn't go around over the virgins drawing water she couldn't be there around them cuz they would look that like dirt I can just imagine all of the gossip when the war was over the Israelites what a victory what a victory but somebody say you know I heard that when the spies went over there they went into a harlot's house I heard that too girl I heard that to harlot's house out of all the places they could go went to harlot's house M you know Harlot that ain't good I can see some on just I'm just dramatizing to overhear that conversation did y did y'all say My boys that was a harlot house they went in they said yeah yeah Harlot Simone said you Ain happen to know her name would you I said I think it's Rahab he said right okay thank you I can see Simone wow what a woman she gave her life to protect my soldiers if that kind of woman can give her life for the gospel what kind of wife will she make me Harlot didn't even come in his mind cuz he didn't care about that he was looking at the character see when you willing to die for this gospel God always gives you something back oh my if RAB would have went to the wh she couldn't go where the sisters was there she couldn't they would have ran off she had to go when they leave you know that's true yeah sisters at the well dip in the water then RAB come and we see how God engineered that so perfectly cuz there had to be some kind of way for Simone and Rahab to meet had to be and God was in the all of that he was in all of it orchestrating it and then when he meet this Rahab I can see Simone finally meets her say I understand your name is Rahab and her reasoning kicks in yeah this man know about my life now he's going to tell me and my family we don't need to be around him we're too dirty then she said yeah I'm Rahab some on like wow you RAB sh that's me and I can just see someone can I ask you a question she said what is it will you marry me hallu RAB what did you say will you marry me she said but you don't know who I am he said I didn't ask you that she she said you don't know what I did he said I didn't even ask you that I just got a question will you marry me re said but you don't know my past he said but I know a future I know a future I can bring you to if you just say the magic word I do now can you see Rahab now walking with the captain of the Israelite Army and people had to respect her now here goes Rahab walking with her husband s sister's gossiping look at some on look at it you know what she did she did she did that and then RAB say honey uh excuse me a minute she he said what is she said I I want to talk to the sisters for a minute he said go ahead she go over there said sisters uh I heard y'all talking about me they no no no no she no no no no I heard you she said but I just want to ask y'all something everything that you're saying about me can you prove what I did they said why we heard she said I don't care what you heard can you prove what I did cuz when God destroyed Jericho he wiped her paths away that's the God we serve and the Bible said cursed is he that builds back Jericho when God forgive you for your sin curs it is he or try to bring that back up if you want to be free if you want to be set free from a reasoning demon you can be set free tonight God can take you back to your spiritual virginity God can restore your life all you need is say Lord I do I accept your wedding invitation I do you son the best man to the bride I say I do to your word now Lord have your way with me that's all you have to do friends cuz he said now I can give you a fewo [Applause] can we just
