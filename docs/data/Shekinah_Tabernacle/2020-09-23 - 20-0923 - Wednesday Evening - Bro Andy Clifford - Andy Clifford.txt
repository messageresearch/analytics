father upon the wheel a lord the the potter's wheel lord jesus that the potter's hand could just continue to mold us and shape us lord jesus that we may be found in the image that's in your mind not

we humble ourself before you in jesus christ's name and ask you just father bless those that couldn't make it tonight and those on the stream and lord and thus here lord in this place lord we just want to hear from you tonight in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah god bless you saints it is always a privilege and an honor amen to stand here it's always a battle when you leave here too so pray for me amen hallelujah but god is good he is faithful amen his word will never fail our words will fail but god's words will never fail amen amen who believes that tonight amen hallelujah i wonder who um who drunk that last is it safe mate there's a few of these little colds going around i don't feel like one of them right now you know it's a bit busy hey man hallelujah well are we because it's wednesday you know we will keep the entreaties short and we'll go straight into the word of god amen and so you can see up there on the screen um go tell go comma tell amen i like that it's not just go without a commerce go and tell amen hallelujah you know you've got something to tell amen amen we'll talk about that tonight let's turn in our bibles to um mark chapter 16 and we're going to read from verses 9 through to 20. you know they say that the you know theologians and men of manly wisdom say that that it's not inspired from the ninth verse on so i think if the devil tries to attack something there's something good there you know he put a scarecrow right there so let's see what the scarecrow was hiding amen hallelujah hey man it says here and from the ninth verse a now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country amen i like that in another form you see the lord appears in different forms and even today the same one is appearing in another form huh you understand you see it's not but just because you can't see him it doesn't mean it's not him or it's not anything less it's the same it's the same i might get ahead of myself amen afterwards it's not not easy to you know you just feel like you've got to go but afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they said it made and upbraided them with the unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen is there anybody in here that seen him after he was risen have you seen him amen no i'm not talking about with your physical eyes hey if he allows that when praise god but have you seen him after he's risen oh my oh man i love it god is good amen um and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word of signs following amen amen you may have your seats god bless you i want to repeat that 20th verse just for emphasis sorry it's very small it looked big on my computer screen and they went forth and preached everywhere something happened to these guys and they just had to do it you know there was something charging inside them they couldn't keep quiet they couldn't keep still amen there was just something going on burning hallelujah amen burning in their heart you know this was a very um this is a very uh challenging and powerful scripture here and preached everywhere the lord work this is the key here now the lord working with them see they went to the upper room and when they went to the upper room they did not come down until they met him this is the key to the whole story right we're right at the end now the the key to it is they went to the upper room as they were told and they never left there until something real happened and they met him too many times we go up for prayer to meet jesus and then we leave and we haven't met jesus you know this is true and it burdens my heart i see it at camps i see it at conventions people go up and they pray and they cry and then they walk back the same that's just what happened because people are just not perseverant but the brother brandon preacher is perseverant just be perseverant amen amen the lord is there to be me sometimes it's just a bit of a battle a wrestle with the angel of the lord just to wrestle off some unbelief or something that's hindering amen you know you break through in prayer prayer to break through the sound barrier and when brother branham says when you break through it's like you're not working yourself up into something it's him lifting you up into something it's not you working up this emotion until you get into some euphoria huh it's actually him it's you yielding the lord you know we think that's got to happen straight away it's all got to be fast right the lord doesn't it's not always fast sometimes it happens slowly sometimes it happens straight away man honestly you can just get down and it's like the law's waiting in your office and it's just like instantaneous fellowship and it's amazing and sometimes you've got to just knock on the door a little bit knock on the door until your hands knock through the door if you can just keep knocking and say lord i'm here lord jesus jesus preached and taught about the unjust judge type to show there is a tenacity that is required in many times for us who are stuck in this flesh that's full of unbelief in this human spirit that's so troubled and all these things going on and stuff that's there to hindu like israel they didn't just go over the jordan and all of a sudden jerusalem was theirs huh you see it wasn't just theirs instantly they had there was a fight a long fight but the lord was with them just like the apostles when they came and they came to the upper room and the holy ghost came down everyone wasn't converted all of a sudden they had to go out there they're to face devils they're to face the enemy on every front and the more that jesus worked with them the more they outreached the more the devil would come against them but the thing is they were operating in the purpose of god they were operating in the plan of god and god has a purpose see the lord is longing for his children he's longing to meet his bride he does not want to see people live and sin he doesn't want to see people taking drugs he doesn't want to see people drinking alcohol he doesn't want to see people fornicating he doesn't want to see these things happening in his bride's life and there's bride out there that it's happening there is elect seed that is out there and he doesn't want to see it his burden and there and that burden is the burden of the spirit that burden is the heart of god longing for his children longing to be united and he says go and tell he's calling us to be a witness you are a witness you are called to tell to go and tell you see the first one he came to was mary mary wasn't no special hi society member she was a woman that had seven devils she was a woman that was probably involved in the wrong things well i can say she was definitely involved in the wrong things you don't get seven devils for nothing so she was involved with the wrong things she was a woman that was of low caliber in society pushed down and she was the first one that was given the commission go and tell my disciples oh my god tell my disciples so right at the beget go we have no one that is exempt from the commission you're not exempt just because you feel insignificant or you don't have a ministry that you don't think you do but you do but you're not no one's exempt because of age no matter where we are in our life and our walk we are called to go and tell and you see when you start to operate in that channel in that capacity the lord will work with you and you will begin to see the miracles the signs and the wonders and all those things that are to follow the believer you see but there has to be an active measure on your your part to go and tell and the moment that you begin to say lord this is where it starts lord help me help me lord i don't know what to do you see it's not easy in this day and age of complete darkness and unbelief it's not easy there's not many left that would actually respond but yet we are called to go and tell and therefore it starts with an attitude of the heart lord i'm not a exuberant person that has courage to go and speak to strangers and things like that and therefore and i don't believe that the lord you know will call everybody to that sort of outreach style but yet god knows every name that is written in the lamb's book of life he knows every sheep that's going to come through at the great white throne judgment at the second resurrection he knows every foolish virgin he knows all of them that will come through eventually and will be in the bride he knows all of them so it will not hurt to go home tonight or even now even in the service pray lord jesus please lead me to your children lord lead me to your elected seed you know when we were early on in our church life here when we started praying that the lord just started bringing people hey it was amazing it just and we're called they're called divine appointments and they're people that he brings across your path and they might not be the actual ones to come in but they might know somebody they might let you meet somebody or arrange you to go to something and meet that person but the fact is you become engaged in divine appointments with the lord he gives you a schedule amen a schedule that you don't write down or know about but you just live your life and you you manage to stumble across a situation and you're faced with dialogue with somebody in some place and that person asks some question and then you give them a little tract or a book or you just it just comes out it just comes out you've got something special and i'll get to it later but we have something very very special we have uh the same message on my that mary magdalene had amen we have a risen savior telling us go and tell my disciples go and tell my bride that's stuck in the world go and tell her that i'm calling i'm longing for fellowship this is what we are in now this and i'll get to it i don't have a slide for this one because this one came when we were here acts 1 6 to 9 8 it says here when they therefore would come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me in both jerusalem and all judea and in samaria and now he's talking about you to the uttermost part of the earth amen to the uttermost part of the earth and i probably repeat myself every time but new zealand is pretty much as far away as you can get so here we are we're in the uttermost part of the earth and the same jesus who's commissioning us to go and tell to be a witness to to to to to tarry in jerusalem until you receive power when you get that power when you get the holy ghost there's a witness within you that burns in your heart oh i must oh lord where can i go who can i tell it's so glorious lord i want others to taste it oh my help us lord because you can also have the holy spirit and then get yourself over encumbered with things and burdened down with busyness i've been there amen but you see we don't want to div what's the word we don't want to spread our affections out too far just be careful you don't want to just have all these hobbies and all these things that are in your life because what happens is it thins out your potency you only have so much time we only got so much time to be a witness to live this life and it's pertinent to all of us that we just just get back and sit down and just say here i am lord and you basically let go of everything all of your plans and you and i and i don't mean just forget them all to completely but you just let it go and you say lord what is my purpose what is my what's my life for lord i've got all of these things that are kind of on the go but lord i'm willing to surrender anything for you you see the lord is gentle if you just ambitious and you you know and now you can if god's revealed to you you're calling and you can be ambitious for the lord and you're calling right that's fine you know it the lord is working through you he's he's working with you and you're out there you're doing it but maybe some of you don't know that and and so you're in a condition where you're waiting on the lord to be placed and you want to know what the purpose is for your life and and so there's a that you've got to just step back and say lord here i am lord lord what do you want from my life i'm willing to let anything of these things go if you just lead me and his spirit will lead you he will show you what your purpose is he will place you in his body amen so he says you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you amen romans 10 13 to 15 he says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him whom they have not believed this is the process now this is now paul is teaching them there is actually a process for people to come to the lord yes it's not just a haphazard thing unless god is calling a but but you you even paul the prophet messenger to the age god used a member of the body to bring him in you see he actually uses his body to bring forth children so there's a process but it's not the body that's funk that that's that's leading themselves it's actually the lord the spirit of the lord is works within us it works in the ranks of the body of christ who the lord is yearning for his people and so he uses a certain process within the body of christ to to call his people to bring to find those last lost souls and so here we read for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent so you see there is the line of order that god has to find there's there there it has to be the lord begins the whole thing the process begins by sending someone as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things amen so brother branham says this i don't know okay i'll put it after this maybe anyway i'll say this i'll read it out the main purpose that god is doing is to try to get you to believe his son christ jesus died and raised from the dead and is living among you tonight just the same as he was standing here visible like you see me or some of these other people you know this is what he he wants you to believe this is one of the core purposes of god is that he could get a people to believe that jesus christ what he did actually happened and that the person that rose up is here in this place to reveal himself to speak to you to change you he wants to come and sit next to you and he wants to talk to you he wants to speak to you tonight he wants to give you a word and season he wants to encourage you in some way shape or form he wants to commission you he wants to he wants to place you so the person that raised up from the dead is in this place tonight and he has a purpose and a plan for you if you just incline your heir as brother albert preached on incline your heir to the lord tonight amen amen you know brother andy will go right around and things and this and that but the lord will speak to you somewhere amen so incline your ear say lord speak to me i don't want to leave this place without my blessing i need to receive something and and you know this is i just say this off the off the note record but just say it's not easy to outreach right it's embarrassing i'm just going to be honest people will ridicule you that you'll feel embarrassed right and that's the devil putting fear on you that's fear embarrassment there's a fear of embarrassment right you start doing it i mean if you were just you were just known as the crazy preacher and in the town back in the day before there was big cities and corporate things and it was just a village you'd just be known in the city in the little town you're the crazy guy or or the preacher guy you know and never i know you you so there's no embarrassment anymore you're just exposed and revealed but the thing is now in your circles of friends they should know that that you're that one you're the oddball they know that they should know that and when they're in trouble who are they going to come to they're going to come to the oddball because something different about that oddball there's something different about that person and when they're in trouble they'll come there that's part of this witness that we're talking about amen but the reason i said that is it isn't easy this is not a flowery bed of ease to be a true witness of the lord you know and i believe that you know when we read the book of acts we see an extreme condition they lived in a very extreme condition on the pains of death to proclaim the name of jesus i believe we'll get back to that condition i believe society will turn like that again just before we go it'll be just like that i mean it's almost like that without them able to kill us you know in some places they do if you go to saudi arabia you preach you're going to die you know and if you get caught they think you're blaspheming islam and all those things and there's other places if you go down to probably times square in new york and while there's a pride parade going down there you probably get the hiding you know you'll get the beats or something will happen there'll be crazy demons coming on you through people trying to attack you and hit you and things so there is a persecution coming you see but did that stop them no there would something happen to these disciples it was so potent inside them that they went out there and they just went everywhere and some it's like you know we call it in the business world they got the ball rolling do you know that saying we're going to get the ball rolling it means that you're going to get the motion started the process some processes take time and so you've got to get the process beginning you know we use it in business a lot and so they got the ball rolling you know in the early church they just got the ball rolling the ball was rolling and they went out there and they just got persecuted and whatever they didn't care and all of a sudden they realized wow the lord's working with us everything we saw jesus do he's doing in us amen and you see are we willing to suffer the reproach for the cause of christ and that's exactly what will happen but the lord will work with you and you will see the glory of god amen you'll see him manifest himself to you amen amen he she that loveth me will keep my commandments go and tell right go and tell that's the commandment of the lord and i would say it's probably one of the more important commandments of the law because you see that's like the integral part of us going home i want to go home who wants to go home we're not going home until one last one's in you know so we're going to go tell zacchaeus might be up in the skyscraper sycamore in the city you gotta go find him you know now now you probably won't get there physically you know i don't think none of us might i mean i have ended up in a penthouse apartment like sweet before but you see but we don't always end up in those places but we might do and and there might be one up there but your prayer can get there i know you can pray into that place amen amen see the lord's eyes could see zacchaeus even though he was hiding amen his eyes can see the zacchaeuses of the 2020. he's got 20 20 vision to see up into the skyscrapers to see those executives that need to come down and be humbled and look up amen amen upon the man that humbled himself under the shortest man at the lowest part of the world zacchaeus amen that was a bit of a i don't know how that happened but amen amen um but what i was saying is just tonight say lord help me help me to have to find that place in my life where i can be a witness for you tonight lord give me boldness and strength so that i can be a witness for you amen children you're at school peer pressure's very strong and even amongst the children in the church you know you guys have got peer pressure as well and so you know to to be a witness it takes boldness it takes courage but the lord doesn't matter how old we are the lord can give us strength and courage amen to be a witness and it's so essential because i believe that there will be children your age in your age and that that will get converted amen because they've got to go on a rapture amen they're going to come and you know what will happen when when the rapture happens those little children will all of a sudden be 18 years old amen new children if it happens in the next couple of years you'll look down one day and you'll be you'll be your full size just instantly man isn't that amazing amen that's cool i mean you're anointed to that amen you're anointed to a rapture we're anointed to be raptured out of here one day amen the spirit of the lord let's go to so you know a church for that for the purpose of the church we see this tabernacle of the congregation and we see this is the tabernacle of a congregation and holy of holies the holy place and the outer court the holy of holies is where the the lord is and the heart but also that shekinah glory presence that can be accessed amen that where you receive the baptism of the holy spirit where you are converted where you're fellowshipping with god shut in in the secret place that is the absolute necessity for a born-again believer to come to and there's a process to get there but follow approach god in the way that's been provided now the devil's fought that way he's fought tooth and nail to block the path to the holy of holies by traditions creeds dogmas denominationalism fighting politics roman catholicism and everything that came out of it you know the the devil's fought and he's blocked it all off so that people can't get there but praise be to god he sent the spirit of elijah in the end time elijah rebuilt the altar so that a believer like us can fall on the altar and god's fire can come back in amen amen that's what the the purpose is now the approach to god this is the core we must now when we're out reaching there's no point in just teaching deep amazing things to people to to get their mind all worked up what's the point of that and i'm and it's very hard not to because if you're dealing with denominational people they want to argue with you in that level they want to debate with you about madness and profit that and all of these different preachers and teachers and what this one says and it's all babylon it's all confusion it's all the devil and i'll get to it in a minute i believe the lord gave me a little diagram just to explain it in its simplest term there's probably a lot more that goes on with it but the purpose for us to be an effective witness is that we share the approach to god we bring people to the lord jesus christ we teach the people what elijah spoke and talked to us how to approach god and you will see from 49 or whatever the first sermon all the way to 65 the last so many or he never left it he never left these core things he never went above it the seals opening and all the mysteries being revealed and everything it still contained bringing people to jesus christ amen all the other stuff is to give identity to the believer that's already met him to grow up in the statute to understand who they are to build up in rapturing faith but to witness to people and especially denominational people they have no approach correct approach to god some of them i can't this is one thing that we cannot as people put god in a box to say he cannot pull someone into this place without knowing who brother branham is i believe god can do that god can witness this god can reveal something to somebody just to at least get them to first base or you know get them out of the out of the world they can come in some way shape or form i don't believe it's very easy but there are people i believe that can get at least into this outer court they can get in there and they will come on for in the second resurrection because they've come so far but we're not going to deal with that subject today the important thing is how to testify how do we bring people to the lord jesus christ what is the approach who are we actually what is the message that we have because it's we have a message and i was telling people about it on sunday because it was just burning in my heart we have a message a real message amen the prophet's ministry he said this is my ministry to declare him that he is here he's risen again amen he's not shadowed down by all of these dogmas and creeds but the holy ghost was loosed again to be free to come and reveal himself in its fullness so the person of jesus christ is here and you and i have the the authority and also the commission to bring people to him that is your message your message is not a bunch of doctrines your message that you're telling people you've been given a simple easy biblical practical approach to god elijah's come in the end time to restore the altar and you can tell people how to get to that altar amen if they get to that altitude and it's all in the bible you don't need a quote book you don't need seven church ages you don't need that yet all you need to do is teach them the approach to god in the bible because guess what the prophet's quote book was the bible and everything in the message is in the bible everything in the message is in the bible and so if you don't use wisdom when you're witnessing to people and you just go straight on to prophets and preachers and teachers and all of this what you're doing is you're going to keep people in the religious realm of arguments and fighting and grey lukewarm church age that's where you'll fight the people and they will and this is where it becomes this is where this is this is really the core of tinnitus they will try the devil will anoint people to keep them out here arguing a few about a prophet whether he was a true prophet or not going on all these websites and this and that and everything and you've got to just go horon shush and stop i'm not talking about man i am not talking about prophets the lord will lead the election to the truth but you have to use wisdom in this fight and if you get caught up in a this man and this leader and this prophet said this and this one said that then they have prophets and everything in their own realms all sorts of balaams all sorts of great high name men that do massive miracles all over so it's not about that's the word you'll see in a minute now and i mean this stuff we already know right so i'm just giving you a refresher so where are we so we don't want to get caught up in the debates of all the religious realm see in this denominational religious realm as you can see they're not in here at all they're not in there the the re the only way to get in there is by the word of god by the waters of separation who knows the waters of separation so if there's no waters of separation no one can come into the tabernacle of the congregation no one can come in here and without the waters of separation no one the priesthood couldn't even come in here to do the religious and you can't have a waters of separation now without a red heifer that red cow and it's bright red oh not bright red but it's it's not cliff of the cow but it's actually it's like a reddish color but it's pure no blemish and they've been trying to get one for a long time and they they you know these guys man if you follow like and i don't follow them but if you did you know because um there is brethren that do um they're finding this red heifer you know and it's like has to be perfect and that stands for the word that is pure and the red is the blood standing for pure blood and a bleeding word that would preach from that blood a pure message and that pure message and that pure witness of the true approach to god to bring a person out of that realm and i believe that this realm is probably the hardest realm to work in because those religious people have got it all sown up and what they believe is close to their heart and the only thing you cannot argue them with all of these things and they've seen the miracles it's not about that but there is one thing or there's actually a few and i wouldn't say just one but the lord there is an approach there's an approach jesus christ has risen from the dead jesus christ has come out of the grave out of the tomb and he's the same yesterday today and forever this is the key stone to to to to begin is this the that jesus christ is the same and the same jesus that was revealed in the bible the same jesus that rose up is here in his full measure to work with you remember he's working with you and as you go out and you begin to tell these people about these things you will see if there's election there this is what you can't argue with it now they can try and there and there is a gospel guard and the gospel god has anyone heard of the gospel guards before so gospel god brother branham brings out the gospel guards are things that god's placed in the scripture to stop certain people from entering into things and believing things and and a gospel guard in the scripture was given in matthew 28 verse 19. now it's actually very simple and the lord was not being deceptive in any way but it's the way he said it he said go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost now people took that under constantine and the early roman church that began to compromise and walked away from the true altar of god and the lord said you're going to take my name out of the church and they took his name out of the church when they took the baptism in the name of jesus christ away what teaching would you find almost everywhere through the message that you must be baptized in the name of jesus christ and that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's saying that you must be identified with the death burial and resurrection of the living god that is in this room and his name is jesus christ his name is jesus hallelujah and he is looking for a bride to take his name and this is one of the keystones to a true witness to bring the people to the narrow straight way it may be seen so simple but if they can't take that there's no point in going much further you see you'll just get caught up in a bird flurry in this grey lukewarm neither light nor dark and it's not a good place to be but there is a zacchaeus there's a mary hey man they're out there they're out there they're undelivered they're out there crying out in their soul oh i just saw something real man they're sick of their churchianity this they're just always searching for something more who's been there who's been searching churches and realizing that it's just not really there hey this is it they're out there still they're out there and when god anoints and uses you to reveal to them the true name of god when they see that peter revealed the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost and just the words that you speak if god's in it and he's as we read in mark 16 20 working with you that says my words are spirit in their life then god's going to use your words to carry a spirit down into those people and reveal who he is christ the mystery of god revealed through your lips and they go poof that's his name all of a sudden they get a revelation of the godhead that's one of the most important things for somebody to go that that'll never leave them because when you recognize the eternal alpha and omega of jesus christ that he's not just some second person of a trinity amen that's imagination people worshiping an imagination praying to the father and then i better pray to the son a bit more and they're all like i just feel a bit strange doing this if there's election there because the seed can't accept that can it it's just unacceptable but then one day some unknowing person that fellowships in stokes valley just finds themselves in a little situation and then all of a sudden and they might you you'll find if you have a long-term relationship they know that you believe in a prophet they know that you believe that these have been a prophet but when you're witnessing to them don't let the devil take you onto that ground about all of those things because if they meet the lord if they truly meet the lord and surrender their lives and come through water baptism they will come out of that religious realm they'll come through the that says waters of separation see the waters of separation need to be at that gate for the believer that's believing the word that's being preached out here in these other realms i'll get to it in a minute but out here that someone's got to testify and send the gospel trumpet out the word of god how do we approach god how do we come to that altar it's in the name of jesus christ to be identified in the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ to come through the waters of separation god can use you to minister the waters of separation as a king and priest amen so just avail yourself to the lord and climb thine air unto him have a willing heart amen so now we have the denominational religious realm then we have the false religious realm which is all just everything else you see that they're getting further and further away then you have atheism in the world and then probably further down you just got demons and devils right now this is just this is just my own picture it's nothing it's just i just wanted to use that as a way to describe what i was talking about but you see now here these green things is us preaching it's us teaching it's us witnessing it's us being a testimony now we can i you know obviously i didn't want to spend too much time on this but these arrows are to go into every realm we're meant to be outreaching into all these different realms aren't we well you know we want to be a witness we don't just want to be a witness to denominational believers we don't just want to be a witness to fault people in idolatry you see and we don't just want to be a witness out in the scientific atheistic type of world of of of secularism you see we've got to be a witness in all of those realms and so there you see and i i truly believe that you know the the these different realms have different things that are hard and different things that are attributes about them you know you're going to come if you go into the false religion world you're going to come against witchcraft and witch doctors and all those sort of things and and they're going to come at you like that but you see the same spirits and the same demons that are coming at you of witch doctors are coming at you with theology they're coming at you with babylonian ideas and understandings and paganistic views of god and the atheists oh my my i was an atheist they just got an awful temper and an awful they just flare up but yet yet they've got seven reasons why they don't believe in god and we have the answer to all those reasons amen hallelujah these guys don't but we do because you see we have the waters of separation we've got the living god amen we've got the bleeding word the word the blood of jesus christ the one that speaks he says the new testament is in my blood that testament is in you and if you avail yourself to the lord and you come to talk to somebody and you've got you're you're right there god's spirit can speak through you he can speak through you and that person may be a seed zone but go and tell and then you're going to get people that come in from all these different sectors and i believe that this church is ready we're ready and ripe the embers are burning hot we're burning hot you see you know a fire when it gets to if you watch a fire you build a fire you get it so the base is real hot you know and all the embers are just burning and when you put a new wood on that fire it just eats it up that's good the new fire is it's a bit cool you know it takes a while but once that bed i believe we're there got a hotbed of embers amen and we just got to get some new wood and so let's ask god lord give us some new wood on the fire amen lord lead us to your elected seed amen lord give us divine appointments coming up amen lord lead us to your children he knows who they are he knows and he's in the business of leading people he's led people all the way from the beginning in fact he wrote the bible with people's lives and they didn't even realize it was happening you read ruth you read you you read those stories right who reads the stories and you find clear prophecies right through right that tell you who you are they didn't know that was happening there was no orchestration there was no like as isaac would know you know you got to write out all the lines and the scripts there was no script but yet there was script god predetermined all that would happen right these people just lived out and bible was written and you read that and you get glorified blessed and it shows you that you're part of the word and living in the land and you know who you are by ruth by esther by all these different lives and by david and by all of these things right and you see they didn't they just lived it out but god let them and god can lead you who's full of the holy ghost who's followed the spirit of god he can lead you to those elected seed amen now i i believe that the last race the last leg of this race needs to be more supernatural it must be more supernatural than going out there in the street on the soapbox and people giving their lives to the lord and the time of the harvest the great harvests the great outdoor preaching days of john wesley and and all those times where thousands were coming in huge amounts and it was indicated in the sky when the moons and all of that you know in the time of the seven church ages and and the lord indicated a great amount of light in those days compared to now where the lord gave no light so here we are and then brother branham i don't remember the details but he was able to put a little slither and you're that slither there's a few there's a few that have that are part of that little slither there and so it's going to take a prophetic vision of the lord in your own life lord help me lord lead me to your children lord father give me wisdom when i when i speak to them lord help me all of us maybe someone's sitting here tonight going man it's just not me i just don't have the courage to do it lay that fear down tonight it's only fear it's only fear and see fear cripples faith but tonight the lord can take that fear away amen you will not be rejected in heaven you may have a bitter rejection down here but what does it matter because where we're going eye has not seen or is there heard nor has it entered the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love them it goes beyond anything the prophet said it's beyond anything you could dream how good it is how wonderful heaven is amen so you see we need to bring people there so here we have this is this is this is what we need right here at the gate of the of the approach to god is a clear message that clear message is jesus christ has risen and he is the same yesterday today and forever and he's alive forevermore and he does the same things today as he did in the bible and this is how you approach him this is the biblical approach to god and they'll ask questions and you can share the history of how the name was taken out of the church if we all know that it's all common knowledge and they can go back in history you can have that all prepared if you like if you're sitting down with somebody else and i'm not just going to say this is always how you need a witness you need to be led of the spirit of god but here in lies the approach to god and when people see because they go they might go around to different churches and go but this pastors these churches baptize in the father son holy spirit but you're telling me and then you've got this is the thing you're not always going to win every battle some people are going to follow their creed don't just pack up your bags and think i'm never going to do this again because there's plenty of them that will do that you see the gospel i think jesus said the gospel of the kingdom is likened unto a man that cast the net into the sea right and you cast the net in and you drag out and you get gum boots crabs craze and all we like eating the craze but you get a whole bunch of different things but there is some rainbow trout there are some rainbow trout in that pool and you gotta just keep pulling you gotta cast out the net and you're gonna get some rainbow trout but you see the post-resurrection fishing see the disciples they decided to go out peter says i go fishing right and see it they didn't catch nothing until they heard from the lord and under a prophetic vision of the lord when i say prophetic vision you don't have to be a prophet but the lord can speak to you right and when the lord speaks and inspires something to you it's prophetic because he's giving something it's inspiration and profess prophecy is to be inspired as the prophet says it's a double meaning word it can either mean inspiration or it can mean to tell foretell something but if the lord inspires something to you what you're doing is you're actually acting in a prophetic vision or you're acting under a prophetic inspiration from the lord and he's just shown you something or you might have a dream and that in that dream you're going to meet somebody and you're going to go and carry out then all of a sudden you find yourself living out that dream right that's like under a prophetic vision so here you have the disciples fishing and they can't catch nothing and maybe you've fished for many years and caught nothing but then just incline your air to the lord and say lord lord i want to catch something lord where's the rainbow trout lord you see taught the prophet how to fish huh he thought the prophet had a fish who knows the vision 1956 what is the vision i think and also why are people so tossed about two sermons should listen to them very good and in there he speaks about how the lord taught him the angel of the lord taught him how to fish and he says when he saw the rainbow trout in the lake he says i can catch those and i was like thank you lord i got caught amen this is the clear message right here you've you've got to have a clear message and the devil will try and pull you from that clear message but the clear message is the altar to approach god if somebody can get if you can get somebody to surrender their lives according to the bible right according to the bible it says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and that person in faith believes that jesus christ the lord jesus christ died and was buried and raised up the third day and they want to be identified with him and they take water baptism in the name of jesus christ repenting and they call on the lord and say lord you promised me to that i would receive the holy ghost and and the lord is obligated to his word to give them the holy spirit and and that's then the lord said that the purpose of the holy ghost is to lead you and guide you into all truth and so this is how god's elect will come this is how god you this this is a filter right because you can try this on everybody and not everyone's going to come not everyone's you might get a wet a wet cynic dry center come up a wet center because they haven't repented or whatever and they're just doing it out of some religious motion you see but when somebody is sincere and the lord has called them and he's worked on their heart and and they come the provided way you see what's going to happen is the devil's going to lose the fight because now they're going to come in here and they're going to get up in here and they're going to get on that altar and some fire is going to come down one day amen and they're going to come into the church and they're going to start hearing preaching and they're going to things are going to start happening and that seed is going to be activated but if you get caught up in and and your clear message gets distracted and gets distorted by something and profit this and that and everything there's a time out on the fields when we're out over and preaching in different countries and they're they're from denomination you can't quote the prophet now i'm not against quoting the prophet because we're going to quote the prophet quite a bit in a minute but you can't you just can't do that you've got to quote the bible you've got to bring everything that you've been that's been revealed in the scriptures because it's the scripture it's the bible it's the truth it's jesus christ that's going to bring right that's the word this is what the prophet brought this is using wisdom once they come in once they get the holy ghost you know once they really start something starts to happen inside and they see this is real and the lord starts working they'll be led to the truth amen amen and now this is your clear message your clear message is actually the lord it's not a bunch of doctrines and teachings the clear message is a declaration that he is here many years ago when it was in its infancy a story comes to mind that the british was going to take the commonwealth of this nation and there had been a group of men that had assembled themselves together and was on duty watching and there was a horse stood hitched and a rider ready to mount at any minute first thing he got was a sign that the british was coming and he straddled his horse what good would it do him to spur his horse what good would it do him to beat the horse and try to make his way from that church to boston what good would it done him if he didn't have a message to tell the people how would they know to prepare themselves our modern paul reveres has run well but they're just running there's no message the hour is here the crisis is on a world is at the end churches has met their climax nations has met their climax human life has met its climax science has met its climates everything has run out time has run out all of these things are just completely stale the devil's kingdom failed the devil is going and leaving this world soon with his tail between his legs that's his figure of speech but meaning he's failed and he's going to go out with a big big tantrum and he's in that tantrum right now but remember you're on the winning team you're on the winning team we've organized science has met its climax we've organized and made big churches polished our preachers and physically set them together that they know how to use their verbs and adverbs and their sounds and and all their vowels and everything just right in psychology to contact the people but that wasn't what jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues if a deadly serpent would bite them that wouldn't harm them what is it they've gone and they've told they've gone and they've acted now i'm i'm encouraging you if you want mark 16 an action in your life go tell get out there go and tell your schoolmates go and tell somebody ask the lord give me someone to tell lord give me someone lord jesus to share this love and maybe you don't know that love tonight you can someone doesn't have the holy ghost tonight why don't you just surrender your life and get the holy ghost somebody here in this place just surrender your life could be your night to night if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover the world needs a messenger with a message to tell something and know where the message come from and who it come from hallelujah amen we don't just want to go to people with a whole bunch of knowledge and quotes and theology but we've got a message and this is a person and he's get there to back you up so then you can have courage that if you are to talk to somebody you know that the lord the person the message that you have that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's there to back up exactly and to come behind you and prove his word to his children we're going but with nothing to say it proves it now he's talking in general terms now to the church world so i'm not just meeting us as people here as individuals but this is a general where this is christianity without the holy ghost and substance this is a dangerous place to be but he says here we are going but with nothing to say it proves it when we come to a place that a nation or a people that denies jesus christ to be the son of god and stands in the face of our most challenging ministers of today and then in our great church league finding some 30 communists packing papers for 20 or 30 years that their members are that their members of the communist party and our united churches what can we do it shows they have run without a message selling out the very birthrights of the nation selling out the regular birthrights of the church and he says here it all has come to a showdown it has come to a place that the little church that's believed the message and stood on both feet with their eyes centered on the cross in their heart the resurrection of jesus christ burning amen is the resurrection burning tonight amen if the resurrection is not burning in your heart tonight let the lord set it on fire amen the lord is here to set it on fire the one that rose up out of the tomb is here the one that came to a prophet in 1960s is here hallelujah he's here to fan the flame john the baptist you see that elijah's elijah spirit he said the fan is in his hands he's come to thoroughly purge the floor maybe the floor in your life is a little bit blocked up or some husks or something and it's time tonight to let the lord fan it he's got the fan in his hand tonight he is here if i could just get one thing through and if you could just believe this by faith that the same one is here tonight he is here his fan is in his hand maybe there's a husk in your life tonight say lord here i am let it be fanned tonight lord i don't want nothing to hinder the fire hallelujah i want that fire burning bright you see the wise virgin amen trim their lamps and let me declare behold the bridegroom cometh go out and meet him amen didn't uh didn't uh martha declare to mary he's looking for you amen let me be martha tonight go the lord has called he's come he's calling for you he's out there in a secret place and he's calling for you he wants you to say lord here i am let the hust be removed fan me my heart lord jesus i want my lamp burning bright and clear oh lord take the carbon off i'm sick of it oh my you see this is exactly what we need if we could constantly labor for the lord if we could just constantly let this flesh be brought down low hallelujah amen hallelujah so yes it says here and this is the showdown right the showdown happens inside your own life as well as out there on the field and then you've got to stay dead reckon yourself as paul says in romans 6 reckon yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord amen what is he talking about being identified with the death burial and resurrection of the same jesus that is the same yesterday today and forever the very one that died and resurrected is here and he's saying i want you to be identified with me and he wants you to be a witness to go and tell that he's risen just as fresh as it was when mary magdalene was told just as fresh as when peter and john went to the tomb amen just as fresh the same one amen where are we it has come to a showdown has come to a place that the little church that's believed the message and stood on both feet with their eyes centered on the cross in their heart the resurrection of jesus christ burning it's come to a place where the nation has got to recognize it it's to a showdown no wonder that the churches when the council of churches it's so honeycombed with communistic no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they can't believe in divine healing they don't have any message in their heart oh my saints get the message in your heart hallelujah amen let it go from here and let it sink down only god can bring it from here down to here to take all that wonderful wonderful food you know like a you could say an eagle that's just caged up in their own ideas or just sit there and just hasn't broken through and it's just like brother brown says what's the use in having a canary bird that's got all the good food and all the oils and beautiful feathers and stuck in a cage and he says i just can't stand caging a bird you know a prophet that need had to soar in the heavenlies just couldn't stand it and he said but there's something far worse and that is a son or daughter of god that's stuck stuck and they're covered in good food and and good nutrition spiritual goodness and the outpouring of the spirit and messages that were stored up hallelujah and they're so healthy and yet not being used and yet out of not in full service amen because of some fear or something that's hindering the walk that could be so easily dealt with if we could just step back and say lord this is everything that's going on right now and i'm just going to take my hands off and say lord it's yours whatever you want lord whatever you have lord just lead me i'm neutral and then just start walking and say lord you lead me you know my heart the attitude it's not about physically doing nothing it's the attitude it's what is going on in the attitude this is what is all the focus the right mental attitude amen if the holy ghost comes into a man's heart he will believe that jesus christ is raised from the dead and he's alive in him to do and to do the will that he come to do the will the will of god through the man's life but the trouble we run we go without a message we go with theology amen we go with some kind of a church interpretation of the message he says scriptures but i'm going to say message for just this particular instance we go with an interpretation of the message but that's not going to get us anywhere but when you bring when the core is that people approach god in a biblical manner amen and give a clear message that the revelation of jesus christ he's unveiled he's arisen he's come amen in this end time to reveal himself in the full measure he's restored his church back this is the lord acting he's revealed himself the way he was before amen the way it was in the first church has been restored back again the lord promised these things and when you bring people through this in a simple way it blows them they go whoa it opens their eyes to see something that they were tunnel vision down here the devil's got people tunneled down onto this little track and they're walking this little track oh blessings and this little nice sermon at a church and a blessing here and this and that and they're all the way down here but really there's this whole thing and they don't even know they're just way down here in a little rut and there's all these little rivers of denominationalism and they're all just walking down there but there's this huge amazing thing but it comes with the right approach to god amen hallelujah amen all right it's getting a bit late now peter says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ and this is what i'm talking about but there were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory for they came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy amen where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arrives in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation you see as we sing god brings interpretation by bringing it to pass it's happening the interpretation of the scripture is the event thereof it's the unfolding of the will of god amen i'm going to skip some of this brother brown says we've got to go with the resurrection go tell my disciples that i'll organize a new church no no he didn't say that he said go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead hallelujah you know you if you might think that when i tell someone that that they've heard it before or that it sounds a bit outlandish for them but try it just try it my jesus is alive he's alive he's risen from the dead he truly has maybe god will anoint your words huh sorry i'm stealing your words brother maybe god will carry down on your words in that moment and change someone's life because you said something that you thought was too simple or too outlandish but just try it if we're hearing a word prophet say that we should do this i believe we should take heed and i'm i'm preaching to myself very much so right now because i think you know for many times but the law's really impressed upon my heart you know we need a witness but we need to have a clear message people need to know how to approach god this is what the devil's attacked do you think he couldn't wait to take the name of jesus out of the church he was so happy when that happened then he moved to take the bible out of the church too then he completely took everything out of the church that was true and it was dark it was just completely dark but god said i'll restore as he restored hello hello people that have entered in hello people that have met god how did you come in you went through the approach that elijah told you actually the bible told you that he just pointed you to the bible it was just all hidden away and when you found that approach that path you received the holy ghost so why not tell others if you're sitting here so happy and rejoicing what about those bride out there that are not rejoicing that are crying out for something real oh lord help me go and tell my bride that i've risen from the dead amen i mean you see that you get faced even the disciples didn't believe you know they thought my this is too much but the lord was gracious what did he do there was election there what did he do he worked with them he went behind mary and he said i'm gonna go and appear to these people and he went down and he he upgraded them he says oh look how come you're not believing he went all the way through the emmaus and told them and my see the lord will back up your words that's why i say now start with prayer amen i'm going to move really quick through these quotes i just i really have to get through a few quotes here that's the message to the church this morning that jesus is not dead he's alive and just as great just as great oh my just as powerful today as he ever was there's something in that revelation there's something about that when somebody can realize that and i've told it to hundreds hundreds and hundreds of people that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever that jesus christ the god of the bible i said and they might not have ever read a bible but most people know that there was a bible days right and i say the bible days are alive again the way that the new first church and if you're talking to religious realm then they do know a little bit half of them don't read the bible like we do like they don't even know the old testament stories or anything they just don't know that they're not they don't think to read it but when you say that we are the the that we have the book of acts that that we have felt worshipping according to the book of acts it does something yeah we're worshiping the same god and he's the same as he was and what you read in the bible that he did he he promised that we would do two and we do it it's the same jesus oh it says here there has been great messages but easter capped them all great messages easter was all of it when the dead was made preparation that last enemy we had seen sickness healed in the old testament we had seen miracles before in the old testament there were visions come in the old testament but every man went right to the grave wondering would he ever rise again but on easter morning when these disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get what did they get go tell my disciples go tell my disciples i am risen from the dead death has been conquered oh my it's something we can rejoice over death has been conquered death could not hold him there was enough anointing in that body in that life hallelujah that when he went down there the slimy hands of the devil couldn't hold him oh my the roman legion couldn't contain him amen there was an anointing amen hallelujah he says here there will never there never was nobody on earth no prophet no great man no sainted person could ever conquer they could conquer sickness by the spirit of god they could conquer time by the spirit of god they thought that was joshua and uh time of elijah i'm sorry uh azaya but they could conquer the time by the spirit of god and foresee things that was coming they could conquer that but never was there a man anointed with such an anointing from god that could make this statement i lay my life down and i'll take it up again oh this is the same god that's standing in the room tonight he's standing here for you tonight anyone that will call on his name for your need tonight don't leave here without the blessing of this one that said i can lay my life down and i will take it up again oh my he's our kinsman he's one of us and we're one of him oh my tear down this body i'll raise it on the third day there never was a man could make a statement like that and it was wondering in their hearts whether this would be true or not one time when they killed the prince of peace and put him in the grave and sealed up the tomb and death held him for three days and nights but on easter morning he had the scepter in his hand and hollered get away death get away grave open up i am the king's message i am the king's message i must come forth to prove this resurrection and i'm telling you now if you go in faith and you tell somebody the lord led you to he will prove his resurrection through the things that you testify amen this is an age at a time where god can lead you to his children god can lead you to people that need to hear the gospel that need to hear that jesus christ is alive that need to hear that he's risen need to hear that there's an anointed one a man here that could turn on the light that can change your life right now in a split second turn you from an unbeliever into a saint amen when they hear things like that people want love people want freedom people want life people want to have joy in their heart people want to live forever hallelujah i am the resurrection of life the strength of the lord is our consolation we have no other strength no other refuge have i none god have mercy take my life but never let me forget from whence cometh my strength it comes from the lord i don't want fine things of the world i want jesus i want his resurrection burning in my life oh i want that above all else nothing really matters unless i have that his resurrection burning in my life and as i said why not let him fan the flame why not let him fan the hust away why not let him blow on the carbon that's blocked out the light how different that was from jesus christ now he's talking in a comparison to napoleon see napoleon he conquered the world naturally and physically but he ended up a drunken wreck because he didn't play the game right the rules of the game of life were not played right because he forgot where his strength came from he forgot who was actually anointing him he should have given his life to god because it was god that prophesied that he would take that and conquer but he didn't play the game right but this one did our man our redeemer atkinson he played the game right as brother branham will say here how different that was from jesus christ at 33 at the age of 33 jesus owned everything he made the world and he was in the world and the world knew him not he never made himself no reputation he never gathered no military man he never organized any churches he never made any great names for himself he never come forth with any boasting degrees of doctrine theology and so forth never had a record of him ever going into any school of theology but he had god he had god and at the age of 33 he had conquered every devil that stuck his head out of hell amen hello devil conquerors whenever a devil sticks his head out of hell you are caused to cast him out you have authority to cast them down amen you young children you've got authority to cast down the devil and he will stick his head up what are you gonna do stomp him down kick him down amen amen hallelujah what's that song we sing where we he's under my feet amen that's where he belongs hallelujah if he's not under your feet he's out of his place at the age of 33 it conquered every devil that stuck his head out of hell he conquered sickness he conquered superstitions he conquered devils he conquered death and when he died at the cross he descended into the bottomless pits of hell and conquered hell hallelujah and on easter morning he conquered the grave why because he played the rules of the game right running with the message he was he was gone go god sent him and he had a message to tell them and with the message that god gave him he conquered the powers of satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave why he went he went he went he went go don't stay don't do nothing years ago and didn't brother ben preach on sunday i hear the sound of it going we're going amen so we need to go and tell tell the people we're about to leave hallelujah there's a rapture going to happen soon amen let's say this is stage two of your witness once they've come through stage one we're leaving don't tell them we're leaving straight away they might think you're real crazy then but you know when they really start to walk with the lord amen now you tell them like this is a going message we're not here to just stay around we're going to leave this earth amen just like jesus was anointed to take up his life again no man could say that but you are anointed to be raptured you're anointed to never taste death no man has ever been able to say that i am anointed to never taste death but you and me are anointed to be raptured out of this place amen do you believe that amen do you receive it in your heart i am anointed to never taste death i will be raptured out of here by the grace of my god hallelujah then before he died he said this even as the father sent me so send i you not to build men by military strength not to put all your time and who will be president that might be essential but it's not essential in this oh this world is gone we've got one message that is jesus christ raised from the dead he is the same yesterday today and forever what was the theme of the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and sometimes we just need to get down on our knees and say lord reveal that to me let that become real to me let me know that you're the same lord not just the same in your own self but the same in myself amen i want this to be personal i don't just want everyone else to rejoice i want to rejoice i want to have a good time too i want to laugh all the way to the bank as they say amen heaven is the bank i want to rejoice all the way there i don't want to be miserable all the way there we'll have our moments we need them we need our valleys but let's rejoice no matter where we are amen hallelujah we're nearly there and because the message is right because god sent the message because god sent the messenger no doubt that every gun of hell will be firing at him that's right he'll stumble and fall and get up and shake his head and go on that's the key it's not him that falls it's him gets back up and continues on and then upon this we got shake his head and go on we got a message nothing is going to stop it hallelujah upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it they can say what they want to do they can do what they want to the devil can rage and hell but jesus raised from the dead he lives today in us a few days ago talking to the great dr lamza who translated the bible from aramaic unto english and i seen that little sign god sign on there with the three little dots in it i said dr lamsa what is that he said it's god with three attributes and i said you mean god living in three offices such as father son and holy ghost he raised and looked at me tears come in that jew's eyes he said do you believe that brother branham and i said with all that's within my heart he throwed his arms around me and said i wondered when i seen there those great things going forth and the signs that you were doing i said that they told me you was a prophet i didn't believe it until now now i know you are he said that's it that's the message that's the thing that will shape the kingdom of god is the revelation of who jesus christ is amen lord help us to reveal who jesus christ is not just by what we say but by what we do our life is a revelation the wife is a revelation of the husband has anyone heard that before the wife is the husband revealed so the condition of the church is the revelation of jesus christ and so if that church is completely yielded to jesus christ and he's living in her then she will reveal him and in the natural the condition of the wife will reveal the condition of the husband in many aspects not in every case but in many aspects in a good healthy christian marriage the wife will be the revelation of the husband that could be very challenging or you could be rejoicing right now that's probably a touchy subject no no one's saying amen or nothing hey we're just very technically quite quiet right now do you believe that brother branham and he says yes and they this guy was rejoicing this thing will shake the kingdom of god this everything i'm reading is pretty much out of go tell so there's a reason why the prophet would bring these stories out he would bring out about the freedom from slavery he would bring out about all of these things that that that calvary that the resurrection would do that the atonement would do because this is what matters to bring a person into the kingdom is to unite them in the atonement atonement means at one minute with god that's where they made the word up that's an english made word to describe a hebrew word which i have no idea but it means at one minute so the we are in our core calling as ministers of reconciliation we are called to reconcile people to god we are called to bring people to the atonement and this is why in go tell the prophet centers around the revelation of who jesus christ is and that he's unchanging and that he's alive and that he's doing the same things but also the benefits of knowing that because when someone knows that that brings deliverance that brings freedom that takes the slave belt of sin of their life that gives them speaking terms with god and if you tell someone who doesn't know god and thinks he's some far out thing and you say i have i can impart you the blood of jesus christ to you and put you on speaking terms with god and there's an election in their heart don't you think that they're going to want to know more now i'm talking now these are examples you want to be led by the spirit you want god to inspire you you want god to be the you want these to be divine appointments but you see you've got to ask for them you need to be willing and if you're in a condition where you are asking you'll have an expectation and then that person that walks past you the ask question you're instant in season and out of season because you're in a mode it's a whole thought process change you see we're busy we're out there we're doing our thing we're just gunning it and we're this and that and everything else and then when you see then there's a need there but you just can't stop because you're too busy but if you're in that mode and you realize you know if i tithe my life right now that thing that i need to do will god will help just like when the prophet went to the woman aunt jemima she grounded a plane with her face maybe that person that you passed by grounded your car with her faith and maybe you just need to stop a little bit and say lord here i am lord let get in get come to a mode in your life with the lord where you can hear his voice again where you can hear that still small voice you see if the prophet was probably all stressed out too busy maybe the lord wouldn't he wouldn't have heard the voice of god saying walk that way and you see but he was tuned in he was tuned to the voice of god and this is where we need to be saints tuned to the voice of god hallelujah it starts with prayer help me lord let's just keep us really really simple and attainable it's his grace it's not our performance it's not our ability it's saying lord help me i actually want that i want that i i don't want to try and work myself into something or you know we get in a mode like because of the university in school we're going to earn that that certificate we've got to earn that masters and paul we've got to we're going to work hard for that thing oh my we're going to stress out jeremy if you're watching this we're gonna really study up hard but you see this is different this is lord i can't do it lord i need you lord jesus i can't be a good witness i'm afraid to go and talk to a stranger but lord will help me i need your help lord that's just being like a child this is just as come as a little child i believe the resurrection of jesus christ raised from the dead and he was the only man could say that all powers in heaven and earth is given unto me all powers into my hand all powers in heaven earth has given unto my hand go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature the gospel came not in word only but through the power and demonstrations of the holy ghost god help you to believe that god help me to believe that and we will see jesus someday that's that lumza thing that's the sign there i have no idea kind of what it really means but he says it's like the fire of god and here's the father son and holy spirit all in one attribute of god amen let's stand up the musicians please and we will i don't even want to look at the time we're not too bad [Laughter] amen is there anybody in here that wants to ask the lord to help them be a witness if there's somebody in here that just wants to have more courage let's think of this meeting because remember the heathen's raging out there and there's attacks on every front out there and the devil's right there trying to stop it would don't you think that if the devil can stop us from being a witness that he can just take a little bit more longer right this is his idea he wants to stop right as much as he can i mean unbelief cannot hinder the purpose of god but you see let's when the disciples first began right and they were having all sorts of troubles but then you know they got attacked by the councils and their sanhedrins and everything but you see the devil was trying to provoke them to fear he was trying to thwart them and they said if you don't even preach or teach in the name of jesus see because they raised that man the lame man at the temple they raised them out of the lame condition all his life and it got the devil raging so they were now in the upper room or wherever that room was amen and you see when they were in that room and they were they were they were threatened they called on the name of the lord together and the lord came down and shook the room and they said give us boldness lord to to go out there and preach your word and grant that mighty signs and wonders will be done in the name of your son jesus christ who knows the story right acts chapter four and so tonight um we'll sing a song and then we just pray i just want you to just pray and let's just believe the same god that shook that room the same god that gave him boldness can give us boldness because you see let's not think of this as just another sermon but let's think of this as a commission this is a commission to do the final last part of the mission you are called in the final move in the final voice to the final age and this is the last stand before we go and i don't know how many years or days it might be but you see there needs to be a witness in the face of death in the face of fear in the face of humiliation in the face of persecution there must be a witness and hello you are it i'm it we are it and therefore we need boldness amen we need to be in a condition where when we're busy we can still hear the voice of god and be willing to stop and and and minister like the good samaritan amen let us pray um do you want to play a song is there anyone that thinks of a song that's kind of related isaac you're normally good at this a have you got a song bro yeah let's do go uh yep go tell john we'll do go tell john but let's just just play it and we'll just pray lord jesus father lord we are just needing lord jesus father you to take these words and this commission lord that you spoke i'm just resounding lord what you've already said lord what your prophet elijah spoke in this generation lord and and that's momentous sermon go and tell for father you knew lord the pressures that we would face in society and in our own lives in the personal way lord we all want to be accepted we all want to be liked and we want to be loved and whatever group that we find ourselves in whether it's secular spiritual blood family social professional whatever groups we find ourselves in lord we want to be accepted but lord to be a witness father it does come at as cost lord and the cost is to suffer the reproach for the cause of christ and lord jesus father i pray that we would feel and experience the crying of the spirit in our heart lord that we could feel and experience the burden of the holy ghost and how you are dying to be reunited how you died and rose again to be reunited how lord your flesh was ripped apart and to symbolize the veil being rent the veil of the badger skin being ripped down from top to bottom just like it was when it hung between heaven and earth the veil of your flesh was ripped from top to bottom until you were unrecognizable lord if that's the cost lord hanging naked on a cross unrecognizable bones showing from the torture and the blood and the thorn crown brow and yet you looked through those bloody eyelids that were probably not even intact lord and the nose that was probably broken over and spit hanging down your face you looked with compassion down and you said father forgive them for you they know not what they do lord and and father lord you turned to the left and you saw that faith hanging on your right o lord jesus and you looked with compassion and you said today you shall be with me in paradise lord you were never too busy lord jesus to reach out to that lost soul to that one lord jesus that needed healing touch of jesus christ and father tonight lord i pray that lord we would follow suit i pray lord that you would grant that you would give us boldness tonight lord boldness father and courage i pray lord jesus lord that you would lead us to your elected seed father that you would put your words in our mouth and give us a revelation of what i believe you put on my heart to express tonight and i believe lord it's very difficult for me to express in words the revelation and the burden of my heart that you placed in their lord about the clear message lord but father lord it doesn't matter how good my words are lord it matters lord that your word was preached lord and i pray that you would take your word not my word but your word lord and anchor it in every heart of ours lord that lord be in the magnitude of it lord lord jesus father the burden of the spirit we would experience lord that we would have a compassion for the lost hallelujah lord that you would father lord wave your fan over us tonight lord to wave off all the husks and anything lord that's not of you lord to reveal only the golden grain that's ripening in the sunlight for we know lord that the grain is gold lord it was green father 50 old years ago lord but we were told by a prophet lord that we needed to lay in the sun a little bit and lord it's been 60 nearly years lord jesus of ripening oh i see the golden grains glistening in the sunlight tonight lord but father lord jesus there's still a few husks about in our own lives that just need a little fanning tonight and i ask lord jesus in the name of jesus christ that you would send the wind of the holy spirit to blow out those husts of fear and unsurety and lord unbelief and doubt and lord may lord you reveal the more sure word of prophecy that we have received that we may declare that you are alive and well and just as great and just as powerful just the same as you were and are because you are the i am hallelujah oh god i pray father take these words and anchor them in every heart give us physical strength lord father for staying here a bit longer on the wind say lord we do just thank you and ask for grace in the name of jesus christ lord we call on your name and ask lord for a holy boldness like you gave in the acts chapter 4 to those that lord were facing the heathen facing the unbelievers facing all those realms of religion and false religion and atheism and all those things but father lord the gospel trumpet had to sound and i pray lord for an anointing to come upon each one of us lord that lord you would give us father that prophetic vision that we just spoke about earlier inspiration dreams and the gifts of the holy spirit lord to find those last ones to find the zacchaeuses and to find those ones that are entrenched in the denomination oh lord that lord you would help us to just rely on you to speak and bring people through to the atonement lord that they may be led by your spirit into all truth and come out of those grey world and into life in jesus christ's name i thank you lord and commit these things to you and i thank you lord we humble ourselves under your mighty hand now in jesus christ's name amen [Music] amen let's sing that song what song is it playing is it go tell john let's go a bit faster it you or do we look for another [Music] has [Music] jesus sent them with a man that's a message this is what he said go tell the captives they have all been grounded liberty go tell john when my prophet speaks believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and i'll interpret it by

place that the embers that have developed in the church would find use in blessing the new souls that come in for father the dynamic of new believers and new converts is an essential part of the church and of the atmosphere and of the purpose of life in the name of jesus father let us go with your benediction lord remembering lord father you chose me hallelujah and lord you carried us from
