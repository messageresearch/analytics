there's a bit of a heightened sort of spiritual climate it's it's a bit of a human thing you know when our mind gets on other things then we on on more natural things then we kind of slip into that mode but when our mind's been on spiritual things our spiritual temperature is a bit higher but let's keep what we gained you know we we we don't want Camp experiences just to be a bit of a it's always a refreshing but just a bit of a high and then we just sort of slip back down we want to keep keep what we gained you know we want to we want to keep make an effort to keep in in a good atmosphere all the time around us and um I believe that's the the um place that we're coming into is we we are we're going to keep ground that we gain you know and speaking of that we have some testimony we have a testimony time too if you'd like to share anything um any testimonies from the camp it's always nice to hear different ones experiences that they went through it Camp what what the Lord did you know we sometimes just get caught up in our little thing that we did there and we're unaware of other things that happen so it's always enjoyable for me to hear them as well so let's um let's stand this morning and we just open up in prayer and ask the Lord to be with us Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord that we can um just be in this place Lord that we've set aside for you Lord

of God to move amongst us we're under great expectation Lord to hear your word Lord and to to that you would speak to our hearts this morning Lord May our heart be open to your word Lord we know it's your word that sets us free Lord so we just pray that you'd bless um this the ministry this morning bless brother Ben Lord may may he step aside and let you speak through him this morning Lord and may we receive it as being from you Lord that we could get everything out of the service that you would have for us may we not look at it carnally Lord and just think we're just being spoken to by another man Lord but may we may we look at the supernatural this morning Lord and know that the supernatural God is here Lord that you could speak to us Lord and that we'd be reverent and and our hearts would

you can take your seats this morning we have the first uh item and testimony from Sister ping Shalom s i I just have a ever testimony um the thur day uh before the the camp um we were in low heart normally Amma has got some keyboard lesson um in low heart Thursdays we were driving towards that and at the same time we also needed to go to Queens gate uh to get some few things um and um on our way there uh I think we had just turned on the roundabout in hot Road and there was a black car driving in front of me it was just a moment of looking at arm and before I know it there is this car in front of me that has stopped I trust I tried the best possible way um to stop the car and there was just no way out turning I was still going to hit him either side and the only thing that was left was to hit him the funny thing for me was that I think I was I wasn't doing anything about 50 km per hour but somehow the airbags were popped um the car is not that badly damaged I think the only thing that was affected was the radiator even the leak what was just like a drop um so the person that I hit um left the scene so I really don't know what happened and I would like to believe that he didn't just stop for the sake of stopping clearly there must have been something that he saw or that made him to stop but anyway it happened and I was taken um called some people and the support was enormous there were other three brothers on the road who helped me out but I just want to thank the Lord because it could have been worse Amma God head I think her wrist was affected um and I think the impact as well of the airbag on her chest but we can only thank the Lord so um if the devil had his way we wouldn't have made it to to the camp I called brother kuben it wasn't planned and he's like you are coming to the camp I've got a small car to borrow to you so I am just so grateful that we we made it to to the camp because it was such a blessing and um today again it's our one year anniversary here in New Zealand and um we have just seen so much love um from each and every one of you um I have never felt alone my kids have never felt alone because we have you here and I just wanted to to thank the Lord for each and every one of you I know I don't say it often to each and one of you to say thank you but I just pray that God will bless you and give you all your heart's desires that is just my testimony and the camp it was our first as well um it was lit uh it was a blessing one thing that I know is that we can never lose it doesn't matter what happens we cannot just lose and just thinking of that makes me realize how small we are and how great God is because we make all these mistakes because I blamed myself somehow for the incident but at the same time I'm like but I can't take any fault all the faults all the mistakes everything that we do we just cannot take accountability of it and that's just the nice thing that God has done for us he's just taking the blame for everything that we are doing and hence I'm saying we can never lose in any way so I've got a song that I'm going to sing um in English it says in the hollow of his hands but please bear with me I am going to do it in my um native language in suu but it's in the Hollow of his [Music] hand oh feel [Music] L one [Music] into [Music] larest Soul God [Music] l [Music] nowy girl all [Music] in the of his hand in the whole of his hand I am saved whatever may be tied me I am saved whatever may be tied me in the whole of his [Music] hand praise the Lord amen does anyone have a testimony or anything they would like to share if you do you um can come up here and hold us God bless you Saints hello oh um um man it was a marvelous Camp thank you so much everyone knows who did did all the laboring behind the scenes and in front of the scenes the Lord knows and it's blew me away actually and Naomi and I were flying around her house spiritually for a quite a while after and I know some other people in in uh talaki are also do still up around the ceiling somewhere so praise the Lord thank you so much um just a tiny testimony something at camp that was very special and really helped me a lot I'm not um particularly good at getting up early and um but at Camp I seem to be able to I think it's just the amazing anointing that's there or something and anyway um so I was able to get up early the the morning mornings I was there and after getting ready I wanted to go and have a cup of tea and um but you know I think as we go on further with the Lord we're always trying to find his will and what we do and even the little things and I can understand why brother brandom got very nervous because it might actually sometimes it affects me and I get a bit nervous I'm doing the right thing is this where the Lord wants me to go is this who the Lord wants me to talk to and all that kind of thing and we can get overly concerned and we can get too tense about it instead of relaxing a bit I'm speaking for myself so after um I was heading from where we were sleeping towards the dining hall and you know there's that ramp from outside that goes up and I was walking along thinking is this what you want me to do Lord and then a brother a few quite a few years back had written a song that goes why don't you walk a while with me I don't know if any of you know that song it was brother Bob M and um there was I just that the words of that song just came to me like that and I had this Choice cup of tea or um walk down and across the bridge and it was a bit of a battle because I'm a social person and I like to talk to people and that it wasn't just the cup of tea it was the attraction of fellowshipping and that but I thought okay just made the right decision so I thought put the Lord first so as I didn't go up that ramp but you know the the pool is there and then you walk down towards the toilets and then it like that well there was two welcome swallows up on the little wire thing thing and they both just as I walk started to walk down there swept down and went by me now I don't know whether they do that to other people or normally but for me personally that was like the Lord saying welcome it was just to me it was like oh I'm in the Lord's will I'm doing the right thing and then to walk down and I don't think I've done it before now I haven't at Camp haven't taken the time to walk down there with that um that Bridges and the jetty that the children fish off before that bridge there was no one else there and the lake was just so calm and peaceful and beautiful and I thought man I nearly missed all this you know and the busyness of Camp not that I'm to much but um you know you can get caught up in the social side of things I can't um to walk a while with the Lord and it was just so peaceful and I just was able to spend a bit of time with him down there I just thank the Lord for those those little times he gives us when we listen to his voice you know praise the Lord amen oh can be next God bless you everybody uh just a quick testimony so the few weeks before Camp I'm sure we all love it battle's very intense I mean I don't know about you but I love getting chisled by God it's very fun um and I was in the ring with Satan as we all are and I'm always a winner even if I'm not winning in my circumstances I still know I am a winner so so I was in The Ring Of Satan and then I sat down in the corner for a drink of water I was just like getting a little bit tired all right let's uh watch a sermon and Andy had preached a sermon here I don't know might have been a week or two or three before Camp I can't remember when and he just said don't wait till Camp till you to get to a 10 already be at a 10 and then and then go to Camp I was like Ah that's pretty good he was like don't don't be at mine five and and get to camp and get to zero something like that I was like oh yeah that's good so that just just Greatful to the Lord for letting Andy say that to give me the strength for another few days I didn't get up to 10 but I got above minus five so that was good [Applause] yeah Oh short thanks um I know I'm really new here Collins my name and uh so there's only the second service but I got to go to Camp which was really marvelous um and uh I've been quite um hungry for what God's got more of and uh just at the beginning of the year um I met a guy his name's Tim Spurgeon I met him up in tang and uh I'd only met him twice and then had no more to do with him and all of a sudden comes a text from him um and uh it's um just gone um where's it gone anyway it's the text that has a scripture in it and he just felt that it was for me and uh out of the blue and it's behold I'll do a new thing and I'll make roads in the desert and all that one and uh I look he it's just disappeared off here but um yeah so this is the new road and uh and uh I'm I'm really excited yeah so um the previous church I've been at um I've been there 15 years so so it's a definitely a new road yeah and so I'm looking forward for everything God's got for [Applause] me Isaiah 43: 19 behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert amen praise the Lord anyone else supposed to say something but that scripture just inspired something out to me because I remember when I arrived at Camp I think was among the last people to come to camp but when I arrived to Camp I arrived around 11 12 Monday morning and I battle with the idea of coming to Camp not because I don't want to come but because work issues a story one other day but I've learned to get to a point where I tell God like I I just thank God for the because there some ones were so for me and they were like um it doesn't doesn't matter what the devil brings I get to a point where I tell God what do you have me to do because at this point I cannot control anything anymore so just have your way whatever you just just just put in me the will to just keep walking and no matter how hard it gets just let me keep as long as you're with me that's all that matters so I did not show up at Camp of course all those days but I streamed all of them as loud as possible at work I didn't care how many guests are coming in I'm at the reception like this and I'm just putting my phone there loud and and guests are just walking by and they're just like moving and I think they're just thinking this girl is nuts but yeah I'm not for the Lord I really did not care I was just listening they were so good I was just like Hallelujah this is so sweet and then on Sunday night I I came from home going to my for my shifts feeling quite unwell but I did not know what God was planning because already I've just told him you know just have your way and I really got sick and then I get I had a one guest who was remaining cuz I knew I was coming to come but I was like I wish I can get there earlier God has his own way he works in mysterious ways want us perform but I I normally my shift ends at 11 I left work at 10: because I was literally sick I was a bit Lego I don't know if anyone knows with Lego and I did not know it was attacking me at that time but I was feeling really nauseated I'm not the type to vomit so you just feel vomit coming up and it's not coming out and it just feel really hot and nauseous and all those kind of very bad stuff I went out get some fresh and it was just really bad but at 10 Shar I I had finished everything locked up and I mean in my head I'm like I need to go home but I'm like I'm going to come and I went and I reached C it's it's just interesting how God made me sick to leave work early to get to C so for me that's that was God's work so when I get sick as long as he's with me that's okay if I'm fine as long as he's with me so at the end of the day I just God that he works in mysterious ways it doesn't matter whether we're in a dark very darkest Hall we're still there with him and I like the song because I'm still it in the hollow of his hands so it does not matter where it is in our eyes it's it seems really rugged and bad and everything but we are still in the H of his hands yeah so yeah amen praise the Lord amen uh so from a sound perspective just to give you a bit of background that Hall is atrocious you know if it if you ever had a challenge on trying to get a sound come out of a speaker not bounce Against the Wall come back at people and and hurting their ears that's the hall you don't want to be in but we we've got this Hall and the Lord has said this is where you'll have your camps and we go we we need to deal with it testimony and glory to God is pride is a a very awful thing and it gets you into a place where you count on your own ability and if anybody comes and say hey I would like to to give you a hand you get full of Pride and and you just push them away no matter how big the situation no no how matter how little the task somebody says I want to come and help you say yes say yes pride is even in if infancy you say um and there's a couple of examples in the camp but I won't I may be use it in a sermon one day but where people will come and say can I give you a hand and you go n now I'm fine that's Pride address it right there because even if you're fine people come and help cuz God send them to come and help and you're just too busy to listen to God so what's the same with me and um everybody and Brother Joseph if you're looking this is all for you and me I I want a brother to Christ because now we get Teran Church to come and help and which is pretty much they are family and and um Joseph says can I can I help with a camp and I go talk to Ed I did because we we we work with a system we fight with a system we we already have all those challenges to have another wheel on the wagon goes oh yeah I don't need that but wait I needed it I didn't know so we get to camp and poor Ed he has to babysit me and and Joseph on the Thursday we just at it you know the whole Thursday we're just fighting cuz we want the sound to work but Joseph has a gift that the Lord has placed with him and it is come to eqs and how to to do all the speakers and the right setting so that the sound will come out clearer CU we don't want that Distortion and I know how to pull a cable and plug it into the thing and that's pretty much where it end so I needed him but because pride is there it was always that push because every time he'll come with a suggestion I'll kick back you're like you know why you changing this and you need to give me the that and and halfway through the Thursday I kind of realized I I can't do it this is actually bigger than me because the whole point of Camp is let God be glorified not man so so my motive there was wrong to begin with so I had to go and sit down at a stage and go Lord I'll just serve same same as what you said walking around to the river I'll just obey saying as sister ping you know I'll just go I'll just go wherever Lord just send me I just want to be in your in your will so so whatever is going to happen now next I need to surrender to my pride little thing but massive so I said okay Joseph this is a deal if you change something just tell me what you changed and tell me the why so I can kind understand why we doing it cuz there's no point changing it and I can't fix it afterwards but it's not fixing it he fixed it but then he started showing me how it works and I started going to it and said okay bro well then if you know all these these technical things why don't you do that side of it and I'll just be volume control and damage control cuz when anything goes down I'll just make that happen he goes sweet and we made a good deal and we said okay this is how we're going to do this camp and the sound of Camp was awesome and it was a challenge because when brother Bley was losing his voice that's the hardest time where you have no voice in the microphone to try and put it through a speaker it's very hard but we got through it and we still had camp and afterwards I said to to Brother Joseph it was the most interesting Camp because all along I thought I was right but all along I was wrong I said because my motive was wrong though we all serving God you want to serve him out of your ability and that's not what God wants so my testimony brother Isaac is sometimes most of the time to be less is to be more in the kingdom of God Amen so all glory to God for humbling me and thank you brother [Applause] Joseph God bless you Saints I just thought something quick to share um we were at camp and there was a there was anointed word or inspired word to me that just hit hit somewhere so deep in my soul and heart that I went and shook the um preacher's hand the young lad I forgotten his name um and he was saying how we'll fight for certain things and he said we'll fight for our young Youth and previously I had been um I don't know if it was it was something I listened to and it was saying how we're not going to give the devil our increase and we're not going to give the devil our joy or anything and they say we're not going to give the devil our youth or our younger generation and it just hit so deep and he like yes we are going to fight for our younger generation in our church and I just wanted to tell you that amen God bless you all I really didn't want to come up because I don't really know what to say but I had to so um I've just I was delivered from something a while ago but the devil didn't let me accept that and I just the whole Camp was a mind battle and a lot of guilt and it was just the actual confidence and the sermons were such a blessing but just told me no it's done and it was actually just the accepting of that which was so hard like that was the biggest thing but it was just done you know and I just thank the Lord for that because it's just changed a lot for me so thank you [Applause] Lord God bless you the devil is a loser and I'm the winner and you are the winner my one is there's a scripture in the Bible that says resist the devil and he shall flee and full stop doesn't go further than that resist the devil and he shall flee I always said to myself the opposite is also true if you don't resist it resist him he will accumulate what came out strongly for me at the camp was when brother biley spoke about maturity and growth and I realized that uh there was a professor who said an old Professor who who was way long in the field of academic and research and he wrote in a book and he said after 40 years of being a professor and uh thinking that i' I Know It All I've now come to realize that up to today I'm still learning so brothers and sisters until we go home we none of us will ever get enough of God so I thank the Lord that he has brought the issue uh the aspect of growing and maturity uh you know through the sermons and I really appreciate those brothers who came to preach for us God bless you God bless you everyone um just a quick one I'm just really grateful that I was able to come to Camp um and grateful for everyone's prayers everywhere I went um on the first few days people that I met were saying that they were praying for me so I'm just so grateful to the family of God for that um and that I could be there no hello everyone I just want to say I'm so glad to be home I'm very I'm very unhappy I missed camp but I um I just want to thank the Lord for all we had 14 flights and I'm not really that happy about flying and I just feel like in six weeks God really looked after me and brought me home safely and I missed you all so God bless [Applause] you God bless you all um just wanted to uh kind of like overview about six testimonies because we were so privileged and blessed to have the youth all youth got in contact wanted to come up on Friday night and just spend time together and share testimonies and um Andy and I were blessed enough to be there and just hear the heart of our youth and I'm really really thankful to each and every one of you um we know like in our whole Fellowship but also just to see the youth how they've had a real touch from the Lord and each one sharing from their heart just so humble and thankful for what the Lord's doing and sharing about the fire that's been rekindled or lit and um just seeing no glory go to the devil whatsoever and just seeing all glory go to God and how they're just humble and thankful and just excited to see what's going to happen from here on and one testimony someone shared with me that always stuck with me and when I kept hearing all the youth testimony one thing that um just stayed there and kept coming back to my mind it is more Supernatural than it [Applause] appears someone's thinking should I go up shall I not I go up shall I not praise the Lord it was a um it was a very Supernatural camp for me um the way that I would describe it is um they I always wanted the first song to be one of them it was just I don't know why I couldn't get away from that song it's it's not it's just quite a normal song and nothing it's a nice song but it's just a song but I just felt that's going to be the opening song of the camp I had all the other songs moved around moved around but that one just stayed there and then when it was the ending song at the camp the the brother I think it was brother Isaac he said oh let's sing one of them at the end to me that kind of encapsulated what the camp was like it was just a supernatural experience that that God was just in control from the the beginning to the end and and so that that was yeah it was an outstanding time for me let's um stand this morning we'll just sing one song as brother Ben comes blessed be the Lord God [Music] Almighty Father in Heaven how we love [Music] we lift your name in all the Earth may your kingdom be established in our Praises as your people declare your Mighty work blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come blessed be the Lord God Almighty who reigns [Music] forever father of mercy be exalted may Jesus name be lifted [Music] high for the

praise the Lord let's um oh yep it's here let's um just go to the scriptures this morning we're going to go to uh Acts chapter 3 going to kind of uh tie a few things together this may seem a bit yeah I guess we'll come come there eventually but we're going to go acts 3:17 and then we're going to go to uh we're going to go to Genesis chapter um 41 amen like to yeah I would like to welcome sister K home where's she gone is she still there amen it's great to have her home great to have Michael here you had the shortest uh what do you call it job interview in the world Amen at camp and here you

the the reality of Jesus Christ amen so let's just read this here and now Brethren I want that though ignorance you did it as did also your fathers this is Peter speaking to the uh uh Jews and so on but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of All His prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began amen and we're just going to go to Genesis um uh 41 and we're going to read from verses 39- 45 I trust this all ties together um yeah we just yeah amen says here so this is where where Joseph is exalted to the right hand of pharaoh uh here in Egypt it says and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God has showed thee all this there is none so uh there is none so discreet and wise as Thou Art Thou shalt be over my house and according unto Thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou and pharoh said unto Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and he raid him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh's um called Joseph's name zephan panea and he gave to him uh to wife uh asth the daughter of poera priest of on and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt amen so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's pray gracious father we want to thank you dear God that we can truly sing from our hearts blessed be the Lord God Almighty Lord we're so thankful we can Praise You In spirit and in truth today and we just want to ask Lord as we are here father in the service that you would take control Lord once again that Lord that this uh this this service would leave human control and you would take Lord take control anoint me Lord take over oh God and not just anoint the speaker but anoint the hearer father may you grant it Lord may you do what you want to do do in this service father For Your Glory we commit Our Lives into your hands we ask your blood would cover us Lord and may you have preeminence Lord we love love you so much and thank you for all you did at Camp Lord we're so thankful you're not just at camp but you said you never leave us nor forsake us so may you continue to lead us on by Your Word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning so I want to take um I want to speak about uh Joseph's wife because we're living in this day and I'm probably going to jump around but sorry my throat hasn't recovered from all the praising and shouting and things you know you know but you know we live in a time of we live in the times of refreshing we live in a time when God is pouring out his Spirit more and more now all this I'm going to tell you is not you know nothing new but I just want to I want to just encourage you that you know your position that's right am mean if you know who you are the devil didn't put you there the devil can't take you out amen so if you just stand in your god-given position your god-given rights amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ remember the devil didn't put you there he can't take you out amen God called you and he placed you in a position and God wants you in that position and if God wants you as the bride of Christ you're going to be there amen amen you've got to but we have to surrender our Humanity to God's call I mean we've got to give our lives over that that that God's Vision becomes our vision and then it become manifested amen because there's so many voices in this world that try and give us a double mind I mean try and make us forget who we are and what God has already made us amen we got to realize that we are the bride of Christ am mean we are join ears with him amen We Are Made In His Image we're called by his name washed in his blood am mean that that that our identity should not be in our natural family right our our identity should be in Jesus Christ the word right that should be the defining piece of our identity sure we have our nationalities we have our you know we have our you know Humanity but that shouldn't Define us right because brother Braham came to a place in his life where he realized that he wasn't just the son and of Charles and Al Brandon but he was a Son of God and when he came to that that gave a stability in his life that he wasn't tossed to and fro by humanity and people's opinions and you know popularity trying to fit in all these things CU he realized that he was a Son of God and when he realized he was a Son of God it gave him a stability in his life no matter who was pulling pushing proding whatever he could stand there on God's word and realize I am a Son of God I mean I am not just a brandom amen I am a Son of God I'm called by his names this is where I'm trying to go along these lines right because we you know we live in a day where where where God we are living in this time of refreshing I mean you see when the rain comes Jew falls on the ground it's a refreshing for nature maybe it's been a dry summer or a dry day but when that rain comes in the evening I mean it refreshes the plants maybe the leaves begin to whip when the rain comes out it refreshes and they open back up again and you know they begin to grow and Bloom and you know we're living in that day I me we're not living in a dry day I me we're not living in a cold day we're not you even though the devil wants it to be dry he wants it to be cold he wants us to be indifferent but God wants us to be soaked amen he wants us to be saturated by his presence that's what God wants amen so if God wants it I say Amen Lord remember because he wants to he wants to reveal himself more than we want him to reveal himself to us right he wants to live in our lives more than we want him to live in our lives and I'm sure we can say we want him to live oh yes 24 hours a day 7even days a week when you're on holiday whenever on the job you want him to live amen School wherever you are you want him to live right so but he wants to live more than you want him to live amen so I'm so thankful God's that way but see see so we're living in this time of refreshing where you know that has come from the presence of the Lord amen this refreshing didn't come from a building amen hasn't come from a Bible School hasn't come from a church building hasn't come from a campground it's come from the presence of the Lord amen so God is pouring out his Spirit more and more because he's getting us ready amen he's preparing our Hearts he's changing our lives amen this is not human Reformation this is God's transforming power to align us with his word amen to change our thinking our moods everything we are to be balanced in the word of God Amen so so there is this time of refreshing now during this time of refreshing as it says here and he shall send Jesus Christ whom before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things so so Jesus Will so we're physically going to meet him in the air amen that's what Believers believe amen the Rapture culminates with the believer's bodies change we our bodies have changed but we'll physically meet our Lord in the air we'll physically meet the one who hung on Calvary in the air we'll see him face to face there amen he's preparing us for that time amen and if God has called you by his word he's quickened his word to you you've received the Holy Ghost you're in raptured condition amen already amen you're sure you'll have struggles you'll have the things overcome you'll have battles but you've got to real I can't remember who said it but we have the victory amen amen we're in the we're in the palm of his hands amen we are we are there safe and secure we have the victory because we have the Overcomer in Us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right sure we have trouble but the Overcomer is greater than that trouble amen so so we are looking for the physical return of our Lord Jesus Christ we are looking for the physical resurrection of the Dead in Christ we're looking for the change of these bodies right this is what Believers believe amen so there has to he will stay there in heaven I put it that way until the times of restitution or restoration of all things now notice there's multiple times of restitution so there's a restoration of the Bride right the church started in the book of Acts amen God moved and Power dwelt in his church but that wasn't a harvest amen that that was going to be taken it was actually that happened that the church would eventually planted it would die but come forth in a Reformation amen through the church ages but now we've come to a time where the bride has been restored back to the book of Acts amen we there's a New Testament Church rising up amen and we've risen up amen you got to realize you've risen up amen if God has quickened you from death to life you've risen up but then now the rest of our Walkers God unveils who we are according to him amen that's the thing that matters it's not what the devil says you are or what you say you are it's what God says you are that's the thing that's stands amen that's the thing that matters it's not my opinion about me that matters my opinion changes and and sadly it's mainly negative about me right but you know but it's God's opinion you know when I begin to read Lord what do you say about me Lord hallelujah what do you say about me Lord you're worthy amen you're made in my image you're washed in my blood see the thing is the devil you know the devil's got this mind battle who said you have the right to claim God's given promises who said you have the right to say you're clean who says you have the right I mean to say you're washing the blood that you're an overcomer who said he says that because he's trying to push you back down under his control am me we can say Satan the Covenant I have with God you're not in the picture you're not in the picture you're just the accuser of the Brethren you do your job I'll do my job I'll stand on your head am mean I'll be victorious if I let God do his job in my life amen this is this is how we you know we need to look we honestly we need to feed on what God has told us about ourselves this is an age of identity crisis where people forget who they are this is why there's you know depression and you know suicide all these troubles come into the has come into the human race because people don't know who they are right and and that identity can move like the wind but if we realize that God has given us our true identity I mean this is why the message came to give us our true identity in Christ that we would realize that we are the children of the most high God am amen I'm just going to plug away amen I just pray that the devil would just be you know we're going to realize that sure the devil fights us but God is greater than the enemy he's greater than all our problems amen he's greater he is our Lord is the solution to every problem that we have amen and so during this time of refreshing there will be a restoration of all things so so people will go that's why brother ad when he preached the opening of the seals he says I no longer call you church but I call you bride that you'll understand amen that you will understand your position in the word amen that we are not just a church amen but we are the bride of Christ now a church is like a bunch of servants like we heard over the weekend there's difference between sons and servants right a servant is like the devil amen he you know you know he's a fired servant you know angels are servants they're not the royal family amen they're not made in the image of God Amen they are not his offspring none of his dnf and put it that way is in his uh in the Angels they are servants they are made to be servants but then the devil because of Pride Rose above his job description and he got fired that's what happened but he got real upset about it he says I'm going to I'm going to take over the company but God says you can't take over my company you can't take over amen so so he so he's a fired servant so he's lost his authority that he once had as an archangel in heaven but you got to realize that the blood of Jesus Christ puts us back into a position of authority amen because remember God made Man In His Image and Adam and Eve had total dominion over the Earth right they they had they could they could just speak a word they had total Dominion right but they fell from that position amen but God said I will restore amen I'm going to restore I'm going to restore man back to the original position that's why Jesus when he when he came he was the second Adam amen and he showed he had dominion over nature he had dominion over death he had dominion over everything that could be named and he didn't just in this realm but he went down to Hell to show I have Domin over hell death in the grave amen Satan and all of us ho so that was the first I mean that was the second Adam Jesus Christ now we know there has to be a second Eve right we're going back to a man and a woman in a garden amen but God is making such a way that we can never leave the garden Hallelujah the devil because the devil will be no more but he'll make us in such a way that we cannot fall right and it's the same thing with a redeemed son or daughter of God if you're sealed into the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure you may have a lot of trouble you'll have mind battles you'll have struggles but you can never ever go back to being dead in darkness and sin and unbelief ever again because you are sealed in amen you're not you're not just put in you're sealed in amen if God has sealed you and the devil can't unbreak the seal amen cuz sure we can grieve the Holy Ghost we can do all those things but that that does not mean you've lost your salvation just like David when he you know when he when he got to a spot in his life where he thought he doesn't need to go fight anymore he's just going to sit in the palace and enjoy everything and kind well brother said he backslid you know then he looked at bashra and all that chaos happened in in the kingdom and he wrote that Psalm restore unto me the joy of my salvation and the prophet said look he didn't say restore my salvation no he said restore the joy of it amen so so he never lost his salvation we lost the joy of his salvation so we can lose the joy but doesn't mean we lose our Salvation amen so the thing is right God can seal us into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost we can never fall like Adam and Eve did right because we've gone from Death to life right they went from life to death but they had nothing that could come at that time to take them back to life again right so our souls have gone back from unbelief to Faith amen you can say our souls are in the same are in the same condition as Adam and Eve were before the fall right sure these bodies going to be changed but our souls that's why we may have battles in our mind doesn't mean we're not a Believer doesn't mean we're not an overcomer we may have sickness that doesn't change nothing about us being Overcomers right because our but the devil can't he can't attack our souls those are secure I mean as long as in our souls we say Amen to every word there's something that says this word is true I may be wrong but this word is always right amen I say Amen to every word there's something in you saying it not consciously subconsciously you agree to the word what's that you've changed from Death to life amen that goes beyond all Sensations manifestations it's got to come down to something conrete which is something in The Believer says Amen to every word hallelujah so so we have you know so we are standing so as Jesus was the second Adam we are the bride of Christ as the second Eve amen so so now remember Jesus said all power in heaven Earth is given unto me now now where did he put that power he placed it in his church amen that he would come down into his church or his bride and manifest that power and authority amen so that's why the blood of Jesus Christ we got to realize we safe and secure amen amen if you're under the blood you're safe amen there's nothing see the devil would come and try and harm you but you would have realize actually no I'm secure you have a right to withstand the enemy you got a right to cast him out you've got a right to deny him and turn him down and you know expose him for who he is you have a right by the blood of Jesus Christ amen to stand in God's given privileges that the Lord has given you amen so Lord so now as we're reading there in in um Joseph's life now we know Joseph was a perfect type of Christ he was spiritual amen he was hated of his Brethren because they were jealous his father gave him a coat of many colors amen a covenant coat rainbow coat amen just as our lord Jesus is a covenant given to him amen of you know of life you know the Jewish his Jewish Brothers should have loved him but they hat him because they were jealous even pilate realized the reason the Jews had had Jesus crucified because of Envy they were jealous of him you think about here's this you know you know the generations of of of of a family have been studying the Torah studying the Bible trying to but they can't make one promise come to pass they can't make one thing move am mean they're still controlled by the Romans you know the you they're just looking at prophecy debating and slicing words and just looking at meanings and things but here comes a Man Out of Here Comes A Man from Nazareth he does he didn't come out of any of the lineages amen but he just spoke a word he didn't debate the devil he just said go amen he had he had total total control he spoke things amen that that that even Jesus said the prophets wanted to hear these things you hear yes you know and they were jealous of him yeah because the people the people loved him you know when Jesus said you know you scribes and Pharisees you know you lawyers you know you Heap burdens upon people and and those things you won't even touch with your finger when the people heard that they said they would have said that's true they would have realized man these guys don't love us They Don't Care About Us they just want to exercise lordship over us and control us but here come but this man but this man's a different kind of a man amen he wants us to be free he wants us to know God he doesn't want us separation he wants to reveal the father to us amen he wants us to know the truth of the word amen and that's why they loved him but they were jealous so they crucified him amen so so Joseph's brothers were were jealous of him you see so he was sold for you know um however many pieces of silver just like Judas sold sold Jesus you went down to Egypt you know then he was then he was there in prison there were two two prisoners with him you know the Butler and the Baker and hopefully I don't get this wrong but the baker died and the butler got restored I think that's how it was the two thieves were hanging on the cross with Jesus one went to Paradise one was lost you know and then and then after Jesus rose you know he's at the right hand of the you authority of you of the Majesty on high just like Joseph was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh amen but now now there's an in between stage because when this happens in this when this happens he gets a gentile bride amen he get because remember every Christ type in the scripture marries a gentile Moses married a gentile amen Solomon of Judah married Rahab a gentile Boaz married Ruth a gentile amen so there's many Gentiles through the scripture amen speaking of speaking of us isn't it amazing when you can look at the Shadow and something and you says that's you something in you says that's you it's not you trying to find a place it's like the chief director come comes along says this is your role amen this is your role he say I'm not prepared he says don't worry I'll prepare you for the role because I see equality within you that you don't even see necessarily amen you know many times we think lord well I think it quite often some Lord why did you even save me this guy you know let's be honest sometimes you even wrestle with God's gra Lord why did you give me you know your grace why am I beneficiary of your blood and it it's simply just is because I chose you y goes beyond this thing it goes into a c Gene of election in here amen but you see now Jo Joseph married a gentile bride now there she was she was a she was a daughter of a priest so she came out of a place of idolatry we all had our Idols oh yeah someone asked me on the phone other think it was yesterday what's an idol I said well it's anything that you worship above the word of God as an idol anything it can be it could be your job yourself it can be your it can be your hobbies it can be you know your family it can be anything can even be your church people can worship we're not here to worship this building or a name well the only name we here to worship is the Lord Jesus Christ but you see you know but anything that gets in the between you and God's word is an idol and then and then even people splice and cut the word to make an idol that's right that's what the Egyptians did they took the attributes of God made it a God they split God up we can't split God up he's one the whole word I want I want the cover also you know I believe it from cover to cover and the cover also amen I'll take it all amen it says holy Bible amen the word's holy hallelujah praise the Lord amen so she came out of a she came out of a um a long line of idolatry but you see she was predestinated to a different position God didn't want her to to be an idol wor worshiper though that's how she is raised but you know we know that when a when a when a woman marries a man that she takes on his identity that her her old identity is gone amen her old name is gone there's a name change goes on signifying a change of life there's a change you know there was a time when my wife was a r now she's a glowing glory amen you know and you know yeah so that's just how it is praise God there was one time time I was United to Satan by first Birth by that first nature I was called by his name because I was doing his acts it says in you know Ephesians chapter 2 that we all walked according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience right it doesn't say disobedient children children disobedient anyway that's another thing but you know so so I was United to him by that first nature so I was called by his name and I his life was lived out of me amen but then one day God came and interrupted that Union amen he interrupted that Union that that first nature just wasn't put away in a closet somewhere to be a plan B if things go funny if things go hard no that guy died am me that's why you got to come to a real repentance where where there's a death to self amen like the prodical son brother Bley was talking to me about it you know when the prodical son returned back to his father he said I've sinned against God and you many people just say oh I've done you wrong no he he acknowledged his sins were affecting God first and then affecting the father you see and that's a real repentance amen but you know you aren't you glad that day where that first guy died that first nature there a cruel Master made you do things you didn't want to do dragging you around causing you trouble amen but then that nature died so you United to another prise the Lord hallelujah amen that that you know that now you become amen Mrs Jesus Christ amen that's why it's so important we're baptized in his name amen we are baptized in his name because we are called by his name and we we're showing this world in the Unseen World we are now identified with the word of God we're not identified with culture or Creed or denomination we are identified with the word of God that's why we take on the name of the word which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now now now this um um asath amen she went from being the daughter of Piper the priest of an to becoming m is Zapf pan now this is significant amen because now the now now there's different meanings to this name but you know this is this is one meaning I found God speaks and he lives amen so now now Joseph was called this because they saw that living in him because remember when when Joseph came before Pharaoh God was going to speak and they knew as conduct in the prison they knew that now it wasn't just an idol of stone and wood and different things the egyp Egyptians had but God put on flesh and God actually you could say in a way walked into Pharaoh's Court just like he did in Moses a few hundred years after this but but but here was and and then so they they identified the spirit of God was in this man was in Joseph so they so so his name was changed Amen to zapan which one of the meanings is revealer of Secrets which is all true as well but God speaks and he lives I mean so now now Mrs Zapf panea took on this name I mean so now she begin to manifest because we manifest the life of our husband talking am mean we so we manifest the life of our husband right so if you're if you're United to Christ you'll manifest the word amen if you're not you won't amen so we want to be United with him amen so now so now here she is she was worshiping dead Idols sure they would have had a lot of music and ceremony and all these things in their in their temples but but but God God revealed himself to her to show this is me I'm alive I'm here to fulfill the word I'm here to fulfill prophecy amen and so that so so she begin to Manifest this that God speaks and he lives now we are in the same boat amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ I could say hello Mr ZF P how you doing today amen why because because your testimony is God speaks and he lives not just that he has spoken but there's a living voice upon the Earth that he not just lived but lives amen that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he's not just a historical God or a future God but he's a present God Amen and this is to me what was so powerful about Camp God spoke and he lives amen he oh man it was just so just I thought just masterpieces of sermons The Devil just getting so exposed at every every angle amen and you know and you just just such an encouraging you know encouraging word and things so I'm just trying to back in behind that you know come in behind that the we realize that you know we are called by a different name we have a high and holy calling amen and if God has placed you in that calling that's your calling amen just like her she was once a priest's um daughter but now she's United to Joseph her life changed you know and maybe maybe because those things were familiar maybe there was mind battles I don't know maybe people would say remember you were that PR you know remember your dad potterer and what you used to do in the temple with him and you'd say yeah used to I'm not that I'm not that woman anymore I'm not that person anymore I've been I've been United to Joseph and his God Lives amen and because you know we are one amen so my identity is not in what I used to be it's in what I am now Hallelujah by Christ amen Lord hallelujah so God speaks and he lives now we know we are the body of Christ amen we are the body Body of Christ I I I just I just pray that the Lord would just you know remember the scripture says I don't have it that we would know as we are knowing right so we'd come to a place where we know as God knows us right now there may be a lot of you know a lot of things that you know about yourself that have to be done away with okay that's what the word does Amen reveals our true identity beauti and we and God wants us to walk in that identity amen he wants us to embody that identity amen because it's not just a tag it's a life amen so now so this speaking of Our Lord who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him are all things created that are in heaven they are in Earth visible invisible where they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers all things are created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body by the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that is in all things he might have the preeminence uh for for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen so so we are the body and he is the head amen and we're going to realize that who has ever seen no no one has ever seen a headless body that lives and has fun talking about a human okay there has to be the so the head has to be there to have life right so we're here so so we are not a headless body we're not here just trying to work out how to walk with God in our own ability no we have the headship of Christ amen we have his word we have his anointing amen that when we can that we can turn to him for leadership amen we can not our feelings not what we think is all going on but we can turn to him for leadership and God can guide us through cuz this is a very foggy day right but it's also a very bright day amen so sure there's fog but there's brightness as well of the of the coming of the Lord amen so we can walk in confidence I believe that we this is just me I feel that we're more confident in our walk with God than we were 10 years ago who feels that way sure you've gone through a lot of things you've had a lot of trouble but you know but God's brought you through right he's given you overcoming power right he has he has stabilized your life Hallelujah what's he doing he's revealing to you who you really are amen because you no longer think the way you used to amen you think differently God's been honing your thinking and ways why cuz he's showing no this is who you really are that guy is not who you are this is who you really are but he shows it in your life I'm glad how God does it hallelujah amen amen glory amen it would say in Ephesians that the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ amen so we take on his name we take on his identity amen we take on his life hallelujah amen now the Lord we are I mean we the bride of Christ around the world is the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ amen we're anointed amen we're not here here trying to drum up something and just some enthusiasm amen our life is not enthusiasm only we should be enthusiastic hey I'm going to Heavens that makes me happy you know but but we're not just living on enthusiasm because enthusiasm comes to an end amen all human motion comes to an end but Revelation cannot end am mean Revelation does not have an expiry date amen so if it's been revealed to you am mean that he is your Lord he's your lord and savior that can't come to an end how can you deny him if he's revealed himself to you amen amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah so so there is an anointed bride body upon the Earth just like the your asath became Mrs Zapf pan amen where she she was called by his name and she began to express that name because they are one husband and wife are one amen so now so so where the head is the body must be also that's right amen so where the head is the body must be also so we're going to realize that we are never out of his presence am amen he said I never leave thee nor forsake thee just just just you know you know he said never leave us nor forsake us if we don't feel it that doesn't mean he's not there we don't have to have a nighttime service at Camp to realize he's with us a mean we can feel as dead as a post but that's feelings feelings come feelings go but the peace of God you all know okay so we can we can stand on the fact that God has called us by his word and if he's called us he's going to keep us in that position amen remember this is the hour where God calls his bride through a word remember this message is not a church call it's not a foolish virgin call it is a bridegroom call Brother Ram says the bridegroom call will come right through this word and gather his elect amen so so just as just as Joseph was given amen his wife so the bride has been prepared for her bridegroom amen praise God I'm glad we're not just fumbling around on sometimes we feel like we're fumbling around but God God is directing our steps God is directing our steps he's even through hardship and trial you know many times God ain't you know God loves us with an unfailing love right he is not a god waiting to to to kick us when we're down he's not waiting for us to fail and then show us you know make us feel bad cuz we fail no he wants to reveal himself in the fall amen because it's not him that fall him that gets back up that's an overcomer right so sure we fall and fail but as long as we get back up amen we've overcome amen cuz why we have proven that that thing that made us fall is not going to keep us on the ground see the devil wants to pin us to the mat in the ring amen but no we may be knocked out but we're getting back up hallelujah amen just get back up on your feet doesn't matter what it is say Lord your blood is more than enough Hallelujah Lord forgive me one more time try me one more time lord I want to walk with you hallelujah amen that's why we can we can such I don't know I just have such confidence that if we just surrender to the word of God like never before God will prove that word like never before I mean if we just because remember if you have see if we see if the devil can put a shadow on the word saying are you sure it will work then your confidence will go upon yourself yeah because you're not sure if you can really TR yeah sure you can kind of trust a bit but he says how do you know it's going to work we've seen it just just go back in your old just go back in your life he said if you repent of a baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive for the for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost who's seen that who's seen that in your own life okay so that promise is true but the devil will say well what about this promise how do you know it's true well the same God gave one promise gave the second promise he gave the third promise he gave the fourth promise he gave all the promises right so if he can vindicate One Promise in your life he can vindicate prodical coming home he can he can vindicate your family coming in amen he can vindicate healing whatever whatever the promise is God is more than able to do it if he did that one even you think about it we were once his enemy but yet he loved us so we our will was actually against him once upon a time but yet God still turned you around and Vindicated Vindicated his word in your life in spite of you am me so how much more now are people that their hearts are for God Amen maybe once upon a time you know as and a thought that Joseph was a crazy man I don't know who's this guy in jail maybe heard some rumors and stuff about him you know so her will wouldn't have been United with his will but then when they came together and were United amen they wouldn't had conflicting Wills anymore her will his will became her will amen so now how much more you and I see the most Supernatural thing you'll ever see is a soul converted yeah and it can such a simple thing where Once Upon a Time like brother R said about sister Bruce you go look at the message where where where where she's there multiple times it's not just a private interview that she's there but she comes to the altar she prays for people all the way through the message and she comes down to the end of the prophet's Ministry and she has this private interview I need to know I believe the Lord will show you brother Bram where I got the Holy Ghost if I do or not and then he just asked a simple question once upon a time you were going that way and didn't care about God but then now something happened and now all you care about is serving him and living for him what did that and she says Christ he says there it is that's it see what is your what is your motive in your life is it to see him live is it to see that others would know him is it that he would live or not you that when God does anything in your life you're not included in the picture you're not even in the testimony because it's God's testimony right you just want to live live for him you read his word say Lord change me to match your word Lord I believe that's the heart of the Bride amen that all we care about is Lord change my nature and all that I am hallah that that that that your heart becomes flesh in me your desires your motives your objectives your word becomes flesh in me there's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me you know that's a supernatural desire who put that there God put that in you you didn't put that in there God put that in you why but what's happened cuz I believe because a Union's taking place and then you can look back and see you can see God's hand that's why Mark 16 and action is the true church these signs shall follow them that believe so you walk and you see signs following not leading following what's leading you has still Small Voice cuz my sheep know my voice is stranger they not follow amen so you see God's voice leading you and then you see signs following you well how often do I need to see them to vindicate you know that signs follow me no God will take care of that it's not you that does the supernatural by the way it's him right you just be yielded to a spirit be lead and God will do those things amen praise the a lord now if we go to if we go to um so I'm just now we're just going to read this and maybe I'm going to yeah well I'm about to close I'll do a brother Kyra so now and there was war in heaven Michael and his Angel fought against the dragon this is one of my favorite scriptures this is one of my favorite scriptures because it shows the devil lost the beginning and he loses at the end but then also I into the picture too cuz they overcame him who's are they that's you isn't it amazing before you born God saw you cuz remember hallelujah hallelujah see prophecy when God speaks it it can be a sentence but God knows the people he knows the conditions he knows when they're born everything that all the details of their life for that person that goes into that prophecy just like how you know God told Abraham you know your seed's going to be in Egypt 400 years I'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand and that prophet phy was Moses and that prophecy was a pharaoh that didn't that didn't know Joseph and that prophecy was the boys being thrown into the Nile and that prophecy was Israel becoming slaves it was all in there and the and that prophecy was the 10 plagues in Egypt and that prophecy was the Red Sea and that prophecy was the task Masters drowning in the Red Sea I mean in that prophecy was the blood being applied it was all in there Hallelujah so many times we think it's just a condensed I don't know how many seconds to read a verse but you're in there yes Hallelujah you're in there amen so isn't it neat that you know in the beginning let's just yeah you if you ever feel bad just you feel down just read this this will make you happy amen there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven he lost he lost okay and he's a creature of habit he loses he's a deceiver you know it takes the Holy Ghost to outsmart him but he loses okay amen and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser our Brethren is cast down which accused him before our God day and night and they overcame him yeah here I am here you are amen inter stage left you okay they overcame and by the blood of the lamb and by by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death amen so this is how we overcome by the blood of the Lamb that we're not we don't overcome by our own ability we overcome by the power of his blood me by the perfect sacrifice I think brother Isaac Hatfield preached he said the perfect blood perfectly loose the people am amen but the devil says are you sure it does oh yeah well you're not here anymore you're way over there somewhere you know you've been loose for my life you don't control me see there's a big difference between the devil controlling and just trying to influence right we got to always differentiate because the the devil trying he he he hates to lose a soul right because all he wants is to take a one son or daughter of God to hell and he's one but God can't lose one of his so the devil always try and and and and influence your mind your thinking right remember but you can't stop the thoughts coming but you can stop how they affect you right so you can either embrace them and then and then embody those thoughts or you can take a double barrel shotgun of an Old and New Testament am me and blast that thing to smotherin like brother R says like like birds like we you got sparrows here you can't do it but he said about crows they'll you know they'll build a nest and you know they and then if you allow them to build that nest and they have children they'll grow they more and more and more crows it's like thoughts you can let it come it can start building a nest get bigger it can have children can grow and expand become more real or you can be like a farmer with a shotgun and say I'm not having this thing this carrying thing that doesn't belong on my farm I'm nesting on my property you get your shotgun and blasted the smother Rings it's the same thing so so how do you do that you take the word of God that's contrary to that thought and say I believe that word Lord so when the devil says you're alone you're never going to make it you blast that thing away by saying here is my present help and time of trouble he's my shield he's my reward he's my shepherd he's my salvation He's My Redeemer he's my king of kings he's my Lord of lords he's my God and by the end of the when you stop finishing quoting that you'll be feeling rejoicing and shouting you not be able to remember chapter and verse but if you know the attributes of God you'll be shouting by the end of that by the end of that blasting amen amen so this is what we're going to do Hallelujah is is is that we're going to blast the thoughts of the devil away you know like you know like you with Brother Isaac Hatfield I only heard him preach once in my life just on tape you know but then when brother Andrew said he couldn't come and things were arranged differently I felt more excited about Camp you know than before cuz I saw God's hand but then the devil was like like well how do you know it's going to go well you've only heard him once he's just 24 you know what if it bombs now I could have listened to that or I could have got a shotgun out and said the shepherd has rearranged what's going on not me he has rearranged it it's going to be a glorious time see you see I could listen to the Mind battle you know because there's always fear comes in you know the devil never brings stability you know you begin to feel down and anxious and stressed that ain't God that ain't God that you you got to look at the proof of the pudding you know you can have a see it says it's water but it's when you drink it you know it's water or not it could be any any solvent any any any liquid that's colorless and there's a lot of different ones right so it's like a thought can sound so good but what's it doing to you what's it producing am mean does it produce Joy a greater love and appreciation for the Lord a greater love for your family for one another you know does it make it make you love people more cuz that's God right to have a feeling for people that's God giving you that feeling to a care and a burden a concern and a love you know that's God's thoughts Hallelujah right you you know you love the word more that's God's thoughts right but then if the Devil comes in and you're feeling down and oh the you it's never going to work for you I don't know if this really works you know I don't I don't know if it's going to help me you know I'm just in this trouble and I don't see I don't know how I'm going to get out I just I guess it's just how I am you know that a't God uh and that ain't you that's the devil you see so any thought that makes you feel isolated shall up troubled insecure down depressed that's not God right so that's why we got to take the word of God and blast that thing out am remember you're armed and dangerous amen you're armed and dangerous from the oldest to the youngest of us you're armed and dangerous even even like little Willam me sing sometimes Jesus loves me this I know that's like grenad being thrown over in Devil's Kingdom to me that's powerful that's like a bomb growing off why cuz it can change your whole atmosphere Hallelujah it can and it's just a little kid just wandering around doing this thing you know so never underestimate your weapon you just we should just pull the safety off Hallelujah no warning shots we shoot to kill okay we shoot to kill then we go home okay take a photo testimony and go home you know let's not let's not muck around with the devil no more I'm speaking to myself as well but you know well you know that won't work cuz you've been with you know I've been with you so long oh there's got to come a time when the when the relationship ends amen hallelujah amen we're we're sure see see the thing is familiar spirits are familiar so so so you get used to thinking a certain way it become sick nature to think a certain because remember the devil wants to change our thinking now I can't remember who what politician it was in some debate but they're talking about something and and and and this politician said you have no right to change the thinking of my people to match what you're trying to do and that's what the devil does he's trying to change our thinking to make us think differently about the word of God and about ourselves he's trying to change The Narrative of History come on now to make us think differently you see we can't we can't let him do it see and he wants you to think differently about yourself he's never going to say stand on my neck cast me out expose me for who I yeah no no I am a Tormentor that's right yes I'm your T you know he's never going to tell you that he's never going to expose himself he's always hides in the shadows I'm not trying to make a joke well what don't you think about it you know he'll never say yeah I'm not God yeah um I have no future for you yeah actually all I have is a lake of fire it's not even mine and I'm going there and I'm trying to take you with me you know it's like Delilah with Samson she didn't say how can I tell me how to destroy you Samson that's basically what you were saying oh but I thought you love me you there should be no secret you manipulation the devil manipulates right but yeah she didn't say now now Samson look this is my this is why I'm here I there's a lot of money waiting for me let me tell you how much guess how I'm going to get it I need your secret so tell me how I can destroy you the devil doesn't come that way he always comes with a manipulation thing the thing is Samson that became a familiar spirit in his life and it dragged him down but if he just say stayed with a source of strength that thing never would have overpowered him so that's why the devil tries to make us think a certain way all the time just like if you always think negative see it's actually in brain physiology that your neurons and Things become certain Pathways because you think a certain way your brain rewires based on your thinking so if you always think negative it's actually physiologically your brain changes and that's why it's so easy to think that way but if you just change your thing you say hold on that's right am Hallelujah the Lord Jesus has saved me when I was a sinner he died for me amen when I gave his heart to me maybe a young child he's actually kept me I'm still here I'm still in spite of me I'm still here amen you know he's called me I believe he you know his word has called me to his side I think that should change he's made me an overcomer because the devil says well how do you know you going to overcome well what you were is not what you are amen amen what's happening you are climbing the mountain amen you're not down in the dungeon no more you're climbing the mountain right what are you doing you're overcoming amen praise God you're built to overcome amen yes sir amen so so we can stand in Victory I'm just going to as I said about to close but you know we can we are standing in Victory this morning we are standing in Victory you know the because the Lord Jesus has won the war he has conquered everything that can be conquered right he is the great Overcomer and then by the the Holy Ghost has come into your life and now you're overcoming see the devil loves to diminish our experiences that's why there's a testimony that that that that sister Brahman said that the Lord spoke and said this is more Supernatural Camp than it appears right because he say well we're just having camp and there's food and there's activities and there's Services you know it's just everyone's getting along it's more Supernatural than it appears and your life is more Supernatural than it appears amen Joseph's life was very Supernatural you think well he just had a couple of dreams that was the Supernatural part no that was the beginning because his whole life was now connected to those dreams and his whole life from those dreams to when he got to the throne and then his brothers came and everything was a manifestation of that dream now we are living in that time his Christ is calling his bride and then when maybe I'll um Christ is is calling his bride then we go to the wedding supper then Christ reveals himself to the Jews amen now let's just read a I'll just read one scripture and then then and then one quote then we'll have the musicians amen but you know therefore brethren we are dead is not to the flesh um to live after the flesh if if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the flesh you shall live for as many are as led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God hallelujah for ye you know that leadership can be so simple I feel to pray I feel to read I feel to come to church and and and and and even if your fleshes don't do it but there's something in you says I got to do it you know it can be simple everyday things amen for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption where where we cry Abba Father amen if you received the Holy Ghost that's God you've received the spirit of adoption you know who your father is amen the spirit itself beareth witness with spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also uh that we may be also glorified together so we join ears all that he did all that he fell ear to we've received amen we're joint ears amen didn't didn't earn it but we receive it praise God all all his victories all his Dominion we fall a too amen by his grace Hallelujah now amen okay I just i' read a couple of quotes I'll just read this one now because remember the battle isn't over we had a lot of Victories at camp but we're still in these bodies upon this earth oh yes okay so the battle I mean sure there's a lot of battles won but the war is still raging amen but the word says we're going to win the war so let's not just let's rejoice in Camp but let's keep pushing forward amen amen cuz we can't live just on past victories there's more victories to win God wants to reveal himself more to us he wants to open his word prove himself more in our lives amen so so we got to realize that we're still fighting amen that that you know for all of our god-given rights every Divine promise of God now he says as in restoration of the brid tree to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it or bring it back to its natural state where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition now to me that natural condition is a condition based on the word I mean not just a natural human condition but it's actual proper condition amen and in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there is a if there is a law to enforce its rightful condition of restoration to restore like if somebody stole my property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner into its liable First Estate amen remember our first estate was in God's thinking Made In His Image amen that's our first estate amen enforce then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan this is you right now yeah amen you have this privilege isn't it good you have a privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us amen for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan say give it back and he has to do it amen because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's because the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully def deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church has given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon Him amen see the devil says you have no right to claim that you said no no God gave me that right that's it God gave me the right you have no right Satan to tell me I have no rights because God gave you my rights and Satan you have a right to remain silent anything you do will be maybe used against you in evidence amen and we have the best forensics team in the world the holy ghost that doesn't leave any piece of evidence undone Hallelujah that now everything the devil does will be used against him in evidence amen hallelujah and remember the chief judge became our attorney amen amen so now the chief Supreme judge the Lord Jesus Christ became our attorney and he's fighting on our behalf amen hallelujah he is your Advocate amen he is he is your intercessor he's your mediator amen he's your lamb he's your high priest he's all in all amen so remember he's fighting your battle amen and if God be for us who can be against us amen see that's more than just a nice scripture that's a reality there's a lot of things against us I could just keep going on and on but you got to realize God was for me back there he's for me now and he shall be in the future Hallelujah so we have a right to take out let's take our god-given rights amen every Divine promise of God is yours right now amen the devil says it ain't you say no no no it is and you have a right to tell Satan where to go in the name of Jesus Christ we have nothing to fear we have nothing to fear amen because our God is not a God that has some wrestling match with other gods no he is the god of gods he's the Lord of lords he Supreme and he's defeated every enemy amen so let's go forward this coming year and let's walk in Victory amen Walk In Love walk in peace Walk In Joy now I think brother Isaac Hatfield said in the last service enjoy the walk amen enjoy the walk enjoy it when it's good enjoy it when it's hard enjoy it when it's sunny enjoy it when it's raining just enjoy the walk enjoy it when it's Troublesome how can you enjoy it when it's Troublesome because God wants to show himself in the trouble amen when it's when you're on the mountain top enjoy it we're in in the valley and God's you know you you're being molded and shaped enjoy it cuz it's work all things work together for good just like sister Tabitha's you know testimon all things work together for good amen so let's just walk on Amen why because I don't may maybe I'll go into it next Sunday or something but you know we are here to manifest the Lord God speaks and he lives amen and God has a voice in this end time it's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen let's just stand to our feet amen this morning let's just keep walking on the devil tries to make you feel condemned say no no no there's no therefore no condemnation then which you're in Christ to walk after the spirit amen can we have the musicians please you
