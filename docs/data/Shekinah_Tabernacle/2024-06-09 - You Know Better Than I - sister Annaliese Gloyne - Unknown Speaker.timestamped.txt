[0:00] God bless you brothers and sisters. Um
[0:03] this song is a real testimony to me. Um
[0:07] being near the start of the year and
[0:09] till like a month ago I was really
[0:12] struggling and um like on the outside I
[0:15] looked fine but then on the inside I was
[0:17] just like really hurting and every night
[0:19] I would like cry and I would be like why
[0:21] am I here? Like I don't understand. And
[0:24] then I got this song and it's a real
[0:26] blessing to me and I hope it's just a
[0:28] blessing to you as well.
[0:35] [Music]
[0:42] I thought I did what's right.
[0:46] I thought I had the answers.
[0:50] I thought I chose the shest road, but
[0:55] that road brought me here.
[0:58] So I put up the fight
[1:03] and told you how to help me.
[1:07] And now when I have given up, the truth
[1:12] is coming clear.
[1:15] You
[1:17] know
[1:19] better than I. You
[1:24] know the way.
[1:28] [Music]
[1:30] I've let go.
[1:34] The need to know why.
[1:38] But you know better than I.
[1:44] [Music]
[1:46] If this has been a test,
[1:50] I cannot see the reason.
[1:54] But maybe knowing I don't know is part
[1:59] of getting through.
[2:02] I've tried to do what's best
[2:06] and faith has made it easy
[2:10] to see. The best thing I can do is put
[2:14] my trust in you.
[2:17] For you know
[2:21] better than I.
[2:25] You
[2:27] know the way
[2:31] [Music]
[2:33] I've let go and the need to know why.
[2:40] For you know better than I.
[2:49] You know
[2:52] better than I. You
[2:58] know the way
[3:03] I've let go.
[3:07] The need to know why. For you know
[3:13] better than I.
[3:20] [Applause]
