morning amen God bless you all um just one announcement uh I'd like to I'd like to have a communion service communion foot Washing Service uh the evening of the 20th of September so don't pencil it into your diary p in your diary amen um yes so that would be that' be wonderful if we could have that uh that's only announcement um also if you could so the play centers moved out upstairs and um I had a quick look through and uh just pray because the price needs to be right and there's a lot of things that need to be done and it may not be a definite but we know that if the Lord uh doesn't want us there he'll have us somewhere else amen so just if you keep that in prayer that'd be very good thing um if you'd like to turn me to Genesis chapter 24 I just um I just like to continue on our thought about where we are in the end times and I want to you know there's many things that we can speak about you know about where we are and in time and these things but and we will cover those things you know as the Lord leads but I want to speak about the most important thing this is the most important thing and we'll just read the first seven verses of Genesis 24 and we understand this is the chapter where alas was sent to get a bride for Isaac and I want to show you that this this chapter is alive and well today it's even more alive than when it was lived out and alasar and Rebecca and these things that was just a shadow and we are living out the reality of it yes sir amen so we just we're just going to go through a bit of this here so he says and Abraham was old so verse one of Genesis 24 and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I'll make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go into my country and unto my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him pray Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring my son again into the land from whence thou comest and Abraham said unto him beware that thou uh bring not my son hither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife uh unto my son from then amen my the Lord bless his word you may be seated now you know as I said there's you know speaking about the end time and if you go on to YouTube or on the Internet you know there's there's a lot of uh talk of of the you know we're at the end of all things and we are at the end of all things but you know we could be many people can see what the pope is doing and the pope is doing many things he's fulfilling scripture we can see what the World Council of churches is doing which is the image to the Beast and they are fulfilling scripture and I'll cover these things later on but you know many people they look at those things they look at America and where she is standing and she is fulfilling scripture and we can also look at God's time piece Israel and they are fulfilling scripture they're all part of the end time plan and then we could also see that Russia is taking her position you know she is taking her position in the scripture and she is fulfilling you know she has become anointed because she is Anointed to destroy not only America but also the Vatican and so she is taking her position and we understand that brother Braham when he saw the seven major visions of 193 3 when it spoke of you know there would be Nazism and fascism and communism and the first two Nazism and fascism be swallowed up in communism but then it said he said watch Russia the King of the North and we understand as as you go into history Nazism raised up fascism raised up communism raised up and Comm communism swallowed up the first two isms but notice the Lord told him don't wash a Soviet Union watch Russia watch Russia the King of the North and because of that time when he began to Proclaim these things the Soviet Union was at its strength you know they were looking for another you know nuclear war they they believed was imminent between America and the Soviet Union but God was telling telling us don't worry about the Soviet Union wait until that that that crumbles and then Russia raises up again they're saying watch Russia the King of the North and we see Russia is taking her position and all these things are very important because they're part of the end time plan that God has placed in his wor but the most important part of his plan is that God would gather a bride for his son in this last day and because brother brandham he tells us he he preaches a sermon which is called a true sign overlooked and that and that true sign overlooked in the land is a prophet coming into the land because when a prophet is sent upon the Earth there's a major change being taking place like when Noah when Noah was here upon the Earth you know God was going to flood the Earth destroy the Earth and he was going to carry a people who would receive that that prophet's message that'd be carried over the Judgment into a new world and so it wasn't necessarily the sins of the people that were the signs of the times the true sign that was overlooked was Noah was standing there and he began to preach a message sent from God and it's the same thing when you when you see when you know when Moses was here you know he was a signed you know Elijah he was a signed John the Baptist was a signed every time God sends a prophet that is a true sign that God sends the prophet comes and he preaches the word word in its season and he declares to the people this is where you are in the scripture but many people they stumble over these signs and they look at say what America is doing and what the Pope's doing what the World Council of churches are doing and they look at all these things but they miss the true sign that's overlooked amen now brother bam he speaks this is after he preaches so he preaches a sermon uh this is uh this is from the voice of the sign in 1964 and in uh in balmont Texas he says a prophet himself is a sign the Bible said so which you see times lapsing and then see coming take the history of the Bible study it whenever you see a long lapse of time then uh and uh but just when you seen a prophet appear it was a sign of judgment God was going to judge the world all the nation or the people when you saw a prophet coming he preached a sermon I he said sorry he says I preached a sermon on that you take me and remember a true sign overlooked they always Overlook it they always have but it was a sign of coming judgment now his word is fulfilled his word is fulfilled in his voice what he promises then he fulfills his word by The Voice the coming of a prophet is a warning sign that judgment is at hand always has been he says let me just quote one look at Noah rising up in the last days of the Andel luvian World a prophet prophesying what was it judgment struck immediately after that Moses went into Egypt a Vindicated Prophet with the signs of a prophet what happened judgment struck Egypt right afterwards Elijah came on the scene the prophet and prophesied to Ahab and to that Nation what happened judgment Struck it right afterwards he says right John the Baptist come on as a sign and he goes on down but now there comes there comes a you know there comes a a time though where the what we look at now is a change and brother man speaks about it and what is the attraction on the mountain and he says and and in that sermon he he takes the text of Jesus right you writing up in Jerusalem on the back of the donkey and they say what is this and it says what is the attraction what's going on what's really going on here and he says he says this is just St says he said it was prophecy being fulfilled and about the time the prophet turned and said behold there comes a lamb of God to take away the sin of the world this is speaking of John the Baptist there prophecy being fulfilled now what's the attraction it's changed from the prophet to his prophecy so the attraction there's a time where there's the prophet upon the land and then the attraction turns now from the prophet to what he's speaking about what he's declaring that's where the attraction turns and so I just want to propose to you now a true sign overlooked because sure brother br's Ministry is a true sign because a prophet is a sign to the age that judgment's about to strike but a true sign but you know that was 50 years ago and so as I propose a question a few Sundays ago where are we at the end time because we've seen the son of man as been revealed you know Jesus Christ himself was manifested in the ministry of brother brandham and that was more than just a discernment and the angel of the Lord there the words coming out of his mouth that was Jesus Christ being revealed because he was revealing it was revealing Christ in the scripture so Jesus was being declared Paul said I preached to you Jesus Christ amen so he was preaching Jesus Christ and that was that was the son of man being revealed and so we can see because Jesus himself said as it was in the days of lot as was the days of Noah so shall it be when the son of man is revealed and you Luke 17 so we can see you know he says so we can read about now when the world is in that condition as was in the days of Noah and we can say we are in those days and then we can look and see the Sodom condition in the world again and we're living in those days and that was when God came in flesh and spoke to Abraham you know you know all know the story of world Genesis 18 said the Lord appeared to Abraham on the plains of mamory here came the of visitation where they would receive the promised son and God now you know God came in a human body he created a human body and stepped into it and and had a meal with Abraham and he said where is thy wife Sarah she's in the tent behind you and and God says to Abraham according to time of life which is speaking of a woman not a man according to time of life you shall receive the promised son and she's in the T behind laughing laughing within herself saying I'm old how can I please with my Lord this is impossible possible and God says why did Sarah laugh speaking to Abraham and she came out and said no I didn't laugh said yes you did and that was and Jesus did the same thing to the woman at the well revealed who she was and everyone's life and all these things and and Jesus said now in the end time that will that Ministry my ministry will be repeated but instead of Jesus coming in a body like you know how we were the first time he took a redeemed son of man a redeemed man and stepped into that body and declared himself to the Nations and and we can and that was a sign of the end but now I want to propose to you now because that was 50 years ago that manifestation brother bam tells us this is the last sign the church will get before the world is burned the last major sign amen because after God came down in Genesis 18 spoke to Abraham the called out group then he went down and and fire fell upon Sodom and it was destroyed so was the last major visitation but part of that visitation I just want to propose you now part of the end time where we are is now as I said it changes brother speaking about it changes from the prophet to the prophecy so it changes from himself now to what he's Min you what he's prophesying of speaking will come and then so we have to look now turn from the man and look at what he spoke about and his prophecy now was he was sent and this is why he was sent he was sent to turn your hearts to the faith of the fathers that you'd be United with Jesus Christ you'd be married to him this is why he was sent it's not just to no Bible Doctrine is that you'd become one for the very creator of heavens and earth youd become one with him and then you'd be taken up in a Rapture that's why the message was sent brother B says my message is that he is here yeah we sung that song and he is here and God is here and I'll go into that he is absolutely here I want to see Jesus Jesus is here amen amen Jesus is is here right now if you can believe it he's here right now and so his prophecy was his prophecy was there's going to be a bride there's been churches churches Brides brides but there's got to come one he speaks about so that was his prophecy there's coming one and he said that she she spoke of it as wheat because we're wheat amen the wheat is gathered into the Garner right and so the bride it's just it's just a different using a different name but it's the same thing the wheat of the kingdom is the bride of Christ and he said the wheat is here he said this back in the 50s and 60s the wheat he's saying the bride is present I mean that part of the Bride is already present and now we have lived down Through the Ages down here a few Generations down the road and we're all still part of that number amen y so he's saying now he's saying the bride is here and he said his ministry was to unite Christ the man and the woman the church the bride unite them as one when he preached you know the invisible Union he was it was actually like a a marriage ceremony going on Amen this was the this is why John the Baptist was here he was the he was the friend of the bridegroom and he speaks about it and he was to introduce when he called the people out he was calling out a bride for the promised son amen and then and then when he so he called the people out was preaching and then the bridegroom came he said there's one standing among you the bride he basically could have said the bridegroom is present amen and then when he saw the spirit of God you know he saw that this is the Lamb this is the bridegroom Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world this is the bridegroom and then he United the two together he says I must decrease he must increase so basically saying don't hang around with me I'm just introduce you and now I've introduce you go on your way amen amen it's the same thing John he had the spirit of Elijah upon him to introduce the church to its head and the same thing brother BR God said I send the the spirit of Elijah upon the Earth what's the purpose to unite the church and its head Christ amen that they would become one amen and so a true sign that is overlooked now because we've turned from the prophet to its prophecy is a true sign overlooked now is the bride coming into her position amen that is a true sign of the end time where are we amen you say well I I need to know where we are in the end time look in God's mirror yes and see how it is living out of you amen when your character his character becomes your character his nature becomes your nature that would be partakers of the divine nature amen this is the true sign a true sign it's the prophecy now coming into manifestation are you all following me so far you say well I don't know if I'm going to make it if you're ordained to make it God has held back god god holds back all the enemy and what he thinks he's doing yes our woman comes forth made in made in God's image and when she is so exactly like him he's going to take her off off this earth right that is so you know we can look at Israel and we can look at Russia and we can look at all these things sure we can keep those things in mind but don't major on those things amen God's one focus is you the Bride of Jesus Christ is God's one Focus he doesn't really care hey all those things are working for his will but that's not his main focus you are his main focus the Bride of Jesus Christ is his main focus am amen so we must always remember that now that the prophecy we we we're we're to look now from the prophet to the prophecy and then we should look at now where is the bride in her position is she a little girl is she a teenager or is she a mature woman amen amen he say well I've only been a Believer maybe a few years God said he'll do a quick short work at the end time a rapid time of maturity will come forth just meet him amen that's all you have to do become one with Isaac amen that's all you have to do and then he'll mature you he'll grow you amen that's right that's all you need to do now because God now God always has a living witness upon the Earth he always have a living witness and so we are because brother ad tells us he says that the that the bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age amen yes so the bride the ones who have become one with Christ not just church joiners not just you know cultural message people but really meet him they their life is the final voice and they're the true sign overlooked now am people stumble at the Simplicity of God becoming one with his people and so that true sign overlooked if I might just add to it I might say is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen coming into her position because once she comes into her position then she's taken off this Earth that's all that God doesn't care about the Vatican it's just a tool God doesn't care about Russia it's just a tool God doesn't care about world Catholic churches it's just a tool God cares about Israel because he's going to turn to Israel but before he can turn to Israel he has to take you out of this place that's amen so that's why you know we can go to God always now God always uses man to preach his gospel we see this in Acts chapter 10 the angel comes to Cornelius he doesn't preach the gospel he says go get Peter he said I I'd love a Heavenly being to come and preach the word to me God uses man and he and he sends two guys and they go and they get this guy Peter aiter man can't sign his own name he begins to speak preach to them it wasn't when the angel preaches when God used an anointed vessel and preached his word and the spirit of God fell upon those people amen and so and that is the way all the way down through now let's just turn to to uh Revelations chapter 10 I just want to drop a few things in because we alaza does not only just speak of speak of the enti messenger and I'm going to show you in the word but also speaks of the people who have come under that same anointing amen because we have the same Ministry of reconciliation that we have become one with God and now the very intent and the purpose of the bride of Christ is that other others would come to know him as well sir y amen hey I'm I trust that is the main focus of your life if there not for people on the street it should be for your family amen that they must know him amen doesn't matter how young hey I have it in my little mind if my if my baby can respond to me can recognize me she can sure recognize the one who made her amen amen amen now we read many times we read Revelations 10 1-7 but I just want to go on from Revelations uh 107 because remember we're going from the prophet to his prophecy speaking of future things now he says now but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so in the days of his voice and we're living in those days because that voice was recorded that you could hear that voice and absorb that voice become one with that voice amen amen and now and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth which is Christ and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said to me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be uh in thy but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so it's sweet when you talk about it but there's a purging that has to go on this old life Must Die amen so that's why it can be bitter in the belly because when you when you receive it it's wonderful but then now these things are going to be taken out of you and things got to be molded and you know your old nature must die that's when it becomes bitter and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth uh sweet as honey is as soon as I'd eaten that my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and kindreds um many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings now we understand that John John did not do these things and John himself is a symbol in the Book of Revelation we read in Revelations 4:1 when he said after these things after the seven Church ages there's a door was open in heaven and a voice said come up hither and I'll show you things to come and that is showing now John was representative there of the Bride that is raptured with the both the dead and Christ Rising first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the cloud so John himself is a symbol in the book amen and so John here is not just speak of himself because he did not go you know he did not go on a big Evangelistic tour after after he wrote This Book of Revelation you know but he went to the church at Ephesus and he passed that when he was released so now John here is speaking of a people he's not speaking of just himself when he said thou must prophesy again and thou must eat the book and these things but he's speaking of an end time people that the word has been open to that Christ has been revealed to and so we are under a mandate from God we're under a commission y amen that thou must take what has been received you must become one with it yes amen don't just talk about it and and maybe tack it onto your life but it must be the very strength of your life am man shall not live by bread Al but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah but how do you know it's out of the mouth of God because God will take a vessel and he'll vindicate that vessel with scriptural evidence a scriptural Vindication and that's how you know it's God Amen when brother AR can say now he's here and you know has the prayer line in these things and he says now this is just like it was in Genesis 18 and God came down and spoke to Abraham or just like how Jesus went to the woman at the well amen I'm just talking you to contact your spirit he where where exactly he was taking Jesus out of history and saying that same that same scripture maybe that you just read is being lived out right here amen because the son of man was being revealed amen that's right amen the you know the ministry was repeating itself and God and these things you know types and shadows are not just oh I you know that's neat that that story ties in it's not like that that's right he's saying all the condition chrans how the Believers were there how the unbelievers were there The Things They Came against all those things are repeating themselves amen types are very important where you can say because we can look at the word and if Jesus said this is how it was in the days of Noah it shall be like this we can go back to that day and we can see the same anointings that were upon those people have come upon these people and the same thing it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah we can see the anointings that were on them are the are the anointings that are out here today yes sir amen so now John is told now thou must prophesy again now this word prophesy is to speak under it's to it is to prophesy to foretell things but also means now to speak under inspiration and many would many would say well I'm not a preacher but your life speaks amen your life your life is a sermon that's right you are the only Bible many people will ever read is is your life you may never say a whole bunch but your life is preaching amen when you drive down the street when you walk into the supermarket when you pick your kids up or whatever you know you do everyday life you are preaching on the street corner amen you're life is being read your written epistle read and known of all men whether you're conscious of it or not your life is preaching amen so thou must he says You must prophesy again you must speak or you must live under an inspiration amen because not everyone not everyone is a minister but everyone must eat the book amen everyone must become one with Christ in the first Exodus they had to eat the lamb they had to become one with that lamb didn't matter if they had to eat the head or the tail or whatever it was he said eat the whole thing and some things are real wonderful in the word amen we have eternal life we have salvation without money or Price Jesus loves us those things are wonderful those are like the lamb racks or whatever you like on the lamb but there's other things which if you put your hand to it you know that the world will despise you and will judge you and will speak evil of you that's right amen but Jesus said blessed are you if the world speaks evil you know against You Without a Cause amen so there's some parts of the Lamb you must become you must eat it yeah you must if you want the full benefits the full benefits is a rapture amen we are here to leave amen amen and we're in the season of The Rapture amen where Heaven has expanded itself down to gather you up and take you up into glory and so we don't want to just have a good life and then be left behind there's people that are going to be left behind we don't want to be in that number amen we haven't given our lives that would be left behind and God hasn't sent this message to leave you behind God has sent this message and we'll go to Alas I'll show this God has sent message that you'll become one with Isaac and she isn't left in the place that she was born amen she isn't left in that same country she leaves that country she says I'll go Hallelujah and the only factor that caused her to leave her country was she said I'll go it was down to her decision and when you say when you say in your heart you say I'm I'm done I'm going to go Hallelujah wherever this word tells me to go I'm going to follow this word I will go amen then everything else must give way and you have to go amen the power of decision your decision will dictate where you want to go well there's predestination we're in time am mean if you've been sealed into the kingdom then you can say I'm predestinated cuz the anoint the the the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism is only for the elected ones amen but we don't just want to take this haphazard I'm not talking about earning your salvation don't get me wrong well you know I want to live in Victory amen I want to live in total victory I want heaven in my home every day amen I want heaven in my car when I drive I want heaven in my in my workplace amen doesn't matter you know and you don't have to be in a corner praying and doing all kinds of things just live have Fellowship one with another God if we walk in the light as hears in the light we have Fellowship one with another is that just in church is that just when you open your Bible is that just when you go and pray and your as I said my secret place is everywhere everywhere I am is my secret place that's right everywhere in the mall yes in the mall on the street on the street at work yes at work amen wherever I go there's my secret place Hallelujah so that's the that's the big mitigating thing is is is when she said I will go now so we are under a mandate now we must prophesy again now this this this is not to uh speak something different but it's just to Echo what we have already received received amen like Joshua Joshua was given a commission place the people in the land he didn't bring another word he he took the word that Moses was given and he was told to meditate upon that and if he meditate upon that then they'll be successful he didn't preach a different message to them he they just carried the same message that they were given in the wilderness in the mountain it's the same thing with us we've been given a word all the mysteries of God are finished we don't need to wonder and and kind of probate maybe I think this is what the word says God has shown shown his light upon the word and we know what everything is from Genesis to Revelation amen it's not a mystery amen God doesn't want to hey you and your wife or you know your spouse there should be no secrets between husband and wife amen no secrets amen it's the same thing with us and God there's no secrets between us and him he told us who we are he told us where we're from he told us where we're going amen he told us who the enemy is he told us how he works amen he told us a secret to overcome him Hallelujah he told us things that the church World probes ad and wonders about you have a man stand up Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Brandon and apparently when he studied that that sermon he had his Bible in a concordance when he when he put that sermon together and he stands up he says now I'm going to tell you the secret that God had in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world Amen it's more than a man more than a man declaring things yes I've never heard another preacher stand up and say I'm going to tell you the secrets with the the back part of you know back parts of God's mind glor you ever heard someone say that here comes a man just with the Bible of Concord and studies it out oh here's the secrets of God's mind before the foundation of the world wow amen amen hey Glory you talk about you talk about a prophet messenger amen that stood there and declared what God not not what not just what the people were thinking but what God was thinking amen amen and that whole sermon which he speaks he expands about the threefold mystery you know that's in the seventh C he speaks about God would have you know you know and he speaks about God having preeminence in the people and all these different things he's declaring now this is what I want this is my secret and he's saying this is what this is the relationship I want with you that become one with you and I would have preeminence as the head amen and we'd have a perfect relationship like there's never been you got listen to the sermon now so we are just to declare now what has been given and that's what it means why we must prophesy again God as I said God always has a living witness and we are that witness we are that witness that Jesus Christ is alive and well amen we are the proof that this message is real because it produces the life of the scripture in US yes amen now it's like brother he says he says now he says but you're supposed to live your sermons he says Oh how we needed Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or Shout but what hurts the devil who wants to know what hurts the devil yes What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen amen he says we need thousands of lived voices what's that thousands of one standing prophesying again what has been revealed speaking it living it out now alas we understand is this I I trust you've still got Genesis chapter 24 open in handy now the servant here that that that Abraham commissions this one that is the elder servant he is this he is Alazar of Damascus that that that that Abraham speaks about Genesis chapter 15 now we read here that this this servant was No Ordinary Servant one he was the head servant but two we see that that Abraham tells him that God will send his Angel before you to prepare to prepare the bride for Isaac so you know very few other I've never heard of any other servant you know in the you in the scripture that that the the master says God will send not just that I will do something God will send his Angel amen before you and then number two all the goods of this master were given into the given into his hands that's why he took the camel train all that the father had all that Abraham had was placed on these camels to to to be taken to get this Bride for Isaac amen and so this is incredible because now we have to say th so this would be the most powerful ministry that's ever struck the Earth would be represented in this man and there's very few incredibly few in the scripture that they had the angel of God in the Ministry amen and there's only one that had the very son of man Ministry and that is brother brand that's the only you know Paul had visitations of angels irenius and the early church you know Messengers they had visitations of angels but very few they did not have the son of man Ministry that brother brandham had amen here came now cuz God you know it's like if you had a business just like you take a country if it's some Little Country they'll send maybe some little Diplomat to go talk to the people but if it's someone they really want to impress and woo they go themselves and they bring the biggest gifts and they they lay out the red carpet they all do all these things because they want to impress them because it's an important job now the reason Abraham sent such a powerful servant is because this was the most important job because without a bride how can Isaac's line continue how can the promised seed how can the Redeemer come no he had to be married and he had to be married to the right kind of woman that's why when Abraham said don't take a woman out of these Canaanites for my for my son go back to my house find a blood relation find one that's related to me that has the same characteristics as my son Hallelujah hey families have the same characteristics and that's why I said go to my father's house and get and get a bride and and we can see that now when God found you when God found you he wasn't finding someone who wasn't one of his children he wasn't finding one who wasn't part of the family amen he was when he found you see this message has come to you to unite you with Christ and God is Not haphazard at who he gathers all that the father has given me will come and all that come to me I'll no wise cast out Jesus said so he's saying that they've all been given but they must come yes and that's why this word has been sent your way is that God would God would gather you because he knew that you were part of him amen that's why he said go to my father's house to get you know go to the land of my Kindred to get Bri uh you know Isaac a wife to be family you say how could you say well you're talking pretty highly of the Bride absolutely amen she is the elect Lady of all the ages amen that is part of God hey species marry species That's the Law of God I'm not talking about your Humanity friend you just put that on the shelf and forget about it I'm talking about the real you that's that that very thing in you that responded said yes I'll go that wasn't your feelings or how happy or sad or glad whatever you were something in you said this is me amen I've heard the Master's Call hallelujah hallelujah I will go that's that real part of you that's been redeemed and so now he and so saying well if species marry species then you have to be God part of God yeah in order to be United with God Amen you say that is just too much that's not too much Paul said he became us in a m in a matter of words he said he became me that I might be become him by Grace Hallelujah that this flesh man would would decrease and the real you would come forth yes amen so that's why he said now go to my Kindred and get and get my my uh my son a wife from there and then so this one now he had all the goods of the father and that's why you see in brother braham's life have you had another Ministry that created had spoken word creation created squirrel spoke Chim out of his wife did all the spoke a stor out of existence all these different things you won't find it what's happened here come all the goods of the father coming down because she's very important I want to put out a red carpet for her amen because she's she's the worthy one I've made her worthy that's not that you've made yourself worthy that's irrelevant hey satan says you're not worthy you say who cares I don't care your your opinion your opinion of yourself doesn't matter his opinion doesn't matter God's opinion is the only thing that matters you never forget this God's opinion of you what did he say about me he didn't say you're trash and you're up and down and you're unstable and you're not even worth it that's not what God has said has said she is sinless she is perfect in my sight she's part of me she is Mrs Jesus Christ everything that I've been looking for in a woman is in her amen I mean the the nature the character amen how she conducts herself amen hallelujah Glory this is what I've been looking for amen yes sir Amen to say What God Says About You you say devil shut up I don't care amen I'm done amen we're done we're through amen now so he came down with all the goods and so Alazar now we'll just read from I just want to go from Genesis chapter uh 24 I want to go down from verse 7 cuz I want to show you in this that Rebecca now she's living her life when when when alasa commission when when Abraham says God will send his Angel before you she's just living her life she has no idea what's going on she does not maybe she knows that Abraham you know she has distant family and some distant country she maybe knows those things but she's just living her life and then so we have this now and the Lord God Of Heaven oh we'll just read this again as well and the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spoke unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land and he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from th and if the woman will not follow be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear of this thine oath only bring not my son again and the servant put his hand this is verse n and his and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear unto him concerning that matter and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia and to the uh uh city of of uh n and he put his camels to kneel down without the City by The Well of water at the time of the evening even the time that woman were to go out to draw water see the timing in the Bible is very significant he didn't say in the morning time you know I think we s sing that song as an ancient you know uh you know by H you know Wayside well early in the morning it wasn't early in the morning it was in the evening it was the evening time when this when this servant who had everything that the father possessed amen you're with him he came in the evening to get the bride amen and it's in the evening time now when the servant that's had the most powerful Ministry and record go have a look through go through look look through history there hasn't been another Ministry like this ministry it's in the evening time when the father centered upon the Earth Amen to find you that's why I can say this this is not only you know brother Brown's Ministry but it's all the ministry 5old ministry under him amen has come because we're still a living witness we're still a living voice now and then notice now we're just going to read a few more he says he says now um uh verse 12 and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray the send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and it came to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let uh let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I'll give thy camels drink also let the same be she that has been appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou showest kindness unto my master and it came came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebecca came out which was born of Bethel son of um son of uh milka the wife of n Abraham's brother and a picture upon her shoulder and the damel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up now we're just going to leave it there but you know he praise this so she's just living her life and the evening time was when they went out and got water she would have done that every day y this was just everyday living it's like I need to go to the supermarket and buy this and maybe I do my grocery shop on this day that's just everyday living she's going down to get water she has no idea that there's someone who's who's in her presence that has been commissioned by the Father Abraham and he's the head servant and an angel of God not only that the angel of God has already gone before to prepare her to receive his visitation and so here comes you know here comes this and then what happens we understand is that she she gives him a drink you know you can read the whole thing but just to save time she gives him a drink and then she says I water your camels as well and so he just prayed this and now she's living out his prayer and she has no idea she has no idea what she's doing but she's living out the prayer of the servant amen hallelujah and then so she begins to you know and then where up to and then you know she does this and then brother Brenham now he tells us he tells us that the very if I can find it he says this in Char us the father in 54 he says then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever is that right what he did then he can do now is that right we love him we believe him we've got our souls magnetized with power tonight that'll take us up in the Rapture over I think of that beautiful Rebecca that afternoon watering the camels watering the very thing that was going to take her the bride the water that it says the camels represent power and the Church of the Living God is rejoicing and watering the power of the Holy Ghost that'll pick her up someday and take her Yonder to meet Isaac in the air for the wedding supper he says hallelujah amen you believe it amen so to the very one we we praise and we Rejoice you know you know and we give Glory too amen and we and and we pray to him we live for that is watering that power amen amen that is watering the camel amen hallelujah that that thing that you're watering and you're worshiping am me one day is going to pack you from this world into the next World amen hallelujah amen so she was doing that now she had no idea what this guy all she knew is here comes a man and he's got camels and he's traveled a far away and now she is she is literally well she was literally watering those same beasts that were going to take her to her husband but at this stage she didn't know about Isaac she had no idea about all these things she was just living but I want to say she was divinely inspired amen amen she was being she was anointed with the spirit of God she had no idea she wasn't even conscious of it hey we do things we do things day by day we're not even conscious that the very life we live is because we're anointed by a different Spirit we're anointed by almighty God himself amen am mean the bride hey we don't just meet God when we come in here or when we pray God is with us he says I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee amen you say I'm just you know you just doing going about your daily business I tell you we are the most anointed people amen you may say well I'm looking for thunder and lightning and all these kind of things look it's not it's not that it's people people who are what makes you reject this world cuz in the in in in humanity Paul said there's not one that seeks after God not one he says in the Book of Romans so what made you turn from going the way you used to went and there's something in you even though maybe the message never came your way but something in you said there must be more there must be more to life and even the church maybe ear you must thinking there must be more to it than this what's happening now you're coming under an influence amen that is not you am if we had our way we'd just go the way like the West you know rest of the world Amen but something something in US said there's more to life amen that and that and that that hunger did not come from you that thirst you didn't generate that thirst amen but now you alas you know the angel of God was sent before him and she came under an influence she was doing things she had no idea really the significance of what she was doing and then now when a people begin to hunger and thirst maybe sitting in some denominational tomb or or just out in the world maybe some totally different religion but says there must be more there must be more What's happen they've come under an influence amen from that unseen one the almighty God himself and it may be years down the road when finally the message comes their way am but they've been under an influence all that time Hallelujah am mean you say I just stumbled around no you didn't God directed your steps God knew when you would receive it God knew when you'd say I'll go am and God Was preparing you for that moment hey Rebecca it wasn't the first time that she would have taken Jes to the well to fill up and all this stuff she' done that every day i' say look honey the sun's gone down I'll go get the water now just what she did amen she was prepared before alaz you even arrive amen hallelujah and here you are I tell you you prepared for this amen you're built for this You're Made for This amen hallelujah Glory so now here he comes you know here he comes and I'm just trying to so the Lord now so the so this Angel who went before him he could have you know Eleazar could have said God went before me now some people ask a question now is Jesus here or is he coming and I can say he is here amen but then he's also coming because he is coming because we're still in these bodies we haven't been transformed we haven't been caught up the dead Christ hasn't raised you know first so so the end of his coming his coming hasn't been completed in that sense but I can say in a sense he's very much here amen and I can say that because one we have read Revelations 10 and the M Angel descendant and brother Ram said that the seventh angel is on the time of the Earth at the time of that coming you you hear about it in the breach so that's Christ descending so we can say he's here and then also I can say he's here because the Centurion you you going reading the scripture the Centurion that came to Jesus had a six servant who knows the story y he had a revelation he said you know others others like Jas who had the daughter that was sick they said come and lay hands and pray but this Centurion had a revelation that Jesus himself didn't need to go he says I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof but just speak the word because I'm a man out you know of authority and I say do this and people do this and you know and and he recognized the same thing in Jesus and so he said just speak the word word and she'll be well so he had the Revelation that him speaking the word was exactly the same as him self stepping into the house amen he had that he had that Revelation and I can say God's word is here amen the the full revelation of God which is Jesus Christ it his completion is present Among Us amen that God himself is here his word is here therefore he is here because him and his word is the same thing yes oh I want to see Jesus Jesus is present yeah amen Jesus Walks among us hallelujah and we as I said you the body change hasn't happened yet but I say he has come amen but he's coming you understand but the Centurion knew just speak the word because his word was the same as himself bodily going and God has sent his word hallelujah amen amen hey I think that's you know we should rejoice in that I need more of him he's already here everything he needs to of you is already present yes sir amen we don't need to I I want to see him one day you're seeing him now amen you seeing manifest himself now hallelujah amen so now this elazer he he comes down and then we'll just read from um let's just drop down now to verse 20 and she hastened and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water and Drew it for all his camels and the man wondered at her and held his peace to it whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not so she's living out his prayer and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half the shle weight and two bracelets for her hands of 10 shkel weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to Lodge in and she said unto him I am the daughter of Bethel the son of of milka which she bear unto n and she said over unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to Lodge in and the man bowed down his head and Worship the Lord and said blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth and I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's Brethren now you say well what what's this about jewelry we read later on that Jacob tells his wives in these things take off the Rings out of your ears put away your strange Gods because we're going to go meet the Lord this is in Genesis um where are we this is later on this is in Genesis now 35 you read it and so now what happens is this is symbolic now that the head servant is giving gifts to the bride what is gold deity what what is the ear hearing the word anointed to hear the word what's the braces on the hands The Works of her hands her service has been anointed amen and she had already done the service and she had no idea what she was doing by watering the camels Hallelujah so now because remember all of the father all of the father's house all of his possessions were given to the servant and he distributed it now and he gave what Rebecca needed and then now they go and I'm not going to read the whole thing but what happens now is is as Rebecca and alaz now they go back into her father's house alaza begins to speak to to her Kindred she doesn't know the she has no idea at this point she has no idea about Isaac she has no idea about the angel of the Lord amen amen she just watered this you know she just ordered this guy's camels gave him a drink found out that they you know his his master's related and then now she goes you know they go into the um her her father's house and then he sits down and begins to relate what we read there in the start of the chapter that Abraham is blessed you know above all things that he has a son called Isaac that I've been sent by my master to find Isaac a wife and and he told me to go to go to his Kindred so it wasn't just any woman but a specific woman I had to come find and now I have come to the well and Abraham said the angel of the Lord would go before me to prepare the way and then and then he said now and then I came here at the evening time just you know just a few minutes ago and I prayed that God would send that that bride right into my presence by the well and she's standing there she has never heard these things before but she is she begins to realize all of this that she had an idea about all this unseen going on hey all she knows is a guy some camels and and and and he's a servant that's all she knows initially but then the servant begins to testify to her father's house all these things and then she begins to realize everything he has done the very reason that he was sent the very prayer that he even prayed I know I had no idear he prayed these things I've just lived it out amen amen now I'm sure she begin to recognize the very reason I live these things out is because I'm the bride for Isaac Hallelujah and I don't know how how how much it's anchored into your soul but the very reason you responded to the word and you gave yourself to him and you repented and got baptized and you came forth a newness of life now a different life is living out of you as you did all that maybe not even fully understanding what was going on you came under an influence amen and all other religion just vanished all other life just vanished and things maybe you once did they just vanished and you gave yourself to this you know initially maybe you had no idea I've been I've been ordained I've been predestinated to be to be married Amen to the promised son hallelujah amen amen and then so she would have recognized he's talking about me Hallelujah the the Crux of the story changes from the from the servant now I'd say from the prophet to the prophecy here's the woman comes into view glory and now they begin to talk now and the father's house you know he gives them gifts as well and and you can read about in this you know in the in the story he you know he gives them gifts as well and then they try and delay they try and delay them leaving and they say well just stay for stay for a few more days you know he says this is verse 55 and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least 10 uh after that she shall go so there comes so there Comes A Time now so what happens is brother Braham that Elijah Ministry sent into the Earth and goes amongst the Pentecostal people and a great anointing falls upon not only North America but all over the world Divine Healing and all these things you know you hear I think it's like Gordon Lindsay's testimony or I think it's ER ba I might be wrong but they said before brother Brown's Ministry Came Upon the scene the Pentecostal move was at its lowest e it had basically virtually ceased to be and then now God sends this kind of ministry and and an anointing is p Just ped out everywhere What's Happening Here Comes the chief servant and gifts are given to churches and people are in Revival and all this was done now is because Rebecca was in those churches hey I know people even sitting here their churches were blessed denominational churches were blessed because because they were in that church amen gifts were sent into that church things were sent into that church because Rebecca was still there amen how you take Isaac and Shannon and all you know all these ones you know you hear their testimony about being at w these kind of churches why cuz they were there amen and there's others like up in taneki they in churches in in New Zealand and the church was blessed and they being young you know the eldest thought that these ones will carry the Church on then they receive the message and they pull out of the church and the church dies yes sir that's right why because Rebecca's there Rebecca's in the place and gifts are being given amen but then they had to and then you see they you know her her family didn't want her to leave cuz they're being blessed amen they were being blessed because she and the messenger were there but then as like any faithful messenger he does what he's told as quickly as he can and then he you know and then he fulfills Mission then he moves on Hallelujah and he said now he says hinder me not seeing the Lord has prospered my way send me a way that I may go to my master he said he says I'm not here for a holiday I'm not here to build some some some denominational church or some Empire to myself I just want to do what I meant to do and then move on Amen and you can see that with brother bram's life he had a he had a caravan with a typewriter that was his office old Roberts and all these ones had millions of dollars worth of buildings he speaks about it he's a man with a little you know people said have you seen brandom Tabernacle I'm sure you've seen pictures of it you know when they first built that people said we're going to turn that into a garage it's not some great big steeple some great big thing just it's just a brick building yeah and here was a place God came down God revealed things that had never been spoken they were in the scripture but had never been revealed before Hallelujah in this little building why is that he didn't want some Empire for himself amen amen we're not interested in building big things Hallelujah find the bride and get out that's why we're here and the sooner we find her the sooner we leave amen and the sooner we all come to our position we leave amen so don't sit back just say I'll go amen hallelujah that's all you need to do and they said we will call the damsel and inquire it out her mouth see this is why the the power for her to leave was in her power amen you say well the devil's got me down or I can't you know it's in your power that's right amen when you say when you when you begin to hate the thing that has held you back when you begin to hate the thing that Wars with you you must hate it if you worship it you'll never be free but if you hate it you'll be free you must hate the enemy and hate his works against you and when you come to that point then you say oh go then it must let then it must let go am mean you've got to hate it Hallelujah and so then she says and they called Rebecca and they said unto to her will we go with uh will thou God this man she said I'll go and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men and so her decision caused her to leave and go to the one she's meant to be married to now notice this and they said they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister and thou sh be thou the mother of thousands and millions and thy seed shall possess the gates of those which hate them yes now this same bless fell upon Abraham and they had no idea they were prophesying when they were blessing Rebecca they were prophesying speaking over her things that they were not even aware what they were doing and because this blessing Came Upon Abraham that his seed shall possess against the enemy and therefore that same blessing was passed down to Isaac so the one that was to be United with Isaac had to have that same blessing amen hallelujah that her seed amen will possess the gates of the enemy amen she had no idea that was in her that was spoken over her because it was in her amen hallelujah glory and now so the man and the woman have the same blessing put upon them Hallelujah you go read about Abraham the same blessing falls upon Abraham therefore it's upon Isaac cuz he's the son amen and then now remember Isaac's Christ and Rebecca's you and you say well Jesus conquered everything because the seed will possess the gates of the enemy and it did and it does hallelujah and and that was you know Jesus conquered every Dimension that could be conquered he conquered every enemy that could be conquered amen he is the boss he defeated everything and we say how glorious that is and it is glorious but then we must recognize now if that applies to him it applies to you because the seed thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy Hallelujah so now the woman that's why we can say we can do all things through Christ which strengthens me that means you can defeat possess every gate of the enemy amen you can you know when you possess a doorway no one else can get through that doorway amen if you're big enough no one's getting through the door if you say no that what it means to possess the gate so now that means now that whatever is wanting to get through can't go through amen hallelujah and so now if God is saying that you will possess because Christ is the seed of the promise but we're part of himen so every blessing that fell upon him because we're United with him falls upon us hallelujah and even because this blessing she hadn't become one with Isaac yet am mean she was ordained to become one with him all the blessings that fell upon him were already upon him she just had to recognize it and now she's caught up in this big Vortex of Prophecy and now the word comes your way Hallelujah and you hear about Jesus the name above all names and everything must bow to his name and he conquered everything amen and just to prove that he conquered everything he has you know he has proven it in the lives of Believers am mean where smoking or lust or some addiction or just the world or some religion or denomination or something and that's been put under their feet and that is a proof now that Jesus is the name above all names amen that he defeated Satan and that defeat is just as real then as it is now amen and so that blessing has fallen upon you that you can possess you shall amen he says I just want to read that again and let thy seed possess the gates of them uh of those which hate them so he says it's going to happen I think Abraham says Thou shalt possess thy seed shall possess against the enemy so it's going to be that way so every way the enemy can come against you you shall possess that gate amen amen if it's in your conscience if it's in your reasoning if it's in your affections if it's in your memory if it's in your imagination if it's in the things you see the things you hear the things you feel amen I thought it be some big fancy thing no you're possessed remember this this thing is to contact this world Amen and the same thing with our spiritual you know how we feel our feelings our imaginations all these things that is to really contact these kind of things faith is to contact God and the devil can't get to your soul but he'll get to your body and if he can't get to your body you'll anoint your spirit and make you feel down and do all these kind of things but you shall possess that gate amen God says you shall possess that gate Hallelujah so whenever the enemy comes against you you say no it's written thus sayith the Lord amen the seed I am the seed I'm part of the promise I shall possess the Gate of the enemy amen Hallelujah he conquered everything and now he's living that Victory out in you glory amen so they came under that same blessing you know you can just see how much the Believers are blessed in the scripture amen when when when balum is is taken by by Moab you know the king of Moab and balam you know the king of Moab says curse curse Israel cuz he's seen that fighting a natural war against Israel doesn't work go read numbers 22-25 and so the spirit of God comes upon balum and he and he tries to curse Israel and three times He blesses Israel and one time when the spirit of God comes upon me God is speaking now God speaking first person through a man and he says I behold no iniquity in Jacob amen and the king of Moab said come and look at the hinder parts of Israel Tak him to different places to see that you know the hinder parts are the bad bits and the people you know maybe the struggles in the camp and the sin in the camp and all these different things and God actually declares now I'm not condoning sin but you understand what I'm saying when God looks down to Israel he says I see no iniquity in Jacob Hallelujah when he looks at you when he looks at you he says I see no iniquity in my bride amen he says I don't even see it or the one that can see all things here and he's not just twisting the truth he says I see no iniquity because he's come under a covenant amen amen a blood Hallelujah that when when when God sees you he sees the blood he sees that life on display and if he sees that life he doesn't see your old ways he doesn't see your iniquity how I fail every day that's why God provided a lamb amen and the more we walk in this world the more we realize we needed a lamb and not just to save us but to keep us amen that we can still stand in this evil day hey we needed a lamb and God has provided himself a lamb Hallelujah say I'm wrestling with something just keep hey just give it to him it won't let go of me one day it will possess it like it already is is you already have the victory amen amen hey the battle the battle is the Lord sometimes the battle takes a while amen but don't give up just cuz the devil keeps maybe you know Paul said that uh you know your your enemy was buffering him and he besought the Lord three times he didn't suddenly quit and say I'm not an apostle anymore this is not going to work out up amen and the Lord said to him I give I've given you my grace is sufficient for thee now some things it's like that but some things the devil must let go and he's done make sure you know which one it is they say well I fell get back up the scripture tells us it's not him that falls it's him that gets back up amen that is the one amen hey a you know someone who's Victorious doesn't stay their face in the mud they get back up they say Lord try me one more time I've done it so many times that's why we have a lamb Hallelujah that's why God provided himself a lamb that's right you say well I keep doing things you know I have I have iniquity in my life he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities Hallelujah God knew you'd have them don't own them like they're part of you and that's just how it is don't put up with it that's right what it's done just watch the victory unfold amen hallelujah amen now she says I'll go and they begin to leave and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and they followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way now and Isaac came from the way of The Well of uh lari uh for he dwelleth in the South Country and that name actually means The Well of him that liveth and seeth me and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even tide so in the evening time now there's a uniting going on Amen Hallelujah in the evening time at the even tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming so notice now Isaac is not in in in his father's house or where his tents are but he's come to me he's he he's Advanced now from where his family living he's Advanced now towards now the bride is coming so they meet halfway between between his father's house and from where you know your Rebecca and and alasar are coming so so he's Advanced now that's why I say heaven has expanded I mean God has come down he's Advanced from Glory he's coming down to the Earth amen because Isaac now Advanced he wasn't staying in his mother's tent waiting for the camels to come there but he came out into the field at the evening time he Advanced towards where they were coming amen God is closer than your next breath I just say it that much God is closer than your next breath doesn't matter how you feel what you think about it God is closer than your next breath Hallelujah and he saw the camels coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and then and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel hallelujah amen and she had for she had said unto the servant what man is is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master and therefore she took a veil and covered herself so when she saw Isaac she said what man is this that walketh towards us and we can pose you I can pose the same question to you what man is this amen what man is this that is the Unseen one hallelujah amen that that is advancing towards us that walks Among Us amen that heals us when we're sick that Comfort us when we're when we're broken that lifts us up amen that comes and dwells in us what man is this me what man is this that has stirred our hearts Hallelujah that we don't just have a church but we want to go on a Rapture I mean we want to see his word be fulfilled what man is this I mean what man is this that has that has saved our Liv and mean the people have come into the church they've met they've met the Living God what man is this Hallelujah friends if we could recognize what God does among us daily amen that we're kept by the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that we have an expectation for a catching away you didn't put that there God put that there hallelujah what man is this Hallelujah it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself now the veil it's like when a woman comes down the aisle traditionally she has veiled and that is representing now that this man that is standing at the end of the aisle has become her head amen that she has no thought coming but she's coming under his headship that's why Rebecca herself and so now this also signifies that everything because in the Eastern Traditions the Jewish Traditions the woman wouldn't just take off her veil but she would remove the veil and put it on his right shoulder signifying that every all of her care all of her needs are going to come through that man and that's why when when Isaiah would speak about he says unto us a son is born a child is given and his name Shall be Called wonderful and counselor and the Everlasting father the Mighty God and the government shall be upon his shoulder the scripture tells us you go read Isaiah 9 and so he saying now that all her cares all her needs are placed upon his shoulder amen amen the scripture tells us cast all your cares upon Him for he carth for you amen he car you know just just give it to him hey he's got some strong shoulders there's no burden hey he he walked up Calvary with your with the sin of the world upon him and you have some need I'm not belittling the neede but he knows what it's like to pack a burden he knows what it's like to take responsibility Hallelujah when he said for this cause I've come into the world and that cause was I'm going to redeem my wife amen I'm going to take her shame and her sin and her unbelief upon myself Hallelujah and I'm going to take it and place it where it should be glory amen he took it upon his shoulder amen that's why just cast your cars upon him for he careth for you Hallelujah put it upon his shoulder and the servant took Isaac and all oh sorry and the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done hallelujah and Isaac brought her into her mother's into her mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death that same tent when Elohim came down and discerned her thoughts and said to her according to time of life you're going to have the promised son that tent amen that same place that's why the Lord comes now and we're United here amen we know we're going to because we're going to the marriage supper not to the marriage amen you we are united with him present here upon this Earth that's why they consumated the marriage now in the tent amen here this tent your your Dwelling Place amen he he unites himself with you here hallelujah amen amen so now this this whole scene is where we are in the end time this is the most important thing that God would take God would take a woman now brother says in a super sign he says now when the light stuck little Rebecca she knew something she knew something within her that had brought her to Isaac she veiled her face she wanted had no more to do with her own thinking Isaac was her thinking from then on and the church itself when it strikes that power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the denominational churches out of the Catholic Church wherever it is when that baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to people then that's predestinated uh like you people here to eternal life sees it and walks in it what is it he says a super sign it's a sign to the end time amen you want to see where we are in the end time I'm going to go into all those other things but I wanted to put because this is the most important thing cuz all the world is looking at Russia and all the world is looking at blood moons and all the world is looking at all these other things but they are overlooking the most important thing what is that most important thing a woman has heard a message and she said I'll go hallelujah amen a bride has been prepared for Isaac and she said I will go and now she's on her way off this Earth Hallelujah you know part of you is already raptured I'm I'm just going to close with us part of you is already caught up amen your soul is already caught up now your body just has to catch up amen amen part of you is already that's why the Rapture is for the raptured those who are caught up with God that's who the Rapture is for amen hallelujah amen we are we are the sign of the End Amen we are the sign of the end am you know you just read like Abraham's life as Abraham and he's called out and during that time cities are being built people are inventing new things nations are rising nations are falling Wars are being fought you know all the Sodom Gomorrah conditions are coming into place there's very little of it recorded you know there's only the book where lot's taking captive and all these different things but all this over the entire Earth all these things are going on in world history it's not in here because it's not important to God Abraham was important to God that's why his life in that part of time is recorded you following me God's eyes are upon Abraham and what Abraham was doing and when he'd received the promised son that's what God was looking at in that whole season and here you are and people are you know this social media all these this is happening this is happening this is happening all these things are happening God doesn't care he knows it's going to happen but that's not his Focus amen now the reason I say this say what are you looking at amen if hey if something's important to God we should look at what God is interested in amen amen amen now I don't mean become some ined n in some Hilltop Monastery someplace you know what I mean but what is your main focus upon in life amen I've heard the call I've become one with Isaac amen I'm watering the camels Hallelujah cuz that same one that we are rejoicing and worshiping is going to pack us away amen amen and all the rest of the world could just fade into nothing out our this hallelujah amen let's just
