I'm glad and free I'm happy glad and free hallelujah amen if you got the Bible handy I mean let's go to the book of John amen so we're going to read we're going to read from John 11 like we did on Sunday they were gonna go to revelations chapter 3 so we're going to read from John 11 and verses 25 down to verse 29 and then we're going to go to revelations 3 read verses 20 to 22 so John 11 and 25 says here jesus saith unto her speaking to martha i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth Elvis and she said unto Him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which you come into the world and when she had so said she went her way and called marry her sister secretly saying the master has come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and went unto Him amen and let's go to revelations chapter 3 and verses 20 to 22 or heed from actually let's read from verse 9 sorry 19 revelations 3 and 19 for as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as also I overcame and AM sit down it with my father and his he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this night I want to I want to kind of continue on and away from from Sunday but I want to speak about the day now in which we live and I trust that it'll be a blessing to you now when he read I just want to I just want to take a couple of just just background pieces from because we're going to move through the scripture a bit but we read in John as we as I spoke about on Sunday that there was the gathering of the Living Bride which is a representative Mary and Martha they were gathered to the son of man and when they were gathered to the son of man in the resurrection of the dead in Christ Lazarus happen so there's a gathering of the Living Bride and then the resurrection of the Dead Saints now we read in revelations 3 so basically what I'm going to show you now is brother Brown speaks of the bride age he says we're not a we're not a Pentecostal were not on the Pentecostal age anymore we're now in a bride age so I want to go and speak about what he's referring to so that's where I'm going to go if you're wondering where this is where this is going now so revelations 3 we read there that the that that God is commanding as many as he loves to be zealous therefore and repent and that's the only and if you read the whole chapter from verses 14 down to verse 22 speaks of the age we live in he doesn't give any good thing to say about this age it's all bad but then he says be zealous as many as I love be zealous therefore and repent but then he says now behold I stand at the door and knock so Christ is on the outside of his church so that so for the first time in two thousand years he has actually kicked out of the age so he is not in the church system anymore he's been kicked out so now but then he says If any man hear my voice so so there's a voice of God to this age which we know is the message of the hour God has spoken in this age of any man hear that voice any person hear that voice and open the door then I will come into him and and will sup with him and he with me we will have communion we will become one right so so there's a call for four he's on the outside and we're going to go into how that happened and then and then there's a call to for people to open the door and become one with Jesus Christ just like Mary Martha came to Mary and said you know behold the master cometh and calleth for thee so there's a call to come one with him there's a call to come out from wherever you are and become one with him right and to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sit down with my father and his throne so what happens now in this age that we live as this as this Christ has manifested upon the earth the Son of Man is revealed but the church system turns him down like they did in his first coming and so he's kicked out so now he's standing at door knocking trying to get back in calling that as bride will come out that's why these are called in this hour come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord is a call come out of her my people so so there has to be their call and there has to be a people that are predestinated to respond to that call I mean and and I I trust when I say that you said well that's me I mean he's called me out I've heard his voice I'll become one with him now when we talk about ages ago we talked about the Ephesians you know the seven churches I'll just define it in this way and age is defined as where God is working he was in the Ephesian age and then he moved into the next stage then he moved into the next stage he wasn't back in the first age anymore he had moved on so wherever God is that's the age where he is manifesting himself now so the world we know the lady I see in church age started with the word yo around 1906 with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Azusa Street and the letter C and H started but now there came a time so God was working there but then he became fully manifested in this hour the church system turned him down so he was kicked out they took Creed's and dogmas they took like Barabbas they received Barabbas at the first crucifixion and crucified Jesus just like the church world system takes a spirit of a murderer above the spirit of Christ and so so now he's kicked out so where's God dealing now he's not dealing in the church systems anymore but he's not dealing outside the church systems calling a bride so that's why so now the world is still in a later seeing condition right but the bride has called out into what brother brown referred to as a bride age right with a bride as call that and God is now dealing in the in his bride right so so even with me so far clothes right and we know that just like in any change in dispensation you know just like the Jews Jesus came to his own but his own received him not a few did but then you read the book of Acts it starts off with all Jews then there comes a time with Paul and Silas they said seeing you find yourself unworthy of eternal life we turn to the Gentiles see there's an overlap season where the Jews are slowly being blinded and the eyes of the Gentiles are being open so both Ages were overlapping one was phasing out and one was phasing in right and there's the same thing all the way down through the ages you see the Ephesian age slowly phases out the next h phases in just like with the latest in the Philadelphian age the age of brotherly love the great missionary age and the lady ascend age one one was overlapping in together later C an age was phasing in and the Philadelphian was phasing out right and then now we come down to here where the letter C at age God as God has been kicked out of that age which he has been and then now we started to opened up a bride age right so now God is now dealing in a bride age now brother Bram says I'm just going to make a I'm going to read this from the modern events made clear by prophecy he says but now there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again on a bride there cannot be any more church ages after this were at the end brothers and sisters we're here we've arrived thanks be to God Amen now we see these things that just as true as they can be sorry there isn't that's from the seed is not here with a shook now and modern the beans made clear by prophecy he says we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age the falling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture that's the age we're now living - my honest opinion that's exactly the truth now when brother baron when you when you go and listen to what he says you know when he speaks about now we're not back in the Lutheran Age or the or the Methodists age of the Pentecostal age he doesn't he doesn't do away with what happened in those ages God was moving in those ages God was calling his elect but he said it's a rebuilding of the of the second eighth so Jesus is the second Adam but he has to have a woman a church that now's the feminist part of himself so everything he is she becomes so he is the word she becomes the word right so you know we know on the day of Pentecost a church was birthed and you see a quick maturity a quick display the life of Christ and a group of people but it fell eventually decrees and dogmas of men so the sick and Eve fell there to the Creed's and dogmas of man till it was buried eventually in the dark ages but then it become to come back because God promised I will restore soon he sent Martin Luther with the Reformation and that opened up some of the light of the truth of the scripture but then that wasn't that was just the beginning it wasn't the end right so just like if you plant plant wheat or any kind of crop as soon as the little your leaf comes out you don't say well I've got my wheat it's got to grow it's got a mature it's going to become golden the seed that was planted has to be reproduced again right so so they're cast to come a process of time where the grain is here in the greenness here at the end there's not another church age after this right there's not a you know we're not looking for something to come it's already here all the power everything Jesus purchased for us bride at Calvary is loosed it's been put upon the earth we're not looking for another word to come we've received a full word rights and we know God does not take away he adds so he said Luther with justification the just shall live by faith when wisly came with the second work of grace sanctification he didn't do away with what Luther preached he preached justification and sanctification right then when the Pentecostals came they didn't do away with justification sanctification they believed in those things as well but then they also believed in the restoration of the gifts God was adding but then so so they believed in the baptism of the holy ghost and brother Branham says that they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make way for the person of Jesus Christ being counted in this church once again in his false right so it's not doing away just like when people you know many people they do not understand when brother Brown says well we're not living in a Pentecostal age then they begin to think well that you're saying that and you're doing away with everything in Pentecost no we're not doing away with what some Pentecost we still have it right we still have everything everything they had we have right everything lose the head was justification we have it but in a greater measure right sanctification as well because sanctification under Wesley was works that's why they called the Methodists they had a method of living a holy life but we don't have a method we have him in us makes us holy right his spirit and you sanctifies you cleanses you changes your affections what you love and not love whatever he changes you so you become holy right holiness is of the Lord hallelujah so it's his doing I mean so now so now we have those things we have the gifts right we have the supernatural power of God I mean we have all those things and we also know if you read through church history that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was for the believer down through the age but it was manifested in different ways but they received the Holy Ghost like we receive it right but the Methodists could only manifest that part of the plant right it wasn't the grain again it was the tassel right the grain had to come later on but they were manifesting what they called the manifest like the Lutheran's like the Pentecostals but now the grain is back again right we're not we're not part of the plant looking closer to the grain the green is here holiness to the life you see in the son of man as you see in Jesus Christ as now in the bride form hallelujah so now we have everything and also I want to say these things because if we deny what God has done in the past some people say well we're the original Pentecost no we've gone past Pentecost right but we don't do away with what Pentecost was because what people do is they say well we're the original Pentecost they had nothing and they actually get rid of the very ones that pave the way for the bride to be here because they do not know who they are in the scripture right so everything Pentecost was we have amen but the difference is we have the word the son of man has been revealed right so we don't have Christ and measure but in fullness not not just a part of him but all of him right the Lutheran's could only live a slice and just shall live by faith it's as high as they could live that was Christ working in them then the Methodists come with sanctification a little closer right to the book of Acts but that's as far as they could live and then the restoration of the gifts again closer to the book of Acts and many thought that was the full restoration but it was still not quite there but in the green came right how lujah so so if we are the grain if the grain is here then there's no plateau right there's no leveling off there's no just sitting back in learning a few more things now at the life of grows and expands we're call to grow into the very fullness of Jesus Christ I mean let's just let's just read that shall we in in I'm an ex ex ex chapter 4 so if I don't get through tonight well we're just pick it up Sunday because these things are very important we need to know we need to know we're living in a different age and that age has has blessings everything we need is in the son of man Jesus Christ right we are we're not living the world is in ladies here but we are not in lady osya and this has to be a personal revelation to you when you become one with Jesus Christ in the state Amen that's when you are called out that's why it's not a group we are not going in a rapture because we come to this place right Amen sure a church body works together God manifests himself through the body but you do not go in a rapture through association right you know you do not go and the rap is just because mommy and daddy know God or brother or sister you have to norm yourself that's the only way that you're gone to rapture is that you know Jesus Christ personally for yourself hallelujah I'm glad he's here to meet Lori now Acts chapter 4 oh sorry Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4 and let's start from verse 12 I know I'm just I've you know we've covered some of this before but I just want to lay a bit of a foundation here so it's it's for that because we're going to see where we're going and what we're becoming right because if we think we're some former age what we're going to go back but we're going forward we're going to know who where we are I mean for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so this is a speak about the fivefold ministry Allu you write till we all come in the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ till we all come to this image right till we grow into this right that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is which is the head even Christ from whom owed me the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love that's why it's very saying we're growing into the fullness of Christ we have to until we all come to this and this is to the perfect man that you're the you know many times in the scripture the word perfect means complete entire the full image right so we're growing into this amen and this is the age where it happens where we grow into the statue of the fullness of Christ individually right so this is the so in the Bride age this is where this takes place now we're just going to go through a quick I want to show you very quickly that there's been a is a change in dispensation where there's a reason Jesus is kicked out of the church age unless in church age now if we go to Matthew 21 we're just going to read it a bit of Scripture here Matthew 21 and this is the parable of the of the vineyard so Matthew 21 in verse 33 now it's very evident I know we could say when Jesus was here and he was hanging on Calvary the Lambs they offered at the temple did no good because they'd been a change right and so Matthew 21 and verse 33 hear another parable there's a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out the husbandmen and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to be husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the year come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the Lord therefore the vineyard cometh what will he do unto the husbandmen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons jesus said unto them have you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so Jesus actually saying to the scribes and Pharisees the kingdom is going to be taken from you and given to another because you're going to kill the son right and so now there is a change in dispensation from law to grace from law to grace as I said as soon as Jesus was hanging on Calvary the blood of bulls and goats didn't work anymore because as the Apostle Paul says the book of Hebrews there's now a new and living way hallelujah so there was a change going on and it's the same thing today where there's a change from grace to judgment but in the between time a bride is called out hallelujah now brother Bram sees this and in the indictment so you see in the scripture we've got a Jerusalem the church has it's in heaven heavenly Jerusalem we God as we God as God and today it's not under some creed or something that we try to make it a Jerusalem we'd like the Methodists would like to say to make the Methodists headquarters a Jerusalem the Catholic would like to make Rome in different places where we've had our headquarters they'd like to make it a Jerusalem but the Bible says our Jerusalem is from above which is the mother of all the believers now in Christ as God's provided lamb notice how appropriate it it was now staying that that Jerusalem was ceasing so the natural Jerusalem on the earth was ceasing when it was an effect until that hour so it worked until that hour that Jesus was there the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing that they had to do that's right so they had to crucify him they had to reject them and crucify him and the kingdom was taken from them and given to us I mean God will call the people who are not my people who weren't his people will now become the people of God where the kingdom was taking on the Jews now given to the Gentiles and that was when the Son of Man was manifested right Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man prophet so when he was there there was a change and it's the same thing now in this day where went from seven church ages of God allowing you know you know allowing denomination to work but then when the son of man was revealed Jesus Christ the word and they rejected him and crucified him then he then he left the systems and began working with his bride only amen now brother uh so jesus said now so the kingdom of God you say well the kingdom of God is not with observation or geographical location that's why you know when when when Jesus said if they say he's in the desert of a secret place he's not in a location but he is in the manifestation of his word right he's not in a geographical place he's in the manifestation of his word the kingdom of God does not come with observation as Jesus's and Luke 17 but the kingdom of God is within you the Holy Ghost amen and so now and then he says about as as the Lightning shine is from one part of part under heaven and shown it to the other part of heaven so shall it be also the son of man in his day so what you see with lightning you know whose watch for lightning go across the sky it doesn't start lightening and end up a goose I'm saying something ridiculous it starts lighting ends up lightening the same manifestation you see there is there right so the same interface nation of Jesus Christ and his first coming we saw in a second coming the same life that was on display there we saw here right that's the son of man in his day now gee if we went to the you know if we win and spoke to the scribes and Pharisees you know they would say they would they would of course speak against what God did in their day Paul said to King Agrippa that these things were not done in a corner they weren't hidden from him this is many years after Jesus had come in and died and resurrected he said I'm persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him speaking of King Agrippa for this was not done in a corner so he was speaking of the Ministry of Jesus Christ it wasn't done in a corner wasn't done in a hidden place or a secret place or a desert place it was done out and open right but the scribes and Pharisees however wanted it to be done in a corner they would have been happy it was done in a secret place but God doesn't do things like that he does it fall in front of everyone but the elect catch really what's going on right today and they warn their people not to go to the meetings we Jesus was because if they did if they went to his meetings they they would be kicked out of the synagogue they were told not to pay attention money was given to the soldiers that guarded the tomb in order that their testimony could could explain it away why it was trying to make the people forget right try to sweep the whole thing under the rug in order to use the argument no one knows about this this is a parallel they want to sweep the Ministry of brother branham the Son of Man Jesus Christ under the rug no one's heard of this this didn't really happen they explain it they try and explain it away right it didn't really happen as the disciples say go ask the soldiers that were at the tomb what would their testimony be his body was stolen the supernatural they claim was all fabricated made up these so-called followers they are just kingdom building trying to get you to follow some dead man how can you have confidence in what he said when one of his so-called disciples went against them and actually helped us arrest them this would be if we're asking Caiaphas about this whole Jesus thing right what does that tell you the character the moral integrity of these so-called apostles if one of them actually betrayed their very God they claim to be serving right and look at them ignorant and unlearned as they say they are prostitute Samaritans publicans and sinners don't you know that cults always target those who are the vulnerable of society amen don't that's what people say cults target vulnerable people who did Jesus go see the woman at the well vulnerable person Society Legion right ignorant fisherman that didn't know the scripture so cool what one of the church people went and joined his group not not many and look at the methods of look at the methods of Paul the Apostle Paul he went to the church he or he went to the synagogue see he debated with him he said I'm sick of us and he goes to the ones who don't really know he went he targeted the vulnerable of society that was the elect Amen cult sois don't you know coke cult toys target those who are vulnerable society 1st Corinthians 1 and 26 he says how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called so as the out cursor not many learned of great people are as followers where are those among us or as followers if he was really the Messiah wouldn't it have been us that he that would have recognized them look at Moses Moses went to the elders of Israel and told them who he was and what his commission was and they received him who's read that in the scripture and this and Moses said I mean this Jesus claimed that he was really the Prophet that Moses said would come like a nun to him so he would have done the same thing wouldn't he no he didn't do that did he yet not one of our great leaders such as the great holy noble High Priest received them but he was who he said he was I want you to think about these things because what happened in the first coming has happened again that's why I'm bringing these things in but really when you see these things happen it's cause is a dispensational change the reason they hated him was because he is bringing in a new age he was actually getting rid of and exposing their religious hypocrisy you go read Matthew 23 he pronounces seven woes on all of them where is the man from the Sermon on the Mount he was the still the same man who preached the Sermon on the Mount but now judgment was coming Allu yeah the reason I hated him was because of the new age was coming in and they had to be blinded in order for this to happen now let's go to you know it says in the book of Peter it's speaking about whom to whom coming as a living stone well let's let's go to I believe its first Peter - I don't have the yes first Peter - to whom coming first Peter - and for this had to happen to whom coming is unto a Livingstone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded and to you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them with which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they stumbled when the stone came the first time because he didn't come their way he didn't come according to what they expected it was the it they stumbled at his appearance and how he presented himself that's how he stumbled they called him in Matthew 11 a wine-bibber and a gluttonous man and the book of proverbs said be not among wine but a wine boobers among riotous eaters of the flesh so they attach this thing to him and they could have said look at season proverbs have nothing to do with this kind of fellow amen there was the there was the man who was that the was was at the Pool of Bethesda he was there for a very long time if one knows the story it was the Sabbath day Jesus came along healed him and told him to take up his bed and carry it away on the Sabbath day they told don't do any work on the Sabbath day de stumbled them and the Lord did these things because he was really proving what's in them would they really humble themselves to this man of Galilee which was their Messiah or would they rise up and say let's do away with this fellow and you know what happened he did away I mean they did it away with him it said now and they also used his words against them this is again happening in this day Matthew are so mark 14 and 58 every account of the of the trial of Jesus Christ they used the scripture Jesus said destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again and they use and they quote the very Messiah and they use it against them but they don't well let's just read one mark 14 and 58 we heard him say I will destroy this temple which is made with hands and within three days I build another temple made without hands see they heard what he said but didn't catch what he meant and they stumbled at it because they're looking through a natural mind looking through a carnal mind yeah this temples been here for a long time he said he's going to destroy it and then make one without hands in three days they didn't understand what he meant the thing is he didn't say no hold on can I have the Talking Stick can I be in the box witness box this is what I mean he didn't actually explain himself funny isn't it he could have proved them all wrong he could have explained it's hidden actually this is what I meant but he allowed the accusations to actually you know be heard he didn't even defend himself interesting isn't it when he could have but he just let them rail on him amen maybe we should think about that well I don't know why I didn't defend himself but he knew it had to happen now so there was a change there was a change in dispensation I'm sure we can all agree it went from a natural lamb to the lamb right so wheat from the natural blood of bulls and goats to us to to Jesus Christ the word being crucified and then now the old Jerusalem was done away with there was a change now we've come down to this time where where the same has happened again the denominational ages are done God is on the outside of his church and he's calling people to come unto Him now we're it there the cornerstone is a stumbling stone Jesus Christ is a stumbling stone and he still stumbles people his word stumbles people now brother Branham he he comes through his ministry and he begins to speak about the third pole about the three poles of his ministry quite early on it's in the mid mid mid 50s when he begins to speak about the third pole and I know time is running away but we'll try and run with it now and then he comes down he and he preaches a service called services this is time at the end oh is this the time of the insert so what's happened is just like Jesus ministry healing happened discernment happened but that wasn't the reason the reason was he was going to reveal who he was the word was going to open to the people that was the that was the purpose of the healing and the discernment is that now the word would come open just like Moses the signs and wonders were to gather the people that the word would come on Mount Sinai that was the purpose of his ministry and said our brother Branham God sends a spirit of Elijah upon the earth and the supernatural is done to get the attention of the people because God is going to open his word the mystery of God should be finished in this day and God has to put a profit upon the earth that his voice can speak and the mystery of God that Paul started will be completed in this thing hallelujah so now so this way the miracles took place post-world War two healing revival happened and historians attribute brother Browns ministry is spearheading it history history shows it was his ministry that did it change the face of America and then but the whole reason wasn't the healing it was now that the son of man Jesus Christ was going to be revealed that a people can have a true union with them with Jesus Christ the word not with a church so then he comes so so he comes down to so in 1962 we know in 63 the seals come open write the word comes open and then now and then he is he has a vision of angels and things coming and then he's there and he's wondering what it means because a prophet doesn't hasn't shown everything and he says after the spirit left me for about half an hour I guess I said Lord if it is then and I'm going to be killed and you're finished with me on earth I'm going to be taken home now if it is that that's fine that's alright so I said if it has let me know send your power back on me again then I'll know not to tell my people anyone about it because you're fixing to catch me away and nothing happened I waited a while then I said Lord Jesus if it does not mean that and it means that you've got something for me to do and it'll be revealed to me later then send your power he says and it almost took me from the room I found myself somewhere over in the corner I heard my wife somewhere trying to shake a door the door to the bedroom was locked and I had a Bible open and I was reading I don't know but it wasn't I believe Romans the ninth chapter the last verse behold I lay in Zion a cornerstone a stumbling stone a precious cornerstone and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed and I thought it strange I'd be reading that spirit still packing me in the room I closed up the Bible and stood there there when he's speaking about the cornerstone that's the capstone so the so the church that was built the Apostles built the foundation there the beginning stones of the building of Jesus Christ was laid there in the Ephesian age they had that there come a time when the capstone is put on the building where all of because we're all living stones we read write every believer through the ages are living stones and then we put in the building right but there comes a time when the capstone comes and the whole body of Christ has been completed so now what's happening is this command Junction and time where now the capstone is going to come to the body the head Jesus Christ is going to unite himself with his body upon the earth this is what he's talking about this monumental this incredible event that's going to take place where Christ His Word has been going to come fully in flow once again in people not just in one right not just in one there in the Gospels yo but now in his bride the word is going to put on flesh again hallelujah so now he's saying now this he's saying what does this all mean and God sends his power and if you go read Romans 9 well I don't know what kind of Bible he had a Scofield Bible but I'm sure any Bible if you go to Romans chapter 9 it doesn't look it doesn't look very nothing really jumps out at you does that I just want you to think about this but when he had it but his Bible was open and his eyes were directed to the end of the chapter God's telling him in the scripture this is what's happening there's a change happening where now I'm gonna come I'm going to come I'll be a stumbling stone but to the precious to the elect I'm going to be a precious stone because I'm the lord I'm their husband I'm coming to the wife I'm coming to find my bride hallelujah and so now here he is you know brother branham's in in in in Arizona and a sword comes into his hand he's in Sabino Canyon and a sword appears in his hand Amy and he says it fits his hand just right hallelujah it's just like Elijah's mental Elijah had to be changed to fit the mantle then I think when he put it on he would have felt that fits me just write that that sword represented the Word of God because he said 8yo because the sword was there he said he's always been afraid of a knife they said oh and then he heard a voice a king he thought it said a king's sword he said well do I go Knight people or you know give them ministries know the voice you know the Kings sword they said the only thing King there is is God and the sword is the word so now the word fit the prophet just right he had been molded for many years that now God could use a vessel to open up the word use a vessel to reveal himself in the scripture like never before John was gonna write the seven thunders he told write them not until the days of the voice of the seventh angel then they'll be known hallelujah so things that John saw but then right now we hear and we know what it is it's always been in there but now it's been revealed and when God releases his word he releases a power in that word hallelujah that's why we're not ordained to fall like the first thief this bride brother Graham says as the first Steve was actually ordained to fall the second Eva's ordained not to fall hallelujah that we are going to live a life to show we're not like the first Eve I mean we are built we are predestinated that we will not fall like she did but we will overcome Allu yeah they mention now so he received the sword of the king now in in the seventh seal brother Burnham relates this and before this I said I think I think it's a 1956 he speaks about the three pools of his ministry the first pull is the taking the people by the hand and seeing the disease the sick and Paul was the discernment and the third Paul was the opening of the word and he's looking to see when is this third Paul going to manifest and in the vision when he sees well well I'll just read this he says and then a voice shook down through there that rock the rock said it's the sword of the king and then I came out of it the sword of the king now if it said the sort of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one the king that's God and he has he has one sword that's his word what I've lived by that so help me God standing over his holy disc here with this holy word laying open it's the word Amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery in secret the third standing there when this left me something just came to me and said don't fear now I didn't hear no voice like I've inside me spoke I just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something had said don't fear this is the third Paul 3rd Paul you remember it he said you've had so many impersonations on this which is the gift in the hand and the discernment you know here there's a lot of impersonations on that he said you bet so many impersonations on the honest what have tried to explain he said don't even try this you remember how many remembers the vision well it's it's all over it's taped in everywhere it's been about six years seven years ago I've been seven years ago said don't try to explain it said this is the third pole but I'll meet you in there that's right amen he said he said I was standing with a little baby shoe and when he told me now make your first pull and when you do this the fish will run after the lower I said then what you're sick and pull because because it'll it'll be only be small fish he said the third pull will get it's big of the prize the bright is the prize hallelujah then the third pull will get it and all of their ministers got around me said brother Brennan we know you can do it hallelujah brother Brennan that's where I always get tied up with a bunch of preachers see I love people they want you to explain everything I see well I don't know I said I have understanding fishing now I said now the first thing you do here is is the way it's done you just see all all the fish around you got to jerk the loop jerk the lure that's exactly the tactics of fishing so I said jerk the lure now you see when I jerked the lure the first time now the fish takes out after it but there they were little ones and they were just and that's just like we were catching and then I said then you'll sit and I jerked it out on the bank and I had a fish but it looked like a skin over the lure it was he was so little and then I was standing there and something said I told you not to do that I started crying all the line was tangled around me like this and I was standing there crying with my head down I said oh God forgive me he said I'm a stupid person Lord forgive me and I had this line and that what I had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and I had the string and about a big around as my finger about half inch like an eyelid in the shoe and was just the size of 1/16 probably an inch in the island I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch cord and a voice it you can't teach Pentecostal baby supernatural things said now you let him alone and just then he picked me up and he took me up and set me up what set me way up high to a meeting was going on I looked and it looked like a tent or a cathedral or some sort and I looked and there was a little box little place over on the side I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see here in the picture world away from me like that and it went over that tendon said I'll meet you in there and said this will be the third pull and you won't tell it to nobody and in sabino canyon he said this is the third pull now brother Brown for the rest of his life after that vision was looking to buy a tent and have big tent meetings but just like the first two visions they weren't natural visions their supernatural visions but God was telling him this will not be a public show this third pull will not be a public thing it will be a private thing right and so what this is speaking of now this third pull is when God comes personally to you that secret meeting place amen he says I'll meet you in there he wasn't speaking just to the property is speaking to the bride I'll meet you in a secret meeting place hallelujah just like Sarah was in the tent and and God Elohim became flesh and and and revealed what you're singing her heart and then Isaac took Rebecca after they after they met and they went to that Tina became one who became a secret meeting place right where a husband and wife became one and it's the same thing in this day an hour where God has called a bride it's not a public show when God unites himself with us bride it's not out in public right but they become one you can't impersonate it you can't explain it when God reveals his word to you and you become a new creature in him you can't you can't put it in words how wonderful he becomes you how lives the word becomes to you I mean because it's not a it's not a public show the devil can impersonate any gift but he can't impersonate the word and he can impersonate the word becoming flesh hallelujah because it's a life that has now looked brother Brahim says and the rising of the Sun he says he was the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God as Christ and Christ as the seals that's been open does the opening of the seals in revealing Christ revealing Jesus Christ so many people see well I see a horse riders and I see a tribulation I see this and that but no you got to look again see it's Jesus Christ being made known I mean because that the sword that came into his hand he is then instructed go back to Jeffersonville and you'll be told what the seven seals are and you preach it to the people and it was revealing Christ so Christ now had become unveiled or unsealed enemy and there's now here in this age to become one with his bride hallelujah Amen so that's why he says I'll meet you in there I'll meet you in the secret place that's why when you read the Song of Solomon that secret place by the stairs hallelujah I'll meet you in that place amen so this is why this is why this bride age is so tremendous it's not another denominational age another just move of the Spirit this is the climax age this is the peak age where God Himself that's why that cloud is tremendous to me I mean that it looks like Hoffman's head of Christ the painting and now that's the head looking for the body he's looking down to the earth he's now hunting his body Here I am to find my body helliya he found me amen my lord found me hallelujah that's why it goes beyond doctrine right you know your your computer can quote you a lot better than you and in multiple languages the message in the Bible but it can produce the life right it's those that really become one with him they produced a life with a bridegroom I'm it's just like the Lambs wife has made herself ready in Revelations 19 I mean the wife is the only one that can legally produce the child right then look that is made in the image of the father the husband hallelujah this is part of where we are you go look into what brother Brown says about the bride age he he never speaks bad about the bride age right and you even go look at his ministry where he has a in the 50s he's praying and he sees a vision of a of of his Bible come open to Joshua chapter one and then he reads the first nine verses of Joshua one and he gets given a Joshua commissioned the church has come through the wilderness now it's got a cross Jordan it's got to come into its inheritance program when he speaks to the Pentecostal people he speaks about them in the wilderness he speaks about the church came out of Egypt but it's in the wilderness right but he says now here comes a time for for the church to cross Jordan and gone to its inheritance our inheritance is in Christ right you read Hebrews three and four Paul parallels the promised land with Christ the Son of man right so now it now we're living in an era where we don't live in the desert we don't live in the wilderness we don't live in Egypt I mean but there's a word that's come open that parts Jordan where you can cross over into every promise of God I mean where we are actually dwelling in our promised land which is the son of man which is this age and then we're not living in a Pentecostal age we've gone past a Pentecostal age hallelujah and you'll know you're in there I mean when he becomes a reality and in when his word this this goes beyond stories it becomes a living reality to you programs said the Bible became a new book when the seals open right because now he can see Jesus Christ in every scripture and the mystery of the brighter become manifested into people oh yeah that's why you say well this this is not a teaching there's got to be experienced right where it goes beyond a prophet that's problem people get caught up with the veil with the Prophet they they they never those who go beyond the sign and they go to the where the sign is pointing to and they become one with him they don't have a trouble with the Prophet anymore because they met the one you know they're met the one that the Prophet introduced hallelujah brother BAM said my ministry is to show that he is here right Jesus Christ is here hallelujah we're not waiting for him to come he's here right but the coming finishes with us meaning his body in the air right we're part with we're already in a rapturous Michael the master has come and he calleth for thee amen and I trust you've actually something then you moved and you've given your all your broken your alabaster box you've surrendered everything you got no will to turn back - doesn't matter what rejection you know we have to face rejection we have to face criticism and and whatever more you know if they call the master Beelzebub our Lord Jesus they call them Beelzebub how much will will they call the followers and there comes a time which there comes a time where Mercy's done and there's no more and it's just to the souls in prison that there's a preaching - I don't believe her in that day yet but they'll come a time so the doors open get in cross the Jordan well it's a muddy play it's a muddy river just jump in cross Jordan die to yourself cross the river it's glorious on the other side o lujah Oh pick it up more on Sunday but we're living in a different season I mean God bless you qui have some musicians please want you to go go look into what he sees he's a big change from 1962 to 1963 onward there's a change in his ministry there's a change in dispensation he says now he says now we're in a bride age he sees it at the end of 1965 and he wasn't he's not here amen anymore the reason is because he delivered the message like Moses go read the book of Joshua see how many times Joshua quotes Moses in God he says Moses quite a lot he didn't add to the message that Moses gave he took that same message and the people went into the land right so now we've received a message the same anointing that was on Moses win upon Joshua and they claim their land so now the same anointing that was on the Prophet is now upon a bride and we claim our land right everything we have need of us in Jesus Christ I mean our inheritance is in the Holy Ghost this is why it's so important I mean if the Amalekites have built up have you know have built a fortress on you enjoy tear down the fortress I mean if this you know you know if Jericho still there March around apply trumpet shout a jubilee hallelujah if your peace is gone go take the Philistines out don't need them Kemp on your lane hallelujah whatever it may be and don't just don't just put back well I've got this part no take it all amen you imagine you people who who who own property you wake up the next morning and these squatters have actually left over your back fence and they've built a tent and they're there around the campfire are you gonna put up with it would you say welcome oh this is how it has to be now no yeah you call the police and you watch them be arrested and carted off your land right and if those people are armed in the police are just bringing the under fender squad and if it gets any too crazy the SAS will turn up Yeah right same thing with God all the armies of heaven are with the bride get rid of the squatters don't put up with him take what belongs to you in the name of Jesus Christ I mean let's um let's sing that song for the Lord is marching on as armies Eva strongly stand shall we I mean we're do we're living in a bride age yeah [Music] for the
