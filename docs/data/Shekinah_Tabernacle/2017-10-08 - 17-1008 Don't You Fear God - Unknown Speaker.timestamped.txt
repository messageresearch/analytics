[33:58] you made the camera when we said we move
[34:00] on the kids were they and when we when
[34:02] we were singing the kids were singing
[34:04] and when we were doing stuff the kids
[34:05] were just man and I have to say the
[34:08] girls they they were when we had a saw
[34:10] you'll see it come up and the girls was
[34:12] just owning that man we had to get the
[34:14] boys in the game it was good it was good
[34:17] to see and and it was wonderful to spend
[34:20] time with you and get to know you
[34:21] and I pray that makes you would be the
[34:23] same and I would I would make it a very
[34:26] pray for your kids as well that will
[34:28] we'll keep on doing it till the day the
[34:30] Lord comes because it's it's a very very
[34:32] place of time that I had I felt ideas
[34:35] all the games now just to break the camp
[34:38] down quickly the way they said it was
[34:42] going to be horrible
[34:43] God said there was going to be amazing
[34:45] the day on the mountain we didn't have
[34:48] the wind blowing we didn't have a cloud
[34:50] in the sky it was perfect I mean they
[34:54] witnesses we drive up it's raining it's
[34:58] good and it's not looking too well for
[35:00] us it looks like it's gonna be they said
[35:02] it was gonna be a storm coming so well
[35:04] not a storm very hard rain coming
[35:05] through the next day it didn't happen
[35:07] God wanted this God will take care of us
[35:11] and it was he's well so I thank the Lord
[35:14] for giving us perfect weather we went up
[35:16] the mountain the kids the the first day
[35:18] when we got to the Friday we went up the
[35:20] mountain we had a bit of snow play on
[35:22] the mountain I had a wonderful time they
[35:25] then it within we got down to business
[35:26] we wind down the mountain again and we
[35:29] went to do tobogganing some serious
[35:31] tobogganing get very tired was awesome
[35:34] and then we had the Bible study the
[35:36] evening no I don't I don't want to speak
[35:38] too much about the Bible study because
[35:40] it was for the children and I think if
[35:42] it will come out if somebody speaks
[35:44] about it it will be great but just the
[35:46] thought was you're a fig tree don't
[35:50] forget it don't let anybody else tell
[35:53] you different
[35:54] you know what God made you and where God
[35:56] placed you is what God wants you and
[35:58] that's it don't let anybody convince you
[36:00] of it there's a reason you're here just
[36:03] as much as any other parent is here okay
[36:06] and then the food was we had the games
[36:09] night was brother Isaac and I hope
[36:12] you've got those things in there it was
[36:14] I was advising and then we had the base
[36:17] food thank you sister
[36:18] Christine it was good we had the lasagna
[36:20] the evening and we ended up a good day a
[36:22] full day we all were tired and we went
[36:24] to sleep and the next day we just played
[36:27] I think it was ultimately I still
[36:29] couldn't move my legs for a week it was
[36:31] amazing and it was fun to just
[36:32] fellowship with the kids and we had no
[36:34] plans but yet it was a wonderful day and
[36:37] and then the biggest thing that happened
[36:40] for me is we had fellowship around the
[36:42] world because the kids was in the right
[36:44] atmosphere they could actually speak
[36:46] about things that was in their heart and
[36:47] battles that was going on and and we had
[36:49] a Davey with no as well we had a couple
[36:51] of heated discussions like really good
[36:54] heated discussions around
[36:56] would and and to keep keep your your
[36:59] eyes on Jesus because there's a lot of
[37:02] voices speaking in and this time and
[37:04] it's hard to discern them if you're not
[37:06] in the word so there was a lot of things
[37:08] that we had one and one talks on and I
[37:09] know that that was that was strongholds
[37:11] being broken and if you didn't know you
[37:13] know now and and I pray that that next
[37:16] year's camp would be the same that the
[37:17] kids can come with questions and ask
[37:19] them and and that we can fellowship
[37:21] around the world it's very important
[37:23] that's what is full and then the Miche
[37:25] got sick on their Friday night after the
[37:28] big day apart the Saturday ya know
[37:33] what's the Friday and before the games
[37:35] we were gonna play games and Dmitry was
[37:37] really really not feeling well he was
[37:39] sick and I went down and I took some
[37:42] tablets and I wanted to give him some
[37:43] tablets and and it's just a bit of a
[37:45] taste amount it's quite for me it
[37:46] changed a lot of my thinking as well and
[37:49] I got to his bed and you know when
[37:50] somebody is dehydrated and and the staff
[37:53] a bit of sunstroke it takes a long while
[37:55] to get over it because you have to get
[37:56] nutrients back in your body and water to
[37:59] get over it and I went to him and I said
[38:01] how you feeling and he says he feels
[38:02] terrible you really feel so terrible and
[38:05] I said okay can I pray for you and says
[38:07] yes you can pray for me and I said do
[38:09] you want the tablet she says now we
[38:10] don't I don't drink tablets um we will
[38:13] take medicine but not not tablets I said
[38:14] okay it's fine then don't drink it but
[38:16] can at least pray for you
[38:17] he said please do we prayed together and
[38:20] animal the witness right here half an
[38:23] hour later he was sitting in between the
[38:25] children having fun
[38:27] normal normal his eyes were blood-red
[38:31] when I got they they were red you can
[38:34] see when somebody is not feeling like
[38:36] her not really in a good place and then
[38:38] he came back and he was there was
[38:39] nothing wrong nothing he joined in and
[38:42] he was playing this is witnesses that's
[38:44] God and because he took a simple step of
[38:47] faith and he said that that prayer would
[38:50] help him he go heal and that's God and
[38:53] he was working the whole weekend
[38:55] addicted and in it brings me to the last
[38:59] thing what do we as parents give our
[39:01] children because the the battles that we
[39:05] fighting out there is very real and they
[39:08] fighting it
[39:09] how can I explain it they finding it
[39:12] even with with a covering over the eye
[39:15] sometimes because we've got revelation
[39:18] and we walking in the Lord and we strong
[39:20] and we go forth but remember they they
[39:22] still young and they don't see the
[39:24] punches coming but what we feeding them
[39:27] as parents that is what they have to
[39:30] work on so if we feed them junk food and
[39:33] we feed them the world don't expect that
[39:35] they would would have faith to - and
[39:38] this is just my burden and I pray that
[39:39] you forgive me because it's just me but
[39:42] if we feed them junk food and we give
[39:44] them the world the only thing that they
[39:46] have is strength to handle the world and
[39:48] they'll fail because there's no
[39:50] substance in there we can't give them
[39:52] burgers and expect them to be strong
[39:55] they need vitamins they need minerals
[39:57] they need vegetables and it might not
[40:01] always be nice as a parent to withhold
[40:03] them from stuff but the battles that we
[40:05] fought this weekend when we were away
[40:07] was voices that comes from every
[40:10] direction and is from the friends and
[40:13] it's from Christianity's from from
[40:15] denominational Christians and it's from
[40:17] and it's from brothers and sisters and
[40:20] and and it's real battles and these
[40:22] brothers and sisters are telling this
[40:24] person that this it's right you can do
[40:27] it because they don't even know the
[40:28] truth and because it's so close to them
[40:30] they just accept it so the biggest thing
[40:34] I can after the week and ask you is what
[40:36] are we feeding our children if they ask
[40:38] for a piece of bread are you gonna give
[40:41] them a stone if they ask for a fish are
[40:44] you giving to give them a Serb that's
[40:45] happened they ask for more of the Lord
[40:49] you should we should just listen it
[40:51] broke my heart to hear how children can
[40:55] be deceived so easily so I pray that the
[40:59] Lord would help us after this week and I
[41:01] prayed even more that the Lord would
[41:03] help us to teach our kids what is right
[41:06] and what is wrong and if we say as
[41:09] parents it's wrong to stand on that
[41:11] regardless of what the world says our
[41:13] family our friends whatever if it's
[41:15] wrong we stand against it if it's not
[41:18] according to God's Word don't do it I
[41:21] encourage you because I've seen
[41:23] this weekend it's hard man they fighting
[41:27] real battles remember our battle when we
[41:30] were young wasn't as bad as now the
[41:33] internet and those things and Hollywood
[41:35] and music it's just out there and this
[41:39] weekend we had no Hollywood we had godly
[41:42] music and we had God's atmosphere and
[41:45] you could see the difference you know
[41:48] the atmosphere we have at Kemps that's
[41:51] the atmosphere that was there and it
[41:53] wasn't grownups making it it was them
[41:55] having the atmosphere they had love for
[41:57] it's 81 another their patience meekness
[42:01] gentleness kindness long-suffering there
[42:05] was nothing was camp atmosphere there
[42:08] was no grownups so they can have it say
[42:11] okay they can take more food that we
[42:13] think they can take they are ready for
[42:15] vegetables and you can give them that
[42:17] minerals so yeah I won't say anything
[42:21] more praise the Lord thank you for the
[42:23] weekend and brother beam once again
[42:25] thank you for making it possible and it
[42:26] opened a lot so much and in my first
[42:29] candidate to come up Joshy he wants to
[42:33] say something about the weekend as well
[42:46] good morning church so on earth on
[42:52] Friday morning we all went up to the
[42:55] mountain and first we went up the ski
[42:59] lift and then didn't we played a little
[43:04] bit and my favorite part was when my dad
[43:07] decided to build a snowman and then well
[43:11] brother month was tackling the snowman
[43:14] when my dad finished we were throwing
[43:18] snowballs at him and we took a slow-mo
[43:21] video of it and then we came back down
[43:25] the mountain had food and then we went
[43:28] to the toboggans and then we played
[43:32] there a little while and then we came
[43:35] went back to the village and then we had
[43:40] this Bible study and then after the
[43:46] Bible study we had food then we had the
[43:50] game night and then yeah that's all and
[44:01] the next one was Easter
[44:20] good morning all um yesterday I just
[44:24] want to thank the Lord for what he did
[44:25] on the ski trip for the youth firstly I
[44:29] just want to thank the Lord for
[44:30] personally revealing to me about the
[44:34] Bible study that brother mine held on
[44:36] Friday night he spoke clearly about how
[44:40] we should be fig trees and that we
[44:42] should be a fruitful Jesus Christ and I
[44:44] believe that I used to be the sincere
[44:47] fruits of the spirit it was just really
[44:51] clear to me that God does truly love our
[44:53] youth and yes the atmosphere was really
[44:57] nice the place we were at
[44:59] yes it just gave us the youth the
[45:02] opportunity to fellowship with one
[45:03] another and to know each other boy yes
[45:07] so I just really want to thank God for
[45:11] this wonderful experience and brother
[45:13] being and everyone who helped us and
[45:16] organized everything you send yes the
[45:20] parents especially here with us say god
[45:22] bless you
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:39] hello everybody so
[45:42] after the slow fire lightweight or
[45:44] sometimes like games first up was table
[45:46] tennis and brother Kuen keeps us
[45:47] entertained by breaking up heaps of
[45:49] table dears rules that never existed and
[45:52] then after that we played a row a bad
[45:55] game where you get a row event and you
[45:56] put it around your head because it has
[45:58] to go from here to your neck the house
[46:00] real hard for some people who had beards
[46:01] and then though played that other game
[46:05] was basically like tug-of-war but you
[46:06] know stopping over your head that made
[46:08] everybody look a little bit creepy and
[46:10] then after that we are playing a game
[46:13] similar to the last week in the stocking
[46:14] you put it on your forehead and you've
[46:17] got an apple on the other end you got to
[46:18] swing the Apple around doc over cups and
[46:20] some people race hurt themselves with be
[46:21] able and then last of all my personal
[46:25] favorite was our article the scaring
[46:27] game it was basically went there were
[46:28] some boxes lined up on the table and
[46:30] someone's got left up the box and you
[46:32] gotta guess what's in the box in the air
[46:34] several sounds easy until someone lifts
[46:36] up the box and these brother and once
[46:37] he'd stuffy up and screaming at you and
[46:39] generally the people on the receiving
[46:40] him was screaming as well so that's all
[46:43] he did on Friday night I just I just
[46:51] want to correct Davey there was one more

[55:25] of morning this morning but we've got
[55:26] brother Venus going to share some now
[55:29] from his Papa New Guinea truck you know
[55:41] that video is all on YouTube now I mean
[55:46] god bless you all
[55:47] as you got the PowerPoint there can you
[55:49] can you put it up
[55:52] yes I'm Papa New Guinea for just over a
[55:55] week
[55:55] I thought Bernie know where they would
[55:57] have been here but so this is the theme
[55:59] of the of the Convention was behold at
[56:02] midnight there's a cry made behold the
[56:04] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[56:06] and thy way I can drive this kind of so
[56:15] just a background of just a bit of a
[56:17] geography lesson so Papua New Guinea
[56:19] snore north of Australia Australia's
[56:21] down here Solomon Islands is along here
[56:23] so I went up to so where's where my
[56:26] parents used to be in in rebelle so this
[56:28] is where I went to three brothers three
[56:31] pastors from just west of kunde our here
[56:34] in the highlands region came to the
[56:35] meetings as well I have been there as
[56:39] well once so they came over and it was
[56:42] good by the a moss who was the pasture
[56:44] and rebell he he had it that it wasn't
[56:47] just me taking all the services and to
[56:49] me that was the major highlight was to
[56:51] see a people stand up under the
[56:55] anointing of this word and preach it not
[56:58] just not just parroting something
[57:00] they've heard from New Zealand or
[57:02] wherever but the same revelation
[57:05] we have they preacher with that same you
[57:07] know same anointing and it was it was
[57:10] incredible to see that because they had
[57:11] the Saints Vichy and rebell had suffered
[57:14] a lot of persecution 2010 I went over
[57:17] there and I baptized pasty Massey and 15
[57:20] other people the church came out of
[57:22] their denomination the Pentecostal
[57:23] denomination they embrace this message
[57:25] but because they were baptized name of
[57:28] Lord Jesus Christ the other church they
[57:30] came out of the great persecution past
[57:33] Dimas was banned from preaching for a
[57:34] year the couple whose whose choice to
[57:38] land us on the banned from going to
[57:39] church for a month a lot of and a lot of
[57:41] pressure from these other churches you
[57:43] know what he you're listening to a liar
[57:45] and this man's a false prophet and
[57:47] there's one man I am when I was EO 2010
[57:51] I preached in his church is part of this
[57:52] denomination they came out of and he was
[57:55] actually he was actually wanting to get
[57:57] baptized he passed him most of whom were
[57:59] very good friends and they any and pass
[58:03] Dimas you know do you believe this he
[58:04] said yes then they had a council meeting
[58:06] with all the other elders of the other
[58:07] churches because the denomination
[58:09] control these are always a committee in
[58:11] charge and then he turned against and he
[58:13] wrote letters against this message and
[58:16] he and he sent it around everywhere he
[58:18] was in his 30s I think of that he got a
[58:21] disease in his kidneys and he died and
[58:25] there was another another another pastor
[58:29] in the same denomination the last year
[58:32] stood up and started attacking this
[58:34] message and against the believers he was
[58:37] he he became paralyzed and he died this
[58:42] message that we believe is not doctrine
[58:44] it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself and
[58:47] so sometimes people just go into the
[58:50] world they continue against it other
[58:51] times God just takes them to show you're
[58:55] not against these people you're against
[58:56] God can you play this all the upside
[59:02] down ones of videos that comes right
[59:05] away so just a so this is basically
[59:07] where they live this is their house very
[59:10] third
[59:10] world they just got power in the village
[59:13] into last year
[59:16] let's hear so this is this is where we
[59:18] were there's only like a short video
[59:20] that saw one of the brothers modem there
[59:22] there's a brother got baptized this is
[59:25] the house that we stayed and they built
[59:27] this house just before we turned up and
[59:29] the pastors from the highlands they they
[59:32] they dedicated this house it's
[59:34] two-bedroom place they just to give you
[59:37] an idea this is not staying at a Hilton
[59:38] and preaching in some way you know this
[59:40] is third world but they have something
[59:43] we do not have they have a simple life
[59:45] they don't have all this clutter in this
[59:47] this thing and all this busyness and
[59:50] stuff and to me I think they're very
[59:52] blessed but they want what we have but I
[59:55] wish we had what they had we are blessed
[59:57] in this country but yet there's a curse
[59:59] worth worth civilization this is this is
[1:00:01] my room this is just to show you he says
[1:00:03] a couple of sleeping mats a third
[1:00:05] mattress couple clothes in a mosquito
[1:00:07] net I had great sleeps I was actually
[1:00:10] pretty comfortable oh yes that's where I
[1:00:13] was there's the next one as you know
[1:00:18] Jonah play
[1:00:24] at least a hundred people on Sunday and
[1:00:27] from the Monday
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:47] but a lot of people have been at
[1:00:49] nighttime if you saw as that as the shot
[1:00:53] was petting around there's some big
[1:00:54] speakers they had at nighttime or when
[1:00:56] it wasn't raining the speakers on this
[1:00:59] side were put outside just to blast into
[1:01:01] the jungle
[1:01:02] hallelujah hey give the winds a mighty
[1:01:04] voice and so so there are a lot of
[1:01:07] people not just in the back there's more
[1:01:09] people there than in the video sure but
[1:01:11] they'd be out and the bush just sitting
[1:01:13] there listening and pasty most
[1:01:16] translated for me so it was good because
[1:01:17] um so we had three three services a day
[1:01:20] we two in the morning we had one dinner
[1:01:24] break then another one I took those ones
[1:01:26] but it was basically unfortunate because
[1:01:28] you're translating or you're being
[1:01:29] translated you preach half half the
[1:01:32] amount and twice as much time because
[1:01:33] going to be translated and then the
[1:01:35] brothers took the evening services I
[1:01:37] took one of them but it was good it was
[1:01:40] just really a real blessing so this is
[1:01:42] this is one of the night services these
[1:01:45] are all the children hello children they
[1:01:49] would sit in the morning for about four
[1:01:51] hours no break didn't get up that's
[1:01:55] concrete floor with the tarpaulin for
[1:01:57] hours they would sit amen we we're soft
[1:02:02] they they would sit there literally for
[1:02:05] four hours and I'd listen to me
[1:02:06] and that would be listening and it's
[1:02:11] past emo so what would happen at night
[1:02:12] because the first first because yo
[1:02:15] behold the bridegroom cometh fast the
[1:02:17] moistures said hey the bridegroom's come
[1:02:19] you gotta go out to meet him go to boil
[1:02:21] the oil have you even baptized the right
[1:02:23] way have you given your life you know
[1:02:25] just straight up are you ready
[1:02:27] we're at the end and so huh by that time
[1:02:31] half the children were asleep so as the
[1:02:35] altar call is being made
[1:02:36] there's our sisters would come drag the
[1:02:38] asleep children to the back to to make
[1:02:41] some room because from where I was
[1:02:43] standing here by one of the so the first
[1:02:45] night it was about twelve people came
[1:02:47] and in twenty then about thirty I think
[1:02:50] about maybe 40 by by Saturday night and
[1:02:52] I was standing here and that was full of
[1:02:55] people just full of people just coming
[1:02:56] and they were crying on God they're
[1:02:58] sincere they wanted to down
[1:03:01] to make sure they're ready yeah just say
[1:03:03] yeah we're saying now saying the
[1:03:05] tribulation is coming you don't want to
[1:03:06] go into that place big play heavy Amy
[1:03:09] come up which is the tribulation is
[1:03:11] going to come are you ready the
[1:03:14] bridegroom is coming where he's come go
[1:03:16] out to meet him so it was a tremendous
[1:03:19] time and uh here's pastor Nikolas he's
[1:03:23] preaching on the seven seals Church ages
[1:03:26] this brothers from the Highlands they
[1:03:29] had elections in July this is the kind
[1:03:32] of country does that elections in July
[1:03:34] national elections he's in charge he's
[1:03:37] head over to cleanse within the tribe

[1:03:40] it's quite a few people he told us
[1:03:42] people this election don't vote we voted
[1:03:44] for Jesus Christ we're not going to vote
[1:03:45] this election he just felt it and then
[1:03:48] what happened as the results the
[1:03:49] election came in and there were two MPs
[1:03:51] said they won the they won the district

[1:03:56] fighting people got killed but because
[1:03:59] his himself and his people didn't vote

[1:04:05] wreck I was at his place a few years ago

[1:04:09] one night during the surface I didn't
[1:04:11] hear it but opposed he or did you hear
[1:04:12] that gunshot no I didn't and they you
[1:04:15] know they you know we don't hear about
[1:04:17] what goes up in this place and if we did
[1:04:20] our newspapers would be full and you'd
[1:04:22] be shocked by the death and the killing
[1:04:24] and the hardship and the droughts and
[1:04:26] the famine and the starvation and the
[1:04:28] sickness and that's just life for them
[1:04:32] yeah yeah once upon time he led his
[1:04:36] people into war then then he got shot by
[1:04:40] the police threw a leg he said he was
[1:04:41] going to start a tribal fight and he
[1:04:43] wanted to start it started the fight

[1:05:03] and a thing this is it this is how they
[1:05:05] live
[1:05:06] we had a toastie maker as well because
[1:05:07] they just got power so we had ox and
[1:05:09] palm beef and onion toasties they're
[1:05:11] very good
[1:05:13] I'm sorry so and what they decided to do
[1:05:16] is they so for the Saturday they decided
[1:05:18] let's go have an open-air campaign at
[1:05:20] the market and rebell so they packed up
[1:05:23] all that sound equipment load it in one
[1:05:25] in a truck and they went to the market
[1:05:27] place on its own can you play that one
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:44] market on Saturday and then she died
[1:05:46] probably 2000 people and the vast
[1:05:48] majority here in that come forward and
[1:05:55] stand here in the front to listen but
[1:05:57] because it was so loud they could just
[1:05:58] stand and listen and there were people
[1:06:01] standing and there were listening and
[1:06:04] this is the first time this has been
[1:06:06] done here in rebel open-air campaign
[1:06:08] because the hand they were a
[1:06:09] persecuted they were but they've stood
[1:06:11] up and this isn't even before I thought
[1:06:13] there wasn't much you know those days
[1:06:15] they said no this is the word this is
[1:06:17] the truth this is Jesus Christ I mean so
[1:06:20] this is this was groundbreaking because
[1:06:23] this place is full of religion Catholics
[1:06:26] everything every denomination honor the
[1:06:28] sons their you know she's a lot of lot
[1:06:30] of religion it's a place of bloodshed as
[1:06:32] well the Japanese had the headquarters
[1:06:35] and rebell here during World War two
[1:06:36] Admiral Yamamoto had his headquarters
[1:06:38] for the Pacific Theater in this place so
[1:06:40] there's been a lot of bloodshed a lot of
[1:06:42] conflict over a religion but God's bride
[1:06:45] is standing I mean now let's just can we
[1:06:48] play this one as well this one this is
[1:06:50] massive
[1:06:52] and he's asking the question do you know
[1:06:54] what time you're alive you know what
[1:06:57] your message is do you know where you
[1:06:58] are in the Bible
[1:07:01] do you know what age you're you're
[1:07:04] Europe and people were listening the
[1:07:13] market manager after they finished they
[1:07:15] said you must come back again I've never
[1:07:17] heard this before you must come back
[1:07:19] again
[1:07:19] so I just thinking well you should do
[1:07:21] what you're told so they've got an open
[1:07:24] door invitation those people actually
[1:07:26] want to know there's people out there
[1:07:28] there's a lot of a policies like in the
[1:07:30] book of Acts they just don't know up
[1:07:43] there it was a real unity of spirit like
[1:07:55] we're one flesh beautiful is so amazing
[1:07:57] to see harmony you know not trying to
[1:08:03] emphasize this very strongly this
[1:08:05] message there's not a white man message
[1:08:07] that it's not an American message this
[1:08:10] is mission from heaven I mean I saw it
[1:08:12] preached and about you know two
[1:08:15] languages past the emos would be
[1:08:16] preaching you know Justin Justin pigeon
[1:08:19] then he'd gone to his local language
[1:08:20] this well what capitis is is at least
[1:08:22] 800 languages in Papua New Guinea
[1:08:24] language is not dialects languages but
[1:08:28] to see him stand there preach it in his
[1:08:29] own language but with real authority and
[1:08:31] real you know real anointing of Oz just
[1:08:34] just made my life so now we come to the
[1:08:40] point where he says people come to the
[1:08:42] front they want to give their lives
[1:08:44] someone to get baptized and Sunday
[1:08:46] morning we had Sunday nights no Saturday
[1:08:50] Saturday night there was one person that
[1:08:52] gave their name forward and then Sunday
[1:08:54] morning before service 20 and then by
[1:08:57] the end of the morning service on
[1:08:58] Saturday there was 28 and there was a
[1:09:02] few others who wanted to get baptized as
[1:09:04] well but they couldn't make it to the
[1:09:05] baptism
[1:09:05] so he hired this vehicle we packed
[1:09:08] everyone in like sardines this is this
[1:09:09] is public transport over there and most
[1:09:14] of these ones that got baptized are
[1:09:16] actually from a Methodist Church and two
[1:09:18] weeks before the meeting say yeah this
[1:09:19] is youth and two weeks before the means
[1:09:21] I start having prayer meetings and
[1:09:23] calling upon God and I think those would
[1:09:26] eat calling to the deep you should have
[1:09:27] you should hear these people pray
[1:09:29] they're not quiet you know in those
[1:09:30] services and everyone prays you can't
[1:09:32] hear yourself think
[1:09:33] and I'm just praying there God take
[1:09:35] control bind every religious spirit you
[1:09:38] know don't need anything else have
[1:09:39] preeminence in this place break the
[1:09:41] chains yeah I'm praying
[1:09:42] because I don't know what they're
[1:09:43] praying about I don't know what spirits
[1:09:45] on them because they're from any church
[1:09:46] Under the Sun yeah there's people there
[1:09:48] you know there's Pentecostal church they
[1:09:50] came out of miracles sure this healing
[1:09:53] sure but they they won't even be
[1:09:54] baptized in them Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:09:56] the prophecies you don't even need a
[1:09:58] revelation for that you just read the
[1:10:00] scripture but they won't even accept
[1:10:02] this word well that's not God's Spirit
[1:10:04] that's a demon power so these things
[1:10:08] these things you're to fight against
[1:10:09] that's the same thing here but it's more
[1:10:11] prevalent they're you know Hollywood and
[1:10:13] lukewarm living is probably the battle
[1:10:15] here more it's still the battle there as
[1:10:17] well yeah so praise the Lord there was
[1:10:20] it was amazing so let's just go the next
[1:10:22] one okay let's play this this is just
[1:10:24] thee no this is this is a good road in
[1:10:27] Papua New Guinea but I want to show this
[1:10:29] because now you can't really see it but
[1:10:30] so that's most of the people are getting
[1:10:32] baptized so that you we just saw that's
[1:10:34] that you were three on the back now
[1:10:36] we're so sorry so we're behind them and
[1:10:38] you look at those back tires you think
[1:10:40] they're gonna burst how are we going to
[1:10:42] get to where to get a baptized and and
[1:10:44] the driver was worried driving down he's
[1:10:48] like well I think you know I thought the
[1:10:50] Lord was too heavy the same amount of
[1:10:52] people come back on the same vehicle and
[1:10:54] he and his testimony is it's like I had
[1:10:57] an empty load driving back and he's not
[1:10:59] even a Christian at all yes that's so
[1:11:01] that's the typical Road
[1:11:04] I'm the Brethren from the highlands
[1:11:06] their their plane was come in their boat
[1:11:09] so there's only one ship that services
[1:11:11] the New Guinea islands and when we're
[1:11:14] there we found out it's in dry dock and
[1:11:16] Madang on the mainland it's going to be
[1:11:18] there for a month
[1:11:19] because the yes oh so they're all
[1:11:21] worried how they're going to get home
[1:11:22] they have to get home so we so we bought
[1:11:25] them plane tickets to get home so they
[1:11:27] flew to lay and then they had to get up
[1:11:29] you're the main highway up to the
[1:11:31] Highlands and ask them well how long
[1:11:33] does that take and past Nikolas said
[1:11:35] well depends you know if the bus drivers
[1:11:38] tired we just pull over and sleep and
[1:11:40] then we can we start the next day so it
[1:11:43] could take a few days and he said you
[1:11:45] know sometimes these holdups but if they
[1:11:47] don't have high-powered weapons we fight
[1:11:49] them but but if they do we give up he
[1:11:52] says but it's never happened to me
[1:11:53] that's what he said but you know that's
[1:11:55] um so here's some of them so here's the
[1:11:57] people with the baptism site here's the
[1:11:58] people who were getting baptized very
[1:12:02] sincere and tears very sincere one of
[1:12:05] the other brothers brother model before
[1:12:09] they went to the water he spoke to them
[1:12:10] and said are you ready you know do you
[1:12:13] want to give your life a listen and all
[1:12:14] the world yes and determined and yes I
[1:12:16] want to I want to serve the Lord and it
[1:12:18] was wonderful to see here so here's
[1:12:21] here's one of the shots and here's
[1:12:22] pastor he must pass to Nikolas baptizing
[1:12:24] I thought it was good I said I said you
[1:12:26] baptized them because I said I'm just a
[1:12:29] tourist I come and go you know but this
[1:12:31] is your work the people because the
[1:12:33] people have to see it's not about the
[1:12:35] visiting minister they have to
[1:12:37] acknowledge the gifts in their own mitts
[1:12:38] and in their own country because they
[1:12:40] they have to rise up to their position
[1:12:43] but if but a visiting ministry always
[1:12:45] comes always look to them and they don't
[1:12:47] and they belittle the gift that's in
[1:12:48] their own country and I feel many times
[1:12:50] the gifts in their own country are far
[1:12:52] greater than the ones that you know the
[1:12:53] visit just just speaking of my own self
[1:12:55] and see anyway so here's so this lady so
[1:12:58] so watching the baptisms and she so she
[1:13:00] takes takes people from the beach out to
[1:13:03] hear pastor Nicholas pasty Massa
[1:13:04] baptizing and I'm thinking what's going
[1:13:07] on here and I asked them out after the
[1:13:09] end she is actually one of the adult
[1:13:11] youth leaders in the Methodist Church
[1:13:14] she doesn't get baptized but she's
[1:13:17] helping her people get to the baptism
[1:13:19] effect so i said god bless her i don't
[1:13:21] know what her name is but lord i say god
[1:13:23] bless that woman you think that's quite
[1:13:26] strange but hey God God works in
[1:13:28] mysterious ways
[1:13:28] now now here's a burden I wanted a place
[1:13:30] I know meet you
[1:13:32] this so this is not a curved building is
[1:13:34] just a Pam Eric photograph there's a
[1:13:35] three story department building this is
[1:13:38] this is the capital of the province East
[1:13:40] New Britain so this is a basically a
[1:13:42] harvey norman and a supermarket all
[1:13:44] meshed into one now you can buy plenty
[1:13:48] of dictionaries these are all
[1:13:50] dictionaries you can buy heaps of
[1:13:51] dictionaries there you can buy any
[1:13:54] assortment of statues of Jesus or Mary
[1:13:58] glow-in-the-dark crucifix dongle on the
[1:14:00] dock this is your choice I'm not saying
[1:14:03] this as a joke I want you to really
[1:14:04] think about this this is the Bible
[1:14:07] selection most of these are Catholic
[1:14:10] prayer books we have a English English
[1:14:14] standard version Bible or a good news
[1:14:17] Bible both of those translations are no
[1:14:21] good this is this is the biggest store
[1:14:24] in the province and this is it here I
[1:14:27] put the Spanish infant booty no earlier
[1:14:29] but anyway so King James Version for
[1:14:31] there are three that bear record in
[1:14:32] heaven the father the word and the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost these three are one and there are
[1:14:35] three that bear witness in earth the
[1:14:36] spirit and the water and the blood these
[1:14:38] three agree in one English standard
[1:14:40] version for there are three that testify
[1:14:41] the spirit and the blood water and the
[1:14:44] blood and these three agree this is the
[1:14:49] Bible they can get and it's no good we
[1:14:54] have access to the word I'm so thankful
[1:14:58] we do now this is this is a serum sister
[1:15:03] Sarah and this is modeled as severe so
[1:15:05] their marriage so this is the so they
[1:15:08] own the place with the churches they got
[1:15:10] baptized years ago she is so happy at
[1:15:15] the end of the services just crime she
[1:15:17] said God has shaken this place she's so
[1:15:22] happy to see people you know cuz they're
[1:15:24] like because I asked you these people in
[1:15:26] the message they need to get into the
[1:15:28] message that yo this is true yeah
[1:15:29] these people have sold out they believe
[1:15:32] this is the Lord Jesus Christ they're
[1:15:33] fully persuaded hallelujah and the
[1:15:37] husband madam
[1:15:39] yeah they are these people are oil tea
[1:15:42] I'm showing you these photos because
[1:15:43] we're going to see you
[1:15:45] meet these people one day it's either
[1:15:47] going there or in heaven you'll meet so
[1:15:49] pray for these people because they have
[1:15:50] a tremendous burden for their community
[1:15:52] they have a tremendous burden for thee
[1:15:54] for the work there's 7 million people
[1:15:56] that they know of and Papua New Guinea
[1:15:58] it's very hard to travel nationally
[1:16:00] there's not interconnecting roads like
[1:16:02] we do
[1:16:03] barely tar sealed on a good day the
[1:16:06] potholes have potholes
[1:16:07] you know the plains are very expensive
[1:16:10] the shipping doesn't work anymore so
[1:16:12] it's it's quite a it's quite a big
[1:16:15] country but God will find his own this
[1:16:18] is this is past
[1:16:19] a mosque this is his wife metalita now
[1:16:22] this is the firstborn Emma this is the
[1:16:24] youngest Lydia I can't remember their
[1:16:27] middle child's name and I don't and this
[1:16:29] is a girl that I think just just lives
[1:16:31] with him so this is pasty moss and he's
[1:16:36] on fire Hey and he knows and whom he has
[1:16:39] believed and so she and it's tremendous
[1:16:43] you pray for these people whatever you
[1:16:45] do because if we're not in our place
[1:16:48] within order in their place we can't go
[1:16:50] home we're stuck here and you know it
[1:16:54] goes both ways so this side is not a
[1:16:56] good photos past Amasya this is past the
[1:16:58] necklace so these brothers are from chim
[1:17:01] businesses this is a brother John and
[1:17:03] pastor Anton these brothers are from
[1:17:06] Jimbo and they they have and they're and
[1:17:09] they're wonderful mean and they know in
[1:17:11] whom they have believed they preached
[1:17:12] this word with everything within them
[1:17:14] and even and they have a real burden too
[1:17:17] to see the word spread and yes oh so we
[1:17:22] got them plane tickets to go home
[1:17:23] because I real upset how we're gonna get
[1:17:25] home we have to get home and so it's a
[1:17:27] week so we help them out they this is
[1:17:30] this is brother Boniface this is the
[1:17:31] first man I baptized in Papua New Guinea
[1:17:34] back in 2009 I believe it was but he
[1:17:37] doesn't come up to fellowship here he
[1:17:39] needs fellowship but he's he's got a he
[1:17:42] has a gifted man and he's a real
[1:17:43] blessing so pray for me he said it so
[1:17:45] his wife didn't come to the services he
[1:17:47] only came for the weekend but it but he
[1:17:49] said to me you know my wife wants to get
[1:17:50] baptized now so there's a stirring going
[1:17:52] on so God's elect will respond and this
[1:17:57] is Ruth
[1:17:58] oh that's that's me that's Ruth she is
[1:18:00] the first this is my parents house maid
[1:18:03] that started it all back in 2008 I
[1:18:06] prayed Lord how can I share this with
[1:18:07] people I don't even understand their
[1:18:09] language
[1:18:09] I only speak a little bit but a pidgin
[1:18:11] and the Lord said very clearly tell her
[1:18:14] your testimony when she comes to work
[1:18:16] tell her your testimony show the deep
[1:18:18] calls that they've been explained the
[1:18:19] ministry from scripture and God
[1:18:20] supernaturally got ahold of her and she
[1:18:22] started to be a witness and she
[1:18:23] witnessed to to the people up in toto
[1:18:26] Vail we passed a mosses that's how the
[1:18:28] missus got there and that's how they
[1:18:29] embraced it so but pray for her if she
[1:18:32] doesn't go to fellowship and she's kind
[1:18:34] of leaning back towards her old
[1:18:36] denomination you know there's a call
[1:18:39] come out of who my people be not
[1:18:40] partakers of her sins and we don't want
[1:18:43] to we don't want to humanly just say
[1:18:45] it's all right sure people may stay that
[1:18:47] they may get saved but I don't want
[1:18:49] anyone to go into the Great Tribulation
[1:18:50] I don't want anyone to stand before the
[1:18:52] great white throne judgment because the
[1:18:53] great white throne judgment is not
[1:18:55] really we think our mercy will be given
[1:18:57] to some it will but the God that's full
[1:18:59] of mercy and grace today standing before
[1:19:01] you will be a god of Wrath and judgment
[1:19:02] in that day and he's not a respecter of
[1:19:05] persons so they must come out they must
[1:19:09] come out oh this is the video from the
[1:19:13] baptism is that the ending
[1:19:20] we were there for a good few hours
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:32] well this thing about they think I'm
[1:19:35] looking at the Jesus base here singing
[1:19:46] is Solomon he's still in the
[1:19:49] denomination that passed him off from
[1:19:50] the church came out of but because they
[1:19:52] have such good influence with the people
[1:19:54] you know they got all the musicians from
[1:19:56] the church that used to be against them
[1:19:57] and and they wanted them there in the
[1:19:59] meetings to God to grip them because you
[1:20:02] are they fight against the Baptist and
[1:20:04] all these things you know you can say
[1:20:05] yeah I showed them in the word Howard
[1:20:08] his name will be called Prince of Peace
[1:20:10] the mighty God the everlasting father
[1:20:12] you know Emmanuel all these different
[1:20:14] things but then why the Angels say
[1:20:15] caller's name Jesus and Jehovah Jireh
[1:20:18] and you're all the all the names of the
[1:20:20] Old Testament are in Jesus Christ you
[1:20:21] know so why wouldn't you take on the
[1:20:24] name of the one who redeemed you and
[1:20:26] yeah
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:36] go here drive she's calling on God
[1:20:41] most of them work I wouldn't just dry
[1:20:43] out condition you know these people are
[1:20:46] like Lord off I want and don't leave me
[1:20:49] behind the way that was very good we we
[1:21:00] go into the rainy season it rained when
[1:21:03] I first attack and then when we needed
[1:21:09] to go down to the market for the open
[1:21:11] air it just started raining yeah it only
[1:21:17] rain yes a night like in the middle of
[1:21:20] night some people could walk to the
[1:21:21] services not in the rain people could
[1:21:23] sit outside not in the rain God
[1:21:28] undertook in a lot of ways but
[1:21:30] supernaturally was the bride is on this
[1:21:33] plane Papua New Guinea and it was the
[1:21:36] mighty Isis brothers the success of
[1:21:38] these beings is not me it's not because
[1:21:40] I'm here it's because you the Lord has
[1:21:43] taken you under using you in this place
[1:21:44] and that's what I want to say I said I'm
[1:21:47] just here to visit that is you have
[1:21:49] taken this and for once a somewhat a
[1:21:52] group was downtrodden and there was fear
[1:21:55] and all kinds of things now they're on
[1:21:56] their feet and now it's the enemies on
[1:21:58] the run I thought either chase them down
[1:22:01] kill us kill him
[1:22:03] don't just watch them flee pursue
[1:22:07] hallelujah so God bless you all thank
[1:22:09] you for everyone who pays Tyson and give
[1:22:11] to the church because without you I
[1:22:12] could never go and it was a trimming it
[1:22:15] was the best time I've ever been up
[1:22:17] there so the work is expanding so keep
[1:22:20] them in prayer yeah okay brother Isaac
[1:22:24] I'll pass back home to you god bless you
[1:22:26] all
[1:22:32] as a little oK we've got the item
[1:22:36] special from Rebecca and I think Easter
[1:22:40] and then we just saw a worship song
[1:22:42] after that and then rather pinkie
[1:22:43] minister
[1:23:28] god bless you so they're going to sing
[1:23:32] play through a duet of the national
[1:23:34] anthem
[1:23:35] and I don't know if all of you
[1:23:38] foreigners that have migrated here know
[1:23:40] our national anthem but it's a powerful
[1:23:42] prayer it's probably the most Christian
[1:23:44] anthem in the world and we've probably
[1:23:47] only ever heard the first two verses at
[1:23:48] a rugby game but actually you'll hear
[1:23:51] because we'll sing as a congregation
[1:23:52] after they do they do it this just stand
[1:23:54] and we'll sing and just you'll see the
[1:23:56] words and you'll see how powerful the
[1:23:58] prayer is and just pray it as you sing
[1:24:00] it because you know as both Isaac was
[1:24:03] saying we have a we have a Goshen you
[1:24:06] could say on an actual perspective where
[1:24:08] we can we've got a country we can
[1:24:10] worship garden you know and we've got
[1:24:12] freedom of religion still and we want to
[1:24:14] maintain that we want to keep that we
[1:24:16] want God to defend it amen
[1:24:18] and so let's just pray that with their
[1:24:20] hearts as we sing you really bicker

[1:38:06] and then we're gonna go look 23 thank

[1:38:35] not rest until the righteous this there
[1:38:37] of go forth as brightness and her
[1:38:39] salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth
[1:38:41] and the Gentiles shall see thy
[1:38:43] righteousness and all Kings thy glory
[1:38:46] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[1:38:48] which the mouth of the Lord shall name
[1:38:50] thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
[1:38:53] the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem
[1:38:55] in the hand of thy God thou shall no
[1:38:58] more be termed forsaken neither shall
[1:39:00] thy land anymore be termed desolate but
[1:39:04] thou shalt be called hip-hip Sabah and
[1:39:08] I'll and Beulah for the Lord delighteth
[1:39:11] in thee and thy land shall be married
[1:39:13] for as a young man marries a virgin so
[1:39:16] shall thy sons marry thee and as the
[1:39:18] bridegroom rejoices over the bride so
[1:39:21] shall thy God rejoice over thee
[1:39:25] hallelujah and let's go to let's go to
[1:39:28] Luke chapter 23
[1:39:42] and we'll read verses 38 to 43
[1:39:57] and it says here and superscription also
[1:40:00] was written over him and leaders of
[1:40:02] Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the
[1:40:04] King of the Jews and one of the male
[1:40:06] factors which were hanged railed on him
[1:40:09] saying if thou be Christ save thyself
[1:40:11] and us but the other answering rebuked
[1:40:14] him saying does not thou feed God seeing
[1:40:17] thou art in the same condemnation and we
[1:40:20] indeed justly for we receive the due
[1:40:22] reward of our deeds but this man has
[1:40:25] done nothing amiss and he said unto
[1:40:27] Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest
[1:40:30] into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him
[1:40:33] verily I say unto thee today thou shalt
[1:40:36] be with me in paradise Amen may the Lord
[1:40:39] bless his word this morning you may have
[1:40:41] your seats now we just read two very
[1:40:47] contrasting scriptures one of one of
[1:40:52] where God is saying that the bride you
[1:40:55] know that national anthem is thinking it
[1:40:56] should be God defend the bride God
[1:40:59] defend yo this land this word that we
[1:41:01] have you know I you know I was very
[1:41:03] blessed by that but you know it should
[1:41:04] be more than just more than a country's
[1:41:06] national anthem I think as brother nd
[1:41:07] said but you see we have a such a
[1:41:09] contrast in these scriptures where one
[1:41:11] is saying that the Lord will you know
[1:41:13] delight and delight in thee as a
[1:41:15] bridegroom rejoices over a bride of a
[1:41:17] freshness of a love of a union coming at
[1:41:19] the place and then we read a scripture
[1:41:21] where there's two thieves hanging on a
[1:41:23] cross and they and one is railing on him
[1:41:26] you know if you're really God if you're
[1:41:27] really true if you're really what you
[1:41:29] claim to be saved me and you just do it
[1:41:31] you know what kind of attitude that is
[1:41:34] and then the other one says does thou
[1:41:35] not fear God seeing that thou art thou
[1:41:38] art in the same condemnation now the now
[1:41:41] the two hanging on the cross they saw
[1:41:44] Jesus at the last kind of manifestation
[1:41:46] of his earthly journey yeah because he
[1:41:49] would die but when he resurrected he was
[1:41:51] in a different form than just a natural
[1:41:52] body and so we are living we are
[1:41:56] basically the thief thieves on the cross
[1:41:58] I mean we're at the end we weren't here
[1:42:01] when when when the Son of man first
[1:42:03] arose and there was the healing ministry
[1:42:04] the first pull the second pull yeah
[1:42:06] we're living in the time of the third
[1:42:08] pull but we're right at the end where
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] door to Mercy is being shut yeah and God
[1:42:13] was closing a door to the Jews in the
[1:42:15] state where the where the lamb sacrifice
[1:42:18] of the temple yo before this happened it
[1:42:21] was fine but after it happened it was
[1:42:23] not fine
[1:42:24] because his access to Mercy was changing
[1:42:26] and he was closing a door to a people
[1:42:28] and he was and so I wonder if I could
[1:42:31] entitle this something I'd say don't you
[1:42:34] fear God
[1:42:35] there should be you know we maybe it's
[1:42:38] my fault but sometimes we lean too much
[1:42:40] on the love mercy and grace but we
[1:42:43] should have a real godly fear you know
[1:42:46] because God God it says in Romans 2 11
[1:42:50] it says for there is not a respective
[1:42:52] persons with God he doesn't he doesn't
[1:42:54] have any respect you know if it's if
[1:42:57] it's one of us bride
[1:42:58] you know the wise virginal the foolish
[1:43:00] virgin or or or those in the Beast
[1:43:02] system he doesn't have any respective
[1:43:04] person hey yo he doesn't have any
[1:43:07] respected person he holds everyone
[1:43:09] accountable to the same thing which is
[1:43:11] his word I mean he does not he shall not
[1:43:14] wink at our ignorance ow
[1:43:16] our professed ignorance you know
[1:43:18] unfortunately we know too much
[1:43:20] we've been it's been yeah this word
[1:43:23] himself in this hour has been known to
[1:43:25] us too much I mean that he could just
[1:43:28] wink on our ignorance and and we can
[1:43:29] scrape in does there not fear God we
[1:43:36] must be careful we must be very careful
[1:43:41] where that we you know these are saying
[1:43:45] that brother Bram users yeah this is
[1:43:46] saying where man will walk with hobnail
[1:43:49] choose where angels fear to tried so
[1:43:52] I'll just wait on like nothing there's
[1:43:54] no danger there's no worry and they just
[1:43:57] wade on through because jesus loves me
[1:43:59] this I know for the Bible tells me so
[1:44:02] but what is your response to that love
[1:44:03] what is your response like you know he
[1:44:06] said in Isaiah 62 as a bridegroom
[1:44:08] rejoices over a bride shall sow thy god
[1:44:11] be with thee so now what should out be
[1:44:13] our response be to the scars where he's
[1:44:15] now now purchase your salvation I've
[1:44:18] lifted you up I've called you out of
[1:44:19] darkness County out of her my people be
[1:44:22] not my taker
[1:44:23] place there's been a call come and we
[1:44:25] responded to this call and he's
[1:44:27] rejoicing here's my bride I'm gonna
[1:44:30] unite myself with her
[1:44:31] hallelujah our love can be manifested
[1:44:33] we're gonna really become one I mean
[1:44:36] like a new love our first love
[1:44:38] hallelujah you know you know in the in
[1:44:41] the Eastern culture the bride groom took
[1:44:43] care of everything he called the guests
[1:44:45] he furnished the wedding
[1:44:47] he did everything so imagine now you've
[1:44:49] been planning now I've got been planning
[1:44:51] for many thousands of years before there
[1:44:53] was time he was planning it in his mind
[1:44:56] hallelujah how the ceremony is going to
[1:44:58] go and how he's going to send the
[1:45:00] invitations and how they're going to be
[1:45:02] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:45:03] the Rice's of saints and the food we get
[1:45:06] to enjoy the banqueting table he's going
[1:45:08] to layout and the decor and you know all
[1:45:10] the he's been planning it and then
[1:45:13] finally he sees that become manifest
[1:45:15] hallelujah all the planning all the
[1:45:17] detail I'm God is a God of detail oh I
[1:45:20] want to be like that I mean so now he
[1:45:22] begins to see it all being laid out and
[1:45:24] he sees the guests arrive hallelujah he
[1:45:27] sees us he sees his bride is now right
[1:45:30] in the wedding garment then he picked
[1:45:32] out and here she comes
[1:45:34] don't you think you'd be he'd be excited
[1:45:36] don't you think of that is just a
[1:45:38] natural bridegroom who remembers the
[1:45:40] wonderful day when you got married and
[1:45:41] the summer six now the day it arrived
[1:45:44] maybe enough was the morning feels the
[1:45:46] afternoon for us and it was like a
[1:45:48] you're waiting and you're waiting even
[1:45:51] though it's just a few hours under such
[1:45:53] expectation you've gone through the
[1:45:55] rehearsal but this is more than the
[1:45:56] rehearsal I mean you've you've promised
[1:45:58] everything you are to your spouse but
[1:46:01] now here's the official ceremony you
[1:46:03] know even though that unites you know
[1:46:05] your value nights you but here they so
[1:46:09] you remember that time and then you're
[1:46:10] standing there at thee you know foot of
[1:46:12] the stairs or whatever in the church and
[1:46:14] then the music begins to play and then
[1:46:17] and then the bride and the bridesmaids
[1:46:19] come on or whoever comes in but the one
[1:46:21] you're looking for to come here she
[1:46:23] comes
[1:46:24] why should God and then now you see here
[1:46:27] walking up then you get real nervous
[1:46:28] because you're excited and you had your
[1:46:30] heart's full of love and you don't know
[1:46:32] what's what you're gonna do you in terms
[1:46:34] of you gonna start crying you're gonna
[1:46:36] you know I was standing there and my
[1:46:39] knees begin to shake I thought I hope
[1:46:41] this is not up but I'm so happy because
[1:46:44] the day had arrived amen and then it
[1:46:47] seems all over so very quickly but
[1:46:49] that's just the it's a yo but doesn't in
[1:46:53] there it gets more wonderful and more
[1:46:55] glorious and you love them more and you
[1:46:57] appreciate them more and you enjoy them
[1:46:59] more hallelujah now if that's just a
[1:47:02] natural wedding how much more God
[1:47:04] thousands of years in the planning and
[1:47:06] here we are what should our response be
[1:47:09] to that what should our response here's
[1:47:13] the bridegroom oh my love I'm so happy
[1:47:14] with Mary we're 1 hallelujah I'm sorry
[1:47:17] it's a it's a joy to wear to show that

[1:47:29] taking place and what if she just like
[1:47:30] yeah yeah good ahead better desert you
[1:47:36] know didn't really like it
[1:47:37] what kind of response now would be I'm
[1:47:40] not saying that as a joke but just think
[1:47:42] about it because this is how a lot of
[1:47:43] people respond to God this is their
[1:47:46] attitude now it's not convenient for me
[1:47:48] I want to do it my way I'm gonna I wanna
[1:47:50] I have things I have to deal with know
[1:47:52] that is actually just a defense of
[1:47:55] actually I don't want to surrender
[1:47:56] that's all it is oh I've got to deal
[1:47:59] with a few things though let God deal
[1:48:01] with it and it's from when you fully
[1:48:03] surrender to him that's when he deals
[1:48:05] with it Amy but if you're holding a bit
[1:48:08] of yourself back how can he fully take
[1:48:09] you and use you and mold you over I mean
[1:48:13] that's how that's how people's attitudes
[1:48:14] are now I'll do it later it's not
[1:48:18] convenient for me yes you put out this
[1:48:21] big spread you see it ministry you seen
[1:48:24] the lives of the Prophet you yourself
[1:48:26] have revealed yourself through your word
[1:48:28] in this hour you have / vindicated
[1:48:30] yourself God you've proven yourself
[1:48:32] alive and well you've shown this is more
[1:48:34] than a storybook you know you come down
[1:48:36] service after service or just listening
[1:48:38] to a tape or hearing song or and prayer
[1:48:40] you come down with us all the time
[1:48:41] let sure you do those things but not now
[1:48:45] it's not convenient for me
[1:48:49] what kind of the choo-choo we have how
[1:48:53] good is our God how great it is his word
[1:48:56] hallelujah had tremendous Izzy hey so
[1:49:00] good to us I don't just want you get
[1:49:02] excited you to really think about how
[1:49:04] good is he that the winning go off
[1:49:06] without a hitch
[1:49:07] yes did he free from darkness yes did he
[1:49:11] call you out was there something in here
[1:49:13] that said that's my Lord speaking and
[1:49:16] you responded you began to walk
[1:49:18] hallelujah did he do all these things
[1:49:20] did he purchase your Redemption and then
[1:49:24] we look at it and say well maybe another
[1:49:27] time God is not a respecter of persons
[1:49:31] doesn't matter all we say well I'm the
[1:49:33] Bride of Christ well God will actually
[1:49:35] hold you more accountable amen he
[1:49:38] actually hold you more accountable he's
[1:49:42] not a respecter of persons he respects
[1:49:45] us he so he treats everyone the same
[1:49:47] everyone exactly a level playing field
[1:49:52] the rich young ruler came to Jesus and
[1:49:56] Mark chapter 10 and he was a man now he
[1:50:01] was a man he was a good young person it
[1:50:05] could be any age it doesn't really
[1:50:06] matter you know for us but he saw that
[1:50:09] Jesus had something that is that his
[1:50:11] teachers and his churches did not have
[1:50:13] so he ran to and mark 10 and 17 and he
[1:50:18] and when he was gone forth into the
[1:50:20] wastes this is Jesus now there came one
[1:50:22] running and kneeled to him and asked him
[1:50:26] good master what shall I do that I may
[1:50:28] inherit eternal life said so when he was
[1:50:31] in the way this man came running
[1:50:33] he wasn't dragged he came running what
[1:50:35] shall I do what shall I do that I may
[1:50:38] inherit eternal life and Jesus said why
[1:50:40] course thou me good for there is none
[1:50:42] good but one that is God but they lost
[1:50:46] the commandments do not commit adultery
[1:50:48] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[1:50:49] false witness defraud honor honor thy
[1:50:52] father and mother and he said any
[1:50:54] answered and said unto master all these
[1:50:56] have I observed from my youth now this
[1:50:59] is the very God God in flesh knows all
[1:51:01] things
[1:51:02] he didn't deny that this is in mark 10
[1:51:05] and 21 then Jesus beholding him loved
[1:51:07] him so Jesus loved them the love of God
[1:51:11] doesn't keep people out of destruction
[1:51:13] the love of God does not because it says
[1:51:15] that Jesus when he saw him this is a
[1:51:18] good young man this man has got
[1:51:19] qualities he's a devout man he's a
[1:51:22] sincere man you know he's not just
[1:51:25] floating along with the tide he wants to
[1:51:27] know and he's come to me he's got good
[1:51:29] qualities the things that he that no
[1:51:31] doubt he wanted to see manifested any
[1:51:34] any young people under the law this is
[1:51:36] what he's singing this man so he loved
[1:51:39] them and he said one thing thou lackest
[1:51:44] go thy way sell whatsoever thou has to
[1:51:47] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:51:48] treasure in heaven and come and take up
[1:51:52] the cross and follow me and he was sad
[1:51:54] at that saying and went away grieved for
[1:51:56] he had great possessions now this man
[1:52:00] needed a revelation and he received his
[1:52:02] revelation revelation doesn't always
[1:52:05] make us happy it doesn't always make us
[1:52:07] say yes I'll do it
[1:52:08] amen but the final thing that you've got
[1:52:11] to die to that's when you got to see
[1:52:13] you're gonna hold on to your own world
[1:52:16] only those who have surrendered their
[1:52:18] entire will to God will be in heaven
[1:52:21] those who keep their will will not be in
[1:52:23] heaven yet they become a prisoner and so
[1:52:28] he needed a revelation what can I do to
[1:52:31] inherit eternal life and Jesus gave him
[1:52:34] that revelation I'm going to tell you
[1:52:36] what you need to do sell oh you have
[1:52:37] give it to the poor and you have
[1:52:39] treasure in heaven take up your cross
[1:52:40] and follow me
[1:52:41] you must be willing to bear their
[1:52:44] approach but it wasn't willing to do it
[1:52:48] he and he countered his natural life and
[1:52:54] the things he had understanding in the
[1:52:57] community and all those different things
[1:52:59] greater greater things than being in
[1:53:01] heaven you say well that's crazy well
[1:53:05] people are still doing the same thing
[1:53:07] today don't you fear God well at another
[1:53:09] time I can do it at another time is more
[1:53:11] convenient but there comes a time when
[1:53:14] there's no other time
[1:53:17] rather Bram said so people say well I
[1:53:20] need a revelation on the word it's in
[1:53:22] here if you sincerely pray it will be
[1:53:25] here and you won't go anywhere till you
[1:53:27] come back to that spot and God's on the
[1:53:30] obligated tip on once whether we like it
[1:53:33] or not you know we have it so good
[1:53:35] sometimes we can just just keep plowing
[1:53:38] over God's mercy and there's a line is a
[1:53:41] line between mercy and judgment and if
[1:53:44] we cross his word we don't get to choose
[1:53:46] our own judgment
[1:53:47] we don't you know if we if we step over
[1:53:51] the boundary of his word you can't
[1:53:53] choose you know David was David was
[1:53:56] smart actually God did give him a choice
[1:53:58] but he said Lord whatever's best you
[1:54:00] judge me and and there's a plague and
[1:54:03] killed a whole bunch of people but we
[1:54:05] don't really keep the choose just have
[1:54:07] you step over the boundary well it
[1:54:08] doesn't matter you know it doesn't
[1:54:09] matter if I go against his word he still
[1:54:11] loves me no he'll make you pay do you
[1:54:15] want to pay those wages you want to
[1:54:17] suffer that I mean I just want you to
[1:54:21] think about this thing do you want to
[1:54:22] suffer those things because it says in
[1:54:26] Hebrews 12 and 14 it says follow peace
[1:54:29] with all men and holiness without which
[1:54:30] no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:54:32] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:54:34] grace of God least any root of
[1:54:36] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:54:37] whereby many be defiled he's talking to
[1:54:40] believers he's talking to believers with
[1:54:42] us this is we are not exempt from
[1:54:43] anything we have the same battles that
[1:54:46] they have in the world whether we like
[1:54:48] it or not we have the same enemy comes
[1:54:50] against them comes against us but the
[1:54:52] real believer that separate themselves
[1:54:54] to God has an overcoming power and it's
[1:54:57] not a legalistic way of being separated
[1:54:59] it's being separated and heart
[1:55:01] I mean being separated and hard as how
[1:55:03] you separate to him you know there came
[1:55:05] a time when when there's a restoration
[1:55:08] there was near Myron Ezra and they had
[1:55:10] to separate out from the priesthood all
[1:55:12] those who had mixed themselves with the
[1:55:13] races of the world around them they had
[1:55:16] to separate those people out you say
[1:55:18] well that's pretty harsh you know they
[1:55:21] couldn't change what they did but we can
[1:55:22] get a new birth this morning we can be
[1:55:25] how nature can be changed everything the
[1:55:27] devil is mixed into us
[1:55:28] can be separated out of us he did and
[1:55:31] then Ezra so astonished he hears that
[1:55:36] the people married with people around
[1:55:38] them the heathen nations and he's
[1:55:40] astonished and he sits the Flex Somers
[1:55:43] Somers beard out I think and he and he
[1:55:47] sits there astonished she's so shocked
[1:55:49] what the people have done with the holy
[1:55:50] seed it says in the Bible that's the
[1:55:52] same thing we can be we should be so you
[1:55:54] know people don't blush anymore
[1:55:57] people aren't shocked by anything
[1:55:58] anymore program sees in one place that
[1:56:01] blushes actually if you do it's actually
[1:56:03] it's a defense he sees because we should
[1:56:05] be we shouldn't be so numbed to sin we
[1:56:09] shouldn't be numb to iniquity we
[1:56:11] shouldn't be numb to the effects of
[1:56:12] darkness oh that's just what happens no
[1:56:15] we can't just accept it and say well no
[1:56:17] we should be shocked by it we should be
[1:56:20] we should be upset yes I mean we should
[1:56:23] be upset when people are those do things
[1:56:26] that are know that aren't right not
[1:56:28] against them but God they're living
[1:56:29] below their privilege they're living
[1:56:31] below what God has ordained them to be
[1:56:33] God set them free from that darkness
[1:56:36] because it says he'll seal those that
[1:56:40] that sign cry for the abominations done
[1:56:43] in the city I meant you know you know I
[1:56:45] think it's an easy kill here's the man
[1:56:47] that had an income and he sealed those
[1:56:49] on their foreheads gave them the Holy
[1:56:50] Ghost
[1:56:51] those that sighed and cried for the
[1:56:52] abominations down in the city and this
[1:56:54] was before those came with the
[1:56:56] slaughtering weapons to kill everyone
[1:56:57] the destruction and the city the city
[1:57:01] that we should sign craft the
[1:57:02] abominations done in is this city yeah
[1:57:06] we can't condemn those out there they're
[1:57:09] in darkness they are lost to begin with
[1:57:11] you gets like your brother has his about
[1:57:13] a pig you can't tell a pig come out of
[1:57:15] the mud get dressed and you've got to
[1:57:16] live a better life by nature he's a pig
[1:57:18] you can't help him he's going to get a
[1:57:20] new nature at him and then he can live
[1:57:23] then he can live a different kind of
[1:57:24] life but now those who have started for
[1:57:27] the kingdom never sinned send his
[1:57:29] unbelief and they condemn brother Graham
[1:57:33] says they condemned already out there
[1:57:34] because they either believe not i
[1:57:36] condemned already the scripture tells us
[1:57:38] so you can't condemn them all that
[1:57:40] trouble that's trouble
[1:57:41] it's horrible but you've got to start
[1:57:43] they've gotta start on their walk be
[1:57:46] with me and so now it's not they it's
[1:57:49] not that necessarily we should just saw
[1:57:50] him cry forward but we should but we
[1:57:52] should sign crafts the abomination is
[1:57:54] done within the city of the believers
[1:57:56] hey with me not to put people down you
[1:58:00] understand that you shouldn't just be
[1:58:02] numb because people who just wait on and
[1:58:04] sit and unbelief we can just continue on
[1:58:18] continue and continue on he'll come to a
[1:58:20] time just like the days of Noah I'm done
[1:58:24] I've tried to persuade them I've sent my
[1:58:28] word I am my word I've said can be
[1:58:31] united to me they won't come I see it
[1:58:46] the invitation it's done you say but I'm
[1:58:50] in the message that doesn't mean too
[1:58:52] much you don't we don't get into heaven
[1:58:54] by association you don't come into you
[1:58:58] you don't come you're not gonna be in a
[1:58:59] rapture because you come to this place I
[1:59:01] mean or we're any other churches around
[1:59:04] the world that's not a ticket to the
[1:59:06] rapture I took it to the raptures
[1:59:08] because you've received a new birth and
[1:59:10] a real one it produces the real fruits
[1:59:12] of the spirit and not a pride and
[1:59:14] arrogancy lifting yourself up above
[1:59:16] others isn't that right and our
[1:59:20] religious spirit will exalt itself and
[1:59:23] it will proclaim itself brother Bram
[1:59:27] never proclaimed himself he never
[1:59:29] advertised himself cuz it was real
[1:59:32] humility real humble spirit II head and
[1:59:35] that was god-given but God will not
[1:59:37] always strive with man he says and so
[1:59:42] this is back in Hebrews 12 and 16 he
[1:59:45] says so he speaks about the root of
[1:59:46] bitterness
[1:59:47] it says lest there be any fornicator or
[1:59:50] profane person as Esau who for one
[1:59:54] morsel of meat
[1:59:55] sold his birthright for ye know that
[1:59:57] afterwards when he would have had
[1:59:59] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[2:00:02] for he found no place of repentance
[2:00:05] though he sought it carefully with tears
[2:00:07] so Paula sang do not be like him he was
[2:00:14] he was entitled to the birthright he was
[2:00:17] entitled by his birth
[2:00:19] I couldn't receive this birthright but
[2:00:21] he took a natural thing and he put that
[2:00:24] at a higher esteem just some food and we
[2:00:27] can take well our lifestyle and how we
[2:00:29] dress and what we do you know if the
[2:00:32] things we do our country to the
[2:00:34] scripture and makes you do things which
[2:00:36] are not according to this which is
[2:00:38] ungodly things I would I'd find
[2:00:41] something else to do I would seriously
[2:00:43] find something else to do but God
[2:00:45] overlooks that God is loved but he's
[2:00:47] also God of wrath yes and a God of
[2:00:49] judgment and God is not a respecter of
[2:00:51] persons you know God is not an old
[2:00:54] doting granddad which just spoils as
[2:00:56] kids you can do what you want that's
[2:00:58] what Israel thought he was will never be
[2:01:01] taken in to bad blood well now we can do
[2:01:03] yo we're God's chosen people we're in
[2:01:06] the inheritance they were but they did
[2:01:09] not fear the Lord they they took it for
[2:01:12] granted who they were by the associate
[2:01:15] our living all we're in the message we
[2:01:18] believe this message we believe God's in
[2:01:20] a prophet God can't take us you know God
[2:01:23] can't take us out of this place
[2:01:24] don't take it for granted he say while
[2:01:29] you're leaning one way pretty hard I I
[2:01:31] maybe I don't think I am because because
[2:01:35] there is a there's a flip side to
[2:01:36] fearing the Lord and that flip side I'll
[2:01:40] come to later okay
[2:01:44] brother BAM sees in leadership 1965
[2:01:48] speaking of the rich young ruler life
[2:01:51] though he had achieved this young fellow
[2:01:53] he had achieved all good things in
[2:01:55] school being fine as a good boy no doubt
[2:01:58] he'd been good as a real father and
[2:02:00] listening to his daddy in business he
[2:02:01] had been a good boy good to his parents
[2:02:03] he'd been loyal to his priest
[2:02:05] he'd been loyal to his church had been
[2:02:07] loyal to the commandments of God
[2:02:08] but he lost the greatest thing and the
[2:02:11] rest of them didn't mean very much to
[2:02:12] him when he turned down the leadership
[2:02:15] of eternal life Jesus Christ
[2:02:17] buh-bam said he turned down eternal life
[2:02:20] the leadership of eternal life
[2:02:24] notice this leadership confronts every
[2:02:26] one of us today the same thing as it did
[2:02:30] that young men no matter how religious
[2:02:32] we are you may be Catholic Baptist
[2:02:34] Methodist or maybe Pentecostal or
[2:02:36] whatever you are this same thing
[2:02:38] confronts you tonight I'll say this
[2:02:39] morning eternal life
[2:02:41] that's acceptance of Jesus Christ we're
[2:02:43] given this opportunity he turned down
[2:02:46] eternal life and the last and the next
[2:02:49] part brother Graham links the two
[2:02:50] parables together there's a rich man and
[2:02:52] a bigger called Nazareth and they both
[2:02:54] die
[2:02:54] the rich man goes to hell Lazarus the
[2:02:56] big goes up into Abraham's bosom and
[2:02:58] brother bad links the two parables
[2:03:00] together where he turned down now I
[2:03:03] don't believe this this rich young ruler
[2:03:04] became an atheist he would have ploughed
[2:03:08] on I'll give more I'll serve more I'll
[2:03:11] do more but doing more serving more
[2:03:16] giving more without the leadership of
[2:03:18] eternal life doesn't do you all that
[2:03:20] much right it doesn't do you all that
[2:03:23] much we don't want to be like Esau Esau
[2:03:29] sold out he didn't hold dear what he had
[2:03:34] he took it for granted we don't want to
[2:03:38] stand in jeopardy like that amen
[2:03:41] we don't want to take it for granted you
[2:03:43] say well why don't I have you say but
[2:03:45] but God has done great things for me God
[2:03:47] thing did did great things for Balaam
[2:03:50] anointed of many times and he
[2:03:51] prophesized God did great things for
[2:03:53] many people who have just been anointed
[2:03:55] but just because someone's anointed
[2:03:57] doesn't mean they they go to heaven
[2:03:59] jesus said many will come to me in that
[2:04:02] day saying Lord Lord have I not done
[2:04:03] many mighty things
[2:04:04] now what's this person doing he's
[2:04:06] actually actually making an appeal
[2:04:08] they're standing in a judgment Lord have
[2:04:12] I not done things for you have a not
[2:04:13] cast out Devils in your name though many
[2:04:15] mighty works preached in your name lifts
[2:04:18] for you in my day and hour and he and he
[2:04:20] doesn't deny they see is the
[2:04:22] for me either worked iniquity either
[2:04:24] work I never knew you so these were
[2:04:27] religious people these are religious
[2:04:29] people God uses them benefit gifted
[2:04:31] people hallelujah Amen but they were
[2:04:36] workers of iniquity see God is not a
[2:04:38] respecter of persons he doesn't take yes
[2:04:40] you preached in my name you did miracles
[2:04:42] you proclaimed my name therefore I'll
[2:04:43] let you in know I see it's not you were
[2:04:45] a work of iniquity I can't let you in
[2:04:47] God is not a respecter of persons and
[2:04:50] there were people upon the earth that
[2:04:52] will fulfill that scripture there are
[2:04:55] whether we like it or not because God is
[2:04:57] not a respecter of persons so why would
[2:05:00] we sell our birthright for such a small
[2:05:03] thing well what will my family think of
[2:05:06] me what will my you know you know the
[2:05:08] people who do the same hobby or sport I
[2:05:10] do what will they think well my family
[2:05:12] think what will these people think who
[2:05:13] cares what they think
[2:05:15] who's going to lead you into heaven as
[2:05:17] it Jones at the golf club or wherever is
[2:05:20] it you know or is it God himself
[2:05:23] who's gonna let he's not gonna be
[2:05:25] standing there so who's your God who's
[2:05:30] your God is it is it this not just part
[2:05:34] of it we don't want to live now you say
[2:05:38] it's very easy to bash the nomination
[2:05:40] I'm not talking about them it's very
[2:05:43] easy for people they may say they
[2:05:46] believe it but in reality they've taken
[2:05:47] twink and they'll begin to twink out
[2:05:49] versus now that's that's old-fashioned
[2:05:53] to live a wholly separate life to God no
[2:05:57] you mean I have to quit wearing this and
[2:05:59] doing this and saying this twink it out
[2:06:01] doesn't matter that's what people do
[2:06:03] I wouldn't you think about this we don't
[2:06:05] want to be caught with a twink toute
[2:06:07] Bible because anyone like that hasn't
[2:06:10] been fully converted yet because if the
[2:06:13] same God at the same spirit dwells in
[2:06:15] you and wrote this word you'll say yes
[2:06:18] something I say yes that's true yes
[2:06:21] that's your word God yes I believe that
[2:06:23] truth because you can't deny it
[2:06:25] if the same one how can an author how
[2:06:28] can an author reject his own work an
[2:06:32] author cannot they say yes that's my
[2:06:34] handiwork
[2:06:35] so how so how much more now if this is a
[2:06:38] perfect word which it is how can God say
[2:06:40] no that that doesn't apply for today oh
[2:06:42] that's wrong with no that's not right
[2:06:44] but people act that way but God is not a
[2:06:46] respecter of persons season Hebrews 13
[2:06:51] in 13 let us go therefore unto him
[2:06:53] without the camp bearing his reproach we
[2:06:56] don't want to stand our own camp you
[2:07:00] know your lifestyle your culture your
[2:07:05] society your comfort zone you go beyond
[2:07:08] those things you have to be carrying you
[2:07:10] got to be willing to carry his reproach
[2:07:12] Jesus and every age has always had her
[2:07:15] approach you know it's not been oh just
[2:07:18] a sweet easy ride for the believers
[2:07:19] there now suddenly harder than this day
[2:07:21] they had they had it hot in every day
[2:07:23] you go back into the real me status age
[2:07:26] which John Weasley was there he had he
[2:07:28] got kicked out of the churches isn't
[2:07:30] here to preach open em it was a reproach
[2:07:32] to be a Methodist in that day it was our
[2:07:34] approach to be a real Lutheran in the
[2:07:36] Lutheran Day it was that elzar approach
[2:07:38] to be a disciple in Jesus's day yes I
[2:07:41] made it every every age down through it
[2:07:43] was her approach but the question was
[2:07:45] are you willing to bear his reproach are
[2:07:48] you willing to say yes Lord I'll carry
[2:07:50] that for you I'm carrying like a trophy
[2:07:52] or a crown I'm so proud to carry your
[2:07:55] approach are you willing I'm very
[2:07:58] willing I say yes what I'll do it
[2:08:00] because I'll have treasures in heaven
[2:08:03] hallelujah you know the believer is the
[2:08:05] best businessman in all the world
[2:08:06] because they invest in the right place
[2:08:08] are you investing in the right place
[2:08:11] he'd better be investing in the right
[2:08:13] place because one day this will be ashes
[2:08:15] and then when you go to the bank of
[2:08:17] heaven do you have an account sir ma'am
[2:08:19] no I'm sorry you're not here off you go
[2:08:25] for some people that will be that way
[2:08:27] but I serve this church I did this I did
[2:08:29] this
[2:08:30] no you're not here but I did this and
[2:08:34] this and this and this
[2:08:35] you're not here sir hey sure we've never
[2:08:38] had a virus in our computer system sir
[2:08:41] because they're placed razors in the
[2:08:43] wrong place
[2:08:44] I want to put treasures in heaven it's
[2:08:47] been his approach you know there's a
[2:08:49] reward we forget sometimes you're the
[2:08:51] devil says well if you stop if you got
[2:08:53] to dress modestly you've got to dress
[2:08:54] this way and speak this way and get rid
[2:08:56] of your shorts and the tight pants all
[2:08:57] these different things or people will
[2:08:59] make fun of you and he doesn't show you
[2:09:00] if you do these things because you love
[2:09:02] them and it's in this word you'll have
[2:09:04] eternal life that the reward is so much
[2:09:07] greater than their then their perceived
[2:09:09] retina and the end the stigma of it mid
[2:09:18] 30 degree temperature all but it's
[2:09:20] tropical wouldn't you wear truffle of
[2:09:21] clothing I did and the sisters dress the
[2:09:26] right way
[2:09:27] hallelujah and it's and it's hot and
[2:09:30] everyone sweating doesn't matter if
[2:09:32] you're local or not a local that's
[2:09:34] thinking hot but the believers still
[2:09:37] address the right way oh but it's hot
[2:09:39] over there so what I'll bear theater
[2:09:41] approach I want to be idea I don't want
[2:09:44] to try and be different but I'm proud
[2:09:45] few people say well why do you like this
[2:09:47] well do you really want enough beer
[2:09:53] you must be let us bear his reproach let
[2:09:56] us go forth therefore unto him without
[2:10:01] the camp bearing his reproach Hebrews 13
[2:10:04] 13 see it's not just under something
[2:10:06] else it's under him where he is you
[2:10:09] we're gonna be where he is
[2:10:11] you understand Esau sold his birthright
[2:10:16] we must be careful we not do that we
[2:10:19] must not do the same thing now a season
[2:10:24] in hearing receiving acting on the Word
[2:10:26] of God 1916
[2:10:27] now we find that this birthright mean
[2:10:29] everything to Jacob now he didn't care
[2:10:31] for it for nothing else but that
[2:10:33] birthright he didn't care what it cost
[2:10:35] him I trust me and say ah I'm a Jacob
[2:10:38] today if it was a mess of pottage he was
[2:10:41] glad to give it back to Esau so what so
[2:10:43] does with any man a woman that's been
[2:10:45] ordained to eternal life that God is
[2:10:47] called to eternal life is willing to
[2:10:49] sell out anything of the world to obtain
[2:10:51] that birthright you can call them
[2:10:54] anything you want to you can tell them
[2:10:57] they've lost their mind
[2:10:58] gone off on the deep end bunch of holy
[2:11:00] rollers I don't care what you call them
[2:11:02] they're seeking for that birthright and
[2:11:04] that means more than anything else they
[2:11:07] are after that birthright no matter how
[2:11:10] they have to get it they're ready to get
[2:11:12] it remember the birthright today is
[2:11:13] being sealed into the kingdom by the
[2:11:14] Holy Ghost and you're blessed to hunger
[2:11:17] and thirst so I just got to thank him
[2:11:20] that your hunger and thirst account or
[2:11:21] mine wants God to bring the birthright
[2:11:23] down to their level make it more
[2:11:26] approachable for me god that's what a
[2:11:28] cattleman wants to do but for me and I
[2:11:30] believe all true born Christians we meet
[2:11:34] it on God's level which is according to
[2:11:36] his word I don't care what I have to do
[2:11:38] or what I have to say or how I have to
[2:11:40] act the only thing I want it it means
[2:11:43] more than my popularity it means more
[2:11:45] than my job that means more than my
[2:11:47] mother more than my wife more than my
[2:11:49] children more than every friend I've got
[2:11:51] let me have that birthright hallelujah
[2:11:56] that's that's how it's got to be I don't
[2:11:58] care what people think of me I don't
[2:12:00] care I actually have one in my jacket
[2:12:02] pocket I don't care what people say
[2:12:06] about me I don't care about how people
[2:12:08] treat me what are the inside ones I want
[2:12:12] that birthright hallelujah remember God
[2:12:17] is a gentleman he doesn't enforce
[2:12:20] anything upon you you may even say I
[2:12:22] don't understand I don't even understand
[2:12:27] why Cain Cain was told by God you don't
[2:12:31] even need to understand why it was blood
[2:12:33] just do like your brother did you'll be
[2:12:36] accepted that that's what God told them
[2:12:40] you go read Genesis 4 just do like your
[2:12:42] brother did and you'll be accepted and
[2:12:45] so it's very simple you see people who
[2:12:50] are rejoicing good times and bad times
[2:12:54] and they're victorious life and they've
[2:12:57] pushed through and they're happy and why
[2:13:03] is that they've been accepted remember
[2:13:05] Jesus was accepted in Iran on our behalf
[2:13:08] we always need to accept him the person
[2:13:10] Jesus Christ
[2:13:12] hallelujah and so now you see others
[2:13:17] have been accepted they say just do like
[2:13:19] your brother done just do like your
[2:13:20] sister then you'll be accepted Cain was
[2:13:25] given an opportunity you say well are
[2:13:27] you calling me a cane or a niece or well
[2:13:30] you may be but you don't have to stay in
[2:13:32] that condition that was under the blood
[2:13:35] of bulls and goats their nature could
[2:13:37] never be changed that way but under the
[2:13:38] blood of Jesus Christ there's a power
[2:13:40] prison in this room right now that he
[2:13:42] can change you from a nice order or a
[2:13:45] cane amen he can change you from them
[2:13:48] the son or daughter of God he can I've
[2:13:52] seen it happen too much first Peter 13
[2:13:56] wherefore gird up your loins of your
[2:13:58] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[2:14:00] the grace that is to reboard unto you by
[2:14:03] the at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:14:05] we're living in that hour as obedient
[2:14:08] children not fashioning yourselves
[2:14:09] according to the former lusts and your
[2:14:11] ignorance but as he saw first Peter 1
[2:14:15] and 15 now but as he which has called
[2:14:20] you as holy so be holy in all manner of
[2:14:23] conversation because it has written be
[2:14:26] holy for I am holy and if you call on
[2:14:29] the father who without respect of
[2:14:31] persons judgeth according to every man's
[2:14:33] work past the time of your sojourning
[2:14:36] here and fear for as much as you know
[2:14:41] that you were not redeemed with
[2:14:43] corruptible things we ought to think
[2:14:44] about what redeemed us it wasn't the
[2:14:47] blood of a juror of Gentiles the blood
[2:14:49] of God himself God Himself became your
[2:14:52] sacrifice hallelujah the varying his
[2:14:55] name shall be called Emmanuel God with
[2:14:57] us Amen God salvation was manifested in
[2:15:01] a man I mean to bear our infirmities
[2:15:03] amen to take our whooping to take our
[2:15:05] judgment I mean the reason the cross was
[2:15:08] such a severe penalty I mean it's
[2:15:10] because that was the penalty God
[2:15:12] required for sin to be done away with
[2:15:15] amen he was mad beyond any man beyond
[2:15:18] any man he was mad and he and there was
[2:15:20] the joy of sit before him
[2:15:22] I'm willing to take these beatings I'm
[2:15:24] willing to be scourged I'm willing for a
[2:15:26] crown of thorns be put on my head and
[2:15:28] they poisoned from my stones were into
[2:15:30] his hidden sand and caused it to puff up
[2:15:32] I'm willing for my bed to be ripped out
[2:15:34] to be spit on to be mocked to be
[2:15:36] rejected to die with a broken heart
[2:15:38] because it's worth it to redeem them
[2:15:41] hallelujah there wasn't a small thing it
[2:15:45] wasn't a small thing to be done and he
[2:15:48] win as a sinner he he went to hell as a
[2:15:51] center in your place
[2:15:52] amen yeah it's not a small thing oh my
[2:15:56] we should be the happiest people in all
[2:15:58] the world for as much as you know that
[2:16:00] you're not redeemed with corruptible
[2:16:01] things as silver and gold from your vain
[2:16:03] conversation received by tradition from
[2:16:06] your father's but with the precious
[2:16:08] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[2:16:10] blemish blemish and without spot who
[2:16:13] verily was foreordained before the
[2:16:14] foundation of the world but was
[2:16:16] manifested in these last times for you I
[2:16:18] mean the son of man has been revealed in
[2:16:20] the cellar
[2:16:21] who by him do believe in God that raised
[2:16:23] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[2:16:25] that your hope so that your faith and
[2:16:28] hope might be in God at least he says so
[2:16:31] past the time of your sojourning here in
[2:16:33] fear and then Paul even says that you
[2:16:36] know he walks he lives in such a way
[2:16:40] that's so he doesn't become a shipwreck
[2:16:43] like others so even Paul himself it yo
[2:16:47] he had the revelation he had a
[2:16:49] dispensation of the gospel most the New
[2:16:50] Testament was written by this man but he
[2:16:53] didn't just wait on through he knew what
[2:16:55] it mean he knew what the grace of God
[2:16:57] really was he says I want to live a live
[2:17:00] a life in such a way that I do not
[2:17:03] become a shipwreck I like other people
[2:17:05] this was Paul's attitude amen and we're
[2:17:09] being restored back to the gospel that
[2:17:10] Paul preached howl ooh yeah amen now
[2:17:17] let's go to Philippians 2 I believe it
[2:17:23] is
[2:17:35] it says wherefore my beloved we'll just
[2:17:40] turn we've got to take it serious you
[2:17:45] know let's not just wait on through cuz
[2:17:47] it's tradition well this is what we've
[2:17:50] been doing for a few years now no let's
[2:17:51] let's take it I'm more thankful for the
[2:17:54] grace of God I'm more thankful for him
[2:17:57] calling me now that I was 10 years ago
[2:17:59] I'm more thankful I ask of my heart Lord
[2:18:02] keep me keep me when I just say a simple
[2:18:05] prayer that girls in the morning Lord we
[2:18:07] give our lives to you keep us every day
[2:18:10] I mean it with all my heart I say Lord
[2:18:13] we surrender our wills we don't want our
[2:18:16] own will any more I don't want to speak
[2:18:18] of me how do you know Jesus said I come
[2:18:20] to do only my father's will
[2:18:22] so how do you know you're redeemed you
[2:18:24] no longer want your own will
[2:18:27] who's redeemed and maybe you trust the
[2:18:31] question well if you still want to do
[2:18:32] your own will you should say God redeem
[2:18:35] me Ephesians 2 and 12 wherefore my
[2:18:41] beloved as you have always obeyed not as
[2:18:44] much as my presence only but now much
[2:18:46] more in my absence work out your own
[2:18:48] salvation with fear and trembling for it
[2:18:51] is God which worketh in you both to will
[2:18:54] and to do of his good pleasure so that's
[2:18:58] it is actually so you got to work out
[2:19:00] your own salvation with fear and
[2:19:02] trembling and for it's God's it's God
[2:19:05] which worketh in you both to will end do
[2:19:08] it as good play it's God working but you
[2:19:10] can't just take it casual well if I'm
[2:19:12] bright are bright if I'm not bright I'm
[2:19:14] not bright if I'm not bright I'll be
[2:19:15] fullest version of I'm fullest version
[2:19:16] I'll go white throne judgment and if I
[2:19:18] grow the white throne judgment I'll get
[2:19:19] mercy I wouldn't ever want to that's
[2:19:22] it's like a suicide machine
[2:19:24] you're never you never we should never
[2:19:27] have that kind of you know that's just
[2:19:29] unbelief speaking if you lean too much
[2:19:32] for if I'm in are moving from outer
[2:19:34] mount no as I seen a few wind days it
[2:19:36] you know your Wednesday's ago about
[2:19:40] here's the Ark and we know the rain fell
[2:19:43] before the monkey here before the
[2:19:45] animals are going home but just imagine
[2:19:46] the animals are going up just say you're
[2:19:50] a chimpanzee or a monkey and you're
[2:19:52] going up the ramp and there's a male and
[2:19:55] female monkey ahead of you of your same
[2:19:57] species and you're the third one what
[2:19:59] are you gonna do are you gonna say well
[2:20:02] I guess I wasn't ordained to go on the
[2:20:04] ark and you just die perish with the
[2:20:05] rest of the world or are you gonna are
[2:20:07] you gonna push the other one off the
[2:20:09] ramp and get in what's your attitude
[2:20:12] what do you want to be because faith
[2:20:15] would say no it's my promise faith and
[2:20:18] say no I belong in that Ark I must be in
[2:20:20] that ugh I'm more danger be in that oh
[2:20:22] and you will push you on off the red you
[2:20:25] say well that's not nice to the other
[2:20:26] one but you talk about your own eternal
[2:20:28] destination amen
[2:20:31] so or do you say well I guess I'm just
[2:20:33] not ordained to be in there what do you
[2:20:35] want to be if I'm the third monkey on
[2:20:38] the ramp I'm not gonna stay the third
[2:20:40] monkey I'm gonna be the one offs first
[2:20:43] or second monkey because the first or
[2:20:45] second monkey have a place you gotta
[2:20:49] think what do you want to be say well I
[2:20:50] guess I'm not ordained no how do you
[2:20:52] know that that's the devil lying to you
[2:20:54] yes that's a devil oh you haven't
[2:20:56] responded yet that's the devil lying to
[2:20:58] you he's lying to you because he doesn't
[2:21:01] want you to accept what you have your
[2:21:04] eternal life because when you begin to
[2:21:05] really say no this is my promise and I
[2:21:08] don't care what others think I don't
[2:21:10] even care what I think oh my god I'm
[2:21:11] gonna take you at your word and I'm
[2:21:13] gonna live according to your word
[2:21:14] because I love you so my heart and you
[2:21:16] died on the cross for me I don't care
[2:21:18] about anyone then the Devils in trouble
[2:21:20] it goes that because that slave muscle
[2:21:23] that's been beating you down with
[2:21:25] reasoning and good eye things that be
[2:21:27] seemingly good to Aqaba mind then he
[2:21:29] goes under your feet I want to trade on
[2:21:33] the devil the Bible said I'm going to
[2:21:35] trade on the young one and the Ender and
[2:21:36] the dragon so I said god I want a
[2:21:38] manifest that scripture that's my
[2:21:40] scripture I mean I don't want to be
[2:21:43] beating around and just go with the tide
[2:21:44] and all this is this and this is listen
[2:21:47] if one you know let's let's press into
[2:21:50] the kingdom the violent take the kingdom
[2:21:52] by force
[2:21:53] it doesn't mean you get a whipping and
[2:21:56] you and you invade that way but the
[2:21:58] violence god I want it I don't want to
[2:22:00] be lukewarm and just lie back and but
[2:22:03] Lord hears your promise I want to press
[2:22:05] into the kingdom hallelujah we can do it
[2:22:09] the reason I'm saying this thing is
[2:22:11] because we can do it well what do you
[2:22:13] want to be because God gave you a free
[2:22:16] will even Cain would have received
[2:22:18] eternal life you know that as he was
[2:22:21] willing to soar into his will to God's
[2:22:23] will
[2:22:24] he would have seen actually that's why I
[2:22:26] sacrificed I want to be accepted one of
[2:22:29] your lambs and because I was manifesting
[2:22:32] God because there's only a few of us
[2:23:32] well how do you receive it he rejected
[2:23:34] truth and he came against the ones who
[2:23:37] had the truth and then he was sealed to
[2:23:39] his eternal doom and he was sent out
[2:23:41] from the presence of God and that's what
[2:23:44] happened to him and God doesn't change a
[2:23:46] man doesn't change but if he was willing
[2:23:50] to surrender his will we would see him
[2:23:54] one day in heaven but he wasn't willing
[2:23:57] to give it over as pride pride manifests
[2:24:01] in a lot of ways he's too proud too
[2:24:03] proud to Humble himself to the word in
[2:24:04] his hour
[2:24:05] how about you how about you you say well
[2:24:15] what's the flip side of all this thing
[2:24:18] the flip side is if God has given us
[2:24:22] access to eternal life you know think
[2:24:24] about it
[2:24:25] in the book of Genesis I believe it's
[2:24:27] four it says the cherubim was was put
[2:24:30] there to protect you go read the words
[2:24:33] away then tree of life is Jesus Christ
[2:24:46] so here's these cherubim self and this
[2:24:50] do they still cherubim are still
[2:24:53] protecting this word and Matthew 28:19
[2:24:56] baptized the name of Father Son Holy
[2:24:58] Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:24:59] brother his debt is a gospel god that's
[2:25:01] a chairman particular way the life is
[2:25:04] always
[2:26:04] what's your business doing here
[2:26:06] I want eternal life you shall receive
[2:26:13] the gift of the Holy Ghost the full
[2:26:14] Europe even die you must be born again
[2:26:21] going to give you a whole heart
[2:26:23] everything you are you say that's
[2:26:35] awfully harsh no God we are not the top
[2:26:39] of the food chain
[2:26:40] yes we are not the top of the food chain
[2:26:43] God is the top of the food chain and God
[2:26:45] is sovereign God chooses who he will he
[2:26:48] calls who he will be justify so he will
[2:26:51] hear he Dean's who he will he condemns
[2:26:54] who he will but God doesn't condemn
[2:26:58] someone without giving them warning he
[2:27:01] doesn't he doesn't he's not going to
[2:27:04] cast anyone into hell just be just just
[2:27:07] no reason whatsoever
[2:27:09] yo come a point just like the rich young
[2:27:12] ruler
[2:27:12] he'll come before the throne and that
[2:27:15] and when this one was standing in front
[2:27:18] of them one thing now let's tell all
[2:27:21] that you have give to the poor take up
[2:27:22] your cross and follow me you'll have
[2:27:23] treasures in heaven that conversation
[2:27:25] will come back to his mind and also the
[2:27:31] feeling he had walking away said we'll
[2:27:34] come back to his mind and that will be
[2:27:37] unfortunately his own condemnation well
[2:27:41] his own actions condemn them
[2:27:43] unfortunately but that's how it is
[2:27:45] because God gives your choice so now if
[2:27:49] that's the case and you've come and gods
[2:27:58] allowed you in God allowed you in one
[2:28:02] day on my knees I meet my
[2:28:04] when you really died out hallelujah I
[2:28:06] was sitting I was I was listening to
[2:28:08] brother Branham I was in university
[2:28:10] drinking and doing all these things God
[2:28:12] delivered me of the alcohol and
[2:28:14] everything one day I was studying
[2:28:16] organic chemistry in the science library
[2:28:18] at Canterbury University and that's just
[2:28:20] this just out of nowhere just as this
[2:28:22] conviction came upon me and God said to
[2:28:25] me he said if you died right right now
[2:28:27] without the Holy Ghost you'd be lost
[2:28:29] it's just how the conviction came on me
[2:28:30] I don't know where but God has been
[2:28:33] dealing with me for quite a while I pack
[2:28:34] up all my books I go I go back to my
[2:28:37] house I lay it all down and then after
[2:28:40] that the Bible became a new book God
[2:28:43] filled by love with us Hardy did many
[2:28:45] things but I believe was true what if I
[2:28:47] just did not convenient for me would I
[2:29:04] be here I believe by God's mercy and
[2:29:07] grace because he knew me before the
[2:29:08] foundation of the world I wouldn't be
[2:29:09] here but what if not to me I know I'm
[2:29:16] produced no because he's transformed my
[2:29:18] life push you to make sure you actually
[2:29:25] have what you believe you have and then
[2:29:29] we can't just wait on sin and say but
[2:29:30] I'm the bride your life will prove what
[2:29:34] you are I'm gonna read this one more
[2:29:48] thing as I know it's late there's in the
[2:29:50] sixth seal and I think it ought to be
[2:29:52] truly settled in every believers heart
[2:29:54] and this that this church never takes
[2:29:57] the tribulation period
[2:29:58] you cannot put nowhere the church in the
[2:30:01] tribulation oh you can put the church
[2:30:02] there but not the bride see the bride
[2:30:04] goes on because she's got not one sin
[2:30:08] not a thing against her the grace of God
[2:30:10] has covered her over and the bleach has
[2:30:13] took every sin so far away
[2:30:15] there's not even a room
[2:30:17] Aaron saw it not a thing but purity
[2:30:19] perfect in the presence of God oh it
[2:30:22] ought to make the bride get down on her
[2:30:25] knees and cry out to God hallelujah
[2:30:29] for us to really do you really recognize
[2:30:31] that you possum get the life do you
[2:30:33] really know that God has allowed you and
[2:30:35] here's a chair you gave you all over
