amen god bless you all I mean good morning everyone good good to see you all just everyone's happy rejoicing in spite of whatever trials we may be facing our God is awesome I mean and he is supreme above all things hallelujah let's just go to Deuteronomy chapter 8 if you've got your Bibles handy and then also there's the we want to have the youth snow trip on the I think starting on the 21st of September until the Saturday if you're coming you be eight and older if you're coming brother our man needs to know okay so if you have children they can come we please tell them soon as possible so we can plan everything I mean it's gonna be a blizzard times up by a matter of pay who I believe we're going to be covered in snow and we have a good time I mean it's also gonna be a good time in the Lord too so Deuteronomy chapter 8 and we'll read from read from verse 10 and we're gonna read down to verse 17 it says so this is Moses giving us last instructions well let's actually go from verse 7 down to verse 17 for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains of depths that spring out of valleys and hills a land of wheat sorry bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains of dips that spring out of valleys a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil of oil olive soy and honey a land Aaron thou shalt eat bread without scare sness thou shall not lack in anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills they'll make biggest brass when thou has eaten and are full then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he has given me beware that they'll forget not the LORD thy God and not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day lease when thou has eaten and out full and has built goodly houses excuse me and dwelt there and and when my herds and my flocks multiply and my silver and my gold is multiplied and all that thou hath is multiplied then thy heart be lifted up and now forgetting the LORD thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness Grenn was wearing were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought which there was no water which brought thee forth out water out of the rock of Flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy father's knew not that he might Humble thee and that he might prove thee to to do the good at I let her in that I and thou say in thine heart my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth amen and this also go to I know we just finished here actually god bless you friends you may have your seats now I want to really speak on a subject that I know I've probably touched it a few times but I want to post a question to you well we're gonna read a bit later on but my subject really this morning is as influences things that influence but you'll notice in the Bible and history repeats itself because man does not change right it doesn't matter what covenant man is under a man is still the same so history repeats itself because man does not change now we read the scripture because we can parallel what Moses is telling them with the Christian journey as in the bride of Jesus Christ in this last H and as a local body and as an individual in Christ right so now here here they had been brought they had been brought out of Egypt by a supernatural ministry God sent them a prophet God was in that prophet and God sent Moses down into Egypt to deliver his people that they're once slaves now once in bondage now was just a tool in the hands of Pharaoh God delivered them supernaturally and he was going to place him in a land of promise he was going to place them in the land that really belonged to them into the Promised Land and so God had delivered them an incredible way and now they had come to a spot where he is Moses because Moses couldn't go into the Promised Land but Moses is warning them when you get into this kind of condition when it life begins it becomes easy when you're when you're established in your inheritance right beware then you know many times it's after the victory that's when the enemy comes in amen and that's when he deals his fatal blow so and we can see it and and the life of will go to you sire we'll go to King David but then we'll go to the Apostle Paul because the Apostle Paul broke the cycle hallelujah many years I've got it written down here later on but you know he saw he met the Lord on the road to Damascus and God supernaturally met him and then I think it's it's quite a few years down the road he's been through hardship he's seen great victory he seen churches birth reveries went he's seen the same God that met him meets other people you know he seen ministry raised up he's seen incredible things and he stood in front of King Agrippa and said I was not disobedient to the heavenly version so he was his course remained unaltered he knew what he was called to do he didn't get your he didn't just relax and maybe you know make some Empire for himself and maybe make some kind of you know he could have just set back maybe an emphasis or somewhere and just send out letters and life could have got easy and that way you know we we live in rest if you're in Christ you've been sent into eternal rest but that's not the kind of rest that I'm talking about this dangerous right so I talked about when things were going to get rested I'm not talking about your spiritual state I'm talking about when we're now you are now I've conquered this enemy and then you begin to if you lose vision of what you're called to be and that's when the enemy comes in because remember the promised land wasn't just given that they could have a land flowing with milk and honey and have and have a lot of food and have a lot in ice places the promised land was given because God gave them that land that they would have her that they would walk with God in that land right the promised land was God his word would be fulfilled when they're in that land Moses even tells him that that you will go into this land and you'll fulfill the word that's been given amen so it's not the promised land wasn't just a place to enjoy the goodness of life it was to walk with the Living God and it's the same thing with you and I as that knowing him as not just to have a never ever have a nice life or nice families or a nice church it's more than that has to walk with the Living God amen so now God delivered them as I said he delivered them out of out of Egypt brought them into the Promised Land they went into their inheritance after this Deuteronomy you know Joshua meet the same God Moses met and he placed them in their inheritance now we understand that we are living now in the time of not the first Exodus coming out of Egypt or the second one coming out of a out of old formal religions into Christ but we have come into a time of a third Exodus who who's heard the message the third Exodus I trust you've heard that I mean so so that you're so brother Bremer is now paralleling now the first Exodus God sent a prophet they had a blood sacrifice they came out Egypt under the atonement and God placed them in the land into into Palestine which was an exodus out of Egypt now - from a natural land into a natural lands they left Egypt they went into Israel and then the second Exodus was when Christ came and he delivered the people out of cold formal religion and he and he took them not into another physical place but he brought them into a spiritual rest in himself and so now the 3rd Exodus now is that God is calling the people to leave this world to go into heaven I mean that is the third Exodus now so we have been called because the same pillar of fire they met Moses in a burning bush the same pillar of fire that dwelt in Jesus Christ the same pillar fire which was God member that's gardener form he came in the upper room and wealth and a hundred and twenty and that same pillar father met Paul on the road to Damascus reappeared in these last days amen to show that people here I have come amen to reveal myself to you to take you from this world to the next world amen so now this is so this is a great time now where God has moved upon the earth and every kindred nation and tongue and he's gathering a people to himself hallelujah now so so we have been brought out of slavery I trust you've been brought out of slavery that you're not a slave to you to this world you're not a slave to your flesh you don't pander to what you want above all things I mean you're not a slave to a just dead religion but you've been delivered out of that house of bondage and now you serve a living God hallelujah so now so we have been called in an exodus Amen yeah we are the most privileged people and it's not just a nice four walls that surround the world I mean God has called the people and they've gathered hallelujah they've gathered unto Him amen and so now we the same thing God set the spirit of Elijah upon the earth to forerunner second coming and God is not physically come buddy spiritually here all the crisis has been revealed I mean the opening of the seals I hope you don't trip on it first the full word intimate birth Center for men manifestation I mean to all the Jesus all the goddesses present upon the earth but he's not here in his physical form was corporal body we will meet him that way in the air amen he comes God down he comes and speaks to Moses I have come down go read Exodus 4 I've heard the cries for my people I have come down to deliver them and I'm sending you everything God was was now veiled in a pillar foreigner and a burning bush amen and then that same God because he's the angel of the Covenant comes down and he becomes flesh in Jesus Christ hallelujah and and Paul meets the same one amen so now we've been called out now but then there's the challenge as they receive the same challenge they're in the in the Old Testament this must not become just a culture this must not just become a way of life as in as and this is how we dress that we go to church maybe two times a week you know we we dress a certain way we do certain things we don't do other things you know it just becomes a dead culture must not come that way I mean because it's when it's when it becomes just a Christian culture I mean that's when the enemy comes in amen and that's when the people people become enslaved again you take the book of Judges you say well we've gone past the book of Judges David fell in the same trap the Kings fell into the same kind of trap amen is that weird you see it in the book of Judges is a cycle God comes upon the scene no they the people for some reason they forsake the Living God and their worship idols what are those idols ever do for them nothing but then now though that we're going to worship Bale and all different kinds of things and then the enemy comes in and they become enslaved and then they call out upon God and God sends a deliverer and God delivers them and then they go to idols again and then they call out upon God and God delivers them and they call out upon God you know and it's a cycle all this up because man does not change amen and it's it's the same thing let's go let's go to judges chapter 2 they'll say well you may let's just read this quickly but maybe just as we're turning you say well that sounds crazy you read the book of Judges this is madness here's the people God got that incredible things for them you take you take just one plate falling in Egypt that's incredible you take the Red Sea opening that's incredible you take them crossing Jordan this there's a bunch of priests carrying a golden box the Ark of the Covenant they step into the river and the river parts like dry land they cross over about a million people that's incredible they walk around Jericho a certain way and they shot and they blow the trumpets the seventh time on the seventh day the walls fall down flat that's incredible I mean they're fighting an enemy Joshua stands up Sun stand still moon stands still until we defeat our enemies and it did that's incredible hallelujah well then what on earth would people go from that to serving idols I'll tell you what it is influence it's an influence came in comes in subtly even sometimes sounds like a good idea you know like you take first or second kings you take after Solomon there's a few kings where they where the with the people of Belial the people of bale come into the King King whoever it is they say you should worship this God look how he's prospered these nations and there's the Assyrians and Grady empires rising up if we worship their gods will be like them and they worship their gods and they were destroyed so logically it's all that kind of sounds right but it's an influence comes in because people they begin to look at political power and they begin to look at the nations around them and see it up just being sold out to serving God judges chapter 2 now influence here's one influence dying and another influence coming forth judges 2 and 7 and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua which had seen all the great work to the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance and timotheus and the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill of gash and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel so this is Judges chapter two and now we're in verse ten I'll give you time if you're still turning look at this you say how could this happen you say we're under the blood of the New Covenant yes we are but influences are still influencing we are not immune you got to understand we are not immune to the works of the enemy we are not immune to his devices we are not ignorant of his devices but we're not immune that's why the enemy comes and against you you know that's why the same same battles that that we fight people in the world fight but the difference is we have overcoming power I mean we ever the kept that of the hosters Jesus he is the one who fights our battles for us amen so now are we all there verse 10 and also all that generation that gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel and the children of Israel did evil in the sight Lord and serve Balaam Balaam and they forsook the Lord their God of their fathers and brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves under them and provoked the Lord to anger Wow here's a people I'm gonna hire eyes what a really stress this point because you've got to really come I'm going to maybe jump forward to jump back a few times you got to look at yourself look at your family look at your children and you asked your question how I treat my spouse how I raise my children how I have my family is it according to tradition or culture now there's good things introducing good things in culture but there's also bad things right as there you know other other ways I have my family and conduct myself as that position in the family is it according to the word of the Lord or is it tradition I just one I'm just gonna I'm just throwing it out there amen how we because we cannot we do not want to be blinded because what happens now you can go through history and you can see parents have made the same mistakes their forebears made and the next generation makes the same mistake a next generation makes the same mistake and then the and in the next generation makes the same mistake why are you repeating that because there's been a lot of generations who've made a lot of mistakes I mean but the good news is oh maybe I'll just put this now this is going to be maybe a bit more of a heavy kind of service but here we are okay I'm just sorry this is just how does but the question is now how we raise our children is it because we've seen our parents make mistakes and we say I will never do that see you swing the other way yeah I mean how you doing it you say just say if they were just say if they I never had anything nice when I was growing up and my siblings got it all so then now I'm gonna never treat my kids on there and you just spoil them rotten you change what you do out of a complex out of pain instead of actually saying a lot give me godly wisdom how I can be a good parent Amen you see how you're just say if you're you know just say you saw how your mum treated your dad you say I'm not going to treat my husband that way and then you swing time in the opposite direction or vice versa now is that out of complex or is that out of actually Holy Ghost leadership I mean because subconsciously you got to understand how we raise our children or how we you know how we raise our children as more than the words we say it is what they see is doing right so many times you can see families where there is see children often they don't see the love you know and I'll put it this way there can be a great love between husband and wife and then that that they just love each other so much but then how the husband treats the wife as the wife will just do everything for the husband and then because they don't see the love I hope this comes out right okay because the parents our children are done yes you see the love the sons will now just treat their wives when they get married just like servants you understand there's no that they don't see the love involved in the relationship is that okay right so they will they will see what's going on but they actually understand what's going on and I'll say that's how I should treat a wife or that's how I should treat a husband right so it's more actually what we do as opposed to what we say has a great influence a meant and so the question has to be now we have to understand as well there is a spirit in this nation you go into any nation under heaven there's a spirit you go to the you go to Germany you'll go to one of those nations it's a military kind of spirit you know you go to America it's a haha kind of spirit you know you come down to New Zealand and there's just a she'll be right take it easy you know it's a different kind of spirit again now we live in that atmosphere around here right the how how the nation was was shaped and the British coming here in different nationalities coming here this great melting pot their spirits have come in and you say well I'm not off that I've been birthed by the Holy Ghost amen but the thing is that thing will try and influence you it'll try and influence you you know you take the you take the bad side of the old Kiwi culture you know the not the number-8 fencing wire mentality where just take what you have in user to the best you can but the whole dad is distant doesn't talk just goes and works comes home no relationship with children you know and that was from results of the second world war from Korea from Vietnam War you know whole generation came back scarred and battle scarred and shell-shocked and you know and there was no way for them to deal with it so they just withdrew within themselves trying to cope with their own scars and pain and then what does that do to the next generation but it becomes a culture Amen now that's the quick now so the question is now do we as that influenced us and would have somewhere because I'm sure we've all had who's had forebears it fought in the war who's that forebears that fought in First World War Second World War Korea Vietnam any kind of war that will if that has affected you either directly or indirectly a meant who's who's had four bits that if that have suffered very violent crime yep that will have that has affected you either directly or indirectly amen and so now those things have been passed down whether we like it or not what do we do with it do it you say this is my lot in life you know as I've seen a while ago my brother Tim Pruett see that's like it's just a grab bag of life it's like a bag something you just grab out whatever you get that blogs to you well you may grab something out but what do you do with it do you say oh this is mine but you say I do not want this this will not rule me I will not be subject to this thing it's influence I mean because we must understand God is not a cookie cutter so how all of us living different all of us have different backgrounds all of us live in different environments right so there's not a cookie cutter this is how a family must live in a certain kind of socio-economic place and you know have this kind of a house and dad must have this kind of a job and you know it's not a cookie cut away right so there's variables within it but yet within all the way how is home and influence and influence the the definition of an influence is the capacity to have an effect on the character the development or behavior of someone or something or the effect itself so it's an and influence will mold you right I'm going to be real this may be laborious but just bear with me all things come to an end but I want you to think about these things right because what is so what influences us the most we will become okay so it's either see because that's why people that's why the world they put up and I've seen as before but they'll put music videos out there or or movies or books that are ungodly and it captures the imagination of people you say well and we know some people here that they'll say that only ever influenced me but it does anyway without the Holy Ghost things will influence you the wrong way and so people see an image and they and they see a you know like a movie star saying sir I want to become that well let's see a sports star I remember being there I want to become that you know we were we were talking at work just at morning tea you know what did you want to do when you grew up I said I still don't know but I see well I wanted to I wanted a sale in the America's Cup I wanted to be in them and the Black Caps you know what I wanted to whatever was the fair of the day you know that caught my attention I wanted to become it a mint so it's whatever captures your imagination that's why you want to become you got to look now and say where will this influence take me Lord because you can have all the good intentions well without the Lord steering where you're going to go remember I said I see it a couple of Sundays ago there's a perfect world and there's a permissive world so we can't just we can't just plow on through life saying I'm always in the perfect will of God amen because there is a permissive will that we can go down but I believe God will steer you out of it amen it was that was God's permissive will for a lot of things to happen but God will steer you out of it right so we want to really look at now now don't be afraid just walk with God if you the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the law you have to walk in a direction right and if you're if you're flexible to him he will guide you I mean she can't just stand still and say God show me what to do today just walk and he'll show you got to have confidence of the one that's leading you amen so now whatever mold you now let's just go to and ask you the question now what does influence union the most and it's something of this world that's influencing you or is it God Himself is influencing you because if it's God you'll become like him you'll have his nature and his character that's what you'll receive but if it's of the world maybe you can be a religious person and you can be influenced by the world more than God and that is terrible way to be in because someone who's just religious will justify themselves all the day long at least I'm not like that person and there'll always be someone who's worse than you in your eyes and as soon as you see them remember the consciousness yo it's amazing look down at faces you know and you know what's going on in yourself and God dealing don't just try and justify but at least I'm not that person I'd say grab that grab that conviction say God here I come hallelujah here I come God changing mold me I mean done just justified say well at least I'm not struggling like that person is I mean there were two people went into the temple one day as a Pharisee and there was a sinner and the Pharisee they're both praying and he's the Pharisee Pharisees and I think it's an actor means an actor just an outward religion nothing on the inside and he's praying there and he looks at this guy who's a sinner and he sinned us and the sinners ain't God forgive me forgive me for being this way genuinely from his heart crying out and the Pharisee saying he's probably convicted by the sky because one he's never seen Paulie he's never seen the Pharisees act like him but then he says thank you Lord I'm not like this guy I said who was more justified Jesus asked the sinner and seen as a Pharisee why he compared himself with someone else and the Bible says in second Corinthians should we read this yeah let's just jump to that 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 I believe it is I had it in my notes secret Dean's I know if I can find it might not even have it on me it escapes me now but here's here's some I second Corinthians 10 and 12 yes I had the right book see Corinthians 10 and 12 now this is real important no just just just verse so just verse 12 please brother a month for we dear listen but we did not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves right but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise right so if you compare yourself with someone else you are not wise they meant why is that because now your measuring stick becomes the other person we are not to compare ourselves by someone else that's a carnal man I'm better than this guy and if I'm not I'm going to make myself better than that guy I'm going to be number one let's drink it's very carnal we are to compare ourselves with this remember in here is the character of God in print form this is God in print form but the message is God and spoken word fall and you can go into those things and when you read this or you listen to the message which I pray you do you should say Lord mold me as I'm reading this to be mold me into your character as I'm reading amen it shouldn't just be well look look what I can read and try and remember which is fighting itself II should be there should be our hearts Lord we're laying ourselves before your presence mold me your character this is him in print form it should be Lord mold me so what is in this Bible becomes flesh so your character and remember we're called to be partakers of the divine nature so if we compare ourselves so don't compare yourself with someone else that is a big mistake we are not to be thank you for taking the done no let's go to judges chapter two and see them I saw we're rid there and we're gonna go to Isaiah chapter six influence here's Isaiah let's just read this down from first one down to verse 8 of Isaiah chapter 6 then we're gonna go on to talk about this a bit and the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the Seraphim each one had six wings with twain covered his face and with twain Kabbalist feet and with twain eated fly and cried unto another holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke Dean said I was me for I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts in flew one of the serums unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched thy lips that iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here I am send me now here's a man here's a young man he was he had a great influence in his life which was the King Uzziah king uzziah was about 16 years old when he came to the throne he was a shepherd boy and he served the Lord with all of his heart and the Lord prospered him on every hand you can go read about it and sick in chronicles 26 he was he was an incredible King and the influence of this King was very great on the Prophet but you see but they came to a spot in King his eyes life we won't read the account but go read second chronicles 26 so his kingdom prospered it became established and then he actually got lifted up in his heart and pride and thought now I can just do anything and then so he tries to take the office of a priest now here we are I'm just going to jump right on home because you where are you going with these stories here we are five years down the road the Lord has prospered us the Lord has been good to us amen I believe has been pushed back on every hand God has filled many people many people have been healed we have this place it's very nice isn't it we got wonderful musicians and songwriters and and great ministers and you know you know the Lord has been very good to us and God moves he's a living God for us he has established us now is the dangerous time now is the dangerous time because we're not we're not down there and grace-filled anymore we're draining you get buckets of water literally pouring through the ceiling it remembers those things they have a good day I mean but that was when we were kind of struggling you know fighting pressing the battle there's only a few of us if it may be 15 praise the Lord we're having a great time it's so many people here amen he remembers those days but now the Lord has been good and I pray he still is good to us but now we've got we've got establish we have Sunday school but wonderful Sunday School teachers great Sunday school great environment for our children great fellowship one for another you know we've got love between the Brethren all these wonderful things going on now is a dangerous time now's the dangerous time because we can get to a spot just like the Kings did some of them they said I can do anything I want now because the Lord just blesses me on every hand careful friends he he believes he could take the priests office he could do anything he took the censer the priests told them don't go in there you know two Levite your great kings day being a king don't don't try and take another man's office BC I can do what I want and weirdin tried to offer the go to take the center and offer it before the Lord and God smote him with leprosy and he died a leper amen then now this was a great shock to Isaiah because now a great influence in his life was now had fallen from grace and so now he begin to he began to think he went down to the temple to pray what's going on what's going on here and then he had the heavenly vision he was a prophet God was using him before this then now here comes God himself and he sees his condition he's got no one to compare himself with here and the presence of God you see these seraphim's the these serums they're there their eyes are covered their feet are covered they're covered they cry holy holy holy they're in the presence of God how much more people that have been washed by the blood how much more reverent we should be and thankful we should be he's a he's a he's a his created beings and their feet are covered and humility of their eyes are come they're all covered in every way and all they can cried is holy holy Lord God Almighty and here we are we should I pray that we have a that we have such I would say cultures by not the right word but we should have a culture we should reverence God we should absolutely reverence him we should be literally enough not always literally I mean we should be on our faces if we could be day and night brother Bram said if you the bride really knew what the Lord has done for her she would be crying out praising him day and night for what he's done and if you think about how great he is we were walking in darkness doesn't matter what church we were from doesn't matter what religious upbringing we had or lack of it God found us God called you and in God spoke to your heart you responded I mean he died on Calvary for you well you yet his enemy I mean he made away hallelujah I mean it wasn't just a religion but it became a reality that's why I always I fight I don't think I can say it enough he's a living God you must meet him for yourself don't let this become your daddy's religion your mummys religion your spouse's religion I mean don't need to become a culture it must be alive I mean because we have the greatest thing if you come in these doors and you think oh I have to go to church tonight so laborious it's so dumb you need to meet them I mean because it's the greatest privilege Amen as we can bow cuts in our heads and say our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name hallelujah people get excited people yo we just had the Lions to her whole bunch of people came from the other side of the earth they did didn't they and they they they saved up maybe four years I do not know and they gave themselves and they flew over here to support their team and narrator every match and they had the you know they had their you know the you're the team's yo playing strip on and everything and we think well that's just what people do why would they do that because they're excited about it this is the highlight of their life I went to the Lions tour of New Zealand 2017 it was a drawer as amazing it'll be a highlight of their they'll be you know and here we are this is eternal things you know that you really gotta think about it this is eternal thing this is eternal things I mean the message and eternal for hallelujah it's the most glorious thing and here's people move they fly from the other side of the world just for a few weeks and they loved every minute of it and here we come you know imagine if one of them came they're interviewed on TV got the Lions Jersey on so how's the tour going for you that's dumb well but they're such a great game now didn't like it what do you mean I'm bored I didn't want to come here but you spent all this money on house it you think something's wrong with that person wouldn't you you think why are they why they've given themselves and they're here well why are you here this person made me come well how are they oh I love this that's incredible the best game I've ever seen have you seen this that's amazing or when did you get to the stadium about an hour ago you know to me and then so what you think well why is this person like this and why is this other person hating it well this person is under the spirit of it and they've given themselves to it this person is not under the spirit of it that's why they don't like it and that's just a worldly that's already come and gone there's no eternal value of those things people went to Bermuda towards the America's Cup they go to the Olympics they saved up their money they go well it's not the same on TV I want to be in the atmosphere I want to be there when they run the hundred at the gold you know the final they're the Olympics I want to be there on the finish line they spend thousands of dollars and that's just a ticket amen and they're excited and it's just a 10-second race effect and here we are and if you you know that's why you've got to think about it well what would influence someone that they would sit there and say no this is actually dumb it's obviously not the rugby because if the rugby is the greatest influence and they'll love the tour and you take it and just you take it into eternal things come and sit here and say well this is dumb what's influencing what is influencing if you said you say how much longer well there's no clock anymore but you look at the clock I'm hungry I wonder what's for lunch I wonder what we're going to do what's going to happen Monday what's going to happen Tuesday what am I going to do now what about this and your mind goes off on some kind of tangent you know when is he going to be quiet and close and we're going to sing and I want to go out and I'm sick of this and done it it it it it it what's influencing I'm just going to broblem just right on home here we are you know something and then I can't wait for next Sunday and sometimes right now I'll just jump back to Israel they didn't throw the ark away they didn't throw the priesthood away they didn't throw away having a high priest they had all those things they didn't throw away the law of Moses they had it but what had happened something else incoming it wasn't a living reality it was just a learned thing and people can stand and they can say you can ask what is John 3:16 say I won't put anyone on the spot but most of us would know and he'd say well what does this mean and what does this mean and people just wrapping it off peridot did it in a litter you know is it real is it real it's like with you know you know with Moses and things they could sit there and say well you know like Gideon he said where is if God is with us where the miracles so they knew the stories of Egypt they knew the stories of Moses so was but it was just a tradition among them it wasn't a living reality so we can't just just just be quotas or paradis it must become a living reality what do you say about this Jesus called Christ what do you say because if he is your greatest influence I love coming to church and not because I stand here I don't come here to be seen I'd rather be in the back amen but I love I love going to prayer meeting I love listening to a tape you know I'm driving along Whoopi Theatre pyroar and there's traffic backed up hallelujah I'm stuck in traffic glory I get more time well I'm just listening to music or something praise the Lord I can just have a time amen you know it's I love it because I love his presence I love being around a member when I'm really when I'm standing here he's ministering to me as he's ministering to you hallelujah that's why you know but I like to be in his presence because I've been influenced hallelujah as I said well as me here's a prophet he's in the temple there's the holy places hold the office is as well as me I'm lost and undone who will go for us Here I am Lord seeing me and that should be the same thing worldly influences must die you look at because what you as I said what influences you will influences your choices in your go certain direction so you've got to look at your life and say now where is my life going where is it going is it staying towards the Lord do you want to that here's the question I'll just I just got on the young people for a little bit if you were an adult where will you be are you waiting just for the get out of jail free card to leave home just uh just to get out all this is so rigid this is so terrible I'll say if this is so terrible why your appearance doing it you know if this is such a terrible walk in such a yoke of bondage in US and a prison why your parents doing it cuz they've done everything else who was in the world I was in the world why am I here this is far better this is my glory there's far more satisfying there's no satisfaction out there amen I'm drinkin from a well of living water polar that'll never run dry I'm not looking for something else I found it and more importantly it found me hallelujah so if it's so great you know if the so this is why I'm here because this is a living reality and it's without money or price we do not earn it you know brother Bram said it used to be in the old days in the in the days of the Reformation they believed in the blood and works but in this in this generation when the whole word has become plain an orphan and is nothing but the blood amen it is nothing but the blood hallelujah so now we don't have to we do not have to worry about I know I just I just thought if it's so great out there why are we not out there why because if there's something better than this I'd rather be doing it you know why I've only got 70 maybe 70 years upon the earth you know threescore and ten has been allotted to every man some live longer some live shorter but you've only got a certain time span is like a countdown clock everyone's head if I have only this much time why would I do something I don't want to do if there's something better I meant and if there is something better we should find it but if this is if this is eternal if this is God that has spoken in this generation we should give everything we have to it and God has vindicated it over and over and over and over and over and over proving this is eternal this is God speaking talk about the message of the hour now now he says this is an influences the 90s sixty-four that's interesting because after the sermon he speaks US service identification there's a 1964 15th of February 1964 you do good to go listen he says now my subject tinnitus influences I want to read this story he says we would turn to second chronicles 26 chapter we could read it this news I was a shepherd boy 2nd chronicles 26 tells us he has anointed king at the age of 16 his father was a godly man it was and this man was a good man having goodly parent godly parents he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord now we find that usually I think today our great problem of what we believe to be juvenile delinquency as parent delinquent a home delinquent so he's going from children to parent within the home is delinquent right how people got away from the things that they should have stayed with the church got lukewarm or cold and the children got out into the world why would that be because the influence of the believers became no because the church became lukewarm why is that happened because it became established and the people relaxed in the wrong because now we're established now we have a church order now we've been here a few years now everything's established now we can relax honor that is the time when the enemy comes in because we get used to a certain way of doing things and a certain way of service goes amen in a certain response from the people you follow me and we get you it becomes a culture and then we have church lunch a certain way and we eat certain things we do certain things it becomes a culture now there's good things and there's bad things I'm not saying throw it all out and start again but I'm saying now you've got to be careful this is the time or you know well we're well we've gone through yeah we've been down this road a few years you got to be careful you must not leave your first love I mean because if you maintain your first love for him then you'll never get stagnant you'll never become lukewarm you'll never backslide amen and that was the first problem that the church faced in the in the Ephesian age now has left thy first love and to me I believe that would have been one okay let's just forget about that are predestinated to do it the enemy came in paul said i fought the beast ephesus they're false teachers came in and perverted the word and as false brethren came in unawares and there was fighting within the believers walk in that course a loss of first love i mean if it's not doubt worth right in the hearts of the people that can cause them to lose their first love because now their walk is now out of against that guy hey with me against that guy instead of lord i love you you're my everything how glorious you are so now we don't want to go down that way and that's why the enemy will come in and he'll try and split he'll try and put brother against brother Charlie gainst child sister against sister he'll try and split the church up in some certain way because it breaks the love one for another because offense has come and offenses welcome amen it just it'll just happen brother Graham says you know you're one big sweet humble group but he'll come in he'll bring someone and shoot them with something a poison will go through everywhere if you let it happen amen and you can go back and you can see that's exactly what happened Amen you can go to Jeffersonville you can go to Tucson all these places wherever the wherever the work you go you even go Paul said after my departing grievious wolves among you will come in and rend the flock I've warned you about of about three years this is going to happen and it happened amen he say well but we're in the message so were they they received the message from God under the star of their age which was Paul they were message believers back then for their age Oh this'll never happen to us no history repeats itself but now here's the challenge now can we overcome can we overcome by divine love look beyond the fault of the brother of the sister or the child look beyond their fault can we look beyond it I pray in God's grace we can I mean this dog encounter we cannot fight these battles the same way our forebears fought it amen this great rifts in this country because people fought it the wrong way out of good intentions brother Graham says that people get so zealous for the denomination that actually splits our Brotherhood and people can be so zealous for this stand in the wrong way it can split up Brotherhood amen now the church got lukewarm or cold and the chill chill dronov into the world now Hollywood puts out a lot of movies and television and so forth it's even uncensored now you take that in 1964 and you take that today it's a billion times it's a billion times worse now than it was then yeah amen it must be a greater power in God and you Amen I'm talking about parents now I'm talking oh this should be a such an influence in your life why do we do this mommy daddy we love him he purchased our salvation he's glorious to us I mean I was lost and I'm done you don't have to go down that way you don't have to receive those Scouts I want to see what it's like there's nothing good out there hallelujah it's always the world never shows the emotional scarring that it causes it never shows it because of it if Hollywood showed the damage for psychologically it does emotionally it does they'd never sell a single film they would never ever sell a single film if they showed the damage that it caused why do you see actors and they die young or they go from relationship to relationship to relationship to broken home to divorce divorce divorce on drugs died from drug you know there's some people and they're at the height of their fame and they die they have to try to find peace by something they cannot find it because they're drowning in dark but yet outwardly look at me I'm successful if Hollywood showed the dark side of it what it causes it wouldn't sell a single thing right and you say you can't you've got to look at it for what it is you say that's being legalistic or whatever it no it's not you got to look at it for what it is and say I will have no part in that thing but that will not bring you all it what does it give children nightmares why does it give them nightmares because it's not right you ever seen you know thinks things that give children like me something either they're too young for it or something's wrong with it amen I remember seeing some movies growing up and it terrified me and one was one was a book by Roald Dahl made as a movie who knows we're old dollars yeah terrified freaked me out well why cause it wasn't I won't go down that way but it wasn't normal and then nowadays they make it hyper realistic what's happening the imagine the dark and imagination of man is becoming flesh becoming material in front of us amen and if that's the case and the negative so much before the mind of God is becoming material is becoming flesh among us hallelujah you got to think about it and so it's even uncensored that they cursed God use God's name in vain and it used to be wrong for children and holiness churches to go to go to picture shows and now Satan got one jump ahead to bring it right into the house in the form of television and then uncensored and so forth and that Satan's way of gradually entering in you really got to pray over what you allow your children to look at yeah you say well it won't affect me and it may not but it affect them you'll see a hood you just take a natural you take like a herd of zebras or buffalo whatever it is wildebeest what do the Lions normally go for they go for the young or they go for the old right they got waste go cuz that's the week targets what a satan go for he'll go for the young always go for the young because the young are not emotionally spiritually strong enough or even a mostly to comprehend it what he's doing amen and he's like a lion walking about seeking whom he will do to devour so you've really got to think well this won't affect me and there may not but what's happening to little Johnny what's happening to Susie yes Amen because you can see something and it's so engrained into your mind that you can never forget it and it can just be a few seconds I wonder you think about this he says it's like the old toboggan slide used to be mean but we are a Holiness Church is that okay we are separated unto God hallelujah to the lamb I'm a king and priests to God but the blood has brought me in it's not a bunch of the house shall keep all there's no Lord you have separated me unto yourself hallelujah I'm glad I don't belong to the devil I'm glad I'm not his punching bag anymore Amen that's the way of Satan's way I've gradually come again like the old toboggan slide used to be many of you don't remember it because you're too young used to have entertainment for children you sit down on your toboggan and you must move around and around and there's a hole a chute and if I'm with dear one another would go closest to it and after a while before you knew down your wheat that's the way sinners don't travel with it don't see how close you can get to it see how far away you can stay away from it see I mean don't take no chance if you're going it's like if there's a bomb in this place would you want to go close to it and look at it pick it up see what's good you'd run of course you'd run that makes perfect sense but you take sin and oh look at it number closer come back and just maybe oh this is not doing me damn it boom where did he go I don't know a million pieces I'm not trying to make a joke this how people are well look at this I'll never succumb to that well why are you trying to expose yourself to it like this no water the nature is gonna be changed Fred Oh deliver me from this Lord I don't want to help me no it's your nature wants it but mentally you know it's wrong what about a new heart you know it's wrong then you won't even go near a man now don't see take no chance if you're going to take a chance I don't want no chance an old Scotsman one time said they're going to cross a mountain and carriages were waiting each man wanting to take him across he said I want the best teams to take me one of them said well I can drive my six head of horses at full gallop within 10 inches of that room around that mountain fall off it's death said I am said I'm a good enough team still I can drive my horses safely around within ten inches my wheels will not fall off maybe this is like how fast can you go to an echo tower a road right this is what basically saying how fast how fast can you get across because if you win over that side you're gone a lot of places right and the other said I can beat that I can drive within six inches or 4 inches never fall off and he said what about you sir he said well I don't know I don't like to do that I hug the bank he said you take me yes amen you take me that's right that's the one it isn't how close you can come and how well you think you're fortified stay just as far away from soon as you can stay just stay as far away as you can say I can do this there's no harm in doing this well if there's a question in your mind don't do it at all anywhere there's a question stay away from it then you see that you're absolutely living by faith if there's no question if there's a question then leave it don't go around it at all and I think that many times it's the parents that get away I know it is sometimes the schools and things Sunday school about half an hour an hour on a Sunday morning and the world has kids the rest of the weekend cram it into their more than a they're more than a teacher and many times too many times the teachers got a little cordially she teaches after while she paints her lips fixes her here and this the children do the best they can and then at home they get no Christian training at all mother's out somewhere to a card party days down the bowling alley and sisters out with somebody with a hot rod here you are see where did we go where did we go you just it's terrible and then we find out these these things together jr. beating up and down the road on his motorcycle at some of them down playing golf others playing pool and it's just something something another for entertainment and the churches let go what's happening influences government many times they get aboard their if the pasta would hit a little wire that's kind of little country say something about that board will have him up his name would go up to headquarters he be excommunicated you see it's a real meal ticket and instead of an anointed servant of God to preach the gospel that's right it becomes a thing that they wanted to meal ticket they got to stay there get good pay listen brother God have mercy upon a man that would sell his birthright for that we need a man who handle the gospel barehanded not with any kind of denominational glove or just lay it out in the way it is and let the chips fall where they want if the shoe fits mummy used to say wear it if it don't trim your corn now so we see these things that we ought to be listening to this King Uzziah being such a wonderful child he will had a godly father his mother came from Jerusalem and a godly father who was king before him and that kind of teaching melted into that boy right so it's not a it's not a surprise he turned out the way he did was that teaching melted into that boy he says I'm neither Democrat nor Republican I made one vote that was for Christ and I'm going to win on that now I think the greatest president though we ever had was Abraham Lincoln not because he was a Kentuckian too but because that the man came out from nothing and all the books the man ever owns from the time he was young until he was of age almost was the Bible and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress see that molded into him what that he was Honest Abe see what you read what you do mold your character amen it tells what you are and now we see he read where if you did wrong he paid for it if you did right God would honor it and that molded what he was and his mother was a godly woman too he said if there's any credit given anybody it was a godly mother that raised him right now it's made I think I'd say at least one if not the greatest president we ever had he came up from nothing and God made him president because he was an honest man and he was a good man and we and we and we know from history when he came off the ship there and one of the southern states and he saw a slave market and and people being sold as slaves something struck him saying I'll hit that thing even if it costs my life I mean and we know that it ultimately cost his life because he was assassinated I mean but but his character it was molded into him in such a way that when he saw men and men and women and slavery being sold as just like cattle something's trying to say I'm gonna put it into this a mint and it should be the same thing with you and I I mean when we see sin rampaging on every hand I mean we should bail the seat is a greater way then but we should be we should just be against things remember the gospel is for where to earnestly contend for the faith that was once given to the Saints I mean so we should be for the Lord Jesus Christ we should be for holiness we should be for pure lives under fire before yo you know before the Lord we should before the Holy Spirit moving we should before people being birthed into the kingdom and then we should be for joy and speakable and full of glory amen we should be for perfect peace ain't with me I mean with me we should be for God coming down and visiting us wherever we are we should be for those things not just against things and those are the things I'm contending for I am for our people being molded into His image Alleluia but that was the influence upon his life those two books Maldon ermine - what he was allelujah you say well that's not too great these kinds of days I'd say it doesn't matter what form it comes in I wanted an HD 3d virtual reality and then I'll do it no I'd forget about that I'd say give me this give me the Word of God give me living testimonies what do you want to mold you what do you want to be well I want to be an astronaut one day well forget about that what do you want to be as a person because ultimately what defines us is not our job what defines us is our character I mean that's what we'll be remembered for is a life that we left so what do you want to mold you now the attitude of the parents as amplified as I said in the very beginning what our parents what our children pick up from others what our children pick up from us is more the what we do not say but what we do the more them all then what we say right and so the attitude of the parents is amplified or magnified in the children you can see this in you know with with Elijah or Elijah whether we're 42 children came out made fun of him go up bald head go up and those and the Prophet and anger curse those children and to two she bears came out and killed them but where did they get that attitude from by the Ramseys at one place maybe the parents did that at home so it's just even just a saying there in the home it became their whole attitude so that's what molded them to go out and say that I'll be done soon maybe I won this up actually he says now so the attitude of the parents towards our Lord Jesus Christ his word will be passed down and that is the adage because it's all about our attitude and approach is the most important thing so if we are indifferent if we are indifferent towards God I'm just going the negative way if we are indifferent towards God again you're about as word odd doesn't matter I you know God just loves us I can do whatever we want it's not that important you know that will be passed down to the children right in a greater way but then if we reverence him if we love him if we you know if we have the right mental attitude God is always right he is always in control turn to him first let's pray about this let's seek his mind about this we love him he's so wonderful to us thank you for a glorious thank you for another wonderful day Lord praise your great name you're so good to us thank you we have life from these bodies to praise you amen you know if you have that kind of attitude Lord your word is so pure Amen it's the most valuable thing women we're the most blessed people at all the earth because we walk with the true and living God that'll be in them amen brother ham says and expectations he says is a few places maybe I'll just read this one an unchangeable God working in an unexpected way 1962 why the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass and feel just look at it and take care of the word just right because the infinite god spoke it god's word jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away oh how we ought to rest upon that divine promise of the Son of God who said both heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away there is a resting place for the soul now jesus said in the word jesus said if you ask the father anything of my name I'll do it but sometimes when God performs something does something what we asked yet we yet we don't it comes in an unexpected way and sometimes in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time but God will answer in his own way if you'll just believe it see you must believe it accept it then don't take it back hold on to it lay hold of it and say this is it God see that that settles it if God said so it's finished no matter how long we should instill that into our children God is always right he's always in control amen his promises are true and though it may tarry it will not it will come and he will guide our steps he is our Shepherd he's leading us through good times and bad times I meant you know brother Barrett now I'm sorry that it's running late but brother Brad speaks a lot about home life and home life is more than at his home life is not having the nicest house on the nicest Street with the nicest everything that is not home life home life is talking about family the family unit and the culture and the you know I'd say there's a culture a good culture is a good thing amen a good way of life there there was a good way to live and he talks about home life and he says in some places how home life is now running into shallow water so it's coming to an end right but if home life is strong then the family will move with the Lord and that's what we want right so now he speaks no I just read a couple of these I'll just jump a few things down you see he says and meanest man and this isn't Santa Maria he said now I want to tell you something about Sunday School it's absolutely wrong to send your children to Sunday School you know that take them take them to Sunday school I say God bless you all for taking your children Sunday school because you go with them right now seen a little cartoon in the paper not long ago was amazing a little boy came to the door he showed his mother in his father's bedroom bottles laying on the floor cigarette pieces and everything in his way up and the day 9 o'clock and the little boy had dawn got up washed himself combed his hair put on his clothes knocked on the door said hey who's going to take me to Sunday school there you are that's just the way the American trend of it is isn't it awful I think the modern American people now this is the same this is a problem with the West remember we have too much we have too much we are always connected we have to be always connected apparently I mean your boys got to have your phone on you apparently it's got to be charged you got to have Wi-Fi you've got to have data if you do not have data or or anyway if it's just that I don't have it here but if it's just something that's out of battery and you can't connect the world it's bad who says it's bad but this is this is this is the culture of the Western world now you got to be connected you got to see what's going on on Facebook what's going on on whatsapp maybe if you do Twitter or whatever else that goes on you know it's got to be you've got to be in tune with what's going on there do you do you really what did we do before we had smartphones did we exist that we survived that the world keep going what did we do before cellphones that the world go on was it all okay did we survive what did we do before the internet Oh amen what do you mean you got a heavens in it who says you got to heaven to live but you see all these things because I read this and say well as about mum and dad being you know having beer bottles stuff in their room and cigarettes and stuff but it's but it's more than that now you say well my parents don't drink or smoke or whatever more yeah but we can be caught up in this digital world leave me sir and what's the first thing that goes so brother Bram says the most powerful weapon that God has placed in the hands of man is prayer prayer changes things amen prayer changes the mind of God sometimes that's in the scripture I mean was it his a car you saw I think he's a car he was sick to death Isaiah comes and thus saith the Lord you're gonna die set your house in order you gonna die and he turns to the wall he prays Lord I've lived with the right heart before you give me more time and then Isaiah's back at his house God speaks to him go tell the king he's got 15 more years turns his heart maybe an Abraham saying their book yeah before Sodom and Gomorrah is gonna be Bernie talks to God but what have you finding 50 will he spirit yes I will what if he find 40 he keeps going down and down and down what he's tried turning changed the mind of God Moses are standing there God says I'm gonna wipe out these people I'm gonna start with you yeah he stands in the breach hallelujah changes God's mind think about it hallelujah it's the most powerful weapon all of the nuclear arsenal in the world is nothing compared to a believer with free amen it is nothing that is not it's not even on the same scale it's the most powerful but what is the thing that always goes first in a Christian walk prayer why is it well I've got to check this and I've got to check this email I've got to respond to this person this person this person this person I've got to do this and this and this and you've got your whole other things you're gonna take care of in life oh now it's about 1:30 in the morning our need to sleep well did you need to do all those things but they're expecting an answer are they what if you don't answer them or the world description and break but I have to do you know I'm not trying to sound ridiculous but you got to think about it I have to get back to this person really you know sometimes I long for the days wouldn't it be nice you just send a letter I want here I won't hear from them for about a year maybe yeah that's not and then it's like oh I've got time now you know sometimes you know you drive look you know sometimes I've driven along in the evening here and the sky is just blood-red every every shade it's incredible just the you know off the clouds everything and then you look at that and you look down it's just houses and light song people and I was just thinking and they're probably looking at this HD TV or running around their rat race I'm just thinking I would love a house we just had a big panoramic view and you saw sunset let's turn on the TV just open the curtains and then if and then if you're above the lights you just see stars wouldn't that be nice putting that be good okay Oh what are you doing tonight it's a clear sky I'm just gonna look I remember going to Vanuatu up the northern island Mata lava they have nothing they have generators but half them don't work there's no power they've got cellphone coverage there thank you did you sell leave them well no they they put them everywhere but you're there at nighttime and it's just just just stars greater than anything I've seen in this country even down in the South Island stars and stars you see that you just see everything and you just get like a sore neck because you just want to just steer it it bit just going about their their night you know doing their thing wow that's the greatest thing and then if they came here and they may be setting a big cinema or saying that's their wars and that incredible that's not that's incredible I mean well what do they do all day not too much but they're happy why they are and they would want our life no we really want their life because at least they're content Oh what do you have to do today well I've got to dig this garden I got to go fishing I'm gonna do are you in a hurry now I'm not in a hurry just think about it but then we're running from sunup till sundown the first thing we normally check in the morning is our cell phone who sent me this who's emailed me here - that's the first thing we do would it really would the world really end if you didn't answer in the morning you know prayer is the most powerful weapon are we using our weapon you know what we singing I'm in the Lord's army you know I sing about a war you know you fire artillery you just don't fire a warning shot now we're gonna vaporize those guys we're gonna deal with their enemy I mean you don't just fly over take some potshots how you doing ah no no no I can get you know you deal with them amen and here we are with the greatest weapon amen and if your children see you like that then they'll become like that prayer I might just finish there because maybe I should just finish there but now friends let's let's go home now I'm speaking to myself especially let's go home let's think about what we do every day you got to really look at ultimately walk it's between you and God yeah or you and your family this thing does this thing get it you know oh but it's such a good tool yeah absolutely but what else you're using it for oh I need somewhere I need something to escape - glory to God hallelujah praise your name Lord Jesus thank you for another day yeah how do you lead off the pressure again to US presence amen and if any and if you're in there who's in that place of safety I mean I heard letting off the pressure I was walking through pyro mall this week and just thinking about letting off the pressure and brother Brown says in one of those zippers he says he says you're in the house you're in the City of Refuge what are you worrying about brother let off the pressure I mean just let off the pressure I mean if you're in Christ let off the pressure hallelujah this world wants to push this down pushes down please just let off the pressure hallelujah and I'll just have me glorious time going down the escalator holes the holes and shouting but in my heart I'm so happy hallelujah I'm in the City of Refuge I'll say god you're so good amen so what's getting in your way I have to check Facebook do you I've got to go on whatsapp do you really need to respond to that right now what should our priority be amen you know what about our children yo because remember if you've got a good home life where this is center it doesn't mean you always have to sit down and read it you can talk about them you know you can just spend time with your kids talk about how great the laughter's spend some time with them you want them you want I trust is what you want you want God through you to be their greatest influence is that what you want amen so then you've got to say Lord changed my daily life that that is so because we can't just expect this and then they're overcoming mature believers it takes little step by step you take someone who's a surgeon someone training to be a surgeon you would never trust them doing a brain operation on you if they just oh here's the manual how to do a surgery and then now you go do it you wouldn't trust someone like that but so because these hands which to begin with would kill a person they'd do the most incredible surgery the same hands for the knee training and if we look into medical manuals and read things and absorb things and study things and then a few years and do some and have some practical lessons and surgery and then a few years down the road they've got a top of a scale off someone and they're doing all kinds of things the same hands and it's got to be the same thing with us are you with me you understand what I'm saying could be the same thing now we have a manual amen and we want to get that little by little Jesus loves us isn't he good actually Frank you just think of how great let's sing a song you know what we do at home a lot well I try and do it we put on some music off him from here and we'll dance around amen it creates an atmosphere I mean we had there was one of them was going through something from preschool as a spiritual thing put on some put on some music this is a few years ago now we just started dancing around just like that it was gone you can ask my wife about it amen hallelujah God works in different ways but if we just win or do you start clashing and fighting and dududuu sorted out sorted out you know it wouldn't work but if you cried an atmosphere now have a relationship hallelujah music is important I need some musicians come otherwise they'll stand here too long music is very important you say well we're not a musical family you can still fill your house with the right music I mean you'll be amazed with what it does hallelujah so I wanna you say well you out you just throw out a lot of questions I wanted to I wouldn't you think about it what is your home life like is it just busy and everyone's doing their own thing are you about well I guess the average family is four or five in this place ie just five individuals just doing your own thing or your family Union amen you say well I need to have some me time okay why don't you drag your kids into your me time drag your spouse into your me time I do you oh but I need to no no try it amen remember if you do the same thing you'll get the same results okay let's not sit back and say well everything's all cruzi sweet as we have to withstand that thing we're to press the mark of the hike or you say you you know you look at people who are raised in church and they become thank you they meet the Lord they become example believers nine times out of 10 it was the influence of the parents in the right way not a training started spending time created a culture because now remember we've come out of the world many of us we've come out of denomination and now it's the next generation we can't just float along and expect that our kids with God will get a hold of them just like magic I'm sorry use the word but you know we can't just expect you know because it's like an Israel's day God told them if you cleave completely me you'll possess the land and you'll drive out the enemy so when they did that it wasn't shouldn't have been a surprise to them well how did this happen well God actually said if you your whole heart is with me all of your affections everything you are thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul mind and strength and love thy neighbour as thyself other two greatest Commandments a meant so it wasn't a surprise when they drove out the enemy if they did those things so it should be the same thing with us now we we have to our biggest goal should be Lord I want an environment of the Holy Ghost in my life that my children will drop into and eventually one day amen and when they do it should just be a surprise waxey we've been praying for this we've been every day Lord because remember you got to say God catch my family catch my children emfluence them Lord hallelujah and then top of tombi well here you are Here I am send me Isaiah you know he didn't say our Lord yields you know when the crowd for who go for us he didn't say well God you'll take care of it somebody says here I am Lord send me amen they stand shall we I want you to think about say well we're pressing in we're gonna you know don't keep pressing in don't don't sit back and say well no everything's fine we can't sit back and watch the world go by Amen we cannot you we cannot do that in this day and age we should be lord I want to press the battle I want my family to be in an atmosphere you say well they might not accept it but they'll know it's real amen it is up to them because remember every child every man woman and child that comes across God you cannot get in by your by knowing someone else who knows him you've got to know him yourself but at least create an atmosphere where your children will know this is how a daddy should be this is how a father should be and our God is real and he's the true and living God and he changed me he changed mummy he'll change you because a lot of people have walked away previous generations but they all oh this is the truth amen so we need to create an atmosphere where people know this is real it's not out of rules we love Him amen it's just I want to sing um I really want to sing I'm a king a priest to God hallelujah to the lamb I mean by the cleansing of the blood I wanna know it's a fast song I know maybe there's a bit of a let's just worship the Lord a little bit shall we you say well it's been a bit heavy well sometimes we go down these kind of ways I mean but just I trust we like Paul at the end of the road we say I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision so what I was called to be I was not disobedient to it amen in the King David so I'm just gonna throw this and King David was established as king and then he came to a position he says I don't need to go fight no more I don't need to go pray no more I don't need to go out no more he stayed in Jerusalem and then that was the time when he looked out or he's on his palace roof or whatever it was he saw Bathsheba so was when he was established in this kingdom then he let down the guard a little but now I can rest and same thing with us we can't get into spot we say I won't go free I don't need to go pray no more everything's fine you know don't sit back push on that's the time when we should really be pushing on and Nate the Prophet Nathan told David because he done this the sword will not leave your house amen there's Epsilon all those things happen let's not sit back you say well the king knows Venus I'll put it in old language the kingdom has been established everything's fine where our people don't sit back brace the battle I mean I've leave I am [Applause] the older thing [Applause] and I die laughs OH [Applause] I am
