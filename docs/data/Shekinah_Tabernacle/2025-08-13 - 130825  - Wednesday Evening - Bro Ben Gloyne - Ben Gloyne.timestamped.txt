[13:20] required.
[13:22] [Music]

[13:29] through the wings of fear. Your love
[13:33] came into my heart

[13:44] worship
[13:46] where it's all about you.

[19:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thanks. Thank
[19:40] you, Josh. Thank you, musicians. Amen.
[19:42] Good evening, everyone. God bless you.
[19:44] Good to see you still here, Vicki.
[19:46] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[19:48] Let's um turn into the scriptures. We've
[19:50] got prayer uh prayer meeting tonight. We
[19:53] just want to go to um Second Peter
[19:57] chapter 1. Again, I don't have a
[19:59] PowerPoint. Sorry. So, we're going to do
[20:01] this the oldfashioned way.
[20:04] So, second Peter and 1
[20:10] and then we're going to go to um Isaiah
[20:12] 55 as well. So, second Peter 1 and verse
[20:16] 8.
[20:21] Amen. I trust you've all had a good
[20:23] start to the week so far.
[20:26] Everyone's happy. Everyone's good.
[20:29] Yes. Praise the Lord. Amen. First uh 2
[20:33] Peter 1 and8
[20:36] I'm in first Peter. That's not going to
[20:37] help.
[20:38] Let's try that again, shall we? 1 Peter
[20:40] 1 and8. He says, "For if these things be
[20:43] in you and abound, they make you that ye
[20:46] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[20:48] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[20:50] Christ. But he that lackth these things
[20:52] is blind and cannot see a far off and
[20:54] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[20:57] his old sins. Wherefore the rather
[21:00] brethren, give diligence to make your
[21:01] calling election sure. For if ye do
[21:04] these things, you shall never fall. For
[21:07] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[21:09] you abundantly into the everlasting
[21:11] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[21:13] Christ. Wherefore I will not be
[21:16] negligent to put you always in
[21:18] remembrance of these things, though ye
[21:21] know them and be established in the
[21:23] present truth. Amen. And then Isaiah 55
[21:28] and verses 8 to 11.
[21:42] So Isaiah 55 and verse 8.
[21:48] Amen.
[21:50] All right. It says here,
[21:53] "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[21:55] neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[21:57] the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
[22:00] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[22:02] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[22:04] your thoughts. For as a rain cometh
[22:06] down, and the snow from heaven, and
[22:08] returnneeth not thither, but waterth the
[22:11] earth, and maketh it bring forth, and
[22:12] bud, that it may give seed to the sewer,
[22:15] and bread to the eater. So shall my word
[22:18] be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[22:20] shall not return unto me void, but it
[22:23] shall accomplish that which I please,
[22:25] and it shall prosper in the thing
[22:27] whereto I sent it. Amen. Let's bow our
[22:31] heads in a word of prayer this morning.
[22:32] If you have a need, you just want to
[22:33] lift your hands. Say, Lord, don't pass
[22:36] me by this night. Come to where I am.
[22:38] Almighty God, as we bow our heads in
[22:40] your presence, we thank you, Lord. We
[22:41] can come into the middle of the week and
[22:43] we can gather as a people praising and
[22:45] worshiping you, Lord. And truly, Lord
[22:47] Jesus, our desire is to honor you, to
[22:49] worship you with all that we are. So I
[22:51] ask, Father, may you take our lives now,
[22:54] Lord. Cover us in your blood. Forgive us
[22:55] of our sins and our wrongs, our
[22:57] trespasses. And I just pray, dear God,
[23:00] you just give a special grace tonight,
[23:01] Lord. And may you just come anoint your
[23:02] word to our lives, Lord. Anoint speaker
[23:05] and hearer. Anoint those who are
[23:07] listening by the way of the stream as
[23:09] well. Be their portion, dear God. We
[23:11] just want to commit all of our lives
[23:12] into your hands. Have your way. speak to
[23:14] all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's
[23:16] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[23:18] have your seats uh tonight. So, I want
[23:21] to I want to talk a bit about uh and and
[23:23] I pray this all comes together. I was
[23:25] thinking about um Brother Isaac's sermon
[23:29] last Wednesday and about remembering and
[23:31] and I just, you know, and and I just
[23:33] want to kind of follow in that theme if
[23:35] I can have that liberty to do so. Um
[23:38] because we got to really remember God
[23:40] has God has spoken incredible things.
[23:43] And now I'm just going to talk about our
[23:44] local assembly here. Amen. God has
[23:47] spoken incredible things. He's spoken
[23:50] incredible sermons uh at camp. Doesn't
[23:53] matter who's been speaking. God has
[23:55] deposited incredible amounts of word
[23:57] into our lives. He has spoken directly
[24:00] to our hearts. And maybe it's just even
[24:01] a phrase in a service, but it just kind
[24:03] of explodes into your heart. It changes
[24:05] your life. God has done incredible
[24:08] things. Now, we know when God speaks, he
[24:10] doesn't just do it to vibrate sound
[24:12] waves to occupy some sound space. He
[24:14] speaks deliberately on purpose. He, you
[24:16] know, he's got a purpose in doing it. He
[24:18] doesn't speak just to fill sound or fill
[24:21] time. But there's a purpose for it. And
[24:23] we know his word, as Jesus says, the
[24:25] words I speak to you, they are spirit
[24:26] and they are life. So, his words are
[24:29] life, eternal life that goes forth. And
[24:32] they have transformed our lives. They've
[24:33] changed us. I'm sure we can all agree
[24:35] that God has done incredible things.
[24:37] Now, this is why I took this from from
[24:39] from Peter here. He says, "I want to
[24:40] stir you up in remembrance of these
[24:42] things." Because, you know, our God has
[24:44] not left. Amen. He's not departed. He
[24:46] hasn't left us somewhere. You know, our
[24:48] God is still speaking. He's still
[24:50] dealing. He's still working. Remember,
[24:52] he is the great I am. Amen. He wasn't
[24:54] the I was or the will, but he's the
[24:55] great I am. He's the present God. And
[24:57] I'm sure that we can just rejoice a bit
[25:00] tonight just to think about what he has
[25:02] done in our lives and what he's doing.
[25:04] Amen. Because as as we read there in um
[25:06] Peter um you know we had it there where
[25:09] it says this you know that you I was
[25:10] looking into this word now yeah I just
[25:13] pray this kind of comes together but it
[25:15] says that um uh verse 9 here but he that
[25:17] lackth these things is blind and cannot
[25:20] see a far off. Now that word um those
[25:22] words cannot see far off is actually one
[25:24] Greek word which is a compound of two
[25:27] words and one is actually the mysteries
[25:30] you know it's mystery and then the other
[25:32] part is their eyes are closed. So this
[25:34] word meaning they cannot see a far off
[25:36] is they cannot see the mystery of God
[25:38] revealed. They cannot see Christ in you
[25:41] the hope of glory. Right? So we are
[25:43] blessed that we can say we can see. I
[25:46] mean God's word has given us light. He's
[25:48] opened our eyes. I mean our eyes of
[25:50] understanding. It wasn't you or me or
[25:53] anyone that decided I'm going to be a
[25:55] believer and I can see what God has
[25:56] spoken in this day. God sovereignly has
[25:58] come to you anointed your eyes with Isa.
[26:01] open your eyes that you can see what
[26:04] he's doing in this day. That's an
[26:05] incredible thing. Amen. That we have
[26:08] eyes of understanding that we are not
[26:10] blind but we can see. Amen. Because
[26:13] people may look at you when you talk
[26:14] about the very Lord of glory dwelling in
[26:16] flesh and they say that's just too much.
[26:18] But that's Christ in you the hope of
[26:20] glory. I mean it's more than as I said a
[26:21] while a few Sundays ago. It's more than
[26:24] just saying you know a part of God is in
[26:26] you. You know the fullness of all that
[26:28] God is is in his bride. Amen. So, so and
[26:31] and also he says as we read in Isaiah,
[26:33] his word will not return unto him void.
[26:35] So, his word is going to perfect the
[26:37] people. Amen. It will it will make a
[26:40] people fully mature. Amen. We're not
[26:42] going to be adolescent believers. We're
[26:44] going to be fully mature believers.
[26:46] God's word is doing it. Amen. It's not
[26:48] you and I doing it. It's God maturing us
[26:51] through his word. I mean, it's God
[26:52] growing us. God giving us vitamins. God
[26:54] feeding us. God sustaining us. Amen.
[26:57] Till we grow into the stature of the
[26:58] fullness of Christ. Praise the Lord.
[27:01] Amen. Because that's what his word is
[27:02] going to do in this day. And that's what
[27:04] his word has done in this day. Remember,
[27:06] this message is an adoption message.
[27:08] It's a placing message, placing you in
[27:10] your predestinated part of the body of
[27:12] Christ. Amen. I'm so thankful for that.
[27:15] I'm sure you are too. Amen. That
[27:16] remember, it's the word that's doing it.
[27:18] His word. You know, there's a song, his
[27:20] word is working mightily in me. Amen.
[27:23] And I'm sure you've got the testimony.
[27:24] His word is working mightily in me.
[27:27] Amen. It's doing a great work. It's
[27:28] molding me. It's molding my character
[27:30] into his character. Amen. Praise the
[27:32] Lord. So, I just want to I just want to,
[27:34] you know, just a few things that, you
[27:36] know, really struck me. You I was just
[27:37] kind of going down memory lane, you
[27:40] know, today as I was driving down doing
[27:42] the school pickup. I was going down
[27:43] memory lane about what has God done in
[27:45] our midst. You know, he's done a lot.
[27:48] And um one of the things that really
[27:50] jumped out to me is because I've
[27:52] actually got it written down, but you
[27:53] know uh you know you well when we first
[27:56] started you know we uh had the tongues
[27:57] interpretation where the Lord says if
[27:59] you remain humble my word will go forth
[28:01] and I'll bring my people here and
[28:02] they'll find rest for their souls. It
[28:05] was the first prayer meeting we had I
[28:06] think way back in 2012. And then it was
[28:09] just a few years ago when when um when
[28:11] the Lord spoke again in that manner and
[28:13] and he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, my
[28:16] word came forth in this place when you
[28:18] were first began. If you keep humble
[28:20] before me, my word will continue to
[28:22] come. It will find souls and they'll
[28:25] find rest. That is why I have called you
[28:28] today to humble thyself again before me.
[28:31] There are souls that need my rest. You
[28:33] must be humble before me and they shall
[28:36] find their rest. I have not left. And I
[28:39] believe that is still as powerful and as
[28:41] true today as it was a couple of years
[28:43] ago when it was spoken. So it so you
[28:46] know I I think this should really stir
[28:48] us up. Lord, make us humble. Not a not a
[28:51] not a false humility, but a genuine Holy
[28:54] Ghost humility that God can find his
[28:56] people and they can enter rest. Because
[28:58] he says there's souls that must find
[29:01] rest. Amen. And he says if you remain
[29:02] humble, he says he says um it will fi my
[29:06] word will come will continue to come. It
[29:09] will find souls and they'll find rest.
[29:13] Amen. That's amazing. He's saying that
[29:17] his word will find those souls and
[29:19] they'll find that rest. Amen. They'll
[29:21] receive the true sealing of God, the
[29:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. This is
[29:25] a this is a very uh incredible thing
[29:27] where I could say this is one of the
[29:29] mysteries of God. how God and man can
[29:32] unite because in the scripture just
[29:34] going just just referring back to second
[29:36] Peter again with that word cannot see a
[29:38] far off and the word mysteries. So a
[29:40] mystery in the Bible or in the scripture
[29:42] is a previously hidden truth now
[29:44] divinely revealed but uh but in which a
[29:48] supernatural element still remains. So
[29:50] so something that's been hidden it's
[29:52] been revealed and there's a supernatural
[29:54] element in the unveiling. Amen. That
[29:56] will transform a life. So, so we can see
[29:59] we can see a far off. So, we can see the
[30:01] mystery of Christ revealed in you and I.
[30:05] And the supernatural element is that he
[30:07] anoints that word and makes it live in
[30:09] our lives. Amen. He produces himself in
[30:12] a people. Now, just just just going
[30:14] back, you know, I know it's prayer
[30:15] meeting, so I won't be very long
[30:16] tonight, but I just want to stir up our
[30:18] remembrance a bit about some things that
[30:19] have been spoken. I mean, brother Kyre
[30:22] would speak uh quite a few years ago. Uh
[30:24] this is back in Stokes Valley. He
[30:26] preached a sermon called to be
[30:27] continued. How how how the devil never
[30:31] has the final say. You know it's like
[30:33] our life is like a drama and you know
[30:34] there's always if you ever watch like me
[30:36] you watch television you come to the end
[30:38] of an episode and become to a climactic
[30:40] you know dramatic bit and it looks like
[30:43] the enemies you know the bad guys is
[30:44] going to win or something and they just
[30:45] flash across the screen to be continued.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the story wasn't over
[30:50] right. And it's the same thing with our
[30:52] lives. We can come to a point where we
[30:54] just basically like, you know, the
[30:55] Israelites against the Red Sea and it
[30:57] looks like all is lost. But then the to
[30:58] be continued comes along. Why? Because
[31:01] God always has the last say. Amen. The
[31:04] devil never gets the last word. God
[31:06] always gets the last word in everything.
[31:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Camp, you know, I
[31:12] think it was 2019, Brother Kyra again
[31:14] preaching and he had a photo and I
[31:16] couldn't find it, but there was a there
[31:17] was a weed growing in his pastor's
[31:19] backyard. It looked like a tree. It was
[31:21] so big. And this thing was growing there
[31:23] and his wife told him, you know, you
[31:25] should cut this thing down. But he just
[31:27] left this thing growing and eventually
[31:28] it became like a tree and and then and
[31:30] then and then the pastor's dog used to
[31:32] get shade under this weed. And so the
[31:34] pastor reasoned, well, it's it's it's
[31:36] it's should stay there cuz it's looking
[31:38] after the dog. And you know, but then
[31:39] eventually the dog died and the weed was
[31:41] still there. And then eventually, you
[31:43] know, he cut the thing down. But that
[31:45] thing grew for years and years and it
[31:46] should have been gotten rid of. But but
[31:48] but the but he allowed it to grow on his
[31:50] land. And how many times, you know, you
[31:52] may think, "Oh, that's just a nice
[31:53] story." And whatever God was speaking to
[31:55] us, saying, "Don't let things grow in
[31:57] your life. Don't let weeds grow. Don't
[32:00] reason." Cuz reasoning will always
[32:01] protect something. And if you think it's
[32:03] part of you, you'll always allow it to
[32:05] grow there. Amen. But you got to cut
[32:07] that thing out. Not just cut it down.
[32:09] Cut out the roots and everything. Don't
[32:10] let things in your life grow that are
[32:12] not part of the word of God
[32:14] &gt;&gt; because they'll end up as a big problem.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can I can I can trim
[32:19] this thing. I can look after it." know
[32:21] that thing will ruin you. So why not get
[32:23] rid of it? Amen. I to me that's
[32:26] immensely powerful. Amen. We had um you
[32:30] know brother Kyro preach again issues
[32:32] and open doors. The reason we have
[32:34] issues in our lives is because we open a
[32:35] door to the devil. Why not close those
[32:38] doors?
[32:39] Let God seal them over. We don't need
[32:41] issues.
[32:44] Amen. So this is just you know mocking
[32:46] worship. how the how the you know there
[32:49] was a uh the Italian band of soldiers
[32:51] took Jesus and they said they mocked him
[32:53] and they worshiped him putting the crown
[32:55] of thorns on him and all these things.
[32:56] How people can mock God by their worship
[32:58] by not letting their word change them.
[33:01] Amen. Brother Johnny Demoff preaching
[33:02] the three little pigs.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[33:07] then you know
[33:09] um you know brother Kyra again you know
[33:12] I know a lot of these you'd had to be
[33:13] there for the atmosphere but immensely
[33:15] powerful things. You know, you're
[33:17] preaching about how there's all the uh
[33:18] redeemed waiting in paradise and finally
[33:21] the thief in the cross comes through the
[33:22] door and they're under expectation God's
[33:24] going to walk in and then finally the
[33:26] door comes open and the presence of God
[33:27] always precedes him. Amen. And then he
[33:30] physically walked in. Who remembers that
[33:31] kind of thing? See the powerful
[33:33] atmosphere. I remember standing there at
[33:34] the end of that service and you know all
[33:36] the musicians are behind me and and and
[33:38] I said, "Okay, let's let's uh sing a
[33:39] song." And they're just so caught up in
[33:41] worshiping God. I thought, "Well, we're
[33:42] not going to sing tonight." It was so
[33:44] powerful. Amen. But but God was doing
[33:46] those things to remind us, I'm with you.
[33:49] Amen. This is more than theatrics or or
[33:51] or it's not even theatrics, but it's
[33:53] more than just man doing something. But
[33:55] God is trying to deposit something into
[33:56] you. Amen. That his word is true. His
[33:58] word is right. And he's here for you to
[34:00] meet your need. And he's the same
[34:02] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[34:05] Brother Alpha preaching about redemption
[34:06] by blood. Who remembers that service at
[34:08] camp? I mean, many of us were
[34:10] transformed in that service. Amen.
[34:12] Praise the Lord. I'm just wanting to
[34:14] stir up your remembrance. Our God hasn't
[34:16] left. We can get to a point where we
[34:18] forget these things of God moving in the
[34:20] reality of his presence. And you know,
[34:22] we can forget those things. I know I'm
[34:24] guilty of it. Amen. But I just I just
[34:26] want to stir you up a little bit with
[34:28] these things. Amen. We Yeah. Where
[34:30] brother Alpha preached, you know,
[34:31] redemption by blood and many of the
[34:32] young people up and praising God. And
[34:35] who was changed in that meeting? Amen.
[34:37] where you know you know the Lord called
[34:39] out one of the young brothers in church
[34:41] saying you've told a lie and you know
[34:42] make it right with your parents and I'll
[34:44] fill you with the Holy Ghost. Who
[34:45] remembers that? Incredible things
[34:47] happened there. God was telling my blood
[34:49] redeems.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about you know brother Chris
[34:55] Moritz preaching about you know it's
[34:57] bear season.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; It's bear season. We actually have the
[35:00] photo of that one. Well I don't have it
[35:01] here but you know it's on the PowerPoint
[35:02] but anyway, you know it's bear season.
[35:04] So, in other words, God is telling us it
[35:07] is open season on the devil. You can go
[35:09] hunt him if he's on your ground. You've
[35:11] got the sign off. You've got the ride
[35:12] off. You got the ticket. You've got the
[35:14] whatever it is that gives you the lawful
[35:16] right to go hunt a bear. It's bear
[35:19] season. It's open season on the devil.
[35:20] Amen. You have a right to take the word
[35:22] of God, blast them out of the blast.
[35:25] Amen. Kill them, skin them, make him a
[35:27] throw rug on your floor to be a
[35:29] conversation piece when people come into
[35:30] your home. that that a testimony becomes
[35:34] I mean that that an enemy that's been
[35:35] fighting you becomes a testimony in your
[35:37] life. Amen. It is still bear season.
[35:41] That season never closes. Amen. How
[35:44] about when you know when he preached on
[35:45] Abigail in the um Nabal how Abigail was
[35:49] married to Nabal and you know Nabal um
[35:51] means a fool and you know how how
[35:53] someone has to be you know their first
[35:55] husband has to die before they can be
[35:57] you know married to Christ which is
[35:58] David. Abigail's husband Nibal died then
[36:01] so she could marry David. And Nibal
[36:04] means a fool. And our first birth is a
[36:06] full. Our first nature is a fool.
[36:08] This guy's got to die. She can be
[36:11] married to another. Amen. And you know
[36:13] there's many countless more sermons that
[36:15] have been preached that God has been
[36:16] speaking directly on time on point
[36:21] speaking things that people talk about
[36:23] driving to church or talking about or
[36:25] conversations or Sunday school countless
[36:27] times. I wish we could, you know, it
[36:29] probably would have become so common if
[36:31] if you know the Sunday school teachers
[36:32] got up at the end of the service and
[36:33] say, "We just taught that. He just
[36:35] preached it. We didn't talk about it."
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Why? God is trying to get your
[36:39] attention. I mean, he's trying to stir
[36:41] your remembrance. My blood works. I'm
[36:43] here for you. My word is true. Amen. I
[36:46] am more than able to fulfill it. And we
[36:48] can go through the testimonies of
[36:49] supernatural healings and deliverance
[36:51] and all these kind of things. Our God is
[36:53] on time.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to fear nothing. We
[36:57] don't need to worry. I just want to
[36:58] encourage you tonight. God is more.
[37:00] Whatever you're going through, God is
[37:02] more than able. Don't sit there in some,
[37:04] you know, negative slump. That's the
[37:05] devil trying to make you forget what God
[37:07] has done. Cuz remember, if he's if you
[37:10] know, the Lord has spoken to us. He's
[37:12] drawn us. He's saved us. He's redeemed
[37:15] us. Amen. And he's done that. And he
[37:17] can't lose us.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; That's one thing our Lord can't do. He
[37:21] can't lie. And he can't lose one of his.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I'm So so I believe I'm
[37:27] looking at some of his tonight.
[37:29] Amen. So you may be in a valley, you
[37:31] won't stay in the valley. Amen. You may
[37:33] be going through a great fire or river
[37:35] or whatever it is, but God will not
[37:37] leave you there. Amen. Remember, he
[37:39] always he always gives an experience
[37:42] before you go down into a trial like
[37:44] Jesus, you know, Jesus with Peter,
[37:46] James, and John mount transfiguration,
[37:47] right? They're up on the mountain. They
[37:49] have that trans mount transfiguration
[37:51] experience. Then they go down off the
[37:52] mountain and and you know there's
[37:54] problems down in the valley. God equips
[37:57] equipped them before they went down
[37:59] there.
[38:01] Amen. We are never
[38:04] coming up short. Our God is more than
[38:07] able in every single situation.
[38:11] So I just wanted to share those tonight.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Our God has done many things. This will
[38:18] be what be your third anniversary this
[38:21] camp, brother Colin?
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Third,
[38:24] &gt;&gt; second year. He's a witness,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; right? Things we take for granted. Oh,
[38:30] it's camp again and we love it. It's
[38:32] amazing. But someone who hasn't
[38:34] experienced it comes experienced like
[38:36] this is the greatest thing ever and we
[38:37] know it is, right? We got to remember
[38:39] the pillar of fire is very present where
[38:42] where where his word is. Brother Bram
[38:44] says, "The pillar of fire accompanies
[38:45] the message always." Amen. So where the
[38:48] truth of the message is preached, the
[38:50] pillar of fire is there to vindicate
[38:52] that word. Always. Amen. You go to some
[38:56] other places. I've been to Pentecostal
[38:58] churches in Chile. They look like us.
[39:00] They talk like us. They're very
[39:02] wonderful Christian people. But the
[39:03] pillar of fire is not there because they
[39:06] denominated. You know the thing that
[39:07] Isusa Street, there was a common
[39:09] warning. Brother Colin brought this to
[39:10] my attention. Brother Lonnie was
[39:12] teaching and I and I had to Google it to
[39:13] look. But there was a common thing in
[39:15] the June during the ISUsa street
[39:16] revival. There was a warning by the
[39:18] spirit of God. If you denominate, I'm
[39:20] going to leave.
[39:22] That's why we must never denominate. Put
[39:24] a full stop behind what we believe. We
[39:25] got to keep walking in the light and let
[39:27] him unfold his word to us as we walk.
[39:32] Amen. I'm sure I could I could add a lot
[39:34] of, you know, list to these things. you
[39:36] know, monumental seasons and times here.
[39:41] And I believe we're living in a
[39:42] monumental season.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; God is still on the throne in charge
[39:46] working in our lives. But I just want
[39:49] you to just maybe this week go think
[39:50] back. Think back in your Christian walk.
[39:54] Make a list.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Make a I tell you what, you'll be
[39:57] dancing after a while,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; but make a list of what he has done,
[40:00] what he has spoken. You say, "I need a
[40:02] big book." That's fine. Get a big book.
[40:04] But take a take take stock about what he
[40:07] has done. We're all from different parts
[40:09] of the world. God didn't start here,
[40:11] right? God started wherever you started
[40:12] because he's always been with you,
[40:13] right? But take stock about what he's
[40:15] done. I tell you what, your faith will
[40:18] go through the roof. Cuz what he
[40:20] started, he will perfect. He will
[40:21] complete in the day of Jesus Christ. He
[40:23] won't leave you half done. Right? He
[40:25] never leave us in the wilderness. We
[40:26] We're promised lamb babies. Amen. In
[40:29] Christ, in the son of man, living in our
[40:31] inheritance.
[40:33] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you can
[40:35] see? Aren't you glad God's word will not
[40:38] return to him void? Amen. This bride
[40:40] will be produced exactly how he ordained
[40:42] it in his word without spot or wrinkle
[40:44] or any such thing. That's you. Praise
[40:47] the Lord. Amen. Let's um let's have the
[40:49] musicians. I just wanted to
[40:53] share that with you tonight. He's done
[40:56] great things.
[40:58] Amen.
[41:03] How many answered prayers have we had
[41:05] from these prayer meetings? How many
[41:07] countless prayers God is? You know, it
[41:11] it always makes me feel this big when I
[41:13] think about God is sovereign. God's not
[41:15] a democracy. Not all the lobbying in the
[41:17] world can make a move. He's not some
[41:20] crooked politician. He's sovereign. So,
[41:22] if he chooses to do something, he does
[41:23] it.
[41:25] So, I'm so thankful for our God. He
[41:27] would listen to you and I listen to me.
[41:29] I mean, it's the blood that, you know,
[41:30] puts us on speaking terms, right? It's
[41:32] all his doing. He wants us in his
[41:34] presence and more than we want to be in
[41:36] his presence. But you think about the
[41:37] countless testimonies and prayers
[41:39] answered and God undertaking, not just
[41:42] for people here, but around the world.
[41:44] We're we're such a I mean, he's so good.
[41:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's let's
[41:51] stand, shall we? I want to sing the song
[41:53] um goodness of God and then we'll go
[41:56] through the prayer request and we'll
[41:57] have a time of prayer.
[42:00] Amen. I've lived in the goodness of God.
[42:03] I'm still living in his goodness.
[42:06] Amen. I love you, Lord,
[42:12] for your mercy never fails me.
[42:16] [Music]
[42:17] All my days
[42:20] I've been held in your hands.
[42:25] From the moment that I wake up
[42:29] until I lay my head.

[42:35] in the goodness
[42:38] of God.

[43:22] and in darkest night.

[43:30] I've known you as a father.
[43:34] I've known you as a friend.
[43:38] I have lived in the goodness
[43:43] of God. All my love
[43:47] [Music]
[43:48] and all my life you have been faithful.
[43:56] All my life you have been so so good.
[44:04] With every breath that I am able,
[44:10] I will sing
[44:12] of the goodness
[44:15] of God.
[44:17] [Music]
[44:19] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's
[44:23] running after me.
[44:28] Your goodness is running after. It's
[44:31] running after me.
[44:34] With my life laid down, I surrender now.

[45:53] of God.

[45:57] seats tonight. Amen. Thea's got a
[45:58] testimony she'd like to share. You want
[46:00] to come up?
