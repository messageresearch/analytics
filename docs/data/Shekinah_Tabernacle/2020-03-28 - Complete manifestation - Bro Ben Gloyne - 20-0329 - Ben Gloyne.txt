you friends you may have your seats this morning I mean I'd like to if I could take a I can take a a title or I'd like to speak about a full manifestation I want to continue so I just go down maybe just hold my notes like this but I want to continue along the thought that I was I was I was speaking on on on Wednesday and I just pray that you know as as this time goes along or as as long as you know we are walking in this earth with the Lord that he would just anchor into our hearts the reality of what we have you know a greater reality you know we see as the world is locking down and and you know you're the you know the beast power is taking over the world and trying to shut the Christians down and all these you know change the economics of the world and do all those things you know I trust that as we see that become a reality that we should see what we have as a reality as well I mean so you know you know brother brems says in the field he says this he says you see these things that we are now that we're studying right now is after the churches gone to speaking of the Great Tribulation see these things in the period and I think it ought to be truly settled in every believers heart at this church never takes a tribulation period cannot put know where the church and the tribulation now is gonna clarify this now he says you put the church there but not the bride see the bride has gone on cuz see she has not one sin not a thing against her the grace of God has covered her over and the bleach has took every sin so far away there is even a remembrance of it not not a thing but purity perfect in the presence of God oh it ought to make the bride get down on her knees in order to cry out to God holier for us to realize with is not once and held against us yeah yeah hey on Calvary you know he took all of our sin our iniquity I mean our secret false everything that could be held against us he carried that out Calvary way and is not one thing held against the Bride of Christ I mean we are as God as pure were as perfect as God is perfect not because of our own selves and what we can do but it's what he has done that matters [Applause] hallelujah so I think you know they ought to make us just drive us to our knees and praise God hallelujah I mean there's such a wonderful thing so I pray as we continue journeying on that will become a greater reality you know it's amazing it seems such a paradox in this day where we're at season Isaiah 60 and one you know brother bran would preach the message Shalom from these myths scriptures but where it says a rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon me for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall raise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee now that that scripture is alive today that even when the prophet stood upon the earth and preached Shalom because we know when a prophet speaks something he sees it in its full manifestation even though when he is standing upon the earth just be in seed form so even even when brother brand would preach that you know the Holy Ghost was was moving more freely among churches you know God was you know in the church drum he was doing a lot of things but you know and when there be a disaster people would call upon God but nowadays it seems that no one calls upon God no more there's no even there's not doesn't even seem to be an anger against him why does he allow this and you know how it used to be just a few years ago it's like the idea of God has truly left the people's minds they're not even aware that he's upon the earth I mean so so we can see unsaddle II a gross darkness does cover the earth does cover the people but as it is so dark but yet is also so light Amen there's never been a light that shines so bright as in this thing when the darkness is only there in the absence of light so if light is there darkness cannot stand in the presence of light so it must it must flee Amen it's you because darkness is just the absence of light it's not a power in itself I mean but we see that gross darkness covers the people but I mean the glory that was risen upon us our light is shining hallelujah so it's such paradox where this great darkness but yet great light at the same time you know it's incredible I was I was just looking and you know yeah I know it's trending at the moment but this but because of this virus covert 19 I read on a on a website science alert calm it's estimated that 2.6 billion people or around 1/3 of the world's population are under some form of lockdown right now oh one third of the world's population is restricted at its movement in some form right now so one you could say one third of the world is shut down I mean and that of course will have great ramifications on the economy as we're era as we're aware of but you know it just goes to show that the world is falling apart everything that people have held on so dear for material things and wealth and prosperity those things that just put a vapor and they're gone I mean there's a people upon the earth that they're not looking to the things that are seen but things that are unseen I mean the eternal things I mean I mean so now we read in Luke 21 because I want you on y'all you know I just want to point out a couple of things I can see it now he spoke of them a parable of the fig tree and all the tree so he's saying it's not just when the fishery put forth its buds but when all the trees put forth their buds now we know from the scripture that that the fig tree it speaks of Israel as a nation blooming forth again you know we don't have time to read it but you go read Jeremiah 24 and this and and Jeremiah sees a vision of two baskets of figs and the interpretations given in that in that chapter that they're actually the people of Israel and we know a tree doesn't only speak of a person but speaks of a nation so he says when you see the fig tree put forth its buds and all the tree so it's not just it's not just Israel as a sign but it's them and everything else and we can see in this day that you know everything as as putting forth its buds it's growing his prey its bearing fruit I mean where it was just in a seed for maybe when the Prophet was here now it's come to its maturity you know the tears have come to their maturity the bride has come to her maturity you know we're living in a day of full manifestation I mean all that the word is is now being being being made flesh but I want you just to just just hold it in your heart where where Jesus would say heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away so so he's saying that that has he said heaven earth can change they can go away they can pass away but his words could not so if his words cannot pass away they will manifest exactly what they're intended to manifest now I know if probably you know you know I've spoken on these things you know in the past but I just wanted to become a greater reality Oh hallelujah so no no brother brand makes a statement now I'm gonna get to David I mean cuz I see it you know y'all read the scripture that he was gonna be anointed and I'm gonna come to him as a context but you know he sees in the message Church of the Living God in 1951 he says listen close any redemptive blessing that's written in the words now there's no need of you arguing of it whether it's in the atonement if it's in the word God a sovereign and has to fulfill his word for heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away he says if God said so God is worth no more than his word and if his word is no good then he is no good if your word if you can't put no confidence on what you say you're no good but you're just as good as your word is and God is just as good as his word us and I as a Christian believer I believe that this Bible is inspired it's written by the Holy Spirit and it is the infallible Word of God and God is under obligation to his word to the believer that will accept this word and any word as a seed if you're accepted in your heart by faith and believe it and confess it God will bring it to pass I mean so God is obligated to his word he has to fulfill it now we got to understand when God said Let there be Sun Moon and stars he you know or when God made any promise he never changed that promise he never diluted that promise he never said oh I didn't mean that just you know just if the circumstances got harder or it appeared like it was impossible that it would ever happen he didn't say no I didn't mean that I was just joking I just you know I had a funny day that's why I said that no he what he says he means and if he means it and he says it I mean he has to fulfill it doesn't matter how impossible it seems or how how unlikely it will ever be that's irrelevant I mean if God said it would be it will be hallelujah see so he doesn't back up he doesn't you know the devil challenges his word God doesn't back up on that challenge he says evil I'm gonna manifest my word in the midst of you it doesn't matter what you try and do about it it's gonna happen hallelujah so now he says in the Misses perseverant he says god's word can't fail he has never failed and he can't fail that is one thing God can't do that's failed he cannot fail and God is his word so that's one thing God can't do he can do all things but why doughnuts fail amen and he's not gonna fail now if he never failed in the beginning he can't fail now because he's the great unchanging God Ilia so he never failed in the beginning and he never failed in the middle he can't fail at the end because he's lying God changed me I mean everything he was when he created all things he's the same God today everything he wasn't the prophets he's the same God today everything he wasn't he's just Christ the days of his flesh he's the same God today I mean everything he was in the prophets ministry he's the same God today hallelujah so we must have confidence heavens and earth will pass away but my words could not pass away and then his word cannot fail hallelujah it's impossible god don't change his mind about his word he has never backed up a watered-down a promise or change a promise because of circumstances gets too hard or impossible for his word to be fulfilled he cannot fail Amen that no that should be out yo the first thing in the morning God you cannot fail hallelujah amen glory doesn't matter how dark the world gets he cannot fail he's gonna stop them now you can stop nothing will stop him a man we're gonna have that confidence God nothing can stop you yes sir lorry now brother bran would would would speak about dry sand and the message lifting him up out of history and to me it's one of my favorite messages and driest when you know we know dry his his only child his daughter was second and then and then he saw the doctors couldn't help her so so so brother Brown says it wasn't dry as his house where the doctors had failed and turned the little girl back to die and death had come in and taken its bit of toll and had taken the only child the home the little girl of 12 and stretched her out on a couch when a brokenhearted little preacher had to forsake his denomination and all of his friends but he remembered that there was a God of history who could raise the dead and he went to find him I lost and he went to find him hallelujah seek and ye shall find knock and he'll be opened unto you ask and it will be given unto you he is still the same God as God dwelling in a body called Jesus the Son of God when he was called on the scene called up out of history the God who could raise the dead in the Old Testament could bring back life to a dead baby through a prophet that God cannot die for he is that He is God for eternity it may be laying there on the bed stretched out a little driest knowing that the shunammite got her baby back he said that god of history if he could ever be called into action he's the same God today and searching through he had heard of some man that claimed to have the power that was Jesus of Nazareth who they all hated but he called him on the scene for he was the closest represent then tative representative uh he could find of God at that day a God of the Living God and when he was called on the scene and the historical God was called up he acted the same way he did when he spoke to Elijah on that dead baby let me say more let me more say today my brother's sister in this present day when crisis when cancer is eating the world up and diseases of all kind the same historical God that cleanse a leper healed the sick raise the dead is the same God today he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the scene of action amen one who could forgive a harlot for committing adultery seven times a day he who could cleanse the vilest sinner and make him white as a lily that same God of history lives today to clean every blackened heart of sin and unbelief and call them out Amen in this time of crisis hallelujah call them on the scene Amen call what I've seen for yourself and for your family he's waiting for you to call him on the scene God's Word cannot change because it's eternal as God is eternal because he is his word it's amazing we take for granted when we read the scripture where it says in the beginning was the word and the word was was with God and the Word was God amen just the reality that God is his word divine promise I mean the right mental attitude to it towards any divine promise of God will cause it to come to pass and he means the right mental attitude towards us towards God's Word God your word says all happen I mean you promised this to me cause it to come to pass I mean we should never pardon me we should never have the attitude or maybe it will happen or maybe it could work we should have the attitude Lord you've done it before you'll do it again in a few you know if you're feeling worried and down I mean just begin to read through the description everything that God has done I mean begin to listen to some prayer lines begin a list of the testimonies of the believers I mean you'll begin to realize our God is alive if there's no way he's not dead he's not he's not sleeping someplace he's alive today hallelujah a man I'm looking for the full manifestation of third pulled myself we're shut away that you're the prophets and it won't be a public show I mean maybe I just get too excited I don't know I mean we should believe for things that man cannot do I mean God steps in and doesn't allow circumstances in life from us to realize I mean God allows it that we come to a spot where we come to the end of ourselves and we come to our wits in that's when God can step on the scene amen and Psalms 119 verses 89 and 90 it says for ever O Lord thy word is settled in heaven my faithfulness is to others unto all generations thou has established the earth and it abideth so he's telling us that his word has settled forever in heaven amen hallelujah God's Word is settled in heaven it's already done I mean it you know you're as far as God thinks yo yo it's got you as far as God sees you he sees you around the throne and redeem remember he's eternal he's outside of time I mean remember we are creatures of eternity just having to have an experience in time I remember this world is not our home we are just passing through that into our souls I mean rapture is us just going home after this brief journey upon the earth praise the Lord thank you know to speak just on God not failing in terms of healing salvation and deliverance is only half the picture but I want to speak more about today of the prophetic side of God's Word I mean so it so it's easier to say yes he's a healer and yes your although all those divine promises but when it comes to God's prophecy when he has spoken something forth I mean that cannot read that cannot fail you know as it would say in Isaiah that you know that my word will not return unto me void a mean but it will accomplish that which our purpose sent it to do it means for now so let's just take our opening scripture I mean that we read about about Samuel going to Jesse's house oh he told God told God told Samuel I have a king prepared for me among Jesse sons when when when God told Samuel to go down to Jesse's house he already knew that David would be anointed king so when God gave that promise to 2 Samuel and God's mind was David right and God's mind was David upon the throne that was part of that promise right so when God when God promises anything he already knows exactly who's going to fulfill it right he doesn't just throw a promise out there like behold a virgin shall conceive and it's like a lolly scramble and the right person grabs it now now the promises there's no it doesn't work that way I mean when God speaks a promise forth he knows exactly who will fulfill that promise and nothing can stop that person fulfilling that promise hallelujah I mean nothing can stop them fulfilling that promise so when God said through Isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive I mean and God's mine Mary was their fulfillment of their prophecy right I wonder if anyone it was Mary it was one woman that was going to manifest that promise hallelujah so when samuel was told by God to go to Jesse's house I meant God knew that David was going to fulfill their promise hallelujah I mean even even when when God would speak to Jeremiah and in the first words that the Lord ever spoke to Jeremiah was before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations so God is telling Jeremiah and I think you know I was thinking about Jeremiah's life he was living in a great time of change by the end of his life Jerusalem would be destroyed the the other nation would be carried away captive he was living in a time when the world was falling apart and he had to stand there in the gap and called to Israel no matter what they did with the word no matter what what they rejected didn't matter he had to stand there in that time I mean and he had to speak a word to the people to try and get them to turn back to God and and because he lived in such perilous times I believe that's why told him before you're in your mother's womb I ordained you for this job I ordained you for this purpose Jeremiah you're you you're already my prophet before you're conceived even before your parents thought of you I thought of you and I'll show you when this office is a prophet and it's not that maybe you'll you'll become one you already are one I mean he's gonna skip into your role and home and fulfill the Word of God that's been allotted to you and that's the same thing with us friends it's not a lujah amen so he had to tell them it and and I believe that's why we're living you know why why God would would place us under this eagle anointing where we could see from eternity to Eternity is that we would be able to stand in this parallel stay where we can see that we came from God and we go back to God and and that should give us such a stability in our walk wholly the reason that I believe this message is because I'm part of this word I mean I didn't just maybe this haphazardly even though many times we think God you know we just stumbled into this thing we didn't stumble into this thing hallelujah saw before we were ever conceived amen before we're ever in our mother's womb he or dangerous to be the Bride of Christ amen let's just enjoy the ride to get there again hallelujah I mean God gave gives a promise to Abraham I'm just wanting to show this to you because you know we we have to just remember God predestinated us to a position mmm his word will not return unto Him void right his word cannot return unto Him void so if he has predestinated us to that position we're gonna get there now thinking member nothing can stop God's Word nothing can hand yo sure the devil try and hinder the devil try and stop you but God will get you there now we read here in Genesis 15 and verse 13 and he said unto Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterwards they shall come out with great substance now I know I know it may be very elementary but we can see it from the scripture that Moses has not mentioned by name at all and this promise when God spoke this to Abraham God had Moses in mind I mean God you know that knew that Moses would be the deliverer God knew that Moses would be raised up in Pharaoh's house Amen God it ordained it thus but when God gave the promise when God gave the promise to Abraham to Abraham I mean Moses has not mentioned but Moses was part of the fulfillment of their promise yes Amen now God and then it's the same thing as we keep reading down when God would God would out lie the Western and the eastern borders of the promised land he says that thy seed will will possess from the UM from the River Nile he says the great river of Egypt under the great river Euphrates he was he was outlining the borders and then he also said about and then he listed all of the nations that the children of Israel would drive out so he said in that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the land of Egypt and to the great river of the the river Euphrates the Kenites and the kids and nights and the Cadman nights and the hittites and the perizzites and the rhythm ins and the Emirates and the Canaanites and the gershonites and the jebusites amens he says this land that these people are in that is that is thy seeds land but he never mentioned anything about Caleb or Joshua I mean because remember Joshua took the people into the land so so when when when God was giving this promise to Abraham a meant God and his mind you who will fulfill the promise right predestined there's a lot those that would fulfill that promise Amen so so Caleb and Joshua they were not mentioned but they will power the fulfillment of that scripture hallelujah now you know it's the same thing when you take you know I'm just gonna take a few through the scripture just take another one that's very obvious just to highlight this highlight this truth you know when Isaiah would speak and he would say in in Isaiah 40 and 3 the voice of one that Christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God now John was never mentioned by name in that scripture John didn't say a man called John the Baptist will fulfill the scripture he just had a voice of one crying in the wilderness and John and the fulfillment of that scripture amen but when God said to you know when god inspired isaiah to speak that word john i god saw john fulfilling that scripture cuz he was the manifestation of that scripture Allu you easily know there's a principle through the scripture that i've just gone through that when when god gives a prophecy he knows who's gonna fulfill it right he's know he knows who's going to be the manifestation of that prophecy remember God's Word cannot fail right so remember he says behold a virgin shall conceive behold a virgin shall conceive and it happened right Israel was in slavery in Egypt they came out and dwelt in the promised land it happened I mean a voice of one crying in the wilderness it happened hallelujah all these things remember God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass amen now let's just jump to the promise of Albay and I'll say this God knows exactly who's going to fulfill this let's go to revelations 19 and 6 I mean I love the scripture don't you let's just look at the promise of our day this because this is what the message is seem to produce and I heard as it were the voice of great of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God so know when when when John when John saw this when John was inspired to write he saw this in symbol form God knew exactly who would make up this number that would be called to the marriage supper of the Lamb God knew the ones would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white that would be the Lambs wife I mean even even in the scripture win when it says later in the Book of Revelations I'll show you the Lambs wife hallelujah now that was just in simple form and we know that the the book of Revelation is in simple form but yes I mean it has to become a reality it goes from simple form to reality form I mean we can even see this you know well it's it's very evident when when you look through the seals and you see the you know the horse riders the right of the Antichrist spirit down through the ages we can see it went from a symbol form to a reality form now that is the case on the on the negative side then how much more the case on the positive side I mean so that so so that it's just a simple form of the marriage supper of the Lamb but now it's become a reality form I mean we're a people would be would be prepared to meet the Lord a minute where our people would be united with him in this life hallelujah because that's what the true baptism of the Holy Ghost does it unites you and Christ together as one unit I mean it unites us together and we know that we're living in a uniting time and in the world is uniting I'm in darkness is uniting Amen but so is Christ and the bride United leader and it's and it's happening I mean we are living in the fulfillment of that scripture so so these are people upon the earth now I just want to I know this may be very obvious but I want to show I just want to bring this out because remember we should appreciate what we have I know we should appreciate what God has done for us and the cleansing of the blood and your everything he's done for us Ilia so so there's a people that would be made ready she would make herself ready no but but we read here in the scripture this is how she makes herself ready is it it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints I mean so the Lord already has the wedding garment prepared I mean the Holy Ghost the Word made flesh in you I mean that's the that's the wedding garment remember it's not our righteousness it's his righteousness I just say this you already you know you're already wearing the garment and if you become on with em you're dressed holy in his righteousness I'm in yours your to go thank you I mean so now this is not a assemble no more this is reality form this is a manifestation upon the earth I'm actually looking at people over over zoom here that are arrayed in fine linen clean and white the races of saying thank you I mean because remember this message brother ham says the bridegroom call will come right through this right man that there are people's hearts we turn back to the original faith of the fathers amen they'll become one with the word today I mean so so the scripture is fulfilled today now the Word of God we know is a seed and just like a natural seed it has to be planted in the right soil watered and then and the time and then and then in time the life that's in that seed will produce itself and it's only when it does that then you can see really what it is a menaces you know you just take in the natural you know a lot of seeds they do look the same and I used to work for a company that it wasn't in my my my part of the lab but there was a lab in Palmerston North and they were the seed lab and they had the study seeds to make sure that the seeds that were given to farmers to plant they were the seed that they were buying and they spent I don't know how long studying seeds before they actually were put into you know you're put into the workforce to test the seats that were given so but you know the people had to examine them now at that stage you could say well it would be easy just to plant the seed and you'll see what it is but they had to send them out and seed form first and then the manifestation was later when it was planted so you know it's only when the life of that seed comes forth you can really see what's in that seed oh we read in Luke 21 because it's now in the fig tree and all the trees put forth their buds you know summer is nice and now life life has come to its full manifestation and now we can finally see what's in the what what is in people yeah but there's only true powers in the world mmm is God and Satan those are the two powers and those two powers are being manifested in the earth yeah amen whether we like it or not those two those two powers of manifest so now Jesus would speak and he say that the Word of God is a seed and he also spoke of the parable of the sower the four types of ground now those four types of ground are still in the earth remember these four types of ground they are people right they are the hearts of people now he says here in investments he says and father I spread forth the seed I know when it falls into that predestinated ground it'll light up and shine blowing for the glory of God is his help us father we commit this to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus now he does say that preaching the word is like scattering seed but God knows that the ground that it will fall on and produce the crop that he's intending it to do hallelujah so he also says and works as faith expresses is now here producer planners in Plainview just like in it just as other seed the Word of God is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sowed seed just thrown it out there on the ground that would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among thistles and thorns it'll choke out pretty soon Jesus parable said so so the ground had to be made ready first so God and sovereign grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive it in the stage was he for me who you by his foreknowledge and ordained into eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you I mean so he will be upon the earth member like he said to Jeremiah remember he said to Jeremiah before you're in your mother's womb I ordained you I think the prophet to the nation's and it's exactly the same thing with us before we were in our mother's womb I mean he sanctified us he ordained us amen to be his bride I mean to be the Bride of Christ I mean so we were I mean those who truly received a word in this day they are the prepared ground hallelujah God before the foundation of the world prepared our heart receivers word in this day hallelujah Amen so remember it's not just the fig tree that puts forth its buds but it's all the trees brother Brown speaks of another tree called the bride tree and he would say in in Psalms one and one he says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I mean so he speaks of the bright tree and and you know he he says that it was planted on the day of Pentecost but then the Antichrist spirit came until finally in the Dark Ages it was just chewed down to a stump and he goes into the book of Joel and he speaks of the cankerworm farm worm caterpillar and locusts he speaks about the four stages the Antichrist spirit chewing the bride tree away til it's just a stump in the dark ages then the heart says I shall restore that saith the law now there has to come a time that what was growing in the day of Pentecost would be what would come forth again hallelujah and now remember we're living in the day of full manifestation yeah I mean it's not just Israel coming to their position it's not just the tears coming to their maturity but the week is going to her maturity as well he's coming to her benefit full manifestation manifestation under weasely or Luther I mean or even under Pentecost but a full manifestation of all the Word of God is manifested in a people hallelujah Amos day friends we're living in this day what is the full manifestation where God becomes fully tabernacle and a man I mean and a woman and a son or daughter of god alloh yeah we're the Bible as made flesh in you I mean when the Bible's made flesh in you holy and that is that is the full manifestation when you see Christ's character and its fullness in a people amen so now he would be planted by the rivers of living water hallelujah no other BAM season wisdom versus faith speaking of the of the parable of the sower says now some fell down in the belly deer where these rivers are did you notice I want to get something else what what was done it fell down in the river it wasn't sit out he that is like a tree that set out transpose from list of that no he that's planted what predestinated that thought of that thought of God before the foundation world placed him there see not stuck out not by chance but was planted see we're not on this by chance we were planted hallelujah amen I mean we were planted we are predestinated what to the rivers of Oh his route his route shall not wither Oh hallelujah though he died I'll raise him up again at the last day that's right he has predestinated to be there not just by chance it was pre decided to catch that word that when it was sowed she'll be right there when it sticks she is there he's planted not just stuck down he's actually planted that's right a lot different sticking a stick in the ground in planting something that's different the seed was planted it found its own root hold when the water begins to come in and break forth its life the spirit it begins to say you say there are nine spiritual gifts he says amen Jimmy Christ the same yesterday today and forever hey he still heals like you wasted a hallelujah he's planted by the rivers rivers coming from every side rivers of water no wonder he can't with her no wonder he's planted sowing seed fell over there he can't die it's right in the stream of life it keeps spreading now I'm reading this when I'm reading this you should be saying he's talking about me hallelujah that is a life pulsating forth amen is above the whole ego eimi nothing that's put on or patched on or covered up it's a life that's coming forth even if we shut it make God's living God's flowing as well as manifest [Applause] before I mean why because the rivers are flowing remember if I say that the word of God cannot fail that doesn't mean we're like sitting in the stands eating popcorn seeing seeing what will happen I mean but we're active in the word say Lord Here I am I mean Lord put on flesh and me like never before now not just spectators I mean we are not just spectators we are on the field hallelujah we're on the field of battle amen that's how we sure he's planted by the rivers rivers coming from every side rivers of water I wonder he can't whither I mean you can't where the children don't worry no I'm that some of them seed fell over there he can't die it's right in the stream of life it keeps producing that's right it's for life out of them rivers rivers the New Testament the Old Testament amen just being fed right there on through our brother entered and today this age that we're living now there is a bride tree coming forth see truly the tree has come up and they as soon as they organize they couldn't go any farther what happens they organize and go out on the slimmed in the Lumas pruned according to st. John 15 chapter he prunes them off they'll never use no more but the heart of that tree comes forth the fruit right on the top of it when the tree is fully matured it can't go no further right on the top the last church ages here she's a full mature it's a bride hello leo I happen to believe that look I believe we're not just a like an infant church or a newborn Church but now the Bride of Christ is a mature woman I mean she knows what the Lord was done with his word hallelujah amen now we know that the as as Jesus say by their fruits you shall know them they meant by so that's why you know as in the tree amen so now we know that that in this day that the capstone should come down upon a people divine love himself I mean should come down upon a people and join himself with the Church of the Living God that's the age we're living in right Amen that's right so when we go into first Corinthians 13 now we can see that this is more than just speaking about it now let's go to first Corinthians 13 hallelujah please go hello yeah so first Corinthians 13 and 1 this is the Apostle Paul speaking though he sees here though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I've become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal I mean so this charity we know is divine love it's God Himself God is love not a just a you know you know turn a blind eye and let you go on but it's a real love it's it's God's own love which not based on anything we do but it's God the election amen but now he's speaking about when charity is manifested member this is the age of charity this is the age of perfect love I mean member I mean we're living in a bride age right we're living in a bride age you know when you know you know the world has gone on until you know it continues on until ADOC a rich increased with goods have need of nothing they don't need nothing they don't need God they don't need anything but what they can do amen but but the but now the bride Amen is called out of Lady osya and up into a bride age I mean what God is manifesting his word and his bride amen I mean you could say an age within an age and you go see when brother baron speaks about a bride age he speaks about it all in the latter part of his ministry and the reason that is is because lady Arcia because of creeds and dogmas kicked Christ out of the church so so he's an outside of his church as was prophesied of this age he says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice I'll come unto come unto him and he will sup with me and and and in him with me so so Christ is on the outside of his church and this day trying to get back in right so so now God is no longer manifesting himself and his fullness and later seer so people are but he says if any man hear my voice and open the door and and and and I'm out basically then now there's a union of marriage going on so now it's a bride age and now we know him in a marriage is love I'm in a marriage I should be our marriages should be driven motivated by love by men know what you can get but what you can give hallelujah Amen and and that's how a family should be governed should be motivated by love era our actions how we treat our spouses how we treat our children how we treat each other should be motivated by divine love and nothing else that's how it should be because we're living in the age of divine love no remember it's a great contrast in this day gross darkness but this great light I'm in the you know that you know the love of many as wax cold unfortunately the Bible said it would but there's a people that are in love with the Lord Jesus Christ I mean that have returned to their first love in this hour now I'm looking at a people I believe that have returned to their first love amen amen no so he says that I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so it goes to show that we can know all the mysteries right he says though I know though I understand all mysteries so we can actually in the stay understand all the mysteries we can actually have an accurate complete timeline of what God will do in detail from now till the rapture but we can still miss it if you have not divine love God Himself manifesting through your life I mean you're not gonna be there amen so we can know all things see that's why it's such a trip people get caught up and do an increase of knowledge if I just understand what God is doing in this hour then I'll escape the wrath no if you know who will escape the rest you're the spirit of truth will lead you and guide you into all truth but my confidence isn't the fact that I know at the end therefore I'm going to take a rapture my confidence is I know him of the power Resurrection Rose I will raise I mean I have a body like his glorious body Holly I have eternal body waiting in the heavens for me already Rory thank you not as not that I may know all mysteries and I will put it out perfectly in front of you that you could see it it's not that that I know him I mean I see charity I see divine love manifesting through my being amen amen that's how we're gonna be lord help us make us more like you remember this the scripture we're reading has to put on flesh and this is the album and remember God's work cannot fail so if God says it's gonna happen it's gonna happen we'll help us Lord Jesus I know all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things in charity never faileth me but God cannot fail that's the one thing he cannot do but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part now this in part means in the Greek it means is a section or allotment it means a division or a shear so it's just a portion that what it means by in part right so though we prophesy though we know in part we prophesy in part but we net which is perfect has come now that word perfect means complete the fullness I mean we know in this day that the mystery of God should be finished right so we now have complete I mean when the complete has come in that which is in part shall be done away so that's not saying now many people many many message Baptist will take the scripture and say well we don't need the gifts of the Spirit we don't need prophecy we're and he's speaking tongues we need interpretation tanks we need discernment we don't need those things store more because that was the in part but actually no no no that's part of the fullness right but they had it in part but that means you don't take away that part you just get more right you know that's just part of the word but now we have the fullness of the word invocation never takes away he just adds right now the Lutheran's had the just shall live by faith remember they had a part the just shall live by faith yea the fullness of justification as you never did it in the first place sorry so they headed in part but now we have it in fullness Luther Luther had sanctification Luther had sanctification as you've got to live a holy life they had a method of being sanctified something that they humanly did for their sanctification or still a work of God in a way cuz God helped him but they only had sanctification and path but sanctification and its fullness as God comes unto you he changes your desires so the things you once did I mean you cannot do no more so you're sanctified from them he cleanses you from them right smoking drinking committing adultery wearing ungodly clothing watch young Galli movies music whatever it may be I mean that are on unholy things lying and stealing cheating backbiting whatever it may be I mean all those things he sanctifies from you so it's no longer man trying to live a holy life and having a method of sanctification but God comes in and he is the Sanctifier washed by the water of the word I mean I mean the power of sanctification but so now we have sanctification and its fullness Alleluia now the now the Pentecostals had the gifts of the Spirit a member and every age the Holy Ghost was in every age right the Holy Ghost was in Luther's day the Holy Ghost was through the dark ages even the Holy Ghost was in Wesley's day amen the Holy Ghost was in the Pentecostal day but they had it all in part but now after those three things have been restored now he would himself comes down and has fullness and in twelves and a people hallelujah so now we don't have these things in part but we have it in fullness we have all in fullness or everything we had everything Wesley had that was of God we but now in its fullness everything that I'm loose ahead and part that was of God we haven't in its fullness everything that the Pentecostals had and part we haven't its fullness remember God doesn't take away nothing he adds hallelujah so everything that they had we have I mean because it was now it was it was a partial manifestation a partial manifestation their day now it's a full manifestation in this day hallelujah to God amen because he says then that which is perfect complete has come the net witches and part shall be done away amen so when I was a child out now the Apostle Paul shows us when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things why because a child is growing to becoming a fully mature complete person right so they they can they can reason and part they can understand and part compared to what they'll be when they are mature adult I mean so sorry saying when I was a child I thought in part right but now I'm thinking in completion because when when I'm a child I'm growing to become a fully complete person right I mean that's that's even why you know teenagers you know the brain develop you know is still growing your brain is still growing there's there's two parts of your brain one the risk-taking part of the brain is fully mature but then the other part of the brain which says is a good idea are still growing hallelujah that's why we did crazy things that we're children but there comes a time it comes with time when both parts of the brain become fully mature and now the chick and the balancer there amen so you know sometimes we think my what man we did crazy stuff well the reason we did crazy stuff is our brains are growing we thought in part but now we think of scientifically true we all went through that stage and we got out the other side all right I mean see now we put away partial things right and now we have the fullness right hallelujah amen for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face we're living in that day we were seeing face to face I mean the veil of traditions gone I mean any any filter is gone hallelujah it's all gone now we see him face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am knowing hallelujah sorry saying that I know in part but I'll know as as I'm knowing this is a day when we are known knows we are knowing I mean will we really you know it's amazing what the Prophet would say about we are the scene g'd of God we have the seed gene of God producer before the foundation world when he says we came from God and we go back to God about the statement just think about the statement we win when he would say there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life and if you had eternal life I mean if you have eternal life now it's because you had eternal life in the beginning amen Cecily I remember it was maybe dormant in our souls but when the word in your way when the Spirit of God came you act quick in that scene and it brought you to a birth and then you begin to realize all my the grace of God that he would call me before the foundation of world and Here I am in this day to manifest his word in this day and the devil can't stop me amen stop gods weren't coming to pass hallelu nice words bristle or hallelujah mmm he sees an alibi tooth hope faith and charity now abideth Hope faith and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity the grace of these is divine love himself amen this is the our alive and Friends weird this is manifesting now I trust that you can see in your life when I read through that scripture I mean that you can get that life living through you sure we're still a nice you know we're still a nice you know falling bodies we need a body change I mean but when you're not can't you should see that life living amen hallelujah now he would say in second Corinthians four diabetes for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ for we have this treasure in earthen vessels this treasure eternal life right now Oh Lou yeah I trust you pick up that pearl of great price you begin to look at it say Lord how marvelous this is treasure that I'm carrying amen mber the the devil cannot stop you coming to your full manifestation amen this bride coming to her full manifestation it's impossible because of God said that I'm gonna have a bride without spot or wrinkle I'll make you I'll make her in my image that she will have my divine nature God doesn't worry isn't gonna happen is it not gonna happen he knows it's gonna happen oh yeah and we're already living in the final and the final part of that manifestation mmm-hmm we have this treasure in earthen vessels now I just want to leave you with this just before I turn the service over to brother and Paul for a couple of songs but you know we should look at things that are eternal anything else at this time things sure we should be aware of what's going on the world but don't get caught up in things don't worry don't stress about nothing remember of God before the foundation of the world he has ordained us to be his bride he ordained us to be his bride all right so if he is ordained as dust we are going to become it that's right we are gonna be that last generation I mean that that that defeats that last enemy which is death amen that last enemy will be put under our feet and the dead in Christ are gonna rise and we're gonna go and meet them go go with them to meet the Lord in the air hallelujah of us about day neva devil thinks there's no where people can go into a body change but God does not back up he does not worry how it's gonna happen he's ordained just to manifest it it's gonna be like remember nothing could stop David coming to the throne it doesn't matter how many glass came along how many Epsilon's came along didn't matter how many things were there I mean David set on the throne because God said I prepared a king in among Jesse's sons hallelujah mmm I'm thing with you and I raising pressing the battle base man spear we've been given a sure word of prophecy but now so we should look at things which are eternal the things that are not seen it's right No and in Hebrews chapter 11 when when the Apostle Paul woods would would write the divine commentary of Abraham's life it's safer they that say such declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is unheavenly therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city that they were so they said they're not we just pogroms and strangers on this earth we're just passing through destination this is not our final resting place faith we'd have the same revelation I'm just passing through came from God and I'm going back to God glory booyah we're just Pilgrims and strangers in this weary land oh and soon as very soon we're gonna see the king him as he is hallelujah we'll see them get in Christ rise there won't be any social distancing in that day where to God amen we should have that expectation yeah I mean I'm looking out yeah I know yeah you know I've said it before and sister Maggie knows who I'm talking about but I'm expecting brother blue Kennedy to walk through the door but not as an old man but as a young man with excuse me yeah parley and say the scriptures are rich and they know honey I know the raptures on this is the Blessed heart that we have we have this treasure remember the rapture as a people going to be where they came from that's right a mezra the rapture you know you know when when the Apostle Paul would say they which are alive and remain hellooo yeah I mean well not you know they which our life remain we'll go to meet the dead in Christ you know the Trussell race first and they which are alive and remain shall be caught up with him to meet the Lord in the air right it's from and that was prophesized through the Apostle Paul God saw exactly every single one that would go on that rapture so everyone he had already ordained already predestinated those that would fulfill that scripture just like Mary was predestined to become the mother of Jesus Christ that was the same thing with those ones who had a body change hallelujah so if God has ordained and I believe he's ordained us because this message has come to us this is a rapturing message right this message has come to change our bodies the spirit of John in this word has come in transform like to now think so so he seen this word to us we have received this word in the rainy days because there's a body to step into it's not by chance by chance I mean you're on this chunk oh I earned it oh it's good enough what no no that's irrelevant it's not those things God has predestinated us I mean to walk out of this world and see eternal that's right that's why this message has come to us and that's why it's a reality it's not head knowledge but God makes it live in our hearts manifestation and with that I'll close keep pressing the battleframes don't despair hmm don't worry about what you see around you about what maybe your family's doing or don't be caught up in the hysteria and the worry say Lord it's from watching and waiting for they're glad millennial day where Jesus says no catch is waiting right away this is the time to to let every promise be fulfilled like we never prayed before we've never been sincere before hmm listen don't worry about anything but with strong confidence say Lord it's mine even it was fearful about getting his mountain have you thought about it you know I like to think about Caleb do you think Caleb was afraid am I gonna get the mountain am I not gonna get the mountain he wasn't living there under this promise he wasn't living in fear under this promise as I know that mountains mine I'm gonna get the mountain Alleluia and he got the promise with us friends don't be fearful but our strong confidence Lord you're alive yeah you here to fulfill your word of my life and Here I am amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer shall we and then I'll turn the service to brother Paul let's pray
