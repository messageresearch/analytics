that you came down to die for us that we could have we could be back there so we just want to commit this nights you and just thank you for your grace and mercy towards us Lord in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord God bless you can take your seats and this evening my guitar string broke no no there was only one I was sort of in the middle of her I was in that awkward zone between a guitar and a ukulele kind of like being left handed you know who's left-handed here are you I gotta take that back hey I've got um haven't you my children left handed one to anyone else don't we have three maybe three me over fifty Percy pray for me no so I just ask you to sit down because the the reading I've got is actually three chapters long but I'm not going to read the whole three chapters so I'm just going to paraphrase these a story and you know I'll let you know what what it's about after that but I'm if you got that is they kind of work I haven't done it's from um we're on judges 19 but you I think this is a reasonably well known story so you will know the story as we go into it is this thing gonna cooperate or is it gonna be like a catastrophe you go well is that you brother out amount or does that mean okay can you do that and try and get this going well that's hitting now I've got to move quick into this because Wednesday nights are supposed to be assuming it you know not just sermon and hum Enya this became more like a sim and so I've got a rush through it to get through it because I have to get to the end of it because that's that's the I'm not going to tell you anything you don't know though you know what I'm like I'm not that smart I just sort of repeat stories in it and put them all together but I don't know you won't hear anything that I did before so the story is about there was a there was a man and the Bible says he was a Levite this is in the time of Judges and the Bible says that he sojourned sojourned on the hill country and Ephraim which is here and he had a concubine and his concubine weaned off and left him and did things and then she after that has which it was his wife went back to Bethlehem which is down here so he leaves this man but this man is a he's a nice person he's a forgiving man and one day he thinks I'll go back and I'm gonna go and see my wife and I want to bring her back to me so he would have been a nice man and so he walks from him and as his servant and as we went with and he walks from there all the way down to Bethlehem and the father-in-law and the wife very happy to see see him so they welcomed him in and his father puts on a feast that night and they have the feast and he's gonna he says well have the feast tonight and then he says I'll leave the next day and go back to be him the next day comes and they wake up and he wants to go and the father Norse is no stay another day stay heaven it will prepare another feast tonight you can stay so he says okay I'll stay another night so here's another feast that night and I think he had another feast the next day see I'll go today and he said as father nor sit no stay another day maybe because in those they when the maybe the daughter leaves yeah and you don't travel that far it's not gonna see them for a long time no Facebook no Instagram but I believe he actually enjoyed this men's company he was probably a nice man and so the third day he stayed another night and then the next day he said look I have to go today he sort of tarried along and you know maybe lunchtime one or two o'clock he said no look we've got to carry on I've got to get back so so he starts walking back now because he left in the evening from Bethlehem which is down here he lived from me to him four five six o'clock an hour or twos walk three three hours walk it's starting to get dark and they come to a place called gibbous which is modern-day Jerusalem but back then it was Jebus because the Jebusites were there and his servant says look here we're at the city why don't we go on and lodge here for the night and the Levite says no I don't want to go on lodging in a city of these heathens I want to go to our people to the children of Israel we'll go into one of these cities Sosa's we'll carry on and we'll go to Gibeah which is maybe another few hours up the road so they they travel on up to give you I just put this so you can see an idea of we these places are and they get here and they go way down on the street and then an old man comes along and he's coming from the fields maybe he worked an hour or so out and he's walked back and he sees this family and their servant and he says them come and come and lodge at my place so so for us working out for this man and they go into his house and lodge but then the Bible says there are these wicked men in the city back that actually come to the house and say similar to what happened in Lots time who are the men that came here they said who was in their sin demand out to us send them out and these were the Boyle calls him men of Belial is he's just wicked men but they were Israelites this was not the sort of thing this man was expecting to encounter and and there's been an and the City of Benjamin because that's where they were and and they're also got quite violent and I don't know how they worked in those days but in the end that the man says look I'll I've seen you out my concubine my wife what she just walk all the way to get the seat here up and the night happened and in the morning they so they're over there the pictures for the children that's the father-in-law and then in the morning they come outside and his concubine is laying on the steps of the house and he goes to wake her up and finds out that she's dead so these men had did what they did during the night and and killed his wife and I won't say it was a way that he made leave all those rail know what happened because he was understandably upset by the situation so he he he did an act and let all of the people of Israel know this is what the children of Benjamin have done to me in the city okay now we're in the whole country because they did find out about it because they all received a little piece of here when the hog and then they were disgusted by what happened they they said okay we're all going to gather together and deal with us they what they were horrified so they all they all meet the Bible says they all meet and Mizpah which you can see most powers up here so they all meet here the whole of us were all gather around and the Bible says that there are four hundred thousand footmen so 400,000 soldiers that come so every able man of Israel they said everyone come here we're going to deal with us this was turned this is turning out to be a very big deal and here's the man the man tells them this is what happened when I went to the city of Benjamin this is how it worked now the one will say so the Miniver swear I will get it together against the city knit together as one man and they went down to the city and they said bring out the men that did this thing and the people of the city said no we won't we won't let them out and then so the children they they they went back to Mizpah and then it says the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God and see which of us shall go first to the battle against the children of Benjamin and the Lord said Judas shall go first so see it's in Judah down first so Judah goes out to battle the Knicks there against the city of the Benjamin Heights and they were beaten that Judah was beaten then they lost 22,000 men that day and they retreat then the next day they gather themselves back to where they started the battle and they encourage themselves in the Lord the Bible says and they do a bit of a weep and a fast during that day and then they say to the Lord again Shelby you're going go up to battle against Benjamin and the Lord said go up so they went up the next day and then the next day they went again and they lost 18,000 men and they lost the battle again so the second battle they've lost then they come back to the Lord and they say Lord what should we do you know they inquire again at the Lord and the Bible says that the Ark of the Covenant was with him in those days and Aaron and this is shallow yet go to battle to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother or shall I cease and the Lord said go up for tomorrow I'll deliver them into your hand so the next day they go up to the city and what they do is they they they have this plan they think we'll all sort of wait like this we'll wait around they're hiding away some men can come up and then you can act like you're being beaten and run off and then the children of Benjamin will get confident think I will defeat them like we did on the first two battles and they'll run out after you and then we'll we'll do it at an ambush and we'll you know burn the city then we'll come and destroy them so there was their plan that third day and it worked they defeated the city the children of Benjamin fell for their trap and then after that they went through all the land of Benjamin to every city and they raised it to the ground they slew everyone in the city and burnt the cities they went from everywhere and they destroyed basically Benjamin and 600 men of Benjamin escaped and they ran up to the hills to the rock ramon which is here the rock ramon 600 men escaped but the rest of benjamin they wiped out City after City after city and then when all the slaughter had vanished I guess they were calmed down a bit and then they looked at the situation and they thought Lord houses come upon us that we've actually almost wiped out an entire tribe of one of one of a whole tribe they said Oh Lord God of Israel why is this come to pass Sinestro that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel because here only 600 men left so they knew that they were up there and then they thought well we've got to fix up the situation somehow so they they said well who didn't come with us to the battle who didn't come and they said well there was a tribe from Jobi Gilead the tribe but they were a group that said he didn't come down to us in the battle so this is what we're going to do we're going to go to that city and we're going to kill all of him and we're going to take anyone that's a this is nasty we're gonna take you to it they're virgins and we're gonna bring them take them we're going to give them to these children of Benjamin's so that Benjamin carry on I need to say here too when they went to Mizpah they made an oath they said none of us will give our daughters that the children of Benjamin ever so all the men made an oath we will not give them our children our daughters so they weren't going to get any but see because those men of that city weren't there they didn't make that oath so they slew them all and took those two orders and gave them possess they put all this is not breaking our oath they didn't they didn't come to the gathering right and it wasn't enough they brought 400 and they came to the children Benjamin which were in the rock Ramon you and they said here take these 400 but it wasn't enough they needed another 200 because there were 600 men so then they said okay they said every year there's a feast and Shiloh here we gather together for a feast then and then the young maidens now they go to the vineyards and dance and things they said what you mean or if Benjamin can do is you can come down and hide in the vineyards and when you see a woman in the vineyard you can go on kidnap here and grab here and take her away back up to where you are this is crazy it's crazy you can take them and they said when the father or the Brethren come to us to say this is what the children have Benjamin did you can say we'll tell them look it's for a good cause and and even though you gave one of your daughters to the children of Benjamin and you've meant oh that you wouldn't you did not give the your daughter your daughter was stolen from you so you'll be free from the oath that you made that be okay and so the first year they went and kidnapped 200 woman and went up and then the tribe of Benjamin carried on I finished reading this story and I thought man what a what a what a very interesting story and it didn't make any sense to me that the whole situation I had another sermon what I thought was a bigger one that I was going to do and it was actually it was about um you know in the olden days of the mean would sail around the world they would leave animals like pigs on certain islands and then carry on because they would say if another boat comes in and they get shipwrecked Lee or anything they can Headly a fine wildlife on this island these islands so some of these some of these strands of animals like pigs and things they were from the early english days and they will get released on an island and then they would stay there for sometimes 100-200 years yeah and as time progressed people found these pigs in them they realized well these are gonna be good for modern medical use because here were these pigs on the soil net but untainted they had no no disease and they could they actually started using these pigs for medical research and for making a lot of things so they were because all the pigs on the mainland were all tainted and I was going to type that with the Word of God being kidding the way and coming back but but this came up now I'm not going to say this is what the story's about but the what I want to speak about today as a as the pit tonight is the perfect will and the promise of will of God but I'm going to go through a few other stories any more cut back to that one at the end and you'll know these stories but your interest thing to just think about think about they're interesting do you think about because it's it's it's been very interesting for me I'm gonna start with one you know but I've had a great time looking into this and understanding the dynamics of a especially since I know more South Africans in but more about the country this is um Florence Nightingale the lead Florence Nightingale and her story is that she was a it wasn't really a nurse because they didn't hypnosis when she was nursing but she went to the war and Crimea like 1850 I think it was around that period and she took some other people with her and the way that the hospitals would operate in those days was you know the doctor min would come out and look after the guys at night and then five o'clock sign out you know see you guys will be back in the morning and go home and do what they're doing come back in the morning and see who's still alive basically you know but this this lady here thought well that's not really working we've got to stay with these guys and look after them and in you know at night they need people as well so she would she would go around with your lamp all night and have heavy who the lady she brought with him just looking after these men all through the night and she got the nickname or the church she got named the lady with the lamp I think they were one of the London newspapers called you the lady with the lamp and there was a poem written about here from no brother branham was one of his favorite problems was the lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime so there was Henry longfellow so he also wrote a poem about about Florence Nightingale now he was in America she was in Grand Europe so her fame must have spread abroad you know over to even and this was only a few years afterwards he wrote this poem so she was quite well known he says lo in that house of misery a lady with the lamp I see passed through the glimmering gloom and flipped from room to room I'm talking about what she would do to help the soldiers now there was another Florence Nightingale brother Brown sees here that she's the great-granddaughter of Florence Nightingale when it comes to these sort of things he's not - doesn't he doesn't really bore himself with the meticulous details of situations I've learnt in my research of it he when it comes to the Word of God he does but when it comes to just you know he might say it was a week ago and it was two years ago he's like that's beside the point that was and the time period before bus you know so so he says here that you know this was florence Nightingale's great-granddaughter well she didn't have any children she was single of your whole life so but Florence Nightingale was a distant was a relative of Florence Nightingale but not it not of the direct lineage of not a great grandchild but it's it is what it is so I'll just read you this here so brother Bosworth one day brother Bosworth came showed me ask Ellen's picture see brother branham Florence Nightingale is calling from Durban South Africa come pray for her said she's great-great granddaughter or something whoever you know to Lake Florence Nightingale laughter over there and he said all these noble and those renounce and he said but you see brother bras worth with all these things going on I can't you know brother Bosworth I can't go the way things are now I can't do it let's just pray so they all kneel down and they they pray for this lady Florence I've just left a few things out there and and then he prays he says Lord I've always wanted to go to Africa so I'm gonna pray for Florence tonight we're gonna kneel down and pray and if she gets healed I'll take that as a sign that I go to Africa to South Africa and now notice she was from Durban so then and he lifted at that didn't hear anything of it I don't know how long this was maybe a year or two later whatever was King George of England had written letters to brother Branham and to his campaign and they'd heard about him and they requested that he come over to England and pray for him for King George and most of us when we get us from a king to come and pray we will probably jump on the next flight and go over there but he said look I'm over busy at the moment I'll just pray for you here and you'll be okay scintillator back and um and they seemed to lead it back saying no we would really like you to come over here and pray there to kind of persuade him to come he didn't care too much he wasn't he wasn't gonna doesn't didn't matter what social standing ahead and in his eyes it didn't matter what social standing you were it was about the state of your soul maybe they were people too as ministering to that hey this is my job here in that he wasn't a sellout so but eventually he said look we're going to we want to go to Europe anyway and do it do a trip around there so what we'll do then is we'll fly into England and then I'll go and pray for you and then we'll carry on around Europe so they fly to England and somehow Florence Nightingale from Durban South Africa finds out now she's English she's a missionary in Durban she finds out that brother Brennan was going to England and they don't know how it was but I I I'm guessing it was because of her family that she was an Ender you know she was a Christian family and I think also of a certain circles maybe the word got around in those circles that our brother Brown was going to come and pray for the king it was probably was nun with an circle so she may be hood it and maybe got hold of his itinerary when's he gonna come can you find it a science so that no stance there's no sign so to find out when he's going to apply and cuz she timed here sort of fly in to be everyone when he arrived so he's going to pray for the King of England and this lady Florence Nightingale turns up and and gets a message to them and they say look that lady Florence is here in England and they weren't you go and pray for her so they they go to her where she's staying somebody's house and and they pray and and then she gets with us saith the Lord or to their to pick that she's going to be okay so that was here before they prayed essentially of what she looked like she I forget the disease and then that's here it's before and after it's like our BC life in Christ you know we're skeleton of what we should be in afterwards we're full of life so that that's so that's what happened to hear so now he finds out that she's been healed because after a while she seen some this next picture this is me brother branham I'm completely healed so now he's made a promise to God if not a promise but he said if you here if you'll hear me I'll go to South Africa namely Dubin go fast so now he plans a trip to Durban not to do my sorry to South Africa and they they lined the strip out for him I think this is the first trip I think that's a quick photo now they fly into Johannesburg so and brother Branham says he's flew him for a few days and he was tired but he turns up and they have a meeting like the first day he's here they have a meeting and and the meeting is a as a success they're just people are healed souls are coming in things are happening here's one story if he just as soon as I got on this is to the service and Johannesburg I saw a vision just break before me and he came boy with one leg about six inches shorter than the other I've seen his lemon come down normally looked throughout to see where the boy was I've seen him sitting we hadn't had time to give out no prayer cards we couldn't call up Krillin why no not that kind of crowd and I see a young man Jesus has healed you you've come here from Durban and he has made you well stand up on your feet beers leave was perfectly well the headlines in the paper the boy the reporters Windham editors needs to see testified his father and mother there it was so saying this boy got healed and then the headlines were in the paper and this is the newspaper article here up this boy his name was um Ernest blue him this is an interesting read if you haven't read this if you read this last Sunday evening Ernest maybe I'll put on what's it so they took he gives a testimony says we heard about this man and this pastor in South Africa and America and we heard he was coming here so we drove up to Durban our to jet from Durban to Johannesburg that's what his parents are saying he says we were in the meeting and then Ernest says that the the pastor Brandon told us to lay hands on each other and pray so I did and someone laid hands on me and then he said I felt this weird sensation coming through me and then I thought I think I'm healed but he didn't know that and then he got asked to come on the platform and he said he walked around and he was healed and brother Adam arm will love this he said you know what I'm healed so well I'm even playing cricket now that was down the bottom here now I play cricket and other games say so now he's only been here a day and already he's done newspapers and they're testifying of what the Lord's done the next morning the Medical Association called up and said they wanted to have breakfast and wanted me to have breakfast with him and they gave me the right hand of fellowship I said that's true divine healing and we rappin their hospitals to anything that you want well you're here so the hospitals are saying the Medical Association says you can look we believe this comin do whatever you want it's yours that the city is yours and then and then the day after that a few days after that they're having meeting after meeting for a three or four days a couple of Afrikaans men ministers are at a house with brother Branham and one is disagreeing to find healing and the other one is agreeing with it and and the one that was agreeing with it and and was for brother branham he was getting so I'm not angry but he got to the point where he said to this other man here is out there visitation this is our day of visitation and your you're missing it you're just you're walking away from it he said I'm gonna go outside now and pray for your lost soul that's what he did and so he walked out of the house and walked out to the yard and started praying and this is his testimony he said when I was out here an angel came to me and laid his hand upon me to go back inside and tell him so he comes running back and he says look I was out there praying for you and an Angels need to come in and tell you you know that the name's will came and they said he the angel put his hand on my back it felt like it burnt my back and they looked on his back he was a bit handprint on his back okay the man couldn't how do you believe it and now they and and then that went into there I think the Johannesburg front page of the local of the city paper there that and they took a photo of this nation he got brother branham's hand in his hand foot perfectly on the print so now and this is now this is he's only been here a few days and he's in the newspapers the Medical Association are opening up the doors for them to come in and the Lord tells him the Lord says now this is what I want you to do brother Brennan I want you to stay in Johannesburg he says here and then they wanted me to leave this is very good story gets interesting he says so that night I remember when I went to pray the angels and all came down and he said to me don't go down there he said you stay right here in Johannesburg for two weeks and then you go over to brother Sydney Jackson's place which in mid-city Jackson before he didn't know the guy he said you go to his house go hunting after that go to Durban and wait there till I tell you what to do and you'll be in Durban you'll be here for about a month so the Lord said this is what I want you to do stay here for two weeks go hunting then go to Durban the the Afrikaans brothers that are organizing the trip had other plans they had planned a big long series of trips all essentially this direction like like because brother a dimensions clogs drop through room Fontaine Kimberley cake town and these here I just made up so this is just but it was a big circuit they planned on doing and they said no no sir brother MCS look brothers God told me this is what this is our itinerary and they said no no no no no that's not our itinerary this is our itinerary and that's where all the trouble began to start now the next day they were going from Johannesburg to Pretoria which I guess is two hours drive or one hour yeah sounds like they were doing a day trip up there and back you know so and he said look when we go up to Pretoria on this trip the Lord gave me a version to show you that what I'm telling you was the truth he said we're gonna see a man in purple was gonna be in purple which was probably a unique color beer we're gonna this is gonna be a robe where there's usually lots of sellers this time there's only gonna be one and you're gonna be quite surprised as just one seller of beads and things on this road and he said we're going to visit somebody that some that's almost sick but this person's not going to get here they're going to die but we're gonna go and pray for them and then brother Bosworth you said you're going to point out to me a peculiar bird so you're saying as we go to Pretoria we're going to see all these things happen so that you'll know what I told you that we shouldn't go down on this other route is the truth and so they went down they saw all these things and he pointed them out hard is the seller the is the man in purple is the bird but they insisted no no we've made plans and we've got to stick with the plans maybe you didn't hear from God brother branham would he flatly refused after all I said I'm not going God told me don't go no no no and he would say pull the car over I'm not going any further so they started going down to quick stroke yeah and it was on the way down if you understand the situation what was happening was brother bear him didn't have any money - he had no money these brothers are flying them here and they they were taking him around on the trip and he had no money and they had as a cherry and everything and annual of people so but he was telling brother Bosworth we've got to stay so you can understand the pressure so he really sought God one not and then God said look you know you're trapped in this now you've kind of got to go with them now it's just the way it's all worked out and everything he said but but you'll pay for it and he said to them look God told me last night that we can carry on on the circuit but it's going to be in this permissive whirling we're going to pay for this for doing this owners permissive will we're going to pay for it and he told them that you know it's going to be a fine day today he said we're going to pick up a boy in a car in a suit and boy where you get you'll see him in the car we're gonna see a native with a stick suit about to strike another man in his certain place and they saw all these things and he said see I told you now we're gonna be in this permissive world and he said and brother Bosworth as a witness of God the very next meeting all hell broke loose is that right trouble sittin and it was that way till we got plum to Durban so God still moves but the first meeting they're heading clerks throught the first night hurricane blew through and they then it just carried on and carried on through they had to cancel the meeting the second nighter was bitterly cold I couldn't it was just so cold and brother Brown said look third night there be an earthquake this is we're outside the will of God so they carried on they went to another just to give you examples of what was happening they went to Kimberley there was a church there that held four hundred people and the Africa and some of it you can understand he's stubborn Afrikaans people unconverted this man this old man seated brother in his seat he was a nice man but he said no we're having the meeting in my church and that's it and Mike judge let's church but four hundred people and there were twelve thousand wanting to go to the meeting he said we're having it here that's a and brother Graham said look we're doing all this we could have been in Johannesburg there were beds there were rooms everyone could have come from the whole country and just we could have had meetings here for two weeks the word will get out they could come they could stay we could have big auditoriums but they did this instead and then they all got suck all of brother programs did all of his people got sick and the effort Afrikaans men got sick as well and so they carried on these meetings the Lord moves the Lord healed people the Lord did things and I venture to say there are still there would be people in South Africa today that were it came in through this you know there would be and things happen because this God still moved yeah and he says they were got sick on this journey around here then they got to do and then brother Graham didn't know this but he found out later that Durban was the only place that they didn't have segregation that all the different races could come to the meetings and so that's when they had the meeting in Durban when they finally got the other held it held a big meeting at the racecourse and that was the time when 30,000 people came to the Lord on one night and and there were truckloads of stretchers and everything like that and I believe that's what the Lord had planned for every meeting for a month but I think they only really had one there like this now this was a painful experience for brother Brennan because it just went from bad to worse all the way around and even though God still moved miracles still happened I think he thought it's probably not over for me yet and he'd caught he will go here so here's just some of the pictures from that meeting massive meeting the head and Durban from Durban at you are you guys from Durban yeah cool place now brother branham caught african amoeba or something he was sick for about six months sick when he got back to America he the doctors his friend doctor that came to visit him sort of gave up what I'm saying look it's just it's just got to do its thing you may love you made don't like it into your brain and you might die that's just we can't do anything about this particular disease and he was sick he couldn't hardly walk he he just would stumble around the house and I don't think he was a happy man for that time you know being really sick day after day there's only so much the human mind can enjoy till you get frail and you just get down I mean I don't think he was down spiritually but he would have just been down day after day after day and any city would go and try and seek God and God it's like God wouldn't just wouldn't answer I see a girl's brother Bosworth and pray and then it's like God just turned his back no he didn't hear from God about it nothing and and to be who he was it would have been quite a hard thing he said Lord I want to read this here I said lord I appreciate the stripes and the whooping that you gave me for disobeying you but from this time on Lord knowingly ever again I'll never tie myself up with a bunch of nobody else preachers managers or no one else but I'll be free to do what you say do I'll just go where you say go and do just what you say do the rest of my life and I'll always try to do just as you say do and about that time here he come so this is after the Lord has said to him I'm sort of drummed through the story about the Lord had said look I'm gonna forgive you it's all over now and he said about that time here his Bible came again he saw in a version that race off the table and it was turned over to the place where Paul in the storm said to the men you should have listened to me and should not have loosed from Crete and none of this would have happened so the angel of God pointed this out to them so now brother Branham this whole scenario is finished and he's forgiven and he gets healed overcomes his sickness but I was interested in that that's just the way that I work now we're going to go and touch on Paul and Crete just because they've anyone looked into this but it's quite interesting I thought of you brother George this is around your area and when it was determined that we should sail to Italy a deliverer Paul and certain others prisoners until one named Julius a century novel Gustus banned and Entering up the ship after such and such a place we launched many to sell by the coast of Asia so this is the journey we were going to take this Eddy okay and the next day they touched down their leaf from down the bottom star they touch down and sidon and they said and Julius beautifully entry to Paul and gave him Liberty to go on and to his friends to refresh himself and from and when we had launched from thence we sailed under Cyprus which is around this way because the winds were contrary so this must have been the only journey they could take and when we have soured over the sea of Cecilia and pent philia we came to Myra which is here and then they were because they were sailing all the way to Rome and they tried to sail from here across the creek but the ones weren't doing much and they ended up around over here and then finally the ones picked up and they came this side and then they say they sailed around here and they ended up in here around pass the fie havens they ended up in here and this is Crete and the season was coming on there is a certain time that you that the ship stopped sailing this area here because it gets too rough and I think even today even the cruise ships there's a certain time they stop they don't sail and these open waters that must get really rough and here is where brother George is from have you been to Crete so now now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now really passed which is a certain time of the year and they don't sail after that Paul am honestly Messina them serious I perceived that this words will be without hurt and with much damage not only of the land lading of the ship but also of our lives nevertheless the Centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul so Paul saying we shouldn't go and these guys say we're going to go and so they set sail and I believe Paul saw a vision and and it doesn't say that here but the Bible opened up to brother Bremer said this we're having de Paul I don't think Paul just mentioned it to him once I think he said brothers and mean this is I've seen you've seen what the laws done for me we shouldn't be going on this journey it's not going to go well for us I think it would have said day after day after day that we shouldn't be doing this even when they launched we should turn around because he knew they were going in the wrong direction and we know what happened they had a big storm came up and they were almost a month out there until they finally washed up on the island of Malta have you been to Malta no it's quite a I know I'm n from there and that's where that when they were there that pulls through the snake bit him he threw it in so that was that was part of this journey outside the perfect will of God essentially but that's what happened there and they carried on so that's the story that the Lord showed to brother Brenham the interesting thing about these is God had a world and has a regular quote from brother Brennan but here's a permissive world now that's where the trouble lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take us for muscle world though it's not right he will make us permissible to work out together to glorify His perfect will there's nothing will go wrong with God he knows just we the clock's ticking it tonight but there's nothing wrong every liquors hitting just exactly where it should be everything we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this it's a little bit miss understandable for me that concept but God is far greater than my mind that Paul was always going to go to that Island and get bit by the snake and flick it off the net those men were going to come in from Malta but yet he wasn't supposed to be there but you know work that way this and but God but brother Graham says God's got a way of making everything work to his perfect will even when man goes a different direction he can still turn it all to make it work for his perfect world even though man's world goes a certain way okay I'm gonna make this now I want to go back to the story with that information in mind I'm not going to say this is the interpretation of the story but it's the only way I can understand it and when you think about what happened in Africa how these men had this world and they wouldn't Bend on their will and they and brother Brown as much as much as he tried to tell them the will of God the human will wouldn't Bend they said no so God being PEZ well to the will because he still want a brother round to go around amazing God changed his will to say okay we'll do what you want to do then that's fine that's what he did and you deceive it so we can't actually have our will so strong that we can actually go a certain way and Bend God's will to go our way and God will still be with us but he's not really with us but he's with us you know what I mean we can bend his will and we've got a interesting to see how we lead our life so so this thing it happened and all the children of Israel gathered together in Mizpah and when they were in misfire they all had the same wealth because the next one here says so all the men of Israel will get it together against the city knit together as one man they all had one world we're going to go down and wipe out those people that's it that was their will four hundred thousand men had we're not to get it as one man so now what they now do is they go and ask counsel of God they say God we want to ask you some counsel you know what they asked them they said we're going to give you twelve options you pick which one you want to take that's what they said because there were twelve tribes they say which one of us do you want to go up first not Joey go up not Lord God this is great son yeah God we're gathered to give it to you because this has happen houses happen in our country you Lord we we don't have any preconceived force what we're going to do we just come before you and we just want to lay the situation before you they simply give you twelve options eleven options which one he's going to take he said I'll take option one thanks Judah that's what he said Lord who shall we seen that first seen Judah so Judah goes up what happens to Judah gone God didn't say he just answered their question I believe that was a now when you start thinking permissive well here so they so they after this they encourage themselves in the Lord and they get back says they the people the men of Israel encourage themselves in their battle again an array in the places where they put themselves and array the first day so they sit that's right - sit back let's gather together and do this again they encourage themselves we're going to do this don't falter brethren keep our minds strong and this purpose that's what they did and then they went back to God and they said shall we go again to battle so there stands to get a wee bit more humble but they said sure we go again God says yeah go again they wanted to go again anyway because they were all encouraged in the Lord and we're going to go back again and what these what that Benjamin writes out so they went again and they were beaten again now the third time they were a bit more humble but I think their will was still beating a certain way so God Gordon essentially bins as well to their will and says ok go up tomorrow again this time you'll beat him ok they go up and they kill these people their City and then they go on this rampage throughout all of the tribe of Benjamin and kill everyone there I don't believe it was God's perfect will to wipe out the tribe of Benjamin there see that wasn't God's perfect will if he hadn't have intervened in the situation these these means intention was to just wipe out the whole tribe so we talked you know we need to focus about God's permit his perfect well still working in situations I believe that it was of God that these 600 men escaped up to the hill somehow during the battle things would have happened in it just the children of Benjamin just couldn't get these men and they they just didn't work and they went away and they had to chase on these other men and these men escaped because otherwise the whole tribe would have been wiped out and yet God had said you will win that day and I'll be with you and you're one essentially now when this rampage had finished and there they will have started to they started to come to themselves a bit more I guess you'd say they were so worked up and they could actually be a bit more what's the word receptive to - they started to feel bad oh god how could it be that was their question Oh Lord God of Israel why is this come to pass this day there shall be today one tribe lacking in Israel why is this come to pass they start to I think the the will of God as they start to relax a bit more and their own because they've done their well now okay we've done that now once you've done something your will to do it goes away so this now that now the will of God can start to see dallona but they thinking why have we done this but they had already done it they'd already walked in his permissive will and the thing about going in his permissive will it's just me see it's me see we miss things up and we we make a big mess and then that miss has got to get cleaned up some here yeah gotta get so what they had here now was a miss Wow here now we've almost wiped the whole tribe that is only 600 min left what are we gonna do and we've all given an oath we're not going to give you any of our daughters so these this tribe is going to die it's a mess they've created this big mess from the own will and then they have to try and clean this mess up so they're going to make more miss well does what we do we'll go and kill this whole other city and get those woman and give them to them make more trouble just to clean up a mess that they made through their own will and when that didn't work it wasn't enough they said ok we'll we'll just work it ass out this little way that ok kidnap all these girls from here and take them up when you get to the end of the story you think man what an absolute mess these men made you think if they had have gone there and most parents said oh god what do we not what do we do God we bring the situation to you how do you want to deal with this but not no no I had even one deal with that Lord it's just we just give it to you this is horrible this is it would mean that we're trying to go after other meaning when they couldn't give it they killed this other woman this is we just we don't want this Lord guy we bring it to you God could have he could have he could have actually made doesn't mean died right there or he could have said go down to the city and even if the men of the city said no we're not gonna send them out maybe there could have been an old man in there you know the Bible talks about this no let's not all die for the sake of these men let's cast them out you know and take them in and slave him something you know I'm saying like he could have been a simple solution if the head have just sought God I said God what do you want us to do I don't believe God would have done this this way I don't believe this was his perfect will to go and cause so much miss that he did God's Way would have been he God wanted to execute judgment upon these people and he one of the tribe to carry on that was his perfect world but these mean went out to try and do it they forgot about the second when they tried to do the first one execute judgment their way and then whoops would be to try and carry this trial and so would do this to carry that on they made an absolute mess of the situation destroyed lives and caused you think of the car the hurt and that area for generations to come about what happened not just them but like these the woman that were taken away kidnapped and their families broken up and everything and all us that would have been dramatic for that whole area yeah for a hundred years where God could have dealt with that and an incident clean it's just done people were rejoicing God's put away the wickedness from amongst us all however and yet man's the will was so strong that they that God let them go their way and just make this big mess and I guess when we it was an interesting story for me because I when you look into this you think God I want to keep not my will but thine be done i I don't ever want to get into this predicament where where I've got where I'm sitting on doing something and then you come and join me in that just because I want to and I and because it's going to end anytime the man did that it ended in a disaster and and Lord I pray Lord may may I always be humble and lay aside my will and say Lord I'm not going to try solve problems and I'm going to bring them to you I'm not going to try to figure out my own direction in life I'm gonna give it to you do what you want to do I want your perfect will and I don't want to forge on with my idea because it by my research it doesn't work and and I believe that a sincere the beautiful thing is with God is that as brother Branham said he actually makes it all work out anyway and you good even though you do that I'll choose a rather choose this path even though you'll be faithful to me you'll make it all work some way because we we don't get too discouraged by it because we make mistakes God makes it all work out perfect in the end and all those situations it all worked out it just wasn't quite as good as what he could have made it yeah and that's that's I believe as Christians that's what we want and as we go on more in our walk we we make mistakes here and there and we just slowly learned his voice we learn when we do wrong when we do right and we we slowly know what direction we should go and we and I believe those of us you know we're all sincere and we we really desire the will of God for the perfect will of God for a lie I really believe that I mean that some let's just stand tonight we're just um pray and then sing a song heavenly father we're so grateful Lord that you are the great Shepherd as David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth me beside the still waters Lord and through the green pastures Lord then he goes on to say yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Lord and it's nice to know that you are the great Shepherd Lord that if we just follow your leadership Lord that your leadership to us is always good it's always perfect your will for our life is always good Lord and may you give us ears to hear Lord in our mind to understand what your what your will is for us each day not only a big decisions a little bit in small decisions may we be conscious Lord that you have a will you have a a desire for us Lord and as brother Brennan would say Lord that that he would realize that life was far too complicated for him and there were far too many variables that he would he felt safer just waking up in the morning and asking you to lead him say Lord lead me through the day it's too treacherous for me I I start leading my own world my own way and I just make a huge mess of it by the end of the day there's me so I've ruined lives I've done this I've done that Lord just lead me today Lord Lord and I believe that's each person's prayer here tonight Lord that that we will be sensitive to your leadership and that that we would walk in your Perfect well and that Lord you're faithful to us Lord that that you don't leave us or forsake us you don't just think oh oh I try to tell them what's do they goal or but your Lord you have a desire for us and I believe your desire is strong that we would walk in your Perfect well and walk in your ways Lord so we just want to yes commit this the service to you tonight Lord and just bless us as we as we go this evening I just pray in Jesus name Amen let's just sing that song once there's any one other song learning to lean learning to lean learning to lean on Jesus we have that one in the finding more power than I've ever dreamed we're just saying that a few times in will dismiss if we have it who knows that song you know it's not there I'm sorry you know who knows it okay you know it sing let if you don't know it's a nice here we go yeah good learning [Music] learning oh gee fine and Oh [Music] I [Music] [Music]
