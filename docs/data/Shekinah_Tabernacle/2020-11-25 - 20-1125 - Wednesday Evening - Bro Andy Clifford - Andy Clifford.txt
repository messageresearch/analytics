pulpit i invite you lord jesus to where i'm standing and lord i'm sure lord that the people will invite you to where they're standing to their pew to their place to their situation for you are the one that can deliver you are the one that can heal you are the one that can lord overcome all things and you have overcome all things you've overcome the world and we believe lord that that you overcome these things that we can overcome because faith is the victory that overcomes the world and we believe lord jesus that we're serving a god who is rich in mercy who has overcome these things and has made a way for us to walk in your footsteps to climb the ladder of the jacobs ladder that you paved and anchored on the earth for us lord and we just want to look unto you tonight lord as we sung we turn our eyes to you now lord we turn our eyes to the only one that can really help us tonight we turn our hearts to you not just our eyes lord father because the eye can lie but the heart lord the soul we believe from our heart tonight that that there is a captain here that can help us there's a captain here that can set us free if we're bound there's a captain here that can lead us further if we're stuck oh lord there's a captain that can find us if we're lost oh lord i call on you tonight lord i believe lord you've got a word for your people and i pray lord that you administer that word in the way that you want it according to your heart and your desire and i just father asked that every spirit that is contrary would be bound in the name of jesus christ and i pray lord that you would take control of every spirit in this place that lord you would order this a service that leaves human control and stays in the control of the holy ghost i just ask you these things father and thank you and praise you in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah amen god bless you amen it is a privilege and an honor to be here tonight and i just want to thank brother ben for the opportunity and it's just you know no [Laughter] as as everyone always says it's very nerve-wracking but the lord is with us amen and we pray until we find the butterflies get in a row and then we stopped praying amen is that right hallelujah amen god bless you musicians thank you amen okay well praise god it's good to be here in the house of the lord and tonight we have a slideshow hallelujah amen so um yeah praise the lord can you turn in your bibles to revelation chapter 12 verses 10 and 11. tonight we want to speak on a subject called someone's going to be free someone's going to be free if i stand the right tone you'll understand the context of where i'm coming from someone is going to be free right there is some group somewhere that is going to be free amen hallelujah for all eternity amen hallelujah why not you amen hallelujah amen hallelujah we're going to read a few passages here that describe that group amen hallelujah let me just drive this does that work oh hold on there we go revelation 12 10 and 11. it says here and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven i like to highlight that word loud i think it's worthy of like highlighting something made them loud man oh my god now is come you know now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down hallelujah which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death so that's going to encapsulate the whole thought tonight amen amen that's powerful we'll never touch the sides of it but we'll just have a little joy in the lord amen let's go to the next one here sorry it's small that looks bigger at home it says here and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and fine linen clean and wiped for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god may god add his blessings to his word you may be seated amen hallelujah this is a group that i i believe that there this is the group that's going to be free right so somebody's going to be free there has been an atonement made there has been a king come a captain come and pay for it all he's paved the way so that there can be a people that is free right to be completely free from everything that sin has brought on the earth amen so there is somebody that's going to receive that freedom amen why not you why not you amen now i'm speaking in a general term because there's many free people all right so don't think i'm saying that you're not free if you are free praise god amen but i believe that you can be more free amen hallelujah because see you're in a body that is natural see this natural body well everyone falls under the category of being more free that can be more free because one day you'll be free from this body amen and then you'll be totally free hallelujah so there is a people that will definitely be in a group definitely rejoicing definitely shouting and they all shouted for joy amen they were all delivered they were all completely set free and that group is a reality amen who wants to be part of that group who's going to be there amen faith is the victory that overcomes this world amen whatever obstacle ever comes to you don't try and figure it all out don't try and just reason it all away don't compromise to it just have faith and apply that faith in the one that made the way and the one that passed through selfishness and the one that passed through prejudice and the one that passed through all rebellion all witchcraft all hatred and malice and envy and jealousy the one that pierced through and made away put your faith in him and he will deliver you every time under any circumstance as long as you believe just have faith have faith in them in the face of hopelessness have faith in the faith of defeat when you're even on the ground have faith because you'll get back up the lord will bring you back up amen have faith have faith in god hallelujah remember who you're having faith in amen sometimes we get caught up in ourself in our own faith and do we believe enough and we forget who we're actually believing in right you know we get caught up on man i just you're praying and the devils i mean the devil's there at every prayer right telling you you don't you're not gonna get it he's busy but don't worry about that you remind those thoughts come to you you remind the devil actually my god's stronger than you my god is faithful my god when i pray he promised me he would keep his promises and so i'm gonna have faith i don't care what the devil's telling me actually i'm just gonna start testifying and you start sharing what the lord has done for you amen and if it gets real bad then you just open up revelation chapter 20. go to verse 10 and you tell him where he's going he'll soon disappear hallelujah oh my okay well praise the lord amen amen these people will conquer over all of this world of darkness and sin and all of its attributes everything that has held people back i'm going gonna read a couple of things here i just want you before i go there i just want you now to remember who you're putting your faith in and his power and his ability and how much he's conquered how much has he conquered he's conquered all amen he came down from the highest place went to the lowest place looked up to the shortest man in the lowest city in the world and then he was raised up so that he had to look down on heaven and he let captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so that we could have victory so that we could be free so that we could have joy amen and so when something comes to you you can remember this he has conquered it he has completely conquered it it's finished it's conquered and you can conquer two just by believing and hold on to it hold on to it don't let go don't just oh yeah i've come up the front i've had my prayer and forget about it no no no hold on you can have it the devil will tell you it's not going to come now it's going to come in a few years or it might come at a camp no happen now he conquered already he didn't conquer at the next camp hey man he'll conquer there too because he's the i am he's always conquered amen he's always in victory he is the ever-present victory amen the ever-present conquering victory amen the ever-present deliverer so that there's a people that can escape the house of hell and shout delivered i'm delivered who's delivered amen i'm delivered hallelujah hallelujah amen so just think when i if i say something and it's like oh that's my uh you know the devil has a right punch on on us right and you've got to cover that with prayer so i'm just going to say a few things but then it might bring it up to the surface and it might just get shot in the head amen that's why i'm saying these right we don't want a glory and sinful uh attributes but let's just we're just gonna we're not gonna glory in it we're gonna expose it tonight so don't if i read something that's you're struggling with right now or maybe you're struggling with some of them many of them right because you're in the flesh in this body but i just tell you that don't just clam up tonight don't clam up because somebody's going to be free somebody's going to be free and you want to be part of that somebody right hallelujah amen identify yourself right now with it don't don't just make it so solid in your mind right now in your heart say lord that's me amen can everyone just say that's me amen say delivered amen hallelujah all right sorry i don't know if anyone can see this now but i'm just going to say read it out whether you see it so you know it says here you're going to be free from slavery from bondage from lust from fear from insecurity from jealousy from ill fame from depression obsession bitterness anger hatred laziness rejection and the fear of rejection and the fear of man and the fear of all these things it's just trapping people and the reason for let's just carry on sorry loneliness free from suicidal tendencies free from chemical imbalances because of a broken spirit free from dry bones in your own life who wants dry bones nobody wants dry bones we've heard a prophecy but prophesied over your dry bones it's not a valley of death anymore amen it's an army of the living god you've been prophesied over there's a word gone over your life that word has brought life back to you now faith overcomes everything that tries to bring you down to a dry bone condition and the way it comes to a dry bone condition is a broken spirit and how does it get a broken spirit but only if you get ensnared in the certainties of babylonian worship and all of the media and everything out there to ensnare your life to blind your eyes and actually will read in a vision where the prophet seen a people that were under that and it looked like they had cancers all over their eyes you see it's a very very carcinogenic thing and all the things i'm reading here that devil has got ways to bring you into it even real true believers can be ensnared in babylonian witchcraft rebellion loneliness depression fear all those things why by your spirit through your mind through your eyes your ears through the channels to get to your spirit to break it because a broken spirit dries the bones what does that do it brings your body into a chemical imbalance what does that do it makes you feel uncomfortable what does it do it makes you feel like you need something it makes you want instant gratification and because you're in that state when you pray you don't feel very good and then you trust your feelings and then you go what the heck i'm just going to go and watch something and then you go and get instant gratification and you start a snowball of destruction in your own life and that is a big problem a huge problem and that's how satan gets to the mind he starts to get to your eyes he starts to put cancer over your eyes and you can only half see and you sit in the church and it's and you're only getting half you're only getting a little bit but there's more somebody's gonna be free somebody's gonna be free amen are you that somebody why not you why not me why not there's no reason why not whosoever will whosoever will let them come and drink at the fountains of the waters of life freely and be washed by the water of the word take the crust off we serve a god that can heal cancer amen and maybe there's a babylonian cancer on your eye tonight that's stopping you from seeing stopping you from catching it you know because remember it all boils down to fault right thought i know it sounds very simple but god's thoughts are not our thoughts right they're way bigger and if you catch a thought of god it'll change your life forever the thoughts of god but you see if your eyes are coast uh crusted and if you you're down in a in a dungeon you can't grasp it it's just not you're not in that place to grasp it but you see god can bring you up god can bring you out of that god will bring you out of that because somebody's going to be free and it's going to be you you're going to be free you claim it tonight if you're struggling with something tonight claim your freedom tonight it's for you it is for you whatever it is the devil tells you it's so hard it's just such a big thing i'm going to have it all my life that's absolute lie absolute lie you don't have to be ruled by no sin you don't have to be ruled by no instant gratification i think i need a drink okay you don't have no one has to be ruled you know the devil's got a of counterfeit all of this is because people haven't tapped in to god's thoughts them tapped into god's joy they haven't tapped into the the peace and i know we probably sound like a broken record we always say it right that's so good it's so wonderful the children you hear it for all your life and then one day you taste one day it becomes real and you really have joy you really have peace and then you go why did i wait so long why did i wait all my life and i just sat in church bored and then all of a sudden one day the one that we talked about comes to your pew because you change your attitude because you finally when you know what i'm wasting my time here trying to make myself happy by all this stuff out there but it doesn't really hold you in a real state of joy and happiness it's just just just a temporal thing just while you're out there having the fun it's fine but the real the real thing the real joy the real love comes from the one that made it right isn't that logical we think of you know people say that faith is not logical i think it's more logical because what is logic right it's just satan's education it's satan saying this because of this and that because of that right taught us all our lives and we become so acclimatized to what he says is logical but actually no god is logical that's real logic heavenly faith logic if i believe and it happens that's my logic amen is that your logic amen you can't you can't this is a supernatural god is supernatural you're supernatural we come from him and we're going back to him so therefore let's become patriotic for the kingdom that we belong to amen stand for its laws stand for its values stand for its culture amen stand oh my be humble and proud of it amen amen it changes the way that you you know the devil tries to put fear on you make you embarrassed make you not want to share who you really are you know but just be be yourself we're on the winning time amen what can go wrong amen free from suicidal thoughts from chemical imbalances from sin as a as a whole indifference and rebellion and oh there's so many these things that we can be free from amen hallelujah someone's going to be free hey man amen i want to read this quote before i read it see we have a modern-day babylonian prison and this this i wasn't even looking for something like that but that popped up and i thought mate it's like encapsulating the what happens this is what happens pictorially and far more this is not gathering at all but just a little taste of what's happening what's happening when you are a prisoner in your own mind a prisoner in your own mind and really caught up in something that you don't really want to be caught up in but you get stuck in it right because of a broken spirit because you're spirit or something's wrong there's something in your life that needs to be delivered right there needs to be a deliverance there needs to be a healing there needs to be a change you can turn over a new leaf any day of the week you can have a new year's resolution that will not suffice the only thing that will suffice is when you have your visitation when jesus christ comes to you amen amen faith is the victory that overcomes your this jail amen faith is the victory you see but this is how the the babylonian kingdom works amen let's have a look at this quote here brother branham says i had a dream the other morning i don't dream very often i'm not a dreamer but i dreamed that i seen a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out and i said somebody told me said those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them you know how the devil puts a scarecrow in front of a real believer that's what he does because a real believer's got treasure i'll tell you young people anyone that doesn't have the holy ghost and even if you do have the holy ghost you should always respect true believers realize that there is treasure in that person and who am i if we really esteemed each other better than ourself right how much more of a blessing will we get out of fellowshipping right being around your brethren who are full of treasure you're full of treasure amen there's so much in each one it's like a well he said he said this he that believes on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water yeah do you know what that water is that water is the river of god do you know where that river of god comes from it comes from eternity it comes from his throne so you are an outlet for the river of god i mean let's not take that lightly you are a river outlet you're a spring oh my now brother branham says you know you know that spring and i'm just paraphrasing because i'm talking about a spring that spring will not make itself known where it's not wanted right because it takes faith to operate the spring in each other right and so if you really believe you know and you really understand the spirit of fellowship and you go to somebody you can have a glorious time a glorious time and you can even receive things that you need spiritually right distant fellowship a glorious time god just comes down i mean we hear about it all the time right you talk about the lord walking on the road to emmaus with your buddy and you're just having fellowship and he's just around and it's just glorious what is that it's a spring of water flowing hey man amen he said oh my and i seen this young fellow getting out of his shackle so i just let him alone i thought i'll just see what he does so when he got out he was a nice fellow and i seen others trying to get out now this is only a dream and i walked over this way and i seen a brother roy borders a very good friend of mine lives in california so you see now no i'm not saying that i understand everything that's being in this vision but there's a few things that make sense and if you see here here is a true believer right a believer that's in california right now well not right now but in this vision in this thing god is showing brother branham one of his good friends and he's in california what is california we understand california is the seat of satan right it's the babylonian second babylonian has everyone understand the prophecy in revelation chapter 18 how the millstone will be cast into the sea and we understand that in the choosing of the bride the prophet preached and he said that uh o capernaum capernaum and he says how los angeles the city of the angels you call yourself you shall be cast into the sea and the sea will all the way to the come up to the sultan sea which is a way inland basically saying that this is going to be the whole side of america is going to go in the ocean right and that's in revelation chapter 18. right at the prophecy of the second babylon there's two babylons one is in rome and one is in california these are two epicenters of lucifer's destruction of the human race religious and entertainment religious and political whatever you want to call it but there's two seats and so here we have a vision of a good friend of the of the prophet living in this place of satan's seat and he's looked like there was something wrong his eyes were half closed you see what i was saying before his eyes was half closed and great big maybe cancer or something over his eyes and someone was trying to pull me away from him i screamed brother borders in the name of the lord jesus snap out of that you see the prophet's heart went out for his good friends that were stuck in a babylonian condition with their eyes filmed over because of things that they were allowing into their life things that they were allowing into their family things that were going on that should not be going on but because a demon came down and wrapped itself around their reasoning channel and they lost the ability to reason with a godly conscience and i know firsthand how easy it is to sear your conscience and do things that you wouldn't normally do and you didn't used to do and yet you're a true believer god comes and fellowships with you and you have a glorious time in church and all of these things is going on but you're sinning but you're doing these things and it's keeping you with eyes half closed covered in cancer in vision right this is symbolic now this is good buddy in california in a babylonian condition stuck amen he says here and i and someone was trying to pull me you see now here the prophet had a heart for his friend come out snap out of it snap out of it but you see now god's gonna take him deeper or higher you see this vision gets it's like a liar it starts there and brother branham is now trying to deal with that he's just trying to deal with one person he's trying to deal with this one thing this one it's the fruit of sin he's trying to deal with that problem he's saying brother borders step out of it you know we want to say to each other snap out of it you can see something and you say snap out of it in your prayers and you just really want but sometimes you've got to go a little higher and watch this the lord takes the prophet higher he goes up a few layers until he gets to the very one that can do it hallelujah there's one that can do it amen we need to have some more supernatural prayer meetings we need to have some more supernatural fellowship supernatural encounters it is your inheritance saints you don't have to walk a natural christian life you don't have to you don't have to it is not your that's lots lot not your lot abraham had visitations amen you're the royal seed of abraham under a new covenant a new and living way not some shadow or not some ark or gold but a real living seventh seal revelation of jesus christ right excuse the terminology but this is the real real one they had an ark in the old testament but we've got the living one the what the person hallelujah comes down he prophesied in the fullness of his presence and you know you do not have to have a natural just a natural wandering walk you can have a poignant supernatural precise glorious walk with the lord regardless of the storms that are going on i'm preaching to myself because i'm always getting storms and the storms bring it down right you get down you don't feel good and you fail but it doesn't matter it doesn't that's just the that's just the daily grind right there's a bigger picture let's go to the bigger picture here hallelujah so you see he's now crying compassion sympathy whatever you want to call it to his friend come out of it snap out of it and we want to say that too you know we see something happening in our own life or in someone's life that we love and care about and you think step out of it but sometimes that's just not going to as it sees in the vision now remember it doesn't matter who says things in a vision it's god speaking he's causing those people to say those things in a vision right he says this and he just barely could speak he's saying brother branham it'll have to take something more than this i just can't grasp it brother branham i just can't grasp it because you see his eyes were filmed over where is that thing i couldn't get one that had so that was good enough you see there was something wrong with this vision something had happened to cause him to not be able to grasp it and i thought what is it what is it it's the lord it's the it's the it's what god it's his expression right it's the present truth it's the person speaking jesus is speaking jesus is doing jesus is unfolding prophecy jesus is fulfilling scripture can you grasp it does it impress you does it really move you or is it just nice information is that all it is or does it move you so deeply that you feel like you've just been you could just float away after a service and you just feel so moved maybe there's something in your life that's blocking that maybe you're in a prison in your mind oh i said oh brother borders and i love him and someone pulled me away and i looked and it was a lady standing over here that i when i was a little boy i used to haul groceries from the grocery store to the people and her name was mrs fenton and she lives in jeffersonville yet a personal friend of the wife and i and she said brother branham deliver us from this i said oh she said this is a house of hell and said you've been misunderstood and you misunderstood these people too said these are fine people and i looked over there and like a great big seller big walls down beneath a great big cave and great iron bars eight or ten inches thick oh my and people out of their mind twisted arms and legs beating their head like that this is god showing a vision right a dream this is god giving a dream this is the condition that babylon puts his people in this is the condition of someone that's stuck in a babylonian trap and their eyes is filmed over and god sees them as broken twisted limbs and and they can't you see and they're banging their heads because why madness absolute craziness this is what it brings and she was crying saying deliver the people brother branham said help us we're in trouble she herself i know her she belongs to the the church of christ or the christian church called the church of the brethren and uh we belong to the church of the brethren too amen and i believe that you see we're going to go a little higher i looked around and said i wished i could i wish i could you see we so desperately would want to see everybody free we want to see our young people free we want to see our children with the holy ghost we want to see our teenagers right up here just joy of the lord follow the holy ghost amen the gifts operating in their life and call to the ministry got a burden for the youth and the burden just to go out there and addicted themselves to the ministry it becomes your life you know i was so moved by that that service on sunday night by brother john anderson that's been that's been one of the biggest burdens of my whole everything i think with everything that i could imagine about that being it's everything this is everything god is everything the ministry and family and it's everything all that other stuff is so secondary i'm not going to say too much because you know how i feel about that but there is something happen to these people to be so addicted to the presence of god just so wanting to be part of it they just want to be around the christians they want to be ministering they want to be involved with the word they want to be doing god's service they want to be with the people they want to be fellowshipping they want to be in church they want to be doing something they got a burden they want to go home they got they just they're just alarmed because of what they met the pillar of fire they met something they got something and i can guarantee you if you just meet that same one he changes everything he changes everything that's that makes the difference and i was praying so much when brother john was preaching lord just come and call these young people come and visit them lord and give them their own reality their own burden and that's what it takes and i just encourage you young people seek the lord he's a person he can come to you and change you you've got to invite him he will do it hallelujah he'll come to you where you're at david said i made my bed if i even if i made my bed in the lowest house oh my he will be there and he will take you from there amen and he will put you on his shoulders and take you up oh my glory to god he says here i looked around and i said i wish i could and go on looking around and my little bitty body and them great big iron bars iron represents rome roman imprisonments the roman beast that rules the earth through babylonian witchcraft and powers those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars were sitting close together and i looked and they were beating their head like they were out of their mind these are real fine true people you watch what he says he says they're true people real fine people real believers that they're stuck stuck maybe you're stuck tonight you feel like you're stuck you don't have to be because somebody's gonna be free somebody's gonna be free don't let this go over your head it might be so simple but somebody's going to be free and whatever you've got whatever's hurting you or keeping you down that doesn't have to remain don't leave the service with the same thing you came with if you know if i read out something in that list then it was like a prescription that's and you you you think man that thing's been troubling me tonight tonight and you can say as the song not today if that thing's troubling you not today not today and for no longer right hallelujah and i seen some lights flickering around in there and i looked up and there stood the lord jesus with a light of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me he said deliver those people and he went away and i thought well how can i deliver them i just want to stop there remember now he's gone from seeing the problem in brother borders as friend then he's seen to another lady now the lady tried to commission him right she tried to and they're not in a bad thing she just tried to say oh brother branham help us but you see now he's getting higher and higher and higher and sooner the commission is going to come from the right place right and then it makes a difference this is where we're getting to this is what makes the difference and i want to read that again it says and i looked up and there stood the lord jesus with the lights of rainbow around him amen we know that that's revelation chapter 10 right he came down with a rainbow about his head right and he cried and it was seven thunders that came out and the revelation of the word the voice of god in the last days to sound out to turn our hearts back to the way it was in the beginning of the fathers the pentecostal fathers you see that this is the one that is now he's like gone right up to the very one that would come down into the age the one that would come down as an answer to lucifer's hell on earth the one and he is the one that you realize when you catch that who it is that is here and where he stands as the supreme authority over all sin over every trouble over everything that will trouble you here is one that stands amen and his commission hallelujah house of hell he says brother uh the lord he says and he was looking right straight to me and he said deliver those people god said it deliver those people see he made a way he purchased it his body took all of the sin of the human race it took it all it broke its back it broke its power that lost its power completely amen so when you are troubled by something and it rises you and it just keeps remaining and you just can't get rid of it it doesn't have to be that way there is faith in you there is faith in you to overcome it right now amen it's broken i can just declare that it's broken there is no power in sin anymore you don't have to remain under any bondage no bondage nothing it's all completely obliterated it's dealt with it was completely removed his back is broken completely broken amen because his body took it his body was broken the atonement was not in vain it was perfect and it's finished already you're healed you're restored you have been predestined you have been glorified because you were justified hallelujah you see when he raised up into heaven hallelujah disappeared in a cloud it was to prove our justification to prove that the human race had been accepted again into heaven he was our man he is our man amen he is our kinsman he went up that means you will go up because you were in him when he went up oh my is that too much is that too much oh my he took you hallelujah amen oh my man he says deliver those people you know you think here is the mighty angel here is the one that's come to answer the very trouble of satan's eden to rescue you to bring him out of the darkest age and he's there and he says deliver these people you know he says that but behind those words is power behind those words is the atonement behind those words is total utter deliverance because somebody's gonna be free there is a people in eternity rejoicing shouting and i believe i'm looking at them right now right now i don't understand it but right now that's why we can say satan not today not today because i'm already there hallelujah i'm already up there i'm already rejoicing i'm already shouting hallelujah all the sons of god shouted all of them hallelujah they finally grasped it oh my that was a bit naughty but it was true they finally grasped it in its enormity and its magnificence and its glory because of this flesh it taints our perception it takes how glorious the word is it's why the prophet cried in the church age book are we sufficiently sufficiently impressed how can you be here you think oh my but something moves you and you lose yourself and the prophet says he crossed over you know david he said when david was dancing around the ark it said he crossed over i thought my i want to cross over you just get so beside yourself oh my you can't handle this world anymore and you get you just start vibrating too fast hey man you just start going too fast and you just spin into another dimension i believe i will do that one day forever oh my oh he crossed over oh my he lost all self styles he said he lost self styles you know we have a style it's generally forged by our experiences and our family traits and our culture and all those things we've become inadvertently which means you don't mean to do it it just happens uh a patriot for our own limitations and cultures and whatever we are as a human naturally but then there's something inside that's fighting its way out oh my hallelujah you can make this whole thing personal right this cage can be the house of hell and it really is depends what level you want to look at it you can look at it on all levels if you make it personal you see the cage of your flesh is going to break under a prophecy when the prophet got commissioned by this one here we're reading you know if you read between the lines and you get under inspiration you can see some things here that really show you the intent of god the plan of god the program of god the what's going to happen this is a this is a deep this is a very deep dream but it's also very simple and it's also very applicable very practical and it's yours so you need to take it this is this is the first time it's come for me to say it in a service but i'll say it because it never comes i think man i'd love to say that one day but you know israel i was driving one day in the lord he um i was just driving and and i was just pondering over israel and their struggle natural israel now in their struggle and how they i mean they're just such it's only the lord that can keep them there right and if you watch all the videos and all of the all the documentaries of how they came back to the land it's all supernatural but yet natural god works in supernaturally natural ways and the world like the devil's trying to delete the history delete their identity and the palestinians which is really the philistines the ancient philistine those they're just trying to you know use the political agenda and they're trying to work on on the human sympathy and the devils right there and the whole world's coming against them but you see they have an identity and this identity cannot be removed from them so i was driving and i've been to israel so i this is why i was thinking about it and i thought it was just so it's just so different from here and probably most of our countries unless you come from a country that's got lots of ancient civilizations there but you see when they and i because i'm in construction i'm thinking of building and and i thought of israel and how when they build they do excavation and they find like solomon's porch or they find something that relates to their history right in the old testament they find something and in the world no matter how much the philistines come against them with political powers and with all these reasonings and all this stuff they cannot delete the history they cannot take their identity because they dig down into the old testament under the construction and they find their history and they say that's me i can see myself in ray here but i can see myself in ruth i can see myself and david i can see myself in solomon i can see myself because a prophet came a master uh excavator an archaeologist who got commissioned by this one he got commissioned by this one with a rainbow about his head a man with an anointing and a book that came open hallelujah and it came open and it said dig here and when you dig there you'll see yourself and the devil will never be able to take it away from you he will never be able to refute you because you can see yourself right there you can see yourself there's no you know my how glorious it is when you see yourself right through the old testament get down and find who you really are because we have an open book and the open book opened many books it opened the book of the word to reveal jesus christ but it opened the book of your own life to reveal who you are and it opened the book of every life of every believer written in the bible and then you read their life and it's no longer a mystery it's you it's the word hallelujah it's you and the devil can't fight you he can't take away your identity that's why i encourage you you know young people we listen to the services and we hear about all these types but just remember this there's power in them there is power in them to to prove your identity so don't do away with the old testament the devil will do away with it he doesn't want it all these modern churches out there they think it's not even needed anymore oh my my oh i won't even say who it was but i've talked to family and they're like why are you reading the old testament i'm like going i'm not even going to even start this conversation you know what's the point where are you going to get to but unless there's election there but i just love that he came he wants you to know who you are he wants you in victory he wants you to have happiness he wants you to have joy he wants you to have peace he wants you to have a supernatural life all of you everyone not just an academic reality he wants a supernatural reality right now don't leave the service until you've got a supernatural reality you can have it whatever you ask believing you shall have it just ask him now lord i pl give me a supernatural reality you might go through some trials you will go for some trials oh my and you don't falter under those see jesus says satan has desired that he may sift you as wheat but don't worry i've prayed that thy faith will fail not well and then the lord in john 17 pray for us that we would be kept right through every trial amen hallelujah deliver those people i just can't get past it i'll go and he went away and i thought well how could i deliver them i haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so i said hallelujah house of hell give way to the name of jesus and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running and screaming delivered delivered that's why i said say it deliver it because you are part of that amen you got set free from babylon he said he called to the age come out of him my people you heard the voice you heard house of hell give way to the name of jesus the name of jesus is more than a title the name of jesus is the revelation of the word made manifest right when the word make is made manifest and the light shines on you know there's a revelation of the name it's a revelation of who he is hallelujah because a name identifies a person not a title to a person it's more than that and identifies a person amen and screaming at the top of their voice and they was all delivered god doesn't do a half job he won't do a half job in your life just have faith have faith just have faith in god hallelujah the definition of bondage a tenure or service of a villain surf or slave a state of being bound usually by compulsion as of law or mastery it's quite deep we're not going to go through it but just think about it captivity is another definition servitude or subjugation to a controlling person or force that is bondage bondage a state of being bound usually by compulsion something that is compelling you're being compelled by a force compelled by a lust compelled by a habit compelled by a need for comfort a need for comfort compelled young ones at school by a need to be accepted who feels that that you feel this desire young people most of the you feel like there's a pressure i need to be accepted and when you're not accepted you're hurt right that's the world satan stuffed up his own kingdom because it's a kingdom of non-acceptance and it drives the people to do things that they don't want to do and unfortunately believers get caught up in the same trap and it's a cycle of death it takes you down because you can never you'll try to earn acceptance you can't you see but let me tell you and listen very carefully you are already accepted in the beloved you're accepted in christ no matter what how good or bad or whatever you're accepted you're accepted for who you are not what you can do you're accepted in the brethren because of you you don't have to be or try amen you don't have to perform or put on a personality to be cool you don't have to you are accepted totally thoroughly accepted you you never have to earn that rebecca you don't have to earn it you don't have to earn acceptance in your friends in christ if you have friends in the world unfortunately they don't have god's love in them it's it's conditional so friendship in the world is conditional and it's based on performance based on what you can bring what can you bring to this relationship and it makes you it compels you by compulsion it compels you it drives you to do simple things to say a simple thing who can be the baddest who's watched the worst movie who's who's done the worst thing who's played the r16 rap video game who's done this because you're trying to be accepted you're trying to be included and what it is is hovering over that group of friendships as a demon and that demon is bringing a son or daughter of god out of their position as a child so that you can be acceptable remember in christ you cannot earn acceptance you are accepted and that's at full stop eternally oh my you know that's a real revelation and i and i just encourage the groups of young friends in the church don't try and make each other accept you or don't try and make someone be accepted by you accept them love them unconditionally amen they might have times where they say something stupid or whatever just love them anyway be accepting that's that's more than what we realize it's more than what we realize and we've all been through many of us have been through the peer pressure of school and the peer pressure of belonging you belong you already belong you belong in christ you belong in the greatest team the greatest family this is our family and we're accepted we didn't have to earn it and we're from very different paths very different cultures very different but we have become part of one body amen amen part of one body what is freedom definition of freedom this says here the quality or state of being free the absence of necessity the the absence of coercion that means to be forced to be coerced with fertility something that's stronger than you or or pretends to be stronger than you if you believe the lie you can have a tiny little little dog right let's just use a tiny little uh elf or whatever i don't know and a big strong but if that big strong man is gullible and that little elf says i'm stronger than you and that giant starts getting scared he's going to be overcome by that little thing right but that could just go boop but he's believed the lie that's the devil young people that's the devil he is so weaker than you not because of who you or what you've got in your own strength but it's christ you are a son and daughter of god amen you have authority and the devil hates it and when you realize you've got authority when you realize that when you speak and it happens and the devil can't do that he ain't got no spoken word you've got the spoken word you got the spoken word it's in you and he hates it because you're going to speak things that they're going to happen because somebody's going to be free and you're going to be part of that somebody amen we're just gonna get freer and freer and freer and freer amen hallelujah liberation from slavery look absence of absence of coercion the absence of constraint man i wish i had time to get into this the absence and this is the liberation from slavery the liberation from restraint deliberation from the power of another to come now i won't even get too far into this at all but you need to be liberated from the power of darkness so that you can be accepted as a love slave to christ right the human being must be a slave to something you must serve something you there's no void whatever you are right now whatever condition you're in whatever you think how well you can do it you're a slave to something or someone amen whether directly or indirectly whether it's through your own ideas you're a slave to some ideology why not be a slave to the one that loves your soul the one that will take you and give you joy be a slave to the right thing don't be a slave to some human concoction amen oh my sorry i'm gonna get i'm gonna get through this the quality or state of being exempt or released i like that you got diplomatic immunity amen hallelujah you're in your own little embassy all the devil's laws and what he says you can't you can amen because you're in your own embassy you've got your own law and that's his law you've got your own freedom diplomatic immunity complete diplomatic immunity if anyone does not know what that means come and see me hallelujah that's very powerful that's a whole sermon in itself diplomatic immunity you know okay i'll just just quickly if an ambassador comes from china right and the an ambassador comes over to new zealand when he's in his house it's chinese law through and thorough it's china in new zealand and he he can do whatever he likes according to chinese law new zealand law unless he comes and breaks the new zealand law on the outside then there will be probably trouble between the countries you see now that's where it gets a little bit more interesting because we we are under a diplomatic immunity for heaven and when we come out here we start breaking satan's laws and then there becomes a fight between heaven and hell because you're breaking his laws you're defying his laws you're walking on the water amen you're walking on the storms you are called to walk on the storms you are called to walk stable stable and that starts with your spirit that starts with you and i know your spirit never going to be converted but your spirit can be healthy your spirit can get healed like your body you say oh i've got a broken arm or i've got a cancer or whatever and you go out for prayer and you get oil and you get healed and you leave your spirit in a condition of cancer think about that real deep now real deep treat it the same just because of physical pain you make it more of an urgency but then you live with a squatter in your land you live with a squatter in your human spirit and it becomes a tributary lives in your own life and all it's doing is it's blocking you from the spoken word it's blocking you from rapturing faith you've got rapturing faith in you but there's enemies stopping it now i'm gonna say something every one of them enemies has got a number on its head cross hairs hallelujah they've got heavenly crosses heavenly crosses every enemy in your life everyone take refuge in this thought it's such a glorious thing rest assured that by the time we go there ain't going to be no squatters in your lap hey man little by little faith is a victory that overcomes the world and somebody someone's going to be free is that you i'm going to be free amen i'm getting freer and freer and free every day every day i just keep getting more and more free hey man when i fail i just get more and more free when i have a victory i get more free when the devil comes at me like a flood i just get more free hey man who's who's with me do you just keep getting more free amen why because you're on the winning team and if you're not on the winning team get on the winning team as we sing that song the old ship of zion get on board it's landed all these people it's landed noah's landed brother branham as land of john the baptist has landed everyone that's gone on it's landed them we're in heaven hallelujah exempt or released usually from something onerous and i looked up onerous and it says here involving imposing or constituting a burden troublesome amen oh my hallelujah freedom is deliverance from that having legal obligations that outweigh the advantages whenever you get into a deal with the devil come on he's just a real businessman he's a one-sided businessman you know you got businessmen that do a good deal for everybody right that's our motto everyone wins and it works and it's sustainable but then you've got businessmen out there but it's all about their business and they don't care who they're going to burn they burn bridges they make bad deals and it's all about how much they can get they don't give us anything about um anyone else they just want to make sure they're the one that gets all that's the devil's business man that's the devil's tactic on your contract that you ever make with him you make a deal you might not realize you're making a deal but anytime you go out of the word into something that is not of god into something that is from the tree of knowledge you are making a contract with the devil who no one if i said who wants to make a contract with the devil i'm sure no one will put their hand up but if we under inspiration could discern and it was like if something rose up i'm sure hands would go up that's making a contract with the devil right now or doing a deal with the devil you've got to be careful that's why we must be led by the spirit of god we must have divine leadership leading us and when we go should i look at this book should i watch this should i read this should i play this should i go to that group should i go be part of that group at school should i play that music before i do it i'm going to say lord is this your will lord will this help me because if it doesn't we go back to this this will be your eyes spiritually speaking and you'll become a prisoner in your own head and you know what you'll do you'll go crazy and you'll start smashing your head and you do crazy stuff that's how the lord sees it because it's a babylonian trap and you see the longer the devil can keep our young people in these traps and keep people under some regime it just delays things it just brings things down it just you know but we are overcomers you are an overcomer and if there's something that's happened in your life whoever you may be whatever age you may be tonight don't leave don't leave until that's gone have tenacity have resolve because faith is the victory that overcomes the world i am going to close man i'm just going to skim this i'm not going to read it but you see we've been called and see jesus sent out people to call to a marriage supper because in the marriage is your deliverance in the marriage is your healing in the marriage in the marriage is your freedom and the marriage is your redemption right so he's calling people and here it comes down to something very precious to me and precious to you you see he made his way down this is the greatest calling there's nothing greater to be called to the marriage suffer of the lamb right so here you have the golden ticket this is everything that humans live for right it's this this is the one moment and all of creation all of redemption all of it this invitation you have an invitation everybody tonight every one of us has an invitation you are being called to the wedding supper and you see you went through all these different echelons of society until he got down to the misfits got down to the down and outs got down to the highways and the hedges what is it about these people that make them candidates for the eternity candidates for supernatural what is it what is it that makes them of equality what is it about them what is it why is it that these people you know in a general sense just get so beat down and and and they've and god found these people in such a condition that they were down and out and broken and he found them and they were the ones who said i'll come and really god doesn't make mistakes they were god's people they were elect they are elect and yet they're just full of they're just down and out here they are what is it do you know what it is the devil out to get them the devil want to beat them down he wants to beat you down and if you walk out of the protection of god walk out from the blood the things he will do the things he can do he's a advantage taker don't let him take advantage of you amen amen so there's a people called to this marriage supper says go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled you see here it says in romans 7 and we're talking now about this this this woman who says no you're not breathing for i speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives for the woman which hasn't husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also have become dead to the law by the body of christ you are dead to the law because of the body of christ oh my the body of christ took all sin upon himself broke it so that you could be free from the law but no not only that but that brought you into a place where you could come into fellowship with the very one but said to brother branham deliver those people you have been connected to the very one that said that and he's got the power to deliver you he's got the power to set you free he's got the power to heal all he's healed all sickness he's healed it all because he dealt with sin and sin has been done away with it says here that you should be married to another even to him so here is a death to self that's why you should never doubt the power of the altar the altar is the place of sacrifice the altar is the place where christ died for everything and the body of death is there to say you all sin has been broken now he's calling his people to come and fall on that altar and die to themself a living sacrifice why so that the divine influence of grace can come down and change your life and tonight is a life changing for you if you believe it if you want it young people if you want it it's for you tonight to change everything to give you a new operating system who knows what an operating system is you know on a computer a computer has an operating system we're born with a very bad one like 95 dos but amen we've got a upgrade we've got an upgrade that came from the mind of god and goes back to the mind of god that's how much better it is for those that know about computers for those that don't know i'm very sorry even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit under death but now we are delivered can everyone just say delivered we are delivered just say it just just declare it i am delivered i am delivered i came under an influence amen hallelujah it wasn't alcohol it was holy ghost hallelujah and he showed me that i am delivered that i am free that i can be married now why because all my past got blown down all my past came under a divine influence and that influence wasn't good for my past that influence wasn't good for sin that ruled in my spirit that influence is not good it's for that stuff it's good for one thing it's good to give god glory it's good to give god the praise it's good to raise up a standard in my life that i may be able to live because you see without it all you do is struggle struggle struggle up and down and emotional and all of those things until you get stabilized by the one that can remove your past but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you see this house who knows whose house this is yes i don't know if it really is but we'll pretend it is still standing they call it rahab's house hey it probably is god doesn't have monuments that fall down when he keeps them up all right no matter how old it is amen that's your testimony amen when god gives you a testimony no matter all the age and all the storms and everything of life it will remain as a testimony amen you see this is the same thing rahab and you can identify yourself in her you see she had a life that she was stuck under the law of necessity satan's kingdom had bound her and coerced her and kept her in the life that she lived of ill fame it can't do she had to do it she had to do it because she had no way of income she was supporting all these people the devil kept her coerced in a sinful state and there was no way out and you may think tonight that there's no way out of your condition but you can call that thing as a bluff because there is a captain come down into your land amen you see when she was there shuttling sterling her she heard the stories she heard the stories of the bible she thought wow this is different something real is happening i can hear there's a god that's coming on the scene there's someone doing something real i want that no god they didn't hear her with a voice or whatever godhead
