[4:47] call anyone woman of God any of the
[4:49] sisters does he ever say
[4:51] that
[4:52] no not that he has to I'm just
[4:56] wondering but uh you know
[4:59] there's power in
[5:00] confession because Satan's always trying
[5:02] to tell you that you're not you know and
[5:05] it's powerful when you tell someone that
[5:06] they are like woman of God woman of God

[5:12] you think yeah I actually am a woman of
[5:13] God I am a man of God and you you know

[33:18] evening God bless
[33:21] you good to you sister Hannah alatan God
[33:25] bless you good to see you
[33:31] um yes um I've got I've got a title this
[33:34] evening but I was I was just thinking um
[33:37] today um so generally I come once a
[33:40] quarter to Wellington um and we have
[33:43] customer
[33:44] meetings and it's just like meetings
[33:47] that runs whole
[33:49] day and you sit there and you get so
[33:52] bored and you get so tired and I wasn't
[33:55] looking forward to the meetings of the
[33:58] day but I was looking forward to the
[34:00] meeting of tonight you know it's just so
[34:02] wonderful to gather
[34:04] together with a people that loves the
[34:07] Lord
[34:09] Jesus and uh you know
[34:11] just we have that that
[34:15] kindred spirit amongst us it's it's so
[34:19] good this this evening when I just
[34:20] stepped in and I as I walked in I just
[34:23] looked and I seen the brother at the
[34:25] back the Deacon and I just I just I
[34:28] can't explain how I felt brother the
[34:30] goodin but it's just wonderful wonderful
[34:32] to be here um not really sure exactly
[34:36] how things are going to go this evening
[34:37] but we just trust the Lord um so i' I've
[34:41] got a title just a thought um and I'm
[34:43] not sure if I'm going to hit the thought
[34:45] but uh it's just something that the Lord
[34:47] has been dealing with me for a while um
[34:50] and uh I'm going to the title says you
[34:54] have a power within you to overcome
[34:58] amen simple simple thought you have a
[35:01] power within you to
[35:04] overcome and the inspiration behind it
[35:08] and I I've got it written out it says
[35:10] here Lord Jesus please give us
[35:15] Revelation to know this amen because you
[35:18] know how it is many times we we we we we
[35:22] hear these powerful
[35:25] words um you know the min would come and
[35:28] they would give us these these these
[35:30] words that that really does something to
[35:33] us but many times you know I believe
[35:37] that God has got to come and give us
[35:40] that that divine revelation because once
[35:43] we we we we catch the revelation of what
[35:47] God is trying to tell us then I believe
[35:51] it
[35:52] automatically has an impact on how we
[35:56] live that's right
[35:58] um it has an impact on how we make
[36:02] decisions amen you know the word
[36:07] revelation it's about um you know if you
[36:10] go if you just go and and go and read
[36:12] the church change book um brother
[36:14] brandham would say you know the word
[36:15] revelation the Greek word is
[36:18] apocalypse but he would say the mean the
[36:21] the the meaning behind the word
[36:25] revelation is to un Veil something yeah
[36:30] that's previously been
[36:34] hidden so it is it's it's
[36:37] something that's always been there
[36:41] yeah but it takes what they say
[36:47] Revelation to come and maybe it's a
[36:50] maybe it's a sheet that's covering it
[36:53] Revelation is taking that sheet pulling
[36:57] it away way and
[37:00] revealing what's there amen and I
[37:04] believe that is what our Lord Jesus
[37:07] Christ
[37:09] constantly wants to do in our lives and
[37:15] he
[37:16] is doing it amen in our lives I was I
[37:20] was um spending some time with a friend
[37:23] uh just a couple of days ago and we were
[37:26] just going he's not a message believer
[37:29] he doesn't believe in William brandham
[37:31] and he he he believes in the Trinity he
[37:33] believes in three gods in one and all
[37:36] these sorts of things but the Lord
[37:38] allowed me just to sit with him and you
[37:41] know just talk about the
[37:44] scriptures and see how this one
[37:48] scripture links in with that scripture
[37:52] and uh you and as I'm talking to him and
[37:56] you know he's starting to see things and
[37:58] it's like lights is going on you know in
[38:00] his head kind of thing as I'm talking to
[38:03] him I'm saying Lord I am so
[38:07] thankful that father you came my way
[38:11] amen amen and you took scriptures
[38:16] Lord that's always been there right yeah
[38:21] hallu and what you did for
[38:25] me you opened up my
[38:31] understanding so that I could sit with
[38:34] this
[38:35] brother and we took we just took Malachi
[38:38] 4 and we took behold I'll send you
[38:41] Elijah the
[38:43] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[38:46] day of the
[38:48] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[38:51] fathers to the children yes and the
[38:55] hearts of the children to the the
[38:57] fathers and the Lord allowed us just to
[39:00] go into the
[39:02] scriptures and and we could see how
[39:05] Malachi 4 he agreed with me you know
[39:08] what actually yes it does talk about
[39:10] sending an Elijah and that Elijah is
[39:12] John the Baptist and then and then you
[39:16] know we could talk about how it talks
[39:19] how Behold our send you Elijah the
[39:21] prophet he'll turn the hearts of the
[39:23] fathers to the children and I told him I
[39:26] said if you look at it and and I said
[39:29] when when when when that scripture
[39:31] became fulfilled I said God pressed
[39:33] pause because there's another part of
[39:36] the scripture that still needed to be
[39:38] fulfilled but I could take him by
[39:41] Revelation to just the first part of
[39:44] John the Baptist and take him into the
[39:47] Book of Luke and point out that you know
[39:50] how the Scriptures it just balances out
[39:53] amen amen but it takes I believe
[39:56] revelation from
[39:59] God to reveal these
[40:03] precious mystery truths to us hallelujah
[40:08] right and I believe that we need to be
[40:10] willing and
[40:12] open to the Holy Ghost open to him Amen
[40:17] to reveal himself to us hallelujah
[40:21] because the more he
[40:23] reveals
[40:25] himself to us
[40:28] yeah and the more we see the Lord Jesus
[40:33] Christ in the
[40:35] word the more we see who we are in the
[40:43] word because remember you are the words
[40:47] in this
[40:50] book that's right I believe so brother
[40:53] Brandon would come and say the
[40:55] importance of
[40:58] Revelation by the
[41:01] spirit to a True
[41:04] Believer can never be
[41:09] overemphasized what that means is
[41:12] revelation is so
[41:15] important Hallelujah that it doesn't
[41:18] matter if Brother TZ comes here on
[41:21] Wednesday and tells you Revelation is
[41:24] important and then by Ben comes on
[41:27] Sunday and says Revelation is important
[41:31] and brother the Aran comes the next
[41:33] Wednesday and says Revelation is
[41:35] important doesn't matter how many times
[41:39] you know we we are told that but the
[41:41] brandom says it cannot be
[41:44] overemphasized
[41:46] Revelation means more to you and me than
[41:50] what we
[41:51] realize because like I said with
[41:55] Revelation it's it's it's showing us
[41:58] things that's always been there amen
[42:03] praise the Lord maybe we just didn't see
[42:06] it at the
[42:08] time and because we didn't see it at the
[42:13] time our lives that we
[42:16] lived lived according to what we had
[42:20] seen yeah true true but then when God
[42:25] comes and he Tak takes the things of our
[42:28] eyes Hallelujah and he shows us more of
[42:32] what is in the
[42:34] word
[42:36] automatically Our
[42:39] Lives has got to
[42:42] adjust to what he is
[42:46] revealing to us hallelujah right so you
[42:51] know the common the common scripture in
[42:53] the Bible which is in Matthew chapter 16
[42:58] where Jesus comes and he asks his
[42:59] disciples you know who do people say I
[43:01] am Etc and they say some say you are
[43:04] this and some say you are that but then
[43:07] Jesus comes with that question and says
[43:09] but who do you say I am amen and you
[43:14] know what that
[43:17] question has to come to each of us
[43:22] individually amen amen as we sit here
[43:27] if it hasn't come to you yet it will
[43:31] come to
[43:32] you because you need to
[43:37] know who he
[43:42] is amen so the question is who do you
[43:47] say I
[43:49] am and then Peter comes and Peter says
[43:53] Thou Art the
[43:55] Christ the son of of the Living
[43:59] God and we know when we look into the
[44:02] scripture
[44:04] today we can recognize that something
[44:08] Supernatural happened to
[44:10] Peter right so that Peter could come
[44:14] with that
[44:16] answer and then Jesus when Peter tells
[44:20] him and says Thou Art the Christ the son
[44:24] of the Living God Jesus answered and
[44:27] said unto him
[44:29] Simon you are
[44:34] blessed see de blessed art thou Simon B
[44:40] Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not
[44:44] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[44:47] which is in
[44:49] heaven and you know as I'm looking at
[44:51] you you know what I'm talking
[44:54] about because you've experienced
[44:58] the beauty of
[45:03] Revelation because if you didn't
[45:05] experience the beauty of
[45:08] Revelation then you know the your faces
[45:10] would show different but as I'm looking
[45:13] at you I can see that you know what I'm
[45:17] talking about because this is a
[45:22] reality
[45:24] hallelujah it's life changing
[45:27] in the
[45:30] Lord you know what when when when when
[45:32] when Peter said Thou Art the
[45:35] Christ um Jesus turned around to him and
[45:39] says you are blessed Peter Simon you are
[45:43] blessed but then Verse 18 He says and I
[45:47] say unto thee Thou Art Peter now we know
[45:52] Peter was up and down and in and out in
[45:54] these things right but what are so
[45:56] interesting
[45:57] was that when Peter identified by
[46:01] Revelation who Jesus
[46:04] was Jesus then turned to him and said
[46:08] you are Peter now we know that Peter had
[46:12] their change had to come to Peter at
[46:16] some point Hallelujah but what was so
[46:18] beautiful was that Jesus they could tell
[46:20] Peter who he
[46:23] was and then he goes on you know and and
[46:25] we know these things and and Jesus would
[46:28] say and Upon This Rock I will build my
[46:32] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[46:38] Prevail against it amen and that rock we
[46:44] know is the rock of
[46:50] Revelation brother Brandon would say he
[46:53] says the church is not built upon Jesus
[46:58] he says but it was the
[47:02] revelation of who he
[47:05] is and with
[47:09] Revelation the Gates of
[47:13] Hell cannot Prevail amen can we put up
[47:17] that photo you got it uh brother uh now
[47:22] Satan
[47:24] hates revelation
[47:28] but you and I we love it we want it we
[47:35] say Lord give me
[47:38] Revelation and the more he Reveals His
[47:44] word the more brother AR I
[47:48] want the more he reveals the more I want
[47:54] amen hallelujah you know what I'm
[47:56] discing in in my own personal
[47:59] walk is that the more I am
[48:03] seeing who my God
[48:06] is and the more I am seeing who I am in
[48:11] the
[48:13] word it makes me want to surrender more
[48:20] and more and more of myself to him
[48:24] amen amen the more he reveals
[48:28] with and he starts to show me the things
[48:32] that he's showing me in the
[48:34] scriptures the more I want to just give
[48:39] my life I've given myself to him but I
[48:44] want to
[48:46] give the I just want to give more and
[48:49] more and more of myself to
[48:53] him you see Satan hates
[48:57] Revelation but you and I we love it we
[49:02] want it because Revelation shows you who
[49:08] you
[49:10] are now the devil doesn't want you to
[49:14] know who you
[49:18] are but Revelation comes and reveals to
[49:23] you who you are amen Lord because when
[49:28] the you see the devil
[49:31] knows that when you come to that
[49:35] Revelation and the
[49:37] realization of who you
[49:40] are and I'm just I'm leaving that
[49:42] picture there for a while so you can
[49:44] look at it and you can see yourself in
[49:47] it you see the devil
[49:50] knows that when you come to that
[49:53] recognition
[49:56] he is defeated
[49:59] amen you see brother brandham says Satan
[50:03] hates
[50:04] Revelation you see the Bible this word
[50:07] of God exposes Satan yes so the more we
[50:12] the the word is revealed to us and the
[50:16] more we see God for who he is and the
[50:20] more we see us for who we are we also
[50:23] see the devil for who he is
[50:29] and many times people get afraid of the
[50:36] enemy but you and he's a powerful
[50:40] enemy but the more God Reveals His
[50:46] word we come to a
[50:50] realization that the devil is under our
[50:53] feet amen amen amen yes and that's not
[50:57] just
[50:59] words that's a loving reality
[51:04] amall you see
[51:07] Revelation exposes Satan it Reveals His
[51:12] works and it says the The Works of the
[51:15] of Satan is the attempted
[51:18] destruction of the people of God and
[51:22] trying to make the word of God to no
[51:26] effect yeah to try and tell you that you
[51:30] know what the word of God is not as
[51:33] powerful as people say it is or as the
[51:37] minister says it is so he will the devil
[51:41] will come and he wants to break us down
[51:45] he tried it with brother brandham he
[51:47] didn't come and tell brother brandham
[51:49] that God doesn't exist he tried to tell
[51:52] William brandham that God doesn't care
[51:56] so the devil wants to discredit the word
[52:00] he wants to discredit God but
[52:04] Revelation shows that to us amen so we
[52:08] are
[52:09] able to withand him amen because you see
[52:14] I'm going to read the quote he
[52:17] knows that if the people get the true
[52:23] revelation of the true church
[52:28] and what she
[52:31] is you not just Shak of Tabernacle yeah
[52:35] in this Upper Room yeah but there is
[52:39] something great within
[52:43] you there is some
[52:45] transforming
[52:47] power that's within
[52:50] you and the devil doesn't want you to
[52:53] catch that
[52:55] Revelation because this year it's a
[53:01] revelation he says he knows that to the
[53:04] people get the true revelation of the
[53:07] true church and what she is and what she
[53:10] stands for and that she can do the
[53:15] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[53:22] Army and that is who you are
[53:28] don't let any situation and situations
[53:31] is trying to tell you that you are weak
[53:36] that you are nothing that there is no
[53:39] hope for you don't allow
[53:44] that you have the
[53:47] authority to speak to the devil amen and
[53:52] to tell him to go am
[53:56] ammen I I'm not sure if I gave this
[53:58] testimony I'm going to give it and then
[54:00] we'll go on one one you know there was
[54:03] the devil was to menting me one time for
[54:05] a while and it was just getting to
[54:09] me and uh I I I remember I was in my car
[54:14] and I was driving and I was just getting
[54:16] tired of of just giving in every time
[54:21] the enemy come came my way and I was in
[54:24] the car and I was driving and I was
[54:25] praying
[54:27] and I said Lord I am
[54:29] tired I am tired of
[54:33] fighting that thing it's just getting me
[54:37] down every time and as I'm driving in my
[54:41] car I felt the atmosphere change in my
[54:49] car and I'm praying and I'm praying and
[54:53] then all of a
[54:55] sudden I just found
[54:58] myself just uttering
[55:01] words it was like brother arand is like
[55:04] I was sitting in the passenger seat and
[55:07] I was watching Taz driving his
[55:10] car and I was watching Taz speak stuff
[55:15] yeah that he wasn't planning to speak it
[55:18] was like some I can't explain it it was
[55:21] like just words that came out but it was
[55:24] direct to a specific devil that had been
[55:29] tormenting me but it came out in such
[55:35] Authority huj and then when that was
[55:38] done that's like I I came to
[55:41] myself and and uh I I I was so weak and
[55:46] I I turned around I was close to home I
[55:48] turned around I got home and my wife
[55:50] seen as I came out of the car I was half
[55:53] staggering and she came and said T are
[55:55] you okay what what's wrong and I said
[55:57] wait wait wait wait I'll tell you later
[56:00] but the beauty of it all is that that
[56:04] specific
[56:05] devil never bothered me
[56:09] again until
[56:12] today
[56:14] amen so there is an authority hallelujah
[56:18] amen within
[56:20] you he just wants us to
[56:25] surrender amen surrender everything amen
[56:29] surrender my wants surrender my desires
[56:34] says give it all to Jesus
[56:38] amen and you will
[56:41] see what he
[56:43] does in your
[56:46] life and my life and we know again you
[56:50] know what I'm talking about you going
[56:52] through the same things I'm going
[56:54] through you experiencing the same God
[56:57] that I'm experiencing and you know what
[57:01] I don't ever want to go back to where I
[57:04] came from amen I am grateful for what I
[57:08] have and as I'm reading the word it's
[57:13] showing me what I can
[57:20] attain so I I got this
[57:23] picture and I actually wrote in there I
[57:25] said the word
[57:27] seed in
[57:30] you is
[57:34] Unstoppable you see
[57:36] God has
[57:38] placed a part of
[57:43] himself
[57:45] within
[57:47] you and that part of
[57:51] himself if we go read the scripture if
[57:54] we're going do the message of brother
[57:55] Bram you talk about the gene seed of God
[58:01] you talk about the gene of God you talk
[58:04] about the
[58:05] seed that's what you and I have within
[58:09] us that's right and if we look at this
[58:13] photo this
[58:15] picture it
[58:17] proves the
[58:19] power that is in a natural
[58:24] seat this is a normal
[58:28] flow look at it if I go and I go and
[58:32] pluck it off or plck of that yellow flow
[58:36] I can take it and I can easily just
[58:39] crush
[58:40] it I can go and I can put my foot over
[58:43] it and I can just break that
[58:47] flower but what that flower is proving
[58:51] or this
[58:53] picture is
[58:54] proving that deep down somewhere
[58:59] there is a
[59:02] power Hallelujah brother brandham would
[59:05] talk about
[59:07] transforming power Lord if we look at
[59:11] the natural
[59:13] seed that natural seed has got a power
[59:18] of
[59:21] transformation when it was in the ground
[59:24] it was just a little
[59:29] seed that was laying
[59:33] there and then life came
[59:38] along and started to throw
[59:42] things
[59:44] over the
[59:47] seed
[59:48] trying to stifle its
[59:53] growth trying
[59:56] to keep it down
[1:00:01] there but that
[1:00:04] seed maybe didn't realize
[1:00:08] it but the seed just surrendered
[1:00:14] itself to the life that existed in the
[1:00:18] seed amen
[1:00:22] right and regardless
[1:00:26] of the
[1:00:28] concrete regardless of the
[1:00:32] stuff that
[1:00:35] happened that se
[1:00:40] proved that it had something within
[1:00:44] itself
[1:00:47] Hall that would be
[1:00:49] able to
[1:00:51] press through concrete
[1:00:56] that I think this is called
[1:00:57] concrete or tar or whatever that we have
[1:01:01] to go take a hammer or a axe or whatever
[1:01:05] to make a hole we've got to go and we've
[1:01:07] got to hit it and we got to hit it a
[1:01:11] couple of times in order to make a
[1:01:15] hole the seed
[1:01:17] proved
[1:01:19] regardless of what's at the bottom
[1:01:23] Hallelujah there's an authority
[1:01:26] there's a power of
[1:01:30] transformation and that seed would push
[1:01:35] through the
[1:01:37] obstacles Hallelujah but allowing the
[1:01:40] life that's in that
[1:01:42] seed to do the
[1:01:46] work
[1:01:48] until it has
[1:01:51] transformed into this beautiful flower
[1:01:57] but that
[1:01:58] seed the transformation doesn't stop
[1:02:01] there because the
[1:02:04] transformation goes
[1:02:09] on cuz that flower depending on what it
[1:02:13] is has the potential to become a big
[1:02:19] tree so there is a
[1:02:22] potential within the seed
[1:02:26] natural seed and we see it here now take
[1:02:30] the natural
[1:02:31] seed and look at
[1:02:34] yourself Our
[1:02:37] God has placed within
[1:02:41] you his
[1:02:44] seed and that makes you
[1:02:50] unable
[1:02:53] amen regardless
[1:02:56] of what you might face in life that's
[1:03:01] right the seed within
[1:03:07] you and that seed might be laying
[1:03:10] dormant for a
[1:03:12] while but when the light of the
[1:03:16] word comes your
[1:03:19] way and that
[1:03:21] light
[1:03:23] strikes that seed
[1:03:26] and Revelation eats
[1:03:29] you it changes your
[1:03:35] life a good classical
[1:03:39] example is the woman at the well but the
[1:03:44] brandom would talk about her he to love
[1:03:46] to talk about the woman at the
[1:03:50] well the Bible says in John chapter 4
[1:03:55] where Jesus
[1:03:57] says I have needs to go through
[1:04:04] Samaria so we know Jesus and his
[1:04:06] disciples they were somewhere and they
[1:04:08] were going to go or whatever but Jesus
[1:04:10] just felt this
[1:04:13] pool I have needs to go via
[1:04:20] Samaria because there was
[1:04:23] somebody that needed
[1:04:26] to have that seed that was in her
[1:04:29] brother
[1:04:30] David to have that seed
[1:04:34] ignited she was a
[1:04:38] woman the Bible would would say of ill
[1:04:42] Fame and we know these things right she
[1:04:45] was a woman that people would see as a
[1:04:49] bad woman doing bad
[1:04:53] things but you know what I love about
[1:04:56] God and I see it through the ministry of
[1:04:58] brother
[1:04:59] Brandon is that he would look at that
[1:05:04] woman and you would see
[1:05:07] her as a bad woman she was a bad woman
[1:05:11] doing bad
[1:05:13] things but the grace of God and and and
[1:05:17] the love of God would look at that thing
[1:05:22] from a different
[1:05:24] perspective you know what I believe
[1:05:26] that's what Revelation does to us as
[1:05:28] well the more he reveals himself and the
[1:05:32] more he reveals the word when we look at
[1:05:35] things and when we look at people and
[1:05:38] and maybe this person is not in the
[1:05:40] right space that they need to be in
[1:05:43] because God has revealed more and more
[1:05:47] of himself to us amen our approach and
[1:05:52] our attitude to that person is different
[1:05:55] my Lord so brother Brandon would say for
[1:05:58] about this this lady he says maybe her
[1:06:02] parents did not
[1:06:04] care and maybe she made bad choices in
[1:06:09] life and that's why she ended up where
[1:06:13] she was doing the things that she was
[1:06:17] doing not
[1:06:21] knowing that deep James deep down inside
[1:06:25] of
[1:06:26] her was
[1:06:29] something
[1:06:33] sacred was
[1:06:35] something
[1:06:38] special she would maybe walk down the
[1:06:42] street and the neighbors and the people
[1:06:46] would turn up their
[1:06:48] nose maybe they might gossip about her
[1:06:52] or send messages to the next house and
[1:06:54] say hey close your windows she's coming
[1:07:00] past to the world she was a fthy
[1:07:08] woman but
[1:07:10] Jesus had
[1:07:12] need to go via
[1:07:16] Samaria because this fthy
[1:07:21] woman needed a change in her life
[1:07:26] life amen this fthy
[1:07:31] woman needed an
[1:07:35] experience that to show her who she
[1:07:39] truly
[1:07:43] was so obviously she probably didn't
[1:07:48] know she had that potential within
[1:07:52] her but she probably also knew
[1:07:56] that there was something different about
[1:07:58] her yeah she maybe couldn't put a finger
[1:08:00] on it because if you listen to the
[1:08:03] conversation that she and Jesus
[1:08:06] had it was about
[1:08:09] worship this ill failed ill famed woman
[1:08:13] doing the bad things that she
[1:08:15] does she had a conversation with Jesus
[1:08:20] about
[1:08:22] worship but what she didn't know
[1:08:26] that she as she was coming thinking is
[1:08:31] just another day to come and fetch
[1:08:37] water not knowing that that was her
[1:08:42] day on the calendar of
[1:08:45] God you see God wanted her to be at the
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:52] place at the right time
[1:08:55] in the right season for
[1:08:58] her because there was somebody amen that
[1:09:02] had
[1:09:03] needs Lord to go via
[1:09:07] Samaria she was walking towards that
[1:09:11] well having no
[1:09:14] idea that her life was going to
[1:09:18] change you know what I identify with
[1:09:22] that in my own testimony I went to
[1:09:25] church that day I had no
[1:09:30] idea that my life was going to
[1:09:34] change and I know your testimonies here
[1:09:38] today you had no
[1:09:41] idea that your life was going to be
[1:09:44] changed but he came your
[1:09:47] way he had needs
[1:09:51] Hallelujah to go VI wherever he met you
[1:09:55] yeah forz it was in a valley in South
[1:10:00] Africa in
[1:10:04] Kimberly he had needs to go via Kimberly
[1:10:09] for
[1:10:11] T amen and you have your own testimony
[1:10:15] right when he came your
[1:10:20] way brother bandam says watch what was
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:26] talking about when
[1:10:29] Jesus was talking to this
[1:10:32] woman he says that
[1:10:35] light
[1:10:37] struck that
[1:10:39] seed that was in her she had no idea it
[1:10:43] was there but it was there because you
[1:10:46] see that seed then drives you to want to
[1:10:52] know
[1:10:54] more because that seed knows that this
[1:11:00] word is
[1:11:02] powerful that seed
[1:11:05] knows that there is power in what we
[1:11:12] read so brother Bram says the seed
[1:11:15] talking about the woman it had been
[1:11:18] laying
[1:11:19] there that was spoke by
[1:11:22] God and then when the Holy Holy Spirit
[1:11:26] in
[1:11:27] him moved away her past
[1:11:32] life and showed it to her showed her PA
[1:11:36] that light brother Bram says struck the
[1:11:40] seed yeah that was laying within her she
[1:11:46] had no idea that it was there but it was
[1:11:51] there and when that light stuck struck
[1:11:56] that
[1:11:58] seed she became
[1:12:04] unstable prise Lord cuz what did she do
[1:12:07] she went
[1:12:08] running running and says come and
[1:12:13] see a
[1:12:15] man that told me certain
[1:12:18] things but she did not
[1:12:21] realize it was more than the man just
[1:12:24] telling her things
[1:12:26] something happened within
[1:12:31] her and her life was
[1:12:38] transformed in the patriarch um
[1:12:41] Abraham brother Bram
[1:12:44] says all Abraham seed believes God am
[1:12:50] they are believing God we believe God I
[1:12:55] believe I'm speaking to Abraham's
[1:12:57] spiritual seed today amen he says and we
[1:13:01] know that it pleased God so
[1:13:04] well that here is what he
[1:13:08] said thy
[1:13:11] seed
[1:13:13] shall
[1:13:14] possess the gates of its
[1:13:21] enemy thy
[1:13:23] seed shall possess amen the gates of its
[1:13:30] enemy that is
[1:13:36] scripture and scripture does not
[1:13:40] lie no no what scripture says it will do
[1:13:45] it will
[1:13:48] do amen yes
[1:13:50] sir and I got I got some so I'm not
[1:13:53] going to go to it you can Genesis
[1:13:56] 22:17 Genesis
[1:13:58] 2460 Numbers 14:24 Deuteronomy 18 all
[1:14:03] referring to thy Sheed shall possess the
[1:14:08] Gate of its
[1:14:10] enemy am am that's your
[1:14:15] promise
[1:14:17] Hallelujah so don't let the devil M you
[1:14:20] around amen come on now amen you tell
[1:14:26] him I know who I
[1:14:31] amallah and if you're sitting here today
[1:14:34] right and you're
[1:14:36] struggling with who you
[1:14:38] are you don't have the
[1:14:42] Revelation don't allow yourself to be
[1:14:44] under pressure
[1:14:46] yeah because someone caught a revelation
[1:14:50] of something and maybe you didn't catch
[1:14:53] that revelation
[1:14:55] that doesn't make you any less than that
[1:14:58] person I'm saying that because I've been
[1:15:00] through
[1:15:02] that sitting with brothers and man the
[1:15:04] Deep Revelations and you sit there and
[1:15:06] you feel so insecure and feel like you
[1:15:08] know
[1:15:10] nothing God will in his
[1:15:14] time he will reveal to
[1:15:18] you what you need to know
[1:15:21] amen so don't allow yourself
[1:15:25] to be put under
[1:15:27] pressure no
[1:15:30] don't but just remember
[1:15:32] this that there is something great
[1:15:36] within
[1:15:37] you there's a seed of
[1:15:39] God that's Unstoppable amen I said you
[1:15:44] have a power within you to
[1:15:47] overcome am and my inspiration was Lord
[1:15:51] help us to catch the Revelation amen of
[1:15:55] these
[1:15:56] things because when you come to that
[1:16:00] realization that there is a a an
[1:16:02] authority within
[1:16:05] you nothing can stand in your
[1:16:10] way
[1:16:12] nothing now I know it's easy to say
[1:16:16] that but that's the
[1:16:19] reality amen we might
[1:16:22] think I think brother the Brandon
[1:16:24] there's a quot quote somebody gave a
[1:16:26] yeah I think Andrew G posted a quote and
[1:16:29] I I I screenshot it I want to just read
[1:16:32] it here quickly it says brother brand
[1:16:35] brother brandom actually says he says in
[1:16:38] the in this great warrior David he
[1:16:41] says we still got
[1:16:45] goliaths so there's still goliaths out
[1:16:48] there we know the story of David and
[1:16:51] Goliath right there's still goliaths out
[1:16:54] there
[1:16:56] and those goliaths are trying to
[1:16:58] threaten us and those goliaths are
[1:17:03] trying to still mock us they still
[1:17:06] trying to tell us that we are we are big
[1:17:08] you small you nothing come on but
[1:17:11] brother Bram says we still got goliaths
[1:17:13] amen he says and we still got David's
[1:17:20] too I see The Davids here tonight amen
[1:17:25] all goliaths out there that's right but
[1:17:27] there are Davids here as wellah and what
[1:17:31] did David
[1:17:32] do he followed the instructions of God
[1:17:36] he
[1:17:37] prophesied he didn't have a sword but he
[1:17:41] says I'm going to cut off your
[1:17:44] neck that's right and he did
[1:17:47] that so yeah David's here
[1:17:51] today this is my last quote and then
[1:17:54] we'll finish the musicians can come
[1:17:56] possessing the enemy's
[1:17:59] Gates brother Bram says
[1:18:02] this and
[1:18:05] today the Church of the Living
[1:18:08] God has the
[1:18:10] privilege of standing and seeing the
[1:18:15] Conquering resurrected Jesus
[1:18:18] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:18:21] standing
[1:18:23] present living
[1:18:25] in his
[1:18:28] church he's living with inside of you
[1:18:32] you know that right when you go home
[1:18:36] he's within
[1:18:38] you when you go to bed at night he's not
[1:18:42] only around you but he's in
[1:18:46] you living in his
[1:18:50] church doing the same thing he did there
[1:18:54] then
[1:18:56] yeah then we possess the Gate of every
[1:19:02] enemy yeah we possess
[1:19:07] it not the past possesses it on your
[1:19:13] behalf not the Deacon on your
[1:19:17] behalf but
[1:19:19] you amen doesn't matter how young you
[1:19:23] are on doesn't matter how old you might
[1:19:26] think you
[1:19:28] are you can possess that's right amen
[1:19:33] amen the Gate of every
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:38] enemy if you if you are a Seed of
[1:19:42] Abraham after hearing
[1:19:45] this there's not enough devils in
[1:19:49] hell can keep that Gat before you amen
[1:19:55] now
[1:19:57] sometimes we find
[1:20:00] ourselves
[1:20:03] trapped
[1:20:04] behind some gates oh my
[1:20:10] Lord sometimes it's a bad
[1:20:14] situation and we find ourselves
[1:20:18] trapped behind that
[1:20:22] gate Lord
[1:20:25] and that
[1:20:27] gate is
[1:20:29] trying to prevent
[1:20:32] us from
[1:20:34] moving forward yeah because that's what
[1:20:38] we need to do as
[1:20:41] Christians we move forward amen amen
[1:20:46] Onward Christian
[1:20:49] Soldiers
[1:20:50] Hallelujah so brother brandom says
[1:20:54] there's this
[1:20:55] gate that stands before
[1:20:58] you he says there's not enough devils in
[1:21:02] hell that can keep that gate before you
[1:21:08] Hallelujah now we as we sit
[1:21:12] here can place whatever the gate
[1:21:17] is that's trying to keep us down keep us
[1:21:23] bound
[1:21:25] I wrote here maybe it's a gate trying to
[1:21:31] tell
[1:21:32] you that you cannot receive the Holy
[1:21:37] Ghost cuz the devil does want to try to
[1:21:40] do
[1:21:41] that but you see you have an
[1:21:46] authority to
[1:21:48] possess the Gate of the
[1:21:51] enemy Hallelujah
[1:21:55] brother Bram says that
[1:21:57] gate it has got to
[1:22:01] open yes sir he says I don't care what
[1:22:05] it is yes sir
[1:22:09] Hallelujah now if brother brandom says I
[1:22:13] don't care what it
[1:22:18] is then you must not care what it
[1:22:23] is
[1:22:25] amen because that
[1:22:28] gate can be broken down oh
[1:22:33] yesah believe Lord remember House of
[1:22:36] Hell give way to the name of
[1:22:39] Jesus Amen it might be a gate telling
[1:22:42] you you a weak
[1:22:45] Christian might be a gate telling you
[1:22:48] you just naturally just
[1:22:51] weak trying to tell you that you are
[1:22:56] nothing you have an authority over that
[1:23:05] gate you know what I I love as well
[1:23:08] right is that maybe we we caught in this
[1:23:13] gate uh maybe I don't know what it is
[1:23:15] lust you know all these sorts of things
[1:23:18] that just keeps us
[1:23:21] there and then we think
[1:23:25] because you know I'm caught up in
[1:23:27] this I don't have an
[1:23:29] authority to overcome
[1:23:33] it I don't have I'm not able to really
[1:23:38] break through this
[1:23:40] gate you know Jesus comes he tells us
[1:23:42] about the prodical son oh yes where did
[1:23:46] the prodical son come to
[1:23:49] himself he was in the pig pin
[1:23:54] yes right yeah that's why amongst the
[1:23:58] pigs but he had to come to a
[1:24:02] realization I'm not a
[1:24:05] pig I don't belong in the pig
[1:24:09] pen but he was still that that piggish
[1:24:12] gate was still
[1:24:14] there but he came to the
[1:24:17] realization even behind the gate he came
[1:24:20] to a realization amen hallelujah I'm
[1:24:24] know who I
[1:24:25] am and my father is waiting for me I'm
[1:24:29] not just anything I'm I'm his
[1:24:33] son and that prodal son then had the
[1:24:37] ability to break
[1:24:40] P that
[1:24:42] gate that biggish gate come
[1:24:47] on Hallelujah but before he broke
[1:24:51] through the realization hit him yes yes
[1:24:56] sir so my encouragement to you as we
[1:24:59] close and the musicians you came come
[1:25:02] now brother brandham says there's not
[1:25:06] enough devils in hell that can keep that
[1:25:10] gate before you Hallelujah it will
[1:25:13] open I don't care what it
[1:25:16] is and then he goes on and he says
[1:25:20] this he says you
[1:25:25] walk up
[1:25:26] there as a promised
[1:25:30] seed Seed of Abraham hallu that's who
[1:25:34] you are Hallelujah there's an
[1:25:37] authority within
[1:25:39] you you are able to break whatever gate
[1:25:44] tries to keep you
[1:25:47] down but the brandom says you walk up
[1:25:52] there
[1:25:54] as a promise seat yeah and you say I
[1:26:00] claim this for mine amen amen
[1:26:06] now you could come
[1:26:08] up and you could have brother the T pray
[1:26:11] with you and I would love to do that the
[1:26:15] ministers would love to pray with each
[1:26:18] other we love that we support each other
[1:26:21] amen but brother brandham says yes says
[1:26:25] you have an authority
[1:26:27] right you walk up
[1:26:30] there as a promise seed and you
[1:26:34] say I claim this for mine am amen this
[1:26:41] is
[1:26:43] mine because God swore that he'd raise
[1:26:47] up
[1:26:48] Jesus and through
[1:26:51] Jesus I conquered
[1:26:55] says that's what you say and he says you
[1:26:57] go on he says and you say this I come in
[1:27:02] the name of that conqueror amen Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ amen you have that
[1:27:11] Authority am just put it into practice
[1:27:15] amen you know as as you're looking at me
[1:27:19] your faces beautiful faces it differs
[1:27:22] each of us look different and we each
[1:27:25] have our different challenges in
[1:27:27] life but you have an
[1:27:31] authority over that
[1:27:33] challenge over that Goliath
[1:27:36] amen and and you know what hallelu we
[1:27:39] you pray for something and it seems like
[1:27:42] nothing is
[1:27:44] happening but there are things
[1:27:53] happening I'm I mention it I'm not
[1:27:55] mention it again yet because it sort of
[1:27:56] fits in with the context my my wife was
[1:27:59] sick one time and she was
[1:28:02] um she she she was terribly
[1:28:06] sick and she went into a prayer
[1:28:09] line in in in
[1:28:12] December and she felt the hand of the
[1:28:15] Lord touch her she was supposed to go
[1:28:18] for surgery or major
[1:28:21] operation the Lord touched her in
[1:28:23] December
[1:28:25] it took from December until September
[1:28:29] the next
[1:28:30] year for the manifestation of the
[1:28:33] healing to
[1:28:34] happen but God started the
[1:28:39] work so it doesn't
[1:28:42] matter how long you think you might be
[1:28:46] praying for
[1:28:48] something things are
[1:28:50] happening am my God is coming through
[1:28:55] for you
[1:28:59] amen so you walk up and you say I claim
[1:29:02] this for mine this is mine because God
[1:29:07] swore that he'd raise up Jesus and
[1:29:10] through Jesus I conquer it I come in the
[1:29:14] name of that conqueror Jesus Christ
[1:29:18] Satan or situation or problem step back
[1:29:23] amen so gate whatever it is for the
[1:29:27] prodal son it was a piggish gate but he
[1:29:32] caught the
[1:29:33] revelation of who he was and that
[1:29:37] piggish gate had got to go so he could
[1:29:40] go through and you have that
[1:29:44] Authority uh tell that gate step back
[1:29:48] I'm passing
[1:29:49] through the Bram reads that the

[1:52:48] to God bless you all you're dismissed
