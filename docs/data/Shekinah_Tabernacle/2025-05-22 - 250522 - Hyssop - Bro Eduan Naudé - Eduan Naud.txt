opportunity for me to stand here again i i do not sometimes understand but i'll tell you what um yeah i tell you what when when when when you come into that place where you start preparing or the the lord gives you something and you and you and you start really focusing start really being attentive to what he wants to say and what he wants to um speak to you in that moment he he's speaking the most to me and sometimes i go but lord this is for me why i want to keep it precious right but it's the lord bringing it and say well you need to go and sow you need to be the uh sow the seed and um in those times it's so precious that um the lord comes down put everything into order this is oh yeah i don't know how i get to a order i don't know the ministers can can maybe help me with that i don't know how do you get to a place where you go i think this is i think this is okay thank you musicians thank you so much let's read uh a few scriptures we'll start with a couple i don't know if i'm putting someone on pressure but uh on on the spot but were we not supposed to have a special tonight i don't know was that is it for afterwards oh okay [Music] i thought so okay well i prepared better okay hopefully hopefully it'll come afterwards okay let's see if i can drive hey there we go exodus 12 verse 21 to 24. then moses now this is very very familiar to you this is nothing i i'm absolutely i'm not bringing you anything new anything anything new but um and and some testimonies will come later on that i want to refer to um it is now the time that this needs to be preached i've um i've talked to brother ben and what he's brought over the pulpit as recently as this sunday it is all lining up and i said brother ben they're going to think i'm just just stealing your notes i'm just taking your you know he said no no you claim it you claim it first you you go with it so this thought started when i was supposed to bring a message uh oh when i had covered or when our family was sort of um not be able to come here so within that time i was i was getting these thoughts and then all put it together but yes thank you brother ben that um that you kind in that way let's read then moses called for all the elders of israel and sit unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the and kill the passover and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood and that is in the basin strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood uh upon the lintel and on the two side post the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto the house to smite you and he shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever and then one let's see if i can there we go psalm 51 i've said verse 7 that's just sort of the highlight here but let's read behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and the hidden path that shall make me to known wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean and wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones that what which thou has broken may rejoice and we know about the lamb that was broken you may have your seeds god bless this word that is truly living in this day i was quickly trying to find what is a good definition of awesome it's just a such a powerful song you see the simple songs with the with a with not these big long um explanations or and and those are good as well but you awesome god you awesome he is awesome and i just thought i saw i saw that here extremely impressive or daunting inspiring or as in this awesome power of atomic bomb so we're talking large scale here right sorry this is nothing to do with my sermon extremely well and excellently beautiful brother andy you can preach maybe one day on that and give us the proper termina uh terminology okay hess up his up small little plant and um [Music] and i'll show you that or from from from the previous ones you could see there's a zip on the right and um definitely not impressive definitely not huge definitely nothing to to look upon but it ties in with my idea and my and and what the lord's placed in me in terms of faith it all started actually with the word on the right hand side order now coming from a bit of a background of where we come from in the south africa very proud proud nation and and yes it's a rainbow nation but within that is very uh you have to be proud of where you are from and what you've achieved and all that kind of thing and with that where my sort of family tree and everything comes from from this not not my heavenly family tree praise the lord but this earth one oh maybe i can tell just tell you you probably see i've got glasses on last sunday i i tore one of the one of the contact lenses and that was my last order so if you haven't seen me with glasses this is how i look hey hopefully you won't see me too much for that hey should my beard brother keep it so it just looks more slim so um order order so yeah from a from a uh dutch germanic sort of background forefathers you know before 1650 whatever um there was this was this this order and this regiment and this all and from that angle and from a denominational perspective i found i found i found order good go order in the church it needs to be office there needs to be this they need to be that and everything needs to be in order and to the extreme where sometimes in a certain church i won't mention names it'll be 25 minutes preaching it'll be five minutes talking about tires or offerings that will be um three songs two of them assams and and then three other hymns and then you will be on the hour you will be done and finished and out of there so the reason they had clocks in the church is to see that you don't go over that and now yeah i've come a long way the lord the lord the lord has broken a bit so um and i were talking to brother jeremy um that was briefly here for the funeral and he said that's one of the impressions that there was left with him with brother month our man sorry i'm throwing you under the bus but um this long why is the church why does it take so long and why do you know like i would spend the whole day now here man i was just the whole weekend so anniversary weekend coming up so prepare yourself we're going to have a jubilee throw away all your watches right faith and order hyssop so the idea of god is a god of order um he is he's not he's unchanging just think about the the um universe and what order there needs to be and if you just take in a scale where our little mother earth is is rotating what what will happen if it goes a bit off off sink you know or when when when when we get a bit too heavy or a bit lopsided or we spin too fast or twos too i mean and the scientists can all um sort of delve into that and then explain you in real detail what will happen but god has four in that god has made us in order and that's why we well that's why i can stand here physically that's why i can see the screen so from here i just want to sort of start to explain the idea and this is also again multiple times done can we can we can we try and step into um into the time where moses and and and and he called all the elders right so here comes all the all the elderly gentlemen i i assume and tell them this is this this is what the lords tell me told me you need to go out and do this tell your families tell do not do and and and giving this this order right and would you not think there was someone standing there maybe one of the kids or whatever and dad comes in and he says okay we need hyssop we need lamb we'll sort it all out you know like the in an idea house we would do a bit of delegating so you do this you do that and you so and you and you scatter you go okay you get the hyssop we'll grab a lamb on the way you sharpen the knife we get everything ready we've got to be ready before midnight right before so there goes one of the one of the children let's take children if it's for example and he runs off and he grabs the first bush that he can find get a bunch of it dad's going to be so impressed they that's going to be so impressive big bunch of big brushes and everything of of um i don't know what was the end her toy origami or something like that you know um lavender lavender was quite a popular thing so grabbing that oh it smells so beautiful looks so good dad's gonna be so impressed i'm getting this big bunch of that and put that there yes i've got time to spare they're not even back with the lamb yet so you know all good here comes dad see okay so i took a bit longer than usual and i come in and open the door and as a oh it's lavender why is it lavender why is lavender did did moses not say um what did he say hyssop it was hyssop yes um who brought her who brought the lavender why is the lavender we need to go we need to get hyssop we need to apply we apply the blood with hyssop okay a simple thing like that so do you not think that people israel the the the physical israel the jew was was running around and grabbing all the hyssop do you think there was any hyssop left it was hyssop that was in the order you do not apply anything else now i'll come to why i'm saying that and and and yes god is a god of order and from the smallest to the biggest thing he's placed in order and he's and has given us instruction so that we can follow just imagine while you there that where they came now this is one of the last plagues well this is the last plague sorry and when they get to this point jew gentile have seen destruction have seen thus saith the lord in action have seen all these um absolute tumultuous times with with you know crops being destroyed and and everything sort of taken away you would think that god means business he's he's not here to to play around he's not here to to to to be satisfied with just picking up a stick and applying some blood maybe just on the top lentil maybe just on the two posts and then forget about and walk in that that there was a structure there was an order there was a lord and the lord said do this there was no if but some babies right so we've seen that line that coming up from there and saying here's the now you apply the blood and this is how you apply the blood i'll jump quickly to one kings now this um he's talking here about about um solomon and oh man it's it's so wonderful that the some of the sermons i'm listening to the one in particular today um was talking about all about solomon and it was interesting because i only found this today and i thought i have to i have to throw it in and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and a fowl and of creeping things and of fishes so something as significant as the um as the cedar tree so so the cedar trees were were quite impressive impressive in those days and and and um i will quickly maybe jump to there the cedaw of liminen um the cedar of lemon and like a one and only tree now this is something i found just online that that sort of ties everything also from a scripture uh scripture a spiritual sense um one and only tree in scripture grows up so one and only in terms of a very unique one a one that's that's sort of standing um amongst the other trees out you know grows upright majestic and distinct and stature resilient and enduring as lumber for construction and temples and palaces these cedars flourished in a one-of-a-kind location the cooler mountain heights of lebanon to the north of the land promised to abraham's sea uh descendants so he's here he he he's referring to to to the cedar of lebanon something that is that is magnificent that is big it is 100 feet tall um you know and then in the same breath and in the same sentence referring to hyssop something insignificant something small something doesn't grow crow bigger than a meter you know it's a shrub it's not even a bush i was thinking you know maybe it was hessop that was the burning bush but then i thought bush is bigger than a shrub it's beginner you know a herb so um i thought okay no let's leave that i'm not gonna not gonna play around with what was it potentially and what was burning yes so now there was a set vessel full of vinegar and they filled the sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth the application of this hessep and where it was used to thinking now of the cedar of lebanon is here's the cedar for me here's the one tree here's the tree of life here's our tree v tree and hyssop is being applied or used to apply something something insignificant right it was most probably growing from amongst you know on golf how do you pronounce i say golfer um it was probably growing sort of everywhere in the crevices and in the walls so that's why i've put up these pictures of words growing in the in the crevices in the in the walls it's quite a it's quite a let me let me let me show you so from the the city of lebanon plummeting down to hyssop see the treetops soaring near you hundred feet tall descend to the humble herb spilled out across the hot arid common grounds of the holy land sprawling at a lowly 18 inches or so a herb from the mint family there's a lot of um a lot of research trying to being done and and controversy about about whether it was part of this mint was it part of the oregano was it part of um you know what hyssop family or family from the hyssop was used but i won't go into that i've got something here called is off so i'll go into that now a herb from the mint family hessop is a hardy plant that grows without complaint and the most challenging of circumstances intense all day sun with little water herbs have a forgiving culture growing back easily when branches have been broken or removed and no fussiness for fertilizer this modest plant is mentioned in self-depleting sinful and brushed with death moments across scripture it was waved over door frames for the angel of death to pass over israel households and used to cleanse those struck by skin diseases and it does go on so there's my cedar and there he's being applied he's he's he's receiving hyssop hyssop has touched his tongue has touched his lips right the application of faith this application now i want to tie this hessip to faith our beloved prophet speaks of a about hisp and tying it to faith now i want to bring in that picture of where we've we've had we've had uh exodus being applied that is that is yes the god is a god of order but if you take that hyssop and you apply that what are you left with you walking into your house and you sitting there and you probably hear the death angel coming over feeling it death is not a good thing death is not a a thing that is sat subtle and they are sitting in there and the only thing they have is what the lord said i applied this lord this is according to your word for now for this season and due season i've done what you've asked me through a prophet i've applied now i'm sitting and what am i doing am i am i am i in doubt so now faith comes now the believer comes out now he's saying there was probably people that were sitting and dancing and praising the lord for they've seen all these miracles they've received this word from the prophet they've done what they should do and now they're rejoicing because they've received that faith already but there's people inside there saying lord the only thing i have left now is faith the only thing i have now is faith is believing that what you've done for the descendants from the children when you've kicked them out of edom from there to now you've shown us time and time again where you come and you rescue us here please lord come and rescue us again the only thing that was sitting inside there was um was faith and what i wanted to throw in here is faith is faith is punctual faith is is never too late now i tie faith to the lord jesus christ right it's it's not it's not a separate thing that i'm saying here but it's punctual because it has a appointment yes faith's divine appointment is perfectly in season when it's met with action right now all of a sudden faith runs when it when it leaves your mouth you we i need to hear sorry about that i need to hear you i need the lord is saying speak let it happen let faith run let it leave the mouth and let it that it that it can find its divine appointment the woman touching the hymn of jesus's garment pushing through the crowd but faith has a divine appointment it was not made easy for her pushing through those crowds so if you can't imagine and praise the lord i've been having this wonderful time where i can place myself in a time in the scripture and i can see what's happening around me and all of a sudden i'm seeing this woman pushing through this crowd this was not 20 30 people we're talking about a crowd and she's pushing against this she's she's she's she faith has got a divine appointment i just need to get to that hem of that garment i just need to touch any part of him just to what then everything stops and i see it in myself as there was a stop there was a pause there was a silence and the crowd got quiet why is this man stopping what has happened what has changed what was different from a few steps ago to now he says virtue has left me who has touched me what do you mean who's touched you look around you you've got a crowd of people following you but one had a divine appointment i'll quickly give two testimonies and then we can move on to that wonderful piece in the scripture uh and um in one of the our messages and that's um a small thing so i want to i want to let you understand that faith is faith is not is not in any way connected to size now when i say that um we can pray for rain from one sense this is big from one sense this is small we can pray that i foun and and brother honestly said it lord i need a new car right something that could be insignificant to one is big and significant to the other so faith is not connected to what is being asked right lundy so we we had these little storms i think it was a week or two weeks ago we had the storms coming through jumped in the car and it's exactly at that time that everyone need to be dropped at school and all that and it's pouring down it's bucketing down and landing goes citizen cars and say oh lord just gives us that little gap just to drop the kids to run and to get out and just you know so that i i'm not soaking wet now if she was soaking wet nothing would have happened she would not have melted but she was saying just lord just give me that grace and i'm not saying it stopped and it was dry and the ground you know all of a sudden was you know where i was walking was dry but there was a significant change in difference in the climate so as soon as she left the car and i was driving around the block because now we're in a storm and i'm saying okay i'll circle the block twice when you come out you phone me we do this whole little routine and i'll fit you and you jump in the car so you don't get too much weight you know to wait and she strolled and she strolled out get in the car started pouring and rain again we go but lord i can't forget you in these moments i can't say that's not you lord oh my so that was there was that was really and that makes you happy you know you can sit and you can cry sometimes because because faith had that divine appointment but sometimes you just you feel sprightly and alive and you just wanna you know sort of leave this earth with joy uh because of small little moments like that but the lord can trust us then in the small moments he can trust us then in the big moments he will give that to us the big moment so the next example also quite recent in the last week my my sister previously contacted me with one of the kids that's either in their school or one of the family friends that's that's gone through a bit of a muscle um problem so some of the people that's here ck levels i i'm not too sure from a scientific level what that means but the ck levels in the body was very very very high and um the doctors were quite concerned about this this logan is his name and what happened is so now this is lead up so see the doctors there's a six weekly cycle and every four weeks they need to do this and this and that and um and the doctors were getting a bit more concerned so what happened is i i assume uh my sister then asked my dad can can we pray for her and um now and this this shows you that the lord you can you can tie this to the scripture to to this message tonight in terms of the god as a god of order it had to happen that my dad probably wasn't that comfortable with giving a prayer in english sorry dad if you're watching um so he asked me he said can i can i just make do a little prayer do a little prayer in english and i can send it to these and these uh you know english people so i said yeah sure and i started typing a message right at the end when i sent it i go oh i actually just could have left a voice note you know and i said what do you prefer do you want to send like a text do you want to he said no no no the voice note will be fine so next morning i sort of i had the prayer that i typed open and i thought okay i'll pray that but you know i'll just i'll just pray as i want to pray i sat and knelt at the bed and prayed and um and i and i and i sent the voice note so now you know um and actually i sent the miracle working god one of one of these recordings to them and um one of the church recordings so so um sent that and they were very happy lucinda my sister was very happy and very grateful and it was received and and the message came back from the parents saying they they were so happy they were so um filled with joy to to have people that they don't know from a borrow soap and that will they will enter in and pray and and and give this um sort of honor and glory to god and and asking where the faith has got a divine appointment so what happened is um uh the long and short is logan was meant to go for another checkup uh monday so monday south african time and um if the ck levels didn't drop enough then you know they would have had to do a muscular biopsy i think it's called so quite a significant thing i actually don't know how old logan is but from what i understand he's not that old and um and was it was it because i could climb into that burden and see but lord i see young healthy children of my own and i do not want any child to go through trauma and and and a limitation in the body to to be active and jump around and was it that or was it that divine appointment of that all of our faith the family's faith pulled together to to to bring testimony and what i've what i've recently also discovered um actually that was revealed to me is ask ask a reason why why somebody needs to be healed why somebody needs a car why somebody needs a restoration in their in their soul or coming back to the lord why is it i want to be healed lord so that i'm not sick anymore or is it can i go and give a testimony when you come on the scene and that the devoid appointment is met and it's completed can i go and praise your name and and and and ask that you come into my life because of this you know is the is there is a significant reason why you asking um for faith to run so logan came back or sorry the message uh message came back and maybe i could just quickly read that if you don't mind um this morning my heart overflows with thanks thankfulness so this was yesterday our time god is good all the time i see his miracle in my little logan and i don't know how to thank him enough we finally got logan's results now previously um the ck levels was i think between four and five thousand so i don't know what's the what's those levels logan's results and logan ck levels come back to 310 over the next week or two it should be fully back to normal along with the enzymes that's a bit high in his liver all glory to god this has been such a difficult two weeks and she carries on now yeah i mean i'm not a guy for numbers or science or anything that just sounds that there was a significant change within a couple of feet within a couple of steps there was virtue left me who was touching the hem of the garment and i can sit on this side twelve thousand kilometers away and say who touched that hem of that garment amen lord's everywhere and you know what the squeeze that's coming from the left and right onto us and we're squeezing upwards that means we can look over all these little walls of denomination and all these little things that's been erect and we can say we will pray for you regardless we will love you regardless and we will cross all these boundaries into that heavenly vision and that liberty that we will have of praying in faith the token oh i think it's a great lesson for us now this has also come it was good timing because i was preparing this and that was one of the first thing i i threw into my into my notes and then i think it was sister vanessa or someone that shared it with you know with lundy or something like that i thought yeah no i was i was literally still on the page when all this this this happened so i thought well thank you lord seeing the believing worship as he was identified by the token of blood he had to the believer had to get the lamb slay the lamb a lamb for a house take the lamb at the blood the hyssop which was just a little brush that grows up there in the country common weeds we call it and how to apply the blood it shows by the applying of the blood with his hyssop hyssop represents faith many times people think they have to have some supernatural faith to be a believer it isn't the fight the hessop speaks for that just common with like you could get it anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood and apply the blood i just want to quickly go back and show you that's hyssop it's it's not big it is not significant but it is in order and it represents for us it represents faith um the blood tonight is applied by simple faith just not nothing supernatural is just around you everywhere just simply like a child reach out and get a hold of it and apply the blood the hyssop is just a simple childlike faithful to believe it isn't something out of your reach not out of your reach as a ten eight five year old not out of your reach as a 65 year old a hyssop you don't have to reach very far to get at this heist that grows in this in that country it grows out of the cracks of the walls out of the cleft of the rock was my thoughts that i thought there kind of a diamond shaped leaf you can pick it up anywhere just as grass or weeds would be and in the country here now just pick it up and apply it that's the way faith is to be applied take faith rather and apply the blood of jesus christ by faith to the heart's door this was going to separate and make the difference between those who were going out of egypt and those who were going to stay in egypt and perish with egypt it made the difference strange how god you always works through science signals tokens and so forth and i would say order as well he always has done it because he hasn't changed that's his way of doing anything he never does it outside of that god never makes a move until he does it that way the way the the the way god starts that's the way god finishes he's infinite in ineptant omnipresent omniscient he needs nobody's help he doesn't need our interpretation praise the lord for that praise the lord for that and i just want to and i just want to quickly change the little angle from where what we read here from faith and that little hyssop that's insignificant that's something that's got so much power when it's when it's in order when it's stepped into that position when it's it it it's it's it's it's where it needs to be it's waiting for the divine appointment changing the dynamics slightly to look at the individual and i want to talk to you what do you think what about you you if you think that you are insignificant in the greater economy of god well praise the lord because watch out because that will be halfway down the road for you to becoming part of god's order god's economy if you think you're insignificant well you've got something coming amen and i want to yeah i want to leave you with something that faith hyssop and love love how love ties how how can you not love um the lord of uh of of isaac and jacob and abraham lord if you've seen all these things happen how can you not love him and something that struck me very recent it is not a new song in any matter but this is this is the bridge of the song and i'll read it for you this is a a divine appointment from almighty god with you this is what i saw here there's no shadow you won't light up there's no mountain you won't climb up coming after me there's no wall you can't kick down lie you won't tear down coming after me there's no shadow you won't light up and mountain you won't climb it and start singing there's no wall you won't kick down and lie you won't tear down as the musicians come there's no wall you want he he you lord won't kick down and lie down coming after me that is a divine appointment that the lord's got with each one of you if you have that little small insignificant faith and that faith leaves your mouth and that faith's got a divine appointment you better watch out something will change we cannot it cannot not happen in the greater economy of god thank you lord for this can we close our eyes lord jesus what a wonderful victorious time that we live in lord what a time that that you've
