[28:34] oh
[29:24] good morning everybody um just a quick
[29:26] background on on
[29:28] the reason that they're singing the song
[29:30] today um we've done a few um
[29:34] sunday school lessons on david and
[29:36] goliath and
[29:37] today i was going in a certain direction
[29:42] and so
[29:43] um over the past few weeks i've given
[29:44] them a memory verse
[29:46] and i
[29:47] i spot called on av for his memory verse
[29:51] and it was supposed to have been one
[29:53] samuel
[29:54] 1745 is actually the memory verse but he
[29:58] started
[29:59] reciting a verse that i was gonna
[30:02] actually the lesson was actually based
[30:04] on
[30:05] and so i asked him why and he said
[30:08] jonah gave him that verse which was the
[30:11] incorrect memory verse anyway but it was
[30:14] actually spot on on where i was going
[30:17] because i
[30:18] my verse today was on samuel 1 17
[30:23] 1 samuel 17 47 which says
[30:28] and all this assembly shall know that
[30:30] the lords save it not with sword and
[30:33] spear for the battle is the lord's and
[30:35] he will give you
[30:37] into our hands
[30:39] okay so i was um the lesson today was
[30:43] the battle is the lord's
[30:45] and also i wanted to show them where the
[30:48] testimony of where that song actually
[30:50] came from and why brother ryan hayes
[30:53] actually how the lord gave him that song
[30:56] um so this is this is the reason why
[30:59] they're singing the song today
[31:05] [Music]
[31:11] is
[31:16] [Music]
[31:44] we desire

[49:26] brother ben asked me last night to bring
[49:27] a word and i was just
[49:29] thinking about different things that i
[49:30] could potentially speak about and there
[49:32] wasn't a lot a lot coming
[49:34] um
[49:36] look to even even look at some old
[49:38] material maybe thought i'd pull some of
[49:39] that out but
[49:40] um
[49:42] then then i thought uh maybe i'll
[49:45] you know you get these thoughts i
[49:46] thought maybe i'll read hebrews and i
[49:48] thought i'd redone
[49:49] hebrews let's go i was quite tired i
[49:51] said let's go hebrews 15.
[49:59] so and i think i see oh man there is no
[50:01] hebrews 15. so cool man i'm
[50:04] i'm in an awful place here
[50:05] [Laughter]
[50:07] and i thought to myself this is
[50:08] interesting i'm trying to find an answer
[50:11] what i was looking for was an answer
[50:13] and i thought that's an interesting
[50:14] thing to talk about trying to find an
[50:16] answer
[50:17] you know i needed an answer from the
[50:18] lord lord what shall i speak about and i
[50:20] needed an answer and my answer was i'll
[50:23] speak about needing an answer
[50:26] because
[50:28] who we as human beings we always need
[50:30] answers right yes that's
[50:33] that's that's how we we operate because
[50:35] we because we travel
[50:37] through time and we're always forced to
[50:40] make decisions we always need answers
[50:42] we're always
[50:43] we need answers each day don't we really
[50:45] about things that that's that's the way
[50:47] that we are
[50:50] spiritually speaking
[50:52] the bride we actually live in a time of
[50:54] answers
[50:56] that's right more answers than i think
[50:57] anyone has ever come across we have more
[51:00] answers than anybody else on this earth
[51:02] has ever had that's right
[51:04] we have now this is now by faith we have
[51:06] it we don't have it unless we claim it
[51:08] but by faith we have more answers
[51:10] because the opportunity to get more
[51:12] answers is laying before us
[51:15] and by the same token
[51:18] the world is in a
[51:19] a state of confusion
[51:22] confusion generally means either no
[51:24] answers or the wrong answers that's
[51:26] right that's confusion
[51:28] um
[51:29] and
[51:30] spiritually speaking we we know why that
[51:33] is this is the this is the age of the
[51:34] pale horse which is all three mixed
[51:35] together it's just confusion
[51:37] and
[51:38] and
[51:39] the time of
[51:41] babylon
[51:42] this is the tower of babel which was in
[51:43] babylon and this was where the confusion
[51:46] started
[51:47] because they were all in one accord
[51:49] they could speak the same language they
[51:51] were building this great tower and it
[51:52] was going to reach up to heaven i
[51:53] believe they called this area the gates
[51:55] of heaven brother brennan was saying
[51:57] but he god didn't like what they were
[51:59] doing so he he
[52:02] changed all the languages and then it
[52:03] became a place of confusion
[52:05] and
[52:06] this is this is
[52:08] i guess you call this the epicenter of
[52:10] confusion
[52:11] right there people were so confused
[52:13] what's going on and they couldn't now
[52:14] talk to each other it was just one big
[52:16] melting pot of confusion and that's what
[52:18] babylon is today it's confusion so
[52:21] so what the seed was here in genesis is
[52:24] what we're finding out now is in this
[52:26] place where babylon once again is has
[52:28] taken control
[52:30] through the catholic church and just
[52:31] through through the work of satan we've
[52:33] just got this place of confusion that's
[52:35] the just want to lay these few these few
[52:37] um
[52:40] foundations here but this doesn't
[52:42] surprise you you you watch
[52:44] some news you look around you and you
[52:46] can sense there's confusion going on
[52:48] there's
[52:48] there's people confused yeah there's a
[52:51] lot of confusion
[52:52] people not understanding
[52:54] much about the the true essence of life
[52:57] yes i want to read a quote from brother
[52:59] brandon he said
[53:00] this is brother branham and third person
[53:03] referring to himself that people were
[53:04] saying to him when he's in a prayer line
[53:05] he said brother branham i truly i truly
[53:07] realize that we're living in the last
[53:09] days i see the people in the spirit in
[53:10] the last days
[53:12] i see where they're having a form of
[53:13] godliness and ungodly people think
[53:15] they're right giving heed to seducing
[53:17] spirits and doctrines of devils i want
[53:19] to receive the holy ghost brother
[53:20] branham i've never been born again
[53:23] though i belong to a fundamental church
[53:25] or so forth but as far as being born
[53:27] again i haven't received it but now i
[53:29] want to accept christ right now and be
[53:30] filled with the holy ghost would you
[53:31] raise your hand
[53:35] god bless you right in the midst of all
[53:37] this devil's confusion and everything
[53:39] else
[53:40] hundreds of hands are going up to
[53:42] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:45] right in the midst of confusion
[53:47] young men young women some of them
[53:49] sitting wiping their eyes with tears
[53:50] right in the midst of confusion
[53:53] yet there's nothing confused
[53:54] there's nothing confused about the
[53:56] presence of god amen
[53:58] and when god's power is moving into the
[53:59] hearts of the people
[54:01] so that's the place where we find no
[54:03] confusion as in the spirit of god and in
[54:05] his word
[54:06] there's no confusion and we
[54:08] i i want to
[54:10] speak a message to the lord
[54:12] from to you all this morning saying that
[54:15] the lord jesus wants to give you all the
[54:16] answers that you need
[54:17] that's my message to you this morning
[54:20] and i feel that's from the lord to each
[54:22] one of you it's a time where the lord
[54:23] jesus wants to give you the answers if
[54:25] you're confused about something the lord
[54:26] wants to give you the answers
[54:28] he wants to give you the answer and he
[54:29] knows the exact right answer he is going
[54:30] to give you the answers that's what his
[54:32] desire is for all of you
[54:34] that's his true heart towards every one
[54:36] of you so if you get nothing else out of
[54:37] the service remember
[54:39] i believe that's from the lord he wants
[54:40] you to have all the answers that you
[54:42] need
[54:43] sometimes we don't get all the we don't
[54:45] get the full answer but he gives us the
[54:46] answers that we need yes that's right
[54:48] when he was here on earth he would speak
[54:50] and he would explain scriptures like the
[54:52] parable of the sower
[54:54] and then people not a lot of people
[54:56] understood why he would say that why are
[54:58] you just talking about gardening you
[54:59] know i thought you're supposed to be
[55:00] preaching the gospel when we you know
[55:01] i'm a fisherman i don't really need to
[55:02] know about gardening because that's
[55:03] essentially what he talks about how to
[55:05] grow seeds and what happens when you
[55:06] grow seeds but then when he was with his
[55:08] disciples afterwards it says he
[55:10] expounded unto them what he was talking
[55:11] about here is actually the answer to
[55:13] what i was talking about here's a you're
[55:15] a bit confused i'll give you these this
[55:17] word and you won't be confused anymore
[55:19] and you are all disciples of the lord
[55:21] you're all walking with him you're in
[55:22] union with him
[55:23] so he wants to give you the answers to
[55:25] anything you're confused about he can
[55:26] pull you aside and he'll say here's the
[55:27] answers
[55:29] all of you
[55:31] i don't want to dwell on this too long
[55:32] this sort of stuff because i don't need
[55:34] to point out that we live in a confused
[55:35] world but just to
[55:37] confirm that we do
[55:39] i could have got a i could have got 10
[55:41] sermons on the confusion that's out
[55:42] there but we don't want to look on the
[55:44] negative
[55:45] fake
[55:46] we want to look on the real thing and
[55:47] then we can just easily identify the
[55:49] fake you know that's how they teach
[55:50] people to identify fake things as they
[55:53] teach them what the real thing looks
[55:54] like
[55:55] and then they spot a fake you don't tell
[55:56] them all about the fake stuff this is
[55:57] the fact that this is the fact that this
[55:59] is the fact that
[56:01] because i don't really know what the
[56:01] real thing looks like you know some
[56:03] ministries like that they're pointing at
[56:04] everything else everyone's doing wrong
[56:05] they but they don't have the real thing
[56:06] to actually give
[56:08] a lot of the a lot of the people that
[56:10] are anti this message that's all they've
[56:11] got and they do it with us with everyone
[56:13] they just point out all the wrongs but
[56:15] they have nothing to they have no right
[56:17] to bring people to
[56:18] okay you say so what what is right then
[56:20] where do i go uh we're not sure about
[56:22] that we just want to tell you where not
[56:23] to go yes well that's what i thought you
[56:24] just want to try and tell us what all
[56:25] the fakes are
[56:27] but you're not sure it's a fake because
[56:28] you haven't seen the real thing you know
[56:30] so we want to look upon the real word of
[56:32] god and then identify what what doesn't
[56:34] make sense
[56:35] does this make sense to you there are no
[56:37] wrong right or wrong answers there is
[56:39] only intuition
[56:42] now this is very confusing because this
[56:44] is now non-christian
[56:45] you know just
[56:47] ideas that just sort of
[56:48] float in and someone grabs hold of it
[56:50] and oh yes i think i think that but this
[56:52] is
[56:53] i would call this a silly
[56:56] thought
[56:59] oh my goodness only intuition
[57:01] so what if i say to tom you know now we
[57:03] can say this because he's public he's a
[57:05] public figure and he's
[57:06] spoken it so it's it's it's when
[57:08] something's in the public arena they
[57:10] expect you can talk about them but if it
[57:11] wasn't i wouldn't
[57:13] say okay tom
[57:15] let's try this little experiment let's
[57:16] maybe put you in a little room
[57:19] and
[57:20] let's put a let's put some bombs in
[57:22] there right in this room and let's run a
[57:23] wire back to another room and let's put
[57:25] a bunch of three or four year olds in
[57:26] there
[57:27] and and there's a button there saying
[57:29] blow up tomorrow don't blow up tom
[57:31] and now you sit in there let's get these
[57:33] little children use your intuition how
[57:35] do you feel about those children
[57:38] maybe girls might go oh no don't block
[57:39] tom and there'd be a smelly guy you blow
[57:41] up tom
[57:42] you know because his intuition told him
[57:46] but you see
[57:48] so tom there's more than intuition
[57:49] there's right or wrong we shouldn't blow
[57:51] you up so we got to teach people don't
[57:53] blow up tom
[57:54] you know
[57:56] there has to be right or wrong otherwise
[57:57] we can't function
[58:02] i i laugh at this but this is very
[58:04] demonic this is this the stuff that's
[58:06] happening is you know sometimes with the
[58:08] stuff you either laugh or cry you think
[58:10] man i
[58:11] i'm going to get very angry i just can
[58:12] laugh it off but i'm not laughing like
[58:14] i'm not making life of it like i think
[58:15] it's not important
[58:18] this was a hearing about
[58:21] the new
[58:23] i guess in the states that the
[58:26] they sort of changed how abortion was
[58:28] done and they said that each state can
[58:29] now decide it not not it just went from
[58:31] a
[58:32] national
[58:33] level to a state level
[58:35] there's a lot of uproar about it because
[58:36] people in certain states if they didn't
[58:38] want it then they would
[58:39] decide what they wanted to do in their
[58:40] state but if you wanted it you could
[58:42] just go to another state so
[58:44] um
[58:46] but this this one here was
[58:48] this this lady is a professor at
[58:50] berkeley and the other guys as a senator
[58:53] and she started referring to people with
[58:55] the capacity for pregnancy
[58:58] and
[59:00] he said to her um
[59:02] excuse me
[59:03] do you mean woman
[59:06] and she said i i find your comments very
[59:08] transphobic yes i just want to say that
[59:11] right and he said and she said um
[59:15] she said do you believe men can have
[59:17] babies
[59:18] and he said uh no
[59:21] and he she said that shows you're
[59:23] transphobic
[59:26] now how do you get to that position
[59:28] is you think okay a person that's a
[59:30] woman if they say they're a man they're
[59:32] now a man
[59:34] but then they have the capacity to have
[59:35] a baby so so a man can have a baby
[59:38] so so that's her that's her
[59:41] logic behind this argument right
[59:43] so now he's transphobic because he's
[59:46] saying you're not accepting that comment
[59:48] is not accepting trans people so you're
[59:50] you're doing violence towards them
[59:52] he's like so we can't even have this
[59:54] conversation without you you accuse me
[59:56] of all these things and saying woman
[59:57] can't have babies but you see
[59:59] why engage in this nonsense because it's
[1:00:02] confusion
[1:00:03] it's just
[1:00:04] now
[1:00:06] but it's demonic the the the answers
[1:00:09] that she came to were not answers from
[1:00:12] the lord that the lord gave her
[1:00:14] they were answers from a demon yes from
[1:00:16] the pit of hell is where the answer came
[1:00:18] from that she grabbed onto and agreed to
[1:00:21] yes that's right see
[1:00:23] now when we talk about answers we want
[1:00:24] godly answers we want god's answers lord
[1:00:26] what's your answer because i don't want
[1:00:28] these i don't want to listen to these
[1:00:30] demonic answers and these answers are
[1:00:32] all around us these demonic answers
[1:00:34] some of them we pick easily some of them
[1:00:36] are a bit more subtle
[1:00:38] but that's why the lord says you shall
[1:00:40] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:00:42] you free
[1:00:43] now you all know my
[1:00:45] uh concept on freedom is you can't just
[1:00:48] say i'm free
[1:00:50] because freedom has to be related to
[1:00:52] something it has to be free from
[1:00:54] something it's got to be relative i
[1:00:55] can't say i'm free because people like
[1:00:58] to say well i'm free in christ that
[1:00:59] means i can do anything i want it's not
[1:01:01] it's not the correct concept of freedom
[1:01:04] free when the lord says you'll know the
[1:01:06] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:01:07] it's essentially
[1:01:09] you'll be free from the wrong answers
[1:01:11] from the wrong stuff and the
[1:01:12] consequences of the wrong answers that's
[1:01:13] what you'll be free from
[1:01:15] if i don't set you free and tell you the
[1:01:17] right way you'll be you'll go down the
[1:01:19] way of sin you won't accept salvation
[1:01:20] then you'll pay the price for that and
[1:01:22] that will be the road so that's the
[1:01:24] that's where i'm going to set you free
[1:01:25] from that road it doesn't mean when you
[1:01:27] come to christ you do whatever you want
[1:01:28] because paul said paul a prisoner of
[1:01:30] jesus christ
[1:01:31] see he was because he decided that paul
[1:01:34] decided i want your answers
[1:01:37] not those answers so if your answers say
[1:01:39] this then i'm constrained i'm bound by
[1:01:41] your answer so so it's it's
[1:01:44] when we say freedom
[1:01:46] it means more i'm free in christ it
[1:01:47] means i'm free from all that stuff
[1:01:50] like i'm free from the trickery i'm free
[1:01:52] from the devils
[1:01:54] and all these demons the ideas and their
[1:01:57] ways to try and drag me that way because
[1:02:00] we must understand on this basis that
[1:02:01] every that the lord's answers for us
[1:02:04] only have our intention i only have our
[1:02:06] good intention in mind
[1:02:08] all of his answers are only good for us
[1:02:10] none of his answers
[1:02:12] there's no trickery in it that that the
[1:02:13] end result of one of his answers is
[1:02:15] negative for us it's all good
[1:02:16] even if we don't understand it it's
[1:02:18] always good but behind every every
[1:02:20] answer of satan is trickery that's right
[1:02:22] like a salesperson that's trying to sell
[1:02:24] you
[1:02:24] rubbish and he knows it's rubbish but
[1:02:26] he's trying to trick you to buy it
[1:02:28] but he knows it's rubbish satan knows
[1:02:31] overall his product he's trying to sell
[1:02:32] you it's rubbish he knows it he he knows
[1:02:37] he's giving you a real deal he just
[1:02:38] tries to trick you and all his demons
[1:02:40] are there to try and trick us so the
[1:02:42] lord says i want to make you free from
[1:02:43] that
[1:02:44] and be and be alive to christ
[1:02:47] okay and now this this is very simple
[1:02:49] but there's actually two types of
[1:02:50] answers because there's a lot of answers
[1:02:52] given you google something you get a lot
[1:02:53] of answers
[1:02:55] but there are two types of answers what
[1:02:56] are they
[1:02:59] right answering the wrong answer
[1:03:01] like
[1:03:02] if i tell if i ask you can a man have a
[1:03:04] baby
[1:03:05] what do you say
[1:03:07] that's the right answer see
[1:03:09] you're
[1:03:11] you're a lot smarter bro than a berkeley
[1:03:12] professor
[1:03:14] a very intelligent boy this
[1:03:17] whoa
[1:03:19] no we did it by the word of god because
[1:03:20] the word of god is correct
[1:03:23] his answer is right we don't need to
[1:03:25] worry about it it's just right
[1:03:27] okay there are right answers there are
[1:03:29] wrong answers
[1:03:31] and i briefly touched on this at the
[1:03:33] beginning but
[1:03:34] we need answers because we're moving
[1:03:37] like we need answers every day what we
[1:03:38] should do yeah
[1:03:40] like
[1:03:41] i want to boil it right now make it real
[1:03:43] simple we could wake up in the morning i
[1:03:44] have to decide whether we want to live
[1:03:45] or not i have to make a decision do i
[1:03:47] really want to live this day you know
[1:03:49] and some people the devil says no you
[1:03:51] don't want to live this day that's
[1:03:52] demonic
[1:03:54] i believe there's a spirit inside of us
[1:03:56] even the spirit of life that's in us
[1:03:58] that
[1:03:58] our human spirit wants to live
[1:04:01] our natural human spirit like a plant a
[1:04:03] plant when it grows it naturally wants
[1:04:05] to live let me live man you put an
[1:04:08] environment where it can't strive it
[1:04:09] will start to die but it's not because
[1:04:10] the plant says i give up it's just
[1:04:12] because it's in an environment where
[1:04:14] the life can't become all that it could
[1:04:15] be it maybe you put it don't give it
[1:04:17] water or you don't treat that life right
[1:04:19] but the life
[1:04:20] as soon as you change the environment on
[1:04:22] that plant if you put in a different
[1:04:23] environment where where the life can now
[1:04:25] live the life will just live and i
[1:04:27] believe
[1:04:28] like like paul said in the bible and it
[1:04:30] almost doesn't stand true today though
[1:04:31] it is true he said no man hated his own
[1:04:33] flesh
[1:04:34] and yet people cut their own flesh and
[1:04:36] they do things to it they hate it
[1:04:39] but i believe he's talking about no man
[1:04:40] like no
[1:04:41] he's not demons hate our flesh these
[1:04:43] people get demons on them and it's a
[1:04:45] demon that hates their flesh that's
[1:04:46] right but that man or that woman doesn't
[1:04:48] hate their flesh it's not them it's just
[1:04:49] these demons
[1:04:51] they
[1:04:52] you know so we we have to every day we
[1:04:54] need answers do i live and if i'm going
[1:04:57] to live what am i going to do now where
[1:04:58] do i go because we're traveling through
[1:05:00] time we can't just sit
[1:05:02] we're answering questions all the time
[1:05:03] you know every day you're you're making
[1:05:05] decisions all day every day some are
[1:05:08] small some are big like i always say
[1:05:10] there are small days there are big days
[1:05:11] some days it just sort of hat the day
[1:05:12] just happens with
[1:05:14] relative normality other days a big
[1:05:16] thing happens wow i lost my job or this
[1:05:18] happens and it's a big day or there's a
[1:05:20] big opportunity came or something
[1:05:21] happens
[1:05:23] okay and also on top of that there are a
[1:05:26] lot of answers that are given to us in
[1:05:27] this generation all the time you feed
[1:05:30] answers this is the answer this is the
[1:05:32] answer this is the answer
[1:05:33] and it actually if you don't watch it it
[1:05:35] can actually
[1:05:36] affect psychologically affect your mind
[1:05:38] if you listen to the wrong answer too
[1:05:39] much
[1:05:40] that's why it affects you the the things
[1:05:42] you watch
[1:05:43] even news that if you watch a certain
[1:05:45] slide of news there are always
[1:05:47] opinions that are put out that can
[1:05:49] affect psychologically your
[1:05:51] your take on what would be a godly
[1:05:53] answer like if you watch too much of
[1:05:55] these debates about that stuff i was
[1:05:57] talking about the trans stuff you would
[1:05:59] you would start to reason with some of
[1:06:00] the not not the radical parts of it but
[1:06:02] some of the less radical stuff you're
[1:06:03] like oh they do have a bit of a point
[1:06:04] there this maybe maybe people are yeah
[1:06:07] people are maybe more feminine does that
[1:06:08] sort of
[1:06:09] you know if you if if you let that
[1:06:12] influence you too much this is why the
[1:06:14] lord said that we should spend time with
[1:06:15] believers
[1:06:16] because believers that are filled with
[1:06:18] the holy ghost
[1:06:19] that tell you god's answers all the time
[1:06:21] they're speaking to you and they're
[1:06:22] saying to you the truth and that's
[1:06:23] that's fellowship if that's why the
[1:06:25] bible says what fellowship has light
[1:06:26] with darkness how can they
[1:06:28] fellowship together brother brown said
[1:06:30] if you get a bad woman and a good man or
[1:06:32] a good man and a bad woman they will
[1:06:33] eventually go either this way or that
[1:06:35] way together yes that there will be a
[1:06:38] tussle and whichever whichever one has
[1:06:40] the most
[1:06:41] force that could make it happen they
[1:06:43] will influence one that's why it affects
[1:06:44] what friends you have
[1:06:46] we should have godly friends that will
[1:06:48] always give us godly answers
[1:06:50] that's why there's a that's the reason
[1:06:51] why there's a unity in our fellowship is
[1:06:53] because we all follow the same answer
[1:06:55] therefore when we fellowship is there's
[1:06:57] a there's a kindred spirit and there's a
[1:06:58] kindred answer there's kindred
[1:06:59] fellowship there's not confusion because
[1:07:01] we're listening to the same answer so we
[1:07:03] can fellowship yes how can two walk
[1:07:05] together unless they'll be agreed well
[1:07:06] we can we can sit and agree
[1:07:09] amen this is sometimes what our
[1:07:12] what we get to in life we get to these
[1:07:14] junctions in life no doubt you have been
[1:07:16] you have come up against a lot of these
[1:07:17] junctions in your life and you say which
[1:07:19] way do i go
[1:07:20] this could be
[1:07:22] in the natural path you're going to take
[1:07:23] it could be as simple as you could be
[1:07:24] driving on a road naturally which way do
[1:07:26] i go which way is
[1:07:28] is um
[1:07:29] whanganui is it left straight ahead or
[1:07:31] right or which way is their house you
[1:07:33] know
[1:07:34] or it could come down into a natural
[1:07:36] sense do i take this job do i take that
[1:07:38] job do i take that job
[1:07:40] or do i in this situation do i steal it
[1:07:43] do i not steal it do i
[1:07:45] tell someone about it you know you've
[1:07:46] got these options
[1:07:47] you all come up to this point
[1:07:50] and
[1:07:54] but
[1:07:55] this is now just a normal piece of robe
[1:07:56] where you're traveling along this is
[1:07:58] actually where satan tries to get all
[1:07:59] his
[1:08:00] mess with us is when we're just
[1:08:01] traveling along here
[1:08:03] as well because
[1:08:04] he wants to throw on the wrong answer so
[1:08:06] that when we get to this point we go the
[1:08:07] wrong way so as we're traveling along
[1:08:09] he's he's always
[1:08:11] i'm going to get to you personally soon
[1:08:12] but i just want to lay these
[1:08:14] things out
[1:08:15] about
[1:08:18] let me explain it in this term as you're
[1:08:19] traveling along the road you don't have
[1:08:21] to make a decision this now this is this
[1:08:23] is just an example i've used to
[1:08:25] just cement this fact that i'm trying to
[1:08:27] talk about
[1:08:29] if you're traveling along the road and
[1:08:31] you want an answer about what you should
[1:08:32] do with your
[1:08:34] like whether you should
[1:08:35] in today's terms sleep around or not you
[1:08:38] look in the word of god and the answer
[1:08:39] says no
[1:08:41] so you're traveling along this road and
[1:08:42] you you should be studious like like
[1:08:45] david said thy word have a hidden mind
[1:08:46] heart that i might not sin against you
[1:08:48] you should be studious
[1:08:49] before you have to make a choice you
[1:08:51] should know what choice you need to make
[1:08:52] there are a lot of things you could
[1:08:54] actually
[1:08:55] learn now so when you come to the
[1:08:56] crossroad you know okay this is the way
[1:08:58] very simple i've learned this i'll go
[1:09:00] that way that's what david meant by that
[1:09:02] he said if i if i read your word if i
[1:09:03] know what it says i fellowship with
[1:09:05] brethren i get the right answer
[1:09:07] when i come up to that point when i come
[1:09:09] up to the option of doing this i know
[1:09:11] how to not sin against you this is easy
[1:09:13] it's that way
[1:09:14] your word says do this the opportunity
[1:09:16] may come up and you say no i will go
[1:09:18] this way
[1:09:19] okay
[1:09:20] and then
[1:09:22] and then you decide
[1:09:24] then then
[1:09:26] then when then you may the lord may you
[1:09:28] may be married and then on that same
[1:09:30] path you think well now the answer is
[1:09:32] when it comes up to committing adultery
[1:09:33] you know the answer no i don't do that i
[1:09:35] don't go down that road i go this way
[1:09:37] that's very simple but i want to point
[1:09:38] to you as a
[1:09:39] because people get this answer wrong and
[1:09:41] the reason why we've got so much
[1:09:42] confusion is so much mess and families
[1:09:45] in this life is because simple answers
[1:09:47] like this are not followed
[1:09:49] so different roads are taken and we've
[1:09:50] got a mess we've got families we've got
[1:09:52] there there is mess amongst the world
[1:09:55] because there's a simple answer that
[1:09:57] wasn't followed
[1:09:58] the lord gave an answer this is the
[1:10:00] answer amen okay hallelujah
[1:10:02] so when you're married you do not you do
[1:10:05] not be unfaithful you you this is what
[1:10:06] you do that's the answer
[1:10:09] now
[1:10:10] i want to point out the real answer
[1:10:12] no
[1:10:14] the real answer is actually
[1:10:16] receiving the lord and receiving
[1:10:18] salvation is realised are these here
[1:10:20] you could do all this
[1:10:21] and not receive the lord and you still
[1:10:22] won't win the game of life
[1:10:24] so these are this is just an example as
[1:10:26] you travel along the road
[1:10:28] and then but then picking someone that
[1:10:29] you want to marry the lord says be
[1:10:32] careful when you do get married don't
[1:10:33] marry someone that doesn't believe like
[1:10:34] you
[1:10:35] because you'll have this sort of trouble
[1:10:37] will they go your way they might
[1:10:39] but they may not
[1:10:41] now we don't know what that may be we
[1:10:43] may try and think well maybe they will
[1:10:44] but we don't know that for a fact so the
[1:10:46] lord says just be careful go with
[1:10:48] someone that believes the same as you
[1:10:50] see be not unequally yoked
[1:10:53] with an unbeliever
[1:10:55] it
[1:10:56] because you may come up to a to a
[1:10:57] position in the road where you've got
[1:10:59] the option oh do i go this way where i
[1:11:01] just carry on with nobody or do i go
[1:11:02] that way where i go with an unbeliever
[1:11:04] that may be you you're you're you're a
[1:11:06] point in the road that you you need to
[1:11:07] take or you need to make a choice i'm
[1:11:09] just
[1:11:10] i'm not saying this about anything i
[1:11:11] just this is just an example that
[1:11:13] we can
[1:11:14] now when you are with them
[1:11:16] it says don't leave them
[1:11:18] the lord says when you so when you come
[1:11:20] up to the opportunity where you think i
[1:11:21] may leave this person you think no i'm
[1:11:23] not going to leave this person
[1:11:25] so it's the answer the answer no i'm not
[1:11:26] going to leave
[1:11:27] i'm going to stick this one out
[1:11:29] for better for worse that's what i said
[1:11:30] i'll do and that's the answer so if we
[1:11:32] follow the answers
[1:11:35] i can assure you
[1:11:37] when you if you follow the answers every
[1:11:38] time you come up to this crossroad
[1:11:40] if you follow the answer the lord said
[1:11:42] you won't run into trouble amen okay
[1:11:45] that you you got to that that's that's
[1:11:47] the way
[1:11:48] but now let
[1:11:49] let's say
[1:11:51] let's say this one let's say the theory
[1:11:53] here is another answer just try before
[1:11:55] you buy you just sleep around
[1:11:57] that's that's that's an answer that's
[1:11:59] given and that answer is is accepted
[1:12:03] by i would say 95 percent of population
[1:12:04] just accept it or more just accept that
[1:12:06] answer yeah it's all right if it doesn't
[1:12:08] work just get someone else there's
[1:12:09] another answer if you get to the
[1:12:10] crossroad you get to a crossroads just
[1:12:12] try before you buy
[1:12:14] you get to the crossroad where you want
[1:12:15] to leave it's not working out over you
[1:12:16] i'll go to someone else that's the
[1:12:18] answer and that's the road you'll go
[1:12:20] down
[1:12:21] uh even abortion if you don't want the
[1:12:22] baby just abort it that's an answer
[1:12:25] you see that that becomes an answer to a
[1:12:27] road to follow
[1:12:29] and
[1:12:30] or maybe they don't abort them but they
[1:12:32] have this children and then after a
[1:12:33] while they get to the crossroad where
[1:12:34] i'm sick of this i want someone else and
[1:12:36] they and that family gets split up
[1:12:37] broken up and then they go with someone
[1:12:39] else
[1:12:40] it's very common today
[1:12:42] but the result is following the wrong
[1:12:44] answers
[1:12:46] see
[1:12:47] that that's what that's what it all
[1:12:48] comes down to and the
[1:12:51] this is real simple stuff if you look at
[1:12:53] these answers look at the results
[1:12:55] they've gotten
[1:12:56] but people won't accept the right answer
[1:12:58] because why it's demonic
[1:13:00] because there are demons that are
[1:13:01] pushing these there's a force of demons
[1:13:03] that are always saying this to people
[1:13:05] that's right and no doubt you if you've
[1:13:07] got non-christian friends this is what
[1:13:08] they are going to think
[1:13:10] this is natural this is the way that the
[1:13:11] natural
[1:13:13] world thinks they
[1:13:14] they think
[1:13:16] they think just like this
[1:13:18] but we don't think like this
[1:13:23] okay that was just an example to to show
[1:13:26] you
[1:13:26] answers matter
[1:13:28] answers matter a lot
[1:13:31] there was a
[1:13:32] there was a gathering about like this
[1:13:34] and they were talking about it was a
[1:13:36] non-christian event and they were
[1:13:37] talking about
[1:13:38] um
[1:13:39] uh how to
[1:13:41] like stds and sexually transmitted
[1:13:43] diseases and how you can avoid some of
[1:13:44] that and this and that just but a very
[1:13:46] carnal a non-christian way that says
[1:13:48] it's okay just all the stuff to avoid it
[1:13:50] and
[1:13:52] and halfway through they said oh we're
[1:13:53] going to break now for a
[1:13:55] a cup of um
[1:13:57] a cup of coffee and biscuits and stuff
[1:14:01] before that this lady had said to the
[1:14:03] crowd she said what about abstination
[1:14:05] what about just not doing it they said
[1:14:06] oh no that's not it's not an option
[1:14:09] that wasn't an answer oh no we can't
[1:14:11] have that answer we've got to have these
[1:14:12] other answers
[1:14:14] we only want we only want these answers
[1:14:16] but we want to figure out how to make
[1:14:17] these answers work they don't work
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:20] but she said what about just not doing
[1:14:21] it no no no that's not an answer and
[1:14:23] this gathering
[1:14:24] so then they had a break
[1:14:26] and they all had coffee and mingled
[1:14:30] mixed and mingled together and
[1:14:32] and
[1:14:33] she she just felt like i don't want to
[1:14:35] go and have a coffee and a biscuit i
[1:14:38] just want to go over here and i'll just
[1:14:39] stay over here and i won't have a have a
[1:14:41] coffee she didn't know why that she was
[1:14:42] a christian she just felt like i'll just
[1:14:43] go and do that
[1:14:44] and the lady that was running the show
[1:14:46] kept on saying come and have some come
[1:14:48] and have some um
[1:14:50] coffee and biscuits she said no no it's
[1:14:52] fine i'm i don't feel like eating and
[1:14:53] i'm no i'm good thanks i'll just i'll
[1:14:55] wait till the session starts again then
[1:14:56] we'll come in
[1:14:57] again
[1:14:58] now this lady in all her wisdom she
[1:15:00] thought that the the lady that running
[1:15:01] the show she got everyone together she
[1:15:03] said right now i'll show you how this
[1:15:04] works you see now we all stopped for a
[1:15:06] coffee now who talks with who
[1:15:08] you see where i'm going oh you talked
[1:15:10] with him
[1:15:11] oh then you talk with them you talk with
[1:15:12] them they show that everyone makes a
[1:15:13] mingle so that these sexy transmitted
[1:15:15] diseases can all go through everyone and
[1:15:17] all see this this is if there was no
[1:15:18] protection it's all just going to spread
[1:15:20] through you
[1:15:21] and then this lady put her head up and
[1:15:22] said hang on
[1:15:23] i abstained from mixing and mingling so
[1:15:26] i've got nothing
[1:15:26] [Laughter]
[1:15:29] see
[1:15:30] it's like
[1:15:32] christian god's answers always work it
[1:15:34] always makes sense it's like
[1:15:35] this is simple stuff yes
[1:15:38] the liam understands this alien easy
[1:15:41] yeah see
[1:15:43] the lord's people are intelligent
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] amen now i want to i want to just
[1:15:49] quickly i want to bring this to like a
[1:15:52] sort of a global
[1:15:54] more of an overview but i really want to
[1:15:56] talk about us
[1:15:57] personally
[1:15:59] here is a question that somebody asked
[1:16:00] in in the
[1:16:02] jerusalem just
[1:16:04] after their pentecost now when they had
[1:16:05] heard this they were pricked to their
[1:16:06] heart and said unto peter and the rest
[1:16:08] of the apostles men and brethren what
[1:16:10] shall we do there's a question
[1:16:11] because peter has said to them you're
[1:16:13] lost you've done this you've crucified
[1:16:15] the messiah you're in an awful place
[1:16:17] so they had a problem and they said
[1:16:19] what's the answer tell us the answer
[1:16:21] and peter gave them an answer
[1:16:23] that still stands today he said repent
[1:16:25] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:16:27] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:16:28] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:16:29] gift of the holy ghost he gave an answer
[1:16:32] they said we've got a big problem what's
[1:16:34] the solution what's the answer here's
[1:16:36] the solution now anyone that will follow
[1:16:38] that solution
[1:16:40] will come out all right you'll get the
[1:16:41] answer you'll get what peter said
[1:16:42] because he said now the for the promise
[1:16:44] or the answer is to you to your children
[1:16:46] then if as many as the lord our god
[1:16:48] shall call meaning this answer is going
[1:16:49] to stand forever this is the answer if
[1:16:51] you want salvation this is it amen okay
[1:16:54] so that's the answer real simple you
[1:16:55] want you want the answer what shall we
[1:16:57] do here it is here there's the answer

[1:17:24] just if you miss christmas oh man your
[1:17:25] soul's hanging in the balance because
[1:17:27] you miss the christmas you know poor
[1:17:30] catholic these poor guys i think man
[1:17:31] that would be awful i don't really like
[1:17:33] going to church on christmas day if it
[1:17:34] falls on a sunday
[1:17:37] i'm like man come on it's like it's like
[1:17:39] my holiday man it's like the poor the
[1:17:40] family's here and like just
[1:17:43] like becca but i don't feel bad i'm like
[1:17:44] hey man i'm at church every other day
[1:17:46] sunday of the year there wednesdays you
[1:17:48] know it's like a different everyone's on
[1:17:50] holiday it's just different
[1:17:53] now i can almost justify that right
[1:17:54] people were like whoa
[1:17:57] but i feel sorry for these catholics
[1:17:59] they never go to church all year then
[1:18:00] the one time and all the family visits
[1:18:02] they've got to go to church it's like
[1:18:03] you poor guy man just goes throughout
[1:18:05] the year
[1:18:06] make it easy on yourself
[1:18:08] i shouldn't laugh about it but
[1:18:10] this is
[1:18:11] this is the answer that was given over
[1:18:13] time this answer was given
[1:18:15] and it didn't produce any results
[1:18:16] because the other answer produces the
[1:18:18] holy ghost
[1:18:19] which changes lives and it puts us into
[1:18:22] fellowship with the lord and then he the
[1:18:25] holy ghost begins to teach us all things
[1:18:27] we we
[1:18:28] we hear his word for our day that we
[1:18:30] grow and cry somewhere it's like we're a
[1:18:32] tree planted outside the sun's hitting
[1:18:33] us everything's going well we're
[1:18:34] thriving
[1:18:36] these are the trees that accept that
[1:18:37] answer the reason why we have to get is
[1:18:39] this plastic
[1:18:41] they have to get plastic in here because
[1:18:42] they can't live you know
[1:18:44] they're not designed to survive under
[1:18:46] this environment this answer
[1:18:48] the answer is outside under the sun of
[1:18:50] god with the light of god's word shining
[1:18:51] upon them and then they live the
[1:18:53] answer's not in here this this
[1:18:55] environment here is not where where
[1:18:57] these plants are supposed to be
[1:19:00] but
[1:19:01] the lord saw that the reason why we got
[1:19:03] sent to profit was because this was the
[1:19:05] main answer being given and there was
[1:19:07] confusion and it wasn't producing any
[1:19:09] results
[1:19:10] that's right you see like
[1:19:12] like the worst result you can have the
[1:19:14] the number one answer that we need is is
[1:19:17] the first thing we need to answer is is
[1:19:19] there a god the first thing we have to
[1:19:20] say is yes
[1:19:22] he that comes to god must believe that
[1:19:24] he is so that's the first answer we must
[1:19:25] say uh yes there is a god because when
[1:19:27] you acknowledge that it opens the
[1:19:29] channels up to start to have a
[1:19:31] conversation okay if there's a god who
[1:19:33] are you
[1:19:34] if i've got a creator who are you
[1:19:36] because that puts me in a
[1:19:38] in a position where i'm sort of below
[1:19:40] something what am i below who are you
[1:19:43] and is there anything that i have to do
[1:19:45] which is essentially what those men ask
[1:19:46] men in brisbane what must we do
[1:19:48] now they were i think some of them may
[1:19:50] have believed there was a god some of
[1:19:52] them maybe didn't because there was a
[1:19:53] multitude of men around even though they
[1:19:55] were jerusalem they were from different
[1:19:56] parts of the world but i think the ones
[1:19:58] that asset had this they sort of knew
[1:20:00] there's something more than just us
[1:20:01] that's where you've got to start that's
[1:20:03] why sometimes
[1:20:04] other cultures outside of the west have
[1:20:06] more of a chance for the gospel to reach
[1:20:07] them because they already have an
[1:20:08] understanding there is more to life than
[1:20:09] this stuff here
[1:20:11] they're natural things so when you when
[1:20:12] the gospel is preached they can they can
[1:20:14] see well yes i know there's something
[1:20:16] else what's your version of what it is
[1:20:18] and if there's power within that they're
[1:20:19] like well this version of what they say
[1:20:21] is who this god is because they may have
[1:20:23] had other gods the sun god this god the
[1:20:25] tree god this idol of stone but when
[1:20:27] they hear about this god and then the
[1:20:29] presence of god comes and maybe healings
[1:20:30] happen they say okay the god that you're
[1:20:32] talking about there's something real to
[1:20:33] this
[1:20:34] uh my friend couldn't walk now he can
[1:20:35] walk yeah that's right who is this god
[1:20:37] you know that
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:39] that's the and when we when we receive
[1:20:42] that answer then we say well what must
[1:20:43] we do and we receive this answer that's
[1:20:45] the way we go but the lord
[1:20:47] god looked down and saw that the world
[1:20:49] was full of confusion because
[1:20:51] of this sort of answer was given now
[1:20:53] this is all from satan yeah
[1:20:55] man didn't conjure the sun these these
[1:20:58] the people that came up with these
[1:20:59] answers they didn't think of them of
[1:21:00] themselves
[1:21:01] we actually don't come up with answers
[1:21:03] believe it or not
[1:21:04] we are like sheep sheep don't know what
[1:21:06] they're doing they just get led we get
[1:21:08] lead
[1:21:09] every thought that we have was given to
[1:21:10] us by somebody
[1:21:12] somebody
[1:21:13] now eventu now if i follow this idea
[1:21:16] then i i got an answer from satan
[1:21:19] say well
[1:21:20] no satan didn't talk to me yeah well he
[1:21:23] somewhere along the line he talked to
[1:21:24] somebody they talked to somebody they
[1:21:25] talk to somebody they talk to somebody
[1:21:26] and then they talk to you where is the
[1:21:28] origin of that answer it's in hell
[1:21:30] that's where it comes from
[1:21:31] or paul's answer where was the origin of
[1:21:33] that answer it was from
[1:21:35] so the son of god
[1:21:37] okay
[1:21:39] this is why jesus said elias shall truly
[1:21:42] come first and restore all things
[1:21:44] now we live and that's why i say
[1:21:46] globally
[1:21:47] generally we live in a time if we
[1:21:48] receive this message of this hour we
[1:21:50] live in live in a time of answers we can
[1:21:52] have answers to all of this so we don't
[1:21:53] need to walk around confused that's why
[1:21:55] we live in an eagle age the anointing is
[1:21:57] eagle so which could fly up look around
[1:21:59] and not be confused
[1:22:01] eagles can see a long way and they can
[1:22:03] they can perceive
[1:22:04] that's why i say on a spiritual level as
[1:22:07] a global body of christ
[1:22:09] we live in a time of great answers
[1:22:11] hallelujah amen that's the age that we
[1:22:13] live in and the lord jesus wants to give
[1:22:15] you all the answers that you want he
[1:22:17] wants to answer all your questions
[1:22:19] that's what he does
[1:22:22] how does this affect you
[1:22:25] how does this affect you
[1:22:28] the first way that it affects you is as
[1:22:31] a general bride of christ we know
[1:22:33] how to live our general life with the
[1:22:35] general answers meaning
[1:22:36] there are answers that brother andy is
[1:22:38] going to get that i'm going to get
[1:22:40] it's just like we're going to get the
[1:22:41] same answer
[1:22:42] on general things like like um
[1:22:46] this
[1:22:47] this up here this is a general answer
[1:22:50] relative to andy relative to me relative
[1:22:51] to megan relative to everyone
[1:22:53] the this is
[1:22:55] you know the the word of god has general
[1:22:57] answers that if we in general have to
[1:22:59] we all just accept if we come into the
[1:23:01] light of god's word
[1:23:04] and
[1:23:04] you understand that's there's general
[1:23:06] answers and that that actually is what
[1:23:07] gives us unity amongst the believers is
[1:23:10] that we are following the same general
[1:23:11] answer so we can have unity
[1:23:14] the problem we've got in these countries
[1:23:16] and in western countries now as you can
[1:23:18] see there's disunity
[1:23:20] when a country serves god and there's a
[1:23:22] general idea that we are going to serve
[1:23:24] this power and we are going to do these
[1:23:25] certain things
[1:23:27] then even in a country there's unity
[1:23:29] that's why the bible says it's a
[1:23:30] precious thing it's actually a blessing
[1:23:32] of god when there's unity yes because
[1:23:34] when there's unity things can work
[1:23:35] together what you're seeing now is
[1:23:37] disunity in countries because there are
[1:23:39] people that now learn no longer want
[1:23:41] that answer i refuse that answer
[1:23:43] and this
[1:23:44] it's growing so there's a growing
[1:23:46] division because there are more and more
[1:23:47] people that want a different answer than
[1:23:48] what the country was established on we
[1:23:50] want a different answer that's why
[1:23:51] you're in this country let's take away
[1:23:53] the
[1:23:54] national anthem we don't want that
[1:23:56] answer let's take away the the prayer at
[1:23:58] the
[1:23:58] in parliament we don't want that answer
[1:24:00] see there's a and it creates it's all
[1:24:03] right it's all right be happy about it i
[1:24:05] often say i read the news just to make
[1:24:07] sure everything's going down like it
[1:24:08] should be you know it's all falling
[1:24:09] apart like it should be
[1:24:10] have a quick read yep she's all falling
[1:24:12] apart it's right on track
[1:24:14] don't try and fight against it you're
[1:24:16] going to lose that's true there's no
[1:24:17] point fighting against this because this
[1:24:19] is the curse of
[1:24:21] of
[1:24:22] of shutting out light you get darkness
[1:24:24] that's right we always say that darkness
[1:24:26] is just the abscess of light if you
[1:24:28] don't want light you get darkness
[1:24:30] welcome to a world of darkness folks and
[1:24:31] it's only going to get darker and more
[1:24:33] confused so don't try and
[1:24:35] christians now trying to fight against
[1:24:36] that they're wasting their time exactly
[1:24:38] they're not going to win
[1:24:39] i believe it's going to be twisted
[1:24:40] around so that it's going to come from
[1:24:42] the pressure will come from christians
[1:24:44] not non-christians and you'll see you'll
[1:24:46] see what i mean
[1:24:47] like
[1:24:49] people think the mark of the beast is
[1:24:50] going to be this evil thing christians
[1:24:52] won't accept that that's what they're
[1:24:53] fighting as for you watch if they win
[1:24:55] this realm which i think they currently
[1:24:56] will win this big movement that's
[1:24:57] happening globally there's a massive
[1:24:58] movement they will probably win and they
[1:25:00] will probably implement it themselves to
[1:25:01] keep that away yeah and it will be from
[1:25:03] them but they will accept it because
[1:25:04] it's from us
[1:25:05] that's how cunning
[1:25:07] just watch it
[1:25:08] just watch it i think it's going to work
[1:25:10] that way
[1:25:13] so that's general right we have unity
[1:25:14] amongst us
[1:25:16] when people follow the same thing
[1:25:17] there's unity that's why if you if you
[1:25:19] go with a marry a believer
[1:25:21] you're going to generally your
[1:25:22] conversations within
[1:25:24] this x amount of space are going to be
[1:25:26] in unity
[1:25:27] because you you you may differ very on
[1:25:29] these things those things just as people
[1:25:30] are but you're going to be gen and so
[1:25:31] you can walk together
[1:25:33] but if you go with people that don't
[1:25:34] believe like you
[1:25:36] then you're going to have more disunity
[1:25:39] okay
[1:25:41] and
[1:25:42] even in churches man there's i mean i
[1:25:44] used to be involved in a lot of them and
[1:25:45] it's it's very confusing because one
[1:25:46] person comes up one week and speaks one
[1:25:48] thing and then the next one comes and
[1:25:49] speaks another thing
[1:25:51] and then the next one gives a message
[1:25:52] about this and a prophecy about this and
[1:25:54] it's all just confusing because no one's
[1:25:57] they're all given different answers so
[1:25:59] they're all just trying to push their
[1:26:00] own answer yeah brother branham said
[1:26:02] even he said in the bigger cities he
[1:26:03] said there's more confusion when i go
[1:26:04] around to the bigger cities there's a
[1:26:06] lot more confusion they said like miami
[1:26:07] and california when i go there the
[1:26:09] people are more confused he said because
[1:26:10] people there's a lot of people coming
[1:26:12] and going from those cities someone
[1:26:14] comes in with the wrong answer
[1:26:16] and he said
[1:26:18] because it's such a big place on the
[1:26:19] balance of probabilities there are some
[1:26:20] people that agree with that answer so
[1:26:22] they gather together and they start
[1:26:23] causing trouble to think we don't want
[1:26:25] to be a part of you anymore we've got
[1:26:26] this answer and the ability for it all
[1:26:28] to get confusing and
[1:26:30] and fractured is greater in bigger
[1:26:32] cities you see that's why when i go
[1:26:33] there there's just there's confusion he
[1:26:34] said i go to miami it's confusion when i
[1:26:36] turn up there
[1:26:38] right because they're not getting
[1:26:40] they're actually not getting the same
[1:26:42] general answer
[1:26:43] okay so if you want to know why we've
[1:26:44] got unity here
[1:26:46] like i believe each one
[1:26:48] and here you all appreciate brother ben
[1:26:50] is your pastor amen right
[1:26:53] now because of that you can you can
[1:26:55] sense the unity because of that the
[1:26:57] blessing of god in the presence of god
[1:26:58] is upon that to bless it but if i said
[1:27:00] oh who likes brother ben is that pastor
[1:27:02] this guy said yes and said no no someone
[1:27:04] else they wrote this one and that one
[1:27:05] and get this one no no pastor we should
[1:27:06] have this that then it wouldn't have the
[1:27:08] same atmosphere that we've got right but
[1:27:10] because because we follow the word of
[1:27:12] god and we see it and we feel the pull
[1:27:14] of the lord and then we see okay we can
[1:27:15] identify how we should treat men of god
[1:27:18] and we've identified this then we've
[1:27:19] come in to and we're reading from the
[1:27:21] same answer we have unity
[1:27:23] okay
[1:27:25] but now we come to this interesting part
[1:27:30] is that some answers are not as easy to
[1:27:32] come by as others like if you ask me a
[1:27:34] question should i
[1:27:35] maybe be with someone before i got
[1:27:37] married i'd be like no that's an easy
[1:27:38] that's an easy question no it's not it's
[1:27:41] straightforward right yes
[1:27:43] and you could say the same answer to
[1:27:44] everyone else and it would stand true
[1:27:46] liam could say the same answer to his
[1:27:47] friends it would always stand true
[1:27:48] because it's a general answer but but we
[1:27:50] have
[1:27:51] we we have our personal
[1:27:54] questions in our own life that are only
[1:27:56] relevant to us
[1:27:57] the answer to me may not be the same as
[1:27:59] you
[1:28:01] right and
[1:28:03] the issue with this is we have got
[1:28:04] invested interest in the answer like it
[1:28:06] matters if i don't get the answer man it
[1:28:08] may not matter to you because you're not
[1:28:09] the one that has to decide whether you
[1:28:10] take this job or not but it matters to
[1:28:12] me you say i'll just pray about it i've
[1:28:14] always thought what's easy if you say
[1:28:15] that man you i've got to make a decision
[1:28:17] in the morning i came to you for some
[1:28:18] advice man i just don't pray you're like
[1:28:19] what do you think
[1:28:22] like because your day will go on and you
[1:28:24] don't have to
[1:28:26] you don't worry you're just like come on
[1:28:27] man enter into my burden man what do i
[1:28:29] do man
[1:28:31] just pray
[1:28:32] now i know that's the answer but
[1:28:33] sometimes we you know yeah
[1:28:35] i'd say look if it was me you know
[1:28:39] but
[1:28:40] there are decisions we have to make
[1:28:41] we'll touch on some of those number
[1:28:43] i've got about three different types of
[1:28:45] questions that we are going to be asking
[1:28:48] some questions we ask that the answer
[1:28:50] doesn't really matter and it's it's got
[1:28:52] no invested interest we just we just
[1:28:54] wonder about something right like
[1:28:56] you know there are questions like that
[1:28:57] we can sort of put these questions in
[1:28:59] different categories so you would have
[1:29:01] these questions that
[1:29:02] if you asked brother andy for the answer
[1:29:04] he couldn't tell you it wouldn't really
[1:29:06] bother you and then you don't have to
[1:29:08] act on the answer anyway so it's like oh
[1:29:09] well just
[1:29:10] to stay not knowing maybe one day i'll
[1:29:12] find out i'll give you some examples in
[1:29:13] a little bit
[1:29:14] or then
[1:29:16] there are other questions of why
[1:29:17] something is like it is in your life
[1:29:19] well why is this like this i know you've
[1:29:21] all got those questions why is something
[1:29:22] like this in my life what is it
[1:29:25] these are the sort of answers that the
[1:29:27] lord wants to tell you he wants the lord
[1:29:29] knows the answers
[1:29:32] to all these questions and these are the
[1:29:33] answers we're in a time where even those
[1:29:35] questions well why is something like it
[1:29:36] is in my life why is it
[1:29:38] he actually wants us to know the answers
[1:29:44] um
[1:29:47] hey there were a lot more just let me oh
[1:29:49] here sorry
[1:29:53] oh yeah okay i'll just go through
[1:29:55] i just want to go through this now there
[1:29:57] are different ways you can get answers
[1:29:58] and then i want to make it personal and
[1:30:00] bring some
[1:30:02] uh questions
[1:30:04] that you might have and i think some of
[1:30:05] them will be relative to you but the
[1:30:07] first answer is actually to pray about
[1:30:09] something right we say but that's
[1:30:10] sometimes just an easy yeah just pray
[1:30:12] about it but that actually means
[1:30:15] it doesn't mean okay if i i'm not
[1:30:17] praying now then when i go kneel down on
[1:30:19] that chair and i i say start my watch
[1:30:21] i'm praying then and then when i get up
[1:30:22] i'm not praying anymore you know like a
[1:30:24] certain time
[1:30:25] pray actually is more than that it's
[1:30:26] like get in a place where you can
[1:30:28] commune with the lord yes so you can
[1:30:31] hear an answer and get in a place where
[1:30:34] it doesn't matter which way the answer
[1:30:36] goes
[1:30:37] genuinely get in that place like whether
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:40] lord because if if we have a force of
[1:30:42] our human spirit to want to go a certain
[1:30:44] way that will override
[1:30:46] the spirit of god because the spirit of
[1:30:48] god doesn't push in so if our spirit
[1:30:50] really wants something
[1:30:52] all the praying in the world aren't
[1:30:53] going to help us because we're going to
[1:30:54] probably go that way anyway you see
[1:30:56] but we should still praying about it
[1:30:58] means we have the ability to get into a
[1:31:00] relationship with the lord the lord paid
[1:31:02] the price of our sin
[1:31:04] took it away so that we could enter into
[1:31:07] the holiest of holies and be in a place
[1:31:09] where there are all the answers that's
[1:31:11] what this is about you can enter in a
[1:31:13] place that has all the answers
[1:31:16] all the answers right
[1:31:18] uh you say then
[1:31:20] the next question you you the way you
[1:31:21] can actually look at if you should do
[1:31:22] something or not is does it all line up
[1:31:26] is it
[1:31:26] as is what i'm doing actually and then
[1:31:28] there's let's say if you want to do some
[1:31:30] physical some particular thing
[1:31:33] first you can line it up like um you
[1:31:35] know when you go on boats and i don't
[1:31:36] know if you've been on a boat and if you
[1:31:38] have to go through a channel and get
[1:31:39] back to the shore when you're out you
[1:31:40] don't know where the channel is because
[1:31:42] it's underwater but they put markers on
[1:31:44] the land and one down on the beach and
[1:31:46] that so as you drive your boat you can
[1:31:47] you line up these three markers and then
[1:31:49] you know if i go straight that direction
[1:31:50] i'll be in the channel
[1:31:52] they all line up like that
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] this was brother perry green's one that
[1:31:56] he always used he said he wants these
[1:31:58] three things to line up but is what i'm
[1:32:00] doing scriptural is it a scriptural
[1:32:01] thing yeah is it okay by the word of god
[1:32:03] the word of god condones it yes
[1:32:05] okay now secondly does my spirit have a
[1:32:07] witness do i feel in my spirit because
[1:32:09] that's an answer how do i feel about
[1:32:11] this or we don't go on feelings we
[1:32:12] actually do
[1:32:14] we do because we can sense the spirit of
[1:32:16] god you know when you're doing wrong
[1:32:17] someone said last week how do you know
[1:32:18] when you're doing wrong and the answer
[1:32:20] was because your conscience tells you
[1:32:22] what about when your conscience doesn't
[1:32:23] tell you and you feel like no this is
[1:32:24] okay you should be able to rely on how
[1:32:26] you you feel about something you should
[1:32:29] have a confidence towards the lord that
[1:32:30] if the same if you're spirits to me and
[1:32:32] i'm in harmony with your spirit then i
[1:32:34] can feel whether it's the right thing
[1:32:35] because you don't know why but you just
[1:32:37] feel like i just don't want to do it i
[1:32:38] don't know why
[1:32:40] other times you may think well i just
[1:32:42] want to do it i don't know why
[1:32:44] like i think i can share a little
[1:32:45] testimony maybe sister genie won't mind
[1:32:47] like
[1:32:51] this was one of those situations where
[1:32:54] we were sort of looking at a admin
[1:32:56] person and jenny's doing the church
[1:32:58] accounts and i thought she might maybe
[1:32:59] get her to do admin for other businesses
[1:33:01] but we don't really know what we're
[1:33:03] doing yet it's there's not really a job
[1:33:04] there as such it's just like
[1:33:06] there isn't there isn't it's kind of
[1:33:07] like we weren't looking for someone but
[1:33:10] but something about the situation where
[1:33:12] i i
[1:33:13] i kind of thought there was something
[1:33:16] this is just my answer i thought it just
[1:33:17] felt like i just think that i should for
[1:33:19] some reason i don't know why it just
[1:33:21] it
[1:33:23] it was a step of faith but it wasn't it
[1:33:24] was kind of like well but it but the
[1:33:27] answer wasn't oh should we work it out
[1:33:28] and see if we've got enough this and
[1:33:29] that and do it all naturally it was more
[1:33:31] the answer was more like well i just
[1:33:32] feel something about this i just feel to
[1:33:34] do it i don't know why i just do let's
[1:33:36] just
[1:33:37] let's just do it
[1:33:39] and i don't know but i didn't know her
[1:33:40] situation i've kind of found it
[1:33:43] i just found this interesting where she
[1:33:45] i think you must have been praying about
[1:33:47] it maybe
[1:33:48] because i think tamar um sister jenny
[1:33:51] has to work at nights in the hospital
[1:33:52] and tamar her daughter was the
[1:33:54] babysitter when she would go to work but
[1:33:55] now tamar left for when did she go to
[1:33:57] greece friday friday
[1:33:59] right but and i think we spoke to jenny
[1:34:01] on wednesday or something tuesday they
[1:34:03] said you know we just feel yeah you've
[1:34:04] got a job start monday and it's a work
[1:34:06] from home job because she didn't want to
[1:34:07] work at the hospital anymore but then
[1:34:09] tamar is going anyway so she can't go to
[1:34:11] from monday she couldn't go to work at
[1:34:13] the hospital anyway because she doesn't
[1:34:14] have a babysitter but i didn't know that
[1:34:16] stuff we just said yep no you can have a
[1:34:17] job and for some weird reason start
[1:34:18] monday just do it you know
[1:34:21] but
[1:34:22] it was i look at that that makes me feel
[1:34:24] good because you know when you do things
[1:34:26] when you follow the lord the lord always
[1:34:28] has a stamp on a
[1:34:30] situation like if you looked at someone
[1:34:33] that made something fantastic you'd
[1:34:34] think wow that's very well made
[1:34:36] there's a it's going to have an impact
[1:34:38] on you if something's not made very good
[1:34:39] you'll just brush it off it but when the
[1:34:41] lord does things he does it very good
[1:34:44] and you can see the hand like in that
[1:34:46] situation you can see i can see the hand
[1:34:48] of god here and then it gives you a
[1:34:49] confidence
[1:34:51] like brother
[1:34:52] i think jimmy i was sitting in my in my
[1:34:55] lounge this guy's not going to like me
[1:34:56] after this
[1:34:58] i was sitting in my lounge
[1:35:00] and
[1:35:01] there were a lot of things that i had to
[1:35:02] be doing but i was i was at the at one
[1:35:04] of our businesses too much and i was
[1:35:06] like i just can't be there anymore i
[1:35:07] need to do these other things that the
[1:35:09] time is ticking and i can't i need to
[1:35:11] allocate time to these other things
[1:35:13] so i sat in the lounge and i thought
[1:35:14] lord i need somebody to work in the
[1:35:16] factory
[1:35:17] just speak it out that's what you don't
[1:35:20] it's not demanding to the lord it's
[1:35:21] there's something in your spirit that
[1:35:23] feels like
[1:35:24] i feel like i should say this
[1:35:26] it's not like i'm just going to say this
[1:35:27] and demand it
[1:35:29] we shouldn't just say things like that
[1:35:30] without feeling like it's what we should
[1:35:33] we shouldn't do that's what i'm saying
[1:35:34] about you know the answer
[1:35:36] be confident you know the answer you can
[1:35:39] like i wouldn't just say something like
[1:35:40] that without feeling like no this is
[1:35:42] what i'm supposed to be doing because
[1:35:43] our words are powerful they speak and
[1:35:45] then it happens so be careful what we
[1:35:47] speak
[1:35:48] because i
[1:35:49] but something in me said okay i'm going
[1:35:51] to speak that because it's what has to
[1:35:53] happen because the lord has given me
[1:35:54] answers about the direction i'm supposed
[1:35:56] to go on and this is not it
[1:35:58] fully so i need to go this way so we
[1:35:59] need that answer
[1:36:02] i think it was and then someone maybe a
[1:36:04] few two weeks later or something someone
[1:36:06] randomly said oh they after the camp
[1:36:08] they were thinking of moving here
[1:36:10] it's like oh really it's interesting
[1:36:11] i'll just text him which i don't usually
[1:36:13] brother andy texts while you're still
[1:36:14] talking about or something he'll be
[1:36:16] texting the person
[1:36:17] two in the morning
[1:36:19] me i'm like i take it a bit slower you
[1:36:20] know just let's have think about this
[1:36:23] i i unusually just text them i thought
[1:36:25] i'm going to text them
[1:36:27] hey why don't you come here for a job
[1:36:28] boom
[1:36:29] just not thinking anything of it just
[1:36:31] fired it away
[1:36:33] i actually told you okay there andy told
[1:36:35] me
[1:36:36] he said i got a feeling in me
[1:36:38] two weeks earlier oh yeah
[1:36:42] so he was listening to the right station
[1:36:43] i was maybe not i wasn't tuned in as
[1:36:45] much
[1:36:47] he did it actually you're right
[1:36:49] right um
[1:36:50] but the uh the at the same time jimmy
[1:36:54] said lord if you want me to go there
[1:36:55] give me a house and give me a job
[1:36:58] so when we text you you've got a job
[1:36:59] here
[1:37:00] oh there's that was an answer there's
[1:37:02] one of them answers and i think you got
[1:37:03] a house
[1:37:04] like
[1:37:06] but
[1:37:07] that's what i mean about when something
[1:37:08] is of the lord you can see his hand upon
[1:37:10] it
[1:37:11] it's got nice handiwork it doesn't just
[1:37:13] it's not all hard and man there was such
[1:37:15] a lot of trouble to do that you know to
[1:37:17] get him down here and we had to
[1:37:18] negotiate and then we had to offer him
[1:37:20] way more than what we were going to and
[1:37:22] then he had all these terms and then we
[1:37:24] couldn't find him a house he had to stay
[1:37:26] at the back of the factory and they're
[1:37:27] just all you know
[1:37:28] the lord i mean sometimes you've got to
[1:37:30] push through things but the lord
[1:37:32] actually his answers always have a nice
[1:37:34] stamp on it that brings me to this other
[1:37:36] one if you want an answer you can put
[1:37:37] what they call put a fleece out
[1:37:39] now this this this comes from what
[1:37:42] gideon did
[1:37:43] the lord told gideon i'm going to
[1:37:45] deliver through you and he broke down
[1:37:47] his father's idols and that and then
[1:37:49] but he was a little bit unsure he said
[1:37:51] lord are you going to deliver by my hand
[1:37:53] or not he was still a bit unsure fleeces
[1:37:56] generally only work when you already
[1:37:57] have a feeling to do something like
[1:37:59] jimmy had a feeling already to move down
[1:38:01] to wellington so he says i just failed
[1:38:02] to go there but lord what he did was and
[1:38:05] we would call him in scriptural terms he
[1:38:07] put a fleece out lord if you want me to
[1:38:08] go make this happen now i suggest with
[1:38:11] your fleeces you don't speak it out
[1:38:13] you put it in here because satan will he
[1:38:15] if he's trying to trick you he'll hear
[1:38:16] what you say oh he wants that's his
[1:38:17] police all right make it happen if he
[1:38:20] knows you shouldn't do it or whatever
[1:38:21] you know like you keep those in your
[1:38:22] mind don't go and tell the church i'll
[1:38:24] put this fleece out you know
[1:38:26] even things that you're thinking of
[1:38:28] doing for the lord like brother brown
[1:38:29] said i wouldn't speak it out because
[1:38:30] satan will know my plans and then try
[1:38:31] and get ahead of me and mess them up you
[1:38:33] know
[1:38:34] but there is this term so gideon said
[1:38:36] i'll put this fleece out and if it's in
[1:38:38] the morning if the if the ground outside
[1:38:40] is dry and the fleece is wet then i know
[1:38:43] it's from you it may have been neither
[1:38:44] around but then the next night it
[1:38:45] happened the ground was dry the fleece
[1:38:47] was wet and he said oh lord forgive me
[1:38:49] but i just want one more confirmation
[1:38:51] tonight i'll put it out and then make
[1:38:52] the fleece be dry and the ground be wet
[1:38:54] and it was like how he said it so he got
[1:38:55] the two opposites he took that as
[1:38:57] confirmation where what you said to me
[1:39:00] is correct and i should go with it
[1:39:03] so that's another way we can find out if
[1:39:04] you know what an answer we can put a
[1:39:06] fleece out we can still do that that's
[1:39:08] why we call
[1:39:09] that's what jimmy did to put a fleece
[1:39:10] out if i get a job and then
[1:39:12] then the lord moves on my heart and we
[1:39:14] go hey here's the job and he create not
[1:39:15] only that he creates a situation so
[1:39:17] there is a job needed and that just all
[1:39:18] works yes right
[1:39:20] amen another one you can do if you're
[1:39:22] you can actually ask advice
[1:39:24] now you can go if you're younger even
[1:39:26] older you can go to your parents you go
[1:39:27] to your past you can go to your friends
[1:39:29] you do have to be careful who you go to
[1:39:31] and what because
[1:39:32] like if your parents are not believers
[1:39:34] and and you say oh look there's a job
[1:39:36] that in this particular town that's
[1:39:37] paying me twice as much as what i'm
[1:39:39] being paid now they'll stop you right
[1:39:40] there take it take it son good
[1:39:42] because they're only concerned about
[1:39:43] your financial well-being take it but if
[1:39:45] you came to me and said there's a job
[1:39:47] there i'll say what area oh is it is
[1:39:50] there a church around there no no not
[1:39:51] really a church are you planning on
[1:39:52] doing anything there not really
[1:39:54] i wouldn't take it if it was me i
[1:39:56] wouldn't take it no way that so that
[1:39:58] would be my advice so you've got to be
[1:39:59] careful what advice you get
[1:40:02] like
[1:40:03] friends if you've got friends that are
[1:40:04] believers they will no doubt probably
[1:40:06] give you
[1:40:07] friendly godly advice if they're
[1:40:09] believers they will tell you
[1:40:11] but if they're non-believers you go to
[1:40:12] them for advice
[1:40:14] they will probably not tell you the
[1:40:15] right advice so you must be a pastor a
[1:40:17] godly pastor always will give you good
[1:40:19] advice i believe
[1:40:21] you know they will because even godly
[1:40:23] parents parents kind of do just look at
[1:40:25] their their natural well-being and maybe
[1:40:27] a little they try and balance it all up
[1:40:29] you know
[1:40:30] but sometimes you just have to look at
[1:40:31] someone's spiritual well-being over
[1:40:33] their natural well-being and say this is
[1:40:35] maybe you want you to do here yeah but
[1:40:37] you see so different people will give
[1:40:38] you
[1:40:39] and then your friends will give you like
[1:40:41] an emotional well-being are you are you
[1:40:42] happy doing that you're not happy you
[1:40:44] know it's all about how you feel because
[1:40:46] they came for me more for you and that
[1:40:48] so
[1:40:49] whenever i ask advice i always take into
[1:40:51] account who am i asking and what answer
[1:40:53] are they likely going to give me that's
[1:40:54] right because you can just want to go
[1:40:56] and do something and ask advice from all
[1:40:57] the people that you know are going to
[1:40:58] tell you to do it then you're like they
[1:40:59] asked about five different people they
[1:41:00] all said yes
[1:41:02] but you knew and yourself that they were
[1:41:03] just going to give you this advice a
[1:41:04] certain way
[1:41:06] okay
[1:41:08] right
[1:41:10] but those are just i just gave you ways
[1:41:13] that you can
[1:41:14] get answers but i believe that the
[1:41:16] greatest way is having a where we can
[1:41:17] have a relationship now with the lord
[1:41:19] where through these different means we
[1:41:21] can know the answers we don't have to
[1:41:22] walk around confused like i said to
[1:41:24] shannon spen the other day just driving
[1:41:26] i said it's been such an enjoyable time
[1:41:27] here for the last 10 years because i
[1:41:29] haven't been confused i've known
[1:41:31] everything that's going to happen
[1:41:32] i said 10 years ago this is the way that
[1:41:34] it's all going to pan out this is what's
[1:41:35] going to happen and it's all panned out
[1:41:37] that way there hasn't been any oh wow i
[1:41:39] didn't think this was going to happen
[1:41:40] this way it's just happened because the
[1:41:42] lord said you're going to go there and
[1:41:43] this is going to happen that way even
[1:41:45] when we moved here we felt to move here
[1:41:48] and
[1:41:49] then we went around to a believer's
[1:41:51] house for like a bit of a dinner
[1:41:54] and this and we just told them oh we
[1:41:56] we're gonna move to wellington and that
[1:41:58] that one of the sisters there said well
[1:41:59] that's
[1:42:00] that's incredible i had a dream and i
[1:42:02] woke up in the morning i told my husband
[1:42:03] the least are going to move to
[1:42:04] wellington
[1:42:05] that's what she got told and was that
[1:42:06] correct
[1:42:07] yeah in her dream delays are going to
[1:42:08] move to wellington
[1:42:10] you get that you think okay well we're
[1:42:11] on the right track here she didn't we
[1:42:13] didn't mention anything about moving or
[1:42:14] nothing she just had this dream and then
[1:42:16] she told us
[1:42:18] us and then we were going to move so you
[1:42:20] think well i must be i'm on the right
[1:42:21] track then the lord sort of gives you
[1:42:22] little bits of confirmation
[1:42:24] then actually when we
[1:42:26] when we moved up to where we were
[1:42:29] i could suppose like i said i had to
[1:42:30] fight a pretty hard fight to get there
[1:42:34] none of my family wanted to go home and
[1:42:35] they're like no way they fought me i was
[1:42:38] i was
[1:42:39] the last man standing i just felt in my
[1:42:41] heart that was supposed to do this
[1:42:43] usually when shannon disagrees with me i
[1:42:45] kind of go oh there's a bit of a red
[1:42:46] flag okay um i won't do this i i i'm
[1:42:50] wiser now i know i've learned if she
[1:42:52] doesn't want to go along with it i
[1:42:54] generally question it i'm like why is
[1:42:56] she not wanting this you know and that's
[1:42:58] the way we should because it all gives
[1:42:59] us even close friends that will question
[1:43:01] the lord gives us those people we should
[1:43:03] sort of think hold back well why are you
[1:43:05] why is something in your spirit against
[1:43:06] us
[1:43:07] but
[1:43:08] that's the first time in a long time
[1:43:09] where here i think
[1:43:11] they've couldn't i don't think they've
[1:43:12] kiddie the way with all the children
[1:43:14] they all voted no man no stupid place
[1:43:16] not going and
[1:43:17] that was bad man and they were i'm gonna
[1:43:19] stay here like
[1:43:21] people were gonna i'm staying in this
[1:43:22] area you guys moved here i'm staying
[1:43:24] here by myself and like the whole family
[1:43:25] was going to break up it was serious man
[1:43:27] i'm like
[1:43:29] i was like
[1:43:31] oh man and shannon was all upset look
[1:43:33] now it's breaking up the whole family
[1:43:34] we're all going to be fractured now
[1:43:36] like no man i just said i just
[1:43:38] i feel that's where we should go we're
[1:43:40] just going to move there that's it and i
[1:43:42] said yes to the place yes yes yes look
[1:43:44] here yes we're going
[1:43:46] now not i was texting i'm not was it
[1:43:48] being harsh it was just like can't you
[1:43:50] see the hand of god in this whole thing
[1:43:51] i can just see the hand of god this is
[1:43:53] the direction we just need to go on it
[1:43:55] but it was difficult to push through the
[1:43:57] resistance and sometimes you have to but
[1:43:59] i wouldn't recommend you you should know
[1:44:00] when you should shouldn't you got to be
[1:44:02] but once again
[1:44:04] this is more of a
[1:44:06] it's like plastering as an actual
[1:44:09] skill you can't just say to someone go
[1:44:10] and plaster that wall
[1:44:11] you could say to someone bang a piece of
[1:44:13] board on that wall and most people could
[1:44:14] get it and bang a nail in and it could
[1:44:16] come out okay but you tell them to
[1:44:17] plaster it's a skill that you acquire
[1:44:19] over time so some of this stuff you just
[1:44:21] have to know
[1:44:22] but i believe the lord's work on each
[1:44:23] one of us we just you just know
[1:44:25] the answers you just feel it you kind of
[1:44:28] you shouldn't get wrong too many times
[1:44:29] the more you walk with the lord
[1:44:32] you should know and this is the time
[1:44:33] we're in as we're in the time of answers
[1:44:36] so
[1:44:37] so we
[1:44:38] we we moved there and we told our other
[1:44:40] neighbor down the bottom another
[1:44:42] christian family they came up to visit
[1:44:44] us and we said oh we're actually moving
[1:44:45] up to shannon
[1:44:47] and the lady that came up said that's
[1:44:49] amazing
[1:44:50] i had a dream
[1:44:51] and then i said in my dream i said isn't
[1:44:53] it funny shannon's moving to shannon
[1:44:57] she said i dreamt that shannon's moving
[1:44:59] to china are you moving to shannon here
[1:45:01] we are wow
[1:45:03] you see the cc
[1:45:04] [Laughter]
[1:45:09] no no no i often
[1:45:11] no i'm not going to confess that these
[1:45:13] days i believe the lord can give me the
[1:45:15] right answers i was going to say
[1:45:16] but i want to be wrong if i said i often
[1:45:18] get it wrong but we don't want to
[1:45:19] confess that because the lord can give
[1:45:22] us the answers
[1:45:23] that's the season we're in we're not in
[1:45:24] a season of confusion where we don't
[1:45:26] know the answers to our own lives now
[1:45:28] i'm talking about our own lives i'm
[1:45:29] talking about the answer that only you
[1:45:30] can get not me i can't get it for you
[1:45:33] like uh
[1:45:34] what should i be doing for the kingdom
[1:45:36] of god you might have that question
[1:45:37] god's got an answer for you yes amen now
[1:45:40] you must find the answer you have to
[1:45:42] but find the answer and if you believe
[1:45:45] you'll get the answer you'll get the
[1:45:46] answer this is actually a something we
[1:45:47] can lay hold of by faith
[1:45:50] you if you don't if you don't want to
[1:45:52] claim it then you will never have it but
[1:45:53] if you want to claim lord i can get the
[1:45:55] answer because we're in a time of
[1:45:57] answers that's something we can claim
[1:45:59] just like
[1:46:00] like i was going to speak that i don't
[1:46:01] really often get the answers that would
[1:46:03] be speaking unbelief that on something
[1:46:04] i'm trying to claim that's why i didn't
[1:46:05] say it and when i said it i said i don't
[1:46:07] i don't mean that you see because satan
[1:46:09] will try and twist around but it's legal
[1:46:10] stuff you know sometimes when i'm doing
[1:46:13] something and i might say
[1:46:17] something wrong out of my mouth i'll i
[1:46:19] will correct it in a legal way i'll
[1:46:20] never be able to do this you know say
[1:46:22] um
[1:46:23] but what i said wasn't true because i'm
[1:46:24] going to be able to do this you know so
[1:46:26] then if it legally comes up my word was
[1:46:29] void for what i said i said no i didn't
[1:46:31] that wasn't it matters what we say
[1:46:33] matters
[1:46:34] okay
[1:46:35] it matters so so when you want
[1:46:38] i want to confess to you the lord wants
[1:46:39] to give you the answers to this
[1:46:42] don't don't disbelieve it don't say well
[1:46:43] i'll never know you notice maybe no you
[1:46:45] will know you do have a purpose in the
[1:46:47] kingdom of god and you will get the
[1:46:48] answer amen i'm looking over at sister
[1:46:50] vanessa shannon was wondering about
[1:46:52] david and all that stuff dave was going
[1:46:54] through and she went i think to sister
[1:46:55] vanessa
[1:46:56] and sister vanessa told her i think this
[1:46:58] is true she said when i was praying
[1:47:00] about it i
[1:47:02] found that david wants to join a gang
[1:47:04] is that what she said
[1:47:06] david wants to join a gang she didn't
[1:47:07] know that david what did you want to do
[1:47:09] when you left and went out
[1:47:11] want to join a gang
[1:47:14] that like
[1:47:15] she said this is the problem he wants to
[1:47:16] join a gang and that was david's whole
[1:47:18] thing i want to join a gang and that was
[1:47:19] his motivating
[1:47:21] answer and that's what drove him i want
[1:47:22] to join a gang like we're talking like
[1:47:24] big time gangs but vanessa got the
[1:47:27] answer he wants to join a gang we had
[1:47:28] this different things he wants to do but
[1:47:30] that was a definite something in his
[1:47:32] life a demon had said join a gang
[1:47:34] and she picked that answer up the answer
[1:47:36] is he wants to join a gang prayer
[1:47:37] against that thing
[1:47:38] see
[1:47:39] we don't live in a time of confusion we
[1:47:41] live in the time of answers
[1:47:42] and if we believe it and we just receive
[1:47:45] it we can have answers we don't we're
[1:47:47] not confused amen well no i know this
[1:47:49] may not apply but who should i marry
[1:47:51] it's a big question
[1:47:53] should i marry
[1:47:55] the lord can give you the answer the
[1:47:57] lord does give you the answer he's not
[1:47:58] going to give you the wrong answer the
[1:47:59] lord's going to give you the answer yes
[1:48:01] he might say wait
[1:48:02] it's not going to be stab in the dark he
[1:48:04] might say just wait we might say
[1:48:06] this
[1:48:07] but i'm saying it's not don't think it's
[1:48:09] like there's these things out there that
[1:48:11] i just don't know no give it to the lord
[1:48:13] he'll give you an answer
[1:48:15] and i can't tell you who you're going to
[1:48:16] marry like see that's what i'm saying
[1:48:18] this is not a general answer who should
[1:48:19] i marry oh this person it doesn't bother
[1:48:22] to me who you marry so i could say
[1:48:23] anybody oh you'll make a good husband
[1:48:25] she'll make a good wife
[1:48:27] don't listen to me because
[1:48:29] because the consequences are on you you
[1:48:31] know the wrong person it's on you not me
[1:48:33] you know
[1:48:35] if you came to me i'll tell you these
[1:48:36] things okay this is that this this is
[1:48:38] what this is what i'd work within this
[1:48:39] parameter
[1:48:40] but aside from that you're on your own
[1:48:42] man sorry
[1:48:44] but the lord can give you an answer uh
[1:48:47] this is another one where should i live
[1:48:49] why are you all living here
[1:48:51] what you all live in wellington why are
[1:48:53] you here
[1:48:54] do you feel like you're here because
[1:48:55] you're supposed to be here did you get
[1:48:56] dragged here and the laws maybe then
[1:48:57] just twisted and made it work what's the
[1:49:00] like i could tell you i'm here because
[1:49:02] the lord said move here
[1:49:04] move here i didn't have any job when you
[1:49:06] turned up nothing was working and i said
[1:49:07] to like i said it doesn't matter we're
[1:49:09] going to stay here even if i have to
[1:49:11] shovel bricks
[1:49:13] rubble down at a construction site for a
[1:49:15] job i'll do it we're going to stay here
[1:49:16] and it's going to work in the story the
[1:49:18] lord put us here
[1:49:20] you should know that about where you
[1:49:21] live
[1:49:22] like it should be i'm out what piece of
[1:49:24] dirt you stay on matters it matters
[1:49:28] i don't know
[1:49:30] something something in me feels like
[1:49:31] where we live is a godly place i don't
[1:49:33] know it feels like there's a lot of
[1:49:35] churches it feels like there's a there's
[1:49:36] a spiritual atmosphere on it that's
[1:49:38] that's blessed for some
[1:49:40] you won't like it when i say this but it
[1:49:41] feels like here it's not feels like this
[1:49:43] in the heart it feels like yeah i've
[1:49:44] always felt like there's something on it
[1:49:46] i don't know what it is the same i felt
[1:49:47] and um
[1:49:48] now don't take that now that's just my
[1:49:50] thought don't take that as an answer
[1:49:52] that's my opinion
[1:49:54] the same in hawke's bay i thought around
[1:49:55] napier hastings i thought i never liked
[1:49:57] this area there's something eerie about
[1:49:58] it you come to find out there's just
[1:50:00] there's a bad spirit on there like
[1:50:01] there's something on that place and
[1:50:03] there's a lot of evil stuff happens
[1:50:04] there domestic violence and things and
[1:50:07] but up where we are it feels like this
[1:50:10] like this that's open something and it's
[1:50:11] not just naturally but it feels like
[1:50:14] there's a blessing on it some somewhere
[1:50:15] down somewhere at some point someone's
[1:50:17] done something
[1:50:19] and there's something on it just that's
[1:50:20] what it feels like to me i'm like i'm
[1:50:21] happy to be here it feels like i feel my
[1:50:24] spirit connects somehow with with this
[1:50:25] hair there's something on it because
[1:50:27] there are places brother adam said leave
[1:50:28] that place he told brothers leave that
[1:50:30] little town there's judgement on it i'd
[1:50:31] leave it if i was you don't live there
[1:50:33] where we live matters lord where do you
[1:50:35] want me to live
[1:50:36] and if you said to me oh like we said i
[1:50:38] don't mean shall i go and live here well
[1:50:39] what is there a fellowship there for one
[1:50:41] what's there you know
[1:50:43] but true but where you are matters and
[1:50:45] the lord can tell you exactly where you
[1:50:47] should be and you are supposed to be in
[1:50:48] a certain place
[1:50:50] like naomi friesen what's she doing here
[1:50:52] [Laughter]
[1:50:56] are you supposed to be here
[1:50:58] that's good see
[1:51:00] she's got a confidence towards the lord
[1:51:01] i'm supposed to be here she was born
[1:51:03] around the other side of the world
[1:51:05] why is she here
[1:51:07] because the lord brought her here for a
[1:51:09] specific purpose
[1:51:10] it's not just oh i just happened to find
[1:51:13] a ticket my parents said i'd go here and
[1:51:14] i just went you know
[1:51:16] when we're sometimes when we're
[1:51:18] non-believers that happens when we're
[1:51:19] believers we should know no i'm here
[1:51:21] because the lord led me here this is
[1:51:22] where i should be if you don't have that
[1:51:24] i suggest
[1:51:25] you ask the lord and he can tell you
[1:51:27] lord i'm actually supposed to be here we
[1:51:29] just came here when i was not a believer
[1:51:30] for a job but am i supposed to be here
[1:51:33] hope brother being one alive because
[1:51:34] maybe harder people will leave
[1:51:37] don't let
[1:51:39] i believe the lord wants you all here
[1:51:44] for good
[1:51:45] till the rapture
[1:51:52] i have been
[1:51:53] nudging the believers wouldn't it be
[1:51:55] nice to have a church more up the coasts
[1:52:02] [Laughter]
[1:52:04] you know the funny thing is in my spirit
[1:52:06] it feels like oh i wouldn't there was a
[1:52:08] time where i thought no it's not the
[1:52:09] right thing but it's like ah there's not
[1:52:12] put it this way there's not resistance
[1:52:13] to that idea it's like ah and at the
[1:52:15] moment there's actually a rent review
[1:52:16] happening here and things
[1:52:18] [Laughter]
[1:52:20] but there's
[1:52:22] but
[1:52:23] we will know
[1:52:25] that's why i often say to brother ben
[1:52:27] the lord will give you the answer i
[1:52:30] believe it you i'm not going to come
[1:52:32] here and tell you any answers bro the
[1:52:33] lord will give you the answer
[1:52:35] because you are the pastor he's going to
[1:52:36] show you and i've got confidence in that
[1:52:38] you will get shown because that's the
[1:52:40] god that we serve he wants to give us
[1:52:41] answers if we're as disciples he takes
[1:52:42] us away here's the answer
[1:52:44] we don't need to walk and not know walk
[1:52:46] in confusion unless he says just walk on
[1:52:48] you'll find out later on sometimes
[1:52:49] that's the answer
[1:52:51] but that's only but don't just
[1:52:52] sometimes we may just say oh i just
[1:52:54] don't know and i'll just walk on well no
[1:52:56] maybe prod a bit first make sure make
[1:52:58] sure that's the answer you know don't
[1:52:59] just accept that because sometimes that
[1:53:01] can be oh i'll just accept that i'm sick
[1:53:02] and i will
[1:53:04] you know
[1:53:04] just make sure that the
[1:53:06] okay i don't need to know this right now
[1:53:08] is the answer
[1:53:10] uh what church should i go to
[1:53:13] that's a genuine you need to find the
[1:53:15] answer to that because you you need to
[1:53:16] know where you are you're supposed to be
[1:53:18] there
[1:53:18] you can't just go oh just try here try
[1:53:20] the air try there
[1:53:21] when you serve the lord the lord has got
[1:53:23] a specific fellowship that you're
[1:53:25] supposed to be a part of to labor in
[1:53:27] that is the best for your
[1:53:29] your person for what is you
[1:53:31] because all churches are different
[1:53:32] they're all different flavors they're
[1:53:33] different types of different things
[1:53:35] that's just the way it is and the lord
[1:53:37] has
[1:53:38] people in different places for different
[1:53:39] reasons you have to find out where am i
[1:53:41] supposed to be
[1:53:42] you know
[1:53:43] or
[1:53:44] this one what should i do in my
[1:53:46] financial life meaning because we all
[1:53:48] have to do something to get money and
[1:53:49] otherwise we should have to death but
[1:53:51] what should i be doing what what what
[1:53:54] should i be dealing in it you and i look
[1:53:57] around you all are having to do this
[1:53:59] but but where you are currently is it
[1:54:01] what you're supposed to be doing are you
[1:54:02] confident this is exactly what the lord
[1:54:05] wants to be doing exactly
[1:54:07] you have to be confident
[1:54:08] see we live in a time of confidence
[1:54:10] towards the lord lord i know you put me
[1:54:11] in this job and i'm supposed to be here
[1:54:13] for the season then you can go there
[1:54:15] happy and go look i'm here to serve the
[1:54:17] lord i'm here in the name of the lord
[1:54:19] and i'm never going to complain about my
[1:54:21] boss or this or that because i'm here in
[1:54:22] the name of the lord i'm supposed to be
[1:54:24] here i'm not just this is not a filling
[1:54:25] this is where i'm supposed to be
[1:54:27] we can have a confidence toward god
[1:54:29] jenny's supposed to work with us for a
[1:54:31] while
[1:54:32] so jimmy said he's going to work for us
[1:54:33] forever as he said
[1:54:37] oh no no sorry i take that back he said
[1:54:39] he's going to live in wellington forever
[1:54:40] because i said oh you know you might be
[1:54:42] here and then after a while you might
[1:54:43] move on somewhere else just you know
[1:54:44] that's the lord i said i'm happy when
[1:54:46] you come but we're happy when you go you
[1:54:47] just be led by the lord you know it's
[1:54:49] not like oh when you come we're happy
[1:54:50] when you go oh we're all upset no no
[1:54:53] we need to know that people are led by
[1:54:54] the lord like brother james when you go
[1:54:56] praise the lord brother move you this is
[1:54:58] something in me felt good about it like
[1:54:59] yeah you're doing the right thing
[1:55:01] even though we lose you can't that can't
[1:55:03] be your judgment i don't want you to go
[1:55:04] because i'm going to lose right it's got
[1:55:06] to be bigger than that the lord he's got
[1:55:08] to be the lord's answer no i really fell
[1:55:09] in my spirit you're doing the right
[1:55:11] thing
[1:55:11] praise the lord
[1:55:13] so i said that to jimmy he said no no
[1:55:14] i'm going to be in wellington forever
[1:55:16] yeah he said you say that to me hey
[1:55:20] well hold him to it
[1:55:23] uh
[1:55:26] should i take that job
[1:55:28] you ever had a situation where should i
[1:55:29] take the job or not because you've
[1:55:30] got to leave one job start another one
[1:55:32] the lord can give you an answer hey your
[1:55:35] sister priscilla that was that was
[1:55:37] another one too we just said i don't
[1:55:38] know how this is going to work we'll
[1:55:39] just take her on and it's worked out
[1:55:40] really well just
[1:55:42] we don't always do decisions like that
[1:55:44] but i'm doing it more and more lately i
[1:55:45] must admit
[1:55:48] because i'm realizing that you know god
[1:55:50] knows better than any of our financial
[1:55:52] analyzing and planning of a situation
[1:55:54] can amen now people may call me stupid
[1:55:57] but it's like well this works a lot
[1:55:58] better because i serve a god that knows
[1:56:00] what the future holds knows what's going
[1:56:02] to pan out
[1:56:03] that's the god i serve and i'm actually
[1:56:05] these days more confident finding his
[1:56:07] answer even if it doesn't make sense
[1:56:08] with my numbers and everything i'm
[1:56:11] confident doing that answer because then
[1:56:13] i know it's going to be all right if i
[1:56:14] get his answer then we just go with it
[1:56:17] and that's it doesn't have to actually
[1:56:19] it doesn't have to all make sense even
[1:56:22] financially
[1:56:23] if it's his answer just just take his
[1:56:25] answer
[1:56:26] that's because we often think well it's
[1:56:28] got to make sense and i have to be able
[1:56:29] to plan it all out
[1:56:31] well we can get to a place where we can
[1:56:34] the lord's answer makes great financial
[1:56:36] sense because he's the he owns the
[1:56:38] cattle on a thousand hills he's always
[1:56:39] gonna look after us so we can just go on
[1:56:41] his answer
[1:56:42] uh yes sir what about this one should i
[1:56:45] do the certain thing as a hobby
[1:56:47] who's got hobbies
[1:56:49] you know what are they and why do you do
[1:56:51] them and should you be doing it
[1:56:54] see these things they they actually
[1:56:57] matter what do you do when you have your
[1:57:00] you don't have any free time spare time
[1:57:01] but you allocate time
[1:57:03] and you kind of should do something that
[1:57:05] that you know is a bit of a natural
[1:57:06] human thing that you have fun doing and
[1:57:07] it just you know but what i what are you
[1:57:10] doing and is it that do you feel it's
[1:57:12] the right thing for you to do
[1:57:14] like my hobbies i think yeah my hobbies
[1:57:16] i feel good about them i feel before the
[1:57:18] lord yes i'm happy doing this but we may
[1:57:20] be doing hobbies that the lord says that
[1:57:22] you're wasting your time
[1:57:23] you shouldn't be doing that nonsense
[1:57:25] but because we want to do it we don't
[1:57:26] ask the question
[1:57:28] you know because we want to do it so we
[1:57:30] don't ask
[1:57:31] but
[1:57:33] these things matter
[1:57:35] this might be funny but should i drink
[1:57:37] coffee
[1:57:45] all right
[1:57:47] you shouldn't drink v no no no no is
[1:57:50] this the
[1:57:51] v
[1:57:53] that's a good question
[1:57:55] it is actually because you know
[1:57:57] everything kind of ruins you to a small
[1:57:58] degree but some things ruin you a lot
[1:58:00] and so therefore we say we won't take
[1:58:02] that like certain
[1:58:04] uh things we can put in our body affect
[1:58:07] us really bad
[1:58:09] and then other things not as much and
[1:58:10] coffee is like yeah kind of you do the
[1:58:12] research oh it's just sort of flavor in
[1:58:14] moderation it doesn't really do too much
[1:58:15] damage to me it's sort of like
[1:58:17] you know about the same as a lollywood
[1:58:19] but you shouldn't have lost sweet too
[1:58:20] much sugar either
[1:58:22] um
[1:58:23] well
[1:58:26] i was going to say something there that
[1:58:27] was about um
[1:58:29] i've lost my maybe when i said it was i
[1:58:31] think it was about coffee
[1:58:33] but i'm not saying to not drink coffee
[1:58:34] don't get me wrong what i'm saying there
[1:58:35] are answers but but i could drink it
[1:58:38] there's there are some things that like
[1:58:39] i think coffee could be a relative one
[1:58:41] like
[1:58:42] because there are general things that we
[1:58:44] shouldn't do but there are other things
[1:58:45] that maybe it's all right for me like
[1:58:46] maybe my hobby is it shouldn't be your
[1:58:47] hobby
[1:58:48] or maybe if i drink coffee shouldn't be
[1:58:50] yours you can't come to me should i
[1:58:51] drink coffee i'm like yeah brother i
[1:58:52] drink it all the time it's the most
[1:58:54] wonderful drink in the world well i'm
[1:58:55] not the right guy to ask because i like
[1:58:57] it you see so be careful who you ask
[1:58:59] what you get advice from but you should
[1:59:00] know these things you should know am i
[1:59:03] doing this too much because the lord's
[1:59:04] got an answer for this
[1:59:06] he won't say no you're actually doing
[1:59:07] six cups of days too much and it's
[1:59:09] affecting your nervous system it's
[1:59:10] affecting how you think you're not
[1:59:11] sleeping as well as a result you're
[1:59:13] waking up a bit strong you know one of
[1:59:15] the things we need to get answers from
[1:59:16] the law is to be relaxed
[1:59:18] and the way to be relaxed is put the
[1:59:19] right food in your body get your body
[1:59:21] relaxed make it don't make it all tense
[1:59:23] have it relaxed so if you're plugging
[1:59:25] stuff in your body like v-drinks that
[1:59:26] are working up your mind too much and
[1:59:27] just making you making your edgy it's
[1:59:30] going to affect your mental capacity
[1:59:32] it's going to and then it's going to
[1:59:33] affect your connection with your spirit
[1:59:34] you're going to be
[1:59:35] a bit nervous
[1:59:36] and if you get like that you think you
[1:59:38] should think okay i need to maybe maybe
[1:59:40] if you ask the lord he might say stop
[1:59:41] doing that and you'll find that we'll
[1:59:42] have a result and make you more relaxed
[1:59:45] just i'm just saying
[1:59:49] i'm just i've almost i'm wrapping this
[1:59:51] up now
[1:59:53] these are just this you have these other
[1:59:54] questions that don't really matter like
[1:59:55] these other ones you're actually you
[1:59:57] know you're sipping on your coffee
[1:59:58] thinking should i do it should i not the
[1:59:59] answer matters you know because when you
[2:00:01] make the next one your conscience may
[2:00:02] kick in i shouldn't do it i'm just
[2:00:03] saying they matter but these there are
[2:00:05] questions that don't really matter
[2:00:07] and these we just you know like why did
[2:00:09] paul shave his head
[2:00:11] it's a new there are unusual things in
[2:00:12] the bible that we why you think no
[2:00:14] that's an unusual thing i know brother
[2:00:16] brown said to him another man thought
[2:00:17] that it was strange or something that he
[2:00:19] did and he almost thought it was a wrong
[2:00:21] thing to do or something and brother
[2:00:22] branham said to me and by the way before
[2:00:24] there was a good reason why paul shaved
[2:00:25] his head i'd like to know why he shaved
[2:00:27] his head what was the reason for that
[2:00:28] some things i just think like this i
[2:00:30] often it intrigues me about the stuff
[2:00:32] like systems they've put up i think
[2:00:34] what was the intent behind this like the
[2:00:36] federal reserve these financial systems
[2:00:37] was it evil intent all these guys just
[2:00:39] trying to make a quick buck or what was
[2:00:40] the little
[2:00:41] you know it could go either way or 9 11
[2:00:43] stuff it's like your research you're
[2:00:44] like what's going on here last thing i
[2:00:46] don't really care but i think on the dad
[2:00:48] judgment i'd like to know these answers
[2:00:49] what happened there
[2:00:51] show me show me people's thoughts what
[2:00:53] did he think
[2:00:54] what did they think what did they do
[2:00:56] because all the answers are going to be
[2:00:57] laid out so some things i just think the
[2:00:59] answer doesn't matter so we don't need
[2:01:00] to get too worked up over it
[2:01:02] now the last one i'm going to cover is
[2:01:03] why something like it is in your life
[2:01:06] some things are just a certain way and i
[2:01:08] think you need to know why like
[2:01:11] you you need to know you should know
[2:01:13] where you're at in your life and what
[2:01:14] what is going on in your life for the
[2:01:16] direction the season
[2:01:17] you may not work in seasons but there
[2:01:19] are seasons
[2:01:20] you can't don't watch this and think oh
[2:01:22] look i better pick my season
[2:01:25] it may be relative to you it may not but
[2:01:27] but life does go in seasons things go
[2:01:31] and the lord told me this is going to be
[2:01:32] your season and it's going to come like
[2:01:34] this now because the world works in
[2:01:35] seasons oftentimes the lord does have a
[2:01:37] certain season but we can't always think
[2:01:40] like that too much because then you
[2:01:41] could say oh well a church will be okay
[2:01:42] for a while then it will go into a
[2:01:44] winter season and be no good no no it
[2:01:46] can be in a permanent uh we live in the
[2:01:48] uh on the equator you know we're just
[2:01:50] always sun shining you know
[2:01:51] so don't don't apply this to everything
[2:01:53] but
[2:01:54] you could be going through something you
[2:01:55] think why is nothing working why is it
[2:01:57] all this is just everything i work try
[2:01:58] doesn't work it's just everything's hard
[2:02:00] it could just be a winter
[2:02:02] ask the lord about it maybe it's just a
[2:02:04] season he's bringing you through maybe
[2:02:05] you don't need to do anything maybe
[2:02:06] you've done nothing wrong it's just a
[2:02:08] season just but you should know that you
[2:02:10] should know if you're in that this is
[2:02:11] what i'm in
[2:02:13] or like and brother branham said day and
[2:02:15] night he said sometimes in a family you
[2:02:16] know they might have just go through a
[2:02:17] hard time he said they're just going
[2:02:18] through a night time and as a family
[2:02:20] then they come out the dawn breaks they
[2:02:22] come out to a day time
[2:02:23] it may but then it may be something and
[2:02:25] that that there's a
[2:02:27] problem that's something you've done
[2:02:28] something something's happened to make
[2:02:29] the family
[2:02:31] like that
[2:02:33] like my the lord's often spoken to me
[2:02:35] through kings and said that
[2:02:37] the different kings in the bible and
[2:02:39] said this is you're going to be like
[2:02:40] this king for a while and you're going
[2:02:41] to have this
[2:02:42] that your life will be like his one and
[2:02:45] it was like one of them
[2:02:46] they've been quite a few one of them was
[2:02:48] david and solomon he said you'll have a
[2:02:50] time of david where you'll have to fight
[2:02:51] fight fight all the time then you'll
[2:02:53] have a time where where a sun came on
[2:02:55] it's a time of peace and when that comes
[2:02:57] you won't have to spend your time
[2:02:58] fighting you'll be able to spend the
[2:02:59] energy doing what
[2:03:01] you've been called to do like in the
[2:03:02] solomon's case it was build the temple
[2:03:04] but david spent so much time fighting
[2:03:06] he didn't have the time for it but then
[2:03:07] the lord also said don't do it but all
[2:03:10] his resources were going to fight
[2:03:11] battles
[2:03:12] but solomon had no battles so then the
[2:03:14] resources he would have spent fighting
[2:03:15] enemies he could then build up and build
[2:03:17] the temple but the lord says this is
[2:03:19] what your life's going to be it's going
[2:03:20] to be like this for a season then it
[2:03:21] will change and when the season of
[2:03:22] solomon comes it will be like this
[2:03:24] so it's not confusing and you think okay
[2:03:25] this is where it's going to be now it's
[2:03:26] just going to unfold like this and it's
[2:03:28] happening that same way
[2:03:30] i want to read you this last quote
[2:03:31] this is now more in a negative way but
[2:03:33] you need to apply this to your life as
[2:03:34] well
[2:03:35] to to
[2:03:36] to sometimes when you're wondering you
[2:03:38] can't leave any stone unturned you've
[2:03:39] got to look you've got to dig deep in
[2:03:40] the lord can give you an answer many
[2:03:42] times dealing with spiritual things you
[2:03:43] see them when they move out someone was
[2:03:45] just asking me here not long ago i was
[2:03:47] at calgary canada and the boy came in
[2:03:49] they had him in a straight jacket and
[2:03:51] they come in the back of the room and he
[2:03:52] was cursing and carrying on and i never
[2:03:55] heard such a thing in my life
[2:03:57] and the father was trying to hold him
[2:03:59] and when he got on the inside he looked
[2:04:01] over to me and said
[2:04:03] william branham you ain't got nothing to
[2:04:04] do with me this was the boy that was
[2:04:06] possessed by this spirit i believe this
[2:04:08] was it sounds like it was actually in in
[2:04:10] a church setting like this and this guy
[2:04:11] was swearing and cursing and carrying on
[2:04:13] a real commotion
[2:04:15] and then the father looked up and said
[2:04:16] he didn't even know his own name
[2:04:19] how did he know your name because it's a
[2:04:20] spirit
[2:04:22] i was standing off a great distance from
[2:04:24] him oh how he was
[2:04:25] cursing me and carrying on
[2:04:27] and he said you ain't got nothing to do
[2:04:29] with me and i asked the audience if
[2:04:31] there'd just be reverend so i was in
[2:04:32] front of an audience and this this guy
[2:04:34] was swearing in church and all that sort
[2:04:35] of stuff
[2:04:36] if there'd just be reverent the ushers
[2:04:38] came out to take him away
[2:04:41] just then i seen the holy spirit move
[2:04:42] out the angel of the lord the answer
[2:04:45] started to come
[2:04:46] i said now bring him here just a minute
[2:04:48] when they went to bring him he started
[2:04:50] kicking and frothing and biting he was a
[2:04:52] he was in a straitjacket and they
[2:04:53] brought him up close
[2:04:56] to where i was
[2:04:57] and then when the vision came and told
[2:04:59] just what it was
[2:05:01] a sin that had been committed by his
[2:05:02] father that caused the child to be in
[2:05:04] that condition and the father fell down
[2:05:06] and repented
[2:05:11] so
[2:05:12] that was probably not the answer the
[2:05:13] father was looking for no
[2:05:15] because he was saying just cast this
[2:05:17] devil out
[2:05:18] but that was the answer
[2:05:20] now i don't think he knew that was the
[2:05:22] answer
[2:05:23] otherwise he probably would have done it
[2:05:24] already yeah
[2:05:26] but the lord can give us even these
[2:05:27] answers lord what's that answer and
[2:05:29] we've got to be reverent enough before
[2:05:31] the lord and this
[2:05:32] it says here the father
[2:05:34] fell down and repented
[2:05:36] he said was it me
[2:05:38] if that's the answer i accept it forgive
[2:05:40] me
[2:05:41] see
[2:05:42] the intention of the answer was that
[2:05:44] everyone will be made free don't forget
[2:05:45] that the intention of the answer from
[2:05:47] the lord is always it's not to expose
[2:05:49] the father haha because you did this it
[2:05:51] was to make the situation to get rid of
[2:05:53] that devil that was the answer in the
[2:05:55] situation amen but this was the answer
[2:05:58] and then that spirit
[2:05:59] then and when and then when that evil
[2:06:01] stroke went from the boy thousands and
[2:06:02] thousands of people in the stampede
[2:06:04] grounds there that night looked
[2:06:06] he said it looked like a great big
[2:06:08] spider and a black shadow floating
[2:06:10] around on why it was really quite and it
[2:06:12] went around out of the place
[2:06:14] like the spirit that was on the boy just
[2:06:16] went out
[2:06:18] and it went out out of the place out
[2:06:20] through the building it went many times
[2:06:22] you see them in different forms here
[2:06:23] recently i seen one coming from a woman
[2:06:25] and it looked like a bat with great big
[2:06:26] hairs hanging under its legs and so
[2:06:28] forth its swings come right out right
[2:06:30] straight up these are wrong answers
[2:06:34] that's why i say at the start i said
[2:06:35] this is demonic these things
[2:06:37] wrong answers have demons writing on
[2:06:39] them and they're just nothing but demons
[2:06:40] like that that woman we
[2:06:42] had in the picture she's got demons on
[2:06:44] her
[2:06:44] that look like this this is how serious
[2:06:46] this stuff is we need the right answer
[2:06:48] we if we entertain these wrong answers
[2:06:50] and take them on board there's spirits
[2:06:51] on those things because we it opens up
[2:06:53] something in our mind and we let it in
[2:06:55] we don't want any of this nonsense man
[2:06:57] out of it the evil spirit so many times
[2:06:59] it's someone looking ever so beautiful
[2:07:01] on the outside if you could only look on
[2:07:02] the inside and see what it is we're
[2:07:04] dominated by a spirit
[2:07:06] i don't believe we have that here and i
[2:07:08] believe
[2:07:09] that
[2:07:10] that when we really accept christ the
[2:07:12] spirit of god does deal with a lot of
[2:07:14] spirits in us unbeknownst to us it just
[2:07:16] comes in and it just
[2:07:18] cleans it out you know when we receive
[2:07:20] the holy ghost just because i we we
[2:07:22] don't need to i think if the lord can
[2:07:24] show us we don't need to be scared
[2:07:27] but then i think we should be reverent
[2:07:29] enough to say lord
[2:07:31] search me and i i want i want if there's
[2:07:33] anything like that lord if if my life is
[2:07:35] a certain way because of something could
[2:07:36] you show me yeah and he's got the
[2:07:37] ability to show us what if
[2:07:41] if it is something like that that man
[2:07:42] there got he got his answer
[2:07:45] i reckon he was happy
[2:07:46] even though it showed he was doing
[2:07:48] something wrong he was happy praise the
[2:07:49] lord he'd even testify president i'd
[2:07:51] done this this happened that's happened
[2:07:53] then the lord revealed it now i'm free
[2:07:55] because at the end of the day we're free
[2:07:56] who cares amen i'd rather i'd rather be
[2:07:59] a bit embarrassed for a short time but
[2:08:00] be free
[2:08:01] then then take something to the grave we
[2:08:03] don't want to take these things to the
[2:08:04] grave and
[2:08:06] and live now this man could probably
[2:08:08] these both these people could have been
[2:08:10] saved on their way to heaven but it can
[2:08:12] affect their natural life yeah because
[2:08:14] that can happen we these things can just
[2:08:16] affect the capacity that we can operate
[2:08:17] here
[2:08:18] these things they they they we can have
[2:08:20] something honest that just affects how
[2:08:21] we operate like complex we're still
[2:08:23] saved it just affects how we operate
[2:08:27] matthews says ask and it shall be given
[2:08:29] you seek and you shall find knock and it
[2:08:30] shall be open to you
[2:08:33] that was all i had this morning
[2:08:36] but my message from the lord for you is
