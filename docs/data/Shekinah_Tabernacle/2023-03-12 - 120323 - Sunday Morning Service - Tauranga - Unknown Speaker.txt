========================================

uh yeah we just welcome our visitors this morning um there is a potluck after church today at brother Albert Junior's place um that's at I believe it's 2C the urban road is that right um if anybody's lost anything uh see brother Chris circle after the service that was at the wedding if anybody lost anything at the wedding [Music] um and we have our brother Ben loin ministering this morning so we're just trusting and believing for refreshing from the presence of the Lord this morning that our brother will be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen now let's just pray and Commit This Time to the Lord our heavenly father we deem this a great privilege to be in your presence this morning and as the musicians will play their instruments we feel your presence oh God and Lord we we don't underestimate the power of music we know through the power of music demons can be cast out and we appreciate the guests within the body this morning whether it be musicians or uh the ministers as flaming fires or God we we just pray that your Holy Spirit would come and Lord anoint the service this morning oh God help us to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and no doubt there is great needs amongst us and we just pray that you give our brother Ben the ability to you have to step aside this morning that your Holy Spirit may be able to come down and Lord break the chains of bondage that would be holding us back from entering into the complete Liberty of Jesus Christ Lord for we know that that is what you have for us as Liberty and freedom or God and I just pray for a freedom of worship this morning oh God more so as we enter into the ministering of the word I pray I just pray there'd be a spontaneous time of worship and receiving of the word of God we do Commit This Time to you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's all stand and let's put on the screen we bring a sacrifice of praise um we bring a sacrifice of praise and to the house let's sacrifice is Thanksgiving we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house foreign the sacrifice is going from the top we bring sacrifice of praise into the house all around me the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and we offer sacrifice hey man let's sing another one here I have a message from the Lord [Music] right and we have a technical glitch here we go we've got it [Music] man I've a message from the Lord I'll give you it's recorded in his words Hallelujah it is today look and live my brothers look and live my brother lives look to Jesus foreign amen we thank the Lord that the gospel message is so simple just look to Jesus and live amen I thirsted in a Barren land let's sing this one this morning [Music] hi thirsted in a Barren land of sin and shame and nothing satisfying there I found the Blessed Cross of Christ a wonderful and beautiful have Glory Grace and blessing Mark the path of trouble I'm shouting Hallelujah every day a thousand there is looking at the Springs of Living Waters amen praise the Lord now you may be seated this morning I was just wondering does anybody have a testimony this morning for the glory of God maybe something the Lord's been doing in your life no takers I can maybe break the ice a little bit um I just want to thank the Lord that he continues to give opportunity to witness and I have had some opportunities recently to witness to a number of people about the coming of the Lord um and it's it's been really encouraging for me it's it's almost like a Drogo I just want to find more people to share the word of God with because this world is heading for an absolute train wreck and the only answer is the coming of the Lord and I mean you have to use a bit of a discernment of course but if you really kind of fall into that channel and you find hearts that are willing it can be life-changing you may not see it straight away but when I've shared the word they've received it and we don't know what might happen to that person but the word of God's a seed Saints and we just trust it if I was in the good ground so I just want to thank the Lord for that I think we have an obligation to tell people because there's an oncoming judgment and there's there's a shaking coming like that's going to make turkey and some of these great earthquakes look like nothing and I think sometimes we need to shake ourselves and and realize one of these days 1400 miles of coastline is going to sink and and we don't want to I don't want to see my friends my family my associates go through that and I don't want to see people you know the dad comes to me and say why don't you tell me I I think we we need to warn people and and tell them he's coming amen he's coming real soon so we just praise the Lord for the message of the hour that's that's warned us about these things amen so I hope I've inspired somebody maybe not does um does anybody have any prayer requests this morning spoken or unspoken yeah one of my some of our friends a woman's name is Candice and she's very sick with something shaking the whole body is shaking for the past 12 months and the doctors are getting no hope and it looks like that could just get worse until she dies right and I told him that I'll play for it oh that we'll pray for her sure the Lord is the only hope yeah okay we're certainly remember Candace this morning um so is it unspoken or [Music] sure sure anybody else this morning nobody else okay let's just Commit This to the Lord our heavenly father we thank you that we can come to the all-sufficient God Lord you are the fountain that never dries or Runs Out Lord you

number one the devil but you know all these things too so anyway praise a lot so uh Mark 4 and 35 it says uh and the same day uh then when even was come he saith unto them let us pass over onto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and they say unto him Master Keras not thou that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and set unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they exceed and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him amen and then we're just going to read uh just the next verse here in um chapter five and they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of the Gatherings amen let's just bow here's the word of prayer this morning if you ever need you just want to raise your hand to the Lord you

with brother Albert sister Brahman down South May bless them and use them mildly for your kingdom down there Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless your friends you may have your seats uh this morning and I want to I want to speak about I want to pose a question and and we know the answer to this question but I want to ask the question can there be another revival can there be another Revival you know we find ourselves uh you know brother Brandon would identify where we are currently as as the disciples here on the way from from one side of the Sea of Galilee to the other to the to the to the country of the gadarines now on the Gatherings there was we know there were tombs there there was not just a Maniac in the Tomb but there was there was the there was the dead there and and you know we understand that we're traveling you know our our journey will ultimately take us to the dead in Christ will race right so we're on a journey in a ship Jesus is in your ship I trust he's in your ship today and if he's not you can call him on the scene and he'll come into your ship you know it's amazing how the very one that can save us is the very one we're afraid of right you know there's another account in the gospels where where Jesus sent them you know to to travel in their ship to you know the other side of the lake and he and he waited on the other side and that night when they were trying to row and they were rowing against the window weren't getting anywhere and they saw him and they thought he was a spirit on the water and the Very one that could help them in their ship they were afraid of and they're very worried that God has sent in this age people are afraid of because it's the Lord Jesus Christ and it's amazing when you look at the first time fear ever gripped man was in the Garden of Eden after the fall Adam never knew what it was like to be afraid until he heard that voice he heard the voice of God walking in the garden and they tried to cover their sin with the Fig leaves and you know the story about the first time fear man ever felt fear was when his God came to have fellowship with him but because of sin I mean they were afraid of him but we shouldn't be afraid of him this morning he's here to come into our storm he's here to come you know I'm so thankful we can awaken him in our boat he may be asleep but if he's in your ship you can awaken him and if he's but if he's not in your ship he's walking on the water of your life to come and step into your boat but you've got to invite him in I mean so so we're much like the disciples where they would they would be you know brother Brown would dramatize it and he would speak about how how when he was asleep in the back of the ship the disciples as they were rowing the boat they would they would begin to talk and testify of what they had just seen the Living God do and you know they would they would get up one after the other and say you know I can't you know it's so amazing to see that crippled man just get up and how he took the Bro bread and the fish you know break it and feed the people and you know then maybe John would get up and give a testimony and Peter would interrupt and give his testimony and tell everyone to be quiet and you know you're because they were feasting on the results of a great Revival that they just had and brother Brahm says in calling Jesus on the scene this is this is a 19th 63 he says he says that something like us today those disciples out there on that ship that night after the Revival they were feasting on the results now maybe between revivals now we're looking for another stir where there's got to be something happen now that will gather the church together there's got to be some kind of a press God always does it that way to run as people together I believe it's already being formed that will shut out everything that won't agree with them and then it's going to be run the church together and we're waiting for that to happen and we're living on the results of the great Revival that we've just passed and he is resting now remember Christ was in the ship with them the word was there with them so so we have we're not looking for God to open his word further we don't need an eighth messenger the seventh has come the mystery of God is finished right so we're not looking for another Prophet to come on the scene and open the scripture it's already happened just like Christ they weren't looking for Christ to come he was already in the boat amen so but but he must be awakened now now we are living off the the result adults were facing off the receipt um we're facing on the results of Revival yeah even even if we you know we go back 50 years The World Is Still feasting off the results of the post World War II healing Revival where that swept the world and churches were birthed and people came into the kingdom the power of God was poured out brother Brahm initiated that Revival history tells us but then we can even come forward to when the message came into this country there was a great Revival that swept the country right and then you can even bring it down to your life when he met you there was a Revival you were awakened you're Once Dead and trespasses and sins thinking you're from New Zealand or from some country but then when he came your way and opened your eyes you realize I'm actually a son or daughter of God I came from God and I'm going back to God you had a Revival because a Revival means an Awakening it means I've trust you've been awakened to the fact you're not this you know child of your parents you're a son or daughter of God Amen because when you are awakened you begin you begin to live different you begin to act different because you realize who your parent really is what your main not this not this body but your soul I mean it came from God it's going back to God so they can be a mighty Revival who had that guy I trust you had that kind of time in your Christian walk where God became alive you saw a little you know it wasn't a just just an intellectual Revival because the thing is the disciples no doubt they begin to talk about the you know because it wasn't just the Miracles they would have talked about but what Jesus was teaching and they began to discuss The Parables back and forth and it's amazing when you get men together and they look forget who's with them they begin to have disagreements one with the other and no doubt they were rowing and you know when you're rowing a boat you need to all be rowing in unison otherwise you start going in circles whoever tried to roll a boat well even yourself you've got to have the ores together you can't go like this otherwise you start going like this right and you know so so they had to be rowing in unison but you know no doubt you know maybe one of the disciples said something about a parable and maybe Peter because you know Peter was always quick on the trigger you say brother I just don't see it that way you know I don't believe Jesus put that emphasis on that quote like that and you know I just you know I you know I think you're barking up the wrong tree and I don't agree with this kind of Doctrine and maybe he got us all out maybe maybe splash the disciple with the oil you know that he was disagreeing with them you know what happened a fuss in a fight started them in the boat and this is sadly what has happened down from since the prophet's been here down into this day people have risen up there's been eighth Messengers specialty doctrines whatever you've got to listen to certain preachers to go on the Rapture all kind of nonsense you know and what's happened it's caused a fuss and a fight in the bride of Christ and people have picked up their rules and and and and their focus is not getting to the other side to bring a resurrection amen of the of the Dead Saints their whole focus is using their or or the quotes and the scriptures that are together as a weapon to try and take out the others I pray none of us are in this boat or in that category right but you know this is sadly what has happened the disciples took their Vision off the master said we've got to go to the other side he said let's go to the other side there's a reason why the Lord wanted them to go there because we know the maniac was in the Tomb right and there's a reason why God has us on our path is because the dead in Christ must rise we've got to get to a certain part of our journey then they're going to come out of the grave and we're going to be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air that's our Focus that's our goal right the grave is not our goal the sky is our goal amen so that should be our focus and everything we do like brother MSM was saying testifying to family is bird no God bless your Zeal brother Emerson amen so I really appreciated that you know why because he sees the goal the judgment's coming but there's always a way God always gives a way of Escape before the Judgment strikes you know just like Jesus would tell the Disciples of Matthew 24 he says when you see armies can pass around Jerusalem basically Flee for Your Life you know don't even get your stuff just just run and he was prophesying of when Titus would come and surround the city because he knew he was going to be rejected he knew he's going to be crucified and he knew judgment was going to come upon Jerusalem because they rejected the word the Messiah and so so he told them when you see these things flee and so now the believer now wasn't caught up in the politics and the religious nonsense going on in the day they held on to the words of life and then when G then when they saw the Romans come around they weren't caught up with the zealots and this Pharisees and all those guys who are trying to make a religious political move to to renew the nation they held on to the words of the Messiah and when they saw the Romans surround Jerusalem they ran for their life and history apparently says it not one true Christian was caught we're caught in Jerusalem when Titus came in a massacred the place why because they held on to the words of the Lord but the lord gave a way of Escape he said there's a judgment coming but I'm giving you a warning that you can flee you have a place of safety to go to and I'm so thankful we have a place of safety right now and it's not a hill up you know it's not the mountain it's not some Hill up here somewhere but as Jesus Christ himself is our place of safety that we can go to and it's whosoever will you you can go in amen it doesn't matter what state you're in or where you've been or what you've done or what you've said or what life you've lived that's irrelevant amen there is a place of safety you can go to this morning amen I'm so thankful when Jesus gave the parable of the wedding supper he said get the good and the bad get the lame get the Hulk get the get the even if they can't just just pack them in yeah BCS get the good and the bad so I'm glad I'm so thankful when he said the bad it means I I could come amen hallelujah I have a place in there I you know I can get in the door Hallelujah and what I love about it is in the old um you know Jewish custom it didn't matter if you're the richest person in the world or the poorest person in the world a homeless person when you when you came through the door your feet were washed you're Anointed with oil your um your perfume and so on you're made welcome and you're given a new robe so after you've walked through the door everyone looked the same you could have you could be Elon Musk or you could be someone who's homeless but you'd be wearing the same kind of rope you'd look exactly the same on the outside because you've come through the door it's the same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ when you repent to baptize the name of Jesus Christ for mission of sin you receive the Holy Ghost you put on that robe Hallelujah you look all the same we look all the same Amy but there's a way of Escape now here they were they were they were arguing and fussing there in the boat and they did not realize that storm a storm was coming now I don't know if any of you maybe brother Emerson has and anyone else who loves to be on the water but you know being who's ever been caught in a storm on the ocean all right well the martu has is a few here you know it's it's it's amazing when it catches your unawares you know I remember one time this is when my parents they lived in Papua New Guinea and I was I was there in the Christmas season and in the Christmas season over there they have a monsoon season so they don't have winter they have they have monster sooner or or dry season now in the monsoon season it can be very Dead Calm and then gusts will come and it'll start blowing like a gale they'll just start pouring down with rain and I was sailing at catamaran which is a two-man boat and it was just me myself and actually when you sell it you meant to wear a harness to lean out you actually literally only your toes are actually in the boat when you're sailing it but I didn't have a harness I didn't have a crew man I was just myself in a boat which was for two and then I was sailing in the bay it was all I did look nice and then a gust came and then another gust came and then the gusts got closer together I didn't heed the warning see warnings were coming this this the monsoon rain is coming you better get into Shore I didn't heed the warning I was just enjoying the sunshine thinking life is just going to go on as it always has right but then suddenly the gusts came together and just a big one came and then the boat was capsized I couldn't get it back up and I had to wait for the thing actually to be pushed onto the shore to get it back up and get get to safety now the reason I say that is because if I really knew what I was doing I'd realize the first gas would come because I knew where I was I was in monsoon season I was in the tropics I was sailing a boat racks you need two people but I thought I can do it myself and how many people think in this world they can live they can they can sell life solemn Maine by themselves I can do it I know what I'm doing I've done this before I'm a professional just like the disciples they lived they would have cut their teeth on the on the on the rail of the boat of their parents boat of their dad's fishing ship they knew exactly what it was like to be on the Sea of Galilee they knew all how the weather was they knew exactly they knew that sea like the back of their hand so it's amazing how you know the storm began to grow began to brew and then they begin to think we can handle this we can handle the storm we can we can handle this thing sure they were fussing and fighting and but you know when storms begin to come it it changes our Focus yeah I trust it should stay change your focus yo there's got to be a change Among Us I'm talking about myself especially we can't just plow on as we always have there's a change in season here right now amen where it's time to stop hitting each other with oars don't fortify ourselves anymore with quotes and scriptures and just stay there like a bunker you know bunkers are dingy places I've been in you know where my parents were the Japanese had their headquarters for World War II and I've been in so Admiral Yamamoto was the leader of the Japanese forces there in that part of the Pacific I've been in it in his bunker it's dingy it's low ceiling it's not a nice place to live but because of Warren things they had to build the bunker But but so don't build a bunker out of quotes and scriptures and say this is my position this is how I'm going to be always put a comma after what you believe and keep walking see God doesn't want us in a bunker thinking I'm fine and I'm just going to hide away from things going on and these people are doing this and this trouble forget all that stuff God wants us to walk in his Green Green Pastures besides Still Waters Hallelujah amen so so here they were the storm began to brew now brother man says yo as I said we're we are looking for another stir now we understand that this is not a this is not more of his word to open you know brother bear has come Malachi 4 has come to reveal the mystery of God it's finished right the word has come but now we know that a Revival a true Revival now if we look at revivals in the past it was always a company with great power of God it was never just an intellectual Revival it wasn't just a putting the quotes and scriptures together just right there was always power behind it I mean even John Wesley when he would he would preach the second work of Grace about sanctification how God how how we should live a holy life you know there was power in his preaching people will be slain in the spirit in the thousands you know he he would he would write I don't know how many miles a year preaching around England on a horse and his horse one day would stumble and break its leg he anointed it with oil prayed for it according to the scripture got up got back on the horse and kept writing and God would do many mighty things and you know it wasn't just with you know in his ministry but down through God you see see God's Doctrine is always accompanied with power as as we speak of the Lord Jesus Luke 4 and 32 he says and they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power see it wasn't just an empty argument that sounded right it wasn't just a reasonable discussion but there was power there was a company with the word and it should be the same thing with you and I that this bride's Revival that we're currently in I mean because the Thunders have uttered your God has opened his word he's awakened his bride Amen to the power and the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ and so now the bride's Revival is not an intellectual Revival of just realizing what the prophet messenger told us and putting quotes together now that is what Bible schools have been doing for Generations they have taken scriptures they've made their stand they've made schools they've made disciples that have just learned what they've been taught but there's been no power in it but we live in a season where it's meant to be a Breaking of that kind of a cycle where it's not just learning the Bible or learning the message those things are good we should study it please don't quit studying just because I'm saying this don't give me wrong we should study it we should memorize it we should comprehend it we should absorb it amen but it's got to be more than just something learned it must be lived where God takes those quotes and those scriptures and anoints them to our lives and makes it live amen because remember it's not just it's not just an argument that we have we don't just have an argument Christianity is not an argument Christianity is a life is a life of the Lord Jesus Christ coming into you and changing your life amen see the problem is these disciples thought they could sail that storm by themselves and that's what Christians especially you know the worst kind of devil is a religious devil because it can reason so much with the truth it can use quotes and scriptures to defend itself amen but I trust we can never defend sin in our lives using quotes and scriptures you know we should never ever be a human shield to the enemy like that amen if there's something wrong in our lives we should just be honest with God because God knows it anyway and say Lord change me I can't change myself and we can't change ourselves anyway we must be surrendered vessels to almighty God that he can moles and shape us into his very image and you're glad where his workmanship he's still working on me well then how do you know when you're going to be completed when this body's changed Hallelujah so until that I'm on the wheel but mold me Lord don't leave me on the Shelf to get dry and crusty and hard and cracking now be wet with your with your spirit anointed amen molded in shape with the Master's Hand Hallelujah that's how I want to be now we just think about it now I just want to pose this question now just think what if the Holy Ghost had everyone here completely in his control just just in these four walls right now what if the Holy Ghost had everybody in here completely in his control just think of what would take place tonight this brother but I'm saying and just once more Lord just think of what would take place in Shreveport or say in Tauranga by this time tomorrow night there would be headlines ever a bunch of people went crazy they were Healing The Sick they were raising the dead they're doing all kinds of things down in Shreveport Louisiana United States USA that have it on television of what was doing if the Holy Ghost could take completely control why don't he he wants to he's willing to he is waiting well you say I've asked them so many times I just hate to ask him too much ask abundantly that your Joys might be full amen I'm so thankful there's not a ceiling we can put on our God Amen he he is the unlimited God he's Unlimited in potential Unlimited in power and but he wants you pardon me to call him on the scene this morning Hallelujah so what would he do in Tauranga right now I mean if he had us all completely under his control amen that we stop whacking each other with our oars stop splashing each other with our arguments and our well I don't agree with you on whatever put down our oars that way and awaken the master this morning amen he could step on the scene and calm the storm that's going on aiming to get us to the other side because he's willing to but he is waiting see Jesus knew the storm would come he wasn't surprised he knew the maniac was there and you know in the tombs he saw it by Vision he says the son can do nothing till the father shows him and what the father does he does likewise that he was led by Vision amen so he was led by Vision so he saw the storm would come he knew what the disciples would even do Hallelujah but I'm so thankful they came to a point where they actually came to their right mind and awakened the master don't you care Lord that we're going to perish Hallelujah he knew they wouldn't perish because he knew that he had to get to Calvary and go to the go down to Hell take the keys off hell death and the graveyard Satan and the Ascend and be trumpet so he knew that his Earthly Journey wasn't going to end in that sea and you're going to realize whatever trial you're in right now that's not the end of your Earthly Journey amen but you've got glory to go to you've got streets of gold to dance upon Hallelujah you've got a wedding supper to attend amen you've got a reservation at the table I trust God has revealed that to you amen so this is not the end of your journey amen but I'm so thankful that trials actually are made that that it will release the power of God to us there are many times we think Charles and hardship are uh uh you could say a curse or no they're actually a blessing where trials are built actually to not just release the power of God to us but to free us of trouble now we look at the you know um Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were Bounder you know they were bound they're under a great trial there that a lot of pressure was upon them to bow to the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar set up and say that they were bound and they were thrown into the furnace now to me you know I mean I mean the reason we we often think of them is because they didn't get burnt up in the fire but I believe they'd still be perfectly good Believers and good to refer to their testimony if they got burned up and the fire never came out because they said if God's willing to save us praise God if not we're still not going to Bow and to me that is that is truly the heart of a real believer but you see the thing is they were Bound by circumstances but they're now so the so the pressure of the king the fiery furnace all it did was release them from their bands and release the power of God to them because they begin to realize hey God is not just in a prayer meeting because they had prep meetings with Daniel and Daniel got the interpretation to the image that that King Nebuchadnezzar saw so it's not just God in a prayer meeting he's God in great trouble he's God in a furnace Hallelujah and all the fairness did was release them from their bands and they walked out and the smell of smoke wasn't even upon them they didn't need someone to Cut the Ropes off them God released them in the fire amen so in that great trial it just actually released them to walk with God Hallelujah and you're glad trials are built that way hallelujah amen so he's willing amen but he's he God is waiting amen now we understand that you know many people stand in this day and they say well we don't need we don't need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and I I really disagree we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need to we need the mechanics of the word and we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we're neither both together amen I was going to call this the Temple of the mechanics and the Dynamics now now the now the disciples had the mechanics and they had the Dynamics but they had to awaken him to manifest the Dynamics because he is the Dynamics right it means that some people think well we don't need the move of God in our churches no more you know we have the full truth and we've gone past the uh Pentecostal age but the thing is you know when God does something in history he doesn't take away when he advances so for example but just shall live by faith is what Luther preached right there was a lot of things Luther did that we don't agree with he sprinkled babies in the titles he was smoking he was drinking you know he's you know you know he was against the Jews and all those kind of things we don't agree with those things right but he preach the just shall live by faith so it's because there's a lot of faults but there was the truth in there but then that truth when Wesley came with sanctification you know he didn't throw away justification he did not throw away the just shall live by faith but God added to amen and then when the Pentecostals came with the restoration of the gifts they didn't take away justification or sanctification God added right to them why do we come now when the full word is being manifested why do people come along and throw away the gifts and the moving of the spirit I mean because but to me I think the reason is is because those gifts are set into the body to call Sin out that's the reason that people don't want the moving of the Holy Ghost no more is because God will use those gifts to call Sin out in the church amen to keep the church clean so we need the gifts I mean we need God to come down and tongues interpretation or prophecy and call out someone because that's actually the mercy and grace of God to that person amen because you know it's like David King David thought that he got away with it with Bathsheba we're told that two years after that all happened Uriah was dead they were married different things that that Nathan the prophet came into the throne room and began to power you know you gave the parable of the two you know one rich man and one poor man one had many sheep one had none and all those things and David you know called out his own judgment saying that man should die that stole the sheep from the poor man and you know Nathan said you're that man what was that it was a gift in the body giving Mercy to David I mean so so we need the moving of the spirit amen we need the gift see God hasn't taken them away they're still in the body amen we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost but then we need we need the so so brother Brian CC says now he says I'm just letting off the steam I said now I don't think that we have to um um I don't think that had to be necessary but I think um they've got to have a vent somewhere to speak about Pentacles see I'd rather have someone to shout and let the steam off at least they got steam to let off Hallelujah like you see a steam trainer can be just standing there but all the steam comes out of it well you know there's fire in the engine fuel's being put in amen there's a fire in the engine at least they've got the engines can run it's not cold and just sitting there on the train tracks right and at someone who begins to shout and rejoice hey let the steam off praise the Lord at least that person's got steam to let off Hallelujah amens he says no he says now if they would just take all that Steam and could know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of God would start moving on Hallelujah that's where Satan got in and made it all mechanics and no Dynamics back where all the uh back all Dynamics and no mechanics see there we've got to put it together we've got we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine amen we can't feed it on a Creed it won't burn it chokes up the flus it it will not burn it it was made for the word of God man should not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God I'll say it won't it won't be fed on opinion and and and it won't be fed on just defending a lifestyle that thing will never feed the engine of God it's got to be genuine a grade coal genuine a grade word amen without malice or Strife just a pure heart amen that will get this great regime of God going amen we've got to feed this machine on the word of God now brother bear it's amazing how much he emphasizes the Dynamics remember he's in the ship the Dynamics itself is in the ship amen see he says he says see now what if someone would have said Noah I want you to explain the mechanics of the Ark floating he couldn't do that he didn't know how the mechanics he just the Dynamics of us see it's the mechanics is what we want to know and he says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that hidden body unites together the full power of the Holy Spirit Will Will would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead the dead in Christ for 400 for hundreds of years ago will rise up in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit Hallelujah he says that we want Dynamics I don't care about the mechanics no no we don't want to throw away the mechanics we but we have the mechanics amen we have the mechanics we have the word right we have the mechanic so we don't need more mechanics we have it right and we can study the mechanics to see exactly the detail of the mechanics yeah right but we need the Dynamics and the mechanics to come together see we've got to have the Lord come on the scene to be awakened to make it work who's with me this morning who wants to see more of God in our lives amen see this is not just well there's a lot of Home Focus I'm preaching like I'm at home amen but praise the Lord yeah but you see it's see we've got to have the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost but you see now the disciples when they were on the ship they had forgotten that the Dynamics himself was asleep but then they needed to wake him I mean they needed to put down their oars of opinion they needed to put down their complexes and the hurts and their pain and refocus on the one who was with them see our God is so real he's so alive amen he's more than a nice idea but he's a true and living God amen you see brother Brown would ask the question and the world again falling apart now as I said we've had a Revival even personally we've all had revivals I want to you know a time of Awakening where God moved in great power but then where are we now in our Christian walk right where are we now you we said well I just started a couple of weeks ago God bless you but keep keep the freshness and the love and the Zeal for God in your heart I mean always don't lose your first love love for more every day appreciate it more every day I think it was Brother Martin who said to me after the um waiting you know um um you say he said man this is such a blessing to have a Christian wedding in this day it's a rare thing yes yes and and I think it should be celebrated well we did celebrate but we should appreciate it all right two two young people coming together as real Christians are getting married that's an awesome thing we should never take it for granted but the thing is we get acclimatized to where we live right we get used to having the Lord with us you know we like like the disciples well he's just asleep in the ship he's right here with us we know who he he's there you know we should never take for granted him in our lives amen because once upon a time I was dead and trespassing since I was living in absolute Darkness but he found me I wasn't looking for him he was looking for me and he found me and now I live in a different atmosphere Hallelujah and you know it can be it can be quite shocking really when you when your eyes come open you're spiritualizing you see you know what's shocking to see that you need him you're a wretched sinner you need to be washed you need to be cleansed but then you come through the other side and you begin to think man I used to live that you know because you can't identify who you are now to who you were then hallelujah I'm so glad God does such a work in our lives amen but you know but then we get used to being a believer it becomes comfortable but we should never take him for granted I mean we should always appreciate his goodness and his Mercy Hallelujah but you see now a brother bam would ask a question he'd say about this being being between revivals he'd say now I don't care how much that car runs out there it's got pistons and cylinders I don't know how much pressure is used the other thing I know is the Dynamics put her out there and and drive it that's and that's what we know God made the promise I'll pull my spirit out upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how's he going to do it I can't tell you I just want to know the Dynamics of God's system that's the main thing today we've studied the mechanics until it's all mechanical what's good is an automobile without knowing um without something in it to drive it what's good is the lights or the fixtures if there's no current to go in it see we've we've got all the mechanics we've got the schools the Educators and so forth that can train a man till he can stand the pulpit with such manners till he's an eloquent person that still don't bring the power of God where is the power of God that used to be in the church where is that Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches that's the reason our world is falling apart because we've got away from the real principles of God and educated men into systems and things and that's what it's got to take that's what's got us in this condition we are today I believe that's the reason our world is falling apart why because they got away from the Pentecostal blessing the Pentecostal blessings are just Amplified in the message that's right we have the full power of God we have all that he is I mean we can't just look back and say well those people had that what do we have we have that yeah I mean but you gotta awaken him from to come upon the scene hey man see my house desire is this puts on flesh yes and and you and I I mean that it's not just that we're not just a bunch of religious people that can quote right and look the part but God comes and lives in our lives and manifests what he said that's why he died on Calvary amen that every promise of God will be manifested in our lives amen because remember all that he is I want Hallelujah I want forgiveness of sins that's in him praise the Lord I want his transforming power to change my life that's in him I want it praise the Lord I want to be a new creature in him amen that's in him right but then in them is tongues and prophecy and all knowledge and gifts and discernment and healing all the nine spiritual gifts are still in the message because Jesus Christ is the message right you know you're forgot to come down and change our lives that's that's in the message right Hallelujah who's with me are you all okay today see see he's in the ship amen he's in the ship we just got to wake him up I want a Revival I want to Revival myself I want more of God you know I don't you know remember this this mountain or this Walk we're having with God is not a plateau right it's not like I was saying in South Africa who's saying Table Mountain you know it's like steeping this like flat on top it's a table right I walk with God is not like climbing Table Mountain you get up certain height there's just a plateau and you just keep going on until the Rapture and here we are no we're climbing a Mount Zion yeah right it's always onwards and upwards in our Christmas sure we may have dips in trouble but but as long as we're trending upwards Hallelujah that's the main thing why because there's more of God to have and he wants to give you more of himself amen they see all that he is is available to you and I he see he loves us so much he doesn't just give a part of himself he doesn't just give maybe a good church service and a bit of healing here and there no all that he is amen and and he actually calls us his friends amen that that he will actually show us the things that are to come Hallelujah he forewarns us before it comes on the scene he's made a way of Escape that we don't have to go into the Great Tribulation amen but all his power is not for the tribulation or not for the Millennium it's now healing right what is what will be the body change it'll be the greatest Divine Healing sweep that's ever struck the world where these bodies these add-ons will be changed from Mortal bodies to Immortal bodies Hallelujah Hallelujah but all these things are here yeah I'm not telling you anything new this is not something we're looking for it's here amen Hallelujah because brotherbraham said it'll take those seven Thunders to awaken the bride he says and he says that the revelation of Seven Seals is the seven Thunders so it's here right we're not looking for it to come it's here right now but you've got to wake him up he's in your ship he's having a good sleep you're journeying on the right way but you got to wake him up amen that's he says here see see so we used to be this power this Pentecostal blessings that used to flow through the churches where is it gone he's asleep we need to wake him up [Music] now the devil does not want us to have Revival no he wants us to be called lukewarm formal and Powerless that's what he wants us to be he wants us just to go through the motions not get anything more from God not be changed just just Plateau walk you know and lose our vision put our eyes out that's what what the world he wants to gouge our eyes out we don't see the promises of God just like Samson you know it's amazing Samson you know he didn't heed the warnings you think Delilah's trying to find out the source of my strength you think he would have woken up maybe after at least the second time but he was loud to sleep by the world until the world gouges his eyes out you know but the thing is see see but his the power of God was upon him to give total Victory to Israel and the power of God is upon us Amen to bring in whosoever will the dynamic power of God to flow through our lives once again amen for God to move in power that people come to the Lord where there's such an atmosphere around us that that people want what we have Hallelujah so finally the disciples got to a place they had been arguing maybe for hours as they were rowing I went from a testimony winning two to to arguing about The Parables that Jesus had had spoken and maybe they'd already split into camps about the different Parables that they had heard because of your different understandings but then as the wind began to blow and the storms begin to rage they begin to think well we can still have our fusses and arguments you know and and still handle the ship because they were raised on the sea but they came to a point where they realized all of their faith fussing and fighting and arguments has achieved nothing and they need to lay aside their oars their arguments their their their misunderstandings and call Jesus on the scene Hallelujah and that's exactly what we need to do this morning amen is call awaken him he's he's asleep because we how many times especially us men we try and work out our problems we're built to fix things we can fix it we can just do you know just just change our behaviors and make things a bit better and you know but but in our Humanity in our strength we try and fix our problems like the disciples and their strength and they're what they knew they could fix the you know they just adjust the sales change how they wrote adjust things in the boat and they'll get through the storm but they came to a point where they realized that that that in their human ability and all that they knew they could not save themselves and it's when we get to that point instead of just going around the Myriad go around and saying I'm going to do better this time and I'm going to quit drinking and I'm going to quit the drugs and I'm going to stop doing this and you know I'm going to turn a new Leaf you know when we get to a point where we realize we cannot do it we cannot improve ourselves we cannot free ourselves that's when we can call Jesus on the scene I'm got across the ship I mean got across the sea without ever Awakening him in their own strength but this God allowed the storm to be in such a way because remember brother Brown would say that you know because Jesus was so tired from the meetings and healing people and everything that you know he was so wore out and then then and then brother Brown said ten thousand Demons of Hell got into those waves and they swore that they would drown him it means I saw the same thing there's storms that come in our lives and the devil said I'm going to destroy them in that storm but in those storms is when God can step on the scene if you awaken him if you call him on the scene amen so they had to they had to now they had to drop their oars and they had to awaken the master Hallelujah I'm just trying to find a book bit too um because I just want to get this point to us because this is up to us right so they had to wake him up saying Master do you not care that we perish you know it's amazing how how they would they would think that God did not care of the storm in their room though he was in the ship with them see his remember God's hands are tied unless we call them on the scene he is the high priest of our profession right and he will not work on your behalf unless you call upon his name unless you take his promises and lift them before him he cannot help you unless you do that see many times people expect well God's got to just do a work and he's got to change me and all these things but you've got to invite him to do it you've got to be willing for him to become the master of your ship see they call them on the scene not that he would lend an ore and just join in their arguments and fusses but he called they called him on the scene and he would take over he'd become the captain of that ship and that's what we must do is we must be willing to let him take over our lives not just fix our problems but take over our lives I mean and that's what he did he called they called him on the scene they woke him out of that sleep that he could step on the scene and and calm the storm Hallelujah amen so they got to that point don't you care that we perish and sometimes we get that attitude doesn't God care that I'm in this state he cares he cares whatever if we're on a mountain in a valley he cares where we are if we're lost in darkness or a walk in the light he cares where you are he cares about our family he cares about our situations but they said don't you care that we Pierce Lord are you not interested in the fact we're going to drown in the storm and they woke him up thinking he did not care but he cared but he was waiting for them to call him on the scene and it's got to be the same thing with you and I friends we've got to get to a place if we want Revival in our lives we're going to waken up the Lord in our boat remember he's in your ship I trust he's in your ship if not invite him into your ship but if he's in your ship he can say master I need you yes I need you to come on the scene Lord I need you that your name will be glorified in my life I can't live this message in my strength I can't be a Christian in my own ability all I've done is hit people with oars and quotes and ideas and cause fusses and troubles but Lord I need you to come on the scene forgive me Lord that we ever were fighting and having trouble and building camps and all this trouble Lord we need you to change this reason we need you to break the cycle that that Unity will come among the body that will be love one for another there's no big eyes and little ears but we're all on the same team I mean they're all the same in the Lord so they began to wake him up and immediately he got up and he just spoke he said peace be still Yes Hallelujah and then then the wind and waves ceased and there was a great calm and then they were even more afraid of the one in their ship because they didn't realize the power that was within him until they called him on the scene and I woke him up now how about us friends today this may be a bit short but I'm just gonna this is just what I want to place on your hearts wake him up wake him up wake up the master he honestly the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost flow through our lives again wake up the master he's there all All That Heaven is is actually here I meant all the say we're going to meet him physically in the air right but all Jesus Christ is apart from his Corporal body is here right now the fullness of the Holy Ghost is here all the blessings of God are here all the promises are here there's no we're not waiting for a time for them to be unlocked all the problems have been unlocked to the believer if it's healing if it's Deliverance if it's for prodigals to come home whatever it might be you say Lord how gonna how can I come back he'll make a way he always makes a way for a willing heart amen that's a big thing it's not about the state we're in they are in a terrible state but they call them on the scene you know the woman of the well was in a terrible state but but she she realized that he was Messiah and she got what she needed amen the woman with the blood issue it's amazing how the chosen brought it out how she wasn't allowed because of the blood issue she was actually unclean wasn't allowed among the Israelites right but but she pressed past all the rejection all the things she would faced because she had to get to the master and it's the same thing with you and I he's here we can Touch the Hem of His Garment by faith amen can meet our needs even now amen there's no case too helpless there's no one too hopeless amen if there's life in their bodies God can do anything he can turn the heart he can he can take the hardest heart amen and make it a heart of Flesh amen he can transform anyone I believe it he he saved me I believe he can do it for anyone Hallelujah so we can call him on the scene we can call the Lord Jesus on the scene amen so how about you and your situation see pride will keep him asleep amen but if we lasside our pride in what people will think maybe maybe Peter because he was the Burly fisherman maybe you know he had to come to a point where he realized his pride was actually going to get them sunk you know there's water filling up in the boat they couldn't bail it out fast enough he could do all the things he tried he had to lay aside his pride of who he thought he was and he had to call the Lord Jesus on the scene how about you and I people are afraid what will people think of me well actually the Believers will actually think more of you amen say praise God Amen someone was genuine with the Lord and then and they came to the Lord Jesus Christ so we should never look down on anyone amen you know you know um amen we should never look down at anyone but we should we should love everybody that's it Amen Brother Bear makes a statement he says now he says um so so this is in the Lamb of the dove and this is actually the um Jubilee um 50th year from the Azusa Street Revival he he says now brother Brown what's the way back to the old-fashioned meetings they said just become Lambs again let's all just get back to being sheep the dove hasn't gone very far he's just waiting a chance to get back there's the road back to Azusa Street that's there's the place back back to the Azusa Street meetings again is a return to a lamb nature again now some people think well we're not going back to Azusa Street maybe we're not but what happened to Azusa Street the Holy Ghost came down and took over everyone was under his control and he did what he wanted to do in the meetings now how much more now the Bride of Jesus Christ we want to have those old-fashioned meetings again where it's not political maneuvering in man and human humans you're elevating themselves and you know just religious spirits but it's actually God comes down and takes over the whole service Hallelujah do we want those old-fashioned meat I do I want God to come down and just change every life and change my life and if he wants to anoint someone to speak or whatever more made happen to you you know he anoints the musicians the noise the song leader a nicer congregation to worship amen that when we walk out these doors with change we get Washed by the Water of the word amen if we feel need to pray for someone God leads us and we pray for that person they get delivered amen whatever it may be I want those kind of meetings myself well how do we get back to it see they had to become Lambs again and the disciples had to become Lambs again to awaken Jesus amen because they because you know when they disagreeing what happens that old carnal nature comes back and it can be so hidden behind message terminology and quotes and scriptures all those things but it's what a wolf nature comes and he's asleep but if you become a lamb again Lord I'm sorry for holding that ought against that person I'm so sorry for having that prejudice and that indifference towards that person Lord make me a lamb again Lord I want to feel your presence come upon me again oh God hallelujah what happens in that his great Holy Spirit Dove as a dove comes upon you you feel that sweetness that love for everybody and now we're in condition amen for an old-fashioned meeting once again and he first met the look the grass is greener the sky is Bluer everyone is more wonderful doesn't matter how terrible someone is you just love you just can't I just you just can't help but love them why what's happening why because the lamb because your Nature's been changed to a lamb and now the great Heavenly Dove the Holy Ghost is biting upon you and everything is awesome and God moves he just he just you know you're not worried about what everyone else is doing you're just having a Revival with God yourself you know like the Welsh policeman saying I am the Welsh Revival and everything's amazing his word is Rich and pure and it's great and you know who wants to come back to that yeah and I I I I placed myself on that tooth Lord I don't want any malice I don't want any Stripes see the devil wants us to have malice and indifference and unforgiveness towards people they can be on the other side of the world but you still think bad about them see we're going to get those things out we've got to say Lord take that out of me I want that lamb nature I want to feel the sweetness of your presence once again amen where you lead me in the scripture and you would become so alive and then yeah the message is more than just going through the motions of listening to the tapes with such a joy and God speaks you in such a personal way amen I want an old-fashioned meeting and not just on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday whatever our midweeks are about but every day we're living in an old-fashioned meeting I mean because what makes an old-fashioned meeting the people that come to the old-fashioned meeting because they're in an old-fashioned condition everything's amazing God's God's awesome filled my way every day with love Lord I mean you're just drunk on the love of God Amen his word has become so rich in this amen Hallelujah now John must have stood up brother Brahm says because he was he was one of the youngest disciples must have been young John get up his heart his heart wasn't so much so scarred with so much theology different Winds of Doctrine and troubles the younger generation got up Hallelujah his heart wasn't so much scarred with so much theology he must have said something like this think of it right here in this ship this one that that is identified by Jehovah's word to be Jehovah's servant in whom he is pleased is right here on the ship with us what a secured feeling amen when his heart wasn't so scarred up with fusses of the past this younger generation got up and said just think Jehovah God the Lord Jesus Christ himself the one who went to Calvary for you and I the one who arose triumphant the one who sent back his holy spirit on the day of Pentecost the one that was in the prophet's life in the previous generation's life that same one it's with us in the ship today just think about that very Lord of Glory that even the angels look filthy in a society so pure and holy Amy became a man to take our sins upon himself Amen to wash Us in his blood amen that he became sin for us it would become the very righteous of God in Christ amen that when he looks us he doesn't see our Humanity or our failings he see his blood he sees his own blood how many hears he hears our Voice through his blood amen and because he has done that for us we are as righteous and as pure as he is I mean just think about that one before there was a sun moon or star and he thought of you and I now he's here in the ship with us hallelujah just think about that one that the prophets met down Through the Ages is not a god of History anymore he's not just a promise anymore he's a living reality right now Hallelujah I believe that would have changed the whole scene right there when they begin to think the very God of creation was in the ship with them now think about the one that walks of I Fearless presence here now I feel his presence in this in this meeting here amen the very God of creation is here in the ship with us the very one amen that died on Calvary field is here with you right now amen but if you'll just wake him up if you'll just lay aside pride and trouble what people will think and say Lord I need more of you Lord Jesus wake up oh perish Lord Hallelujah he says we've got to disturb him there's an Awakening Jesus 1963 we've got to disturb him till you can see him come in can't our prayers disturb him can't our prayers awaken him from his rest till he to to bring him on the scene they did they cried out Lord we're perishing and he moved on the scene now we can do the same thing now do
