will come back twice as hard three times ten times as hard as hard as he can come but we are equipped we don't even know what challenges will face but we're equipped to face those challenges and if somebody cares about us that much it's only one thing it's love it's perfect love so whatever state that you're in wherever said I mean we be every single human in here we are well equipped to face

mean just put that second verse up for me again brother man please I mean we had this weekend but how that God loved us so much I mean that God stepped down from his glory Conley scene that became an I mean we sing he would us I mean what's the wooing it's when a guy is really interested in a girl he'll do everything to get her attention you know this is one of the big paradoxes brothers and sisters and God had created man I mean God who formed us Amy now stoop so low that he's trying to win our love back I mean and that's why we sing in the chorus oh how I love him why because he first loved me I mean we praise God for those things I mean I don't want to take a lot of time we are there a little pressed for time and I want to give brother Danny all the time he needs but I just like to take a moment to thank everybody every camper that was here for your lovely attitudes we really enjoyed having Amy now with the say my god richly bless you many of you helped on so many fronts and my god just bless you for all those things and I pray that this weekend was not just another camp experience but that it was something that will be lasting and that will be eternal I mean I also would like to thank that older youth specifically you know some of the older youth might think might think you know I've been to I don't know so many youth camps and what can I learn more all those kind of things but I thank you for coming and being a positive influence like to be a positive example and may God bless you for that also I also want to thank the non-campus I mean my brothers and sisters that came for bringing your league sapphires I mean for bringing your a means a meaningful also contributing to the services in that way may God bless you for for for your effort to do that I mean so now this morning we we come to the last service and it's kind of sad and I know when you get home you have all these after cam blues and you miss all your friends and all those kind of things and I want to just maybe say you know make contact with those friends you know something sweet just to see one another when it gets to camp time maintain those friendships maintain those fellowships as things can be a positive influence on you it goes through a doctoral maybe you don't want to share your heart with someone that's that's that you see every day maybe it's easier for you to share your heart with your friend that's you know sitting in another part of the country and I was please pray for me I'm going through something Amy but this morning we don't want to start negative and downcast I mean we have a god that's gonna meet us again this morning I believe so he's done that every time this weekend and we thank God for that so one day if we can just think I love him as we call her brother Danny up maybe keep the music real soft and we'll just sing as loud as we can I mean sing it from your heart Hey [Music] big [Music] ow [Music] a man certainly loved it that's why we're all here he managed to express that love back to him I mean as we said over and over we couldn't love him unless he first loved us right amen so we thank God that we can love him because we know that love has drawn us made us willing in the day of his power Amen I just want to say before we amen just give a little short sermon a men would have privily just been to be have been here with you all of you young people may God richly bless you amen we're praying for you we love you amen we wouldn't come and try to speak something that would be so far out of reach that you wouldn't have a clue what we're talking about Amen but this is a practical gospel amen the gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel unto salvation amen if this gospel can't save us and hold us and keep us and help us know how to live and to make practical decisions common-sense decisions it's the wrong gospel and this sound of gospel where we live in the rafters it's a gospel where we walk on the earth amen and live for the Lord Jesus so it's been a real privilege thank you for letting me come and speak to you I trust that Amen something eternal has happened in your life I mean you can go back home and say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord thank you to the ministers amen brother Ben hey man brother aller a thank you for the invitation may God richly bless you for it and all the workers all that had a heart and a burden I mean that's not your burden God placed it upon you it's his burden when Nehemiah went around the walls and was looking at the walls and it's Psalm all in there tore down condition he was desiring to build up the walls again but that was God's burden that had been placed upon him and anytime God places a burden on us he makes a way for that burden to be expressed so amen so may God richly bless you I covet your prayers I'm going home tomorrow amen I prayed you pray for us in our church there I mean I know they were praying for you here amen and we certainly do love you with the love of the Lord we're a body of Christ amen we're all for one another there's no big eyes or little use there's no great ministers we're all together amen let's pray Jesus we just have a short time this morning together around the word I pray your help us forgive us the words to speak that'll help the young people as they leave this place Lord not as camp-meeting stars not as something that just happened on the grounds but as they go forth into life soldiers that have been equipped Lord I pray your help them father strengthen them in the days that are coming whether they're going back to their schools or their homes or wherever they're going lord I pray that their paths of life that they've been on will have changed Lord for eternal things Lord oh god I pray they're being hungry and thirsty after righteousness we ask it in Jesus name anoint my lips and when two years they hear in Jesus name we pray amen I want to just read to you out of the book of first Timothy and God blessed musicians we appreciate Amen you all given your time and your talent to the Lord Ava and II appreciate each one that's given of himself in this camp meeting well I guess not I said do you appreciate everybody that's giving of itself in time [Applause] I think the more tired we get the our response gets a little bit further out so hey man I'll say something now and expect you to a minute in five minutes amen all right I'm gonna read to you first Timothy one in the fifteenth verse this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting now under the king eternal I want you to think about that statement that Paul said that God has done something in me that'll be a pattern to all Hereafter that's what God wants to do with your life your life will be a pattern for those coming up behind you that's why we have these meetings amen that God can place that eternal Amen at eternal something in you that will cause you to have straight paths and the Word of God will be a lamp into your feet because others are watching us now under the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and glory for ever and ever amen this charge commit eye unto these son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as war a good warfare Paul's telling Timothy God has not left you without a resource there's things that's been preached prophecies that have been made that you use them to war this warfare you see it's not that God has touched us and we go and say God now I'm gonna expect this feeling to last and I'm gonna expect this anointing that I feel upon me to feel like it was when I came and gave my heart to the Lord or asked him to fill me with the Holy Ghost no but you have to learn how war a warfare many of you outers can say amen to that brother branham's said this is not a bed of roses this is not a picnic this is a battlefield and Satan will study how you use the Bible how you use the message in your life and if you don't use it and if you don't pray he's got you whipped before you even walk out these doors there's not gonna be any say sustaining power the Holy Ghost how many have the Holy Ghost feeds on the Word of God holding faith and good conscience which some have him put away concerning faith and made shipwreck you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word just real shortly we just have just a few minutes and we're up it gets a hard time line if the Lord if the Lord can I just want to give you some practical words of advice as a minister and as a pastor I'm no greater than you I'm a minister and a minister as a servant sometimes ministers can can seem like they're unapproachable sometimes ministers can try to place themself up itself upon a plane or upon a place where it's hard for somebody to relate to their life but ministers are just the same as you they're all humans we're all humans gifts and callings or without repentance every gift in this room must be subject to correction every gift every calling must be subject to correction we're all subject to correction so what I tell you is when you leave here you're gonna make mistakes you're going to stumble may go backwards a time or two but don't be weary of the correction if we cannot receive correction that's why every minister must first sit under a ministry they first must learn and be able to subject themselves to the ministry otherwise they're not worthy to preach the gospel because they're gonna have to bring correction themselves they're gonna have to be able to say things that'll correct and rebuke and no ministers worthy of doing that unless he himself has first received correction and rebuke can you say men and so we all Amen must learn our place in the body of Christ that we have a place that God a man has ordained for you and nobody can take that place but I want to tell you God has equipped you goddess gave you a weapon and and we read in the Bible in the book of Judges there is a there was the son of Gideon the oldest son his name was Jethro he had a sword on his side in the day of battle and his father had one great victory after great victory against overwhelming odds amen he took 300 men and defeated over a quarter million on a man army it man that's not a small battle that's a great victory and there was no doubt that God had won the victory they could not have won that 300 men against a quarter-million men but they done it because they followed the instruction of God amen now he had a son as as Gideon has the men on the run a man he runs them and he captures the two leaders the two kings amen and he brings him to his son and he asks his son pull your weapon and slay them okay God is going to ask you when you leave here to use the swords that you've got use what I have given you now here's a man a young man he's equipped he's got a sword amen but the Bible said he didn't do it because he was afraid because he was a youth amen your youth does not mean you cannot overcome brother daddy it's just too hard you're equipped I've got strong temptations in my life you're equipped God has given you a sword a sort of faith amen the sword of the Spirit that will divide asunder and it'll cut out everything brother BAM said it takes a strong hand of faith to hold that sword to the heart of the enemy well this young man was afraid so he didn't pull his and you know what happened to him the next chapter amen his a half brother of his born by illegitimate she rose up and took over the throne took over the the kingship and he killed all of his brothers but the youngest that means jeffer lost his life because he refused to take a stand amen he was equipped but he was anonymous you know what anonymous means and no difference he's not a difference maker so you can either be equipped and anonymous so you can being equipped to overcome I say this this morning you're equipped to overcome you're equipped to go out there and fight these battles are gonna face you I don't know your battles but God knows your battles but he's equipped you now amen there's a lesson we learned from Rome Rome was the mightiest army on the face of the earth they were unstoppable but they were unstoppable because of their training and because of their discipline and then they were unstoppable but there's something happened with Rome Josephus said you've heard of Josephus he was the Jewish historian he said that the soldiers always carried their weapons with them even in time of peace furthermore they practiced the use of that weapon it never ceased while they were a soldier so they always practiced every soldier every day exercised with great diligence as if they were in the time of war so you have to exercise what God has given you the thing is with their young people we expect that what happened right here to be the endgame it's not this is where God did a miraculous thing in your life by changing the way you were walking turn the way you were but your whole life is not going to be an altar call you've got to go out here and know what your confession meant and you can never stop confessing these people think confessing is only the negative I only confess my I only confess where I'm wrong I only confess no you have to have a negative confession in order to then start on your positive confession you have to confess positive you have to understand that this word was given to you to be an Oracle in your mouth that you speak the things of God that has been written here this is yours you know you you're not saved unless you first confess it we we salvation never comes before confession amen the scripture tells us that we confess unto salvation so you believe that God is you believe he's a savior and you begin to infest your sins to him see because you believe he's going to forgive you and then amen you begin to thank him for it then you begin to walk in it and every phase of your life must be with confession because salvation is not just changing you from a life of sin I mean he brings your salvation to a completion when were changed in our body so our whole life amen is confessing what God has already done he say men don't go out of here now and just say God where are you no begin to confess his word David wanted to build the temple he gathered all kinds of things he gathered all kinds of material he's going to build the temple that was his idea God had even revealed the pattern of the temple to him but then God come to him and he's praying and he's saying god I want to do this and God come to him through the prophet and said David you're not going to build the temple but one that comes out of you is going to build the temple and you know what David did he didn't keep praying Lord let me build the temple he changed the way he prayed and he said Lord do what you have said in your words now that is our ability every one of you have the ability to come to God and say God you said you established me you said you would strengthen me you said you'd give the ability in the word you said you would give me understanding Lord I need more revelation then look up and ask him for more revelation don't just sit there and go in a circle exercise your weapon know the words Amen ask God to give you a spirit of truth because that is the Holy Ghost not a spirit of truth these spirit of truth let it come in and sees in your life because if your life isn't seasoned it's gonna cause damage in the body an unseasoned minister will cause problems in the body if i'm unseasoned the way I handle the word I can kill you where I should be giving your life come on Church it's not here I'm not here to announce hey I'm gonna I'm a minister look at me well glory to God who cares you know what that means nothing how many big shots we got in here ain't nobody who raised their hand now amen listen you're here by the grace of God you're here by what God has done for you I was nothing he pulled me up out of a pit now what I do back to him is in thankfulness for what he's done for me and if the shore come let me tell you if I don't tell you my shortcomings listen there's some things maybe in your life you as a minister you can't open up all the way just so that people will keep their respect but that's not what I'm talking about I have to relate to you my shortcomings I can't tell you every battle because sometimes you're part of the battle so if I told you everything in my life I'd be I'd probably putting you down you know what you really discouraged me some time I can't tell you that but if I begin to relate to you as a human because the last time I looked that's what I was I brushed my teeth this morning because my breath smell right well that's funny you can laugh we're all human here we all are the same and if we project ourselves if somebody's super spiritual I hear I can never help you because you can't trust that because you can't see yourself coming to that but let me preach to you like Paul said Paul said in me is an example for everyone a pattern to follow Hereafter and he had just gotten done saying I was the chief of sinners well everybody can relate to that and then he said in Ephesians we are now seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he took you from being a chief sinner all the way to glory as a minister that's what I'm called to do I am called I am called because everybody raised their hands I said raised it that's your faith keep it up your hand can of faith cannot reach out and take what the eye of faith cannot see so I have got to present this gospel to you in a way that you can see it for faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so you've got to be able to see it you got to be able to look to the unseen and be able to grab ahold of it and say God I see myself in that picture I don't just see my brother you can put your hand down now I don't see my sister I see myself there and Paul presented the word in such a way that they could see themselves in that word problem with too many camps we go out of here and we go right back to the way we are let me tell you you've got to exercise what's been you've been equipped with in this camp you've got to take your sword you've got a sharpening hey man you've got to work on it you got to practice how you use it why because Satan is watching you but you ever wondered what caused the downfall of Rome a generation rose up that begin to complain that the armor and the sword was too heavy because they begin to complain about their weapons in their Armour it changed the policy of the army and when they met Hannah born in the Gulf and all of these on the field they were defeated and they ran for their lives because they lost their discipline and lost respect because the armors too heavy it's just too hard it's not hard if you exercise in it you know I'm getting older you know I used to be fitter more fit than I am right now an age don't help me get more fit and I was in construction for 30 years and I began to pass her after a while I had to go full-time and I lost that edge of fitness that I had when I was working full-time with my with my hands now some people think being a preacher is not working it's like one minister in the state's Amen they're their children they at their school they they they have a kindergarten the kids all get up and get to tell what their father does for a job and so her father was an evangelist full time everybody else got up my father's a doctor my mother a nurse or some kind of occupation and this girl got up and said my dad's a preacher he doesn't do anything well you know I do do something but amen I I decided I'd go out and I'd go out and try to run a little bit because I'm getting I'm getting pretty unfit and I did man I thought my body was falling apart you know why I felt that way because I work out I weren't exercising it like I should have been my bones felt heavy my body was evie hey man my breath was gone you know and I always used to a man we got a lot of senior citizens in our area our city used to be the number one destination for for senior citizens in America Sarasota in Florida there so they had the saying about Florida they are Sarasota they either newly weds or nearly dead and it's close and I would I would see I would see people out there you know up in their seventy's running and they're going like this and I thought man they could probably do better than that well I'm not quite 50 and I could hardly do better than that so you you know you got to exercise got exercise what you got God has given you something amen amen I don't have to go to my children every day and reassure them that they are my sons they learn to get past the baby stage the parental care where I'm always patting them and saying you're a good boy and always have to need that reassurance amen now they're my sons they don't even have to knock on the door they just walk right on in they don't say dad can I be your boy today no they just come right on in you know my church has an office my church has an office and people want to come to that office many times I mean they knock or maybe one of the Deacons coming and they say hey so-and-so wants to see you but you know what my boy just walk right on in you know why are my sons and with that sonship comes a confidentiality a confidence that they know I mean there's a connection there by the blood a man that they can just walk right in and expect him and me to treat them like a father so the Romans sword and shield a man that had overwhelmed overwhelmed the world were thrown aside and they lost well I want to tell you something I want to read another scripture to you right quick I got just a few more minutes and in the book of Ephesians and I don't have you ever thought of this and I just want you to think about this for just a minute because Paul addresses that he says in the book of Ephesians a sixth chapter finally my brethren give up no he says be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day how are you going to stand in this day by taking on the whole armour of God and having done all don't try to be more super spiritual now stand I'm gonna walk around with your head in the air don't let the message give you an arrogance cuz that's not the Holy Spirit amen when you've done all then you stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about but with the truth you know why why they're saying that's the first first thing he talks about in the armor of a Christian and other soldier is how they're belted because if you're belted with truth they were belted in such a way it gave them freedom of movement they weren't always afraid that they they were gonna have repercussions even if they did this or if they did that or didn't walk in timidity in fear Oh am I gonna displease the father they have confidence in what they were wearing and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God what is the sword spirit the Word of God if you're not in the Word of God how you gonna know how to fight the enemy how you gonna know how to react when you get sick how you gonna know how to pray then then you're always expecting a miracle when God may say I'm going to give you healing and healing this difference in a miracle never say well if I if I go to the doctor I don't have faith that's a bunch of rubbish amen God brother BAM said over and over why don't you go why don't you go research what brother BAM said about doctors brother BAM said it's your duty if you get sick to go to the doctor well hallelujah well you know I've heard a piece of you if you go to the doctor you're not in the Bridewell hello I go to the doctor and you can't tell me I'm not in the bride brother BAM said God heals my faith God heals by understanding God heals by miracle God heals my medicine God heals my doctor God heals but it's all God's so see what the word does young people it brings a balance into your life when you've been over imbalanced by wrong teaching or wrong leading or something amen and it's put your faith in something that's not substantial come on God wants you to have faith in his words when he says only believe he means only believe not reason not trying to say well may be good no believe the word and let it you get that at work so he said take the helmet of salvation the helmet of salvation what's the helmet it goes over your mind and the devil's always gonna be shooting things in your mind you're not saved it didn't work a man you went up for prayer he was only emotional you only did this he's gonna be but you got the helmet of salvation on don't take it off and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints you got a company you got a company your practice with prayer now you're coming down to your everyday life you can't go to a camp meeting every day of your life but you can pray and sharpen your sword every day of your life and then when you meet the enemy along the course of your juni dirt due to your path of duty you can pull that out of the scabbard easy it won't stick why do you think Paul spent so much time you see because we're thinking brother Danny I'm hindered I got things if things would be different in my life I would be able to operate in that what why why do you think Paul wrote this let me just tell you something let me read this scripture what he said in Philippians he said I would that you'd understand brethren that the things what's happening to me and falling out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel the things that happened to me have helped the gospel so that my bonds in Christ are manifest and all the palace and all of the places and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds my bonds have helped people in their confidence I'm bound but the words not bound and they're much more bold to speak the word without fear now I want you to I want you to understand something about Paul Paul is in Chains and he is chained to the wrist to wrist of the elite Roman guard 24 days 24 hours a day seven days a week but he's writing to the Philippians to tell them how the gospel is not chained with him and this guard was the private bodyguard of the Emperor's means they were the elite of the elite there were 16,000 troops stationed in Rome in a fort a fortified camp they were called the palace guard and when Paul was brought to Rome he was placed in the care of the commander who then had Paul's wrists chained to the wrists of one of his guards one at a time day and night imagine this a different stranger is chained to you every day and they work in shifts for the whole year and the stranger who was probably antagonist antagonist ik - your way of believing a stranger would not necessarily speak to you but he would hear all you would say in prayer and conversation all day long a stranger who would be awake way while you slept next to you while you bathed there was no privacy for Paul Paul's guards heard pause thoughts when he dictated letters he heard all about the kingdom of God as Paul taught those who came to see him he heard all about Jesus and then he'd go back to the barracks and he'd talk about what was happening and pause witness a man he said he witnessed to the whole palace and how did he witness to the whole palace because of his chain not because of his freedom amen and because he was chained and then people had been afraid before to speak up we're free so sometimes your hindrances are because God wants to free somebody else your struggle is because God's going to use that to bless somebody others life so don't be ashamed of the hindrance has changed were used to advance the gospel if you ever thought of change in your life as a total negative something that's happened to sickness and maybe you've prayed and prayed and the devil come said you didn't have faith well let me tell you let me tell you what what Paul did while he was in Chains he wrote the book of Ephesians he wrote the book of Philippians he wrote the book of Colossians he wrote both books of Timothy Wow that them chains are still going on and on and on and on what can you do with your limitations I said what can you do with you what God can't use me I'm nobody I just I'm just a kid I Who am I sharpen your swords put on the armor and then stand when God's ready to use you here use you did you just stand there and I'm gonna I want to close with this I got four minutes left on my timer I and myself hey man I got four minutes left I want to leave you with this brother Bantam said this because people look at faith as a bunch of different ways how many's ever read Hebrews 11 I mean God's Hall of Fame amen amen Abraham by faith Sarab amen by faith receive strength enoch waffle God was not a man by faith able by faith Amen Moses by faith Joseph by faith Jacob by faith by faith but you ever notice faith took a turn by faith Amen women had their dead raised to life by faith they subdued Keenan's by faith the mouth was lines of stuff by faith they were tortured to death not accepting deliverance you know it only somebody that's kept their sword Sartre and their armor on wouldn't accept deliverance don't you tell God how faith acts let God tell you how faith acts you just believe brother Branham said disempower transformation I'm closing he said this he said here's this girl sitting here in this wheelchair said and we have prayed for her and she knows God is well able to do much more than this take her out but she still sits there brother Branham said she sits there because he never said she sits there because it's a lack of faith in life as she just finally believed me more and reached that place of perfect faith she would get out of that chair he never said that he said I have prayed for her and she sits in that chair and she knows that God can do much more than that he said but she has such a pleasant spirit she's in a chain said she even inspires me now here's a prophet here's a prophet who has who talks to God sees visions but the life of this girl how much affected how much did her life affect a prophets faith to say she inspires me the way she sits in that wheelchair and he said she's just willing to take her place she didn't question it she just said Lord I may not understand this I'm in a chain called a wheelchair but I know you're my healer I'm just going to keep believing what group faith is greater if God had took her out of the wheelchair immediately when she asked for it she'd become a spoiled child wanting it as soon as she got it as soon as she asked why am I not getting it why am I not getting it and that's why if you're not careful you think that's the way face

hurry all right how many has ever heard of George Whitfield by the band you probably heard about brother BAM talked him in America he was a famous English minister he had a profound effect on America and their time of their of their servant to England England that's why we have miles and not kilometers a man in inches and not metric and whoa why we threw the T back hey man cuz we're American anyway so he came over to America and he did he he preached a revival him and Jonathan Edwards up and down through the through America and he got he got laughed at him mocked because he introduced a new term to America called the new birth they didn't know because they so in in the different theology and everything and so they was given the term of the new birth and it caused what they called in America a Great Awakening and if people begin to awake that they didn't always have to pay taxes to England I didn't have to always bend the knee to King to the king and and it began a revival beginning the blacksmith shops and in the churches and and you begin to hear the ring Amen in the shops as they begin to bend the metal and and everything and begin to make weapons and it called an uprising and it's called the revolution revolution men rose up to a standard they didn't know they could and he traveled all around he had a traveling pulpit and it had buckles and everything and and it could collapse up to a certain point and they could carry it with them and he preached over that pulpit and who knows how many were one to the Lord over that pulping but in American public society a museum there's there's that that pulpit is on display and beside that pulpit is a plane back wooden chair nothing fancy about it this is plastic I know but it's something similar maybe just a wooden chair and they said in this chair said an invalid girl Oh all her life she only left that chair to die on the bed never healed they said but the way she sat in that chair had such a profound effect upon the people but they said they don't know which one won more souls to Christ I'm going to ask you how you gonna sit in your chair when you leave let's stand together there's much more could be said but I encourage you with all my strength don't stop here Winston Churchill when he came to give an address to the nation here he's going is supposed to give an or to give an oration to the people that's going to lift them up and and you know they spend time to write down a letter of what they're going to say to the people because they're trying to encourage the people because they're facing a great battle with Germany and it looks like because of the power of Germany that American that England's going to go under and they said he got up out of his chair when he came up to address the chamber and he stood before them and he said this never give up and he stepped back and he came forward again and he said never give up step back one more time he stepped forward and he said never give up and that was his whole speech and I want to tell you as I leave never give up you take what God has given you in the course of these meetings and you go whip the devil with it now you go show him what young people can do even if they have a chain of a limitation on him you show them that my God is a living God and he's the same yesterday today and forever he still heals he still delivers
