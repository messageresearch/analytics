Our first song we're going to sing is the the the verse says, "You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just tell you why." Because my sins are gone. We're are we are a redeemed people this morning. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, "My sins are gone." They're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn. and the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Regardless of the fact that we're actually alive, we've been given so many things. We're here this morning and we've been redeemed. We've been redeemed this morning. So, let's stand.

Good to be here today. Amen. Good to have you all. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to the scripture, shall we? We're going to go to Ezekiel uh chapter 28, and we're just going to um yeah, read down to verse 17. Then we're going to go to John chapter 3 as a bit of a context here. Amen. So Ezekiel 28. Amen. It says here now, "Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, thus sayeth the Lord God, thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou has been in the Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was thy covering, the Sardis, the topaz, the diamond, uh the barrel, the enher, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth, and I have set thee so. Thou was upon the holy mountain of God. Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise, they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned. Therefore, I'll cast thee as a profane as profane out of the mountain of God. I'll destroy thee, oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of of thy brightness. I will cast thee to the ground. I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee. And then in John chapter 3 and and verse uh 18 to 21 here going to read this says here he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. And this is the com uh condemnation that light is come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, and neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds uh should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. Amen. So, let's bow heads in a word of prayer. If you want to be remembered, you just want to slip your hand up. Say, Lord, remember me. Don't pass me by today, Lord. Come to where I am. Gracious Father, we have come to invite you to our lives this morning, Father, that you'd come and take complete control, Lord. You would you would increase our faith, Lord. Mold us and shape us, Lord. We want to magnify your name more, Lord. We want to lift your name up more, Father, that you'd be exalted in our praise and our worship. So I pray, dear God, may you come anoint every life, Father, not just here, those who are streaming, those who are sick, who couldn't be here, be their portion, Father. And I pray you would fill us all with the Holy Ghost. You would bind every work of the enemy, dear God, that you would just have complete liberty in our midst. I pray that no spirit would be able to distract anyone, but may you just have complete control, Lord. We surrender all that we are into your hands for your glory. We've read your word now, Lord. We're asking you, the great author would anoint it to our hearts, Lord, for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats uh this morning. So, I want to speak about bringing it all into the light. We we read here in in Ezekiel 28 where um where where the Lord is telling Ezekiel to take up a lamentation. It says upon the king of Tyrus. Now this lamentation is really upon the anointing that's upon this king. Now I just want you to look at this here where where he is describing Satan uh as he was made and what happens is when because the angels became demons because they fell. They left their first estate. And so what they were in heaven see every angel has a different function. They're not all made the same. And and and and a cherub anointed cherub is one that protects access. It's you know it's like a it's like a security guard you know that you know that protects the throne of God that so Satan was made to actually to to block or allow access of different angelic beings to come before the throne of God and this is how he has been made. Now just because he fell because of iniquity in his heart does not mean that he is not built the same way but he's just fallen out of his position. So this is really if we can look and see what the enemy how he's been made and how he'll work it will show us what he tries to do in our lives. Now he is very much uh very much made to to get between you and God. He's like a wedge. Now I find it very interesting where we read here at uh verse 17. He says, "The Lord says, I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee." Now, who are these kings he's talking about? He's not talking about King Charles III unless he meets the Lord. But yeah, he's not talking about those kind of kings. He's talking about kings and priests that God has made. He's talking about his bride, his children. Amen. That God, he says, God, so because this being, this enemy we fight has exalted himself, you know, in in Isaiah says he will be like the most high. He wants to be like God. But God tells him, you want to go there, but you're going to end up at the feet of of my people. Amen. You I will lay thee before kings. Amen. That they may behold thee. And so what the Lord is doing in this day, because to me, the scripture will be fulfilled not just when every knee will bow. No, I believe it's today. I mean, I believe it's right now where the sons and daughters of God have come to their position in Christ. I mean, which is above the enemy and his and he has now been laid at your feet that you can actually consider him for what he really is. I mean, cuz that's what happens when light is shone. It really shows you what that thing is made of. You know, who's ever who's ever, you know, maybe in the dark and you've got maybe a coat or something something hanging up and you know, it's behind a door and you see this black thing just it seems like suspended in midair and it and it can be scary. Not speaking from experience, but other people, you know, they oh, it looks like it's some devil's hanging there in the room and stuff and you know, you know, but then when the light comes on, you can behold it for what it really is. That's just a dressing gown, man. Come on. You know, but the thing is the fear because the darkness brings a fear. It gives it power over your life because you can't see it. You can't behold it for what it really is. But when the light turns on, when the light turns on, it exposes well the bathrobe. It exposes the enemy, right? Enemy is not a bathrobe, but you know what I mean, right? You see, see, it exposes the enemy that we can really see him. And this is what the word has done in this day. Brother Ara said when the seals came open, it just exposed Satan. See, it revealed Christ, but it also exposes Satan. exposes his works down through the church ages. And and so so the so the word we know is the manifested light of this day. This message exposes Satan for what he really is. So you can behold him. And and it says in Isaiah, I don't have the quote, but but um I mean I don't have the scripture, but but he's describing the same scene as we read here in Ezekiel. And you know, it says it says, "And they that see him shall say, is this the man that did weaken the nations? Is this really him? this great being that's controlled the earth and manipulated and brought all kind of darkness and sin. Those that see him will say, "Is it really him? Is it is this the guy?" And the reason we can say that is because God has raised us up above the works of darkness. Amen. Because we see him for who he really is. Now to to behold something is to inspect it, to perceive it, to consider it. Right? And this is what the word I pray that they your God has opened your eyes. You can see the enemy for who he really is. He loves to hide in shadows. He loves to hide in, you know, in many different things. And he tries to separate you and God. He'll allow you to come to church. He don't mind that. He don't mind you claiming to be a message believer. But what he does mind is when it's you and God are one. I mean, you can say, "I and my father are one that the word is put on flesh." Amen. He hates that kind of a person. Amen. But what he wants to do is he wants to Satan wants to come in and try and be like God to you. That's his master plan. But aren't you glad you've made a god God's great graces come into your life that you can see him for what he really is. Now um so Satan's really like a wedge. Now the girls who came to Brisbane with me will see some of these are similar pictures. But this is basically what Satan is. He wants to be a wedge between you and God. He wants to he wants to rule your life to to protect I mean I mean I mean to to keep you warded off. this is what he wants to do. And how does he do this now? Because I want to I want to go into some things this morning because, you know, if we know him and we know his tactics, then we can sidestep them all, right? Because you know, how do you win a war? Intelligence. &gt;&gt; It's not about the grunt on the front line in the trench, that's not how a war is won. It's by intelligence. Amen. If you know what your enemy is doing, when he's going to do it, what he's going to use, you can bypass it. You can take him out. You can destroy him before he ever gets near you because of intelligence. And this is the age where we have received the mind of Christ. Amen. That divine love of Christ himself, that capstone has come down, anointed our lives that we can think like the Lord. We can talk like the Lord. We can act like the word. Amen. Who is the Lord? Right? We can we can operate like he is in the world. Praise the Lord. But you see, so Satan always comes in. What does he do now? He always brings questions. He always brings doubt. He wants to his whole objective is to bring doubt upon the word. Now maybe next Sunday I'll go into it but you see the things that you know we are about to step back into the garden of Eden again. And so what are the things that were fighting? What were the believers fighting before they well you know the original sins what were they? Okay so outside of the garden it was Cain killing Abel right the intellectual killing the spiritual trying to kill the effect of the word jealousy hatred strife against the believer. So it was violence. But then in the garden, what was it? Adultery, sexual sin. Those things are the two big things that we face in this day. More than smoking, drinking, drugs. Sure, they're all out there, but but when it comes to a believer, those things were a big thing in Brother Brandham's day. Sure, they're here in the world today. But for a believer, those are not the things we war against necessarily. I pray you don't. If you do, bring it to the table. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring it to the Lord and he'll take those things from you. So, you see, we're so we're going back. So, so we're facing those things before we step back into Eden again. Maybe they'll be next Sunday. I don't know. But that's where I want to go eventually. And so, but what does what did Satan do? He interpret He interpreted the word to Eve. We all know this, right? He took 99% of the truth, 1% lie, gave it to Eve, and we're in this chaos that we live in today because he he brought a bit of darkness into where the truth is. And this is what he always does. He will present. He never came to even say God doesn't exist or he's not your father or you're not his child. He never came that way. He just put a question. Did God really say it like that? &gt;&gt; You see, and he so he always puts a question on these things. Why? Because he was trying to be that anointed cherub that covered her not to bring life but to bring death. And this is what he achieved. And so it's the same thing with you and I. What is the thing we face? Is the word really right? Is this message really true? &gt;&gt; Amen. Did it really happen the way the prophet said it happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it did. &gt;&gt; Does it really produce what it says it does? I'm a living witness that this message is right because I have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I've become I've realized that I'm a son of God. Amen. God has shown me where I come from, who I am, and where I'm going. I mean, why? By the revealed word of the day. Amen. So, so people put questions on it. You say, "Well, the question you should really ask is the same question God asked Adam and Eve. Who told you you were naked? Who's telling you these questions? Who asked you? Who showed you these things?" Because if you look at the person who's saying those things, I'll tell you one thing. There's no overcoming power. There's no victory. There's no joy. There's no peace. There's nothing good. &gt;&gt; So, so it should be that should be the question you should ask. Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who shared that gossip? Who's the one who's trying to destroy someone's influence? Who's trying who told you those things? You got to think about that. Hey, we should say it for what it is. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't sugarcoat things. No, who told you these things? What's their life? What's their track record? What are they producing? &gt;&gt; What was the serpent producing? Nothing. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even in the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Neither is Satan, by the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now, so he always puts questions on the word. And he always tries to apply um he always tries to appeal to our reasoning and to our emotions. This is what Satan does. Always applies to your reasoning and your emotions. If it feels good, do it. Really? No. You got to be careful. Everything you must do must be according to the word. It's our safety. It's our headship. If you want the protection of the word, stay under the word. If you want God to be your king, stay with your king, which is the word. Don't steer from outside his headship. Stay with him. Amen. You if you want his benefits, you got to stay with the king. You got to stay with the headship. Right? If you move outside his headship, what are you going to get? Not what you think you'll get. Because Satan always try and appeal to you. Say, "Listen, man. This thing isn't really real. Your parents just do this cuz it's how they've been raised." No, I wasn't raised this way. I wasn't raised in a Christian message environment. But God found me at university in a place that he that the least likely place. He found me there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Against all odds, he found me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? His election stand sure. So don't worry about, you know, it's not about upbringing. It's not about well, you know, anything like that. It's God's sovereign grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, so he always apply um um applies I mean appeals to our reasoning, to our emotions, you know, he he always tries to keep it in that realm. And we have bodies. We have flesh. You can't kill your emotions. You shouldn't. You shouldn't kill human desire. That's wrong. God gave it to you. We're all red-blooded, &gt;&gt; right? You can't turn off a switch. No, it's got to be channeled. I think this is next Sunday. I'm going to already leave it alone. But you see, you got to realize you can't just there's not just something that turns off all your emotion. You just become like a mutant, a robot. No, that's not healthy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, cuz what happens is the devil, he always brings something and perverts it. And perversion will always cause something to come out wrong. &gt;&gt; You see, and so and so what happened with Adam and Eve, it came out wrong cuz a perversion came in. So you always apply to those things. But we have to come to a place, you see, where see and then he will he will apply he will he will anoint our feelings. Who's had that? A thought has come into your mind and it's completely wrong but it feels so real. The imagination could be so vivid everything but it's completely completely wrong. &gt;&gt; Like brother an says you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do. You just keep thinking they don't like me. The first thing you'll be shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you. And after a while it becomes so a reality uh to you till you actually believe that person don't like you. and you might ball them out or say or say something to you. For instance, your wife or your husband or some neighbor or something like that when the person's absolutely innocent of any ill thing, it's because you just imagine it so. But till it becomes a reality to you now see now see what I mean. What do you mean your wife, your spouse, your children, your you can just get an imagination that person hates you and they begin to do something. They even talk nicely like how you doing today? Oh, good. It's like you start balling them out about something like, "Well, where did that come from?" An imagination. Well, where'd that imagination come? An anointed chair that's trying to cover you, trying to actually make you think your brother, your sister's not your brother or sister. He'll try and make you think the believers are no good. He'll point out every every fault that they have. We got plenty of faults. We're human, aren't we? And we've got plenty of things the devil can point out. But you see, we're going to look beyond those things. But what's his whole purpose in doing it? Separation. He's trying to ward off keep keep people separated from the body of Christ. This is this is what he does. &gt;&gt; So why should we go by imaginations? Oh, I heard this about this person and this person. Never trust a grape vine. &gt;&gt; Never never trust I'm I'm actually quite happy I'm not connected. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Someone got some sick tears. Maybe God and he just snipped that thing and you had to put up with that stuff. Why should Oh, I heard that down the grape vine. It's like Chinese whispers. Who's played Chinese Whispers before? &gt;&gt; It starts off as a man driving a taxi and a few people down the class, it's a purple monkey dishwasher or something. &gt;&gt; It's totally unrelated. We played that at primary school, right? And and everyone's trying to listen as hard as they can to pass the message on and they listen as hard as they can and it becomes completely wrong. &gt;&gt; So why trust the grapevine? The whole purpose of that is is for Satan to get in, bring separation that he can have dominion. Amen. Someone who's part of a body, the enemy will come against them. But I tell you what, that body goes shouldertosh shoulder. Amen. With that person, helps them out and they'll get victory. You'll never get victory in a Christian life living by yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not an island. Even Switzerland is not an island. That's what her uncle said to me many years ago. I'm like, "No, it's not an island anyway. We're isolated, you know." No, we are not. You say we're on the back side of the world and here we are. Last stop before Antarctica, we're an island. We're not. This country is connected with the world. We have to be connected with the with the believers, with the word. We can't be all isolated by ourselves. Amen. So we But you see now what does he do? He comes in He comes in through sin, indifference, and disease. Trouble comes in. He makes us feel indifferent. This is a problem with this country. Apathy is rife in this country. She'll be right. Take it easy. You know, and what happens? Indifference comes in. We settle down. We don't no longer press the battle like we used to. And that what does he do? He comes in through indifference. He comes in even through disease. Sickness strikes someone. And and God has allowed that because God wants to prove his word in that situation. But the devil, see, God is always whenever God does something, Satan comes in to try and pervert it every time. &gt;&gt; And so, we must be very careful. Whatever is going on in life, we don't let the devil get a hold of our life through anything. Okay, I'm going kind of broad. I'm going to but I'm going to boil it down soon. Okay, I'm going to bring it down. Okay, so this is what he does now. And then what happens is see whenever these things begin to be spoken about and that's the enemy has actually tried to ward off someone, keep them keep them isolated, what happens with that person? They begin to change in terms of they feel shame. They can feel guilty. They can feel unworthy. And it's actually that spirit trying to hide in that person. We got to realize I believe, you know, I reckon it would revolutionize our lives if we could see the enemy for what he is. You see, because it's very easy just say if someone is naturally uh injured, you know, you say you've got a cast on your leg, you got a body cast, you're in ICU, you can see that person's fighting some sickness or some trouble. But then that's in the natural. It's easy to see that, right? But then in the spiritual, they can be walking around. They can be have all range of motion, do everything fine, but yet they're in a ICU bed spiritually. and they think the sin that or the or the enemy that's got a hold of their lives is them because that's the way if you can see sin is not you, you can get rid of it. If you can see a spirit is not you, you can get rid of it. But when you take ownership of it for yourself, you think it's you, you can never be free from you. Right? And this is what the devil comes in. He never comes say and say say, "Hello, I'm Mr. Satan. I'm going to make you feel I I'm going to trap you into this sin in a couple of days. I've been working on your life for a while. I've isolated you. I'm going to make you feel ashamed of it and this is how it's going to happen. He never comes that way. He makes us think first person. You know, he puts a thought in your mind. I'm feeling down today. Things are hard. What's he trying to do? Get you on a road to depression. Trying to make you feel down. Everything's wrong and everything's negative and everything's bad. That's him trying to be that anointed cherub covering over your life. But you got to realize, no, life may be hard, but God is God. Amen. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. and I may be going through a hard patch, but I'm going to go through this hard patch and God's allowed it to prove himself and everything's working for my good and I'm an overcomer and the blood's covering me and and everything is actually fine. &gt;&gt; That's how I feel about things. I think we should be positive. Amen. This is the good news, is it not? This message is the good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see now, but but see, he knows that the spirit of God is about to exp let the people know of his works. And I pray God will do that today. Amen. He says he says that the he's speaking about the book of revelation here. He says now it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire. He fights that he can't outstand it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the greater work, she will be an invincible army. Amen. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan know Satan will be powerless before her. So, we're going to be able to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. What is that spirit wanting to do? Make you lukewarm, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; That's what the enemy wants you to do. Religious, absolutely. But he wants to make you feel lukewarm, formal, and powerless. And but God has made to make us be on fire without form and powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what this is what God wants to do. So so we if we look at this now he says he'll be definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation but we love it with the true revelation in our lives. The gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we will prevail over them. Now, see, there has to come a time. See, we don't walk by feelings. Amen. We walk by revelation. &gt;&gt; And you've got, you know, and we must come to a place like Sarah did. Sarah walked by feelings for a very long time with Abraham. She didn't feel pregnant. She didn't feel fertile. She felt menopause. She felt post-menopause. She felt all these things in her body. But because of the visitation of Elohim in Genesis 18, Amen. What happened is that visitation turned her heart. Amen. And then what happened? She came to a place where she judged him faithful. Amen. Who had promised. And I believe we are that kind of a people. We've come to a place. Lord, I judge you faithful. Whatever your word has promised for me, it's yay and amen. Amen. You're more than able to achieve it. You see, if you keep that kind of faith, you keep that because the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass. Right? So if you have that right mental attitude, Lord, you're faithful and true. You cannot fail, Lord. I'm not looking at my circumstances. I'm looking at your promise. Amen. Because if you keep looking at your problem, see what does the devil do? Covers you over, makes you look at your problem. I can never overcome this problem. This lust or this pornography or this hatred, this gossip, this jealousy, if you just look at that, you'll never be free. You've got to look beyond that. &gt;&gt; Look beyond that to the promise. Amen. You got to look beyond that because even Jonah said, "He that observes lying vanities forsakes are his own mercy." And he was in a whale's belly when he said that. &gt;&gt; He was surrounded by whales belly. I doubt very much. It was a big nice cavern that he sat in like you see the you know the um children's uh you know gospel stories and he's sitting there on a you know nice and he's covered in seaweed but he's got this big cavernous stomach to sit in. No, he would have been stuck like this and it's pushed against him and all these things, but you know, he said that's just all lying vanities. How about you and I? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we're told to walk in the light as he is in the light. This is a principle of the scripture. He says, "This then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son cleanses us from all sin. So we've got to walk in the light. We we got to bring everything to the light. All of our things must be reproved by the light. If we keep things in secret, if we keep it in darkness, then it can't be brought into the light. It can't be exposed for what it really is. Amen. You may think you have a right to hold something against somebody. You bring it to the light. Like brother Bram says that you know someone does something to you and it can be a genuine thing they've done and but what do you do? You go to prayer. You go shoulderto-shoulder with that brother or sister and you lift them before the throne of God and then and then and then you let God begin to talk to you about that situation and then maybe God will show you what they've been through and what's caused that. But he says after you've come down from that prayer, you'll feel sorry for that brother. What's happened? You've brought it to the light because brother Ram says that no mortal can condemn another mortal in the presence of God. Amen. It's impossible that when you really come into the light, you won't condemn anybody. You won't hold nothing against nobody. It will all be gone. You won't because you'll realize that thing in your life of that ought or that unforgiveness is really what is that? That's Satan trying to cover you over. &gt;&gt; But we're told to walk in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the thing is in this day the light has been tried to be obscured. As you say in Revelations chapter nine, when the fifth angel sounded, I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth. And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit. There arose a smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. Now I don't have time to read it. You just go read this whole chapter. And it says that you know after this all happens it says one woe is passed and two come hereafter. And so this has been placed in time because a woe in the book of revelation is a world war. So after world war I what happened? The bombless pit opened. Right? These these supernatural uh demons came out to torment man. And this is why we have such a rife problem with with mental illness, trouble on every hand, all these things. Why? Because this demon power has been released into this age. I mean what and and what is it like? like smoke. Who's ever tried to Who's ever bride and the smoke comes in your eyes? &gt;&gt; It stings. You can't see straight. Tears come. You start coughing. It gets in your lungs. You can't see right. Why? Cuz there's smoke has come in. You can't see. And it says the sun was darkened by the reason of the smoke. So the the sun represents the gospel, represents the light, and it's been obscured by the smoke. And you see this is the problem in this day and age where people are so caught up in devices so much. I mean what you know even brother Bram said about rock and roll music when someone hears that without the Holy Ghost the spirit in that music will catch that person take them captive. Now you take that multiply it by what we have today with with with Tik Tok and social media and all these different kind of things. What happens? It's actually smoke. It obscures the light. It obscures the light doesn't see we had we had fires what in in in in Australia a few years ago and the and the smoke came over to New Zealand made it a bit darker all these things see the the the impact of the sun rays could not strike the earth because of the smoke and because people get caught up in in in the internet and different kind of entertainments it becomes smoke that the light of the word can't impact them like it should I mean so you got to feel if you feel numb in church, you don't feel anything. I say maybe you're in a smoky place. Maybe you should step out into the light. Come away from those things. You say, "Well, I just need it. I'm so addicted." Yeah. And it is it is an addiction. Amen. The reason why it's so successful is because it is addictive. Like you take McDonald's, the reason it's so popular is because it tastes good. It's addictive. It's been engineered that way. It wasn't a random accident that even the restaurant is how it's built, the food, how it's made. It's all been engineered that that as soon as a child takes it, they say, "I want another one." &gt;&gt; It's been made that way. There's, you know, you I know I've said it before, but you know, there's the thing called brain hacking where where psychologists will be employed by social media giants to so they can tailor their tailor their videos, tailor their content that it hacks your brain. It it was once called once upon a time programs on the television. What is it programming? Was it programming your mind? It's programming your life. I'm not against social media and all these things. Use them as a tool, but don't let it use you. Don't let it make you numb that you don't feel the impact. You say, "Once upon a time, God was so real in my life and where's he gone and all these things." I say it's maybe because there's smoke. &gt;&gt; You just got to get away from the smoke and let the light strike you again. You haven't changed. God hasn't changed in terms of you're a predestinated seed. It's just smoke has got into your eyes. Amen. So, get rid of those things. If it's ruling you, it's not worth it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I doubt there'll be not a single saint that's redeemed on the other side. Amen. At the wedding supper table when we reach, imagine this, brother Armand. We're sitting there say, "Man, I wish I watched more. &gt;&gt; I wish I watched more realels. I wish I watched more cat videos." I don't do that, by the way, but you know what I mean. But it's so ridiculous. But what's happened is is people become disconnected. What's that? The anointed cherub that coverth has anointed that person and separated them. If you got young people who sit in their room all day on their computer, on their phone, they ain't watching. They're not learning calculus. &gt;&gt; They're not learning something that's helpful. I say it always leads to pornography. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It'll see what happens is the devil when he anoints someone, he puts them into an alternative reality. Just like brother Bram said, there was a young lady and you know years ago she was in a meeting. She had a natural heart trouble and God healed her of that. But now she had a spiritual heart trouble because the boy that she was going to marry ran off and married someone else. And she was convinced that Johnny still loved her. And brother said, "No, snap out of it. You know, Johnny doesn't love you. He had the wrong kind of love for you. He had a selfish love for you. He didn't really love you at all because he went off and married the other girl. If he really mar loved you, he would have married you, but he's married this other person. But she had this she had this alternative reality that she had built. See what happens because of pain and hurt and things and you know people you know because life can be so overwhelming. People build a reality to live in a world that they can govern and they can control. That's why men and especially you know people can just go into an online gaming world cuz they can't cope with the real world. We're built to live in the real world. I'm not against technology. Okay? Not against social media. But you don't let it rule you. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be your thing that that that that you're you're only a person online. You should be a person offline &gt;&gt; because what happens when you know you're you can't get your dopamine hit because the internet's gone. God forbid you lose your phone or you know all the, you know, the Wi-Fi crashes and mental, you know, all these troubles happen and the world has ended because you got you can't see, you know, your reels or whatever you're so caught up in your Instagram. We're not built to be so caught up in those. We're not meant to walk with those things. It's the enemy actually covering people over and isolating them. It leads to depression. It leads to anxiety. People who are so caught up in social media are depressed. That it does not make a fulfilling life. It doesn't make people feel happy. It makes people feel less happy because they begin to compare themselves with others. And news flash, all that stuff that's professional is all altered. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; It used to be photoshopped. They'd take people's bodies and make them longer and taller and skinnier and all these things. And so, so the model or whoever it is that the people are looking at, they're not even that in real life. In real life, they can be this this tall and this wide. Photoshop makes them this tall and this wide. And people like, "Man, I can never be that way." Well, they could never be that way, too, &gt;&gt; cuz they were edited, right? And videos are edited. It's all being staged. It's not real. You say, "Man, I wish I could go on that holiday." And you don't realize that that person has a crew of 20 people around them. It's perfectly, you know, all you see is a little part of the holiday which is staged completely. It's not even real. Man, I wish I had that life. Even those people don't have that life cuz it's fake. &gt;&gt; But you see our brain, see the devil interprets it to you as that's real life. &gt;&gt; What's happened? That's the anointed cherub that coverth. We are not ordained to live in that kind of a world. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I ain't addicted to social media. I don't have those problems." What world have you built to cope? He is our hiding place. The word is our coping mechanism. Amen. The world, the word is our joy. I trust. I mean, you feel troubled, take a drink of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Take a swig of the word. Amen. You feel down? Begin to read the promises of God. You say, "Well, does it really help?" Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He's my joy. He's my fountain. &gt;&gt; He's my everything. I can judge myself by the end of the week. how how how much I've been on my phone. If I've been on my phone too much, I'm down. I'm moody. I'm just being honest here. And I can see it. It's like, man, this plus this equals this. I don't want this anymore. &gt;&gt; Why not live a happy, fulfilled life? Why not live a life where you're connected to your family? You say, "Well, they don't understand me." Try and make them understand you. You know, we're all You say, "Well, my parents should understand me and everything." They barely understand themselves. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. We don't have a book to be the perfect parent. &gt;&gt; None of us are perfect. &gt;&gt; All of us have stuffed up more than once. &gt;&gt; Most of us never learn from our mistakes. &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, a re a relationship is a two-way streak. See the same thing with us and God. You say, "God, speak to us. Oh, God. God, you got to reveal yourself." Well, what are you doing? Are you giving him something to work with? I mean, are you giving him the word to work with in your life? You say, "Well, I feel distant from God." Draw nigh to him. How do you draw nigh? Begin to read his word. Begin to listen to the message. Sing songs. Meditate on his goodness in your heart. And you'll find yourself drawing nigh to him. And he draws nigh to you. See, he did not make us robots. He never wanted some statue to know. He wanted someone with feelings, love, emotion, thoughts, self-will. That's how he made us, right? So, we've got to use our own self-will to draw nigh to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God never when you receive the Holy Ghost, you don't become a robot. &gt;&gt; I'm just automatically and nothing's wrong. I never have a problem. And you know, no, he didn't make us. God never wanted I would have hated it if just say, you know, I marry Christine. I would have hated it if she had no ambition, no desire, no personality, no drive, no differing opinion. &gt;&gt; That would be a boring life. &gt;&gt; That would be the dumbest thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want someone that will push you, will motivate you, will challenge you, will bring the best out of you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants from you. &gt;&gt; From us, right? He doesn't want a robot and just sits there and, you know, I'm just a believer. No, he wants you to be a person. He wants you to be living, you know, a living epistle. He wants to see himself in you. &gt;&gt; Does God have ambition? Does God have love? Does God want to express himself? Does God want to reveal himself? Does God want to share his heart? Does God want to make memories? &gt;&gt; Does God want to prove his character? &gt;&gt; He made you like that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. But see, it's a very smoky day. It's not by accident. It's not like life has never changed. Now it's No. Where? How does the smoke come through? Through all these digital things. Through these things. It makes it smoky. We can't see. That's why it's so sad, you know, because people go back and they say, "Well, you know, over a hundred years ago, there'd be people like Charles Finny. They just stand up and say, "Repent or perish." And someone 3 miles away would give their life to the Lord. Go into a railway carriage, another person, the whole place would be converted. You say, "Well, what where's the power like that?" Now, the power is even greater now. &gt;&gt; But the smoke is here to try and stop the power. But I tell you, a predestinated seed will see through the smoke. &gt;&gt; God will get a hold of their lives. Amen. It's a different season that we're living in. See, it says in Zechariah, "It shall come to pass in the uh it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark." Why? Smoke. I mean, but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day or night. But it shall come to pass at the evening time, it shall be light. So, there is light. You say, "Well, it's smoky." No, that's only part of the picture. It shall be light in the evening time, and it is the evening time now. It's the evening time of the church ages. Amen. Evening time of history. The millennium's going to come in soon. But before that, of course, there's the rapture and all these things. But it is the evening time. So God promised that it'll be this smoky day, not day or night, but in the evening time, it shall be light. Amen. It's the same thing when when Elijah when he stood there on Mount Carmel, it was the evening time sacrifice that he made. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what happened is there was all these opinions. See what happened is Satan came in, darkness came in and it was trying to trying to keep the people, you know, to keep sin in the dark. It was that anointed cherub, you know, that coverth came into Israel through Baal worship forced by Queen Jezebel. And but now the works of darkness were going to be brought out to the light. How does it get shown to the light when the light proves itself? When you see the contrast. Amen. So Elijah at the time of the evening sacrifice, what did he do? He he he prepared the altar. He prepared the, you know, prepared the sacrifice. He says, "Lord, may be known that I've done all this according to your word and that thou and and that the people would know that thou art the Lord God. Thou has turned their hearts back again." So what happened at the evening time sacrifice? The fire of God came down. The light came down and proved which was which. Because before that, you know, the Israelites were like, you know, you know, Elijah said, "If God is God, worship him. If Ba's Ba, worship him. Choose you this day." They between two opinions. Why? Because of smoke because it was a dismal day. There's different opinions and things going on. But then when the fire of God came down, amen, it proved exactly who was God. It vindicated God vindicated Elijah's message. I tell you what, he's done the same thing in the evening time today. Amen. Where the true sacrifice of God has been vindicated. Amen. The power of God has been vindicated. Why? By the pillar of fire returning back into the church. Amen. What's happened is God has come and vindicated. There is light in the evening time. Amen. That's why Elijah would stand in this day. Amen. Brother Bram would stand in this day and and and God would vindicate. He says, "If I'm a servant of God and what I've told you now is the truth, let him come down and prove that it's true." And God would come down, heal people, discern people, do things that were unique to his ministry. What was it? the evening time light &gt;&gt; that he would prove what is light and what is not. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light has shone. Has has not our Lord Jesus Christ proved his word? Amen. Has he not proved that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever? I mean, he's proved that his atonement covers everything. Not just salvation, but healing, deliverance. Amen. Healing for the body, healing for the spirit, miracles. Amen. And the light has shone to prove and to show it's not mind over matter but it's you know just try and be a good person but there's power in the blood to change a person transform a person's life. Amen. This is what the light has done. Amen. That you know the light has shone to prove there's a true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And the light has shone to prove that our identification is not in a church but it's in Jesus Christ the word our sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what the message has done. Praise the Lord. What has it also done? It's shown that as as I said in the beginning, it proved that Satan is nothing but a bluff. I mean, when the first seal came open, that white horse rider, many people identified, even brother Bram did in the beginning when he mixed the horse rider, the white horse rider of Revelation 6 and Revelations 19 together as one because he thought it was Christ riding forth. But then when Christ came and opened the seals, revealed the reality of it is no. This one on a white horse with a bow, no arrows is not Christ. It is the antichrist. So the first revelation that opened up with the opening of the book, what was it? That he's nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; He's got a bow. He's got no arrows. Amen. He's got no weapon that can kill you. He'll just bluff you. But the problem is you. If we give Satan room, we give him power. He will have as much power in your life as you give him. So if something becomes a big massive problem in your life, you've given him a lot of power. Right? If it's nothing in your life, there's no power in it. And but what does he do? He comes in by deception, by putting in questions, make you think certain ways. And what happens? You think, man, this problem, I can't be free of this thing. Whatever's going to happen to me. What's happened? You've given it room. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you stand back and say, "No, Satan, you're a bluff. You have no part of me. I've got no part in you. this this work of darkness, I'm bringing it to the light to to to reprove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That thing can't stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's nothing. He's nothing but a bluffer. Amen. That rider had no arrows for his bow. Did you notice he had a bow? There's nothing said about any arrows. So, he must be a bluffer, right? Maybe he's got a lot of thunder, but no lightning. But we find out Christ had both lightning and thunder. I mean, for out of his mouth goes a sharp twigged sword. He smites the nations with it. This guy can't smite nothing. You see, he's playing the part of a hypocrite. Amen. Amen. So, what does he what does Satan try and do? Make you go by feelings. This is not a complete list, but this is just a few things I put together. He tries to make you go by feelings. Do I feel safe today? It's got nothing to do with it. Do I feel like I'm like I'm an overcomer. You don't go by feelings. Feelings have no bottom to it. It's got no foundation. There's nothing to actually prove them with. You say, "Well, do you feel full of joy?" You know, do you do you feel like a Christian? There's some days I feel like I'm a Christian. Some days I don't, but I'm a Christian, &gt;&gt; right? Who's with me? I mean, tries to make you think you're no good or not worthy enough. He tries to because what is that? He tries to make us think that we have no right to the promises of God by what we have done. But the thing is the worshipper is never examined. It's the it's the sacrifice that's examined. It's if the sacrifice is worthy, then the worshipper becomes worthy. Amen. In the Old Testament, when a when a believer brought a lamb or a bullock or whatever to the priest, who was examined? Not the worshipper that brought the sacrifice. The sacrifice was examined. And if the sacrifice was found to be faultless, sinless, right? Then it would be offered on behalf of the worshipper. Friends, our lamb has been proven to be perfect without spot or blemish or any such thing. Amen. And because our sacrifice has been accepted, we become accepted. So it's not about our worthiness, it's about his worthiness. It's not about if we're good enough for long enough. No, it's what he has done that matters. &gt;&gt; Tries to make us feel discouraged in ourselves. Who's been there? Amen. Tries to make us feel discouraged in ourselves or others. Tries to make us feel too ashamed to be trapped by our guilt. Even even victims of, you know, sexual sin or whatever it is, you know, that they weren't looking for it, but it found them. Satan will use a victim mentality to keep people a victim. And and what does Satan always do? It's your fault. You're the reason I did this to you. It was because you did such and such. This is why this has happened. And he puts the blame on the victim and not on the perpetrator. The perpetrator is Satan, by the way. Right? But so we must never let anything make us feel like we are at fault. We are the victim. No, it's Satan's fault. &gt;&gt; Who's with me today? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the enemy's fault. Never sit there with a victim mentality. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, we are overcome. You say, "Well, I'm too ashamed. I can never confess my sins. I can never make things right." You know, that's that is the enemy making you feel that way because as soon as Satan is exposed, he becomes powerless. Right? If he's hidden in shadow, if you don't bring it into the light of the word, then he has power. You bring him into the light by confessing it, exposing it, then he loses his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will he will make us think we can never be free. He loves to keep us in a cycle up and down and up and down and up and down and he makes you think you'll never be free of this. What is that? That's the enemy trying to influence your life saying you're stuck like this. That's a lie. That is a big fat lie. Amen. He'll use your past against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll make you think you don't belong. &gt;&gt; I remember the first time I came to a message church. You know what? You know what was in my head? Go leave. Leave. I was in churches before that. I never felt that way. That thought never came into mind. I came in amongst the truth and a and and a voice kept saying to me in my head, "Leave. Go out of here. You shouldn't be here." And I realized that's not me. That's the enemy. So I said, "Satan, I ain't going anywhere. You might as well get out." &gt;&gt; Amen. So he Oh, you don't belong. You don't fit in with the young people. You don't fit in here. You're a misfit. We're all a misfit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're all misfits. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We never fitted anywhere. That's why you tried to be I remember at school, you know, I got into the first 11 hockey team. Tried to be like a jock. Didn't fit there. Tried to be a nerd. Didn't really fit in there. Tried to be in this group and this group. Didn't really fit anywhere. But then one day, Jesus found me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I realized this is where I belong. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you do? He make you think you don't fit. You don't belong here. That's a lie. Everyone belongs. Everyone is the same value. Everyone is important. Everyone's loved. Accepted. Amen. You never ever think that you don't belong as part of the body of Christ. That's the devil trying to ward you off, keep you isolated. I mean, he'll make you think you can handle sin. He'll make you think, yeah, you can you can handle this habit, this thing. It's just a it's just innocent. It will always grow and become something that will devour you. &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't matter how innocent it appears, how secret it is, it will always devour you. Always come back and bite you. Amen. He will always he'll he'll make you think the word is not for you. Well, the word's not for him. That's why he makes you think it's not for you. I mean, he always give you reasons why he should stay in your life. You enjoy this more. This is fun. Just a bit of harmless fun. You know, people go online and they have this online persona. They start flirting and, you know, sexing and all these things. It's just some harmless fun. It's not going to hurt anyone. That's sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's harming you. See? See, what happens is the devil wants to devalue you in your own eyes. That's why men and women throw themselves at people trying to find love, trying to find security somewhere. They don't value themselves. Amen. Because the devil wants to devalue you. You are worth more than 10,000 worlds. Amen. You're more valuable than the blood of Jesus Christ. Because if Jesus thought that he his blood was more valuable than you, he would never have died for you. &gt;&gt; Right? Because remember, if you buy something, the thing you buy in your eyes is more valuable than the money you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, you'd never buy it. So Jesus saw you and he saw his own life. He says, "No, you are more valuable than me." And he's the prince of life, the king of glory. Amen. So never ever let the enemy devalue you in your own eyes. You're very valuable and you're incredibly valuable person. You say, "There's nothing good about me." No, there is. The devil just doesn't want you to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He will make you think and he always make give you reasons why. You know if things are hidden, if you have to justify a reason to keep things secret from your family, from your spouse, it's wrong. We don't need locked chats on our phones. &gt;&gt; We don't need to reason though. Oh no, but I need to keep this secret. Why? &gt;&gt; Why do you need See, what is that? That's him. The devil being a wedge trying to get between you and your spouse, between you and your family. Oh, but you know, they they just won't understand. How many predators have said to some kid, "This is our special thing. &gt;&gt; This is our special. Don't tell mom and dad. They won't understand what we have." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a demon power. &gt;&gt; That's a demon power. See, but it's reasoning trying to say, "Don't tell. Just keep this secret. It's just it's just online. It's harmless. It's not going to hurt anybody. It's trapped you. &gt;&gt; It ain't worth it. &gt;&gt; You are more valuable than that thing. And people who initiate those things, men come along to girls whatever more and they initiate those things. They don't care about themselves. They don't care about the person. You say, "Well, no, I've got to keep these things secret. I've got to keep it locked away." That's where the devil works. But when you bring it to the light, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, my my spouse will be upset." They should be. &gt;&gt; They should be. Why are you keeping secrets? I got no secrets. &gt;&gt; Transparency is good. &gt;&gt; I don't want the devil in my life. I don't want to give him just a little bit of a toenail, &gt;&gt; let alone an inch. But you see what happens is reasoning comes along because people the the devil tries to get get them to think you can keep this thing. But what happens is people become a human shield by agreeing to the devil's reasoning. Do you want to live like that? Is she happy? Is she feeling at peace? What's she doing? She's become a human shield. You say, "Well, it's against my will." You have to agree to the enemy &gt;&gt; for him to have any control in your life. &gt;&gt; He'll try and trap you into things, but your human will, you give your human will over and you become a human shield. And then he starts firing things through your life and you're frozen in fear because he says, "This is you. You're born this way. You just this is just from your upbringing. This is because of this just your nature and this is why you're this way." And you got to realize, no, this is not me. This is the enemy. What if she just begin running? You don't want to be like that. You don't want to live your life as a human shield. Gossip comes out, lust comes out, perversion comes out, control comes out, hatred, malice, strife, jealousy come out. It's just cuz there's a human shield. We're not built to be that way. That's an anointed cherub that coverth trying to keep you under his control. But God is here. I know I've been going down this way, but I tell you what, friends, God is here to destroy the yoke of the enemy. Amen. The yoke of the enemy is destroyed because of the anointing. So in other words, that soldier with his gun is destroyed by the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where where we don't have to be under the yoke and control by the enemy no more. You say, "Well, all my friends do it." You're not live. You shouldn't live according to what your friends do. You should live according to what your the word says. Well, it's expected of me. I won't fit in and all these problem. No, peer pressure is a demon. &gt;&gt; Peer pressure is a big fat demon. You don't have to buckle down to that thing. &gt;&gt; You can be free. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the yoke is destroyed because of the anointing. So, any any kind of you know you the enemy the the anointing of the enemy is destroyed which is a yoke by the anointing of God. Now I tell you what, we should ask a question. What is within us to do it? Amen. I preached on the statue of a perfect man a bit last Sunday and how there's virtue, there's strength in our lives. You know, we should create an atmosphere and an environment that if the enemy has got into someone's life through indifference or sin or, you know, whatever it is that they should have liberty to say, I can bring this to the light and I won't be condemned. &gt;&gt; I won't be I won't be made feel little. I won't be put on some probation. I won't put No, I will be restored. There should be an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost in our lives that someone can come to you and say, "Look, I've been struggling with this and I need you to help me with this thing." And there should be something in you say, "Absolutely, my brother." I mean, I want to see that out of your life, too. We're in this together. I mean, you should have an attitude around you that you don't look down and say, "Oh, I thought so." &gt;&gt; Oh, well, eventually, yes, but you've got to do what I say. you you know we're not here to push one another down. &gt;&gt; If you are like that, you've got the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; You've got a luciferian religious spirit that just wants to destroy people. But if you got the spirit of Christ, you should have virtue in you, strength that can be imparted. Amen. That can be that can be transferred. Amen. That a person can receive strength that they can receive faith to overcome the thing that's in their life. Amen. Because you got to realize that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. So always bring everything to to the truth. &gt;&gt; Bring every problem. Bring everything you know the devil wants to keep it secret in your life. Bring it out to the open &gt;&gt; and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. There's power. There's a force within the truth to liberate anyone from anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where is that truth now? Because he is the way, the truth, and life. He is a person. He should be in you. Right. So there should be a power within. Are we all together today? Is this all right? Amen. Got to realize you are you are equipped &gt;&gt; to liberate. You're equipped. Amen. To march up to the window, snap that rifle, stab it through the guy, and free the woman and the child. &gt;&gt; I mean, you got an anointing about you, the Holy Ghost, to liberate anyone living in fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's afraid that if people really knew who I was, what would they do with me? &gt;&gt; It takes courage to step away from the window. It takes courage to say actually this is what's going on in my because none of us really know our real self. I mean each other, right? Because even I say myself, you see me maybe this way. You don't live with me, right? You don't see me every day, every moment. You just see maybe this guy. You maybe think I just walk around like this all the time. You know, I used to think like brother Bram, you just hear him preaching. You think he's always a serious guy and he's always like this. And then I saw Sister Rebecca Smith, Brandon Smith's slideshow, and he used to dress up in a cowboy suit and dance around in the backyard and let off pressure and pull jokes and pranks and all these things, you know. I thought, who is this guy? &gt;&gt; But you see, I picked up a wrong perception of who he really was cuz he was a natural man. He was a real person. He wasn't just a stiff starchy preacher all the time, &gt;&gt; right? He was a real person. &gt;&gt; What about us now? We never want to put a per perception on young people they have to be a serious can't joke. We should be able to be deep and shallow at the same time. &gt;&gt; We should be able to be frivolous and laugh and joke but then also serious. &gt;&gt; There should be an ability within us to go deep or be shallow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you're only deep, there's a problem. If you're just shallow, there's a problem. You should be able to actually open up to someone, talk, they should be able to come to you with a serious thing or with a joke. &gt;&gt; And you should be able to joke, too. God has a sense of humor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. Look at the platypus. &gt;&gt; Look at there's a seagull kind of seabird with blue feet. There's all these things in nature. If you think God's a serious god all the time, look at those things. You say, "Look at the kiwi. Look at these ridiculous things that run, you know." Oh, don't don't step on that. Well, &gt;&gt; you know, when that thing went to England the first time, someone actually thought someone stitched it all together from different birds. I think this thing can't be real. Oh, it is. But you know, we can't always be this tense thing. We got to be relaxed. We should be able to be ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not God is not a cookie cutter. He wants us to He wants you to be you and him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. There's power in it. Amen. So big. See, even would say in in it say, "Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such in one in the spirit of meekness." Amen. So it doesn't say if any man be overtaken at a fault which is spiritual. Just say you forgive them but push them down for a little bit. No, restore them in the spirit of meekness. To restore someone is to restore them to what they were originally. Amen. Which is their position in Christ as an overcomer made in his image. That's full restoration. That's what the blood does. So, what is God saying? He's saying you must do that. And the spirit of meekness restore. If someone's tripped and fallen down, you don't leave them in the mud. &gt;&gt; You don't even pick them up and leave them in muddy clothes. Who's ever I'd never seen a mum in my life. Their little boys running around. He goes outside and he's just a mud ball. Or maybe he's in the mud and she just picks him up and, you know, lets him run inside covered in mud. Who does that? The mum's like pulling their feet in their shoes right now, imagining that, right? But you see, what do they do? They take them, they wash them, they clean them, they give a new set of clothes, and they what they do? They restore them to how they were before they fell in the mud. &gt;&gt; That's restoration, right? And should not that same anointing be upon us, if someone's raised, it doesn't matter, adult, young, whatever, they fall, they trip, they they even willfully fall into sin. But then they but but thing is if God is dealing with you, if there's something in you says, "I want out of this thing, there's a way out for you. There's a place at the table." Amen. But but so if someone even willfully does it, should not there be a spirit of meekness within us to restore that person? Should we not be that way? &gt;&gt; You know, cuz I hate to say it, many people, they want to keep someone in some kind of second category as a believer because of things they've done, hold their past against them. God doesn't hold your past against you. If you have sincerely repented, you you're placed under the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. On your record of your life, that thing is gone. &gt;&gt; And then we bring it up because it bring comes back in our mind. We say, "Lord, forgive me again." And he looks at his records. He says, "What is that? What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; I can't remember." God has the ability to forget. &gt;&gt; Forgive and forget. Amen. We should have the ability to forgive and let it go. &gt;&gt; Oh, but they should have known better. We all should have known better. &gt;&gt; Satan should have known better. &gt;&gt; He was in the presence of God. He saw the glory of God. So we So I pray we have that ability. We can restore one in the spirit of meekness. Not keep them pushed down, but restore them to how they were before they fell. God help us. Amen. There should be, as I said, a strength, a virtue that comes out of us. Like when when the woman touched the hem of his garment, Jesus stopped and said, "I perceive that virtue has gone out of me." Amen. But now you take it the other side there. It should be more than just someone getting virtue out of you, but you should be able to impart a strength. Amen. To break the yoke of the enemy. And that's what that's what Peter Peter and John when they walking past the gate. Beautiful. There was a crippled man. He was there for a very long time. Didn't even go into the church. He's just crippled by the door, hanging around the believers on the on the peripheral of the church, how I put it that way. And he was crippled and many people just stepped over and saw him crippled and left him there and left him in that state. I tell you what, they had no virtue. They had no strength that they could impart because they did not have the Holy Ghost. But here came Peter and John, amen, in a season. And they saw him and they didn't walk over him. They didn't just they weren't just sympathetic to him being in this state. They said, "Look on us. &gt;&gt; Silver and gold we have done." But such as we have, give we unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Raise up and walk. What happened? Virtue, strength came out of them into him that he was restored back as a healthy, strong, well person. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, that's just a physical thing." No. What about spiritual healing? &gt;&gt; What about a broken heart? What about what about a broken, you know, a broken spirit? There's regret and pain and anguish. You just overflooded someone and they and they're crippled on the ground spiritually. I believe there is a there's a virtue within us &gt;&gt; that we can look at that person and say, "God, use me to help that person. Use me to lift them up. Take them by the shoulder. Be a friend. Oh, it's got to be a supernatural thing." Many things are so naturally supernatural. Amen. Where you can begin to talk to someone, show you're a buddy, don't condemn them, don't be judgmental, just be friendly to them, show love. &gt;&gt; And what happens? that that anointed chur begins to lose his grip &gt;&gt; on that person. They begin to come to the light. Why? Because they the light has come to them through you &gt;&gt; by the life you live, how you talk, how you conduct yourself with a real heart of love, genuine concern. What's that? That is the light coming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Because why love or charity shall cover a multitude of sins. Amen. You have a power if you have the Holy Ghost. You have the power to forgive. Not by just accepting an apology. You have a power to forgive someone. Amen. By the spirit of God within you that you can actually forgive that person. But that in that forgiveness is a restoration. Amen. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe someone can hurt us or hurt someone and you can because Christ is in you say, "I forgive you, brother. I forgive you, sister. I don't hold it against you at all." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you actually, not in your head, but from your heart, you do that. And what happens? That thing is no longer hanging over them because the devil wants to use guilt and remorse to keep someone chained down. But someone who's got virtue of the Holy Ghost can break that out of their lives. They can raise up to what they were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, is it really that important about true forgiveness?" Absolutely. Cuz here we have in 2 Corinthians, this is after, of course, Paul has written the first letter where he's rebuking the Corinthian church because there's a there's a man who's been sleeping with the stepmom, I think it is. And you know, and then he's rebuking this thing and and then you know, you know, the Corinthians have made it right. There's been there's been repentance and restitution and all these things taking place. But then he says, "So that contra-wise, we ought rather to forgive him." Talking about that man, "and comfort him, least perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow." So here is a man who's, you know, the light has shone into his life. He's seen the error of his ways. He's made it right. He's repented all these things. Now he's sitting there instead of being restored. Now, now he's at a crossroads. And it's up to the believer where he will go. &gt;&gt; You say, "Really? Yeah. Yeah, your attitude towards someone can can determine their eternal destination. &gt;&gt; You have power within you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so now he's at a crossroads. And do you think the devil wants this man restored? &gt;&gt; He wants him down out, lost, wandering somewhere condemned in his own spirit. And this is why he says, "Lest perhaps as such one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow." Cuz he's sitting here with this pain. He's know what he's done. He's know what he's brought in. broader reproach and all these things. But now Paul's saying, "Wherefore, so because of this, I beseech you that you should confirm your love towards him. For to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things." So it's not just being obedient, church order, doing the right things that way. But what about forgiveness? What about the spirit of Christ within us restoring someone? To whom ye forgave anything, I forgive also. For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave um I it in the person of Christ. Least Satan should have an advantage of us. For we are not ignorant to his devices. So he's saying that he says you need to confirm your love towards him. You got to show, hey, this is done. God's taking care of it. You're free to walk on with Christ. You don't need this thing to be a ball and chain around your spiritual feet. But you can now walk on in confidence knowing that the Lord has forgiven you. The blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you. And let's go forward, man. Let's walk on together. We're in this together. You're my brother. I'm your brother. We are one body. That's confirming your love. Look, look, you're not a secondass citizen. You're not down in the back or because of you got to be on probation somewhere. No, you've been restored. You've shown genuine repentance. We genuinely forgive you. We've embraced you with a spirit of meekness that you'll be restored. Amen. And so why is that that that that over much sorrow would swallow him up? How many people sadly have sat with condemnation when they shouldn't feel condemned when they shouldn't? &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is that? That's the devil putting that wedge in to to keep them separated from the body of Christ. Because that's why Paul said less Satan should have an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices. So he gets exposed. It comes to the light but then healing's got to take place. Restoration's got to take place. And that was the but then the devil tries to get in during that time to keep separation, keep someone down. So I'm going to let's have the musicians um this morning. I think I just finished there. Maybe I didn't cover these things exactly like I really should have, but I want to ask you the question. Are you living like this today in your own private life? Are you living like this? You see that there's a gun, there's pain, there's hurt being inflicted by things you're doing, but you but you're so afraid to expose those things to bring it to the light that you're just a human shield for the enemy. God never made you to be a human shield for Satan. He made you to be the temple of the living God where it's not shots fired and people get wounded and hurt because of words we say and actions we do because of because of a spirit that's motivating our lives but it's the love of God is restoration there's something in your life that's hidden Do you think, well, I can't confess it. I can't make that right. I can't, you know, and and your life has become increasingly isolated. I'd say that's happening. You don't have to live like that. You can walk free. Amen. So, let's stand this morning. I think let's pray. Let's just let's just bow our heads this morning. And I'll ask you the question. If you want to be if you want to be free that virtue can flow out of your life that you can strengthen one another, you raise your hand. Amen. Because by accepting one, you're turning down the other. I mean, you want the spirit of God to live through that you don't push people down, but there's a strength comes out. People feel strengthened. They feel stabilized. They feel closer to God because they've been in your atmosphere. Amen. Let's pray together. Gracious Father, I have both hands raised. Lord, as we've gone through this morning, the tactics of the enemy, how you made him to be that anointed cherub that coverth to to block or to give access to your presence and how after he fell, he's still in that function trying to block us off from your goodness, from your spirit, Lord, to try and keep us isolated and under his influence. But, Father, we we are so thankful we can bring everything to the light. We don't need to hide anything. It doesn't matter how ashamed we may feel, how guilty, Lord, we want to bring everything to the light. We don't want the devil to work any part of our lives at all. And Father, you see the hands that have been raised, Lord, that we desire that Lord, when people come into our presence, that you would flow, Lord, that your virtue, your strength of your Holy Spirit would flow out of our lives, oh God, not even consciously, but just the atmosphere of your presence around us, Lord. the words we speak, Lord, the the love we show, Lord, would would strengthen those around us, oh God, that people would say after they came to church or came into our presence, something's touched me. Something's influenced my life. Something's happened. And we can say, "Virtues flowed out into that person." May you grant that, dear God. Father, may we never be judgmental, push anyone down, but Lord, may our hearts just be restoration, wanting to see our brother or sister restored. May we just be so loving, Lord, that people would not want to hide anything that's bad, but they would want to expose the enemy, knowing that this is a safe place, that they can make things right, that they can be free. Granted, dear God, I pray you'd forgive us of our sins and our wrongs. Lord Jesus, I pray for anyone here who's isolated themselves online or some alternative world and they're and they're trapped in something they can't get out of. Dear God, I believe your grace is here to liberate them. So, Father, even now, Lord, I pray you touch them. May they see they're valuable. They're more valuable than that thing that's caged them. Oh God, they're worth more than 10,000 worlds. Lord Jesus, may they walk free, Lord. I believe your anointing here is is here to destroy the yoke of the enemy. Father, I pray you'll bless each one. We thank you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. What song you got there, bro? Want to speak the name of Jesus.
