Bible says for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an aen and all the proud ye in all that do wickedly shall be stbl and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that he shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as cves of the stone and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this say the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in ARB for all Israel with the judges and judgments behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the F fathers let I come and smite the Earth with a kiss let's just bow our heads almighty God we want to give you thanks because you're an awesome God Lord thank you for all your blessings we I want to ask you Lord to please use me this evening Lord to talk to you people take me out of here Lord and just be you the one that's going to speak I ask you this in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have your s God bless you Saints so that's a well-known scripture for us that was my favorite chapter in the Bible when I was growing I was waiting for an Elijah I don't know how but God put that Revelation in my life and that's why I did whatever I did because I was waiting for Elijah I knew the before the coming of Christ Elijah has to come I didn't know anything about the prophet didn't know about anything about brother Brandon I was waiting for an Elijah so when I hear about this message it really talk to my heart and caught me and the Lord delivered me that's awesome Amen so I want to talk to you today about the reaction brother um arm man talk about this a couple of weeks ago I think and this thought um stayed in my mind so you know for every action that you do is going to be a reaction and actually just if to be a little bit smart here it's one of the the Third Law of Newton it says um the Third Law of Newton say for every action in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction so everything what you do is going to bring to you a reaction and you cannot Escape for that it's going to happen so um this world has been 6,000 years of sin on this world that's why the reaction of that sin is going to be the completely destruction of this world and I hope that you don't want to be there because that's going to be a really hot day but you're going to get caught up in heaven amen yeah but the we know that the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen so there's no reason to get caught up there because the Lord is giving you the chance to turn your life give your life to him and he's going to take you out of here there's no way there's no reason to be there amen so during our life we're going to have to take many many decisions from the very first moment that you open your eyes you're taking decisions what are you going to wear what are you going to how you going to dress up what are you going to do are you going to brush your teeth are you not going to brush your teeth what are you going to H full of decisions but there's a really important decision the most important decision that you can take is follow Christ and that's the decision that you never going to be like um you're never going to reget regret it follow Christ has been the best decision that I've taken my entire life and then marry my wife because otherwise she she's watching but if we see through the Bible it's um that's gain and able the twins they grew up together they were brothers but there was one decision that changed him forever they had to present a sacrifice to the Lord and one of them did good and the other one did wrong but he didn't want it to learn he thought that he was very smart and he wanted to show his brother that he was best than him better than him and the Bible says that we shouldn't even treat bad with words our brothers and sisters so that's I'm just going to leave there don't don't treat bad the people because you can be accused of mother amen that's in the Bible I'm not I'm not inventing things so that's um Cain killing his brother he took a really bad decision and the consequences of that was that he got cursed by God in the other hand we have Enoch that he decided to walk with God and because he decided that God took him out of the earth he walked with God and God took him out of it so that decision is Chang for changing forever and he's in eternity now amen but this Earth and what's the condition of this Earth today I didn't put the like the name of the scripture but I'm pretty sure this is Luke 17 I think Luke 17 says and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drun they married wives wives multiple they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all they were too busy to listen that Prophet talking to them because Noah was preaching to them he was telling them destruction is coming but they were too busy in their normal day getting married to wives they were too busy doing stuff they didn't wanted to listen and that's why the Lord destroyed that the world likewise also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and Bri stom from from heaven and Destroy them all again they were too busy doing their own stuff God sent them two angels and they tried to abuse him they were so prar there such a homosexuality living in that City that they wanted to abuse Angels that's why they got destroyed amen that's the state of this world that's the decision that they have been taken they already took it the world is going to get destroyed that's going to happen the Lord said it so this is first Romans this world who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creatures more than the Creator for who is blessed forever amen amen for this cause God gave them unto a v Affliction for even the woman did change the natural use into the which is against nature and likewise also the men living the natural ear of the woman buring in their last one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their era which was meat you can see this today like it was in the days of Sodom like it was in the days of Noah it's today amen uh prophet Isaiah says in um Isaiah 66 oh no I lo this um Isaiah 66 verse three yeah they have chosen their own ways and their soul Delight in their Abominations I also will choose their delusions and will bring them fears upon them because when I called none did answer when I SP spoke they did not hear but they did evil before my eyes and chose that it which I delighted not that's the worst stage that you can get when you know the truth and you decide not to do it I'm I'm sorry I don't know why the Lord put this thought in my heart because there is not quite what I normally talk so there's some decisions some there's some good habits that you can have and there's some destructive habits that you can create in your own life like if you get up and you take um you brush your teeth you have a bath all the ones that you can see there in the little picture it's going to help you to be a healthy person it's going to help you have you seen people that don't brush their teeth what happen to them it's bad but you can take good decisions and that's a good decision to do like in a in a natural way but if you pray and if you seek from the Lord your spirit is going to grow Galatians 6 says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh s shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting amen so if if you want um material things you can get them but that they are not going to stay with you forever they're going to disappear but if you s it full the spirit that's um Everlasting thing that you can do well I have a point but I think that I'm like getting like way too on the way Isaiah 8 says for they have sown the wind they shall reap the Whirlwind and you know like the entire world knows that if you do something you're going to get a reaction they can call it karma they different ways that they call it but because it's a law and actually happen if you do something you going to have to wait for a reaction and I wanted to talk to you about King David was King David a good man or a bad man for the kids was it good oh you don't know no he was a good man he was a man of God but his life in his life you can see this action and reaction thing amen you know what he did he he went out with the woman of another another man that woman got pregnant and then he decided to cover his sin by killing that man but the way that David let's just read the Bible Second Kings says now therefore the sword is Nathan talking to him after all of this now therefore the sword shall NE depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has has taken the wife of of orah he to be thy wife thus sayith the Lord behold I will rise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thine wives before thine eyes and give them unto the neighbors and he shall lie with they with thy wives in the side of the son for thou did in did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not lie so even though David did wrong he repent but he has to accept the consequences of his act terrible things were just about to happen to his to his house to the kingdom because he took a bad decision so just be careful with this decisions that you're going to take because you can repent and the Lord can forgive you but you're going to have to live with the consequences and you as all teenagers well this is a youth meeting sorry sorry all guys the consequences are going to stick with you for the rest of your life like David like many other examples be cautious with the thing that you do be cautious with the people that you hang around if you have bad friends even if there's some people with good Hearts but they do silly things and they can drag you to do silly stuff too and then you're going to get consequences because of that you can get um the Lord he can forgive you but there's some consequences that you're going to have to live with them and um yeah that's about myON that's what I said to brother Ben if I do something they I'm going to need your help to come here and fix it yeah let's have the musicians and just remember give your life to the Lord is the best decision that you can make in Spanish we we don't make decisions we take them so if I have said that thing just sorry cuz we take decisions we don't make them and yep let just have the musicians which songs can we do um K just let me say by just God bless you Saints thank you Jimmy thank you Jimmy for that let should sing 10,000 reasons I think that's e try E Yeah e oh my soul oh my soul oh worship his whole leing sing like never sing like never before oh my soul I worship your the name bless the Lord bless the Lord oh my soul oh oh my soul worship His holy name sing like never sing like never before oh my soul I worship your Holy Name bless the Lord bless the Lord all my soul oh my [Music] soul name sing like never before Oh my soul I worship your holy name amen praise the Lord amen thank you musicians thanks brother ker well I'm going to continue on from where Jimmy left off because my opening scripture is right after what he said when Nathan came and spoke to David we don't hatch these things up he stayed at my house last night but we didn't talk about what we're preaching okay just for so we're going to go to second Samuel that was in Kings but if you read the order of the story um this this is um right after after that where um Nathan says the sword will not leave your house um and then and then this happens so I like that you don't make decisions you take decisions what ones are you taking God help us make the right ones we'll take the right ones so it says here so say 2 Samuel 13:1 I'll try and not be um long it says here and it came to pass after this so what we just heard after this that Absalon the son of David had a feir sister whose name was Tamar and Ammon the son of David loved her and Ammon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and Ammon thought it hard for him to do anything to her but Ammon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of Shima David's brother and jonadab was a very subtle man he's a very crafty guy and he said unto him why art thou being the King's son lean from day to day wil thou not tell me and Ammon said unto him I love Tamar my brother absalon's sister and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him I pray thee let my sister Tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her hand so Ammon lay down made himself sick and when the King was come to see him Ammon said unto the king I pray thee let Tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her hand then David sent um home to Tamar saying go now to thy Brother ammon's house and dress his meat so Tamar went to her brother ammon's house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and Ammon said he have all um have out all men from me and they went out every man from him and Ammon said unto Tamar bring the meat into the chamber thma eat of thine hand and Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to Ammon her brother and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took her took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister and she answered him nay my brother do not force me do for No Such Thing ought to be done in Israel do uh do not thou this folly and I whether shall I cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shall be as one of the fools in Israel now therefore I pray thee speak unto the king and he will not withhold me from thee how be it he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her then Ammon hated her exceedingly for that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and Ammon said unto her arise be gone what a messy picture let's um let's pray shall we this afternoon gracious father we thank you so much Lord we can gather one more time just want to ask as we have read your word I pray you the great author of the word would anoint both speaker and hearer may have your way uh in the service we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats I want to speak about trying to contain the uncontainable you know there's a saying uh with the zoo and so on or wild animals do not feed the animals because they'll hang around you and they'll cause you trouble and we know the devil is in the Bible it says he's the Beast and that word Beast is an untamable creature now here we have this this this picture of of uh Ammon here and and he has this fixation on her on his half sister Tam and what happens is is a desire you must be very careful where your desires take you here was this this man who did this exceedingly evil thing and he became so obsessed with with her uh with with his half sister you see people are obsessed with things in this day you know there's stalkers there's all kind of things people stalk people online you know but they create this insane reality about this person and you see that once and you could see his love was well perverted for her cuz one he he raped her two when he had done when when when the spirit had finished doing what it wanted to do in his life then he hated her so it wasn't a real it wasn't a real love it was just a perverted love it was a spirit motivating him to to do this now you see the thing is Ammon did not have the if I go back up here his vexation could not be expressed until until someone else came along you got to be very careful with the advice that you follow see this guy Jon ad debas the Bible says was a very subtle man very crafty man and he he allow he he he put the idea in ammon's mind how he can engineer a scene that he can have have his desire so you must be very careful where your your decision well the counsil you keep because evil spirits like to congregate together because in strength and numbers there strength and so these two Ammon couldn't do what he wanted he could not do what he wanted to do until jonadab gave him a way of doing it so people can become so vexed about something they just have to have this person have to have this thing it becomes their Obsession but it becomes a very sick Obsession it's not a Godly thing it's you it's a perverted desire and what's happens is this is this is a spirit comes into someone's life and causes us to be so you know brother Bram says we bump into demons every day don't realize it so we must be careful with our I know everyone's listening pretty your tattingers are turned on you're listening but you see we must be careful with what we uh the the the council we take and also the decisions we take because Spirits congregate together people will will become friends and outwardly it makes no sense why they're friends but it's actually Spirits joining themselves together now it says here in James let no man say that when I was tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither temp tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has con conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death he sayso not ER my beloved brethren we got to understand that both jonadab and Ammon they were in the King's house they were related to David either his son or his nephew they were raised up in church they were believers but somehow Ammon began to toy with this toy with this Obsession of his half sister and it grew from just maybe a thought and became such a reality to him that that his whole life was now fixed on her I'm I'm just going to leave that there I just want you to think of it see we got to be careful with what we get we allow ourselves allow our imagination we got to be careful we allow it to take us because we know the devil will will put a thought in our mind but then he'll anoint our feelings in our body and then because those feelings be so real we think it's the thing to follow but do not feed the animals do not feed this flesh right if it's if if it's not godly get rid of it right it's it's like brother Isaac preached a while ago how you know love in a marriage is is wholesome and right we know the bad is undefiled the Bible said but you take that same thing like a fire right it's in the fireplace it's good it's right it's safe it's good it's proper it should be burning but Outside the Fire just causes a Havoc you know outside the fireplace right so the same thing but in the wrong place this is what AMOM was doing now there's an old saying says show me your company I'll tell you who you are and that's right birds of a feather flock together or I'll say Spirits flock together right so you got to be very aware and careful who you gravitate towards because actually what it really is many times it's a Spirits calling out for each other and the the more the more a spirit can congregate together the more hold it has now it's amazing if you look at because you see sometimes people and you can see it at Camp you can see it anywhere people who begin to fellowship with with each other but they have nothing in common it makes humanly no sense why are these guys friends why are they hanging out it's actually Spirits are calling for fellowship and you see even this with Herod you know Jesus here was you know pilate sent sent Jesus to Herod uh and and if you read this I don't have the whole chapter here but you know Herod wanted to see a miracle of them and of course Jesus doesn't clown for anyone and then so it says in Herod went uh with his Men of War set him at n and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate and the same day pilot and Herod were made friends together for before they had were at enity between themselves so what caused them to become friends is that Antichrist spirit that caused the crucifixion was on pilate and it was on Herod so they had all things in common now they became friends but naturally you think pilate who's pilate he's a Roman Herod he's a a you know Jewish usurper they called them so they had nothing in common until that day so the spirit upon each of them brought Fellowship that's crazy but you see they had an attraction to they were friends now because the Same Spirit was upon each of them I really pray our friendships are because of the Holy Ghost you know that that that that that that we what we have in common is the Lord not some not some uh lust Spirit not some adultery Spirit not some evil spirit of the world lying whatever it may be but but what connects us is the Holy Ghost not not a spirit right but you see now Spirits congregate together and it gives them strength you know there's a saying you know one will chase a th000 two will chase 10,000 that's about Believers right there's strength and numbers there's strength and numbers with the devil as well and he knows this this is why he always calls out tries to reinforce himself you know a three-fold cord is not easily broken the Bible says the devil knows that too he uses that quite well if he can get more than you know if get three people to agree about something that will spread like wildfire if it's one it's just an opinion two well it's just them three it takes a established thing that's why gossip is such a terrible thing it's a spirit that wants to jump from one to another to bind the people in unbelief we read this here Jesus comes to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue in as much as they are astonished and said whence hath this man uh whence hath this man this wisdom and these Mighty works is not the is not this The Carpenter's son is not his mother called Mary and his Brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all uh with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but Jesus said unto them a Propet is not without honor saving his own country and his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief so that Spirit was so strong among all the people that he couldn't do here's the Lord Of Glory now he couldn't do many mighty works there because the spirit was causing a Unity among the people but it wasn't a right kind of unity it was an antichrist Unity but it was a it was a demon power of unbelief on the people are you are you following me you see this principle there's power the demons have power if there's the numbers if they get more than one to agree with each other you know it tries to reinforce itself and so that's why we must be very careful about what we have what we have in common right you'll see people who have depression they'll gather together people of an anxiety they'll gather together lust spirits will gather together you see this in groups now I'm not looking anyone in particular okay but this is just from what I've seen around the place Spirits congregate go gossipers they have their club right they may different age different background you know different um you know family status or whatever more but yet that spirit will cause people to congregate together why because that Spirit those Spirits are calling out for help especially when you come to a place like camp or church demons are terrified because they know the power of the Holy Ghost they've been cast out before somewhere else some other time they know what it's like to be defeated so they say so they Say Never Again I'm not going to allow this to happen to me again they wise up to things right but you see it's wonderful with the message of the hour the devil is exposed completely he says nervousness is nothing for God to heal lady you believe he will heal nervous conditions there's just a whole group of this people suffering with the same thing how many out there are suffering with nervous condition Hold Your Hand see what I mean there's too many to call but them demons are calling one to another black streaks running everywhere the devil knows he's defeated he knows if he can only get those people if then people will only believe God it'll leave them right now every one of them and they'll all be made well so there's a there's an attraction between spirits to try and keep the people bound with that Spirit right that's why that's why you've got to you know you can't you can't entertain see people think they can manage a spirit they think they can you know they think they can manage it but I said you cannot contain the uncontainable you know because of demon like like for example here's Amon here in the beginning that thing I don't know how long he had that Obsession for and that Spirit would feed his imagination feed his desires and you know but then at the right opportunity it came out and did what it wanted to do but then when it was done he hated her because he would have realized what he's done right that's why so so the devil perverted it with a love but then when the spirit left he he hated her because the reality of the thing set in right and then that's what happens is like people you know you take people you take Spirits like pedophilia and all those kind of evil you know uh people who are predators they will that spirit will be in them it'll come out it'll do what it's done the person will even feel sorry but if they haven't completely repented and died out to the thing it will stay right there and it'll be hidden away and then that person say I'll never do it again but they're trying to contain the uncontainable they'll try and reason it away well I'm a Believer I've done this I've done that but it's still there right and then another maybe years later will come out again it'll do it thing it'll go back in see it's Spirits look for opportunities but if they can get you to realize no this is just you or your nature or something you're raised with then they can hide but if you really hate that thing then you can be free of it see it's easy it's easy to hate anxiety yep there's nothing positive being anxious you know it's easy it's easy to hate depression to be down to hate being down there's no I don't see any positive emotion that would keep that thing in a person right but if you take lust you take any kind of lying or gospel or something there's something that that Spirit gets a thrill when it's expressed so it puts a positive emotion in someone for it to stay there you're following me you know that and that's why people are not truly free is because they think that thing is one not a spirit and two they reason they they allow reason to keep it there and they like the emotion it produces because if people really hated that Spirit they'd be free of it right but because they like it like it even just a little bit it's still got a toe hold in their Spirit you know that's why it's a big difference between when someone really means business with God God comes on the scene if someone says they mean business with God but they don't actually in their heart then then it's still going to be there right so it's when it's when it's when you really mean it in your heart then you can be free of something right but if you just vocalize it but you still like it and the same you want to entertain that thing then it's going to then it's going to stay right CU some people you know no doubt they say well I've prayed about this thing I want it to go but do you really want it to go I'm not looking at anyone particular I'm just saying you see we can't have any positive emotion towards any demon power any thought of the devil anything we can't think there's anything good of it right because that keeps the door open okay see so demons call out for help they're trying to and that's why that's why you see people who have the same I'm not saying people will demon possess but Spirits can bother people and they'll begin to congregate with each other cuz that's actually demons calling for help I'll stay by you you stay by me and that's how Fellowship is formed around those things so we can't we can't allow we can't think we can manage sin we can't think that we can't think I'll be all right I'll get over this I'll mature I'll grow up no it'll just become nastier right you take a child who's got a vindictive streak and it's more than a personality but there's a evil in it what what has that become if it's not dealt with they'll kill someone they'll do something they'll terrorize someone they'll you know they'll be a bully they'll manipulate spiritually all those kind of things because it's it's matured now it was just oh it's just a little kid no but there's something in that that needs to be something needs to that that child needs help needs some love needs some care needs some guidance or something that they can be free of that thing you see so I'm just going to I'm going to just finish with one more so we you must be careful well well I'm just going to say I'm winding up because I don't say that but I'm going to say I'm just winding up I want you to think about this you're known by The Company You Keep okay birds of a feather flock together what do you Fellowship on you know normally people who are in sin try and get other people to join them right because a burden shed is a burden half so if you're not the only person that Spirit wants to spread right so what are you what are we fellowshipping about what are we sharing what's on the inside that wants to come out you know are we wanting to I know this is a young people and Young At Heart Meeting but you know do we the if there's like say we have I don't know pornographic Spirit L spirit I know what it is are you trying to share that with other people or gossip or control or manipulation or whatever it is is that thing motivating your life or is Jesus Christ motivating your life birds of a feather flock together okay so are we letting are we letting are we letting Spirits reinforce themselves in our lives are we saying Lord I want nothing to do with that whom the son has set free is free indeed amen so Ammon Ammon allowed that thing to grip him so much that it was just looking for an outlet and it came out and look at the Carnage it caused and even David's father was so blindsided by it David imagine him he he actually um he actually because he didn't think Ammon would be this way he allowed this he actually told Tam to go there so it's a it's a terrible thing but I just want to leave it there you cannot contain sin you cannot contain the devil you cannot rule him he will rule you and he'll pop his head out do his thing go back and torment you like that but he wants you to to like it that's why he perverts emotions and and desires and all these things I'm just going to finish there okay but I want you to think about it what are you fellowshipping over when you're on this with each other what you talking about what are you igging each other on to do I hope it's Godly I hope you're provoking one another to Good Works not sinful things in secret I hope that okay so let's have the musicians this afternoon there's a reaction you'll get an opposite Rea you there's an action there's a reaction sin is deceiving you can't outsmart the devil that's why the Holy Ghost is here that's why Jesus is here you just let him you just let him take over your life you say man I'm try to contain this thing for years but the Lord can take it from you if you want him to expose the devil that's the main thing to do and hate it with everything within you because the devil what he does it's like someone trying to I don't know if Christine had this dream on I can't remember someone did it's like someone in a pit it's like stuck in sin they try and climb their way out and they finally at the top think finally I'm free then the devil just pushes them back in it's like someone who thinks they're finally free of it it's been long enough since it happened before now I'm okay but then that thing's still there to push them back in what about letting letting that thing totally be broken that it can't it can't bother you see the see the Holy Ghost seals the devil out right you're sealed in he sealed out praise the Lord and if he and if you're sealed in then you have the strong man of the house the Lord Jesus himself on the inside of the inside who's there to fight the battle and drive that thing away it's not you trying to manage things no God manages real well and he's in the extermination process extermination business amen so let's um let's stand um this afternoon um that's what I felt to say you might think that's a bit heavy but life his life you know the devil's not playing games so let's not play games either amen so let's just bow our heads and then um then I'm going to turn the service over you bro if that's right amen let's pray let's just let's just bow our heads shall we let's all close our eyes bow our heads and if you want to slip your hand up to the Lord say Lord I don't want to try and manage the devil try and think I can control him I don't want this habit I don't want this way I don't want the spirit to motivate me I want your Holy Ghost to motivate me Lord I don't want to be I I don't want to associate with people because of spirits calling out but I want to be associated with your holy ghost that the people that I that I'm associated with my friends the birds that I flock with Are Holy Ghost filled amen real Believers and that's what I'm interested in and amen so let's um let's just pray gracious father you see the hands that are raised Lord Jesus I pray father that you would touch each life dear God you see the needs and the desires and father I pray you just take these words Lord that Lord and and and and we would see dear God that we don't have to be an Ammon we don't have to be someone who's so fixated on evil and that that it consumes their lives that they they allow that Spirit to to take us down a very dark and wicked path Lord we're not called to be that father and so I want to pray for each one here Lord Jesus oldest to the youngest Lord may we never be like that dear God father I pray Lord if there's anyone here whose spirit is bothering them tor ing them trying to motivate them to do evil things father I pray that you would just put it in their hearts Lord Jesus that Lord that they hate that thing and not just that but Lord that they that your blood is more than able to cleanse them and may they be willing to die out completely to that thing father may you grant it in the name of Jesus Christ I pray that Lord every Spirit would be exposed father the devil can't hide anywhere Lord Jesus that we'd all just be completely free Lord and we know that the enemy enemy wants to get into our lives get into our spirits and cause Havoc oh God but father Lord if he tries to do that Lord I Lord I want to plead your blood over each one here father in the name of Jesus Christ that Lord that that that that how we speak to one another Lord what we what we encourage one another to do may they may it be Godly things may it be wholesome things father may it not be any wickedness Lord anything evil Lord father may you grant it in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray that the light of your Holy Spirit would shine on every heart now Lord God that all reasoning would be put to one side that we would Lord as David said search my heart oh Lord create in me a clean heart oh God and renew right Spirit Within Me Lord father may you grant it for each one Lord Jesus that you would Lord if there's something in us that needs to be dealt with You' put a finger on it dear God and we would not we would not rest we'd not be satisfied until that thing is completely rooted out of our Lives Grant it father just takes your real heartfelt repentance Lord so may you grant it I commit each one into your hands we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all amen if
