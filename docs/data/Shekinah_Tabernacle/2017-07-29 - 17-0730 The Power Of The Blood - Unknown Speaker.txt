thank you brother John musicians amen well it's a glorious day amen declan's getting baptized today hallelujah amen praise the Lord he's been wanting to for some time and today is the day that means a straight up the service I was going to go to our regular spot down to the motorway turn right okay going up towards up a height you go over the river once and it's the first reserve on the left but we'll all convoy together so all go so no one will get lost I mean but it's a glorious day Alleluia let's just go - it's got a first Timothy chapter 2 and we're going to read a couple of scriptures and then we're going to go to so first Timothy two and five and six and then we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 18 so first Timothy - five and six says it says for there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus it gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time and then we're going to go to Hebrews 12 and we read verse from 18 down to verse 24 it says for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched that burned with fire nor unto darkness a blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they had heard and treated that that word should not be spoken to them any more this being of when Moses when the children of Israel went to Mount Sinai but for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much the beast touch the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through the dark and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem into an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel I mean God bless you all you may have your seats today in the Friends of the Lord and I wonder this morning I want to continue on my thought from to a degree from from last Sunday speaking about being worthy and we finished last Sunday with revelations chapter 5 where the book was taken and all those in heaven said thou art worthy to go hast thou has redeemed us out of every kindred nation and tongue by thy blood and made us kings and priests to God and I want to focus on this morning because you know there's always that battle and maybe if I repeat myself a little bit from from times past I pray you'd forgive me for that but we must understand that the blood of Jesus Christ is more powerful than we can even fathom I mean we're we're by one offering by one moment in time God shed his blood upon the earth for you and I and what was the life of God was released out of those blood cells and it was now through his word as quickened unto you I mean with that life can come unto you and it and it doesn't just save your soul but there's a power that's been released through the blood which will change your mortal bodies amen so it's an incredible thing where where once mankind we understand by by the by the sin that was done in the garden that man was once he was here dominion over the earth but then he became a slave to Satan he became a slave yo Satan became the Prince of the power of the year you know you read from Ephesians chapter 2 and so we were once slaves but we understand that man was never made to be a slave to the devil I mean we were never made to be his his subjects but we were made to be sons and daughters of God we're made to be the bride of Jesus Christ joint heirs with Christ hallelujah so that is what man was ordained to be we were attained to have dominion over this earth but because of sin and because of that sin nature came came into humanity and so we became slaves to that sin nature so man nowadays he becomes a slave to lust or or drinking or drugs or smoking or fame or money or woman aware of it as man becomes slave to that because we are all born with a fallen nature they meant but now but through the blood of Jesus Christ he doesn't just patch us up but he makers a new creation it means of the nature that we should have received in the beginning we received that divine nature hallelujah but through that divine nature now breath just just let's just have Church today I mean we are free I mean the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin I mean you don't have to be a slave and you say well I'm free rejoicing you're freed you know it's like a weapon if you really know what the weapon can do you know if you don't know what the weapon can do you may be a bit scared to use it you imagine you know a nuclear bomb is not actually that big it can be like in a briefcase and imagine if you said take this into the enemy's camp and put it down you say well well what does briefcase yeah this what's it gonna do it's gonna wipe it out how's it gonna wipe it out I'll show you you know but even though I said no just just go just take it trust me you may have some doubts but then if you see it in action you say oh I'm gonna take the city don't worry I'll set it off when you're far away you'll be okay you know that's that's the same thing with the blood we have a record of the victory of the blood down through even in the Old Testament there was a victory it's just under the blood of bulls and goats for those victories manifested I mean time and time again God was proving himself hallelujah then you come into the New Testament era glory amen and God just keeps showing himself improving himself so we know that this bomb works we know that this weapon works we know what it can do when you take when when God can take a redeemed man take the profit of God man born and since shaped an iniquity come to world speaking lives just like you and I a man in any case surrender his life over except the blood of Jesus Christ God comes and fills them and then he places them into his position his adoption where he receives the sword in his hand on sunset man in the word you know the opening of the word and and God proofs for his ministry every devil was defeated amen nature had to obey his voice death had to get had to flee amen life had to come back into people that were dead hallelujah witchcraft was cast down I mean the nomination was was revealed to what it was hallelujah amen this was proven in a man because God wanted to show you and I this is what the blood does I mean this is what my victory does I want to show it to you in this generation I mean so it's not just a you know it's not just maybe something that in our minds it was 2,000 years ago but it comes forward to our generation and God shows you now this is what I can do this is what I can do through me this is what is done I mean because remember the challenge isn't actually you know the challenge now is the question comes up does this work does it do what it says it does because if it doesn't we should find what does work but if it does work we should cherish it we should rejoice in it and we should use it amen so it's been shown to work Alleluia now God has told us in his word he said you'll be made like me I'll make you into my image you'd be partakers of the divine nature now so the nature that Adam had before the fall we would receive and it would be that man and as member this body has to be redeemed right we are still in a fallen body but God and his power can put his life in us that the Spirit in us makes the subject to the life in us I mean that we are no longer slaves to this guy but we become loved prisoners to Jesus Christ the sinner and that life in us gives us overcoming power well the man says if you want to yo how do you overcome just keep life about you hallelujah now so brother Bram he he begins to speak about this is in the breach he's you know if you ever listened to the breach meant you're the breach between the seven churches and the seven seals god hiding himself and simplicity you should go listen to those sermons because it's not just a preamble for this is what the seals are but he's laying in some very important things because he says in the breach he says he says now when a person is struck with disease aches and pain one thing they wasn't they wasn't that way but they groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're groaning and they're trying to get back to where they was when they had health and when nature and people as the Bible said are groaning it shows there's something that's that they're not in there ought to be condition their fallen from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see but of course we know it was eternal life that they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of antimony who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam an animal wouldn't die before Adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be sons and daughters of God so there's a longing when you're sick I'm just basically reiterating what he said but if you're sick there's something in you saying this is not how I should be I should be well I remember what it's like to be well and it's the same thing even even in a spiritual sight when there's something and you saying there's more to life than us there's more to just how things are there has shown you that your fallen from somewhere your fallen from something and your something and you crying up I don't want to be in this decrepit yo lost and undone state I want to go back to what I should be and that's God trying to get your attention saying saying before the foundation world you're in my mind amen and I thought of yours as made in my image sitting at my right hand join us with me how Lewis it is a crying earth is that there's a crying in your heart there must be a God to meet or you know that's because you actually fell from somewhere amen and God is willing to open your eyes and lift you back up to where you should be because remember Satan was near I'm just going to repeat myself you know I hope you don't mind Satan was made as he's an angel an angel is a servant right a son or daughter is not a servant it's different category so all the hordes of hell were made servants because they were angels but they fell from their first estate I'm in our cast down into darkness but they were made to be servants angels the servants servants and not sons and daughters of the king servants can never become royal family they could you know take in the modern sense the royal family could adopt you awry but you go back into the genetics to the of us we are not related to them right but those who are born into the family have the lineage or the DNA of the parent amen and it's the same thing with you and I we were never made to be servants we were not mate and especially not servants to fallen angels I mean but we are made as sons and daughters and we do not become sons and daughters the Bible says because you are sons he said for the spirit and here we cry my father my father Abba Father hallelujah so we are not made to be servants we are made to be sons and daughters and this is the age where everything is coming back into a straight position amen where where when when the land took the book and revelations chapter five and he looses the seals he begins to place everything Satan you're under the feet of the bride bride you're at my right hand fullest virgin your hair Church you're here Great Hall at the oh he's placing everything in its position Jesus Christ is high above all else he's a lord of glory a menace why the greatest were the greatest revelations as Jesus Christ is supreme deity I mean he is the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last how lujah there's only one God amen so now so the message places everything where it's meant to be I mean so so the bright your joint is with Christ you being predestinated to come into that position hallelujah and then so now what happens is through that word as you receive that word I mean it begins you begin to move whether you realize I'm not talking about moving from one country to another or you know one place I'm talking about spiritually you begin to move because of one time you're a slave but then you hear the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so faith comes into your heart and then the things you were once bound by they're under your feet I mean because you begin to ascend hallelujah the bride is ascending in the stage a mint and a few yo you say well I don't feel like I'm going too far have more faith in the blood of Jesus Christ amen because it's by his work yes by his blood yes by his offering hallelujah we will be where we will be a mint that is the only way remember I read the quote from me from the church age book it is not blood it's not the blood and your good conduct or your blood in your works it's only the blood I mean but your conduct is because you love him that's why we live certain your your the way we do and so now we have been in this out okay let's just read Hebrews I mean Ephesians chapter 2 because I want to actually just basically I want to say what I've just said to you is in the Bible okay you got to find it in here and I just want to throw out some things and that sounds neat and we get excited but where is it in the word because in the hard times you can go back and say god this is what you see I mean it's like the message you find the message in the Bible because the message is not another gospel of Jesus Christ it reveals Christ in here I mean that's why this is our absolute hallelujah and God sent a prophet to give us a quick interpretation of the word because now if we have the incorrect interpretation of the word the devil has nothing he can hold against us I mean because we do not have his doctrine we do not believe in three separate people in the Godhead or some false baptism or whatever they may believe we don't believe in those things and so the devil can't say I have a claim on those people well maybe come to that later because those things have been struck off in this age now Ephesians two and one and you had the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins according in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation and times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others let's just stop there so one time we were slay we were all born this way that's why I just said we were all slaves because the full of nature we received we were like this but then that's not the end of the story Alleluia first fought but God who is rich in mercy for his great lover and he has loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ESA and hath this is what he has done and hath raised us up together and made us O Lord I want to sit and hear me places he makes you do it he makes you suddenly everything places because he elevates like in stir was elevated to be the queen the king put her there she didn't put her itself there he put her there I lose the same thing with us let's raise us tomatoes sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus then the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace ye are saved through faith and that is not of yourselves and as the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that now just change the way to I make it better that I should walk in them Alleluia so we can see here now this is whoa let's just keep reading here who likes to read the Bible because normally brother I meet ya brother Armand sees I need an in scripture cuz otherwise he gets too small I'm just gonna keep reading I'm sorry cuz it's all good but this shows you now cuz Paul is telling you this is what you were you're a slave you were but he quickened you he made you alive and faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God right and so now after you hear the word it's quicken to you you no longer a slave cuz you began arise up of other thing that oppresses you wherefore remember that you've been in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the Covenant of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath brought who had made both one and it's broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make in himself of twain one you men so making peace and that he might reconcile unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace you which are afar off and to them that and I for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father so he makes it very very clear we were aliens we were separated go back a bit further than a chapter we were slaves but now we are now by the blood of Jesus Christ we were we were aliens not even part of the Commonwealth not even part of the covenants right we weren't even part of it now this is verse 12 we were strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world what is ultimately the Covenant of God I'll give you eternal life amen walk on streets of gold I mean that's ultimately the government all of it is eternal life you will receive eternal life so beforehand we were not even in the picture but now we are in the picture hallelujah and so this is glorious but then you see well how old this was done by the blood of Jesus Christ it was done by the block it's not by your it's not by Europe your even your desire it's by his blood I meant but he puts the desire knee because he wants you to know I died for you remember before yo when he went to Calvary he didn't go up there thinking well people maybe feel sorry for me one day you know right to my songs about me and now you know and they'll feel and then they'll believe me and follow me no he knew he was he's gonna pay a ransom we're it there and first Timothy he was to ransom for us but you got to understand it wasn't you know when when he went up to pay that ransom he didn't buy him with the devil beforehand saying you know you're the devil and saying you have to do this and I'll give you this know God actually set thee set the price in the beginning the day you eat there all the day you'll die so I had to be a lie was the price and so Jesus had to give us life to pay the ransom I mean to set us free hallelujah and he knew he knew you'd be here in this day when he was back there carrying that carrying that cross up that hill that day hallelujah he knew you'd be here and so when and when he was carrying the cross up there he had your son upon you he had your failings here your humanity power he had your carnal nature hallelujah he had your you know you know don't look at yourself remember this is not he's made us worthy you know I know it's been it's it's so embedded into people we have to obtain and everything we don't have to obtain you don't sit an exam you can now get in the rapture who you are a plus okay you can you can go who got a C are you going with tribulation that doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way he made us worthy amen by his blood by one offering white offering hallelujah so now he remember before the foundation of the world we read there in Hebrews chapter 12 the names written in heaven there's being of the Lamb's Book of Life this is where we have come to where we would begin to understand that before the foundations of world God had a book of names a book of the Lamb's Book of Life not just everyone who would be on the earth and then AZ blood out for the Lamb's Book of Life right so he so he had you there recorded and then so when he went to Calvary he was he was shedding his blood upon the earth to redeem the names in the book they meant to redeem those that he foreknew he went to Calvary to redeem them so wasn't just the Old Testament Saints it here is redeeming that it already died in the faith but those in the future who would be alive and remain I mean so he wasn't just looking back to Adam because he had to because under the blood of bulls and goats that's why they went to paradise is because the blood of bulls and goats just covered their sin right it just cut it didn't do away with it it didn't transfer it to the original one who initiated the whole thing it just covered it and now waiting in Paradise until someone could come and clear every accusation against them that then they could have sent they were waiting there and so that's why they had to wait there in Paradise but then when Jesus died now it says when he arose many of the Saints arose with them because in the Old Testament there's wise and foolish virgin as well didn't say all the saints arose but many arose Matthew 27 right so it's the wise part of the bride and the Old Testament there rose with them okay and so now because they're because their dick was now I wasn't just covered by the blood of bulls and goats it was wiped clean hallelujah it was gone so now there's nothing holding him because the devil if he could hold on to you he's got you you can't you can't go up if he's got a claim on you right he you can't but if there's no claim against you that's why we can sing there's nothing holding me here I met in the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour remember Dean we've had we've come down seven church ages in the beginning you just read it's not very far into the book of Acts acts 15 I believe it is false doctrines already coming to try and among the church they had already begun to fall from where where where they were in Pentecost 120 in the upper room God came and filled them they were they were burst into the kingdom but then as time went by people came in among the believers professing to be believers but they're never full birth because they are trying to bring think yo that you're the Old Testament laws you have to become a Jew before you can become a Christian and I try to bring these things and so these people were were not completely birthed so the devil had already begin to try and creep in with yo with false doctrine and so by doing that eventually it went from there down into the Dark Ages where the devil had a total claim you know you can just go on Wikipedia and you can see the evolutions of Trinitarian doctrine you can read about it just by reading what the early church fathers safe you can go read it and so it evolved from one God and three officers to three separate people as one God but to have a person you have to be have a personality you've got to have a identity right but look here they are Israel the LORD thy God is one amen and so now so he so he brought it and the and then you go read history they change the baptism from in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost there's the Lord Jesus Christ they change it to just the titles of God Father Son Holy Ghost and instead of immersing them in water which what the would baptize means is to immerse they just sprinkle and then they sprinkle babies I didn't and don't even worry about else anymore and it was just total darkness what happens Satan that claims but through that God still had some true believers all the way down through I mean because you took you know I saw a documentary on the history of the Bible and Columba I better get the church as messages wrong but Columba was the was the church age messenger to the thought Iron Age the Dark Age and he but so he actually died before that Age started but brother Brahim says speaking the Ephesian AG said the ministry that affects the age the most is the light as the messenger to the age and so now Columbus found in a Bible School in Scotland and the historian said for the next nine hundred years the vast majority of all the evangelical work in Europe came from their Bible school who's that the ministry that affected the age of the most right and then through out of that eventually that influenced John Wycliffe who was the first one to translate the Bible into English under the reign of Henry the eighth and in his teachings influenced John Huss and in John HUS what is being burnt at the stake sit in a hundred years a man will rise up with these same things and you'll not be able to destroy him and a hundred years later John Luther I mean Martin Luther raised up this is believers coming all the way down through he he raised up with the just shall live by faith in the river lake I mean the Reformation was on a mint but Satan still had claims on them because Martin Luther brought out a lot of what the Catholics belief right and then John Weasley off that brought out even more you mean I mean sane he brought out other false things but then the truth was becoming more and more than the fossils becoming less and less and so now they all died in the faith but there had to be a clearing of the deed they had to be a clearing of them as well even though if their sins were done away but Satan could still say I have them I have them because they believe false things and so now we come down don't be there like we'll be there okay don't get in your mind they won't be there they'll be there we'll see John you're Martin Luther will see John Huss will see white cliff will see Wesley and you're all those ones will meet them we'll be up there they'll be part of the same body the others have the same body we are just different season you see and so now here say so now we've come down to this last age where they without us should not be made perfect or complete so there has to be a people that will possess the full promise where the devil has no claim against them whatsoever they're made in the image of Jesus Christ right and when that body comes to us the whole body comes into the entire comes to us maturity whatever God dictates his maturity in the individual in the dead in Christ or race amen so now there has to be a clearing of everything that can be held against us and so now that's why it's so incredibly important when the when the book became open because before the book became open you know theologians would probe at it and say I think it means this and I think it says this and because it was the intelligence of man trying to understand the scripture they may have it 99% right there 100 there was the one percent that was wrong right that's why it's why brother Barron part of the ministry of Malachi 4 was to take all the loose ends he calls them and bring it all together right because man probed at it godly meant but they couldn't get the whole thing cuz it was in a prophetic office that God could anoint to open the word hey you're following me just right and that's why brother Bram could take he he read a lot of things he reads an Icee and fathers poutier all those your the histories here eclairs Larkins books and all different things and he would even reference those things but it was if you go read Larkins book on the church ages there's parts that are totally wrong but this parts that are right why was happening now God brought Elijah okay I'll go back to the we just gotta jump back to Kings 18 seeking Kings 18 I believe it us let's go there because these things I may be totally in the wrong place just got first Kings anything now this is this is the purpose of the spirit of Elijah I'm just I want you to understand these things this is all to do with the power of the blood you say why are you going down this way talk about altars and Baylor and Elijah it's all part of the power of the blood because God has to bring a word now that eradicate anything but the devil to say they believe this wrong I can hold this against them and the spirit of Elijah is sent to restore the people back to the original right so we have the if you're a believer in this word today you have the faith of the fathers you have been your heart has been turned back to the faith of the fathers I meant this is what this message does to turn you back to the original faith not some other faith now now this is on Mount Carmel and Elijah has challenged the prophets of bale let's just go down to let's go down to verse 30 of our first kings 18 now God has told Elijah go to Mount Carmel challenge the prophets of Bale do this and I'll answer by fire to prove I'm the real God no but you see Elijah he came and do you have it there verse verse 30 and Elisha said unto all the people says after the prophets of Baal tried to call call bountiful call fire down of course nothing happens even though bail was they believe was the god of fire but then you see Elijah he doesn't build a new altar he says so and I just said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down so he he repaired so they because an altar as a approach to God as it not so now that the correct altar they should have been used it had fallen into disrepair why what had happened there trying to worship something else and so now the spirit of Elijah is there on Mount Carmel and he's directed rebuild the altar that was originally there so place the word exactly how it should be so well how does that work today well other churches say you sprinkle babies in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost in there there they go they'll be in heaven or just say a sinner's prayer you know and get sprinkled some other way you don't even need to be baptized or you know that's not the right approach Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent you know be baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so that is the approach that is the right way to come and so now it took the spirit of Elijah right to come and anoint that you're showing the word this is the right approach amen that's why he says if you know the first thing you've got to recognize as God has not through God as one you can't even get the first base with God if you think he's through okay so now so he rebuilt the altar he put the sacrifice on it right you know he had put the wood he put the sacrifice and he and he got told them to build water I mean pour pour water upon the sacrifice and then finally he says now in verse 36 after this was all done and it came to pass at the time of the evening sacrifice and we're in the evening time I'm just touching some very highlights here that Elisha the prophet came here and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac in Israel and of Israel not Jacob of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am my servant and that I've done all these things at thy word hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again this is the purpose of spirit of Elijah to turn the people back right and then when when John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah to turn the people from the Old Testament traditions to receive Christ amen and we know from the rear know all Bible readers understand that this for Elijah would come in the end time to turn the hearts of the people back to the original book of Acts faith okay and this is where we are I meant so that was the purpose of it to turn their hearts back again and so now if their hearts have been turned back to the original then the enemy should have been defeated by them right because God told Israel if you if you just separate yourself unto me don't worship the gods of the nations around you don't even really don't even intermingle with them but cleveland's of the love that God then you'll possess the whole land then you'll be successful then one will chase a thousand to ten thousand right but if you do those things if you start to worship other things and you know then what happened in the book of Judges they begin to worship idols in the enemy came in they were slaves and God seemed to deliverer they kicked out all the idol worship and everything and they had victory but then idols came back in again they became slaves of an enemy again the cycle repeated because God was showing now if you compromise on the word if your heart is not separated unto me completely then you become a slave again you following me but then now if you if you keep in your because it's the heart where is your what is I could say where is your heart where's your affections towards amen because if your heart is totally sold that upon God he is your all and all amen and then you'll be victorious amen but then if your heart is on other things you know I was listening us listening to what was a sermon called pride brother pyramids in nineteen fifty fifty six and he's preaching assuming pride and I don't have any of the quotes here but he he goes into speaking of Jesus Jesus's feet thing unwashed he speaking of Methodists campground you should go listen to it listen to the whole thing don't listen to listen to the whole thing and so and and he begins to relate how Simon the you know the Pharisee invites Jesus and Jesus always goes to where he's invited and and how you know he would talk about how they wouldn't you know wash the feet of the people because they would walk down those streets they're Palestine and the dung of the animals everything would get onto their feet their sandals and so they'd wash their feet and that anoint them and they do certain things in that Bentham welcome but Jesus wasn't he was invited but he didn't but no one gave him you know no one looked after him when he came to the door and he just sat there in the corner yeah this is a Pharisees house they mean to be believers in Jehovah yeah right they mean to be believers in God this is not an atheist house to be believers and then he begin to talk about Pharisees how they're just actors outwardly just displaying something now if someone's just a Pharisee you know their heart is somewhere else their heart is on the pride of how great they can look like a bunch of peacocks they can you know appear to be all humble and yielded and whatever more but they people can become proud and just that we're just going on a Segway for a little bit I hope you're with me hold on okay so he's talking about those things you're a bunch of Pharisees and you know but then he said Jesus was uncomfortable he was sitting in this feast he was put in the corner with unwashed feet you know the stink of the day on him and everything he wasn't like the rest of them made welcome and Jesus felt uncomfortable he was a man like us mention that the Lord of glory was invited to a house and he felt uncomfortable because he always comes to where he's invited amen any-any was saying it's the same thing we invite them we invite them but we don't make him welcome and here was Hill as a woman who wasn't even invited to the feast you should just just go listen to it whatever you do here's your homework class for the week go listen to the sermon fried the whole thing whatever you do and then so now she she's there yo she gets the alabaster box anointest feet begins to cry washes his feet anoints his feet dries his feet with her tears yo she's all beside herself she doesn't care what anyone else thinks about it but here she takes these feet where Redemption was going to come out of the wounds amen eternal life was going to be released by the by the piercing of my hands and my feet it was prophesied she was taking these feet that her redemption was going to come out of you understand what I'm saying because the life was going to come out because he was the lamb and she was doing him a service worshiping him and here's the same feet and these people said I won't even wash your feet you're not welcome basically we invite you but you just go sit over there and Jesus felt uncomfortable and I was thinking when I heard that I thought Lord I want you always to be comfortable amen in my life here in our homes ever Lord may you never feel uncomfortable by what I do amen because we have to understand there is great power and I see it a while ago there was great power and humility because humility will get you what you need pride God resists the proud a mint and God is way stronger than you so you can never win if you're proud but if you're humble he giveth grace to the humble amen so here is this woman it wasn't even invited to the feast and she received what they should have got mentioned his Pharisees they knew this Bible real well they should have recognized because you know he come the wise men into Jerusalem we've seen us down these have come to worship Him where is he born King of the Jews they're all like what's this going on and then here at us the your ask the scribes where would he be born or basically here you know and you know the city's in a bit of an uproar cause he company's wise been asking the things and then the wise men go down to basically him they find them as soon as they come out from outside of Jerusalem I see a star again and their God rejoice and they and they find them and they give him the gifts then they leave then he recognizes he must have really been born they win another way so he sent soldiers to killed two you know two and under and then the great and then you even go back before that his John the Baptist and before he's born his father's in the temple you know these things would have been talked about yeah they weren't just it wouldn't just be not happened than everyone forgot about it you know his his John the Baptist father Zacharias and the temple and the altar of incense you're gonna hit you're gonna have you know you're gonna bring forth famine he's gonna come forth as you know spirit of Elijah and he's going to turn the hearts of the children I mean the father's to the children season Luke 1:17 he didn't believe the angels message he comes out he can't speak what's happened he's seen a vision of an angel and finally John's born you know and and then Elizabeth you know John's mum says call him John and then of course you know they say well shouldn't we call him Sakurai's because there's no John in your family and then he picks up John I mean Zechariah picks up the writing tablet call his name John and immediately his mouth comes open and he begins to praise the Lord or whatever happened and then now so those things would have been spoken about yes but every now and then now here comes Mary here comes Mary with Jesus eight days old into the temple they can't afford a lamb they take pictures and she's she said you're there all the other woman are there with their great big nice gowns on their babies couldn't be circumcised yeah the male's gonna be circumcised and here's this one maybe Raptor just a swaddling cloth poor looking a little old girl you know just with this baby no she was young but just just poor poor family you know and here comes he comes a few go was named Simon God told him I you're gonna see the Messiah before you die do you think he would have kept that quiet I'm out now this is where we do you think thank you no he would he would have been excited cuz here he was he was a devout man and and he would have said God told me I'm not gonna die til I see the Lord's Christ I'm gonna see the Peace of us are all coming how they are gonna see the Messiah so here he was it's something happen do you think God you're with God as his always his presence I meant here was the word the lamb became flesh he ought to be an atmosphere and as a baby he made you walk into that manger just it was just a cave on the side of a hill the problem it wasn't a nice fancy thing that you know you see the manger scenes it wasn't like that well you know this the animals everything imagine walking in the your your step into there is it presence you think God wasn't there hallelujah I'm in the Angels you mentioned the security detail on that place amen you got the door you take that legion year-round that yo you walk in there but it made a very different kind of not just cuz he was a baby in a manger God became flesh and you a son is given a child was born hallelujah and it's annachi now he's eight days old going into the temple and then Simon begins to rejoice because God says this is him Alleluia we don't have time to read it but go read the start of look I read the start of look and then comes was it enter the blind prophet is she stoned blind faith the Spirit of God says stand up begins to guide her through the crowd there's a lot of people in the temple guides are through right so we're the Messiah's amen those things were that wasn't a normal day that wasn't a normal baby circumcision day that's very different see he comes and then now Jesus is 12 he goes he goes to Jerusalem with his family it's a little boy who's 12 we have any 12 girl boys here hope your girls can you stand up okay hey comes it comes thank you said about imagine here he comes in you know you see this little boy looking at this great big temple and then maybe why the priesthood you know so what do you think yeah weird you from and then what comes out of his mouth he'd have some question about the Bible what does it mean this what do you think this and you know facing the wood because he is the wood I mean no doubt this priest would've gone hey Levi come here yeah that we're gonna talk it in that makes you like go and talk to the it would be the high priest all these ones and he is the word talking about the word to these people who should know the word and they're amazed now that didn't happen every day you remember last year that what's your name Jesus you know that I'm not trying to be silly but you know that wouldn't happen to every day and now here he comes he's not 12 he's entered into his ministry hallelujah where the angel the Covenant came and dwelt in a mama yo when he was baptized hallelujah here he is in Simon's house don't wash his feet sit over there he feels uncomfortable stranger someone who should have known Pharisee should have known no doubt you know if he really knew who that was give him the highest place let me wash his feet oh god I want to wash your feet hallelujah right but he didn't know he's blinded to it but here we are now we've just got a total remember cuz in him he's walking around and me here's the price I'm the ransom hallelujah I'm gonna take this earth off Satan's grip hello I'm gonna loosen from his from his hands I'm gonna place man black where they should be hallelujah having dominion he's walking around it's in his veins he doesn't carry it in a bag it's his very life hallelujah and he looks down at people brother branham at the internet service campground two people and he says anyone here who wants to stand up receive this Jesus not one they seized under vision I can see darkness over people because listen to it that sermon influences that I quoted from a few a few Sundays ago he said yo he makes an altar call I think there's maybe one or two he says you've done the most horrible thing and he begins to call out God just forgives us sure this one's got this and the one next you've got this wrong and this one just go virtually just down a row in a row and the whole altars just tech to people I think to me I think they came a bit late we shouldn't need I remember you say I'm going to bring it back to where what you know what we're talking about but we shouldn't need some great big fantastic they were looking there we want to see discernment should be more than they said Lord I want to hear your work I want to hear the words of life and not just hear them but change my life I'm gonna be impacted I want to be just changed by your word amen and so now here we are and sometimes we think we need something big I don't feel it who's there who's been there meaning I don't feel it today I don't feel like I'm a Christian I don't feel like I'm victorious forget what you feel forget what you feel amen the word says that you are the word says I've made you worthy the word says you are the redeemed here comes the bride spotless wash hallelujah pure more pure than anything you can think of over this world maintenance image holy hallelujah and you're in that category that's you that's what you've been made I don't say if only one day know now now you are the Bible says now we are the sons of God let's daughter son as a position remember it's an angel now we are not one day will obtain we've obtained are you with me are you but we've got to grow just grow take your land they didn't become or is release just because they're in the promised land there are lights by birth hallelujah and they just possess the promise Amy we are redeemed it's more than a song the bride of Jesus Christ has been redeemed by one offering he doesn't need to come and die again I mean he doesn't need any more blood he paid it in full he made sure he paid it in full you say this is very elementary no free if there's just anchor in your soul a little bit deeper that we don't need to obtain we don't need to you know man wants to evolve into something great amen that man is looking to evolve into something immortal that's why if time will go on man and machine will melt they meant all the science fiction crazy stuff that they thought that's never going to happen it's on the doorstep and because man is trying to become immortal and he knows that this thing will decay if we can't stop this thing aging hey hey it's in the DNA you know gets shorter and shorter called telomeres this these actually proteins on the end get shorter and shorter and shorter and yeah we age so they say well if we can't stop that happening then we'll just put ourselves into machines can't put life into a machine you say well they'll try it says on the Tower of Babel days yeah if you're read in Genesis you'll say God sees if we don't scatter them there is nothing that they don't imagine that you know what they imagine they'll be able to do it sure you read that so Genesis 11:6 this is why this is why God has to bringing in Genesis 11:6 we just need that one verse and God said Behold the people is one know and the Lord said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do that's why God had to scatter them because it was an antichrist system so by Antichrist means thou trying to let's make a name for ourselves this we'd be scattered and what's man want to do now we must become immortal and we have the technology yeah that's why God has to bring it into it all because man is trying so man is trying to evolve itself under a greater thing that's not what we are called to be this is how we it's because remember I said a servant could not become a son or daughter a son a daughter was born right and because you you always were a son or daughter of God you did not become one amen you say no you did not become it by your birth your birth your your new birth I'm talking about your new birth just signifies to you and to God I am a son I mean because God is now placing his hand upon you saying you belong to me you are my son or my daughter and you need to know it because God knows it God knows that Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me and all that come to me all no wise cast out amen so it doesn't matter you say well I don't know if I am a son or daughter just come to him anyway I'm glad see see Jesus I'm so glad you know he puts things in his word to stop the devil try say yeah because the devil comes is are you not a son or daughter well even if that's true I come cuz you see though no wise cast you out hallelujah he says it a mixed breath I'm so glad about that so now but you have to recognize your son or daughter amen and if I'm a son or daughter of God I'm a joint year with Christ amen even you know even my little girls they are my daughters well they're just little babies yet but they're still my daughters and well have they become because they were part my DNA is and then my life is in them Hey they can't train to become like me they just good or bad they become like me if I it's true they don't you know you see facial expressions do you see how they do things you think oh dear atta back in a minute from my side you know but you can't they can't help it you know I'll say this my dad will see this because I lose it but you know I screwed up you know hitting all these little little songs and things and I think man I thought I'm not gonna do that and then as soon as Annalise is born oh it's like a sweat just goes buh and you can't turn it off you know but I'm saying that because it was in me right I came to a certain stage of life where it just happened yeah amen it's the same thing with you here you are wherever you're born whatever decade whatever culture whatever influence but in you and you is something very different than your natural learning and use is you actually have the spiritual DNA father MCS is a gene seed of God that was put in there before the foundation of the world amen so in you was that or is there and then now but then that has to come into the right atmosphere to come to life because what is yo yeah we're born in this world and you know we say well this is my mummy and daddy or this is my daddy or this is my mommy what whatever home we're raised and this is this is me and this is my identity there's my culture you know healings the best or whatever South Africa or whatever country you know you think this is this is my identity but that's not our identity there's nothing to do with it that's yo that is going to fade away this country won't be remembered amen it won't be when the new heavens and new earth to here we may have failed to find the exact coordinates I don't know what this part of the globe will be like but I know it'll be glorious it'll be far better than it is now Alleluia and we might come here for a few well there's no time but a few million years you'll say remember this spot how lujah there may maybe go up the forest lakes remember what happened there he'll go up to Taranaki member what happened there well your River of being and God did something for us it won't be like how it is I won't even be remembered but there's something in us we we come to realize we are not brother brems said he realized he is not the son and daughter of Charles and Ella Brennan even though he was after the flesh but he realized I am a son of God I'm a son of God and so now the blood shows us these things right because God washes us opens our eyes give us an understanding that this is who we really are amen it does mean anything to you you say well I'm going through you know life for such a great transition I used to think just going through teenage time was a big change there's nothing amen you just go back a few years and say man life has changed you go back a few more years man life really changed then and I think it just keeps keeps changing but one thing should always be never changing Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever you are my god you have washed me I am redeemed by your blood amen because if you keep that as because that does not change so it's whatever you go through in life doesn't matter what change in life it is going from a child to an adult or middle age or what do they call it now a pre quarter life crisis instead of a midlife crisis you know because people don't have a no notice because people have no no foundation what am i where know who I really am and people get scared oh well I can't be like this forever I got to change and do this but then they come down the road so I can't be like this forever I'm going to change and do this and they'll throw their family under the bus and go do this and do this and do this and and where are they but then if there's something in you saying no I'm a child of the king his Spirit will make this come into subjection amen he is in control we don't just want to float with the tide flow it with the stream the streamwise goes downhill we meant to go up hallelujah now God and simplicity I just let me read this he says when a man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed a grow a giant chasm and put himself and death on this side now we were born that way there's a cap member we read he broke down that middle wall of partition right he's left there's no way back so man is here God is here there's no way to bridge the gulf there's no way for him to get back but when he did God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or something for blood which Adam spoke or Abel spoke on the other side of the chasm on that side he's he's a son of God he's an offspring from God he's an adherent he's an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a creator himself even he's an offspring of God but when he crossed he separate he separated a sonship he's a sinner by nature so it goes from that so now a sinner by nature he's under the hand and Dominion of Satan and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce sin and only covered sin if you've got a red spot on my hand and covered it with white the red spot still there see it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach person it was the blood of his own son that we now confess sin drops into God's bleach try to find it again now I want to say this because you say well how did you feel when you did that don't go by feeling I'm in faith is not a feeling faith is the substance of things hoped for so it's actually a no so that you know you have it faith is not hope okay but so faith brother I mean you know the Lord Jesus never said do you feel that he says do you believe it do you believe it okay so when said you just be some the most answer you can be just be real sincere so he need to be right okay now so we're now confessed sin drops into God's bleach trying to find it again his blood try to find again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment okay now what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against them no more there's no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free hallelujah just as that Clorox or that ink can never be inked no more because it's broke up and sent back again and when sinners and when confession is confessed and being dropped into the bleach a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination we throw it into the lake of fire and the chasm is bridged and never to be coming to remembrance no more and a man stands justified as a son of God and he says simplicity so he says before sin man was a creator he had dominion but with cities on this other side of the chasm but when sinners confess into the blood of Jesus Christ that sin that you did that you should have yo taken the penalty for amen when Jesus took your penalty on Calvary the wrath that we should have received he took on Calvary amen but then now sin has to be destroyed does it not so now it goes back the one who initiated certain in the beginning which is Satan that's why the great white throne judgment is just a far bigger picture to what was in Genesis chapter 3 who did this the woman you gave me you know and then she says the serpent beguiled me that's why does this happen so so the so that so so God just takes us his finger and he gonna say now who caused this and then they give the evidence and then because Satan can hide anything it goes back onto the serpent right and who inspired the serpent to do it Satan himself so now the sin that was came into the world has just gone back onto the accuser and so the accuser becomes the accused right so the one who's trying to condemn everyone actually all the fingers get point back at him and he's actually the guilty one hallelujah so it's not us as guilty anymore it's him and he is going to take absence into the lake of fire hallelujah amen he says now when when sinners confessed into the you know into the blood of Jesus Christ amen it it takes sin away now you say this is so simple it is so to me it's amazing okay because you got it has to be in reality I trust this is in reality to you when sinners confessed and dropped into the blood of Jesus Christ it's like ink falling into Bleach right and then so the sinners broke it up and you can't find it anymore amen and it is not held against you anymore right and then so now all the symptoms so when a person is dipped into the blood how you dip this know if there's no VAT of blood you can be dipped into physically but it's by faith receiving what he's done for you because it's already been done is this clear yeah so it kills all symptoms and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire Alleluia so the accuser becomes the accused now here we are by one offering we forever perfected there he is perfected forever them that are sanctified by one offering it's not - you say you say this all the time but it's got a sink down we can't you know brother brave seasoned perfect faith if I believe it as something wrong they automatically put themselves back as a sinner again he says you must never do that right because we don't we don't start our journey you know this is not like monopoly where you go pass go all the time right you start your walk with God you leave Egypt he calls you out of the world hello you saying yeah I was back there and then he takes you through the Red Sea and your enemy is defeated behind you who has dominion over their enemies now amen the things that once your oppressor they did Amen and they just a trophy on your wall or however you want to put it and this and now you go through and then now you've been through the being through the wilderness who's been sanctified who's being sanctified amen and then you come to Jordan and then you die completely to yourself amen you cross Jordan by the word that's why it's that's why it's such a powerful thing the Levites now the Levites carried had their cross Jordan the Levites carried the ark and when they put their foot in the Jordan at separate the water and then the Ark stood there and Israel passed through and then once Israel passed over the Levites step down to the river and the river flowed again that chose now because the ark is the word so the ark being carried over the heart of the priest the Levite gives an opening for the people to go into the land aim it and so here we are here you are this message brings you into the promised land brings you into Christ really not just being in the wilderness and God anointing and doing things but now you step into your inheritance amen but now ah here we are now we've come to a I I just I just go to D because that's when the campaign went sideways quickly where Aitken took the yo the government and the wij of gold now Joshua and say hold on let's go back to young started getting he didn't go back but this is why you do in your mind I've got to go back to eat I've got a Oh Lord forgive me I'm a sinner he says well what do you mean now you believe because sin is unbelief is it not and be lord help my unbelief but you know remember brother brems says someone who's bored they just totally all under the blackness of sin that's why someone has not even made a step towards you know the Lord you can't tell them now you've got to stop dressing this way you're gonna stop smoking these things and drinking these things and watching these things and you've got to do this and this and this no because unbelief just governs the entire life doesn't do them any good they haven't even started right God doesn't condemn the sinner cuz he since he condemns him cuz he just doesn't he totally unbelief right and then so now but now we when we do things wrong that's why I says you should know stop doing these things to change what you're doing amen is that okay so Joshua didn't say now let's go back to Egypt he said let's keep they see what's going wrong let's let's fix this and keep taking on with the conquest and that's what they did it's the same thing with you and I it's not him the Falls with him that gets back up amen you're the steps of a good man ordered of the Lord and he delights in his way though he fall though fall he shall not be cast down the Lord upholds him in his hand does not heaven that falls and stays at him that gets back up that is the overcomer I mean the devil may may knock you out in the first round but you just just get back up Here I am Alleluia eventually hey it's either eventually you will would Amen eventually you will whoop but you have to have confidence and the one who's bought you because he is the one that not only trained you but he gives you the strength to overcome because it says in Revelation chapter 12 they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony they overcame Satan by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony so okay do we want to read that let's go to you know I see I see we're turning pages let's go to revelations chapter 12 and verse 11 now remember I love Revelation chapter 12 because it shows the devil lost in heaven and the same God that kicked him out of heaven has now come into human flesh and is kicking him out of here amen that's what God got at victory in heaven now he puts on human flesh near his victory here hallelujah and you happen to be the bodies he's in Laurie amen so now how did they overcome this great you know we think of this great devil and all isn't he terrible yeah he's a slicker but he's defeated he's a bluff that's how he it's through deception it's always been through deception that he is he has got a hold of people right but when he's exposed that's why Satan hides and secrets that's why you should never have secrets between you and your spouse you should never have any separation yeah tell me well we live in the same house but there shouldn't be any spiritual separation right and then so now he says and they overcame him Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death so they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb yes and the word of it now what is your testimony your testimony is now you give evidence that his word is true I mean what is a testimony when you go into court you're giving evidence this happened here this happen here this is what happened here so now your testimony is God's Word is right God's Word is truth amen we're testifying that God's Word is overcoming power we are testifying his blood is more than enough amen that's how they overcame him now this scripture is being looked out today 2017 amen because as the devil is your brother man says as the devil has been cast down the bride of sins amen and we are ascending we are ascending you go you look at back where where you were five ten years ago and the things that you had battles with and couldn't overcome and hated yourself for now they're just victories remember that campaign year we won it decisive victory move on we're asking we wipe out this enemy hallelujah so they overcame him by the blood lemon so it doesn't it does not say they overcame him by their own ability I just want to be real you say this is laborious no it's not because subconsciously if we can get this and we can just kick this out that is God's enablement that we are victorious and is by it not by power by might but by my spirit saith the Lord who has a spirit of God in them a man that means just by his Spirit he will do this just like when they're rebuilding Jerusalem Zechariah prophesied not by power not by might not by political will not by how you'll humanely rebuild the city by my spirit I'll anoint you to rebuild it amen yes sir so now I say so he's not saying by your ability by their ability they overcame all because they felt victorious for a week they overcame or because they were so happy they overcame amen by the blow the limb you're not even really in that verse you're on your own human ability right it says it says sacrifice and you can facing that it works and it's for you and it's true I meant that's how they overcome now we have some musicians to come we did I think I'll just land the plane I'll just keep going on but you see it's by him right there is power power wonder-working power in the blood of lamb but do you have confidence do you have confidence in it amen this is a walk of faith say well I don't know how this is going to turn out yeah we yeah you do what do you you know you have to look at I'm going in a rapture my family's going in a rapture no weapon formed against me shall prosper well let's let's let's read that shall we now remember this is under the Old Testament but to me it's just magnified in the new now if I can even is it in Isaiah 53 here we are Bible Quiz by me the scripture no weapon formed against me shall prosper so this is the excellent 5041 because the devil will form weapons just like an you just take a world war that goes on a bit longer the each side is trying to develop a new weapon to take out the enemy so no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgement shall condemn so now oh that is now right so every time so everything that rise up against you do you think you're really a believer do you think you're really the Bride of Christ you really think you're overcoming you really think you're gonna do it you have to condemn that time I meant because the member he's the accuser of the Brethren amen you read that in Revelations 12 as well so he will accuse you he does doesn't know what stand you amen you know he he it's like Zechariah I mean um you're the high priest there I think it's the book of Zechariah he was in his filthy garments and the devil stand there too to withstand him from coming into his position yeah I think God comes he's a Lord rebuke thee it's just take off his filthy garments put on the priests garments everything on him what's happening the enemy is here to withstand someone coming to their position hello that's you right wait can you just put that back up so no weapon fifty-four 117 yes thank you see this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is off sayeth I meant their righteousness of me not of themselves not if they good your conduct it is of me now just go read Romans chapter 8 and just have a Jubilee later God is for us who can be against us they said as a man of God is not yo impute sin to me I mean what can see a breast from the love of God in Christ nothing amen so that's true then it is true no weapon formed against you what happens okay here's a weapon he tries to get you back into your carnal nature amen he tries to begin you think no you can never be free of this thing that's a weapon that's formed against you but you've got to recognize oh they'll never change hello they'll never change he or she will always be like that we just go around this man will never stop going around this mountain that's a weapon that will not prosper it may be formed but do not worry about it it must come to a tee I'm a list and shall we I wanna they sing this power wonder-working power in the blood there is wonder-working power in the blood amen he said well I'm I'm wrestling with something just say just even
