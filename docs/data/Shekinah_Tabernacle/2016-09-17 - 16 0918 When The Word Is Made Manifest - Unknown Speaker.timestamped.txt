[48:07] wonderful
[48:08] hallelujah amen let's just go to um I
[48:12] want to go to uh let's go to Ruth
[48:14] chapter 3 again I want to pick up kind
[48:17] of uh I want to color in the picture a
[48:20] little bit more amen um because we live
[48:24] in an age
[48:25] where God has allowed uh we live in a
[48:29] season where God has has allowed his
[48:31] people to walk in a way that uh they
[48:34] have never been able to walk in ages
[48:36] past and I want to I want to speak about
[48:40] a uh maybe if I just start a subject you
[48:44] know I want to really speak about a
[48:45] subject when the wood becomes
[48:48] manifest you know there's uh you know
[48:50] there the Bible is full of Prophecy and
[48:52] it's been laying there some of them for
[48:54] thousands of years but yet there comes a
[48:57] season when that word becomes manifest
[48:59] amen and we understand that God you know
[49:02] his word you know Paul says that the
[49:04] sorry to have you standing but Paul says
[49:06] that uh you know the works were finished
[49:08] from the foundation of the world
[49:09] speaking the book of Hebrews so his word
[49:11] and it being manifest in The Eternity
[49:14] it's already done but then it comes from
[49:16] The Eternity down into time and it
[49:18] becomes manifested amen so what's
[49:20] already in in Heaven Must come upon the
[49:23] Earth and be manifested thank you Lord
[49:25] and so let's just read here in in in
[49:27] Ruth uh chapter 3 and we'll read verses
[49:29] 5 to9 then we'll go down to verse
[49:33] 18 and it says
[49:35] now um so so um so um so the earlier
[49:39] part of the chapter Naomi Ruth's mother
[49:42] uh Ruth's mother-in-law instructs her
[49:44] what to do and then Ruth replies and she
[49:46] said unto her all that thou sayest unto
[49:48] me I'll do and she went down unto the
[49:50] floor and did according to all that her
[49:52] mother-in-law B her and when Boaz had
[49:55] eaten and drunk and his heart was mared
[49:57] she went to lie down at the end uh he
[49:59] went to lie down at the end of the Heap
[50:01] of corn and she came softly and
[50:02] uncovered his feet and laid her down and
[50:06] it came to pass at midnight that the man
[50:08] was afraid and turned himself Behold a
[50:10] woman lay at his feet and he said who
[50:13] art thou and she said pdon me I am Ruth
[50:16] thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt
[50:19] pardon me over thy handmaid for thou art
[50:21] a near
[50:22] Kinsman let's just drop down to verse
[50:25] 18 um
[50:28] oh let's just read from verse 16 and
[50:30] when she came to her her her
[50:32] mother-in-law she said who art thou my
[50:34] daughter and she and she told her all
[50:37] that the man had had done to her so what
[50:40] Boaz had promised to do and she said
[50:42] these six measures of B gave he me for
[50:45] he said to me go not empty unto thy
[50:48] mother-in-law then said she sit still my
[50:50] daughter until thou know how the matter
[50:53] will fall for the man will not be in
[50:56] rest
[50:58] until uh until he have finished the
[51:01] thing this day amen so may the Lord
[51:03] bless his word you may you may be seated
[51:07] so just to uh just to a a quick summary
[51:12] of of a couple of Sundays ago we
[51:14] speaking about Ruth and how how Ruth was
[51:17] instructed find where he lays down this
[51:20] is the earlier part the chapter 5 where
[51:21] he lays down mark it lie his feet and
[51:25] then and then he will he will then
[51:28] instruct you what he's going to do and
[51:31] so Boaz is a type of Jesus Christ Ruth
[51:33] is a type of you and we were instructed
[51:36] to find where he laid down and Jesus
[51:38] laid down at Calvary and then so when
[51:42] when when we lay down at the feet of
[51:44] Jesus where he died then he begins to
[51:47] act on our behalf okay so because we
[51:49] understand reading the book of Ruth Boaz
[51:52] you know the first first say three
[51:54] chapters of Ruth it's Ruth doing
[51:56] everything everything but then there
[51:57] comes this chapter Where She lays at his
[52:00] feet and says cover me with your skirt
[52:03] because I'm a you know I'm a you because
[52:06] you are a Kinsman to me and so Ruth is
[52:09] actually saying because Ruth is not an
[52:10] Israelite she's a moabitas so Ruth is
[52:13] actually asking boas to cover her shame
[52:16] her old life everything she was to cover
[52:19] it with his
[52:20] righteousness and then um and because
[52:23] you are a Kinsman to me and there's the
[52:25] lord of the Kinsman red redemer were a a
[52:27] family member if they had the ability if
[52:30] they had the money or if they had the
[52:31] desire to do it they could redeem
[52:33] someone that was ens slavery yeah so so
[52:36] everyone everyone remember a couple of
[52:38] Sundays ago so then once once Ruth did
[52:41] this and Boaz knew that she was a
[52:44] Kinsman under her then Boaz began to act
[52:47] on Ruth's behalf and then the next
[52:50] chapter of Ruth it's all Boaz now he
[52:52] goes and redeems Naomi to to to marry
[52:55] Ruth then he marri Ruth and Ruth is no
[52:57] longer an alien in Israel but she's
[52:59] married to Boaz and all of her past life
[53:02] has done away with because she takes on
[53:04] his name thank you Lord and it's the
[53:05] same thing with us we take on the name
[53:07] of Jesus Christ and our old life is
[53:10] obliterated amen our our our everything
[53:12] we used to do that's not us
[53:15] anymore but now there's a part of the
[53:18] there's a part of the story and um so I
[53:20] just wanted to use it as a background
[53:22] because we're looking for a season where
[53:24] Paul would would would speak of in
[53:27] Romans chapter 8 and I just want
[53:29] to um I want to read this because Paul
[53:34] Paul when he was writing to the
[53:35] Believers he would he would speak about
[53:38] Redemption and and he would say that the
[53:40] blood of Jesus Christ has has redeemed
[53:42] you but he would speak about he would
[53:45] speak in Romans chapter 8 and he would
[53:48] he would speak about the adoption the
[53:50] fullness of adoption and we let's just
[53:53] read from from verse chapter 18 and
[53:55] Romans chapter we're going to have a bit
[53:57] of reading today but I want to I want
[53:59] you to recognize as Paul and I know I've
[54:01] said this a few times but Paul in the
[54:04] book of Hebrews he always contrasted
[54:06] what they had to what they had I mean
[54:09] what they have to what they had so what
[54:11] they had under the blood of bulls and
[54:13] goats he contrasted it to what they have
[54:16] now under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[54:18] he was making that great contrast
[54:20] because the Hebrews remember the Jews
[54:22] were slowly going out and the Gentiles
[54:24] were coming in so blind was coming on
[54:27] the on the Hebrews and the eyes of the
[54:29] Gentiles were coming open all right so
[54:32] he was contrasting these things cuz he
[54:34] was trying to get them to see that what
[54:36] they had was greater you know don't just
[54:39] be because he said let us go let us go
[54:42] on let let us just not start the walk
[54:44] let us go unto him am mean so don't just
[54:47] start walking with the Lord don't just
[54:49] get baptized repent and get baptized go
[54:52] all the way into the baptism of the Holy
[54:54] Ghost amen because Paul said to Apollos
[54:58] in Acts 19 we're going to read this but
[55:00] I just want to say this he said to
[55:01] Apollos in Acts 19 have you received the
[55:03] Holy Ghost since you have believed I
[55:06] mean so Apollos was believing he was
[55:08] preaching from the scripture that Jesus
[55:10] was the Christ so he was a Believer but
[55:13] he had not received the Holy Ghost since
[55:15] he had believed and that's many times
[55:18] there comes a failure is that people do
[55:20] not go on and to receive the Holy Ghost
[55:23] God can do a work and he starts a work
[55:25] and he trans you know he you know he
[55:27] delivers from things and he you know
[55:29] does a glorious Deliverance but then you
[55:32] have to be sealed in amen amen so and
[55:36] and so that's why Paul was trying to
[55:38] tell the Hebrews what you have is
[55:39] greater what you have is greater than
[55:41] the blood of bulls and goats you know
[55:43] let us go onto the fullness of it amen
[55:46] and so now Paul would say to the Romans
[55:49] in in in in chapter 8 here in verse
[55:52] verse 18 down he says for I reckon that
[55:54] the suffering of this present time and
[55:57] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[55:59] that shall be revealed in us for the
[56:01] earnest expectation of the creature and
[56:03] we know that that word creature is the
[56:05] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[56:08] of the sons of God for the creature was
[56:12] not made was made subject to vanity not
[56:15] willingly but by reason of him that had
[56:18] subjected The sameon Hope because the
[56:21] creature itself also shall be delivered
[56:23] from the corruption of bondage and to
[56:25] the glory
[56:26] Liberty of the children of God for we
[56:29] know that the whole creation granth and
[56:32] travaileth in pain together until now
[56:35] and not only they but ourselves also
[56:37] which have the first fruits of the
[56:39] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[56:42] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[56:46] the Redemption of our body so Paul Paul
[56:50] would begin to speak here and we
[56:53] understand adoption now I just trust
[56:55] that you follow me today but we
[56:58] understand that adoption in in in Bible
[57:01] language is not like it is today because
[57:04] today adoption is you go get a child
[57:08] that's not part of your family and then
[57:11] you sign a piece of paper saying now
[57:13] this is legally my son or daughter and
[57:15] then now they're part of your family
[57:17] that is that is modern day adoption but
[57:19] Bible adoption is a is is a child that's
[57:22] been born into the family it's the
[57:24] placing of that child in the family amen
[57:28] so it says you know you know Paul would
[57:30] say that the we're under chutters you
[57:32] know you you know the son is under chuds
[57:34] and he's instructed but then there comes
[57:36] a day when the when the father asks the
[57:38] chudah well how's my son doing and the
[57:41] chuda says he's exactly like you and
[57:44] then so the father now says okay he's
[57:46] ready and then there's a there's a
[57:48] there's a ceremony where now the son is
[57:51] now placed in his position as a son and
[57:54] his authority and word is the same as
[57:56] the father
[57:57] speaking amen so so that is that is real
[58:00] adoption it's the placing that it's the
[58:03] placing of the son in their position in
[58:05] the body of the family same with the
[58:08] daughter amen so but he's saying that
[58:12] the fullness of that adoption is the
[58:14] change is the Redemption of the body and
[58:16] that Redemption of the body is the body
[58:19] change okay so the fullness of our
[58:22] adoption because now now with God
[58:25] working all around the world is when
[58:27] you're birthed into the kingdom now then
[58:30] the Holy Spirit places you in the body
[58:32] of Christ amen so whatever the because
[58:36] all of us have a gift all of us have
[58:39] some kind of ministry if it's a
[58:41] five-fold Ministry if a helper a
[58:42] government or a musician or you know
[58:44] whatever it is it's we have that gift
[58:47] within us and then now the Holy Ghost
[58:49] takes you and places you in the body to
[58:52] function fully in that position so that
[58:55] itself isn't adoption amen but the
[58:58] fullness of that adoption is when these
[59:00] atoms are changed and we go into the
[59:02] next world that's the fullness of it so
[59:05] now we are
[59:08] looking we are looking for that season
[59:11] but now as I said I said in the very
[59:13] beginning there just my opening comments
[59:15] is that now there has to come a time
[59:18] when that becomes
[59:19] manifested amen because the word is all
[59:22] complete it's all finished but it has to
[59:25] be manifested down into time and so God
[59:28] is God he a lots prophecies out for
[59:31] certain ages remember Noah could not
[59:33] have had a Rapture it wasn't time yeah
[59:36] Moses couldn't have had a Rapture it
[59:38] wasn't
[59:39] time the first church they believed they
[59:42] were going to go on a Rapture but there
[59:43] were seven Church ages amen and we're
[59:46] living at the end of the seventh Church
[59:48] age so now we're living in a season
[59:50] where that scripture of the of the
[59:53] adoption to the Redemption of our body
[59:55] that is going to be become manifested
[59:57] amen amen now I want you to understand
[1:00:00] from the get-go this is all God's doing
[1:00:03] amen you cannot change you canot create
[1:00:07] a Rapture in your own strength that's
[1:00:08] right amen and then many times you know
[1:00:12] we think of we think of the bride of
[1:00:14] Christ and we think of you know what we
[1:00:17] think it is to really be the bride of
[1:00:19] Christ and we put that image on some
[1:00:22] pedestal but the reality of it is very
[1:00:24] different that's right you John the
[1:00:26] Baptist it says you know Isaiah
[1:00:28] prophesied you know when he comes with
[1:00:30] his message every high place will be
[1:00:32] made low and every low Place made High
[1:00:35] and the you leaves will clap their H
[1:00:37] hands and the mountains will skip like
[1:00:38] Rams and all these things were going on
[1:00:41] but here was a man who came out of the
[1:00:42] Wilderness wrapped up in a camel skin
[1:00:45] standing kneed deep in mud in the Jordan
[1:00:47] repeating you know preaching the kingdom
[1:00:50] of God is at hand you've got to repent
[1:00:52] right and that was the manifestation of
[1:00:54] that prophecy amen amen so when you know
[1:00:57] no doubt when they read that they think
[1:00:59] W what a glorious all the high places
[1:01:00] made Low Low Places made high it's going
[1:01:02] to be incredible and when it was
[1:01:04] fulfilled he was one man out of the
[1:01:06] Wilderness a w you know you know a man
[1:01:09] who you know preached about you know the
[1:01:10] AES laid to the root of the tree New
[1:01:12] Generation of Vipers and that was the
[1:01:14] manifestation of that scripture and then
[1:01:17] he says about the you know you know
[1:01:19] about the Messiah coming he says he'll
[1:01:21] take a fan in his hand he thoroughly
[1:01:22] Purge his floor and do all these things
[1:01:25] and here came a second cousin after the
[1:01:27] flesh amen and here was now the Lamb of
[1:01:30] God to take away the sin of the
[1:01:32] world and you see how his ministry was
[1:01:36] you know so man has no idea it's going
[1:01:38] to be a glorious thing and it is a
[1:01:40] glorious thing amen amen but often but
[1:01:43] but the but the manifestation of it is
[1:01:45] very different to many times what we
[1:01:48] think it
[1:01:48] is amen so now we're in the season now
[1:01:54] where there's a there's there is the
[1:01:56] Redemption of our
[1:01:58] body now I want to go let's just if
[1:02:01] you're still in Romans chapter 8 I want
[1:02:03] to go further further up now now there
[1:02:06] has to be there has to be a
[1:02:09] recognition that there's a people that
[1:02:11] know that they're Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:13] God all right and so if we read up here
[1:02:17] from verse verse
[1:02:19] 14 it says for as many are as led by the
[1:02:22] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:02:25] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:02:26] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:02:29] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:02:32] you cry Abba Father the spirit itself
[1:02:35] beareth witness with our spirit we are
[1:02:37] the children of God and if children then
[1:02:39] ears ears of God joint ears with Christ
[1:02:42] if so be that we suffer with him pardon
[1:02:45] me we may also be glorified together so
[1:02:48] he says now you have not received the
[1:02:50] spirit have not received the spirit of
[1:02:52] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:02:55] received the spirit of adoption or the
[1:02:56] placing of a son whereby you cry Abba
[1:03:00] Father and that word Abba it speaks of a
[1:03:03] father as a as a as a vocation and the
[1:03:08] vocation is now identify as a person
[1:03:10] that's being addressed so when the
[1:03:13] spirit of God comes upon the seat of God
[1:03:15] there's a cry out of their heart saying
[1:03:17] Abba Father or my father my father
[1:03:20] there's a distinct recognition or
[1:03:22] Revelation that God is your father amen
[1:03:25] so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] causes a person to recognize who their
[1:03:31] father is where they come from and where
[1:03:32] they're going amen and and and I was
[1:03:35] thinking about this now our identity you
[1:03:38] I mean how we conduct ourselves is
[1:03:41] really the vast majority of it is based
[1:03:44] on our identity amen we know we have
[1:03:47] different personalities but for example
[1:03:49] if I was born in Australia my identity
[1:03:53] would be different to me being born here
[1:03:55] and how conduct myself would be
[1:03:57] different because I'd be molded and
[1:03:59] shaped by the culture over there amen
[1:04:02] even you know and or or if my parents
[1:04:06] chose to live in South Africa I would be
[1:04:08] different to what I am now because the
[1:04:11] culture and the situation around me
[1:04:13] molds me and shapes me a certain way and
[1:04:17] and that is because I'm identifying
[1:04:19] myself with that country amen why are
[1:04:23] new zealanders proud to be new
[1:04:25] zealanders because they're they're
[1:04:26] associating this is my country this is
[1:04:29] where I'm from this is the nation of my
[1:04:30] birth amen and they identify themselves
[1:04:34] with whatever the New Zealand culture is
[1:04:37] and you take that to every country under
[1:04:39] heaven but then there Comes A Time now
[1:04:41] when you recognize I trust you recognize
[1:04:44] that you're a son or daughter of God
[1:04:47] where the spirit of God has come upon
[1:04:48] you where you cry Abba Father or my
[1:04:50] father my father and then now that
[1:04:53] Revelation causes your life to be
[1:04:55] conducted very differently amen because
[1:04:57] you know you're a son or daughter of the
[1:04:59] king wow amen it's just like the you
[1:05:02] know brother Bram would tell the story
[1:05:03] of that of that African you know who was
[1:05:06] a slave there taken over to America and
[1:05:09] the slave buyer goes to the plantation
[1:05:11] and he sees all the slaves and he
[1:05:12] notices a particular slave and he says I
[1:05:15] want to buy this one and the plantation
[1:05:17] owner says no he's not for sale and and
[1:05:20] then he but then he studies them a bit
[1:05:21] more and he says well why is he
[1:05:23] different do you feed him different no
[1:05:25] he he receives all the same food as the
[1:05:27] other slaves does he live a different
[1:05:28] place no he he he he he sleeps in the
[1:05:31] same you know same place they sleep that
[1:05:34] you know well and then he says well why
[1:05:36] is he different and then the plantation
[1:05:37] owner says well I wonder that myself and
[1:05:40] I found out that he's a son of a king of
[1:05:43] a tribe in Africa hallelujah amen and
[1:05:46] because he is a son of a king he
[1:05:48] conducts himself as a son of a king and
[1:05:51] even though he's an alien in this place
[1:05:53] and you know he'll never go back and
[1:05:55] take the C he still conducts himself
[1:05:57] that way hallelujah amen and if a if a
[1:06:00] man with just a natural recognition
[1:06:02] knowing who he was could conduct himself
[1:06:04] in such a way how much more a son and
[1:06:06] daughter of God who's been Blood Washed
[1:06:08] who's been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:06:10] Lamb amen because our identity is not to
[1:06:13] be with our culture amen amen our true
[1:06:16] identity is to be with the word am amen
[1:06:18] amen that's right amen so there comes a
[1:06:21] time when we begin to recognize who we
[1:06:24] are Hallelujah now in Galatians let's go
[1:06:26] to Galatians chapter 4 because we know
[1:06:29] very well and brother Braham brings us
[1:06:31] out we do not become Sons or daughters
[1:06:34] by the new birth we already were Sons or
[1:06:37] Daughters of God am mean you you know
[1:06:39] that's why you just got to rejoice it
[1:06:41] doesn't matter what condition you may
[1:06:43] find yourself in and the things you
[1:06:46] wrestle with you've just if you know I
[1:06:49] come from God I go back to God Amen if
[1:06:52] you know that you are a son and daughter
[1:06:53] of his don't Focus on the battles you
[1:06:56] may be facing or the problems you may
[1:06:58] have or the questions you may have focus
[1:07:00] on God Amen because many times we look
[1:07:03] at the things that we're battling with
[1:07:04] trying to work it out and we get
[1:07:06] sidetracked
[1:07:09] amen when David was going to be stoned
[1:07:12] by his own men after the amalekites
[1:07:15] whoever was took their families away
[1:07:16] burnt Zig the city took all their
[1:07:18] families away what did David
[1:07:21] do amen I know brother Andy was in spy
[1:07:25] you know wrote the song but David did
[1:07:28] not you know try and work out the
[1:07:30] situation he didn't let it Sidetrack him
[1:07:32] he delighted himself in the Lord amen
[1:07:36] amen oh that must have been a hard you
[1:07:39] know he kept the focus he knew the
[1:07:42] problem was there he didn't disregard it
[1:07:44] cuz he had to get back his own family
[1:07:46] but he delighted himself in the Lord and
[1:07:48] the Lord now came and instructed him
[1:07:50] what to do and rallied his men and
[1:07:52] everythingall so that is the most that
[1:07:54] is the most important thing cuz there's
[1:07:56] so many voices in this age there's so
[1:07:59] many distractions it can just be
[1:08:01] everyday life can be a distraction but
[1:08:03] don't get if you have and we all have
[1:08:05] things that we're facing we have
[1:08:06] problems with whatever more but the
[1:08:09] secret is don't get so wound up in your
[1:08:11] mind about the problem focus on God amen
[1:08:15] amen because man has been focusing on
[1:08:17] the problem since they left Eden and
[1:08:19] look where Man Has Come
[1:08:22] amen we can't continue in the same way
[1:08:25] that's
[1:08:27] if you if you lift it before the Lord
[1:08:29] delight yourself in him he will give you
[1:08:31] the answer and he will actually put his
[1:08:34] finger on the on the root cause of the
[1:08:36] thing thank you Lord amen just as
[1:08:38] brother John said in the song service
[1:08:40] you know it brings things from
[1:08:43] undercover amen now um sorry Galatians
[1:08:47] chapter
[1:08:48] 4 and and verse 4
[1:08:51] to7 but when the fullness of the time
[1:08:54] was come God sent forth a son made of a
[1:08:57] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:09:00] that were under the law that we might
[1:09:02] receive the adoption of sons and because
[1:09:06] ye are
[1:09:08] Sons I like that word are amen God sent
[1:09:12] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:09:14] hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou
[1:09:18] Art no more a servant but a son and of a
[1:09:21] son then an heir of God through Christ
[1:09:25] so we are not we are not
[1:09:28] servants amen there's a big difference
[1:09:30] between a servant and a son a servant a
[1:09:34] servant can lose his position in the
[1:09:36] household amen based on his own
[1:09:40] ability amen just like a job how do you
[1:09:44] how do you lose a job you don't do it as
[1:09:47] you should be and you get fired amen but
[1:09:51] the difference between a servant and a
[1:09:53] son is a son is always part of the
[1:09:55] family
[1:09:56] because you're a blood you're blood
[1:09:58] relative to the head of the family amen
[1:10:00] and by being born into that family you
[1:10:03] have been given a position in that
[1:10:05] family a servant cannot go to the place
[1:10:08] of a
[1:10:09] son amen are you following me I trust
[1:10:12] this makes you a bit happy this morning
[1:10:15] because you ought to understand that
[1:10:16] there's there's come a day where
[1:10:18] everything that the devil has held
[1:10:21] against you has been struck
[1:10:22] off amen and we're living I'm going to
[1:10:24] go to Revelations chap 5 because well I
[1:10:27] might just I might just mention it now
[1:10:29] just to know just so you know where I'm
[1:10:30] going John when he saw the book being
[1:10:33] taken remember he's lifted up into an
[1:10:36] eternal realm but I said everything in
[1:10:38] eternity must be manifested upon the
[1:10:40] Earth okay so John when he saw the book
[1:10:43] being taken and the lamb opening the
[1:10:45] seals it says that John everything in
[1:10:49] heaven in the earth and under the Earth
[1:10:51] heard John cry out worthy and honor and
[1:10:53] blessings and glory be to the L
[1:10:55] amen cuz he's redeemed us so John so
[1:10:59] John was rejoicing before that he was
[1:11:01] weeping but then he's rejoicing but now
[1:11:04] he's lifted up into Eternal realm and
[1:11:07] John represents the bride of Christ amen
[1:11:11] one man in the vision brother Braham
[1:11:12] says can represent a whole body of
[1:11:14] people than Lord amen just like John
[1:11:17] being taken up at the end of the church
[1:11:18] ages up in the Rapture he is symbolizing
[1:11:20] you he's a symbol in the book himself
[1:11:22] and so now when John sees the lamb take
[1:11:25] the book and begin to
[1:11:26] Rejoice that I'd say that
[1:11:29] Revival amen that Revelation can't just
[1:11:33] stay up in the eternities it's got to
[1:11:35] fall Upon A people am mean that word
[1:11:38] must become manifested Lord just like
[1:11:41] the great and the harlot's being
[1:11:42] burnt and the will becoming new and
[1:11:44] everything else that you read about in
[1:11:46] The Book of Revelation so must the
[1:11:49] Revelation that the lamb has taken the
[1:11:51] book amen he took it on your behalf
[1:11:54] remember it's all symbol
[1:11:55] and he wiped away all the claims against
[1:11:58] it that Revelation must drop down onto a
[1:12:01] people that's where I'm going cuz that's
[1:12:03] the fullness of redemption thank you
[1:12:05] Lord it's tied up with what the lamb
[1:12:07] does for youl not what you do but what
[1:12:09] the lamb does for you and then what you
[1:12:12] do for the lamb is just actually you
[1:12:14] your love projecting back to him for
[1:12:16] what he's done for you that's right amen
[1:12:19] amen that's why we live the Christian
[1:12:20] Life out of Thanksgiving just like
[1:12:23] Wednesday when God was moving I just sat
[1:12:25] there I just so thankful cuz God doesn't
[1:12:27] have to move he's not obligated that's
[1:12:29] right God is Sovereign amen amen God is
[1:12:33] Sovereign this is just how I feel I
[1:12:34] might be off too far on one side but I
[1:12:37] feel God does not have to bless us like
[1:12:40] he does oh but where're his children
[1:12:42] he's still Sovereign amen it's his
[1:12:45] choosing I'm going and he saw the
[1:12:47] remember he saw the meeting before the
[1:12:49] foundation of the world sure but he
[1:12:51] actually made a choice they my children
[1:12:53] are there I'm going to go visit them
[1:12:54] that way amen because I choose to not
[1:12:57] because not just because they're calling
[1:12:58] for it but because I want to do it amen
[1:13:01] so it's all what God is and that's why I
[1:13:03] just so thankful because God is gracious
[1:13:07] amen God is good to us thank you Lord
[1:13:10] Wonder amen so so that's where I'm going
[1:13:13] but now so a son now as he said now we
[1:13:16] because you are Sons he sent forth the
[1:13:20] spirit of he s sent forth the spirit of
[1:13:22] his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:13:24] Father father so there has to come a
[1:13:27] recognition now now remember as I said
[1:13:29] about the using the story of the slave I
[1:13:32] mean the African who was a son of a king
[1:13:34] but now a slave in America he was now he
[1:13:37] his life was conducted as a King's son
[1:13:41] amen so now when the true spirit of God
[1:13:44] comes into the soul of the Bride they
[1:13:47] will conduct themselves according to the
[1:13:50] king hallelujah
[1:13:52] amen amen and they will know who their
[1:13:55] father is that's right amen because if
[1:13:58] you know who your parents are and you
[1:14:00] love them you want to live a life that
[1:14:02] is pleasing to them to give them honor
[1:14:05] and he deserves all honor glory and
[1:14:07] praise amen and you and you see now it's
[1:14:10] like the it's like the story of the
[1:14:12] prodical son it's in Luke chapter 15 now
[1:14:15] we understand that the reason the reason
[1:14:20] the son could go back to the father's
[1:14:22] house and be restored back to his
[1:14:25] position as a son is because he was a
[1:14:27] son amen I know it may be very simple
[1:14:30] but I just trust that it it it it it it
[1:14:32] means a bit more to you the reason that
[1:14:34] he could go back remember he says I want
[1:14:36] my inheritance so the father gave him
[1:14:38] the inheritance but then he had didn't
[1:14:40] have the wisdom how to use it and he
[1:14:42] found himself in poverty in a Strange
[1:14:45] Land feeding feeding the pigs of a you
[1:14:49] know of of some farmer over there and he
[1:14:52] was so hungry that he just wished he
[1:14:54] could eat the pig
[1:14:56] food amen this is the condition he found
[1:14:59] himself in but then he came to himself
[1:15:01] he says if I could only just go back to
[1:15:03] Father's house but then I know it's I
[1:15:06] know it's the heart of every repentant
[1:15:08] son or daughter of God he says I'm not
[1:15:10] worthy to be a son I'll just be happy if
[1:15:12] he makes me a servant but now but now
[1:15:15] the heart of that is one we should we
[1:15:17] have to come to God with humility like
[1:15:19] that but number two it's what's
[1:15:22] happening now is he doesn't when he's
[1:15:23] saying those things he do not understand
[1:15:26] the grace of his father because he's
[1:15:28] thinking now I will become a servant so
[1:15:31] I can earn my way back into the family
[1:15:34] amen he's thinking I need to earn I need
[1:15:37] to earn the respect and Trust of My
[1:15:40] Father Again beautiful and I know
[1:15:42] naturally you know you have to you can't
[1:15:44] just demand trust and respect you have
[1:15:46] to earn those things but this was his
[1:15:48] heart so number one he had to come that
[1:15:50] way he couldn't just storm back home and
[1:15:52] say Here I Am dad cuz he never would
[1:15:54] have been placed back in his position
[1:15:56] cuz he would never have learned his
[1:15:57] lesson amen so he came in real Godly
[1:16:00] humility and reverence knowing he had
[1:16:02] done wrong but then the flip side of
[1:16:05] that was you know because if his father
[1:16:07] just said okay now you be a servant he
[1:16:09] would have been very happy with that
[1:16:11] because but then he'd have to feel now I
[1:16:13] have to earn my way back and to be a son
[1:16:15] again amen amen but the re but but you
[1:16:18] see the father he was not looking at his
[1:16:21] son that way he just wanted his son back
[1:16:24] amen amen so even before his son got to
[1:16:27] his father's house the father cuz they
[1:16:29] were praying and his prayers caused the
[1:16:31] drought and the hardship hallelujah amen
[1:16:35] because he was a he was a Believer and
[1:16:37] and so the father was looking for the
[1:16:38] son to come back amen and so when he was
[1:16:41] coming back the father ran to him put
[1:16:44] put a good robe on him and put his ring
[1:16:46] on his finger remember the ring just
[1:16:49] like the king his signant was on his
[1:16:50] ring his seal was on his ring and
[1:16:53] whenever laws are written they had to
[1:16:55] seal it with the Seal of the king to
[1:16:57] show that the authority of the King was
[1:16:59] behind those words and so that's why the
[1:17:02] that's why the son that's why the father
[1:17:03] gave his son the ring he's actually
[1:17:06] saying now because remember he was a he
[1:17:08] was a bigger he was in rags when he came
[1:17:11] she's like I I'm going to put my robe
[1:17:13] over you so so what you have just done
[1:17:15] is not even seen anymore as as our lord
[1:17:18] Jesus doesn't just cover our sin but
[1:17:20] wipes it away and not only that now I'm
[1:17:23] going to put a ring on your finger to
[1:17:25] show now you're my son you're back in
[1:17:26] your position amen but the reason that
[1:17:30] the father did that is because he was a
[1:17:32] son he didn't become a son he already
[1:17:34] was a son amen and it's the same thing
[1:17:36] with you and I amen this world may Cloud
[1:17:39] us over and we may think all different
[1:17:41] kinds of things but there comes a season
[1:17:43] when the word comes your way Hallelujah
[1:17:46] and you just think now I need to return
[1:17:48] to Father's House amen back to a real
[1:17:51] relationship with Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ and then when you come he's
[1:17:57] waiting
[1:17:59] hallelujah thank now if we go to First
[1:18:04] Peter I want to
[1:18:08] read read a
[1:18:12] scripture time good so 1 Peter chapter 1
[1:18:17] and 8-12
[1:18:29] I'm in second
[1:18:31] Peter
[1:18:33] okay whom having not seen ye love and
[1:18:37] whom though now you see him not yet
[1:18:39] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:18:41] unspeakable and full of Glory receiving
[1:18:44] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:18:45] of your souls of which salvation the
[1:18:49] prophets have inquired and searched
[1:18:50] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[1:18:53] that should come unto you
[1:18:55] searching what or what manner of time
[1:18:57] the spirit of Christ was in them did
[1:19:00] signify when it testified beforeand the
[1:19:03] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[1:19:05] should follow unto whom it was revealed
[1:19:08] that not unto themselves but unto us
[1:19:11] they did Minister the things which are
[1:19:13] now reported unto you by them that have
[1:19:16] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:19:17] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[1:19:20] things the Angels desired to look into
[1:19:25] so now Peter's Peter's Peter's
[1:19:28] saying the prophets were looking for
[1:19:31] this
[1:19:32] time and by the Holy Ghost they weren't
[1:19:36] Minister when they spoke of it they
[1:19:37] weren't speaking to themselves but to
[1:19:39] you they ministering them to you yeah so
[1:19:42] the so the Believers down Through the
[1:19:43] Ages have been looking for the
[1:19:46] restoration of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:19:48] God and annihilation of sin amen that's
[1:19:51] what they've been looking for because
[1:19:54] they know
[1:19:55] they know that God because since God's
[1:19:57] in nature and you know the seasons that
[1:19:59] goes you know you know we're back in
[1:20:01] Spring a year a year before this we're
[1:20:03] in Spring and so the so so there so it's
[1:20:06] like an eternity amen but so it doesn't
[1:20:09] stay the same season the seasons change
[1:20:13] yeah and so now the Believers knew that
[1:20:15] how life was under the blood of bulls
[1:20:18] and goats or what you know whatever
[1:20:20] condition they're in they knew this is
[1:20:21] not the end of it The Season's got to
[1:20:24] change
[1:20:25] Eden's got to come back again sin's got
[1:20:27] to be done away with these bodies have
[1:20:30] got to be changed you know they knew
[1:20:32] they knew that there there was more to
[1:20:34] it wasn't just this now for
[1:20:36] eternity amen and so they were looking
[1:20:40] into these things then God would reveal
[1:20:42] to them what he's going to do but there
[1:20:44] comes a season where the prophecy
[1:20:46] becomes fulfilled or the word becomes
[1:20:49] manifested amen and so now red
[1:20:56] Redemption
[1:20:58] Redemption I just want to speak about
[1:21:00] Redemption for a little bit now
[1:21:02] Redemption must happen through a person
[1:21:04] maybe I'll go back a bit Redemption
[1:21:06] means to redeem back something back to
[1:21:08] its original position yes that's what
[1:21:12] Redemption is Redemption is not just say
[1:21:15] just say my phone here which I'm going
[1:21:17] to read some things out it if I went and
[1:21:20] bought this phone and I never had it in
[1:21:22] the first place that's not redeeming my
[1:21:24] phone yes redeeming my phone is it's
[1:21:27] mine but it gets lost and even if I have
[1:21:30] to pay a price for it I will and then I
[1:21:32] take it back to myself that now the
[1:21:35] phone has been restored back to its
[1:21:36] original position and so the Redemption
[1:21:39] of
[1:21:40] man happens exactly the same way now I
[1:21:45] now I know you've heard these things for
[1:21:46] a long time but I want you to understand
[1:21:49] God is in a process of
[1:21:51] redemption yes so he wants to rest Resto
[1:21:54] us back before there was a fall yes amen
[1:21:59] and the first part of that is he
[1:22:00] restores your soul back before there was
[1:22:03] a fall but now your body has to catch up
[1:22:06] with that
[1:22:07] Redemption
[1:22:09] amen and but but Redemption so we were
[1:22:14] Fallen but to be redeemed is not just to
[1:22:16] be patched up but the fullness of
[1:22:19] redemption is finished when these bodies
[1:22:20] are changed amen amen when Jesus died on
[1:22:24] Calvary it wasn't just it wasn't just to
[1:22:27] forgive us of our sins though that is
[1:22:29] the main part of it cuz he had to
[1:22:31] purchase our Redemption and he did but
[1:22:34] the fullness of the fullness of what he
[1:22:36] did at Calvary will be manifested when
[1:22:38] these bodies are changen but then
[1:22:41] there's also When sin is done away with
[1:22:43] and The Serpent and the dragon and the
[1:22:45] false prophet is thrown into the Lake of
[1:22:47] Fire and then the world is
[1:22:49] renewed amen and there's a new heavens
[1:22:52] and a new Earth that that all started
[1:22:57] amen we know it started with the flood
[1:22:59] because because the you know brother B
[1:23:01] tells in the future home but the
[1:23:02] purchasing of the Earth the claiming
[1:23:04] part of the Earth was now when Jesus
[1:23:06] died on Calvary he's laying he's laying
[1:23:09] claim amen so maybe I'll jump back a bit
[1:23:13] now the book in the right hand of him
[1:23:15] that sat upon the throne is called the
[1:23:18] title deed to the Earth yeah so it's so
[1:23:22] it's like buying a piece of property
[1:23:24] with when you buy it you have a title
[1:23:27] amen you have the title and so and
[1:23:30] because you have the paperwork just say
[1:23:32] if this is it you can prove legally by
[1:23:34] the paperwork this piece of property
[1:23:36] belongs to me and so now when when Adam
[1:23:40] and Eve were in the garden Adam had the
[1:23:43] paperwork had the deed to eternal life
[1:23:45] he had the deed to the Earth yeah amen
[1:23:51] now if I've repeated myself I feel that
[1:23:54] we you need to really this needs to sink
[1:23:56] in quite a lot because you got to
[1:23:58] understand there's nothing held against
[1:23:59] you anymore amen amen so now so
[1:24:03] now when When sin came into the world
[1:24:07] that book remember it's symbolic but
[1:24:09] that right to eternal life was lost by
[1:24:12] Adam but it couldn't go into the hands
[1:24:14] of the devil it went back into the hands
[1:24:17] of the original Creator which is God
[1:24:19] himself amen and there it is
[1:24:22] set and now there's a dis dispute over
[1:24:26] who does Adam's Fallen race belong to
[1:24:29] amen because if you can you know and the
[1:24:33] world itself but Satan's really all he
[1:24:36] really cares about is destroying the
[1:24:37] souls of men amen so there's been a
[1:24:41] dispute from that day to this day who
[1:24:44] does who does who does Humanity who do
[1:24:46] who do they belong to and Satan Satan
[1:24:50] because we are born in a fallen State he
[1:24:52] has a claim on us amen that's right he
[1:24:55] has a claim on you by your first birth
[1:24:59] and so he can and because now so
[1:25:02] Humanity now because of that Satan says
[1:25:05] no they belong to me but remember he's a
[1:25:08] squatter he's just a bluff amen but
[1:25:11] there has to come a time where where
[1:25:13] it's actually proven who does man belong
[1:25:16] to yeah and so now in the days of Noah
[1:25:21] the world was washed off just like you
[1:25:23] were repent to be baptized in the name
[1:25:25] of Jesus Christ but sin still came
[1:25:27] through the ark amen so even though the
[1:25:30] sin was what all the previous sin was
[1:25:32] washed off sin still came through amen
[1:25:36] just like you and I amen okay that's
[1:25:39] right and but then now Jesus came and he
[1:25:43] laid claim this is mine amen this was
[1:25:46] Emanuel God became flesh the word became
[1:25:49] flesh and dwelt Among Us and by Jesus
[1:25:52] dying on the cross now in his life he
[1:25:56] was laying claim this world is mine
[1:25:59] Adam's Fallen race is mine nature is
[1:26:02] mine this whole thing's mine he's laying
[1:26:04] claim amen and so and it's just like us
[1:26:09] now remember his blood Sanctified the
[1:26:11] Earth but there still there's still sin
[1:26:15] amen and so it's the same thing with you
[1:26:17] and I God sanctifies us of our old life
[1:26:22] of our old nature but then now the Holy
[1:26:25] Ghost has to come in and change the
[1:26:27] nature of the individual that they don't
[1:26:30] end up in the old life amen it's like
[1:26:33] it's like a person who has fallen into
[1:26:35] debt and they can't pay the debt and
[1:26:37] then a then a rich man comes and he says
[1:26:40] I'll pay your debt off amen now that man
[1:26:43] whose debts are now wiped he can be
[1:26:45] thankful but he can go into debt again
[1:26:48] what he needs is the spirit of the rich
[1:26:50] man to come into him that he has wisdom
[1:26:52] how to use his finances
[1:26:54] because if the spirit of the rich man
[1:26:56] comes into him then he won't get into
[1:26:57] dead again and it's the same thing with
[1:26:59] you and I you know the Lord has forgiven
[1:27:02] our debt okay but we need the spirit of
[1:27:06] God to come in and I trust he has am
[1:27:09] amen and if he has you will not come
[1:27:13] into dead
[1:27:14] again amen because it's not you now it's
[1:27:18] him are you following me amen so now so
[1:27:23] now Jesus sheds his blood upon the Earth
[1:27:26] and now there's a there's a dispute
[1:27:28] going on and you can see it in Jesus's
[1:27:32] Ministry you can even go back to Mo you
[1:27:34] know all the way when when the when when
[1:27:36] the truth comes like for example you
[1:27:39] take Moses and Pharaoh there was a
[1:27:42] dispute who does Israel belong to amen
[1:27:46] Satan was in Pharaoh saying they're my
[1:27:47] slaves are do with them what they want
[1:27:49] what I want to do they're just they're
[1:27:51] just a tool they're not even human
[1:27:53] beings they're just slaves
[1:27:54] then God comes down and Moses saying let
[1:27:56] my people go and there's now a contest
[1:28:00] and then now God says and and the reason
[1:28:02] that all those plagues fall in Egypt on
[1:28:04] the Nile and and everything that's
[1:28:05] happened is God is bringing judgment
[1:28:08] down on the gods Amen on the gods of the
[1:28:11] Egyptians and then now and then he
[1:28:13] finally brings the last plague he brings
[1:28:15] his death amen because is because
[1:28:18] there's a there's a dispute going on and
[1:28:21] God is actually saying now you have to
[1:28:23] let them go they're my property I'm
[1:28:25] going to make you let them go amen and
[1:28:27] eventually it comes to a spot where Mo
[1:28:30] Pharaoh says take the get out with
[1:28:32] whatever you want just just get out of
[1:28:33] the country amen because Moses plagues
[1:28:38] Egypt until finally finally Israel
[1:28:42] actually they have to acknowledge
[1:28:44] they're not our slaves take them they're
[1:28:46] actually God's people amen amen and
[1:28:49] because Redemption so Redemption must
[1:28:52] happen through a person and in those
[1:28:54] days of Moses it happened through Moses
[1:28:57] and Redemption has to be by Blood so
[1:29:00] life has to be given blood has to be
[1:29:03] shed and that's the purchasing price to
[1:29:05] actually lay claim on it but then
[1:29:08] Redemption is also through Power amen
[1:29:12] because there has to be a force on God's
[1:29:14] end saying this is my property amen it's
[1:29:18] not just a mental arithmetic or whatever
[1:29:20] saying oh yes I'm redeemed but God comes
[1:29:23] down that's why there's always such a
[1:29:25] there's always such a battle you comeing
[1:29:27] amongst the truth and literally all hell
[1:29:29] breaks loose why because the because the
[1:29:32] truth is being ministered and Faith
[1:29:34] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:29:35] of God so Faith begins to rise that you
[1:29:38] begin to and your eyes begin to come
[1:29:40] open I'm a son or daughter of God Amen
[1:29:42] I'm not just born in this world and
[1:29:44] these are my natural parents you begin
[1:29:46] to actually recognize amen amen you be
[1:29:48] because Faith Rises you begin to
[1:29:50] recognize I'm from Heaven amen I have no
[1:29:53] part of Satan all this world I'm I'm a
[1:29:55] part of God hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:29:57] that begins to rise and it's like
[1:29:59] Pharaoh putting the pressure on on you
[1:30:02] you on the Israelites they have to get
[1:30:04] their own straw I'm going to make it
[1:30:06] harder for them to make bricks and mean
[1:30:08] pressure comes down why is that because
[1:30:11] they're Rising they're rising from
[1:30:13] slavery into sunship thank you Lord
[1:30:16] hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:30:18] remember this is a spiritual battle this
[1:30:21] is not a picnic amen that's why you know
[1:30:25] don't find it strange when all the fiery
[1:30:27] Trials come and the hardship comes and
[1:30:30] the battles come amen because it's
[1:30:33] actually the devil and he'll use whoever
[1:30:34] he can and he'll and he'll put pressure
[1:30:37] on you are you going to Bow I'm going to
[1:30:39] make you bow amen and you're not going
[1:30:42] to like it and I'm going to beat you in
[1:30:44] such a way you'll never want to try it
[1:30:46] again he's a slave master
[1:30:49] friends it's not a fluffy duck he's a
[1:30:52] slave master amen but then you've got to
[1:30:55] recognize all that is because he's a
[1:30:58] he's afraid he's afraid if you rise to
[1:31:00] your position he becomes your life and
[1:31:04] you've got to tell him what to do amen
[1:31:06] it's just like Moses I've said it before
[1:31:08] what the first thing Moses did before
[1:31:10] Pharaoh remember Pharaoh the
[1:31:12] representation of pharaoh was the king
[1:31:14] cobra that's right amen he he has like
[1:31:17] one or two of them on his on his uh
[1:31:19] headdress and there the first thing do
[1:31:21] is Moses tells Aaron throw down the rod
[1:31:23] and it becomes a the Cobra picks it up
[1:31:25] by the tail again and it becomes a rod
[1:31:28] again and God is showing Pharaoh I can
[1:31:30] loose you I can bind you I can loose you
[1:31:33] I can bind you I can do whatever I want
[1:31:35] with you Pharaoh amen you're loosed and
[1:31:38] now you're bound you're loosed and now
[1:31:39] you're bound Hallelujah and it's the
[1:31:42] same thing with the bride of Jesus
[1:31:43] Christ amen you got to recognize that
[1:31:45] there's power in your tongue you can
[1:31:48] loose Satan and you can bind Satan amen
[1:31:51] he is under your Authority hallelujah
[1:31:53] we're not slaves anymore friends we're
[1:31:55] Sons and Daughters of God Amen by the
[1:31:57] blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord
[1:32:00] hallelujah so it's by Blood and it's by
[1:32:03] power amen and our Redemption wasn't
[1:32:06] just from slavery naturally amen but our
[1:32:09] Redemption was from slavery
[1:32:11] spiritually hallelujah we're free people
[1:32:14] and I that's why I said in the beginning
[1:32:16] don't look at the situation you find
[1:32:18] yourself in look in whom your whom your
[1:32:21] father is thank you Lord amen look at
[1:32:24] whom your father is so it's by power so
[1:32:27] now the blood redeems the believer of
[1:32:29] all the guilt and penalty of sin yes and
[1:32:33] then the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:35] delivers you from the Dominion of sin
[1:32:39] amen hallelujah amen so now those two
[1:32:44] things we're being Redeemed by the blood
[1:32:46] of the lamb but then the life that was
[1:32:49] in his blood is now released upon you
[1:32:51] and gives you the power that sin you are
[1:32:54] not a slave to sin anymore but now sin
[1:32:57] is under your feet amen you say well
[1:33:00] I've got these battles just just just
[1:33:03] keep fighting you say well I've got a
[1:33:05] lot of opposition just kill one at a
[1:33:07] time amen focus on the first devil then
[1:33:10] kill the next devil then kill the next
[1:33:12] devil just keep
[1:33:14] fighting amen just like the children of
[1:33:16] Israel coming into the promised land
[1:33:18] they had to take Jordan then they took
[1:33:20] AI then they took another city and
[1:33:22] another city and they fought another
[1:33:24] battle they just kept going yes amen
[1:33:26] amen Caleb and Joshua they didn't care
[1:33:29] how small they how the rest of them
[1:33:31] thought or how big the enemy was God's
[1:33:33] given us the land am that part of the
[1:33:35] Redemption was now we're going to
[1:33:37] possess our land and they possess their
[1:33:39] land and if that was under the blood of
[1:33:40] bulls and goats how much are people
[1:33:42] under the blood of Jesus
[1:33:44] Christ Amen brother Braham says in the
[1:33:46] breach message he says he says about
[1:33:48] Moses saying let there be flies and
[1:33:50] there was flies and let there be frogs
[1:33:51] there was frogs and he says if a man can
[1:33:53] do that under the blood of bulls and
[1:33:54] goats how much more are people under the
[1:33:56] blood of Jesus Christ that God has
[1:33:58] bridged the chasm between God and man
[1:34:01] Hallelujah and he said now that could be
[1:34:02] a real text that's right hallelujah how
[1:34:05] much more now there's no Gulf between
[1:34:07] you and God amen amen the blood puts us
[1:34:10] on speaking terms again Hallelujah
[1:34:13] you've got to speak to your
[1:34:15] Mountain
[1:34:18] amen now so Redemption is by Blood it
[1:34:21] must be through a person and and God
[1:34:24] became Our Redeemer and it must be by
[1:34:27] Blood and he shed his blood and it must
[1:34:29] be by power and that's the power of the
[1:34:30] Holy Ghost amen all right and
[1:34:35] now we have I want to
[1:34:38] read let's go to Hebrews chapter
[1:34:49] 9 and we're reading verses 14 to 17
[1:34:54] now
[1:34:56] remember Paul in this book of Hebrews is
[1:34:58] saying we have greater and you got to
[1:35:01] understand the bride of Christ in this
[1:35:03] age has greater than previous ages okay
[1:35:06] because it's God's season to do certain
[1:35:09] things amen they still be there they're
[1:35:12] still going in a Rapture but the book of
[1:35:14] Hebrews says but them without us cannot
[1:35:17] be made perfect or complete so there has
[1:35:21] to be a people maybe let's just read
[1:35:23] this I mean I'll just mention this
[1:35:24] before we read Hebrews chapter 9 now in
[1:35:27] the Old Testament those who died under
[1:35:29] the blood of bulls and goats they were
[1:35:32] waiting for someone to come to clear
[1:35:35] their sin debt because the blood of
[1:35:37] balls and goats just covered their sin
[1:35:40] that's why they went into a place called
[1:35:42] Paradise they but they had to wait for
[1:35:45] someone to come with a real purchasing
[1:35:48] power that didn't just cover their sin
[1:35:50] but annihilated it CU remember Satan had
[1:35:52] claims on them Satan had claims on Moses
[1:35:54] oh he's got a temper Satan had claims on
[1:35:57] even Abel and everyone down through amen
[1:36:00] because everyone is born in a fallen
[1:36:03] State amen and through that Fallen state
[1:36:06] that is Satan's claims on you that's
[1:36:08] right amen so all the True Believers in
[1:36:11] the Old Testament Satan still had claims
[1:36:13] on them amen even though the blood that
[1:36:16] God instituted through the blood of
[1:36:17] bulls and goats it still covered their
[1:36:19] sin so they weren't lost but they were
[1:36:22] waiting for some a man had to come a man
[1:36:25] caused the fall so a man had to
[1:36:28] redeem amen so they're waiting for a man
[1:36:31] to come that could be the Redeemer that
[1:36:33] could undo everything that they were
[1:36:36] born with and wipe it clean amen and so
[1:36:39] when Jesus came amen they're waiting for
[1:36:42] him to come they had seen him in many
[1:36:44] different forms down through the Old
[1:36:46] Testament but now he was in flesh
[1:36:48] Hallelujah and then now in Matthew 27 it
[1:36:51] says when he arose many of the Saints
[1:36:54] arose with him amen and then he says he
[1:36:58] took captivity
[1:36:59] captive amen and he and he went up into
[1:37:02] Glory he ascended on high and lad
[1:37:04] captivity captive so all the Believers
[1:37:06] of the Old Testament were in Paradise
[1:37:08] they weren't in torment they're in
[1:37:10] Paradise but they needed someone to come
[1:37:12] to wipe their de cing amen so here was
[1:37:15] Jesus now with with the blood to do it
[1:37:18] Hallelujah not the blood of an animal
[1:37:20] but the blood of God now and he pays the
[1:37:23] price on full amen and then he goes into
[1:37:25] paradise and he empties Paradise out so
[1:37:29] they are all waiting cuz remember there
[1:37:30] were claims on them but then Jesus came
[1:37:33] and actually struck all the claims off
[1:37:34] saying they belong to me and Satan lost
[1:37:37] all claim he had on the old test Saints
[1:37:40] amen hallelujah so but them them by
[1:37:44] themselves were not perfect or complete
[1:37:46] without Jesus
[1:37:48] coming amen amen they were waiting for
[1:37:51] him to come
[1:37:53] to pay the price amen that's why when he
[1:37:57] arose when he shed his blood it was
[1:37:59] wiping all the claims Satan had against
[1:38:01] them out amen amen so then when he arose
[1:38:05] the Saints of old arose with him and
[1:38:09] went up into glory amen hallelujah amen
[1:38:12] but now there Comes A Time so so the
[1:38:15] first so so so now the day of Pentecost
[1:38:19] comes and
[1:38:23] Braham says in the Easter
[1:38:26] seal he says now remember these they all
[1:38:29] believe Jesus died on Calvary yep they
[1:38:32] accepted what he did but now the life
[1:38:35] that was in him had to come into
[1:38:37] them and he says notice that Pentecost
[1:38:40] their bodies were quickened by the new
[1:38:42] life they received he says that makes me
[1:38:43] feel religious think uh here were men
[1:38:46] fishermen Tax Collectors The Humble
[1:38:48] little woman of ordinary Housewives
[1:38:51] little virgin girls they were believers
[1:38:53] they were were believing that this was
[1:38:54] the truth they believed that when Jesus
[1:38:57] died they believed on him and Rose up
[1:38:59] again from the dead they believed that
[1:39:02] to be absolutely the testimony of God
[1:39:04] that he had quickened them to life now
[1:39:07] they go up to the day of Pentecost to
[1:39:09] receive their
[1:39:10] abstract do you know what an abstract is
[1:39:14] it's when a deed has been cleared amen
[1:39:17] so he says so an abstract title deed is
[1:39:20] now a deed like for example this is just
[1:39:25] say this is a deed to a house then there
[1:39:27] has to be a search now does anyone lay
[1:39:29] claims on the house and if no one has
[1:39:32] any claims or the claims are not settled
[1:39:35] I mean sorry if the claims have been
[1:39:37] settled and there's no claims against it
[1:39:39] then it can be sold amen but before that
[1:39:43] it cannot be sold because there's claims
[1:39:46] are you following me amen so there comes
[1:39:49] a point now
[1:39:51] so now it says now when they go up to
[1:39:54] the day of Pentecost they receive the
[1:39:56] abstract do you know what an abstract is
[1:39:58] it's when a deed has been cleared they
[1:40:01] went up there to receive their abstract
[1:40:03] and they were quickened so he says Oh
[1:40:05] What A Thrill they had brought the land
[1:40:08] had been brought for them they had
[1:40:10] received it he says is it true or not he
[1:40:12] says we seen them raise up but now what
[1:40:14] about us we Are Witnesses we seen stood
[1:40:17] the man crucified we seen the clouds
[1:40:20] come over the Earth and darken the skies
[1:40:22] the earthquake and chook there was a
[1:40:24] nervous
[1:40:25] prostration but they put him in the
[1:40:27] grave they Spar him in the side with the
[1:40:29] I mean I mean Spar him in the heart with
[1:40:31] a spear and they took his body down laid
[1:40:33] him in the grave of of Joseph arthea and
[1:40:36] then they find out that on the third day
[1:40:38] he raised up again and as the disciple
[1:40:40] said we Are Witnesses of this we' seen
[1:40:43] him raise up we know he's alive but then
[1:40:47] now they had something had to come down
[1:40:49] from heaven now to show that the clay
[1:40:53] that Satan had on them had been struck
[1:40:56] off amen that their Redemption had been
[1:40:59] paid for so now that's why he said he
[1:41:02] went they went up to day of Pentecost
[1:41:04] they received the abstract they received
[1:41:05] the Holy Ghost amen and so when they
[1:41:08] received the Holy Ghost God was actually
[1:41:11] showing them I have purchased your
[1:41:14] salvation but now by him coming dwelling
[1:41:17] in in you I'm actually showing now that
[1:41:20] the devil has no right to hold anything
[1:41:23] against you amen because when you
[1:41:25] receive the Holy Ghost what's happening
[1:41:27] you're thoroughly repented of everything
[1:41:29] you've surrendered your life completely
[1:41:30] to the word amen then God looks down on
[1:41:33] that and he wipes away everything that
[1:41:35] Satan could hold against you hallelujah
[1:41:38] amen amen that's what it means by the
[1:41:40] coming of the abstract so now because
[1:41:42] you must you must understand if you have
[1:41:45] been if you really know the Lord anyone
[1:41:49] here amen amen amen if you've been
[1:41:52] sealed into the kingdom by the the Holy
[1:41:53] Spirit which is the same thing then God
[1:41:57] has forgiven you of past present and
[1:42:00] future sinj amen remember if we sin if
[1:42:04] we confess our sins he's faithful and
[1:42:06] just to forgive us amen but by God
[1:42:08] sending down the abstract amen by God
[1:42:12] giving you the Holy Ghost he's actually
[1:42:13] showing remember if there's sin Satan
[1:42:15] has claim that's why he says now I've
[1:42:18] actually eradicated that Amen to show
[1:42:22] that I forgiven you have past present
[1:42:24] future sin amen are you with me amen are
[1:42:28] we all here amen amen you got to
[1:42:30] understand that if you're a new creature
[1:42:32] in Christ God has forgiven you of
[1:42:34] everything thank you Lord amen and
[1:42:36] there's something in us that when we do
[1:42:38] wrong we say Lord forgive me and if we
[1:42:41] do that he's faithful and just to
[1:42:42] forgive us says in first John chapter 1
[1:42:46] Hallelujah so they received they re
[1:42:50] received their abstract title
[1:42:53] now let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 sorry
[1:42:56] I was want to
[1:43:02] go Hebrews 9:14 and
[1:43:09] 17 but you see actually before we read
[1:43:12] this sorry I said that before but before
[1:43:13] we read this but now what happens is you
[1:43:16] come to Acts chapter 15 and there are
[1:43:19] false Brethren come in saying we have to
[1:43:21] observe the law and there's a big
[1:43:23] dispute so what's happening now because
[1:43:26] if if Satan can get you to believe
[1:43:29] something that's wrong if you have false
[1:43:32] doctrine of or belief then he has claim
[1:43:34] on you amen he has claim on you and so
[1:43:38] now false Brethren came in say that
[1:43:41] weren't weren't fully born again like
[1:43:44] the like Acts chapter 2 and they said
[1:43:46] well we need to we need to still do
[1:43:48] parts of the
[1:43:49] law amen and so now there was a dispute
[1:43:52] and then from there on then there became
[1:43:54] a decline where the church started in
[1:43:57] Pentecost but ended up in the dark ages
[1:44:00] amen and false Doctrine came and Trinity
[1:44:03] and all these different you know
[1:44:04] sprinkling babies instead of baptizing
[1:44:07] you know repentant people in the name of
[1:44:08] the Lord Jesus Christ all the things you
[1:44:11] know that are not scriptural but by the
[1:44:14] devil injecting those in now he had
[1:44:16] claim amen amen so there had to come a
[1:44:20] time
[1:44:21] now but all the True Believers are going
[1:44:24] to be there okay but they without us
[1:44:29] canot be made perfect now Jesus and
[1:44:32] that's why I use the illustration with
[1:44:33] Jesus in the Old Testament remember we
[1:44:34] don't have to pay for any salvation amen
[1:44:37] but Jesus had to come to make them
[1:44:39] complete amen amen and then so there has
[1:44:43] to come a people that come to their
[1:44:45] position in Christ amen amen when the
[1:44:48] word is made manifested completely and
[1:44:51] when we come to that position
[1:44:53] amen then they become
[1:44:56] Complete because when we come to our
[1:44:59] position then the dead in Christ rise
[1:45:02] amen why why hasn't there been a Rapture
[1:45:04] yet because God is molding and shaping
[1:45:06] and preparing us and then we when we
[1:45:09] come to our position then the gener I
[1:45:12] mean then the dead in Christ raise so
[1:45:14] they're waiting for us and with us then
[1:45:17] without us canot be made
[1:45:19] perfect
[1:45:21] amen so
[1:45:23] now let's read this here where Hebrews
[1:45:25] chapter
[1:45:28] 9:14 how much
[1:45:31] more right let's go from verse
[1:45:35] 13 for if the blood of bulls and and of
[1:45:37] goats and of Ashes of a heer sprinkled
[1:45:40] uh sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to
[1:45:42] the purifying of the flesh how much more
[1:45:44] shall the blood of
[1:45:46] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[1:45:48] offered himself without spot uh to God
[1:45:51] Purge your conscience from the dead
[1:45:53] Works to serve the Living God for this
[1:45:55] cause he is the mediator of the New
[1:45:57] Testament that by means of death for the
[1:46:00] Redemption of the transgressions that
[1:46:02] were under the first testament they
[1:46:05] which are called might receive the
[1:46:07] promise of e of Eternal inheritance for
[1:46:10] where a testament is there must also of
[1:46:13] necessity be the death of the
[1:46:15] testator for a testament is a force
[1:46:18] after men are dead remember Testament is
[1:46:20] a
[1:46:21] will otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:46:25] all while the testator liveth whereupon
[1:46:28] neither the first testament was
[1:46:31] dedicated without blood for when Moses
[1:46:34] had spoken every precept to all the
[1:46:36] people according to the law he took the
[1:46:37] blood of calves and of goats with water
[1:46:39] and Scarlet wood uh and hisop and
[1:46:42] sprinkle both the book and all the
[1:46:44] people saying this is the blood of the
[1:46:46] testament which God hath enjoined uh
[1:46:49] unto you moreover he sprinkled the blood
[1:46:52] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[1:46:53] of the ministry and almost all things
[1:46:55] are by the law purged with blood and
[1:46:57] without shedding of blood is no
[1:47:00] remission so they received an abstract
[1:47:04] title in the day of
[1:47:05] Pentecost but there was still the
[1:47:07] fullness of redemption was the change of
[1:47:10] the body as we read okay so when when
[1:47:15] Jesus you know you know we read here now
[1:47:17] that a testament or a will can only be
[1:47:19] enforced when the person's dead right
[1:47:23] but then now in our case Jesus didn't
[1:47:26] just die to give us what's in the will
[1:47:30] but he arose again to ensure what's in
[1:47:33] the will is given to
[1:47:34] you okay but they had to come it so but
[1:47:39] the fullness of that will went back into
[1:47:42] the hands of the original owner okay you
[1:47:45] following me I'm just going to tie this
[1:47:46] all together I hope by the help of the
[1:47:48] Lord and so the fullness of that Will
[1:47:51] was up in the hands of the original
[1:47:52] owner
[1:47:53] okay so the Believers all the way down
[1:47:56] through received eternal life yeah but
[1:48:00] they had to come a time now where all
[1:48:02] claims against the bride of Christ are
[1:48:05] wiped
[1:48:06] out
[1:48:08] yeah and
[1:48:11] so they had parts of the will I'll put
[1:48:15] it this way this is just my terminology
[1:48:17] this is just me they had parts of the
[1:48:19] will cuz they had eternal life they were
[1:48:21] given overcoming power to overcome the
[1:48:23] works of the enemy in their age but they
[1:48:25] had not received a body
[1:48:26] change
[1:48:29] okay but
[1:48:30] now there comes a season where
[1:48:34] everything Adam lost is fully restored
[1:48:36] back into the hands of man that's right
[1:48:38] amen So Adam controlled the World by the
[1:48:42] power of the spoken word amen because
[1:48:45] the second Adam demonstrated everything
[1:48:48] that the first Adam lost he had dominion
[1:48:51] over nature everything was subject to
[1:48:53] his
[1:48:54] voice amen so he was demonstrating this
[1:48:57] is what Adam lost I'm now demonstrating
[1:48:59] it and so if that was the case of the
[1:49:01] second Adam then there has to come a
[1:49:04] people a second Eve that demonstrates
[1:49:08] everything as well that the second Adam
[1:49:11] did for them yes amen okay so the same
[1:49:14] Ministry that the first Adam had
[1:49:16] dominion over all things remember we
[1:49:18] overcome the world Amen Satan be under
[1:49:21] your feet amen amen all things will be
[1:49:25] placed under your feet and so there has
[1:49:27] to come a season where that word is
[1:49:30] manifested amen I trust you know and
[1:49:32] we're living in the
[1:49:34] hour amen so there Comes A Time now
[1:49:37] where there's a people upon the Earth
[1:49:40] and they demonstrate everything the
[1:49:42] first Adam and Eve did by Dominion
[1:49:44] because remember if you're an air with
[1:49:46] Christ you're joint I mean you're if
[1:49:47] you're part of him you joint ear amen so
[1:49:50] everything he received you fall ear too
[1:49:52] because of what he did amen amen so now
[1:49:55] there is a people there is a people now
[1:49:57] upon the Earth amen upon the Earth right
[1:49:59] now that have the power within them amen
[1:50:04] to bring everything under their Dominion
[1:50:06] yes amen amen now this is not pie and
[1:50:09] the sky we are now living in the season
[1:50:12] of the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:50:14] the revealing of the sons of God we're
[1:50:16] living in that season we're living out
[1:50:18] that season amen amen I said a while ago
[1:50:21] you know a people cannot live any
[1:50:23] different to the anointing they have
[1:50:25] received amen so if we're Anointed with
[1:50:27] the Holy Ghost to do certain things
[1:50:28] we're going to do those certain things
[1:50:31] you following me and so now there has to
[1:50:33] come a time where the fullness of the
[1:50:36] title is
[1:50:37] taken amen so now John John at the end
[1:50:41] of the seventh Church age and he
[1:50:43] represents the bride of Christ he's
[1:50:46] taken up into a Heavenly realm and he
[1:50:49] sees that book in the right hands of him
[1:50:52] that sat upon on the throne and he wept
[1:50:54] much cuz he couldn't see anyone worthy
[1:50:56] to take back everything that Adam lost
[1:50:59] remember he rested on joh uh uh he
[1:51:01] rested on jesus' bosom he was called The
[1:51:03] Beloved disciple he saw Jesus hanging
[1:51:06] between heavens and earth paying for his
[1:51:08] um salvation but he recognized if no one
[1:51:11] was found worthy to take back everything
[1:51:13] Adam lost the whole creation was still
[1:51:16] undone and
[1:51:18] lost but then he saw the lamb step forth
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] and he said weep not John for the lon of
[1:51:25] the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's
[1:51:27] found worthy to be open the seals and
[1:51:29] then when John turned he look he saw a
[1:51:31] lamb remember it's all symbolic cuz
[1:51:34] Lambs don't have hands and seven horns
[1:51:35] and seven eyes amen but speaking of Our
[1:51:38] Redeemer he couldn't find a man he
[1:51:41] couldn't see a man worthy enough to
[1:51:42] redeem everything that Adam lost and
[1:51:44] then now but then out of the eternities
[1:51:47] comes our lord Jesus hallelujah amen
[1:51:50] who's been intercessing who's been
[1:51:52] intercessor on the behalf of the Saints
[1:51:54] he steps
[1:51:55] forth amen and then now he takes the
[1:52:00] book and so now what's happening now is
[1:52:03] beforehand remember I said there were
[1:52:05] claims on the book even though it was in
[1:52:07] the hands of the original owner Satan
[1:52:09] says well I cause him to fall
[1:52:12] it's Amen that's why he's the prince of
[1:52:14] the power of the year he controls nature
[1:52:17] because he's laying Adam used to control
[1:52:19] nature but he forfeited his position and
[1:52:22] now that's why Satan's in control of
[1:52:24] this world Amen and so he's actually
[1:52:28] even though he can't take it he says
[1:52:29] it's mine because I've got claims on
[1:52:31] Adam's Fallen race and but then now the
[1:52:34] lamb the second Adam steps forth because
[1:52:37] he has the blood he purchased it on
[1:52:38] Calvary but now he steps forth and takes
[1:52:41] the
[1:52:42] deed Hallelujah and by laying Claim by
[1:52:46] taking the book he's actually he's
[1:52:48] actually demonstrating there is no claim
[1:52:51] am mean all the the claims have been
[1:52:53] struck off the book he I trust this
[1:52:56] means something to you I know you're
[1:52:57] listening very quietly but I trust it
[1:52:59] means something to you because he could
[1:53:01] not take that book if there was a claim
[1:53:03] against the book amen but by his own
[1:53:05] blood he wiped out every claim
[1:53:08] Hallelujah and then he takes the book to
[1:53:11] himself so he takes the fullness of the
[1:53:13] will everything Adam lost and then he
[1:53:15] looses the seal so he opens the contents
[1:53:17] of the book amen and then he begins to
[1:53:19] speak it out hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:53:22] and that's why when you have remember
[1:53:24] John it says in Revelations 10 I was
[1:53:26] about to write what those seven Thunders
[1:53:29] uttered but God said write it not but
[1:53:31] seal it up until the time of the end so
[1:53:33] there was a part of the will that was
[1:53:35] actually held back amen Until the End
[1:53:38] Time amen but then now now comes the
[1:53:42] season Hallelujah now comes the season
[1:53:45] where that which was sealed up in the
[1:53:47] word those seven Thunders has now spoken
[1:53:51] and brother bam says the seven Thunders
[1:53:53] is the revelation of the Seven
[1:53:55] Seals amen so everything in the
[1:53:59] seals remember when when Jesus said glor
[1:54:02] I've glorified thy name I'll glorify it
[1:54:04] again no Jesus said glorify me with the
[1:54:06] glory I had before the foundation of the
[1:54:08] world and a voice spake Out of Heaven
[1:54:10] I've glorified it and I'll glorify it
[1:54:12] again some Heard a Voice some heard a
[1:54:14] thunder so what's a thunder it's the
[1:54:16] voice of God that's not
[1:54:17] interpreted amen that's that's not
[1:54:20] understood so it was a thunder but now
[1:54:22] it's not a thunder now it's a voice yes
[1:54:24] am amen so that's why the seven Thunders
[1:54:27] is the Revelation contained in the Seven
[1:54:28] Seals it's not another thing I just want
[1:54:32] to say this right now we're not looking
[1:54:34] for those seven Thunders to utter amen
[1:54:37] amen some people say we're going to have
[1:54:38] a seven Thunders Revival the bride is
[1:54:41] because brother Ram says well the seven
[1:54:43] Thunders nothing's nothing's come that
[1:54:45] will awaken the bride we're still
[1:54:46] waiting for those seven Thunders but
[1:54:48] then after that he says he says why do
[1:54:51] the people all they PR say fast and pray
[1:54:53] fast and pray F you know sound of
[1:54:54] trumpet it's going to be a new Breaking
[1:54:56] of the day fast and pray fast and pray
[1:54:58] he says why do they do that they're good
[1:55:00] people they feel the pull of the hour
[1:55:02] being Christians but he says they have
[1:55:03] missed the Awakening of the Bride yes
[1:55:06] amen amen and it was Jack Moore one of
[1:55:08] his managers who was actually missing
[1:55:10] the whole thing they says they're good
[1:55:12] people they're sincere people but
[1:55:13] they've missed the Awakening of the
[1:55:15] Bride so what is he saying he's saying
[1:55:18] that those seven Thunders have uttered
[1:55:21] because the bride has been awakened a
[1:55:23] Revival is an Awakening amen amen amen
[1:55:26] so we're not looking for those those
[1:55:28] things cuz some people are still uh and
[1:55:30] I'll just say this very simply if the if
[1:55:32] the seals if Christ has become real amen
[1:55:36] if the seals have become open to you
[1:55:38] then you're having a Revival if the word
[1:55:40] has become open to some people it's
[1:55:42] still a
[1:55:44] thunder but to others it's a voice amen
[1:55:47] and when God speaks it causes people to
[1:55:50] come into their position amen hallelujah
[1:55:53] praise God that's why some people still
[1:55:55] have the dispute is the seventh seal
[1:55:56] closed or open well to some it's still
[1:55:58] closed but to me it's open amen amen
[1:56:01] because I've seen the lamb step forth
[1:56:03] amen hallelujah amen and so now so that
[1:56:07] part of the will was held
[1:56:09] back
[1:56:12] okay it says in Hebrews 1 and
[1:56:15] one one and two
[1:56:17] sorry I know I've said these things
[1:56:19] before but you
[1:56:24] verse three who being the brightness of
[1:56:27] his glory and the expressed image of his
[1:56:30] person and upholding All Things by the
[1:56:34] word of his power when he had himself
[1:56:38] purged our sins sat down on the right
[1:56:40] hand of the Majesty on high now notice
[1:56:43] it doesn't say upholding All Things by
[1:56:44] the power of His word but it's by the
[1:56:47] word of his power yes what does that
[1:56:50] mean when God releases a word he's
[1:56:53] releasing
[1:56:54] power okay so every age a word has been
[1:56:58] released and it releases a power to help
[1:57:01] the people overcome what the enemy is
[1:57:03] doing hallelujah amen so then now when
[1:57:06] the seals have come open when the
[1:57:07] Thunders have uted he is releasing a
[1:57:10] power to the church through that word
[1:57:13] amen that that was held back until this
[1:57:16] end time and that's why I say there's
[1:57:19] part of the part of the will
[1:57:22] okay that was held back until the end
[1:57:24] time amen and so that's why that's why
[1:57:28] now we' have come to an age that we're
[1:57:30] living in and you live in it every day
[1:57:33] amen where God has released a power
[1:57:36] through his word am so we can take a
[1:57:39] body
[1:57:40] change amen so everything that Adam lost
[1:57:44] is now back in your possession amen
[1:57:47] hallelujah because I know it's all
[1:57:50] symbolic but Revelations 10 the book
[1:57:52] that's opened by the lamb it doesn't
[1:57:54] stay in the Lamb's hand right amen it
[1:57:57] ends up in you amen it ends up in the
[1:57:59] bride so the bride manifests what is in
[1:58:03] the
[1:58:04] will it's like if just like if I died I
[1:58:07] left you all uh you know your your house
[1:58:10] or whatever I left you if you go and
[1:58:12] possess the house you're manifesting
[1:58:14] what's in the will amen amen you're
[1:58:17] manifesting it and it's the same thing
[1:58:18] today now God has his will and he's
[1:58:21] opened it and he's released it through
[1:58:23] his word and now by because of power
[1:58:25] comes in through that word and you have
[1:58:27] faith to live it it lives in you what's
[1:58:30] happening out you manifest what's in the
[1:58:34] will I trust I'm not
[1:58:37] speaking some other language right now
[1:58:40] yeah you understand amen we're living in
[1:58:42] a season for the Redemption of the body
[1:58:45] amen amen and God has released a power
[1:58:48] through his word that we can walk into
[1:58:50] that position yes
[1:58:53] Hallelujah because part of the will that
[1:58:56] they didn't have you have
[1:59:01] hallelujah amen and that is why that is
[1:59:04] why
[1:59:05] friends that is why the world is waiting
[1:59:09] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:59:12] and you happen to be that
[1:59:14] manifestation amen that's why I said
[1:59:17] before now I need some musicians to come
[1:59:19] because we're out of time but that's why
[1:59:21] I said before when John the Baptist came
[1:59:24] what he looked like and what the
[1:59:25] prophecies were they seemed like two
[1:59:27] very different things that's exactly
[1:59:29] what God wanted them to
[1:59:31] be okay
[1:59:34] so don't get caught up in a trap where
[1:59:37] you feel you should be something else
[1:59:40] that's why brother R says just live a
[1:59:41] humble simple Christian Life just walk
[1:59:44] with
[1:59:45] God Amen you know brother Braham when he
[1:59:48] when he had the manifestations of the
[1:59:50] third pole he spoke the Scrolls into
[1:59:53] existence the tumor out of existence the
[1:59:55] storm out of existence gave the fish its
[1:59:57] life back had he writes two sons
[1:59:59] received eternal life
[2:00:01] amen that wasn't him willing things to
[2:00:05] happen it was actually he said if
[2:00:07] without an anointing come down when he's
[2:00:09] hunting the first says what do you need
[2:00:10] God says what do you
[2:00:12] need you hunting squirrels how many do
[2:00:14] you want or five where do you want them
[2:00:16] to come it was all God initiating it
[2:00:20] amen but there was the need there and
[2:00:22] then that power that was already in the
[2:00:24] prophet became activated amen so it was
[2:00:28] in there because remember if you have
[2:00:29] the Holy Ghost in you you have the power
[2:00:32] within you to speak a world into
[2:00:34] existence and go live a private life on
[2:00:35] it you have that power but that power is
[2:00:38] is is governed by a law and that law is
[2:00:42] the will of God amen amen so when the
[2:00:46] need and that's why just just have
[2:00:48] confidence in God when a challenge comes
[2:00:51] your way
[2:00:52] God will cause you to rise to the
[2:00:55] occasion amen because you have the
[2:00:57] anointing within you when the enemy
[2:00:59] comes in like a flood I'll raise up a
[2:01:01] standard and that standard is the bride
[2:01:03] of Christ amen amen it's in you it's
[2:01:05] risen up Hallelujah so he had a
[2:01:10] need and God anointed him and gave him
[2:01:12] that
[2:01:13] need to show that the god of creation
[2:01:16] was now on the Earth again amen amen but
[2:01:20] it wasn't it was and it's just like his
[2:01:23] wife's tumor they prayed they fasted
[2:01:26] they Anointed with oil but then it came
[2:01:28] down to the time amen they still went
[2:01:30] the medical way as well amen but then it
[2:01:33] was actually God said now speak it it'll
[2:01:35] be amen amen because that power was
[2:01:39] there but at the right time in the right
[2:01:42] seasonall then he said when she when the
[2:01:45] surgeon gohost to cut her might
[2:01:47] disappear then a grapefruit size tumor
[2:01:49] just
[2:01:50] went and amen amen so we have the power
[2:01:54] I just want to say we have that power
[2:01:56] within us amen so much more to you than
[2:01:59] meet the
[2:02:01] eye amen you got to know
[2:02:04] that because God has released us to us
[2:02:07] in this age
[2:02:10] amen I don't like that clock Brother
[2:02:12] Andy I
[2:02:14] agree it keeps
[2:02:16] moving but he took the
[2:02:19] book amen
[2:02:22] and the prophet now was used and he
[2:02:24] struck off all the false doctrine of the
[2:02:25] church amen amen so now Satan has no
[2:02:31] claim on you hallelujah amen so it's not
[2:02:34] just your sinlessly perfect but he took
[2:02:36] a man he took a Ministry and he and he
[2:02:39] eradicated all the false Doctrine
[2:02:41] because wher a false Doctrine Satan says
[2:02:42] I made them believe that they're mine
[2:02:45] amen so so he used that Ministry to
[2:02:47] eradicate all the false Doctrine out of
[2:02:49] the church so not so now there there's
[2:02:52] nothing holding you
[2:02:53] here hallelujah amen amen there's
[2:02:57] nothing Satan can't hold anything
[2:02:58] against you that's right remember
[2:03:00] brother Braham said you never did it in
[2:03:02] the first place you're Justified the
[2:03:04] first place is God's thought of you
[2:03:06] before the foundation of the world the
[2:03:08] first place is God's mind amen so when
[2:03:11] God thought of you whatever whatever we
[2:03:14] may be facing in life and battling with
[2:03:16] and maybe being overcome by God didn't
[2:03:19] think about us that way you never did it
[2:03:22] in the first place right amen where's
[2:03:25] the first place God's thinking of you
[2:03:27] amen that's why he said to Job where
[2:03:29] were you when I laid the foundation of
[2:03:30] the world and the sons of God and stars
[2:03:32] of God shouted for Joy where were you
[2:03:34] job then job began to realize I was with
[2:03:38] you amen he wasn't trying to make job
[2:03:40] feel little he's trying to get job to
[2:03:42] see you are in my mind shouting and
[2:03:44] rejoicing you were one of those
[2:03:47] Stars amen and that's why John he's
[2:03:50] taking pastor curtain of time there he
[2:03:53] sees the lamb take the book and open the
[2:03:55] seals and then brother ad said John must
[2:03:57] have seen
[2:03:59] John amen and that's why he rejoiced cuz
[2:04:01] he saw himself up there amen hallelujah
[2:04:05] and that's what happens when the word
[2:04:07] comes open you see you Mama it's
[2:04:11] me
[2:04:15] amen and that that is that is the season
[2:04:19] we're we're alive in so just walk with
[2:04:23] God Amen walk with God Amen let him
[2:04:26] prove his salvation in your life amen
[2:04:30] he's the one who has to prove remember
[2:04:32] we are
[2:04:34] like I'm I'm I'm going to stop but
[2:04:37] that's like this you know we have a
[2:04:39] whose Bible is this whose Bible is it
[2:04:43] and you say well it's yours but what if
[2:04:45] someone says no it's mine this is like
[2:04:47] we're just property but you know and God
[2:04:49] I'm trying to use this analogy but to
[2:04:51] God we're not property but Satan think
[2:04:52] for property but it's basically you know
[2:04:54] there's a claim the Bible can't say I
[2:04:56] belong to Ben it has no voice amen so
[2:04:59] it's whoever who says who does it belong
[2:05:02] to and God just well that's
[2:05:06] mine and it's not the Bible dictating
[2:05:08] whose hand it's in it's the person who
[2:05:10] lays claim on it that has the right to
[2:05:12] lay claim on it and it's that's why I
[2:05:14] said let God prove his salvation in your
[2:05:16] life cuz when he lays claim on you it's
[2:05:18] not you saying you know it's not you
[2:05:20] trying to hold on to God it's actually
[2:05:22] God saying this one's mine amen and the
[2:05:25] and the ones I have engraved in the palm
[2:05:27] of my hands I'll never forget them amen
[2:05:29] hallelujah that's why just let God prove
[2:05:32] his salvation let God prove who you are
[2:05:35] in him just walk with him he's the one
[2:05:38] who has to prove it thank you amen you
[2:05:42] have to surrender to his word and walk
[2:05:43] on that's all you need to
[2:05:45] do amen would you like to stand with me
[2:05:50] there's nothing held against us friends
[2:05:51] amen we're free people today Hallelujah
[2:05:54] you got to remember that hallelujah
