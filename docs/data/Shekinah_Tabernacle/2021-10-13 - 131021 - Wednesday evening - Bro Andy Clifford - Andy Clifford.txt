amen you know the spirit of the lord loves music hallelujah many stories and testimonies we can share of how god has come and visited us in the music and in the song hallelujah who can testify hallelujah amen there's living testimonies amen and there's biblical testimonies all the way through hallelujah yeah amen glory to his name well it's a great privilege and an honor as always to stand before the purchase of the blood of jesus christ and um yes you know as a minister we don't treat this lightly but this is a this is you know a great honor and we just yield to the lord and want to be and i'm very thankful for the opportunity and so can we just turn i want to i've got us some some slides to um just because we have a few little things there and i want to speak on well i don't i've renamed it it's just called national spirits and uh yeah you know oh my i don't think you can read that it says here born a kiwi born again an eagle amen hallelujah amen we'll get into it but let's just turn in our bibles to ephesians 6 12 hallelujah and then we'll have a you can have your seats after that and um i'll just move that oh somebody's helping me there thank you amen well it looked bigger on my screen it always does oh my well praise god i'll read it from here so it says here in ephesians 6 12 if you've got it there it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah two national spirits well ashley you know we come from many places in the world and um but actually when you move here you come under the jurisdiction of this one naturally speaking it's attached to the body it's attached to the flesh and the spirit gets caught up in between and but your flesh body your natural birth the natural part of you is connected in some way somewhat by influence to the national spirit of new zealand so when you move here you're coming under you not naturally speaking under the dominion or domain you could say of the influence of these spirits here and therefore if you let it go and you just just consume it you know and just follow it and and and and have your affections towards the new zealand national spirit you will become that you will it will start to materialize in your life but first it starts in your thinking and the way that you think and so tonight i want to talk a lot more about the mind you know and about how you're thinking because this is really where the issue or it starts right there you know in the mind and what you're thinking about all the time as the saying goes we are no higher than our thoughts and actually ultimately if you get the mind of christ you've got his thoughts amen amen and therefore you'll think like him and that is the whole objective of our walk is to have the mind of christ and to continue to go from glory to glory and walk until we're just thinking the same things as him on the wavelength who's heard that before we're on the wavelength amen we're on the frequency who likes to be on the frequency of the holy ghost amen and when you're thinking it's like you you can just pray and it's the will of god amen hallelujah well i you certainly won't get there if you start to employ the national spirit in new zealand oh my and there the new zealand national spirit is a she's a she's a whopper and we're gonna get into it my now the thing is you know we bring a lot of different um identities you could say naturally speaking now i'm gonna kind of we'll just go down the natural line a little bit but then we will we're going to hit the spiritual line because i believe that we're of another spirit amen we're of another culture we're of another national spirit and i happen to be a patriot of that national spirit who's a patriot of the heavenly national spirit amen you know we don't want to get all patriotic about new zealand or about america or about korea or south africa amen anyone else anywhere else here canada no we don't want to get patriotic amen about those things amen hallelujah maybe in the millennium and if you get to live there you can be patriotic then you know we'll have some fun amen but we all cleaned up by then you know amen hallelujah hallelujah so i want to just read um you know you're born a kiwi and i'm just gonna let's just pretend we're all born in new zealand okay you're born a kiwi and but you're born again a eagle and a kiwi can't fly but an eagle can fly amen and so you can see i don't know how that got past the the thinking filters of new zealand's identity it's a crisis it's an absolute crisis that that we call ourselves kiwis you know and oh my [Laughter] you know as at least america was thinking right you know when they identified with an eagle at least you know naturally speaking man i don't know what else other kind i've never really done research but you know there's always some sort of animal or some creature or something that these countries are represented by amen but you know for tonight we're just going to talk about the our what what pertains unto us here in new zealand and the principalities and the powers that are over uh new zealand you know there is dominions is you know the devil sets up a system like you see the government and you got the prime minister and you've got the ministers of the cabinet and you've got different levels well it just works like that in the spiritual realm as well and there's the devil places probably demons that do really good and do work really well or whatever he gives them a promotion and they get a nation over them because they do a good job at being evil and bad and they've got to they've managed to wrangle i don't know how they do it but anyway they managed to get themselves a position but then they have other ones under them and they've got ones for i mean there's definitely one and up heart and the up heart one is very it's very hard to deal with man sorry that is a real running joke for me and isaac and probably those that have been around for a while i won't go into it it might be it might come across as being discriminatory but thankfully we're not part of that you know we don't identify all that but you see what i'm trying to say is there is a hierarchical system that governs new zealand spiritually and it's like politics it kind of goes with what people are ascribing to and then it just capitalizes on certain natures of people and the way it was and they're like oh that's a good bondage i'm going to make the kiwi spirit like that and then we're going to promote that and they just push that and they they aggravate people to get agendas going and protest going that will bolster an evil way or a godless way and new zealand is a very it was it actually was based on you know religious and christian principles but eventually it has obvious it's become one of the most atheistic countries in the world man it's pretty hard to believe you know i mean uh that's i you know when i first got awakened by god and i i read our national anthem and i thought man my this is like such a christian song you know we just sung it all our lives and never even thought about it i honestly didn't think about it i sung it and i didn't believe in god or anything like that in my earlier days and yet you just sing it and i thought when you look back and you think man and all the the the structure and the churches and everything that was here and still here but that is far from that now and we know why i want to read from sorry you can't see this i'll just read it from here there are some that are bigger it just depended on how it pasted into the program so i want to talk about here in ephesians 6 18 so we're just going down a little bit from verse 12 and it says praying so i'm not going to cover the armor in this one but i'm going to the final in the seventh part of the armor which was praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me paul that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel and this is what i want to hit just for which i am an ambassador he says so he's representing something he knows who he is he knows his identity he's not representing the pharisees no more he's not representing the herodians or some political thing he's he's an ambassador of the gospel and we are ambassadors of the gospel and our nation is behind us hallelujah amen hallelujah and so prayer is our greatest weapon in destroying these powers because the i was going to call this breaking our national spirit which is the natural one breaking it and so there is going to be at the the way we're looking at this is to actually break these things out of our life to identify it to show the two spirits in our own lives and preach i want to i want to preach faith to identify and shun the kiwi nature in favor of our eagle dove national spirit i'll show you later on as you know the lord has lots of different ways of of displaying his nature but you can see you've got the dove and the eagle and then you've got the lamb and the lion and it's like the there's the heavenly creatures and it's the most meekest and the most majestic and then you've got the meekest burn and the most majestic bird so he covers it all and that's god and that's our national spirit so you can have an eagle and it's too it's going to be too much on one way or you can have a kiwi and oh my that just goes bad altogether but you have now with our national spirit if there was a flag there would be a an eagle and a darva and a lion and a lamb amen there will be these natural nature attributes that would declare what the spirit is about what is our culture about what do what defines us in our heavenly culture and paul was proud to say i'm an ambassador of that i'm an ambassador of heaven i'm an ambassador of a greater national spirit and i and and and and for me and i pray that tonight we will be able to identify traits that we are that the devil uses in our lives to bring us down and to hinder our walk and to hinder our communication to hinder our fellowship with each other with god with ourself with the people out there you know these these things and so i just pray tonight if something touches your house or comes to your mind and it's like yeah that's me don't worry i'm not preaching at you amen we're preaching for you amen we're together in this because it's coming my way too amen well none of us are exempt from this you know why because we ain't got a body change yet there ain't no body change here and you got raised by normal like natural people well i got raised by natural people and they got raised by natural people and there's cultures and there's spirits and there's all sorts of things amen oh my let's continue on hallelujah romans 12 1. well well paul says sorry before i go to romans 12 100 ephesians 6 20 because i only got to the first line but it says for which i am an ambassador in bonds that there and i may speak boldly as i ought to speak and now in romans 12 1 it says i beseech you i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice and i want to get into something a little later and that work sacrifice is a great thing and and when we realize what climate we're in right now man you'll be willing to sacrifice all of it that would hinder you and last night every weight and the sin that that's so easily beset you know hold you back oh my holding back blockages things that would just hinder from such an expression where god is you're irresistible you know there's no stinking coming up and and mindsets the way you think you know god thinks very differently than us his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and so if we employ our parental thoughts or thoughts that we got from school or thoughts that came from our work mates or place or even what we've thought of and seen by the eyes out there and cultures and politics we it's not that's that's very much repulsive to the spirit of god it's like not even like it it's just it's just hard to deal with amen even though but god's gracious you know he will he will send something your way to identify what that is and he will provide you deliverance he will provide a way of escape there's a way of escape tonight there's a way of escape from that old religious mindset there's a way of escape from message false culture there's a way of escape from the kiwi spirit a way of escape tonight amen it's not simple it's not complicated it just it's it's it's the blood of jesus his blood is so powerful his blood speaks better things than that of abel's it's speaking tonight saying you can be free actually it's saying more than that saying you are free because it was finished at calvary sin was dealt with sickness was dealt with mental illness was dealt with all ailments all false lies were dealt with everything was dealt with because he is the way the truth and the life and there is a way for you to come into connection with him and he's the deliverer actually he is the abolisher of all death and all of its things underneath it he removes it all he's done it it's not something that has to happen it is finished it's absolutely done and this is the mindset and you know we hear this all the time preachers every preacher that would preach under inspiration will tell you this right and you think oh my i've heard this but i like it but it's got to become reality the way we think and it defies logic and it will bring a reproach to you if you continue to think this way you'll be called extreme radical i mean we already get called radical anyway so you might as well just go go go up with the ship of zion go up with the ship we're not going down with the ship it ain't sinking this ship's going up amen get on board get on board amen it's landed brother branham it's landed sister meter it's landed my whole mother it's landed oh brother blue it's landed all these people it's landed sister val it's landlords you get on board that's going amen hallelujah amen romans 12 1 did we get there yeah we did romans 12 2 oh it's a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service if you realize the climate we're in we you know this was way later but i'll just lay it now as a foundation we're in a war and you know in the time of war everything changes nations change if the nation goes to war you kiss your business production goodbye it's going to be making weapons it's going to be making all sorts of things i don't know maybe it might not now because they just push buttons now but whatever it used to be the whole nation changed everybody sacrificed everything the economy stopped everything stopped now i don't want to get extreme until you stop working and don't do anything but just go out there and tell everyone but you know we have to be balanced but in your heart and in the way you think it has to be like that you have to get the mind of christ on every matter we're coming to a climate now and the devil's got his nukes out he's got his guns out he's got everything out he he he's just it's a relentless thing now it's all the stops are out now it's not time just to go about living how you've always lived it's a time for sacrifice amen you know it's very nice to go have a nice day at work or a hard day at work whatever it may be and then when you get home you don't want to do anything you want to sit on the couch and just veg out well i don't do that but i mean i used to do that i used to do that and i would drink beer you know i'm sure a lot of men out there do that they do nothing after work and when they watch the tv and it just pumps them full of the stuff but that's not the calling that's not a holy calling for us there is a high and holy calling and you know what that is lord i've got free time what would you like me to do i'm here you know if you've got a family be a family man do family altar you know do something like this god this time you know we're in a serious time and we have to make the most of these moments that we have and you know the best thing to do is just to say lord i'm available lord what do you want me to do tonight amen that's it be available to god and he'll speak to you he'll tell you oh well you put something upon your heart he'll send somebody and you might not want to have fellowship that night but god sent them and you've got to have it that you're sacrificing you know it's important it's very important that we are submitted to the lordship of god and we are saying lord not my will but thy will be done i i'm going to present myself a living sacrifice upon your altar now watch this watch what happens in romans 12 and you should read the whole chapter because see the chapter of romans 12 is saying this is how it starts and then you will begin to understand what the will of god is and then what happens next is all he begins to talk about the gifts and the operation of god and this is what we all want we want to see the supernatural who wants to see the supernatural who wants god to take over your life so much that all you see is god physically now not just you know like memories or or like well it's a good feeling but actual material miraculous reality the presence of god that we enjoy so much will materialize you know it goes beyond an awesome experience in church and maybe the odd nice time when he comes down in prayer but it becomes to materialize and that is that comes with sacrifice now i'm not saying to become like a religious pharisee and go and just fast every day and do it in your own strength but it's the attitude of the heart and it's how you approach your day it's how you approach your life are you on the altar are you a living sacrifice tonight you know you all know because you see we have ideas and we want to do things and we've got plans but are those plans surrendered to god they may be god's plans for you you might have caught the the the wavelength of what god wants you to do but you have to surrender that because god can tune it he can tune your life and until you really get to that point where you're willing to say lord not my dreams not my ambitions but yours it's hard for you to go any further with god you can have awesome times your knowledge will increase because you're sitting under ministry and you'll go to these conventions and camps and have glorious times but your life will stay the same because you're not willing to surrender yourself as a living sacrifice upon the altar i'll just read it again the bible says it very easily by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service hey man that's like it's just reasonable i don't know what's that that's just average i mean it will come forth but more will come that's the beginning is a reasonable thing come and let us reason together you know i've got a better plan for you than you got that's what that's basically what god will is inferring me i'm inferring you know god's got a better plan our plans might be nice and we've worked it all out and we've got all these things sussed out what we're going to do short term midterm and long term but actually god's got a better plan he knows you built you he built the heritage of your whole natural spiritual and he created your soul don't you think he knows a bit better he knows what to plea he made you so that whatever he calls you to do it's gonna fit better than a hand in the glove it's gonna fit so well and you'll be satisfied you'll feel fulfilled because you're right in the center of what he's made you for me oh my he made you that way hallelujah now the reason i'm saying this is because we need to escape out these national spirits and these national spirits uh i mean you know i don't want to like sound all doom and gloom but you know they're just they're just everywhere they're everywhere and they're going there they you so they can find your your weak points and then they'll use that as leverage against you and your and the people around you and they try everything and until you escape that and to get dominion over that and lay a sacrifice of your life on the altar you'll be affected by that in multiple ways and so therefore if you it's actually far easier long term to just surrender absolutely submit and say lord even the stuff i don't know what i need to submit i just give that to you too and lord if there's anything and you can pray that i pray that all the time lord if there's anything in my life that i'm holding on to that i've gripped by my own will oh god you know we we're so we need him that light you know and you know you might be having a hard week and you think what's going on are you praying just wait and then he reveals it to you and what seemed so small and didn't you might have passed it off as just not really you know not even uh worth thinking about became the very reason why you had the bad week and it might not be anything major just might be a certain thing that happened or didn't happen and god showed you you were meant to do that or you you had that attitude there you know obviously the more you get closer to god the more he becomes you become tuned in and the more he expects from you in the way that you conduct and carry yourself if you walk far from god you know you'll he'll deal with you in a different way he'll bring you back you're always he wants he wants intimacy but to get intimacy you've got to start somewhere you know you've got to start somewhere start with a complete surrender start with being willing to just lay it all down amen you know and it's not something we're not catholics here you don't have to get on your knees with some beads and crawl up the steps 400 steps not even seven steps just one step and that is here i am lord absolute surrender amen so that we can escape this national spirit so and not just escape it we're going to defeat it we're not running from nothing you're meeting the devil and you're toeing the line actually don't even get off your toes you know brother branham said this now you know a fighter they if you're fighting and you're trying to fight you never go on your heels that's just i mean there might be some moves but when you're boxing you're on your toes and if you go if you're off your toes you've lost your ability and agility and dexterity and and you're just slow now see like if i go they can push you over but if you're on your toes you're ready you know and brother branham said that we must be on our toes don't get off your toes be on red alert for the devil against the devil because that's this is an age and i tell you we're in war and in the time of war you'll be willing if you recognize the war you know you won't you it won't be a problem it won't be a problem because you begin to see sin as it really is romans 12 2 it says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen amen i want to read from romans 1 20 to 23. it's so funny ben preached on all of us and i wasn't even i didn't even know i was going to be preaching until monday i think or early in the week and i didn't know what and i was just praying and then i got to this and i started reading this about national spirits i was like man every scripture is basically what ben used on sunday and i thought man i better put a disclaimer there and i'm not like oh i better just take these scriptures oh my i mean we're all guilty of doing that sometimes because it blesses you so much you know you want to go man i could just i love that you know and you get an inspiration from a certain scripture but this was already here and this is where the lord led us so amen he's obviously just revisiting his own scriptures for us but this thing is here tonight we're not going to so much hit the um the reasons per se but we're going to hit something here and i just want to read it because i believe that it's very important for us to realize that though we may be filled with the holy ghost then we may know god who knows god can you say you know him amen i know god now that doesn't give you an exemption from what's about to be read you can still be lured into things and and and become identified with the wrong things and if you really you know the more you get identified with something the more you materialize it the more you become it and to the point where you know it says in in him we're not going to go too far into it but god will give gave the world over to different degradations of their mind and their mind became darker and darker and darker until they were so far from god that they became beasts that they became identified with animals dirty filthy animals a man and a woman that was made in the image of god now that's on a major lay a big level but we'll read it but it can happen on a smaller level on an individual level and actually what we read here is comprised of individuals it's not just we look at stuff and think oh it's a big general thing but actually they were real people that and watch this they i'll just read it so i want you to be careful what you represent what what are you an ambassador of when people see you at work what are you representing what's materializing in your life what's the actions how do you react and and what do you do hallelujah what ambassador are you what's behind you because you what you do with these members what you yield them to us to the servant whom you are and therefore an ambassador no wonder we get so caught up sometimes and confused and things because this hand is doing is serving of the devil in the sand serving god and it's just like oh this is where amnesia starts to break down and then the devil gets you real down because you get amnesia because you're the help between two opinions and your mind becomes unstable hallelujah but remember we heard there's a stabilizer amen hallelujah and i believe that we were greatly stabilized was it sunday we were greatly stabilized you see we we hear stuff you know what the word we're an entrance is ministered you know so when you hear preaching and something is like an opportunity you know it's an entrance and it's ministered and you can take that leap you can take that plunge it was it's mixed with faith and and you can go into that thing that was being preached and you then you can walk into it and then apply it and now you're ready to fight because you're going to fight you're going to stand toe and you're going to toe the line with the devil and you're going to come at you and you're going to give him a hiding you know you guys are just a bunch of devil beaters amen giving him a hiding hallelujah why and how through a holy sanctified consecrated life that's done by god's grace because you reacted to an opportunity that was ministered to you or god came down into your bible study or your prayer in the morning you gave them something to work with you know we're going to give something god something to work with you because of grace will will take you into that thing that you want that from god and you express that and then grace comes and it and it makes it reality therefore the actions and what happens what's materialized in your life you're an ambassador of the gospel and you've got heaven behind you if you've got heaven behind you and that devil comes crying at you and trying to tempt you you can just give him such a hiding amen i've said this so many times but when i first got saved the devil was always hounding me in my memories and the lord gave me a tool the lord showed me that i if i get attacked in my mind with mind battles and heaps of thought to pray for somebody or to text them i think what the texts were back in their old days they all buttons you know so i was like to try and get one word out [Music] man we did it hard you know at least it wasn't the old bone that went round like that but we did it pretty difficult back then oh my oh man so but it actually disarmed the devil because every time he got me and he was hounding me all of a sudden some out where else there was atomic bombs going off amen do you know you've got the button to let atomic bombs go spiritual atomic bombs when you get tempted if let's say you make a stand tonight and you stand against whatever's troubling you or some spiritual thing that's identified and you say no more and and the devil's telling you yes there's going to be more you say no and he and you walk out of there and he's hounding you and he's at you you just start praying for somebody you just start glorifying god this is war this is this is why you expect that it's going to happen you're going to get delivered and the devil's going to try and undeliver you he's not going to give up he just sieges and sieges you and you know who knows what a siege is it's like a city that's defending itself and it doesn't have it can't go out and fight because it's not big enough so it defends itself and the bigger army just waits there and starves them until they give up and die of starvation and then they just take it you know that's what the devil tries to do in our lives he tries to get you to give up and live with those things even though you don't like them and they just stay there like tributaries in the land and they pay you tribute they're in there and they're just constantly there and you just think well i'll just take a you know i'll just i'll i'll just live with that and it might be something that comes at you all the time and you just live with it and it might be a sickness it might be something and it's a devil don't ever think oh i've dropped this and it's from my family or it's this and that's the devil the devil is responsible for it and jesus is responsible for removing it and he removed it it's dealt with and so if you're getting attacked by something and it comes back at you and it keeps coming back and you just go to the you just take you cloud it out with painkillers or or you go to some psychiatrist or whatever and and you just think you know what it's easier just to do that isn't it well actually i'll tell you what long term is not long term it's not going to get anywhere it's going to stay the same or degrade but you have a fight in you and i just pray that you will never give up that wherever it comes you just say no that's it i'm praying it might sound silly i've prayed it over and over but this time this time deliverance is sure this time i'm taking all amen i shall have all this my inheritance perfect health is my inheritance who believes that jesus dealt with sin did you know when he dealt with sin he dealt with all of his attributes it's all finished it's all done therefore if you get sick it's just a lie actually really it's symptoms you see the symptoms and you see what's going on but actually really the devil is lying he doesn't have a right to keep you there and if he does it means you need to repent of something because you've got some sin going on or something's happening and or or there's an unbelief or there's a cloud or there's a blockage or you're going through a job you need to discern your your body you know discern the lord's body you know that's your body is the lord's body right it's not just your body it's the lord's you need to discern that what's going on in there lord what's happening to me why am i going through this lord show me jesus show me why i am having this he will show you he will show you but i tell you now you don't have to live and i and i just encourage you and if anyone's on that tape out there i encourage you don't ever let the siege bring you down to weaken you to the point where you've ascribed yourself to live with whatever the devil's handing you actually i was something came and i'll read it which is about that this is what i was just i just yeah never ever ever give up fighting even if the siege has gone on so long and the enemy thinks he's got you and you've begun to compromise and that you'll live with it what the devil is handing you don't do it you're a son or daughter of god you are free and there is a resounding jubilee for you it's constant the jubilee sounded and the one that gave and gives is the jubilee is here amen to abolish everything until death itself is abolished you know that he's come to wrap it all up he's just come to finish it all hallelujah it's all gonna it's all getting finished every devil every member every enemy everything all he's leaving no stone unturned amen all those stones that you know we're like living stones and they might be buried in muck you might find yourself covered in moss the effects of your past and the enemy says can that live and i say yes and god says yes you might find yourself slimed over or beaten or broken but it shall be part of the temple it shall be part of god's glorious crown you've you he's not finished amen that was way at the end but i just read it there because it came up so i'm not being very behaved of these slides ah be careful what you represent and sow into because you can take on wrong spirits you know we can take on human spirits and that's how you take on national spirits you take on human spirits and the devil's very crafty on how he does it and if you get so entangled upon the affairs of this life and you get caught up in all these theories and politics and all of that you are on dangerous ground for becoming you know what's the opposite of benefactor but you are becoming part of that and that's starting to affect your life and influence you negatively even like this this government you know and i'm thankful for our country naturally speaking because it's not a hard country to live in but the way that they're operating now when it comes to they're just handing money out do you know that makes people that's just it actually weakens people's resolve because they begin to buy into this like this is actually not that hard you know i begin to go oh i could do some with some more of that so you begin to apply and you get more money given to you and maybe you can sit around and not do anything it's actually an act of war and it actually works on the it works on the maternal and paternal instinct of of your mind until you can feel like that's like a parent to you and it's if you're not careful you can actually the government can become your parent you know that you become like like you become dependent but we shouldn't be dependent on the man's government we should we should respect the government respect the government give caesar what caesars but don't let that become your mama don't let auntie cindy be your mom amen hallelujah oh my or your dad amen whatever don't let that happen you know god is our father we are a royal seat of abraham amen actually you know what we own this place this is all our house amen co-ed is with christ this is who you are you're an ambassador of the land that you really own they think they own it and they've got temporary they've got like a temporary deed but really the title deed you've got that straight from the hands of the creator oh my did he come down to you who came down to you who what did he hand you i like having a bible down in here this looks like this looks like a man's bible sorry a man why did he come down what did he give you oh my he gave you the word and he gave you the ownership he said i'm going to be coheir with you i'm coheir with you and i'm coming down you you know this this is a picture i love so much we read in revelation 10 and we talk about revelation 10 7 which was brother branham's message and he faithfully sounded the mysteries and everything god done through him but the personal touch upon the whole thing john who you are typed with was called to take that from the hand of god himself not from brother branham we're not following a man and worshipping a man we're not called to take this book out of brother branham's hand if we do we'll just become branhamites but i don't believe i'm speaking to brandomites tonight i believe i'm speaking to mrs jesus christ who's been called to take it from his hand a personal touch personally hand it to you marian john ben all of you he invites you he says come and take it and eat it become one with it let this be an ambassador amen represent this and be patriotic about it hallelujah amen come to such a place where you recognize who you are and when you come into a place you know god is in that place god is in that place and i'm not talking about this flesh i'm talking about christ in you and and really he's going to redeem you it's still going to look similar maybe there won't be so many rolls or wrinkles but [Music] but you will look similar and that's you and you're part of him you're his family amen and so it's time to expose the devil and then when he's exposed and you can see how he's infiltrated you can see it you can just say no no that's not me and i'm going to lay those things aside i'm going to lay my life down because this is actually a war and we're in a war and when a war you just don't sit back hey man now you can i like my sofa i can have a good relax you know i'm good at relaxing and you need that but i'm not saying but i'm meaning your life if you look at your life and you sing think back over the last six months of your life if it's just predominantly couch and work and there's been no real action well you should reassess your life you should really there should be hallmarks of god's glory amen and i tell you it's not it's not some complex thing it just means surrender this is this is why i read romans 12 1 2 lay your life on the altar so that he can renew your mind so you can begin to think the way he thinks that he's first in your thinking and he by his grace and his mercy begins to renew your mind and then if you continue reading romans 12 12 it begins to talk about the life expressed it talks about there's inspiration of the supernatural then it talks about the natural but yet supernatural life of a christian and that nature that love that dove and lying lamb and eagle manifesting in you to what does it do it continues to take you from glory to glory but if you hear the word and you enjoy it but you don't act upon it and there's no real action that just puts you in a stalemate there has to be an application and the application is god will place on your mind put that on my altar are you willing who's willing you know just to lay it all so you can have his glory and have his love and have his grace hallelujah i remember being first saved man i was so zealous to give everything over i just so wanted to surrender all and i did am i i mean you know you only surrender what you notice surrender as you go on and he begins to take you through the processes you begin to realize wow you know i'm still on a journey and you kind of on the journey as he unfolds it to you and he begins to show and he puts his hand upon things and puts his finger on things and he begins to change everything about you till you reflect him till you you know you go through trials you go through hardships and you come to a point you know and you there's a hot there's milestones and you walk with god milestones and things happen and and you might think oh it's just a small thing but to god it's a big thing heaven's rejoicing oh no you know that we're part of a family that's waiting for us and they're not complete without us and they're gunning it and they're saying come on let's do this on your toes bride of shekinah tabernacle on your toes don't give up hallelujah it might seem look impossible in the mountains all around you but don't give up just keep fighting just keep fighting just take that sword and cut that devil feel like you're repeating yourself just cut him in again just keep cutting just keep cutting don't give up because the devil you're going to be when he's all gone you're still going to be there you know that when he's all finished you have endured because christ in you hallelujah amen i didn't even read romans 1 20. romans 1 20 says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power in godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god now that's what i've underlined because this is the key to this one at the angle that i'm taking when they knew god so these people knew god they knew him my you know this changes the whole thing they knew god and we know god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened this is a serious thing saints and if you le if you just get back on your heels and sit back and let the devil run amok in your mind and you just begin to entertain yourself with the devil and with his things you watch and it may be just small things it may it's just feeding the wrong thing what happens is you begin to go down the wrong path and it begins to separate you even though you know god this was a door for the world and these people that knew god it took them out it was a gateway out of god's economy a gateway from a glorious experience and there is a gateway open that's a path that leads to destruction and it's wide and it's hungry and hell is enlarging itself to try and take people and try and woo them out but tonight i encourage you don't ever give up on fighting against that however you might fail and fail and fail but just never give up get back up and toe the line total i say not this today right now is my deliverance right now is my healing right now is my baptism of the holy ghost right now i'm going to cross over jordan hallelujah amen but because you see this world here if you continue reading says when they knew not god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations their foolish heart was dark and professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made up like corruptable man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things and so you see they begin to worship those things then you watch if you continue reading which we're not going to do tonight but that they physically became identified with the things that they worshipped and they became beasts and they corrupted the man's mind and corrupted down degraded until they were identified as beasts and you know god is not afraid to teach kings like nebuchadnezzar who was proud and he began to lift himself up you know what happened god gave him a mind of a beast and he was for however many years seven years he was an animal in the field so you can see now that's an extreme example but what i'm trying to get to here is that you can get caught up in a national spirit and you can become to take on the attributes of that animal that beast that bird and i want to tell you now the national spirit of new zealand is a kiwi and if you get caught up under the dominion of that domain which you're not meant to because you're above it it's under your feet you know that the national spirit of new zealand is under your feet completely defeated but you can begin to ascribe and you can begin to believe those things and get caught up in the politics of it and you can and actually in your flesh will beget actually has traits of it already and you need to overcome those things by the grace of god overcome these traits hallelujah 2 corinthians 11 3 it says here but i fear paul says by but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled ethereustility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which we have not received or another gospel which we have not accepted you might well bear with him you see we're not exempt from receiving other spirits or connecting with other people you see you have to discern the lord's body you've got to discern what's going on in your life you need to discern actually there was a tongues and interpretation in one of the meetings i think it was allowed to see in church age and a man stood up and he prophesied in that meeting and he said take guard of your heart and i thought wow that's a really gripping statement take guard of your heart don't let these narratives and don't let these spirits discern it and you think why do i do this why is this thing keep surfacing in my life where does it come from and you can trace it back it's not of god well then where does it come from it's from an identity of the natural it's an unnatural identity and it's something to discern and it's something to get dominion over it's something to get deliverance from it's something to say you know i'm not letting that thing rule over me amen i'm not going to let the devil do those things in my life i'm not going to be identified with that because i am an ambassador of god's glory i'm an ambassador of heaven and i represent hallelujah the people of the book i represent an open book i represent an inheritance of love and grace hallelujah i don't come into a room and it escalates into something it de-escalates amen it's an atmosphere hallelujah our national spirit naturally speaking here we are we're here we've arrived at what it is and there's probably more things but these are the things that popped out to me this is the kiwi spirit tall poppy i thought that was that's the main that's the worst one oh my tall puppy okay it's for you for those of you that it's fresh in new zealand this might be a really good um session for you but you tall puppy it's not it's a spirit that's in new zealand that's non-supportive of others who are rising up in favor or are different that have something that is um prodigy you know like something that's that's in somebody god's gifted something or and it's a great thing it in the natural now a natural new zealand person that would that they it's everyone gets skeptical and there's skepticism and there's like all this you know like a narrative against it and and and there's accusations of pride and all of these different things that's the tall poppy the next one is she'll be right and this is a real man i mean we're we're getting somewhere you know we're getting somewhere she'll be right this is unkempt relationships and situations and leaving things to fester and just it's just carelessness right this is these are traits now i'm just going to read them out i'm not going to go too far into them uh the next one false modesty and humility due to tall poppy pressure so there is a pressure for new zealanders to not do anything special and if they do they they don't want to do it and there's a lot of gifted people whether in church or out of church whatever that don't express their gifts because they don't want to come across as being proud or being better than anyone else and it's not about being better than anyone else but people should be true to the grace that's given them and i'll get to it rivalry revelry vile i mean this is a huge one in new zealand revelry the the spirit of revelry who knows what the spirit of revelry you know what is revelry rivalry is just drunkenness and celebration of just nothing crazy and i was part of that a long time ago and many many like a life ago and and then the huge spirit of sport in new zealand but revelry vile sport fanaticism and you know what as i was writing this this came it is due to a suppression of religious joy did you know that the reason that there's so much degradation in society is the failure of the church it's the failure of those that should have been preaching an entrance all these thousands of years and ministry went into a nicolaitan spirit and the human beings went away from it they couldn't get it they lost contact and so now hello people who can bring joy back amen ministry that can minister an entrance and you can go higher and further and deeper we have it we're under a fountain of god's river of pleasure you know that he's got a river of pleasure for you amen he's got a river of pleasure for you brother paul amen hallelujah and and and you know this is why it says because of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold and the iniquity is can only happen in the church because they're the ones that knew they were doing it and it pushes the spirit of god away they begin to do things of their own will they were not willing to lay a sacrifice on the altar so that god's will could manifest but here we are restored god's will is being manifested tonight god's will is being manifested here under this vision that god began amen and we are beneficiaries of an outlet amen you know that there's an outlet here in wellington god has got an outlet hallelujah he's got an oasis amen an oasis where he can bring people joy bring people deliverance bring people peace bring people a relationship bring people a rapture amen bring people a family amen that can be closer than your natural family you know that our spiritual family can be closer than our natural family and we want our natural family to be our spiritual family too right and some of you are blessed with that but i i can tell you now that spiritual family if your family is not spiritual family but your spiritual family is very close compared because of common ground we all believe the same thing and we've got this vision together you know we're of one mind anyway i'll carry on we'll never get through it emotional suppress oh sorry rivery via sport fanaticism due to suppression of religious joy formalism as a flightless bird oh mate emotional suppressiveness that's too you know these are some of the words that will be used that's too deep men don't cry stoic just suppressing emotion you know too ashamed to express emotion and they wonder why there's so much suicide in new zealand that's why because then people aren't able to express their emotion for shame for feeling embarrassed about it break it if you are an emotional suppressant and you struggle with it just ask god tonight to heal you to heal you so that you can really express emotion that's very important for your mental health so important stock unable to communicate these are traits of in new zealand unable to communicate unable to talk and have a good heart-to-heart conversation without getting upset you know i have them with people and you want to talk real deep stuff you know like i mean when i say deep i don't mean doctrinally deep i mean like rudimentary social stuff that's like real weighty and people get upset man they fire up it's so interesting you know like when we've had lots of brothers and sisters that have come here to new zealand from well africa as well particularly and because a lot of africans have come here and they can't understand how new zealanders are so closed in emotions and closed and not conversation and just not accountable to each other but when you go over to these other places everyone knows everything about everybody and it's easy to connect and if you if you are talking like this is a big one you can have a conversation with somebody and they're happy as and really they're thinking completely opposite now that's new zealand they're thinking i can't wait for this conversation to end i want this guy out of my house and that's what they're thinking but they're just happy as and they're just answering and asking you questions come on have you do you know that this is the new this is a typical this is extremely typical but it's typical and it happens and this is this is the new zealand they and it's an i think it comes from the english this is an english thing it's very everything's done by hints everything's done subtly and subtle hints no one just says what it is they're just like come on just tell me let's just be real and i pray that us as a as a church family we can just be real and we're not ashamed of who we really are don't put your hand up i'm gonna warn you but is anyone ashamed of who they are you know no one don't be ashamed of who you are because you see we're all a work in progress god begun something in you god started something in you philippians 1 6. if anyone wants to read that write that down and you can read that later that's a promise to you of philippians 1 6 and i want you to read that but i want you to think about something god did for you it doesn't matter how small he started something amen and that means he's going to finish it he's faithful who believes god's faithful tonight oh isn't he faithful i want to sing that song you know you are faithful every day every hour oh my he's so faithful to me oh my the last one here now now please i know there's probably so many more but we don't have all night so self-reliance is a huge one in the kiwi culture where we rely on our own ability we rely on our ingenuity and we're known around the world for ingenious like creations and ideas and just this whole drive because such a small country it's like the small country syndrome you know but yet within there there is god you know he's created this country and it's the uttermost part of the earth and it's the first country to see the sun based on the time system that that's been created and so you can see there it is a special place but we should never rely on ourself we should never think i've got to do this i've got this you ain't got it i ain't got it oh my he's got it you know he's got it not you we ain't got it and the moment we can just surrender that do you know when you really believe that it's when you lay your life a living sacrifice on the altar because you realize i haven't got this and and that's where that you begin to find the will of god for your life right there key there's a key there the attributes of a kiwi bird oh my yeah man you know i'm not much of a you know like there are brothers that will research and they'll get you all the deepest things and lots of it when it comes to the stuff but i just found one article and it was enough [Laughter] oh my i mustn't be the most i love studying the bible but when it comes to studying that stuff out there oh my makes me tired tiny wings so they've got tiny little wings i'm not going to be identified with that okay they freeze when they're distressed if i get distressed i'm going to run towards the enemy if the enemy challenges you don't run back you know what you do you run forward because guess who's going to step in for you you might not even know what's going to happen but it's going to be good for you and it's going to be bad for you for the devil the enemy going down because you're running towards him and who's in you amen oh my who's in you so when you when you might and you might get something happen to your good tonight because you gave had faith and you said i'm gonna take that and then you get out there and the devil's waiting to toe the line but you're on your toes and when he comes at you you run towards him and you give him the biggest hiding he's ever got oh yeah oh my hallelujah feathers malt oh yeah so they're always losing you know a deciduous tree we're not called to be deciduous who knows what deciduous means is that still taught or is that an old word i'm fairly old it's a tree that loses its leaves hey we don't want to be a seasonal tree amen do you know if you're planted by the river of life you're always green always fruitful amen there's seed in you real life and people eat this the fruit amen it says you're a wholesome part of god part of his word the proverb says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life he says i am the vine you are the branches therefore you you bear fruit for him because you're planted because you've got an em you realize i'm an ambassador like paul i'm an ambassador for heaven i'm an ambassador of christ i ain't representing no flightless bird that gets distressed and freezes and gets petrified oh the enemy and you're sitting in church you know what you know no one's gonna say oh that certainly is bad when they hear you cast out the devil in church i've had to cast out the devil many times because he's coming at me in church he comes at you in church because he thinks oh they can't say anything so i'm gonna just get them and it ruins the atmosphere around you and then the next person can go man i feel negative what's going on that person brought a battle to church but you see now you can go you know i heard something tonight and and the enemy might be hounding me in my pew but i'm gonna just stand i'm gonna say devil i bind you i claim this you know this is my this is god's temple and he might be hounding at you in god's temple that's not that's not his it might be fallen it might be but god's willing to be inside that you know that we think of our flesh as something so far gone and it's uh but really god is willing to go in there you know that he's willing to live in that he's willing to wash dishes with you he's willing to stand with you he's willing to go to school with you he's willing to go through it all with you in you therefore i think he's jealous over that body because it's his temple that's his he's jealous you know we think he's kind of forsaken the body but actually he he actually lives inside it therefore he's looking he wants you to look after it and be a faithful steward of it amen hallelujah so i'm not going to be identified with that so i just i read these things and you think you know what if i feel if there's anything that's been said now that i'm like and you think oh my and i've oh my on these things because we are we have to be honest and if you're honest you can get deliverance or you have honest you can let's not say it might not be like in need of some sort of like demonic deliverance but like i'm talking about uh just it's just the fact that it gets exposed and it's just a habit or something you learned from your parents or something that you that you and that was in your inherent uh genes and it's like oh i've i realize no that's that then tonight don't walk out with it you see this is where the mind needs to change deliverance is not some time lock thing it's not something you have to grovel to god about and it can happen right now if you see it and god says you know what it's time it's time for you to just walk in their liberty because now you realize oh wow that yep i i've done that or that's happening to me i need to walk out of this and tonight don't just walk out of the church walk out of that dysfunctional habitual whatever it may be males incubate eggs instead of the mother so you see now in kiwis it's turned around so there's this whole confusion now you could say if you're going to attribute yourself to a kiwi bird the males incubate the eggs instead of the mother you know but it's it's usual in the as a son of god that we don't do the mother maternal instinct you know there's a divide there is a clear balanced definition between a mother a male and a female and god loves definition and so we don't want to be caught up in a confusion of male and female definition now we don't want to take that to the extreme and go you know what i'm a man i ain't never going to wash no dishes i ain't never going to cook no eggs you know i don't think that that's what it means and i think that people that do that take it to the extreme we should be part of this as a co-equal team you know we we we do our children together we do these things together but there are times and places where we need to know that clear demarcation between a male and a female and and realize you're positioned sons of god and realize you're positioned daughters of god because you are built for that and there's an anointing to be released upon your life to fulfill that in its glory it's an anointing you know like every office that god calls a human being to his anointing come for it to power empower that so that it can happen right and we just need to tap into that nocturnal creatures of the night poor eyesight now who's going to choose poor eyesight over eagle vision i ain't going to choose no poor eyesight i'm not going to be identified with no kiwi bird who's going to be identified with kiba in no way who wants to be identified with an eagle bird amen the higher you fly amen the more you see amen because you've been raised up on eagle's wings amen god sent you a prophetic message to raise you up on eagle's wings to take you to himself amen you know he said that to israel he said to moses and he says i've taken you on eagle's wings and brought you to myself and i'm going to put you in a wilderness experience and to take you into the land amen and that's what god is doing for us he take us out of egypt on eagle's wings to himself take you through the wilderness willing to walk with you willing to to call you a brethren willing to say you're my bride god who's willing that to say i love you i care for you i care for your body i care for your spirit and i care for your soul not just your soul it's not neglect all three parts because each part has a part to play you need to be balanced in all areas of your life if your your soul gets redeemed but if you neglect the other two you're going to have a your experience is going to be dampened you know brother branham said you can be holy ghost filled and have a mental illness and be deranged in your mind you can get to such a point and that's why i'm speaking these things because what you ascribe to what you begin to take your affections onto what you begin to become patriotic for you know to be patriotic for something it means it's stolen your affections it's stolen your your concern it's it's taken a portion of your worship your attention because you're patriotic for it you're standing for it you've got like this drive to support that but really who's behind it because if it ain't heaven it's the devil might look like some good movement but really what is it where does it come from so we have to be careful and when you begin to ascribe to that what does it do it begins to confuse you bring you down and you wonder why your experience is the way it is is because of what you are attributing yourself to likely to lose its children that was a big one for me and i when i read this i thought wow did you know the success rate of a new birth in kiwis is five percent i'm gonna say a new birth because if you raise your children as a kiwi you're going to lose them and they're going to go into the world because there's no that kiwi spirit is designed to destroy families to separate fathers and sons to separate mothers and daughters to break it and to cause prostitution and to cause drugs and to bring people into revelry to bring people into an emotional emotionless stoic flightless situation but i'm gonna tell you that's not our representation hallelujah amen hallelujah it's wartime saints and i've already touched on this so we're just going to fly through this one the climate and i want you to recognize the climate we're in is not just a time of peace out here the only peace is in here you've got perfect peace because your mind has stayed on him and he will keep you stable he will keep you steadfast unmovable when your life is on the rock and you see that's why it's so important for you to say you know what lord i give up i'm giving it all to you so that you can lead me in this troublesome time of war because there's no one else that can navigate this war outside of our jesus let me tell you about my jesus oh he's so good he knows the battle he's the five star general we're not no five star general hallelujah no minister no matter how great their message ministry may be or whatever there's no five star general only one and now prophet introduced us to him amen and when the work was done the prophet was taken and the firestar general just continued on hallelujah is continuing on he visited wellington hello you are beneficiaries of the general's visitation hello rahabbs who came out of prostitution came out of spiritual wickedness the captain came and found you he came and bowled down your walls so that you could be free so that you could come to marriage amen he saw you and he was willing to walk with you and out of egypt through the wilderness cross the jordan till you could come out of it all so you could come into connection and now he's still willing to walk with you all the way through to take you but you have to be willing to recognize that this is ain't no time of peace on earth there is only a sword and it's time to get on your toes saints don't give up don't live with that thing that's troubling you don't live with that headache and i'm talking minor things now don't live with that little thing that happens to you don't live with that little ailment in your shoulder or that ailment in your knees or whatever it may be you don't have to live with it you know we if we just live with everything that's easy that can be lived with when it comes to something major are you going to turn to god for that where is the lion do you just turn to god for the major things or do you trust god for everything amen hallelujah and god may lead you to the arm of medicine for healing but let him lead you whatever you do do it in faith don't do it in fanaticism or some like whim do it in faith and when you know the mind of god and when you're fully surrendered and he begins to share the mystery of his will you know that is what it is it's a love relationship to know the will of god is an abiding presence for you abide in him and his words abide in you oh my lord help me you know i'm just getting it to myself too that that is that's such an important thing no matter how busy you are don't never ever put god before or after whatever responsibilities you have whatever you have always let him be the first the worshiped one the the one that's exalted so highly in your life treat him properly hallelujah amen he ain't no errand boy hallelujah you know that he's not no errand boy hello but he will help you and he will do things for you because he loves you as a husband hallelujah oh man that makes me feel so good that we can find peace because when you begin to put stay your mind on him oh it just gives you peace to know that the one that's protecting me the one that's delivering me the one that's giving my family to me the one that's promised all these things i'm gonna plead those promises and i'm never gonna give up and when the enemy comes at me i'm gonna run towards him and i'm gonna fire the stones of faith and lord i'm running and that enemy's gonna go down and you can speak the outcome hallelujah speak it don't be afraid to speak it if you're afraid to speak it you're thinking wrong this is where faith is and you if we go back into the revivals of the um of the 50s and 60s these faith ministries they just said this is what's going to happen and people believed it and it happened they just said it just touch this and you're going to be healed and millions of people got healed because they just no there was no doubt in that there was no question and that's what faith really is it doesn't question it is because god said it is you're healed because god said you're healed by his stripes you were healed there is no wriggle room do you know that there's no wriggle room you who's under the atonement is all healed and brother branham you know he says if we could just get that sorted there'll be not a feeble person in this room there will be not an ailment in this room and there'll be nobody that wants to get the holy ghost that won't get it right now it's how we think let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus sorry i am going way over time i'm gonna read now okay we're just gonna finish in a sunday school type because i have to read it so please can i have five more minutes is that all right amen praise the lord i want you to think real spiritual now hallelujah i want the preaching to happen in your heart as i read okay we're not gonna go into anything too far so wartime do you realize the sacrifice of war we've touched on this sacrificing the old man to receive a renewed mind so that the new man can live look at the process of romans 12. go read it and look at the process it starts with the sacrifice it starts recognizing your day and its message it starts with recognizing the climate and saying i'm willing to take that altar that's been restored and i'm willing to lay my life down so that i can hear the voice of god and receive the mystery of his will for my life and then begin to live out a supernatural testimony we i you all put your hand up you want the supernatural so therefore say lord is there anything hindering it is there anything in my life that i'm not laying down because i don't want that i want to be fully in tune with you i want to have a renewal of my mind so that you can supernaturally operate through my life and i will when i see it happening a month i'm going to celebrate when god moves in my brothers and sisters i ain't going to be no tall poppy and go oh god's moving in there oh i wonder if that's the flesh oh you know that really destroys the atmosphere if god is using somebody uh this was later and we never got to it but i'll get to it now sorry i said i wasn't going to do this but it's just coming so if god starts to move in somebody and maybe you see and we're going to see it right because we've got children growing up and god's going to use them and he may use them in a greater measure than he uses us and we're going to celebrate it we're going to say amen i mean i love this i see that person came from sin and now they're greater than me hallelujah this is the attitude and we want to celebrate that we want to celebrate our young people god's grace is greater in them than it is in us some awesome gift manifested so i encourage you when we see it and we are seeing it and when we continue to see it make sure you celebrate it because god he it's he's saying to the church i'm giving you this this is me i'm gonna put my gift in this young boy this young girl and i'm gonna get glory and those in my church they love it you know what you celebrate that he'll give you more you know that you celebrate the one little gift or another he'll give you more you celebrate the supernatural operating there and there's no resentment or no funny stuff and you say oh praise god oh and you walk in that then he'll give more and he'll give it to you hallelujah if there's resentment the altar is open hallelujah we got it because there the altar is open for you to get healed of some national spirit called kiwi to poppy oh my lord jesus hallelujah this is just man we just because you know brother branstad a gift will not make itself known where it's not wanted you know that hallelujah and when a gift when the supernatural begins to operate do not think for a second the devil's going to try and stop her he goes for everything he knows what's going on in people's minds and he if the people begin to think oh i wonder if that's god or or that person's just thinking this and they're that and all this don't do that don't do it just cast that devil aside he doesn't want it to happen whenever you get a negative thought against anyone or anything like that it's not god it's the devil it's not you you're just a thought uh processor you ain't a thought generator you know that we don't generate thoughts in our own there's always a foundation for them they always come from an influence they come from a spirit they come from either god or satan hallelujah so you just have to be careful what you entertain and if it comes to your mind and you think oh that's negative you cast it out and then the holy spirit continues to flow the service goes up higher you know when god begins to move and the spirit begins to flow the devil's going to try everything to stop it and he's going to start firing negative thoughts in your mind or you just cast it aside throw up your hands and enter in you might feel nothing but enter in anyway because you can rejoice that that one is entering you can rejoice that that person is getting blessed get blessed for them and then you'll find that the spirit of god will come on you and you'll get blessed it's like a chain reaction amen don't just think there and this is the last thing you want to think everyone's getting blessed but not me oh the door doesn't like me that's just a devil you don't have to think that you just go you know what i don't feel very good right now but everyone else is feeling good so praise the lord amen and then someone begins to just go right off and through the roof amen you just rejoice hallelujah and things might happen that we don't understand you know because we haven't seen it before but just rejoicing god because the spirit of god amen you'll discern it perfectly working order hallelujah if so so the sacrifice ephesians 4 29 if so be that you have heard him and has been taught by him as the truthers in jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man the kiwi put off the kiwi which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind this is reflecting romans 12 1 and 2. the same thing let's put it off put it on the altar a living sacrifice amen which is a corrupt that just get rid of that let the fire come and consume that so that you can be renewed in the spirit of your mind so that these things god's grace begins to operate and begins to change your thinking and all of a sudden you're thinking kingdom thoughts you're thinking the way the king thinks because the king's got dominion in your mind because he's now able to live in and through you not you and him as a coalition there's no coalition we don't have a coalition with god it has to be god no coalition amen no winston peters calling the shots hindering the government oh my amen do you know that's what it really is if you're trying to rule in the coalition of god it's like winston peters you know he's in there and he's just causing his little spanner in the works god can't work with that he'll just work with you until you get to a point where he can take over amen hallelujah i don't mean to compare you to winston peters that's just a a crude example of what it must feel like to the lord when we're trying to do some of the ruling in our own life and we're not at that full state of surrender so that then it says it and that then here's the kind of icing for it and that you put on the new man which is after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so here is now the heavens national spirit so tall puppy is changed to all poppy amen we're all going up hey man we're all going in a rapture so it's not just one but if one starts growing and having a good time we just rejoice with them amen because we're coming too amen somehow we're going to be there too amen by his grace hallelujah we celebrate one another's exaltation regardless of the grace they get we don't compare ourselves with them because we're also under god's grace to come to where he wants us to be to exalt us under his mighty hand when we fully humble ourselves under his mighty hand he will exalt we are all exalted after death to self we shall glory in the exaltation of others if there is a problem there is still a death to take place in our own lives hallelujah then the next one that we want to do the opposite now i'm saying these things these are the opposite of the kiwi because you see sometimes habits are not demons they're just habits that you've done all your life or you've learned and you've just got to do the opposite they came to brother branham and they said brother branham i'm selfish and i just been prayed for every minister in the world i've had two buckets of oil on me in total and i'm still selfish what's wrong with me is it a devil and brother brown says no just do the opposite go and be unselfish go and make a point to go and do unselfish things go and give all your money to the poor go and do something that's going to completely change your mentality because it's just a bad habit that may be rooted deeply in your genetics and it needs you to take dominion over your own old nature and go and change it yourself that's the beauty of works so yes you're doing works and it's not but to earn anything but it helps you because it begins to train the old nature to realize that it's actually a benefit to you to be a glorious holy selfless person hallelujah so anyway opposites she'll be right becomes deep trust so instead of she'll be right neglecting things and and just keeping to yourself and keeping your own family never telling anyone anything about your problems and and and thinking and this whole she'll be right kiwi spirit now becomes this she'll be right it meant spirit becomes a deep trust in the local body no longer do we need to sweep our problems and private struggles under the rug no more false proclamation in place of transparency and trusting which is the biblical approach to bearing one another's burdens and detailing dealing with faults in each other's lives and love including our children and siblings amen so your children are not exempt you got to deal with each other and help each other and be transparent you see now it's not a case where we just go and sweep just ignore it we don't just want to ignore it it's got to be dealt with and when god puts his finger on something don't just ignore it don't just go you know what that's embarrassing this body is full of love this this family's full of love we can help you we can pray with each other we don't need to be ashamed of who we really struggle things that we struggle don't just just just have a deep trust that god has placed you in a family that loves you and cares for you amen false humility becomes meekness and trust in god amen discerning whose spirit we are taking on and projecting and this is my quote that i was going to read for the service it says and now many times we in churches this may seem strange but if you'll just watch it now this is for the church is for the people the people get one another spirit in the state of getting the holy spirit you go into a group of people you watch the way that person acts and then find people that come into that congregation the first thing you know they act the same way you you take a good woman and a bad man and he'll either he'll either become a good man or her a bad woman and the atmosphere that you live in you project to your associates is what you are then what type of people ought we to be if we're a christian what type of an atmosphere should we live in in this is the atmosphere now he says in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer with a deep love for every person we come in contact with lord help me lord help me make me like that lord because that is the spirit of christ hallelujah oh lord when i read that i thought my of lord here i am oh god i need your grace hallelujah amen our earthly culture received its boost in revelation 9 and all of the evil that came up out of hell then kiwi culture was flourishing and it's flourished under that devil anointing but our heavenly spirit national spirit was bolstered with the mighty angel coming down with the open book so you have now in your own life a meeting place of two powers and there's one power to bolster up the old nature and make that give it everything it wants layered to see and everything but then what you actually have to realize is and the the greatest visitation of god's presence has come to the earth personally to you to get your deliverance from it to get you changed from it to give you a way of escape in the time of trouble to take you and enrapture you and give you dominion completely and utterly totally delivered over all of revelation 9 and over all the kiwi spirits and over all those things god has come in a deep in an amazing way like never before and the reason is you're going to rapture the reason is is to take you to such a deliverance that not even death can touch you this is the difference this is the hope of our the message that we have it's not just a bunch of doctrines it's not just a bunch of correct teaching it's not just god's into prophet it's actually a prophet introduced god and he's come in fullness he's come now and not just with a closed book or just a partial revelation of of of of a grace of that will take the church in a certain thing it's to give everything it's to say here it is i'm handing back everything adam lost and i want you to grab hold of this i want you to put it on and i want you to walk with me and i'm going to train you i'm going to teach you i'm going to guide you amen let's have the musicians hallelujah amen so you can say you know what lord i may not understand everything that brother andy is telling me right now and and none of us can and brother brown said even he says i can't even grasp what it really is and what it really means i can't as a human in my mind even you know like to grasp the magnificence the magnitude of who's here of who has come and who you've been introduced to to take us and to deliver us can we sing that song every day and every hour you are faithful i'm going to need brother paul to lead from the congregation on this one because my rhythm and as the music plays i want to read this scripture here [Music] john 14 20. who are you really and i want to read what he says about you at that day you shall know and i'm talking about this day that i am in my father so jesus saying i'm in my father but wait i want you to make it personal children watch where jesus says you are he's jesus says i'm in my father and you're in me so you're in the father and you're in jesus and then watch this it gets more personal and he says and i'm in you so he's in the father you're in him and he's in you so that makes you part of god amen who are you are you a kiwi or are you an eagle are you a god man a god family man a family woman of god part of the commonwealth of god amen a queen hallelujah hallelujah part of this heritage oh my look not every man to his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who thought who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god hallelujah you're in him he's in you and the prophet says this look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you [Music] sorry christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ and christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing [Music] this is this is a hold on this stand [Music] this is just too much for the human mind christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing why because christ in you has an open book and everything contained in him all of his nature all of his character all of it all has been opened and released for you to walk in and to have and to possess so he's calling you now he's calling you to lay it on the altar no more fussing with the devil and just tow him and just destroy him and cut him down because the sword is sharp that you're holding in your hand hallelujah and you see when you run towards the devil this is what's running towards him amen the breastplate of righteousness the fulfillment of all of it the revelation of the whole thing in you not your flesh and not your works but christ in you the hope of glory amen can we give the lord a handclap of praise tonight this is his division for you amen amen hallelujah hallelujah brother and paul you can help me sing this brother please every hour you are faithful oh lord every day and every hour [Applause] [Music] you are faithful oh lord you are faithful [Music] oh lord every day and every hour you are faithful [Music] every day and every hour you are faithful [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] is you are faithful for [Music] day and every hour you are faithful for you are faithful oh lord you are faithful oh lord every day and every hour you are faithful oh lord every day [Music] every day and [Applause] [Music] amen let's just pray together if you have a request or something has really moved you or the lord has spoken in any way to you to that that you've found an opportunity in your own life tonight you just signify that before the lord with an uplifted hand as we pray lord jesus father we are just so grateful for your faithfulness great is thy faithfulness o lord and tonight lord jesus father i believe lord we've exposed the devil and the national spirits and all of these hindering things but lord we've also seen how you lord have come down and you're amongst us and you're not ashamed to call us brethren and you're you're not ashamed to dwell in these bodies lord and lord give us dominion over all of this the prince of the power of the air lord he's defeated and he's under our feet and we're going to walk in the victory and if any trait tries to poke his head of the past or of our natural birth we're just going to tread on it and if he comes and raises up we're going to run towards him and we're going to punch give him a good right hand lord by the word of god train us up lord teach our hands to all help us all to discern in the body of the lord and i pray lord that you'd help us to celebrate the glory of god amongst us lord i pray father you would give us the mind of christ and that lord we could see the supernatural take over if there's anything in my life anything in my life that is hindering lord help me i surrender my life i surrender all of the old nature and all of the natural spirits and everything that i was raised under lord i renounce it i surrender all that all many years ago old the sometimes lord it takes sanctification to bring things out it takes the lord a little trial to see that that thing just became a tributary for many years and we compromise with that lord but lord this is an hour lord where there is no compromise this is an hour of total deliverance and our god is here to deliver to heal to take out even the minute things because those stones must be honed out polished and perfectly fitted together oh lord under your vision under your great eagle eye lord anoint us father anoint the gifts in this body here oh lord we just want to celebrate jesus we want to celebrate lord the office of god and the ark of the lord and the glory of god we're a celebratory church lord we celebrate lord jesus you lord and each other we celebrate your grace we celebrate your deliverance we celebrate like they celebrate it when they cross the red sea and the enemies was destroyed we celebrate lord jesus father like they celebrated over the enemy's heads when they were down lord and those young people stood on the head of the enemy kings hallelujah as youth that were on fire they were in victory that all these little devices of the enemy were destroyed hallelujah through the blood of jesus christ and today we take our opportunity this evening right now i take my opportunity to walk in the entrance to walk in and toe the line and come into my jubilee and to be restored back to all my inheritance this rightfully mine that was given to me by my new birth oh lord let the contents of the open book be revealed that we own and it's all part of us and give us the mind lord jesus of christ let this mind be in us and be let us be renewed and if there's anything lord in any of our lives lord that is hiding away sneaky little devil i pray you shine your light down in jesus name we depend on you lord and we look unto
