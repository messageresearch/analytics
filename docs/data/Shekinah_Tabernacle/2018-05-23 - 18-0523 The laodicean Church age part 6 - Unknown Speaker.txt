========================================

but I like that she said you know Satan tries to put all these things in front of us that are all lying vanities that we he wants us to chase after which all would just pass away but but see yeah something that's the Word of God eternal things are the only things that are really worth ultimately worthwhile and that's the Word of God and and souls in life you know that's what's worthwhile but it was just straight moving she said that Satan puts all these liabilities in our path to kind of follow me follow me do this come here do this do this and they're actually all lying entities they all you know we we have to do these things but they all pass away there's a song it says build your hopes on things eternal and and as I was thinking about the thought you know she said you know reading the Word of God is actually eternal that there's something you can do that's eternal of eternal value things that we would overlook and Satan says no there's nothing in that but actually that's where eternity lies you know and and and just getting into the Spirit of God being in his presence is actually eternity and that's that's something of value may we always press into that and may our lives just be continually refreshed by the Spirit of God that's when that's when everything is okay even when it's not let some stand and we'll come up the service to the Lord this evening Lord Jesus we're

I mean thinking realizing Amen thank you positions Amen good evening everyone trust you're all well amen I bring greetings back from Taranaki I mean I heard the service from my brother Andy on Sunday it was quite a blessing so praise the Lord I'm glad amen let's go to if you've got your Bibles handy we're going to go to we're going to go to 2nd Kings chapter 2 second Kings 2 and verse 1 we're going to read down to verse 14 it's great to have brother Andrew with us god bless you amen see and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah from Gilgal and Elijah said unto Elijah tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto him as the Lord loveth and as thy soul liveth I'll not leave thee so they went down to Bethel and the sons of the prophets that were a Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto Him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from by heed today he said yeah I know it hold ye your peace and Elisha sodon't unto Him Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord loveth and as thy soul liveth I'll not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets there at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto Him knowest thou the Lord will take away thy master from my head today and he answered yea I know it hold ye your peace and Elisha said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord love and the liveth and as my soul loveth I'll not leave thee and they too went on and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle unwrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither ather so that they too went down over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over the light just said unto Elijah ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from the inn Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of my spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing give less if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so they came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and depart imparted them asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw and he cried my father my father charit of Israel and the horsemen there off and he saw him no more took hold of his own clothes and written them into pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell upon him uhsorry fell from him and went back and stood by the Bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and see it where is the go Lord God of Elijah and when he also had spent in the waters they parted hither and thither there's a and Elijah went over a me and made Lord blesses word you may have your seats tonight I want to continue on our series on the lady AOC in church age and you know the second part of revelations chapter 10 it's it's our portion of Scripture where John is commanded to take the book from the angel and eat the book and prophesy again and so it shows there is a continuation of a ministry from where it was once a a one-man ministry of a prophet now it's a ministry in a multi-member body so we I trust you have realized that you're part of that ministry it's not just a preaching ministry or fivefold ministry of ministry but it's a you know of preaching but it's also every part of the body is part of that ministry I mean a helper of government a a musician a song leader a a sunday-school teacher mom or a dad or you know every every part of the body functions in this ministry amen now Elijah here if you want to turn back to first Kings 19 he is commanded by God to go and and do certain things and one of them is to call Elisha now in the story here I'm going to use Elijah as a type of Christ and Elisha is the church so you only who I'm talking about I'm talking about the Lord and you and ultimately you got to follow the Lord all the way from gilgul across Jordan and receive a double portion of us earth that's when you can really be put into the ministry but we see here in 1st Kings 19 that God tells God tells Elisha and we'll go and we'll go from verse 16 sorry of first Kings 19 and all go from verse 15 and the Lord said unto him go return on my way to the wilderness of Damascus and and when thou comest anoint has your to be king of Assyria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel and elisha the son of shaphat of Abell abel mahalia shalt thou anoint to be prophet in my room and it shall come to pass that he that escaped at the sword of has you'll show J who slay and him that escaped earth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha Slade yet I have left me 7,000 and Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Bale and every mouth which hath not kissed him so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he was with the twelfth and elijah passed by and cast his mantle upon him and he left the oxen I ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto Him go back again for what I for what have I done to thee and he returned back from him and he took a yoke of oxen and slew them and bawled their flesh with the instruments the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and he went after Elijah and he ministered unto him so their head so they came a time where where where Elijah threw his mantle his prophets mantle upon Elijah but it didn't fit him yet he had to go through a he had to go through a discipleship with Elijah in the camus season where the mantle would fit him but you see he was so this mantle as as the Holy Ghost we're gonna have church tonight are we all awake are we all here Amen so like so what I really want to get out tonight is you know Christianity is not learning things it's not a feel theoretical understanding or just some doctrine but it's a life that it's expressed in you it means it must be the life of Christ has to anoint you and dwell in you and then you are part of his ministry in this end time right it's not just it's not just you know people can turn the message into like the Apostles creet say a creative beliefs and then you're a believer you know but it's more you know it's more just saying some words it's a life that must be lived it's a life that must be expressed and so Elijah was called to be the Prophet sorry Elijah was called to be the prophet after Elijah he would continue on Elijah's ministry and just as just as Elijah was call to continue Elijah's ministry so the Bride of Christ is upon the earth to continue the ministry of Malachi for amen because there has to be a living witness of the resurrected Lord Jesus and every generation the Prophet has gone off the earth he's not going to return and preach some more he's not going to heal the sick raise the dead he's not going to you know he's going to be raised to manifest the life of Christ of the earth amen his power minister he's done right he's been taken off the earth now a bride has to come to her position and Elijah Elijah couldn't come to his position when Elijah was there he had to be taken out of the way then that same anointing that was upon Elijah fell upon Elijah for a double portion of it because Elijah to-date miracles Elijah did for right but it was the same life was the same anointing that was on Elijah fell upon Elijah and when it fell upon Elijah then he could do the ministry he was called to do okay this is where I'm going that's basically my summary now we're going to catch up to it just so you know where we're going okay so now so a lie so Elijah he was already you know he had basically he burned every Bridge he killed the oxen you know he he had nothing to return back to and has to be the same thing you got to make up your mind I'm going through Jesus I'm going all the way I'm not just here for a Sunday picnic or be a part-time Christian I'm walking with you all the way I'm not just going to start I'm going to finish I'm not going to stop my race I'm going to finish the race I'm going to cross that finish line I don't just want to start and get stitched and pull off to the side and you know I'm going to continue with the stitch hallelujah I'm going to continue on and so Elijah was determined he was determined to follow him all the right and then so finally they came a time when there was a transition period where now Elijah had to come into his position and it has to be and we're living in that day amen as I said we're not brother branham will return with the resurrected Saints but it's all over then amen but he's not returning to preach right we can't just play tapes this gospel must be lived in every generation the Apostle Paul didn't tell them just write out my letters and send them though those letters had to put on flesh and a people and then the ministry had to preach the word right brother Browns asked a question does the bride does the bride have a ministry in the end time and he says very simply yes it does so here's a question would the Bride of Christ would the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture II says sure it's going on right now see the Bride of Christ certainly is the message of the hour see the Bride of Christ she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right congregation says they mean there's the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry the ministry of the hour says it'll be so humble so the bride has a ministry and I'll say this if you're not a fivefold ministry member you're not just here to prop up a ministry right you have part of the ministry yourself amen you say well I can't sing I can't do it you can create an atmosphere I mean you and create an atmosphere and worship their God comes down I mean you can create an atmosphere and God comes down and breaks the yoke off someone sets them free I mean changes the whole order of a service maybe it's you know kind of just wafting around then you say all on faith pulls them down and God moves I mean you're not just here to prop up some ministry you're part of the ministry we all need one another we're as important as one another there's no big use and little Me's or other way around amen hallelujah I'm glad we can all put our shoulders to the wheel Saint Lord let's get across that finish line let's get the job done amen so we have a ministry at the same time now elijah follows the larger all the way he he doesn't just start start but he follows them all the way across Jordan they noticed us they start and it's the same with with every Christian journey you know we don't just we don't just repent and stay there right we don't just accept them as as our Lord and Savior and stay there you got to keep walking that's the beginning first you must believe he is entering water of him that diligently seek them right seat so you start off with that but then European to me baptize them the Lord Jesus Christ you're showing this world in the next world who you're being United with right but you don't just stay there it's a glorious thing to repent it's a glorious Center get baptized beyond just stay there we're to go all the way right and then so we start there with justified so we we can start at Gilgal just like Elijah with was with a larger Gilgal but Elijah was determined something in him said that that that that that road that that fell upon me that made me walk with you it's it's mine to wear later right you may feel a little tug on your heart that's the mantle coming upon you to try and call your to get your attention you know God just doesn't want to walk with you wants to be in you I mean he doesn't want you to have someone else's testimony he wants you to have your own testimony he wants God he wants to live in you that's why he died on Calvary heaven is my throne earth is my footstool where is the place of my rest he asked in Isaiah and you should be able to say Here I am Here I am Lord on the place of your rest Here I am Kolia thank God is wanting appeal so here I am just like I was there in the temple Here I am Lord send me right so we're the place of his rest amen but you see he didn't stay it he you know he didn't stay there at Gilgal but then they went to Bethel just like you start you know you're justified by faith you're baptized in his name I mean you know you're identified in baptism but then you must go and be cleansed amen you must go be cleansed so you go to go to Bethel you have another experience where God cleanses you takes the desire out of your life I mean for the city you know you know if the sins of the world and you know you know sanctify you cleanse you sit us sit your side for service and that's a glorious thing it's a glorious thing for when you were once a slave to the sins of the world now you're free I mean he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed holy you went a little bit free we're not we don't have a bracelet thing on our ankle and when we walk out the house the alarm goes off and the police come I mean we're really free right we're not on home detention we were not at least we're not in prison I mean all you were at home but we're still asleep we're not that way we're really free amen he whom the son sets free is free indeed and he says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's a power and the truth to make you free that's why it's not our power trying to make us free there's a power in the truth of this business that will make you free hallelujah I'm glad is a power stronger than me that can set me free amen just like we're having glorious fellowship last night about Simon of Cyrene Jesus carrying the cross up Calvary and he and he can't carry it anymore because he's bleeding he's wounded he's mad beyond any man but there's another man there who's stronger that can carry the burden that he can finish his ministry right as the same thing we make it under a big weight but there's someone stronger than us you follow one say he is the Lord Jesus it's not just a Gentile watching in the crowd but he himself comes I'll help you be your burden that you can finish your ministry amen God carries us you know us little children like carry me just pick them up off we go holy he just picks us up off we go amen but they came out okay no see he came to they came to Bethel and it's glorious to be sanctified but he didn't stay there and it's it's interesting because even the Prophet the the the school of the prophets they knew that Allah was going in a rapture so so they knew all this was going on but they weren't part of they weren't part of it because Elijah was one that was part of Elijah being carried up okay and then they come to Jericho and then they go to Jordan now Jordan represents death and you see as only those two that went to only those two that went to Jordan now Elijah had the power to part death that they could walk across so his ministry enabled them to part death so they could walk across Alleluia he had that mantle he smoked the he smoked the river amen in the and the waters parted death parted they could walk through death to the other side and then there came the point now so Elijah is where he wanted to be in the very beginning it's wonderful to be at Gilgal Bethel is a wonderful place Jericho can be nice too you got across Jordan you got across Jordan you can't stand those other places they may even look at you know you got to go all the way you don't follow this word all the way gotta follow the Lord Jesus he doesn't want young Gilgal or in Bethel only he doesn't want you in the start he wants you at the end right and then so now here he comes he says give me a double portion of your spirit he says if when you see me go you know if you see me go then you know then you shall receive it and then he saw him go they were parted in that same mantle that wasn't Elijah now fell to the ground and Elijah picked it up and you see what he does does he goes back to that same Jordan and he wants to see now this ministry that I've received cannot part death that people could walk over and he says where is the god of Elijah he smites the Jordan Amen if he's really the same God prove yourself that you're still the same if that's a bit bold I don't know but he's saying you know where are you where is the god of Elijah because otherwise that do no good to walk all that way and follow him for all those years and then it just comes to a well Elijah to this and Elijah to this and brother Bram did this and this was this testimony there's no testimony today right there's going to be a living witness we are a living witness I mean the bride is a living witness more than an argument more than a debate but a life this one has to be a life in you right because God will have a voice in this last day and it's a lived voice brother brems here's what we need in jeffersonville a Menace thousands of lives voices that is the thunder that shakes the devil as the same thing I'll just trade jeffersonville for Wellington or wherever we're from that's what God needs has lived voices I mean because that's the thunder that shakes the devil and so he receives that mantle and men he smites thee he smites the you know the River Jordan and aparts and he walks over it and there has to be the same thing with us we're going to have a ministry they can part death that people could walk through more than just healing more than just prophecy right more than just speaking in tongues all those things are wonderful but a ministry that parts did that a people can walk over to a different land right there are people can really see the life of God and they more than an anointing but God's abiding presence in the soul hallelujah and I'm so glad we have that Amen that the waters can part we can walk over walk over into a new land a new way of life hallelujah but then he comes back now and they you see but these proper these students of the schools of the prophets they didn't believe that Elijah had gone and they go looking for him and they can't find him but now Elijah starts in his ministry and he continues on he continues on from where we are Elijah lifts off now here we are this is where we are right we the same life that was an Elijah as now the same life that was in Christ is now in you right just like just like with the Book of X H the same life that was in Jesus came into 120 and his ministry continued on and his ministry is still continuing on amen and that's what God wants he doesn't just want us to hang around him he doesn't just want us to be part of the school of the prophets he's not interested in us learning some kind of religion there's a lot of schools of the prophets today and people learn how to be prophets you don't learn to be a prophet you're born the gift and calling it God is there a vocable right it's already there you can't learn to be a prophet God takes you and places you in an office just like you can't learn to be the bright God makes you the bride because you always were the bride just like David's there he's looking after his father's sheep and when Samuel goes to Jesse's house Jesse doesn't call David he's not even it's not even in not even in his father's mind that David may be included and then and then Jesse brings his sons one by one brings him in front of Samuel Samuel sees the first one he thinks this one must be the Kings big tall he looks like a king God says no I've refused him and then Samuel sees what about the next one next one comes in next one next one next one this is do you have any more I think Jesse says I actually do he's not here we'll go get him so the unlikely one was the one hallelujah the unlikely one was the one and then so he comes he comes David because God Rory told Samuel in Jesse's house I have my future King he's already there and he comes this little boy I don't know skipping along I know what he is doing but here he was God sees my king that's him he's sure that's him God don't make any mistakes right and then he and then gets anointed by that vindicated prophet that prop that anointing was emptied out upon that vessel and that brought that kingship to life and then from that moment he began to walk just like Elijah was walking with Elijah he was walking with that anointing because the word says that the Spirit of God was with David from that day on so he begins to walk and God begins to teach him well was his first lesson he comes a lion that's his first lesson and it and he kills the lion and then here comes the bear he thinks well I killed a line I can kill a bear so he kills a bear he gets victory over that and then here comes here comes a Goliath and this is two King Saul well I killed the line I killed the bed this one will be the same as then doesn't matter how the devil dress himself uh but still the devil amen he still defeated our Lord Jesus defeated him on Calvary so what this one comes against me I'll kill it I'll kill that one I'll kill this one amen if one chase one can chase a thousand I can I'm not going to spend time counting for a thousand I'll just kill them all I mean sham girl wasn't worried or how many are they cannot do it no he just he just went with his ox code jumped out brother man said jumped out the window charged it then because he was a circumcised son of Abraham and that was enough the Prophet says Amen if you're the Bride of Christ that's enough hallelujah just take what you have and go you say but it's awful small weapon that rock down to giant hallelujah one Rock and also David staying there he's looking at this giant and he says today I'm going to cut your head off and he's got a staff and he's got a sling and he doesn't have a sword and his wife making his boast and the very thing that's going to take his head from his shoulders he's carrying hallelujah and the devil you know ultimately the devil just looks like a fool amen but God allow such things to happen because God wants to prove his salvation to you that's why we don't need to worry right we don't need to worry I mean God is proving his word in your life when the enemy comes in like a flood or raise up a standard that's the anointing in you Alleluia so now David David yo he just follows just like Elijah was following and he follows that prophecy that he was going to be king he was so he was so dead sure it was a revelation to him faith is not a hope so faith as I know it right there's a big difference between hoping it'll happen and knowing it'll happen if you know it's going to happen it's done but if you think it's going to happen you're not sure right just like brother brain sees and works as faith expressed he says the Israel I mean the army of Israel knew they could defeat yo they knew it could be done they knew Goliath could be defeated you know but it was only in mental knowing is more like a hope this is my language more like they hoped it could be done because the mental understanding of the wood but David had a revelation that it could be done so he had faith it could be done because it was revealed to him it could be done amen that's why you know that's why this world tries to mix up our mind so much because he's trying to get our mind off the promise we just have to only believe only believe means you don't bring out bring anything into it only is only believe you only believe you don't maybe weigh it up and consider this consider this now you don't consider it I think you just only believe only believe right that's what we're cool to do is to only believe answer David so David you now if he's going to become King in the one who's already on the throne is going to be taken out of the way in God's timing he didn't need to worry about how was going to happen he didn't have to do any political maneuvering and try and win the hearts of the people and work out how he just he waited he knew in God's season he would be ready and Saul would be taken out of the way that's exactly what happened amen and then he also knew that you know he had confidence that God would keep him on the throne when he was even when epsilon raised up God knew here take care of it all ooh yeah Amy and brother bmc's here and yeah now you see me three stages that Elijah followed Elijah Elijah was the type of Christ Elijah the type of the church I go up to Gilgal first justification by faith and he said now you stay here to the church Elijah to Elijah the young and the old prophet a type of Christ and the church he says as your soul lives I'll not stay here but I'm going with you and he went up to Gilgal and when he got up there he said now you stay here the Lord is calling me up to the school of the prophets and he said as the Lord lives and you're sold me of ad I'm going with you I'll not leave you that's the church see keep your eyes on Jesus wherever he moves go if he goes out of the Methodist Church go right out with him he goes out of the Baptist Church go right out with him he good if he goes out of bread them out of the Branham Tabernacle go right on with them I'll not leave you no matter what your mother belong to me your Papa belonged where this happened to another I'll go with you I'll not leave you hallelujah I'm your witness I can't go you're part of me come on and I'll follow and he goes to school the prophecy said you stay here and some of the prophets said to Elijah do you know your master will be taken from you says I know it but hold your peace Amen I like that I'm going to stay with them no matter what the rest of them say and Elijah turned around and said now you tarry here for God is sending me to Jordan three places justification Gilgal sanctification school of prophets and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost at Jordan where Jordan represents death notice Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost right down to the Jordan dying out time so Elijah walked right on down to the river with Elijah and when they got down to Jordan death last stage of the journey the old prophet reached over pulled off his mantle struck the waters and the waters divided hither and thither and the to walk that cross was on dry land and the preachers stood off looked at them go across amen when they got on the other side now after I hope this soaks into the Branham Tabernacle plumbed down to the marrow of the bone not when he was at Gilgal not when here's at the school of the Prophet neither when he was on the on this side of the Jordan but after he had crossed Jordan following him every step of the way you're willing to say except Jesus my personal Savior I'll quit my bad habits but come down to Jordan where you have to die out where all the things of the world all of your friends and everything has forsaken you keep your eyes on him alone 19:53 witnesses hallelujah that's what we have to go I trust if you haven't been there you should go let me recommend it to you amen because that was the only way Elijah could continue Elijah's ministry amen as when that same anointing came upon him then he could continue the work of Elijah and it must be the same thing with us the very same life that was in Jesus Christ now comes upon the believer and then that life now lives out of them amen now he sees here does in the angel of God in 1948 so the hour has come for the repeat of the Bible and the fulfilling of the word now God promised that he was going to send a former rain in the letter rain and he promised the former rain in the latter rain in the and and and a letter and in the letter in other words a double portion like the garment of a of Elijah when Elijah dropped that Elijah picked it up and had a double portion and he was a he was a type as a type of cry of the church and Christ Christ was taken up and the same spirit that was upon Christ is on the church tonight the Holy Ghost seen Iblis if you see me go away shoot Elijah and he took the garment and he struck the Jordan and said let the god of Elijah speak amen and it has to be it is the same thing today I want you to I want you to recognize what you have I mean we can't take for granted the very at the very life of God is in you it's a very precious thing God has put you into service I mean put you into action that his word can be the continuation of his ministry can happen in your life they mean just like Paul and Silas was separated and we'll Paul and Barnabas whoever it was you know for the work to continue in different ways in the book of Acts is same thing with us I mean because that same life comes into us and and it continues on I mean more than just a more than just a church gathering but God's life being expressed upon the earth that's what he wants to do hallelujah I must be the same thing with us so notice he went all the way I'm just going to close with this he went all the way over Jordan and then it became his testimony it has to be the same thing with you and I but I've trust wherever you are in your journey you've already made up your mind if you haven't even if you're still plowing with oxen and you're in in your old life kill the oxen burn the bridges go walk with God you got to make up your mind you can't just say well I'll start with mummy and daddy because there you know it's an individual affair with God individual walk with God there comes a time where he takes you by the hand someone will take us by the hand first our parents lead us then our teachers lead us and then and then maybe our paths will lead us but there comes a time where who's going to lead you after that amen who's going to lead you after that because they will have to you'll have to let go of them and then you get to walk with someone else and there's a place where no mortal can take you there's a door called death no one can take you through that door only one can take you through the door and he's our Lord Jesus Christ and he's the one you want to ultimately lead you from the very beginning right and God can use the mum and the dad which he does and and the teacher and them and the preacher but there comes a time where he's got to lead you brother Brown preaches the sermon leadership and he's preaching to the Pentecostal people people who knew the miracles of God and he preaches that service leadership who who's who's leading you it sounds like a Sunday School lesson but he just lays it out to them don't reject the leadership of eternal life don't be like oh I'll just bring it into that story we were it don't be like the school of the prophets just standing afar off I have religion I go to a church I learned some things you know just standing afar off and they're not even part of what God is doing we want to be following the Lord in this hour amen we have some we have the musicians please I'll just leave it there I trust you've made up your mind I made my mind up when I was 22 it took me a while God was dealing with me for a long time finally I quit I gave up I didn't care about what family said or what friends said or whoever said I didn't worry about them they'll take care of themselves it's me ultimately it's you you can't worry about what other people will say it's young God you know well you know when it's all said and done you'll yeah we'll all give an account and I want my can to be I laid it all down I followed you all the way and of course he knows that before he even I need to say it amen and and that's what I want my testimony to be in 2007 I ceased to be and he began and me just like Enoch Enoch what with God was at 365 years or something well no no he was alive that long the first 65 years of his life he did his own thing he walked with God 300 years and then God took him but they came a time in his life where he SH he ceased walking by himself and then he started to walk with God and then and then God took him in a rapture as a type of you so it doesn't really matter if it was and Enoch was you know maybe you know ultimately it has to come a time in life where you walk with God me takes you and you're not that should be our testimony so be like Elijah so I'm going all the way I won't take my eyes off you until a double portion of your spirit rests on me so you can continue your ministry upon the earth it's not my ministry it's not my life as you continue your life in me that's what Elijah wanted he didn't want his own life he didn't want to be like one of the schools the prophets trying to make a name for themselves he wanted God's name to be declared he wanted God's ministry to be lived they should be the same thing with us shouldn't it I meant I don't even want to be a footnote in history I'm not interested I don't care if I'm forgotten if I disappeared tomorrow no one remembers me that's fine as long as God has remembered right as long as God is known I'm satisfied I mean this bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious father just pray father we want you to live well that's what we want Lord that's what our desire is father that it's not our will it's not us living anymore but it's you living Lord like a lash and Lord he followed Elijah he knew was more than a man he was following he was following a your prophet you were dwelling in Elijah he's following him until until that same anointing Lord that was you rested upon him rested upon all rested upon Elijah and then he was put into service Lord God that your work would continue on upon the earth no that's what we want Lord that your will would be done in earth in this earth this living clay that we are Lord your will be done in this earth as
