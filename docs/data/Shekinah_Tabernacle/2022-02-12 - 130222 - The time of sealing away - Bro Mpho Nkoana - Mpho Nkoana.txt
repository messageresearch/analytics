that you have and maybe you want the lord to answer something for you in your life this is the opportunity for you to lift up your hand and say lord consider me lord you know how long i've been struggling with this situation lord you know how long i needed an answer you know how long father but this morning it's me and eulog lift up your hands with confidence before the lord because he is more than able [Music] lord jesus gracious and most high god father we can do all we can but after all is you father at the end of the day master is you it is you who died for us it is you who created us it is you who called us it is you who saved us it is you no one else and that is why father we come we lift up our hands father in our hearts before you we speak like david when he said i was late when they said unto me let us go unto the house of the lord this morning we are not only glad father but we are thankful to be found in your presence i pray heavenly father that you bless each and every heart i pray this morning oh god that we just be still and know that you are god amen when you come and provide for the needs of your people get me out of the way lord jesus for thou know my weaknesses for down down thou father god you know my shortcomings there's nothing further that i can bring even me i depend on you this morning i pray that you just be the provider be the answer may you be that manner that your children will pick this morning fresh from that by curry this morning lord as a collective and as individuals we ask that you forgive us our iniquity we are sinner men and women born and shaped in iniquity nothing good can come out of us only by your grace father only by your full knowledge only by your predestination only by your grace we can stand that perfect sacrifice the lord jesus christ is the only one that we come in through and i pray that you you give us thy favor this morning and bless your people may each one at the end of the service take something in their hearts to chew upon to ponder upon to go home and regurgitate it and eat and suck every mineral every vitamin that you have provided yes lord jesus is our expectation this morning lord we just want to commit the service into your hands in the name of our lord jesus christ amen good morning friends greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ i thank you brother isaac for the music for the songs and all the musicians may the lord richly and abundantly and exceedingly bless you as you take your seats and the minister was late this morning you can see that this one is not a regular this one [Laughter] so as we i was actually referring to the musicians when i said can take your sis but it's okay that will perhaps help us to just to relax in the presence of the lord how many have had a wonderful week how many have had a good time in the lord you see for a believer is evergreen do you know evergreen for a believer is evergreen that doesn't mean that things are not happening in your life in my life no no that doesn't mean that what it means is that it does not change you whatever happens high low flat sideways whatever happens whatever the enemy brings your way evergreen ever smiling ever happy not ever angry i mean so and um i i want to just to set up myself here my phone is on flight mode i just want to be able to see the time this morning and i'm glad i welcome each and every one of you brother among us this morning we still welcome sister megan and we welcome the lord jesus christ this morning he is our best vvvv vip this morning that we are welcoming and also i welcome each one of you friends please welcome yourselves be at home i believe this morning that your benefit of eating the word of god this morning is not dependable on who is preaching i believe this morning that you're eating of the weight your your your your your provision this morning is not dependent on the minister or who is behind the desk right you use you and the lord this morning we welcome also my give my girl we welcome also mike here and um so it's not dependable on me it's not dependable on who whether it's your friend but i'm preaching this morning it's not dependent on whether can i make it a bit strong it's not dependable on whether it's your enemy preaching i know there's no we don't have enemies here in the church but i'm just trying to emphasize the point it's not dependable on whether it's your husband preaching huh it's not dependable on whether it's your dad or your friend or who is preaching or the one that you is preaching how do you perceive him right it's not dependable on none of those things it is dependable on the expectation on what the lord has laid for you uh for this day for today amen are we together believers so now i want to welcome also our friends in video land our friends in streamland and um i pray that there as you are watching with us as you are joining in in the service with us that the lord can bless you that the same atmosphere that is here in the service is with you over in your room at home in the office in the little corner i pray that the lord can bless you i wish i could see and say hello to you amen but the holy spirit is not um it's not um blocked or it's not uh cannot be blocked by the waves of the internet the holy spirit cannot be at this or stumble blocked by any connection whatsoever the same atmosphere that is in here can be right now in the next room by sister jennifer can be at home with someone else can be right now in cambodia cambodia it can be in la la or it can be in pakistan right now the same atmosphere he's the ever-present god and is the ever-present help in the time of need so this morning we are going to read and then we just read one scripture and then we sit down then we will read the rest so i would like you to relax and in the presence of the lord i believe you have come expecting and let's read the book of revelation chapter nine we read revelation chapter nine we are in the presence of the lord this morning let us be aware of that let us be aware and not take it for granted it's not just coming to church every sunday we are in the presence of god being when moses was in the presence of the lord as we have had on wednesday brother onions as we have heard when he was in the presence of the lord things changed so when we are in the presence of the lord you know is worse than when you are going for an interview you know when you go for an interview have you ever been in a panel what is called a panel and they are all sitting around the table looking at you only the nervousness you you don't know what to say when so we are in the presence of god this morning is so serious more than that interview and that's how we need to be aware and all our senses must be aware and alert and be able to take the foot from the peak of the mother our great mother eagle feeding us don't miss revelation chapter nine uh we shall start from verse three we'll just read two verses revelation chapter nine uh my bible see if you read your bible too much sometimes it gets torn and you don't want to throw it away revelation chapter 9 the bible says and they came out a smoke locust upon the earth and upon them that that was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hate the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have no not the seal of god in their foreheads let us pray once more heavenly father we know we can eat too much talk too much exercise too much drive too much walk too much but we'll never never pray too much we just we just feel to talk to you and say father we have read your weight we ask your blessings upon it lord your word is in the interpreted when it manifests in our lives i pray that you anointed that you anoint both the speaker and the hearer alike this morning we depend on you my father my god we just commit the service into your hands this morning by faith in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you please enjoy the comfort of your seats amen so let me um i think i'm i'm also fastened up this morning i would like us to speak about a thought that says the time of sealing away the time of sealing away how many know the meaning of the word seal not the one there in the ocean but a seal you know when you seal an envelope and you close it and you put a seal on it and you send it away right or you're sending a puzzle and you seal it which means um there is something that is inside that envelope there is something that is inside the puzzle or the seal behind the seal there's something so you seal it with something inside and you send it away you don't put everything in there you put only the things that are supposed to go in there kuriya and you seal it are we together so we want to talk about that time of the ceiling away which is now the time for me and for you to be sealed the bible says until the day of our redemption so so now if you expect this morning you are going to receive so i can see expectation on your eyes you are even scaring me you you're making me never so i'm going to look i'm going to look right above your head so that uh the lord can take over and give you not me amen so we have read there and then i would like us to read before we just expand on that topic i want us to read malachi alaka chapter 4 we know the scripture am i right we know the scripture uh raise up your hands there in video land we are in the same service let's read malachi malacca is the last book of the old testament malakai we know the scripture very well but i just want to i want us to read it so that we can emphasize on it we'll read malachi chapter 4 from verse and verse 6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord i god will send you elijah before that day comes that is it that day will be dreadful but it will be great and he who allied shall turn the hearts of the fathers to their children right we know that has happened right and the heart of the children to their fathers and that time is now otherwise the bible says lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so that before god can come and smite this earth with a curse the heart of the children must be turned back to the heart of the fathers our forefathers right at the beginning our forefathers lived alive we can see it in the book of acts we can see it in the uh um gospels right they have lived alive they have lived with the lord jesus and they went and wrote it our forefathers we see through the life of paul those are our fathers in the faith right and now that was the beginning of the gentile dispensation and now we are at the end of the gentile dispensation what was at the beginning must be at the end are we together so we are just going to try to take it easy and a teaching type of a a service and if the lord saw it see it fit will preach in there amen i always like the preaching but the lord sometimes wants to teach because the prophet says teaching it it takes you to a different level amen now now that this is the time where the hearts of the children must be back to the brothers this is the context i want to give you that where we are today as the children the pentecostal children our hearts must be turned back to the fathers whatever happened to them whatever they did whatever they went through whatever god used them to do must come to pass in our life before god comes to smite the earth so the question is are we there yet are we getting there right because they walked on the street of jerusalem as they were walking their shadows the shadow of the office of of peter was it peter just touched a sick man and he stand up and he's healed them they were at the point where they were tortured they suffered and the bible warned us and said hey consider it all joy prepare to suffer right remember it's not you who's suffering it is just the flesh you are not this flesh it's not it's the flesh that is suffering but you your spirit is joyful because you are not of this world so now consider it a joy when all sorts of persecutions and torture and whatever comes your way and i can tell you now brothers and sisters it has just begun it has just begun this is the time and that is why it's important for us to talk about this title ceiling away because the prophet taught us that even the bible that to be sealed away by what by the seal of god that has already you are in no more argument no more debates that means it is very very very very critical it's very important for you for me to be sealed away because while we are being sealed away while we are being sealed and ready for be to be couriered into heaven there's also a ceiling another ceiling out are we together the enemy you see there's always two spirits we'll see as we go along god is busy with this process the devil is busy as god seals the devil wants to seal also as god is fighting the devil is fight so we'll see as we going along so our time for sealing away as the bride of god is now it's not the time to change us to make us um the bright it's not the time to change us to make us something no no you are you are a bright you are the bride you were predestinated to be a bride but you must come to a point of the manifestation of who you are that's what you are you are right all we are doing is ministers all we are trying to do but all what the prophet is trying to do all what the gospel the bible is trying to do is just to try to bring you as the seed to the fruition to where originally you were that's all so so so let's let's let's get ready to be silting to go back to our original picture the picture that the lord saw when he created that's all we're doing right so if you find that it's a bit uncomfortable that is a bit rough that is a bit no no don't fight it up accept it me include it accept it because that is what is taking you to your original state how you where you were before the prophet says we are going back we are going back to aiden as condition help brother andy always push it this thing is crushing me a bit i'll put it here somewhere maybe i can put it on the jacket we are going back to uh adam we are going back not adam to eden yeah i just want to put it here on the yeah yeah i think it's just see what the brother is doing is just quality assuring it that you can also take it as the process of sealing away because right now he has checked it i'm comfortable here he makes sure that i'm not it's not scratching me if you leave it like that then that is not a complete sealed product because it's bothering me but now it everything must be quality assured you must be quality assured before you are sealed away are we together so sailing away involves tests and trials it involves temptations it involves torture it involves happiness it involves peace that passes understanding the peace beyond what you are going through the peace beyond what the devil is trying and once you get to that point the enemy does not know what to do he's frustrated the enemy because he knows that even if he kills you there's nothing he can do absolutely nothing he actually i think the devil sometimes just prefers not just to kill you yet because he thinks maybe he can still you know divert you so so so for him paul told him clearly for me to die it's a game to live is christ so with a believer we are way beyond this flesh brother indeed so now this is the time when we need to come to the realization that we must be sealed away and make sure in my language we say and make double sure yes let's read ephesians chapter one ephesians one i love ephesians how many loves are visions i love the book of ephesians let's just uh read it calmly taking our time it's sunday morning today and uh if you see me preaching you must know that all the other tyres are fully booked all the other tires i'm the spare of the space so so you must know that all the other tires are fully on the car working their threads are finished are getting finished they are working so we have to take the space of the space which is me so don't be don't be don't be surprised if sometimes i miss something just eat because an eagle knows how the mother eagle feeds you so just enjoy because as i told you it's not up to me who's preaching the eagle knows the cry of the mother the smell of the mother the kind of food the way the mother feeds the eagle knows and that's how i want you to fit that way this morning right ephesians 1. we'll read it from uh verse 18 to 14. are we together oh yeah thank you my brother for coming with me i forget this thing the bible says listen to this carefully in whom he also trusted after that he had the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he was sealed with that holy spirit of promise did you get that did you get that yes you are sealed with the holy spirit of promise so there that that is the seal they're still starting to image the seal is starting to emerge what seals you the holy spirit that's the seal of god that is the one that the lord uses to seal you in you know when something is sealed let me show you something there you see you see that picture now the thing on the side has gone through a rigorous process in the factory it has gone through a process of being cleaned being checked tested everything and then they take the contents that are in that thing and they also make sure that the contents are of good quality to be exported to be exported to important clients who already paid the money and they checked how long why is in the sheep transported how long it can last in other words they take the best of the best quality and they put it in there after a thorough process and then they put it in the team the cleaning must be okay tested quality assured the contents in the teeth same thing same process and then when they finish the machine comes brother onions will know in the factory then all the other engineering brothers then they they seal it that team that thing you cannot open it for you to open it you need something called a tin opener you need a a knife when i grew up we never used tin openers we took a knife and we just go on the side you can cut yourself because that thing it is sealed until the day of his redemption until the day of redemption of the contents now it is after sealed then they put a stamp a seal of approval the quality ashore is a great job if you are a quality assurance because you are the one the last man who checked this thing before it goes out the day it goes out it's out and there at that process where they do quality assurance some goes by the wayside this one no no still can be put on this one this one no this is what no approval no the belt of approval goes this way then they go they go sealed sealed sealed not approved they just fall in the tinder we are going to throw those ones away hell now you and me we are those ones that are being sealed as we speak into heaven and until the day of our redemption right so the day i buy that tin attack and save and i open i'm actually i'm redeeming are we together so now efficiency said um i'll go back a little bit again all right ephesians said ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise the holy spirit is a promise and you are sealed with it right now verse 14 which now listen to this exciting verse please let's be together just enjoy listening which is the earnest of our inheritance do you know what is an earnest and ernest when when we say something when you say um how can i put it you see when you go to the shop and put a bond or you put a deposit you see you are putting an ns you are you are depositing something that thing belongs to you they cannot sell it you have deposited it potentially it is yours actually not even potential it is yours right now the endness of our inheritance the endness of our inheritance is the holy spirit it when you are sealed with the holy spirit that is the earnest you are you have made it into heaven so how important can that be that the purpose of our daily life every second thought must be to make sure that you are sealed to make sure that you are ready because the bible says the bible says you don't know the day and the hour of his coming but he makes sure that you are sealed to work out your salvation with the fear and trembling knowing not he can come any minute you know that he's coming he has given you the seal you must make sure that you live the life that correspond with that ceiling are we together which is the endness of our inheritance until the redemption of the patches possession you know that verse you can just repeat it over and over and over every day unto the praise of his glory so the enemy of our inheritance is the holy spirit it has it's been given for us it's been given to us as an anus as a deposit right now which means you are his you are in once the seal of the holy spirit is put upon you you are in but now can i reverse it a bit can i reverse it if you are not sealed what how am i going to know how are you going to know that's the question we need to go back to say ah it's not just a foregone conclusion it is a falcon conclusion that you are a child of god but what do you do and the fruits that you bear actually illustrate or demonstrate whether that is true or not is it hard to say that is simple so your fruits shows that ah this one has been sealed this one is not sealed what you bear every day so we need to be careful and make sure that the fruits that we bear right the fruit that the lord jesus bear through us the fruit of the spirit the fruit of the spirit that's what we are giving every day are we together another scripture ephesians chapter 4 now this one this one have cut it a little bit [Music] and ephesians 4 verse 8 right it says here and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed this feeling is very important now imagine imagine that content in the tin will start to temper with the seal and grieve the seal what should what kind of a commotion would be imagine if the contents in the envelope start to bulge and and do whatever sorts of things is tempering with the seals if he starts to misbehave if you start to grieve the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption that's dangerous so we must not grieve him the question is how do we grieve the holy spirit right and that may be the topic of some other day but grieve him be led by him right go according to the leading of the spirit every day amen we are sealed until the day of your redemption now the greatest thing and the greatest uh uh interest you know i forgot these classes are not the right ones for long distance they're just for here but i can see because i've got to copy him what is the greatest ambition for every believer what what should be the greatest wish you know we say there's a vision and there's a mission what is the greatest purpose of every believer or what is supposed to be because the prophet taught us that without that holy ghost sealed into your soul we must not even dream about the rapture so i can speak in tongues i can preach i can go to church all my life sister megan i can do anything i can feed the poor i can do anything love everyone my guru right and do whatever on this earth i can do but as long as i am not sealed by the holy spirit do you think i'll arrive at my destination that's the purpose of the message being preached that's the the reason why we say when you go home fit on the way when you go home pray when you go home have a closer relationship with the lord when you go home do your checks and balances in accounting we say you do your checks and balances why should we do that if we know that we bought we bought using a bank account for the church we bought all these things why should we be submitting financials brother isaac because we are doing checks and balances to make sure that everything was done properly correctly enough to the letter that's the reason that we do our checks and balances using the weight every day of our lives it's not a foregone conclusion that i got baptized i felt like i received the holy spirit that's it then i can live anyhow no no it's to every day and every hour to walk in the spirit to make sure because the devil he knows that is important therefore he creates an environment a setting of environment to deter you from exactly doing what i'm telling you from leaving each moment each day each second for the lord so he will create a setting around your life and he'll make it necessary he'll make it important for you to to wake up and pick up your phone every day because it's important i must look at my time he will make it so pleasuralized business work everything until our minds also they think fast we are just fast fast fast fast why because you cannot if i leave you god might take an opportunity on you so so us we have to be wise and know that our routine does not take us away from the lord to allocate time for god because if we don't redeem that time don't you think that will be unwise because we don't know when is the lord coming we have to be ever ready i cannot over emphasize that now to be born of the spirit to be born of the spirit that is what i'm saying we it's not enough just to be just to be baptized it's not enough it's not enough just to be justified it's not enough to be sanctified it is important that's the portion of the holy spirit but the ultimate goal is to be really baptized that's the ceiling point that's when me and you you young people you all time us make sure that our faith and our work does not become sterile are we together now the testing and quality assurance checking happens during this process this is the time when and the product is on the production line is moving on the belt via different stages moving towards the end of the process where it gets sealed and me and you with the with the endless expectation given unto us that's where we are and i'm telling you one of these days we're just going to jump into the courier bag of who we are one of these days it's going to happen it's about to happen all the signs are showing that is going to happen the problem is when and you are being set free and you need to be sealed and the holy spirit wants to seal you put for the rapture to take place and you are resisting you are not resisting by saying no i don't believe this just your actions just allowing the devil certain environment to control not allowing the holy spirit that is resisting because now that is a problem because it shall come to pass that in the process of your resistance or my resistance it shall come to pass that you know what they did to those slaves who did not want independence who did not want their freedom then they took them and then they make a hole on the e another seal that is a mark then they mark them and make a hole here i don't know whether they were cutting a piece all the way making a hole so that that is a mark that this person they shall never they get their freedom their liberty their guarantee their fate at it so we need to be careful that our day-to-day life that the enemy does not take grasp of us that the holy spirit which is already given to us as the seal takes full control of our lives to guarantee our going away yes sir hallelujah so let me just go to the next one here i've got the first quote we we spoke about the seal of approval we spoke about the process of how that tin that product gets to the finish line and how is sealed and the importance of the contents and we have spoken about the rigorous process that it goes through and that's me and that's you you need to see ourselves as that team getting a seal of approval which is the holy spirit hallelujah now let's just get to that first quote now some people come to church just for an emotional part some people come to church just to sing if it's not you it's all right it's okay if it's not you it's all right but if you if you can identify with this if you find that coming to church you get more help here than seeing for singing than the word that is talking to you then are we together some people come in church just to enjoy a good singing that's all right man the singing today was beautiful so what was the minister preaching about um what was he talking about you see now you enjoyed the songs they uplifted you which is wonderful but that's not it right some people come to church and join church just to hide their meanness you know that so that you you cannot just know my other part my other nature just to hide you know when when you are among the believers the atmosphere around the believers it can even it can even soothe the most dangerous person it can because the atmosphere is overcoming this atmosphere is so good that any evil person can be among us and just be calm that is why when the mother is about to give birth they say the prophet taught us that you know a calm spirit around him because the angel angels are here right now right that is why evil demons run around they don't know they are frustrated they are calling for support they are calling for help because you create an atmosphere through the singing through your preparation your expectation your prayer through the week praying for the service and then the atmosphere of the lord is here even the person who came terrible terrified comes here and he's just he or she just get caught right so now some some come to church sincerely did you hear that they come sincerely but they don't never have to attach from god that is this is painful come to church sincerely where am i okay some people come to church some come to church sincerely but don't never have to touch a touch from god i i don't know how to express this painful state of affairs where you come to church all the years you come to church faithfully all the time sincerely you know to be told that you are sincerely wrong something that is so painful it would be better if you are not sincere at all because maybe the lord maybe you didn't know but you know and you are sincere but you are you are not having it that is painful now and the only thing not my intelligence not my wisdom not my experience not my nothing but only him only the holy spirit he can sincerely put you on the right strike correctly to be sincerely correct only he can do that and he he's got everything in the hands in his hands he's got everything he's that is why it's important for us to seek and to have him and to make sure every morning you say holy spirit my dear are you here yes my girl yes my boy i am right here with you is it you how can i see you today in my life and he shows you the manifestations of his deeds and actions he manifests them to you in your life and you wait and learn from the holy spirit to see and then you come and testify the deeds of the holy spirit in your life using you speaking and conversing with you on a daily basis that is the job of the holy spirit we we need to pull back and allow him to do but the flesh fights death we don't want to be sincerely wrong we don't want to be sincere and come but never get it never get to the point of being sealed but you see when god calls a man no man can come to me except my father draws him first it is the work of god but you see like brother ben always say god is not the one who just pull you and force you there's a part you choose him the choosing of god and giving and surrendering total surrender to him then that's when god does this yes that's when god come and he actually draws you and put you and seal you but you give everything surrender everything no reservations like when a woman surrenders to a man and he says i surrender to you as my husband and we give him the authority he gets the authority now the father is no more having authority to the girl anymore it is now handing it over to the new husband that's what happens in that process that's what i'm trying to emphasize to you now no man can come to me except my father draws him now throws him first and all that comes i will give him everlasting life raise him up at the last day that's what the prophet said then people think just because you go to church no no no my brother and sister just because you come to shakayana tabernacle doesn't mean anything it is a good thing it is a first step but it's just year one i'm sorry to say that but coming to sakana tabernacle is not part of the whole deal so oh that's all i have to do just to go to church be a pretty good fellow that's wrong brother you are deceived that's the prophet of god that we believe is him saying that just just to come to church alone is not sufficient so it is the life behind coming to church the life the life of you and the holy spirit i know t going slow make people relax and then you can you can end up snoozing but remember here as we said at the beginning it's like less than an interview you see when you're attending an interview even if one of the panel members can sit like this and he says yeah tell us i see on your cv here you said this this this and then he sleeps a bit the panel member you are awake you see him that ah this guy and that gives you more confidence that hey i'm gonna nail it even the panelist is dozy so you need to be alert because this is more than that listen to what i'm reading him because most of this that i'm reading here is not out of my mind it's not what i i just copied and put here all i'm doing i'm just putting the emphasis on what the prophet said right so it is the prophet who preached this in 55 he is the one who preached in 55 03 12. he's the one and he said that's wrong my brother you are deceived is not just coming to church hallelujah help us my father my god now while coming to shaykh is extremely important because we cannot forsake the gathering together we can we have to fellowship it is part of the deal it's just part of the deal we cannot underestimate it we cannot develop it we cannot put it aside we have to come together to fellowship to to for the world to be pleased for us to participate that is part of the deal but the most most the cracks of the matter the core of the whole thing is my life that has been sealed away in the lord that is the deal that is the main thing second coat where am i about to go if we if we have served the lord you christians all these years it's time we were getting off of the the milk diet time we were able to eat some strong meat the strong meat is here for us it's time no it's time we cannot keep on brushing each other say no no no no no no no it's time for us to say hey sister that dress that you are wearing because why why am i saying that the prophet says here if we have served the lord you christians all these yes i'm not talking about a new believer there a new believer we understand and the lord will leave that person he or she will see our lives we'll experience it and go through the same process that we have gone but no me and you have been here for many years but you still want to be told how your hair should look like and your dress and your pants brother no those things will pass them they are down the line of the production line we are almost there where we are getting sealed to get out those things are behind there we are now moving higher almost to go home the same way we saw him leaving we're gonna see him he'll say to us come up either and we that's almost there so how can we still be struggling with the dress how can we still be struggling with ah no no that that brother no i don't like the way he talks i don't like it it stops my insight are you still are you are you still but the bible that i read me and you it says do not be easily provoked do not be easily provoked in other words the devil will come to you and kick you and kick you in a mean way maybe even use your brother or your sister no how are you going to react i don't really i really i really don't want to show my colors i don't want don't don't pull me to the extreme which extreme which extreme don't you want to be pulled to are you still having reservations not supposed to no more reservations you can pull my nose devil you know that man came to the prophet and they even did he they even pulled his nose and they said yeah take a picture now what did the brother do he remained calm hallelujah he remained calm because he knows who he is you see he's not he's not he's not confused by what the devil is doing he knows the devil is childish they say no no now come take this side then they did they did the same thing with jesus they did the same thing even at the cross they were spitting at him saying prophesy what did he do what did the lord jesus christ do he said lord forgive them he said you know when someone said to you you must run [Laughter] you must go back home and prepare your life because that person said is pitting you the lord said lord and that was true that's the best the lord could do to forgive them because they didn't know what they were doing that's what the lord said so the pentecostal brothers paul salas peter he said they said them they said no no you know what you know you know brothers and sisters no no don't worry don't crucify me this way the lord the way the lord was crucified you know me put my head upside down yes put me in the inner inner prison are we ready for that that's coming it's coming right when it comes it must find us sealed strong meat we need now no more milk milk is for my precious friend danny and them right us real fera bread steak to chew eat brother andy the one that is full of vitamins not fully done rare still with minerals what do you call it rare because if we eat it with those minerals like that no gout will affect us knock out of the devil we eat it like that cooked with minerals follow it fresh from the peak of the mother now listen to this find that and he said well let me show you something this is now a a a a young man talking to the prophet about the mug of the beast he's talking to the prophet he said okay he said well let me show you something the poor boy can you see what i'm reading the poor boy was of course in an illusion and he pulled out his pocket a great long piece of paper and that that had the statue of liberty on it he said there's a mark there's the mark of the beast the stage of liberty you know the statue of liberty in washington dc the one that is doing this he was telling the prophet that that's the mark of the beast an illusion and that's that's happening today again well we have had all kinds of rumors and i wrote them that thing in red is me conspiracy theories you see i cannot specifically tell you which conspiracy theory is exciting or not exciting they are all conspiracy theories the issue is that me and you must have a seal and whatever conspiracy theory true or false still brother sister that's the key still that's right and there will come many of them because even during the prophet's time he said we well we have had all kind of things and rumors they were there conspiracy theories people actually believe that the statue of liberty is the mug of the beast and today we are told that the mug of the beast is this the mark of the beast is dead you must be careful of the mark of the beast no no we must be careful that we have the seal that's what we must be careful about we must be careful that we are sealed in by the spirit of the living god by the washing of the waters of the world that's what we must be careful testing that's the first priority whatever is going to happen afterwards is immaterial is neither here nor there because listen whatever conspiracy theory can come let's say it comes to be true that i get tracked getting into a controversial territory now i'm aware of that that i get tracked by a vaccination let's presume that that is true okay let's put the hypothesis it's true right hypothesis meaning we are hypothetically saying as we are doing this research we want to test whether this is true or not we are putting an alternative hypothesis and a a hypothesis right we put it let's presume the hypothesis that is true that i'm vaccinated i'll be tracked then what what happens after i've been checked okay let's say that now they want to control me right now who didn't they control people before didn't they control people of old they anyhow they are controlling us but they are controlling the flesh you and me must get the seal that's the issue whether they're going to tell us to vaccinate 10 times and i die i want to die and go anyway are you ready to go imagine i was telling your brother yesterday i said imagine my brother i was talking to who i was talking one of the pastors i say imagine imagine if me my wife and all the four kids die god forbid because you still want us here imagine we still want you also imagine if we all go that will be the glorious glorious glorious moments for us to realize oh we are going together on our guys and there is our mansion already waiting us amen already without waking we don't know and we're all just going to say oh that vaccine was useful man lobby now please understand what i'm trying to say i'm trying to emphasize that our point of focus our point of priority brother and sister our time our efforts our energy our research must be getting on the seal and making sure that that still is maintained is there by you it does not grieve the holy spirit right that should be the priority otherwise afterwards once he was sealed he's the one who's going to control what you say what you do what you think how you react what every day is him you don't have to worry get him first don't be like a girl who wants to get married without the holy spirit no no friends no it's an end oh get the holy spirit then you get married to because him he will guide you to the one who is full of the spirit already right once you got it my girl i am free to let you go sister now free i'll be happily handing you over sorry i'm not your physical date but the point i'm trying to say is that once you've passed that stage it's not nothing to worry you don't have to worry not anymore he's the one who's guiding you you are not thinking your own thoughts anymore you are not acting your own actions you are going to find that you are sitting in kapiti but sitting in taranaki and isaac is sitting in an orcas but you're all thinking the same thing because the same spirit is on you you're not arguing on facebook no you're not debating because the spirit in you is the same that that was that was not part of what i prepared to speak no i want to say that this whole is the same spirit that was in christ jesus if he's in us we are going to be reacting or acting the same way as the city we are going to be thinking same line or it's like a puzzle you know a puzzle when we pick a puzzle sister maggie and we spend our time putting it together another piece doesn't say no no no no we don't cut it to make it fit no we don't we don't cut that portion to to force it no we don't do that it just fits nicely if my brother's got a strong point his strong point if this is my weak point it just fits onto my point like a hand and laugh ah and then i've got a strong point on my side and he's got a certain weak point that the lord has given to fulfill his purpose they just fit into mine we don't crash no no that's a problem that means that's the wrong puzzle it belongs somewhere it must go onto another another piece of the board huh and and and that brings us to someone maybe one day where you finding your position in the body finding your position because finding your position is so important in this body you are now still in the holy ghost navigates you and plays you positionally in the body because every part of the body has got a role to play every part i don't know what part you can mention and you say it's useless that's not your part the one that is useless it must it must go away it is a cancer it must be cut out out of the body but every part of the body has got a role to play then the importance of that role is known unto the owner of the body the head the head everything that's the same one for another time i want to finish quickly let's go to code number three i hope we've exhausted that one if we exhausted code number two that's fine code three let's see what he says there you must be born again to be born again we all know what is to be born again but you must it's not a you may be born again or you ought to born again or you know your mass is a must amen jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god let's go down to verse seven mother not oh sorry let's just read verse six that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit me and you must be born by the spirit mother not that i say unto you you must be born again because you must be born again that was nicodemus engaging with the lord trying to engage and to talk and now we find that as we go forward here in the spoken word called you must be born again the prophet says okay that that rate is not the prophet that's me you can put it on the bench if you don't swallow it nicely and i said you must be born again first and to be born again you must die first you must die first because let's be practical let's be practical have you ever seen a seed that we plant huh and it doesn't die but it grows and bear fruit without dying have you ever seen i've never seen if you plant a seed after a few days you go and you find that it has a reason road is fraught in africans we say fruit in other words rotten you will think there's no life there why jesus died in the cross and he was buried amen our souls are placed by faith on his on his on his brass altar god's judgment as we speak now we you are on the judgment seat you are being judged so don't say it's hard saying brother no no because you are being judged the world is judging you because you are not going to stand before the judgment seat you are already judged because by accepting you you are put on the brace on the brass on god's judgment and our offering is consumed now remember when elijah under those brass skies laid the offering of god upon the altar the offering was consumed by the fire that's what me and you are going through now so the weight is judging us right now baal could not consume his offering he could not i don't want to say this but i must say it and when you go to a church and accept their creeds and and and their forms of baptism and the offering that you are supposing yourself to lay upon them you might get up shivering speaking in tongues running all over the floor and you might get up weeping but if that offering has been received by god is consumed the world is dead to you you are gone for we reckon ourselves dead and buried we are dead and are we are hit in christ hit in christ and beside that then then after we are dead and buried and hidden christ then we are sealed with the spirit amen you see where the ceiling comes after the death dying to ourselves dying to our nature not get angry to have one without no no we don't do that so do you do to someone that i'll get so angry no no you haven't died you haven't died die let us die let braden paul die to himself and that scripture that the pastor right here then the new nature the spirit will be given so that the holy spirit can come and seal hallelujah i'll try to go fast now let's read the next paragraph there die to yourself you see what i mean now you are dead our souls are placed upon his divine judgment that's brass when our soul is placed upon the altar of divine judgment what was the penalty death and when you lay yourself upon the altar of god which is pronounced dead upon the sinner it's not actually you who's dying it's a sin i knew amen he dies and you live a new life right all our birthdays i think should be the day that we were born again how about that proposal you know the song that says when i was born again oh it was a happy day you know the song oh it was a happy day oh when i was born i gave a tissue one day he said it was a happy day when i was born again that should be our our birthday's from marion from now on we'll take it through the past and the deacon board and said brothers can you ratify that from now on our birthdays is going to be the day that we were born again that's the real bad day i want to jump quickly to finish right um let's jump to the next slide i want to emphasize on this point of being born again because many times we just take things easy and for granted and we presume that we are we are in but if we can be given a test an exam we may find that we don't pass 100 percent and with the lord pass mark is 100 not 93 what am i saying brothers and sisters i'm not saying you are unbelievers i'm saying there's a need for us to do our checks and balances all the time continuously why because the bible says the pastor read it last week on sunday he said um those that what does it say hebrews those that fervently seek him what does it say who knows the scripture um i want to talk about the one that says those that are do up to the end those that um um who is my bible readers those that are uh uh you see the same shall be saved those ones do you want us to read it the same shall be saved but it is those that that that endure that's the way to the end that's the way i'm looking for thank you sister norway those that endure and that endurance is not something i give myself and i say i can make it man no no the lord comes and pours himself in you and you endure until the very end the same shall be saved your salvation is not going to come at the end it's already given you're going to be all what is happening at the end is just a manifestation of the beginning done done deal finished we are in that's us when we finish working we say that's us we are done and we go home when we get to that point after enduring we are saved we have to enjoy now i'm going to jump this one let me see right i want to jump the whole of it but now i'm on the screen yes but i want to read for you here this portion here jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now we are getting down to what born again means you see still with tempest still mean arrogant somebody says something about you and you're right i'm ready to fight and then born again of the spirit of god i cannot be born upon again of the spirit of god when i'm like that no god's spirit don't do like that no god's spirit is humble meek sweet long suffering that's god loving kind forgiving unconditionally forgiving your sister before she even ask you that's god's spirit oh yes the prophet says that is a sign that you're born again you have to be born again by this holy spirit not by some demonstration no demonstration will make you born again right but when you're born again there's demonstration that comes but the demonstration cannot you make born it cannot be made to be born again hallelujah filled a finished work god into the work a finnish work of god into the kingdom amen i know i get noisy but if you you felt like it i did you'll be noisy too you'll be no easy if you know the god that is in me the prophet told that infidel that you know the problem you don't you don't have the god that i have but if you had the god that i have you talk the way i talk you see the infidel was upset now let's let's look at that quickly in closing we know that process am i right brothers and sisters justification sanctification and a baptism of the holy spirit all those are good but let's start here you are not sealed by sanctification the prophet says you are not sealed by certification you are you are sealed by the baptism of the holy spirit a ceiling is a completing of the work that's the reason it couldn't be sealed under luda wesley either one it has to come to the baptism before the church was sealed away till the day of redemption you see it's now it is this time that is why we call this time a very blessed time because it is at the end of the end and you are placed there what confidence did god have in you of course he did have of course he knows that you must be at the end of the lap he knows that and he's got full confidence that what he's put in you from the beginning even you may not see it you may not be aware but it's there he put it that's why he made you to live now otherwise god wouldn't wouldn't bring you here he would have made you to live in the dark ages but god said ah i'm taking the best of the best amen hey gabriel what do you think i don't even have to consult you gabriel i know i'm taking the best of my best team to the seventh church age of laodicea and according to my records they are going to make it exceptionally some of them are going to get 101 percent you so all i'm trying to say to you is that hey if you are still there by 83 you the lord saw you 801 percent pass you got some time to conscientize you you know when someone loses conscious we bring we conscientize them we do all sorts of things hey cpr we kick them you say that that will hurt that person man no we are resuscitating we are not hating him we do all sorts of things wake up you can't die now you see so we are trying to shake those are still at 83 percent thinking that they've got a distinction no the distinction in the lord is hundred percent amen now this is otherwise we are risking that that's what we are risking we are risking to be sealed by the devil and the devil doesn't see you in he seals you out you see that's the problem that we are there's a risk if we cannot take it so seriously this issue give me 10 more minutes then we are done you agree with me i see you're all awake and i'm proud of you but let's just read that carefully you see now to reject the truth when is presented then your ears are sealed which is not this year's spiritual years and you don't hear no more and you think you see but you can't see no more that's the risk and and you know the painful truth is that once you get still like that the painful truth is that you are not his in the first place and that's not you i'm not suggesting that's you all i'm saying is that we are fighting such a crucial battle worse than the one for russia in ukraine west that's a serious battle we can't afford there's no second option in this battle we have to be away every time missile ready to shoot any day any minute from all angles to shoot because we are protecting something so important nothing should stop us from going to heaven nothing and we shouldn't presume that we are going no be sure be very sure that our salvation that our lives that every check and balance is done be ready to self-critique yourself and be aware when the devil is accusing you and when you are looking and evaluating yourself don't allow the devil to to accuse you no bring the weight that's why the holy spirit him he will help you to say yes he'll talk to you and you are aware ready to listen and to say yes the way i spoke to brother and you was not right call my brother sorry brother andy i'm condemned as i'm sitting here i can't sleep i think i feel i didn't talk to you properly my brother would you forgive me but we don't you don't find that nowadays which holy spirit is leading us you don't find that you don't you know not even to apologize just the condemnation alone when it comes so suppressed we don't we don't we don't want to feel it we don't feel it anymore have we been bored on our ears or not let's be careful let's be careful because if he is the potter we are the clay which means he can mold us huh we can mold us we know that it's not about me personally it's the body are we together now to reject the truth is not living the word of god is is to reject the truth is to not leave the full word of god when you don't live the full word of god you are rejecting the truth right refusing to die to yourself right not bearing the fruits the least can go on and on and on and on but the point i'm trying to say is that all those things just demonstrate where you are at and the spirit of god the light that is still flicking in your heart actually is still a hope for you and for me it's a blessing to be criticized by the lord towards righteousness it's a blessing i say thank you lord thank you for thinking of me my lord my savior for showing me where i'm as correct must never be bound by culture of not wanting to be corrected of just wanting to be an introvert who don't who just want to without saying i am glad or god bless you just no no no no no no children of god are expressive and we are noisy of course not all of us but the point i want to show you is that there's two spirits why i'm bringing that seal of the devil is that there are two spirits which has been operating from day one kind and evil jacob iso they've been like that up to today the bright denomination huh they are there he wants to stifle the able today who that to the cane of today that's what he wants to do right i won't read through that hole but the one all i'll read for you there is that if you can see what where i'm reading in the middle there now they are going to to be so much like alike those two spirits the the spirit of cain is a religious one now some people say well communism is the mug of the beast you are wrong communism is not the mark of the beast yet it is you can you get that the prophet says communism is not the mark of the beast yet it is but it is heading up the the mark of the beast the marco is a religious nature very religious so cunning sly until it will deceive the very elected if it was possible just so close till it will deceive the elected if it was possible so close that's the two spirits so we need to be very careful that like like we preach the last time the message of religious spirit that we are not just under a religious spirit in the message that there is a lie behind the name in my daily life same with judas and jesus so we'll jump that one and go to this one because i requested only 10 minutes so that means from here it's just a few slides then then then we go home uh right we're reading that one that says from from also the seal of god the seal of the christ oh i hope you see it brother and his work of the holy spirit revealing to the individual not upon some emotion not upon something you should do or shouldn't do or this or that or other or the other all those things are all right emotions and things are alright but they are just a cat the horse is the holy spirit you see emotions we are emotional people yes but our emotions don't supersede the holy spirit all those things are all right but the first thing it has to be a supernatural revelation of god that give the individual that jesus christ is the son of god calling that's right without that brother you are only impersonating only pretending amen that's what the man of god says there so excitement and happiness it must be the one done by the spirit all the gifts everything comes after that they are under the control of the control tower which is the holy spirit the real seal right let's read the next one you are separated people when you come to god a royal priesthood is you you are it's not you may you will be if you do that no no no you are now all what you are trying to do is that we are just getting this fruit to his ripened stage are we together let's jump to the next one otherwise my time is finished um i will read brother almond oh yeah that's two slides that are the same okay that's all good now the prophet here is talking about by the time titus was besieging israel he was surrounding the walls of jerusalem going to destroy them right he says otherwise before the great destruction of 1896 titans seeking the house of jerusalem this the city the holy spirit went forth first before titus you find it in the book of ezekiel where it was prophet prophesied when the prophet of god was in babylon and he spoke about that time 600 and something years before it happened right he said the man dressed in white with the markers a pencil on his side to put upon a mark upon men who sighed and cried for the abominations that was done in the city there are people who are crying and praying for the abomination of the city amen those are the ones who got the seals and when the seal upon them now those ones the angels went out the holy spirit is out today to mark them to seal them still still still sit sit sit he's busy stealing them he's at work since still see right because they've got the presence of god in their lives he's still in them now once they're sealed they go then tatas they come now and he destroys the city so you are the ones that are busy being sealed today the angel in linen the white man in lenin is the holy spirit he's the one who's busy silly silly silly silly get still make sure you get sill cry for the ceiling sighing and crying not arguing not being toast about by all the rivers going that way the hard river is full today we are flowing that way today tomorrow is not flowing we are stuck there in the shallow no not toast about sealed by the spirit of the living god crying sighing every day for the abomination of the city next slide what we need tonight is a lot of these here hollywood evangelism check down and an old-fashioned godsend revival men and women who get down at the altar here and quit this shaking of hands and holy and and holding up hands sprinkling them and baptizing face forward big words all that and all these other little form of isms and get down to the real concrete broken spirit where sin is mix that together and start the old fashioned crying out of a newborn child that's the kind that gets the holy ghost that's the kind of the people that gets a seal those ones no matter whether they are methodist baptist catholics or whatever they are when they get before the altar and cry day and night oh lord look at the sins of this city my heart has had my heart can't rest i can't rest lord and i see these things going on oh god do something send us an old fashioned revival you are on the borderline of getting the holy ghost my brother when you do that yes sir you're on the border you're just getting it and once you get it let me tell you the news once you get it can i tell you you are gone you are gone no enemy no devil no spirit is going to reverse that there will be no more reverse game you are in you are in after that interview whatever you are never shaking the moment you hear the call they say mr bondo i'm sorry so from such a company i'm telling you that you are successful what do you do the rapture has taken you is history the rest so that's what we are striving for brothers and sisters not all these isms the prophet says not all these things around us yes let them exist they are here for the purpose but they cannot deviate my attention they cannot deviate my attention my focus is that one think about christ for telling of christ coming in isaiah chapter nine think about it when isaiah said for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder why i'm reading this scripture why there was no sun at that time there was no sun that was born but he was there you see god you see the prophet when he was seeing the visions and he was seeing them in present tense god is an ever present tense god he's not a yesterday he the same one of yesterday he's the same one today he's got no past tense you see when you get into the dimension of that realm the real you you see things as they are when the child is going to be born 500 years ago i mean to god to come you see the cvs now you see when you see something that happened that time during the olden days of the apostles you see it as now amen you see that's why the prophet saw adam and eve he said he says no i can see them they are working god gave them god put some skin is working power on their feet their blood is dripping i can see them oh he sees them in a different realm i pray that you seeing yourself in a different realm this morning reptilian going through the gloves you see ah i've never experienced this what a happiness what an excitement the reason i'm reading in that scripture of isaiah 9 is because in ephesians also he says that he might present himself a glorious church having no spot no wrangle not it may happen it has happened at the time he saw the church the bride he saw him christ was sin you were seen you are sin perfect and ready and that's what we're striving for that's what we want to get towards that's what we are getting towards now that he might present himself a glorious church not having spot or wrangle or any such thing but that he should be holy and without blemish no blemish on his bride and that is you for this cause a man shall leave his wife and mother i mean that shall leave his father and mother i'm sorry his father and mother is he that is why the lord left heaven he left heaven to come here for his for his for his bride he left everything and come here to die because it's a serious business transaction this one no money can afford it in conclusion you have been chosen so let's live up to the choosing because you have been chosen not that movie of the chosen you have been chosen you know when you get chosen neither sorry my girl when you get chosen you know you think deep that this man out of billions of girls on earth at his disposal and he chooses me what kind of choosing is this one listen you are chosen i'm not telling you a fable you are chosen and you must live up to the choosing it was a costly choosing all we are trying to do is to preach as you as you should as we should he time of to have a time of remembrance to bring us to the remembrance of actually who we are the recollection of who you are right to reignite the fire in us by preaching the weight hallelujah i trust that you have been following me and i trust that you caught the thought of the ceiling away we have to be sealed away brothers and sisters and there's no further way to explain it without that ceiling without that seal there's no rapture there's no going home and we have to make sure we don't doubt that we are chosen we don't doubt but we have to make sure that we shall be very sure be very very sure and we'll sing that song hallelujah may the lord bless you it's exactly one hour 24 minutes that i've taken i'm i'm improving oh be very short be very very [Music] [Applause] those that know it please me oh be very very strong and is that sister travis mike on there she can help me just [Music] only one oh be very very sure [Music] this rock is oh [Music] [Music] yes he's [Music] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] oh [Music] as we are reverent before the lord we want the lord to really take our anchor and let it grip on that solid rock that's what we are after this morning let's just lift up our eye our hands and close our eyes as we surrender this service back to the author and finisher of our faith we are not closing the service we are just attending it to the lord so that at the right time at the right moment he can open the service for us again to come and fellowship if there is a need among us lift it up before the lord believe that when you pray he will give you what you are asking amen how many have got a need before the lord let's just bring it before the lord in prayer our heavenly father once again we thank you this morning for your love for your grace we thank you my father my god for the reminder we thank you lord lord that you brought us to the remembrance by the god that you have provided a seal of approval for us to access and be sealed until the day of our redemption my father i pray for the needs of the people the hands are lifted up everywhere not only in the sanctuary but my father i believe also in the video land my brothers and sisters are lifting up their hands you can see their need you can hear their desires for them your hand is not shown and your ear is not limited my father to hear and your hand father god can provide is ready to provide my father you know the needs you know what they are asking from you all what i'm doing is to commit them into your hands all what i'm doing is to access the approval that you have given what they're asking for them we believe for the god that when we ask by faith lord you have already given to us because the bible says before you can ask i will have already provided and we believe it master what you are asking for today is to completely be sealed in lord what we are asking father is the reassurance every day that our seal still holds but our sin is not broken that's what we are asking for today lord god i pray that if there is any weaknesses among us i pray my father my god that the holy spirit can can just evaporate them if there's any weaknesses among us for god let them not be the stumbling blocks but let them be father god the stepping stones it's my prayer my father my god let our weaknesses be a benefit instead of father god something that pulls us back i pray holy spirit that you take us from here that we can be thankful that lord the enemy came our way to test us otherwise we would not we wouldn't know that god can save from adultery that god can save from uh for god can save from some other weaknesses from gossip from whatever it is otherwise we will not know if the enemy was not loosed to come and test us with such things among us we know that's not you that's the enemy bringing them to us but you allowed him lord how else were we going to know if there was no sin if there was no enemy how will we know how will you fulfill your purpose of being a savior you planned it all that is why you gave us a seal until the day of our redemption to close us after we have overcome the devil you seal us in father so that from now on no enemy can touch us so that from now on an enemy should be a stepping stone for us because he belong under our feet lord i pray my father that you bless your children i'm sorry lord that have taken a bit of a long time but for the god may you bless them bless their patience double it upload their patience double their love double their long suffering that will every spiritual gift the nine spiritual gift that you gave us may they manifest in this church now that we are sealed father now that we know who the seal is come father god we want the reality to live every day in our lives no more life of jokes no more life of perplexity no more life of easy calm easy goal we want the life of seriousness because we know that any time is going home going time we thank you lord prepare us fathers to be the actual priests in our houses prepare us mothers so that by the god we can be the god the gospel in the house prepare us children so that we can obey not only our parents but obey you father prepare everyone in their respective role prepare everyone to reflect you father we need everything from all angles to reflect you and what you have done for us that's our need this morning
