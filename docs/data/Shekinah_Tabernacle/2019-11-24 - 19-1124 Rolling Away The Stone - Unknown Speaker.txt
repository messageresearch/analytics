he's here among us the Spirit is here so mother's just start shouting now Amen why not I mean Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto Him Lord by this time he stinketh for he has been dead for days jesus saith unto her said not I'm said I'm not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of God then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead cometh forth bound hand and foot and grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go hallelujah litsa and they were also going to go to Ephesians chapter 2 then we're gonna read verses 15 down to verse 23 actually sorry it's Ephesians 1 and from verse 15 says wherefore I also after I heard of your faith and the Lord Jesus and the love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of us calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us would who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principality power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious Lord we want to thank you dear God it's such an exciting time to be alive Lord to see the fulfillment of your word Lord and not just Lord just around Lord around the world but in our lives Lord to see you bring to pass the great victory in love divine and gracious Lord I just asked as we Lord Jesus as we have opened the pages of you of your word we know anyone that can read can read it but Lord it takes you the author well it takes you the author to come and say this is what it means this is what it says so lord I just pray father may you come dear God we know Lord as we gather here we're not here to hear my mind or see a man but Lord that you had come and minister to every life so I did god I asked you to anoint speak her not only speaking but here also Lord of may just have preeminence in the service dear God we just want to commit our day into your hands Lord we're asking as well you'd be with all those who are second body Lord may meet every need among us Lord and be at those who couldn't make it today dear God may you grant it Lord Jesus and Lord we just want to tell you we love with all our hearts we thank you for a resurrection Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you might have your seats and also we're having communion foot washing at 5 p.m. today as well I want to I want to speak about rolling the stone away you know y'all want to continue from from where I was speaking speaking last last Sunday how you know the yeah it's gonna recap really quite briefly but you know there was a death Lazarus Lazarus was taken for Mary and Martha's house and we know the devil was to rob us of what we have of our joy our peace our love our victory and the Holy Ghost and you know I mean and then the juice came along as comforters and the devil comes along after he stolen something from me then he then he comes along and wants to keep you in an atmosphere of unbelief and self-doubt and pity party and you know just inwardly looking downward cast eyes and you know and and and and they they created that atmosphere in the house but then Jesus came because we know when when Lazarus was getting sick the resurrection and the life was on his way to their house Amen it's the same thing with us you know the devil wants to rob us of everything you know he wants to take everything from us he just wants us basically just to exist in life but you know there's something about life it cannot be contained you know and I'm talking about eternal life you know we know natural life yo the other world Trust it puts us in a box and makes us to conform to some image and just basically fit their mold but we know that we're not called to fit the world's mold we're called to fit the mold of the word I mean we're where we would be conformed to him as his image I mean the image of the word so you know so natural life we know it can be contained to some extent but eternal life cannot be contained you know something about life it expands it grows that your it increases that matures it gets better I mean and and we know eternal life cannot diminish it cannot get less it cannot you know weak and it cannot pull back but it expands it grows it gets greater is the same thing with our Christian walk I mean it gets greater every day it gets better it gets richer I trust that's your experience I mean it's not just a common story of our Jesus died one day for my sin and isn't that wonderful but it's a it's a lie it's wonderful it means more to you now that when you first met him I'm in the resurrection a holy I'm coming out of the tomb that means more to you now than it did when you first heard it I mean there's not just a story but it's a living reality everybody you know because he rose out of the grave you have risen as well earlier because you're his body upon the earth hallelujah and if the head has risen the body must rise as well hallelujah brother Brahim sees in Christ and mystery God revealed he says his body was not held in the grave recognized with him in the resurrection same as he is now he says less than what means this his word which he is has been begin to be risen the word that down through the age of Luther Wesley see has begin to raise up to its power there it begin to move and when it moved a little more now it's coming up to a identification see now watch now it's the life and the body is a vindication that the raptures at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to be received to the headship so he says that the very proof that the rapture is at hand is that God's life is and his people I meant God is now tabernacled in human flesh hallelujah so now is aces when it comes to the full measure of his manifestation now we know that you know as Christ was the second Adam there must be a second Eva must him be a redeemed woman and we know that that speaks of the church amen so as he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man now as the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a people hallelujah so that so that's why the body needs every part every joint supplieth every need I mean because he's a part of God and meat is the word and meat is the word in you when the word comes together then it can manifest or a multi-member body hallelujah I mentioned now you know to me it's so wonderful hallelujah he's alive holy and it's not just a historical fact he's alive I've made him in this day I mean he's not a God of history he's a God of the present amen he stepped out of history to me hallelujah hallelujah I'm simple it just makes me happy you know I'm glad he's not just a story or just a nice idea he's a living reality I mean so now we see that the you know the churches begin to rise in its power that you know we're not a downtrodden people no more I mean but the eyes of understanding have become enlightened he's opened our spiritual understanding I mean that we know that we're not just your trading on thin ice maybe we'll make it maybe we won't but we have a full assurance this morning amen that were being sealed into the kingdom by His Holy Spirit it is grieving not the Holy Ghost work by we're by your seal to the day of your redemption hallelujah so we have an assurance if you have met him you've met him and there's a purpose that he called you I mean that you'd become one with him and he cannot lose a part of himself hallelujah no I I'm just wanting to put these things out because we got to get to Mary Martha rolling the stone away okay so but you know it's such a wonderful it's such a wonderful realize and it's not in here it's in here to recognize that we have passed from death to life you know the sin questions been settled I mean the son questions been settled you know and what is that question have I been cleansed is there something that can cleanse me that I can gone to the prints of a holy God and not be condemned because you know only those without sin can enter into heaven hallelujah so now there's that question that we're all born with what can actually cleanse me can change me and mold me take my sin away that I'm born with my fallen nature that I'm born with what can change me to remove that that I can go to heaven now people do all kinds of things they try and reform themselves they try and you know oh but your alternative new page your new years and then then in a second and Jeff January it's turned back because they can't keep it there they make vows they you know you're they try and do all kinds of things but if the nature of the man has not changed then we will fall back into the same rut we kept tried to dig ourselves out of hallelujah so you know that's just how man is but I'm so thankful that that we have a perfect lamb we have something that's tangible that's real a faith a word that's real that can change us you know I'm just I'm just glad because you know you see his Lazarus was laying in the term there was someone on the present that could bring him out of the tomb I mean there's someone that has his body begin to be rotten you know that life that was in Marion Martha's house they rejoice again they grew up they saw him birth maybe you know then you was like to spend time you know that was not taken from him by the devil by death there was someone on the earth now that could take him out of the grave it wasn't now maybe one day one day will happen in the future no he was on the earth present palea the Messiah was on the earth then amen to race that man out of the grave and it's the same thing with you and I the devil do we have a glorious camp who had a glorious King who was shouting and then rejoicing in his fault let's just march into heaven right now hallelujah but the devil doesn't want to let you stay in that way he's determined he sees you rejoice he says no I'm gonna knock that out of them I'm going to take that out of them I'm going to bring them back down and I'm gonna get them to thinking their minds well that was just a camp experience but the devil wants to diminish because what God did at camp was eternal right he didn't just make you happy for the sake of it he wanted to show you the victory he's already given you but you need to recognize it's yours I mean if you know it's yours and if you've lost it you'll say I want to back Holly I want what I had or what my that feeling I had I want to be able to rejoice like that not just at camp but every day even in the presence of my enemies I want to rejoice I want to shop probably because I know the sin question is settled in my life the perfect lamb has come he's wash all my sins away I don't need to worry am I gonna make it I know I'm going to make it because he has told me I'm going to make it he's already told me in his love letter to me I'm going to make it because he's taking care of it hallelujah so you know but the devil doesn't want us to rejoice yes I'm not very expressive that's fine but what's going on in here hallelujah you know so so the devil wants to rob us of these things but now just as Lazarus was taken for Mary and Martha they came out of that atmosphere of the devil you're the juice you know comforting them you know keeping them in that darkness that depression that pity party they they left that atmosphere they came into the atmosphere the resurrection and the life and then but then finally Jesus asks a question where you laid him and then so they go to the tomb and and you know the the comforters the devil always follows along he's just looking for something to do he's got no original thought so he just tries to hang around where God is just trying to disrupt the program and so the comforters went went with with them and then Jesus Jesus called because we see here he didn't say Lazarus come forth and then get the stone rolled away that the roll the way the obstacle first and they had to do it and wasn't Jesus didn't roll the stone away he didn't say hold on and then he put his little frail body there and push it away no he was calling Mary and Martha the the members of the bride that had to what was taken from them to be restored to them I mean they had to physically put their hands to that trial had to put their hands that obstacle and they had to push it away you know it's very easy to rejoice when you know you know we talk about the Lord's of resurrection the life and he's here to break every chain and he's here to set us free but when he says now now you've got to take part not that you're the one that does it but you've got actually put your faith into action he follow me you actually have to do something and so he says to them roll the stone away you got to roll the stone away you know oh this this depressions beating me down you got to roll it away you've got to make a choice ain't gonna put up with it or the thing that's between you and your joy and your peace are you gonna push it away what are you gonna do it's the emember brother card really sure can't the power of decision you've got to make a decision ain't you gonna put up with a tombstone we can roll it away how thick is the thing that you lost is on the other side what are you gonna do oh jesus will do it no he'll give you the faith to do it right just like brother James is preaching being made in His image on Wednesday I'm so glad that God's given divine favor His grace is fallen upon us to become his word right hallelujah but you know you've got to lay your hands on it not anyone else you you've gotta you've got to push the thing away hallelujah it's not a nice idea when I talk about joy or peace or love whatever it is being restored it's not a nice idea it's a reality as a tangible something that's living hallelujah so now but you have to we have to put our hands to what's our obstacle what stands in your way you know Goliath will come just like against Israel he make his boast same enemies just come out in the open and they challenge and they challenge spirits come and challenge you others like the other thing was the Amalekites or the M right so it was coming and take Zig leg as the devil that comes in behind but what are you gonna do he just gonna live with that loss you gonna say it's mine I want it back you have a choice you have a choice but you see her reaction to that was but he's been dead for days it's been a long time physically physically he's rotten any and he did begin to rot they didn't embalm bodies in those days his nose priory fallen his brain was already rotting away maybe the you know everything was gone out they said yeah but but lord he's thinketh it's been a while since I had this life back in my house this joy this peace you know but Jesus wasn't worried about how long or the condition that was in even how far God heaven he said I just just roll the stone away put your hands short roll it away hallelujah hallelujah and then then only when the stone was rolled away it was them that did it then he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and we know because he's the resurrection the life brother Bram said if he didn't call him by name there would have been a general resurrection right but he called that to come forth he called Lazarus to come forth but Lazarus came out bound and his grave clothes was a napkin honest he had all those things and now jesus said to them loose him and let him go so now the disciples had to Mary and Martha had to actually put their faith into action and loosen and let it go let it have its way hallelujah you get the peace of God in your life don't just leave it bound up don't just put it on the shelf loose it let it take control of you Paulo you get faith in your life let fight have a perfect patience have a perfect work let faith rule well what do you mean by that well you're gonna let the would govern your life I mean so when the enemy comes in I've been reading about the life of Daniel his faith controlled him amen his faith in God controlled his walk controlled his life it wasn't what the politics of the day was doing it wasn't about the kingdom about those enemies were doing no his faith controlled him he he made up his mind I'm gonna pray towards the temple the temple wasn't even there is just a charred ruin but he just said I'm gonna pray to it cuz Solomon prayed said God if he prays towards this place you'll hear so and then the edict came out no one's allowed to pray for thirty days but to the king or whatever did he let that change his walk no cuz he let his faith was loosed it was now it wasn't bound up something is bound up you can actually just you know this is bound up it's controlled you take a dog put it on a collar put it you know put it in a cage it's bound it can't run it can't do like dog things it's stuck in that but when it's loosed then it runs and it chases and it does cause it's loose and now that dog you got to watch out now come here boy coming here now cuz they own it now that has rain but when you've got in a cage now you've got control it's probably very crude expression to to compare the Lord to a dog but you gotta let him be lord over your life you let him take preeminence let your faith your revelation of his word rule you you following me so Daniel wasn't swayed by what was going on around him he said I'm gonna pray anyway so happens as windows towards Jerusalem hey cries out jehova rapha jehova lord god almighty elohim el satya hallelujah I had talked to you today are they guys that Holy Roller again talking to his God he didn't care why cause his faith was loose and it was now living it was functioning in his life he wasn't he wasn't worried about anything else so that's what I mean by your joy let's come out of the tomb don't leave a bound loose it let it go oh but I'm you know I was thinking about the war reserved people are reserved one of the definitions of reserved as saved for later don't don't let your don't be reserved safe for later why not now you follow me I'm not reserved in that way you understand anyway but you know Daniel Daniel was Daniel was a man where he was living at a time and he was so moved by reading the scroll of Jeremiah there's in Daniel 9 and and he began to realize that the prophecy of Jeremiah was was was was now coming to its fulfillment because it would it was nearly 70 years since Jerusalem had been destroyed and God said in 70 years I will restore the people back so he was so moved by that he was reading the scriptures about his day and he was so moved by the fulfillment of the word in his day he began to seek and pray pray to the Lord and find you know Lord when is this going to happen hallelujah whoa what was happening his faith was loosed he wasn't just reading the scrolls of Jeremiah cuz all Jeremiah did a lot of things needs a vindicated prophet of God now he was reading it saying now Lord because he began to see himself in the book he beginning to see himself in the scroll when he was reading that prophecy he begin to realize I'm part of that prophecy because I'm living in the season of the fulfillment hallelujah so now he began to seek God God when is this going to happen because he knew that he was part of that prophecy I mean so now his faith was loosed it wasn't behind a tombstone of Conformity or anything of oh yo formalism and so he was seeking God until God gave him the the answer that when it was going to happen and it's friends it's got to be the same thing with us you got to see yourself in this you got to see yourself in the word just like you can see Jesus Christ in every scripture you should see yourself I mean because just as he is the word we are part of his word because we're part of him right so the Bible's got to be more than a storybook it's got to be a love letter to your personal and the only way it can be a love letter is when you fall in love with the author I'm not talking about the human authors they pinned it down talking about the one that spoke through them the Lord Jesus Christ himself so he began to pray and seek God and he begin to you know see where these things would happen and the Lord came gabriel think was seen to him and began to give him understanding but now and then but then Daniel was Daniel was told win because he because he's not just shown that time be shown to the time of the end and then he begins to seek God and say witness is going to happen and then Daniel 12 is going to read from verse 1 says at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people we're going to come back to the tomb by the way if you wonder I'm just I'm just going to go around this way the Great Prince which standeth up for thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even at the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that has found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they shall turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased so Daniel because his faith was loosed it was loosed it wasn't hidden away he got an answer when's these things going to be but then II but then when the Lord comes to this part of the part of the fulfillment he sees no the books got to be sealed up because it's not the time but but we can see from reading this that you know his people shall be delivered every one that has found written in the book so God has a book in heaven we know that he's got the book of life in the Lamb's Book of Life we know the book of life records our earthly earthly walk so what we did in our flesh that's why in the Old Testament you read all the failures and the faults of the believers down through wow that's like the book of life but then now when the blood of the lamb has shed you read now what God's God's biography of those people were so we take Abraham Abraham back slidden he went down to Guerrero into another place and he says to Sarah Sarah you're a beautiful woman you know they'll kill me if they find out we're married and they want to marry you so would you say that you're my sister and he she caught it was because they were half brother and sister so now yeah so so all those fatties were there you know there was there was David with Bathsheba all these all these families of the believers were recorded away because that was their natural life being recorded right and it's like as we come to an age of accountability the book of life begins to write amen but there comes a point just like when you read about Abraham in the New Testament when the Apostle Paul's writing the Divine Comedy rivers life he doesn't pick up those failures he doesn't pick up the time where where Abraham laughed in the presence of God have you ever read that God comes down to Abraham says you're gonna be a father of Nations and he literally falls at the feet of God and laughs in his face it wasn't just Sarah that laughed he laughed too but when the Apostle Paul began to write about Abraham he said he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith believe you're believing persuaded that he would do that he is promised why is that because now the blood of the Lamb was come hallelujah that actually washed away all of their natural walk and God only recorded their faith walk it's the same thing with us now that's the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah so now here we are in this day we come to an age of accountability the book of life begins to write but when God takes your book and he washes it in the blood of Jesus Christ I mean all those things that remembered it's not in his records no more it's been all washed away hallelujah hallelujah CC is now that all those that are written in the book shall be delivered so what he's saying is that everyone that's in the Lamb's Book of Life they're gonna come a time where they are delivered and that's why I want to say that's why you can look back at what you were and what you are now is what what was not what you were you have something's happened to you and it's not just a conformity but we you can say one time God meant you change your nature change your desires change how you were trains change your appetite what you used to love you cannot stand and what you used to hate you love hallelujah I would never have come into a place like this to be honest I would never have come to this you can invited me every day every day I would never have come but one day God came holy us listen to the message of one day God came and he washed my book wholly washed my life Holly and those things aren't attributed to me no more it's been washed and when someone's washed in the blood of lamb their wash how are their change you can see there's a difference in their life it's not them trying to be a Christian God comes into them and he's a Christian out of them hallelujah I mention is going to be a full deliverance for the people and we're living in that yo I just love you know that's like when you when you look outside it's sunny and you hear the weather report it's sunny he just rejoices I want something I already know but it's good it's just a confirmation of what you're experiencing right it's the same thing when you look into the word for yourself when you see the Liberty you have I mean see walk them lamb has done see what God has done for us we just rejoice hallelujah well it makes me happy anyway so doubt hallelujah so and then he says that they will and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they shall turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever now we know stars are in a position when God said Let there be Sun Moon and stars he knew where all the stars would be in the constellations they are orbiting all in the same way you know there's a there's a pattern that's why they can predict when there'll be a Blood Moon will there be eclipses whatever and they can be exactly accurate because the heavens keep turning as God has ordained them but we know shooting stars are just chaos running through the galaxy it's still a star but it's a falling star it's a shooting star it's not in its possession but he's saying now that we knows that many shall turn to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever what he's saying is those that God has has your turn to righteousness they'll be like a star in heaven they'll be in their position in the body of Christ just like the moon is there God said moon you're gonna be there Mars is going to be there they're in their possession and so God God turned to righteousness and they taxes and places and the body where we're meant to be hallelujah and actually quite often it's actually us come to the realization this is what we're always worming to be hey man that's why the body begins to function why everyone comes to their position and God can manifest himself in a far greater way in a body of people than just one hallelujah and that's we know we're living in the time of a body work now Mary Martha had to roll the stone away why do you talk about Daniel because there should be something in us god what have you given me we read about an inheritance hallelujah it's a great inheritance that's a great you know you think of what we have even just eternal life is incredible hallelujah isn't it gonna be wonderful there'll be a time where I shall still be and there won't be time will be eternity I'll still be there I'll still be here hallelujah but now it begins a but but he wants us to know our position in him what he's given us and he wants us to know that because now we can actually go possess it hallelujah just like the promised land Israel came out of Egypt you know but in the spies were sent out they had to actually give a description off the land so now what it did to the believers are you're of that generation it gave them expectation wow this really else has it really flowing with milk and honey other grape you know it was actually God was actually showing them this is what you're gonna go possess and I've already given it to you be it's gonna go possess it just go walk up and take it hallelujah surely be battles but you've already won you just got to go forward and take it hey mints that's the same thing with you and I God's given us all things in him hallelujah and to think we're living in an age where you know we're not just cool just a plateau in our walk which is it granted the fullness of God hallelujah you know we're living in that age so what yo to me I think what we should do is say well what's mine have you made a list of what I don't have a list right now but you should go go through the scripture and say what does God given me you're probably writing our vision of this whole book but that's good I'm glad it's not just what but you should go look what is mine and it's not about well do I have it right now no what is mine just like taalib whinnies in Egypt he had a resurrection mountain in the promised land it was his his name was on it but he was in Egypt but he said no I've heard a voice God seemed to vindicate a prophet gods come down in this day to take me from Egypt as a slave to be now in my position in the land see you said let's go take it hallelujah he didn't have it he didn't have a speck of that mountain but something I don't see it it's mine I want it and she'll be the same thing with you and I what does God give it doesn't matter what condition you think you're in right now what's mine hallelujah and then you find out what y'all you say Lord give it to me hallelujah guess that's gotta be be good roll the stone away hallelujah welcome to be a stone of a stone of pride a stone of selfishness as you know a stone of feeling sorry for yourself just looking at your state that you're in you know through much tribulation do we enter the kingdom of God that's what the scripture through much tribulation through much trouble it's going to happen we can't escape it so you must accept it we're gonna have trouble sure we're gonna have trouble it's gonna be worth it all hallelujah when we stand around the throne hallelujah and we place our crowns at his feet and we crown of king of kings and Lord of lords there will be no regret there'll be no even the darkest darkest part of your life you will not be regret being in that place police say Lord it was worth it going through that it was worth being that way even Legion will say it was worth being in the tombs it was worth it was worth being stuck there because you brought me out hallelujah it'll be worth it amen so you know we shouldn't let's not feel sorry for ourselves God's given us the ability a mint to walk through the trial and to overcome the trial hallelujah Amen but you got a wrong selfishness pride indifference roll it away resentment roll it away God's never done anything bad to anyone I mean God wants to show something to you in the trial holy just like brother Tim Dodson when his wife died years ago he said God show me what I should know he said Lord teach me what you want to teach me in this trial because I may never walk through this trial again that's why it should be even in a small thing Lord what are you wanting to show me because he wanted to show something about himself and something about you hallelujah and so and about how the devil works so next time it comes along well you just Chris through it hallelujah Amen yes like the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness he didn't just leave him here he came back after a season came to trouble him stirred up the people whatever it was but because he was the word he didn't let he didn't let those things disrupt his walk it was loosed hey God was loosed his faith was loosed nothing of Jesus was behind it - on his earthly journey follow me so nothing nothing that nothing the devil could do it could affect his walk and his walk was fulfilling the Word of God for his life he knew for this cause to be the Lamb of God for this cause I've come into the world to be a sacrifice redemption for many how they are so because he knew what he knew what he had to fulfill he could walk the way he walked how about you do you know why you're here well I live here because of this or this job well this has brought me here my family's here no but what about you there may be all part of it but this you know my job is not the reason I'm here amen you know this is why we're here we're here to fulfill our Scripture you were to see what part of the word you hear to fulfill and I can tell you I mean by the authority of God's Word it's not to go into a lake of fire I managed to take a rapture I need to take a body change of translation of the Living Saints with the dead hallelujah that's what we're here to fulfill amen but you got to roll the stone away don't leave that stone there between you and the promise you gotta roll it hallelujah just like Jesus when he began to ask his disciples you know who do men say that I am and they say well some say you're Jeremiah Sorel I saw you know one of the prophets but said but who do you say that I am and the Apostle Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said blessed art thou simon barjona son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven has revealed us to you so no man told you this you didn't work this out on your own accord God gave it sovereignly to you there's now upon this rock what is that the revelation of who Jesus Christ is I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against now we know a gate I've probably said this many times a gate is stopping access to something that's what a gate is so he's telling those people who were who are who are built upon the rock of the revelation of who Jesus Christ is the gates of Hell will not prevail against them so there's no gate that can stop you there's no work of the devil there's no tombstone there's nothing that can stop the believer but it's your choice if you go through or not it's not the devil that stops us it's actually ourselves stop us possessing every promise he tries to stop us but who's greater Satan was thoroughly defeated that day of Calvary he doesn't have the keys to his own house he was stripped of every power he's nothing but a bluff he surelly defeated he's defeated he's still defeated today so who's the one that we've got a defeat this guy if I can get this guy out of the way what if Mary Martha said no I'm not going to go see Jesus I'm going to stay in the house with my comforters Lazarus would have stayed did the promise is there you've got to possess it it's up to you they had a choice you've got to make a choice make up your mind no don't be double-minded is this right is it really what it cracked that ball to be or is the world right are my friends right are those whispering in my ear right what's right you've got to know what's right God's right amen I thought you know I probably said before they gave me brother convinced in a while ago you know all the parents he said stand up he said now you children if the world is so great why are we here you know why don't we stand our drugs and our parties and our movies our music in the world and the bars and the pubs and the making homebrew whatever it was why didn't we stay there for so awesome because it's not awesome this is this living is awesome so you know so be gonna make up your mind but the thing is you have to make up your mind it's not your parents car I can't make up my girls minds as much I'd love to just pour it into them God's alive and he is alive yeah but I can't give them the experience they have to come to their own choice Here I am Lord Lord Jesus that that God you that my mummy and daddy tell me about come meet me holy I want to know you the same way and he will meet me in the same way if they come at the right heart with the right motive some people say Oh Lord if you're real reveal yourself but in their hearts they don't want to know and there's all God's not really didn't charms up was cuz in their hearts they weren't actually willing to meet him amen but you know we've got to we have to see what the word is for us to fulfill you look into the scripture say Lord why don't why am I here hallelujah now he sees certain he sees in 1st John 5 he says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God every one that loveth him they beget loveth him also that is begotten of him but this we know that we love the that we love the children of God when we love and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God now when we talk about faith the Bible says in James turn nineteen now believe if there is one God thou do us well the devils also believe in tremble so the Devils have a have some kind of faith but they faith that John is speaking about is not the same faith as the Devils because if the devil's believe if they had the same faith to believer had that be saved right but the Devils can't be saved right but they believe that he is you know but they believe there's one God they tremble so they have a faith but it's not the faith we have right because the faith we have is God revealing himself to us make himself known we into into a relationship with him but he says that this is the now I didn't mention this last week but I just want to plow it in a book he says this is and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now that word victory it means in the Greek it means a conquest it means the means of success so so the means of our success to overcome the world is our faith hallelujah so the revelation of who he is and who we are in him causes us to overcome hallelujah it actually causes us to overcome you know and that's why you can look at your life like Mary Martha they had revelation faith right they didn't believe like the Jews belief they believed he was the Christ and they had faith to roll the stone away right that's what caused him to overcome to receive one that was dead back to life again they had Revelation faith to overcome that tombstone that yo that that stone was man-made it was cut by man's handle was shaped it was a man-made blockage to keep something to come back to them that they had lost hallelujah so but they had they had faith the means of the victory to get Lazarus back from the dead they had it to roll the stone away now how about you if we're to overcome remember he's the overcomer in us brother Brahim says he is the overcoming he's our overcomer but if we're to overcome we have to go through some battles an invincible army is not yo your brother MC it the bride when she recognizes who she is and to actually identify the antichrist spirit working within her mix in to discern and with standard she shall be an invincible army and vincible army isn't just a bunch of raw recruits that have come out of the training and they're marching up and down the parade square and their gear that's not invincible army and because they've never been tested in battle sure they can pass the training but then you got to go into the field where it's not not just set up theater to work out how to use your weapons and work as a unit now you've got to face something that wants to destroy you on the battlefield and so it's only those that have really an invincible army has to go through a campaign has to go through a battle has to be tried by every spirit has to have trouble coming to stress different spirits come in and try to upset their walk and their victory you know this is what we have to overcome so an invincible army will go through a few campaigns hallelujah but you've got to be very careful that the scars that you receive from the battles don't become stones that roll in front of what you've lost you got to be very careful that they experiences you know people they receive you're like I think I said about my my my great uncle he fought in World War two you know he he woke up screaming virtually to the day he died because of the trauma he experienced in the battle he survived the war he was alive you know but but the scars he carried emotionally bothered him to the day he died you know he was never a believer that I know of he's a great man but you know we got to be careful we can't let trauma because you know when the devil comes in but didn't you see God come down and deliver do incredible things you know mind battles and he delivered God delivers of mine bells trouble comes in and you don't know Lord how's this gonna work out you see things are falling apart it's um how God does grace brings us back together brings healing and restoration and you rejoice in the victory but be careful that the scars the memory of it doesn't become like a tombstone hallelujah you got to be very careful cuz sure it's always every battle is good in this bed I don't know one veteran of or any war that just came through unscathed either physical wounding or emotional trauma so there's always you know we're gonna carry some trophies hallelujah when we go up into heaven remember hey there's the reason the Lord has to come and wipe away all tears from our eyes don't cry no more children it's all over right because we'll be carrying something up there that we experienced here but he's going to wipe that from us hallelujah so there's going to be and all we're going to remember is the good right but we're gonna take some bad you know some some trouble if I can put maybe I'm hope this comes out right but there's gonna be things he's gonna have to wipe from our memories that we won't cry no more you with us right but we've got to be careful don't let bad things be a tombstone and don't justify it being there Mary and Martha justified they said but he stinker that's been four days it should that he needs to be sealed in there don't justify a negative thought pattern don't justify a pity party don't justify well this person to listen this person to that and therefore I have legal right to feel this way against this person they may have done all those things but Jesus forgave you you should be able to forgive anyone Amen if we were enemies of God but yet he loved us and died for us and washed us and cleanse us I mean we're aliens from him we weren't even in the Commonwealth of Israel even in the promise of God but yet he died for us hallelujah and a fever if he can forgive me the poor wretched sinner that I was and wash it away and and he never holds it against me he never comes me say you remember what you used to do you remember that no no he doesn't remind me of that he says come come apart y'all there's more whew let's go rejoice this guy over victory hallelujah let's go fight this battle take this land take this part of my word holier push the devil off your ground hallelujah he said come on let's go let's go never reminds me what I once did we should be and if we have the mind of Christ who's got the mind of Christ today then you will think about other people to say where he thinks about you irrespective of what they've done hallelujah my hallelujah now I might just I might just read this and then oh then I'll close VCS going back to the lens book of life he says but thank every one of you in here today is got your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you never put it there and your preacher never put it there neither your church put it there but God put it there and when did God do it it's written in the lap blood of the Lamb how many believes that there isn't enough ink remover or whatever it is in the world to get it out there look God put your name on the book of life at the foundation of the world and the Bible said we're just nothing we never had nothing to do with it I never had nothing to do with it God Himself did it at the foundation of the world when he slew the lamb by foreknowledge he knew that Christ would be here and he was called the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world and the Beast will deceive all that dwells dwells upon the earth whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life on the foundation of the world he's I wish you Pentecostal people could see that that's the one thing you shorten that's what brings fear and trouble to you oh you say brother am I'm afraid we'll go off on the deep end of eternal security in all this oh no you don't have to worry about it if you keep your heart in the Bible he says at won't see it's the Word of God we're to just get rid of all the fear what if I fail cuz we love him so we don't want to displease him just like any relationship you don't want to hurt your spouse or your children because you love them you don't want you don't want to disappoint them you don't want to you know put them in any way because you love them just like us it actually builds a tension in the believers life because we want to walk with God and we want to walk in a way that's pleasing to him right but don't let the devil ever push you off on the deep end that you're afraid to do anything because y'all but what if God's not displeased no as long as your hearts in the Bible as long as your hearts and him he will guide you it will guide you through how Lou yeah you know some people they say well if I'm there I'm there if I'm not I'm not I say that's just unbelieving I say if I'm there I'm there and I'm coming anyway probably although the father has given me will come and you look country or no wise cast out so here I am Lord Here I am let me in let me in holy that's how I just be you know I would never sit back and say well if I'm there I'm there if I'm not no God is a gentleman he's given invitation to all you want to come marry me come be part of the bride be part of my word hallelujah you make up your bones so Mary Martha had to roll the stone away you gotta roll the stone away if you have left your first love something came in and now it's all as this writer than this ride and does this work as this putt user so you know people get so caught up you know we have an order but if you're so worried like I'll put it for example you know talk about sound equipment because I've researched it so much and there and and like when I first met the Lord I never thought about buildings and architecture and size of rooms and sound and never thought about that stuff I just love the Lord who cares about the but it of course is the church you think about sound and you think the so you gone to a place what's your mind on this is me let speakers there are you to wear anywhere and your mind is all this and God's moving in his power in the service and you're looking at speakers how ridiculous this is me this is me and I comes to a place you're gonna get next to yourself who cares about that when God is present put kids about is this all the color of this or this or this or this don't worry about that we can talk about that later but right now God has him fully and this hat should me listen to me I'm here to worship God not sound equipment hallelujah we can have the perfect building perfect acoustics perfect everything but if God is not there forget it holy I'd rather be in a place like this where God is our then anywhere else in the world lujah you say but what what cause that there's a stone the devil took something from me because I got caught up in what I saw I have to roll it away I had to roll that stone away and God said God and it got cold first love come back come off hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what and something that our head was now restored to me and it doesn't matter if it's works that works who cares what works we can have a power cut we can have a rapture hallelujah who cares about that stuff hallelujah glory to God but I had to make a choice am I gonna let this eat me for no reason or am I just gonna have a good time am I just gonna worship the God of my salvation and you can take that in any aspect of your life oh this is wrong what about what's right the devil never says that's right in that's right and yet you've overcome and yeah I have no part in you and you have no part in me and you're gonna take a rapture and I'm gonna burn in a lake of fire and you're gonna win and you're gonna be on streets of gold I'm not going to be there I'm cast down and he never goes that knows he's not that's wrong in that's wrong and that's wrong and what about this and oh yeah forget him forget him forget him he's not going to be when the lamb takes the book and revelations five the devil's not there the kids with the brethren is cast down that speak of when the bride has fully redeemed around the throne there'll be no devil there and I'll get to the end of this book and he gets off into the lake of fire I keep going on this he goes exit stage left in the lake of fire I agree exit stage right up into glory hallelujah that's my end that's his end so why don't we just look at our end worried but you say well that's just a nice idea it's not a nice idea because the Spirit of God we feel among us it's declaring there's a future home to go to I mean the very reason that God has moved on your life and transformed you because you have an eternal body to go into nothing your one day will d be there it's there already and it's calling you I mean that's a step in - that's theophany that's why God speaks you the way he does this is God as telling you have an eternal home you have a place to step into it's not just a nice idea here hallelujah so don't look at maybe I'm just too narrow-minded but I've got a heaven to go I've got a king to see I've got a God to rejoice I got him to worship I like him to stand before and say Lord you brought me here I didn't bring myself here you got me here Lord you cleanse me you wash me you save me you're a demon you kept me on the narrow way when I couldn't find the way you kept me on the way hallelujah you defeated the devil every place every place I went you conquered every foe for me you're the one who's overcome hallelujah do I deserve it no I don't deserve it but it's not about how you feel about you that's what he has declared about you that matters hallelujah if it's how we feel we'd never get there but don't worry about how you feel shall we fail them every day but there's a blood there's a lamb we have an intercessor working on our behalf we had an advocate which is Jesus Christ the righteous and he's standing there making intercession for you even right now hallelujah so what have we got to lose they say Lord will you really take me to that place why is he called you here that's why it's not when we get to heaven we'll shout the victory no we can shout it right here and the presence of the devil we can shout and rejoice and say Lord you've washed me you've saved me you're taking me all the way hallelujah we don't need to wait till then now because what you are now is what you will be this doesn't change you you're still the same person over there wholly aside say Lord take me you got to die whatever is holding you back push it away you know because the propers up yeah I've met people they started God begins to deal with them but when they talk about the world at a positive light or I can still do this oh I love being this they love their former identity what's happened their heart is not surrendered to God they're still apart I'm saying I loved being met but it's like the Apostle Paul you got to come to a place or I count all things but done done hallelujah here's a Pharisee the Pharisee holy man so coool be seen oh that's done what were you the Apostle Paul a Pharisee wow that would have been amazing all these great gamellia teaching you all these scrolls with that's done it was done hallelujah but God in His grace when he's been that's not done chriskiss Oh hallelujah you gotta roll the stone away just roll it away watch it roll and fall of the dirt hallelujah let's pray so stand shall we together hallelujah glory to God hallelujah my Lord Jesus gracious father we want to thank you lord thank you lord we can roll the stone away Lord's roll that resentment away that burden us away Lord that herd away that pain away Lord our passed away that pride away law that pity-party away feeling sorry for herself away we can roll it all away hallelujah oh we're gonna put our shoulders to it look just like Mary and Martha Lord they had to roll the stone away Lord that their brother would be restored to them and brought back to life and lots I was the devil Lord he tries to rob us of our joy our peace our love Lord our first love and you Lord our patients our faith out meekness our temperance dear God father the overcoming power of your life in a slaughter takes it tries to rob that promise but my god I'm so thankful Lord we can roll the stone away hallelujah will you push
