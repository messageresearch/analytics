[22:54] preaching now a testimony of uh yeah so
[22:57] because we've been here about 11 odd
[22:58] years now I think CU Lilia was a baby
[23:00] and yeah we moved downstairs now we're
[23:02] here but amen things move on you know
[23:06] sometimes you you don't expect uh the
[23:08] last time but then there's a last time
[23:10] and there'll be a last time of last time
[23:12] I'm not preaching about tonight but
[23:13] there'll be a last time of last times
[23:16] one last day Hallelujah then we'll be
[23:20] raptured amen that's what I'm getting to
[23:23] amen so let's go to Exodus chapter 17
[23:24] tonight and verses 14-6
[23:29] amen so you never know when your last
[23:31] time is but hey God knows all about
[23:35] it amen so let's uh let's just go to
[23:38] Exodus 17 and:
[23:40] 14-6 and um we'll just read this is so
[23:43] this is after Joshua has fought against
[23:46] the amalekites we know uh Moses was
[23:48] commanded to raise his hands up and his
[23:50] hands were raised they won the battle
[23:51] when his hands fell down they're losing
[23:53] so Aaron and her held up moses' hands
[23:56] and they won the victory so now after
[23:58] after this is all done says and the Lord
[24:00] said unto Moses write this for a
[24:02] memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[24:04] the ears of Joshua for I uly put out the
[24:07] remembrance of um amalec from under
[24:09] heaven and Moses built an altar and
[24:12] called uh called the name of it Jehovah
[24:14] Nissi for he said because the Lord hath
[24:16] sworn that the Lord will have war with
[24:19] amch from generation to
[24:21] generation amen so let's bow our heads
[24:24] in a word of prayer amen this night you
[24:25] want to be remembered in prayer say Lord
[24:27] remember me as as as you pass by our way
[24:30] amen let's pray gracious Lord our hearts
[24:32] desires to stay in your presence Lord we
[24:35] want more of you my God we don't want to
[24:37] just rest on yesterday's experience
[24:40] though we are thankful for all you've
[24:41] done in our past but Lord we want to
[24:43] press on the to the mark of the high
[24:44] calling in Christ Lord we want more of
[24:46] you father we just pray as we've read
[24:48] your great Eternal Word Lord that once
[24:50] again Lord you will come the great
[24:52] author and anoint your word to speaker
[24:53] and hearer Lord have your way in our
[24:55] midst father those who are streaming
[24:57] those who are not well Lord touch their
[24:58] lives as well father may we be attentive
[25:01] may we be alert and may you have
[25:02] preeminence Lord and may your blood
[25:04] cover us forgive us all our wrongs our
[25:06] sins Lord make us more like You Lord For
[25:08] Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen
[25:11] amen amen you can have your seats
[25:13] tonight so I want to just take a thought
[25:15] um from this how because I was I was
[25:18] very interested where I was reading this
[25:20] and and how the Lord told Moses to write
[25:23] this for a memorial in a book and this
[25:25] is actually the first time that it's
[25:28] ever recorded that something was written
[25:29] down in the Bible so so this is the
[25:32] first thing that that God actually tells
[25:34] Moses to write you know we know who
[25:36] wrote the first five books of the Bible
[25:37] but this is this is the first instance
[25:40] where something is written down for a
[25:42] memorial and it had to be rehearsed in
[25:44] the years of Joshua now to rehearse
[25:47] something is to repeat it it's to convey
[25:49] it it's to it's to relate it over and
[25:51] over again and and we know that uh uh
[25:54] that this what God has sworn that he
[25:56] will he will ultimately blot the name of
[25:59] the um of the amalekites um from from
[26:02] from he he he'll take the remembrance of
[26:04] um AMC from under Heaven that he's going
[26:06] to fight this war with the amalekites
[26:08] from generation to generation this this
[26:10] this had to be rehearsed this had to be
[26:12] repeated because the people had to
[26:14] realize that the God that was on their
[26:16] side was against their enemy now it's
[26:18] one thing you know we read the scripture
[26:20] in Romans chapter 8 that you know if God
[26:22] be for us who can be against us but if
[26:24] you take the flip side of that if God be
[26:26] against you who who can be for you
[26:29] right no one can be for you you can have
[26:30] the best everything but if God is
[26:32] against you you're going to lose okay
[26:34] now I'm not looking at those kind of
[26:35] people I'm looking at people who if God
[26:37] be for us who can be against us so now
[26:40] God would God would have the Lord write
[26:42] this down and he'd command that it would
[26:44] be rehearsed into the ears of Joshua now
[26:46] I find it interesting that it's not
[26:48] rehearsed into the ears of Moses but
[26:50] Joshua had to Joshua had to hear this
[26:53] and the reason is is that you know at
[26:55] this stage Joshua wasn't anointed to be
[26:57] the next leader after Moses but God and
[26:59] his mind knew that Joshua would take the
[27:01] people over into the land so so God knew
[27:04] that Joshua would need to know these
[27:06] words and it had to become very clear to
[27:08] him it had to be repeated to him not
[27:10] that it would become common but that it
[27:12] would become as alive and as fresh as
[27:14] when it first transpired amen so that's
[27:17] why when Peter would say he'd say in 2
[27:19] Peter 1 he says for so an entrance shall
[27:22] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[27:24] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[27:26] Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not
[27:28] be negligent to put you always always in
[27:31] remembrance of these things though you
[27:33] know them and be established in the
[27:35] present truth yay I think it meat as
[27:38] long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir
[27:40] you up by putting you in remembrance I
[27:43] mean so so Peter had the same kind of
[27:45] Burden I'm going to repeat some things
[27:47] amen I'm going to stir up your
[27:48] remembrance amen that these things don't
[27:50] become common they don't become a
[27:52] distant memory but they become alive and
[27:54] fresh just as alive and fresh as when it
[27:57] was first first instructed now Joshua
[28:00] was going to take the people into the
[28:02] land you know there was going to be a
[28:03] time of transition where where Moses
[28:05] would go off the scene and Joshua would
[28:07] become the leader of the Israelites and
[28:10] so we we are living in a time of
[28:13] transition ourselves we are moving from
[28:15] this building to another building we're
[28:17] going into a different season you know
[28:19] we are going to another church that's
[28:20] bigger because we need to make room for
[28:22] prodal we need to make room for God's
[28:25] children amen we need to make room for
[28:27] more it's not just us for no more amen
[28:29] we're not the Frozen chosen amen we're
[28:31] here you know to be a lighthouse that of
[28:33] you know that that there's room at the
[28:34] End Amen that people can come and meet
[28:36] the Lord like we all have amen but so
[28:39] we're living in this time of of
[28:41] transition but during this time of
[28:43] transition we got to realize that that
[28:45] our God that fought the enemy in the
[28:48] previous generation is going to fight
[28:50] that same enemy in the Next Generation
[28:52] now when we're talking about the
[28:53] amalekites here we know we don't fight
[28:55] against flesh and blood but we fight
[28:57] against spirit spiritual wickedness in
[28:59] high places we fight against demonic
[29:00] anointings and but so God when he was to
[29:02] me when he was speaking of the
[29:04] amalekites now he was speaking of what
[29:07] he was going to do to the devil and his
[29:09] angels that he was going to fight
[29:11] against him from generation to
[29:12] generation amen that it wasn't just
[29:14] going to be like in Revelations 12 that
[29:17] Michael and his angels fought against
[29:19] the dragon and his angels and he
[29:21] prevailed not was cast down now that's
[29:22] the end of it no Our God pursued his
[29:24] enemy upon the Earth right he's been
[29:26] pursuing him down through down through
[29:29] since the beginning of time since the
[29:30] war started amen he's been pursuing his
[29:33] enemy fighting his enemy and he's not
[29:34] going to stop until that enemy is in the
[29:36] Lake of Fire hallelujah our god is
[29:41] persistent amen so so the so our lord
[29:44] Jesus is going to blot the name of Satan
[29:47] from out from not just under heaven but
[29:49] in heaven his name is going to be no
[29:51] more because his life is going to be no
[29:53] more there's no such thing as an eternal
[29:55] hell it comes to an end all the devil
[29:58] and his angels whoever ends up there is
[30:00] going to cease to be then then they're
[30:02] not going to be in um existence no place
[30:05] right so God is saying that he's going
[30:07] to absolutely annihilate his enemy and
[30:10] do away with him but friends when he is
[30:12] no more we shall still be amen we'll be
[30:15] dancing on streets of gold because we're
[30:16] are Eternal right brother ramam says if
[30:18] you ever have eternal life you you
[30:20] always had eternal life because Eternal
[30:22] had no beginning and had no end you just
[30:25] recognized that when you received the
[30:26] word of your day
[30:28] amen that seed came to life and you
[30:30] realized who your papa is which is God
[30:33] Amen so praise the Lord so if God before
[30:36] us who can be against us
[30:38] now we know that that that our our
[30:42] nature was the enemy of God but then God
[30:45] so loved the world he gave his only
[30:47] begotten son right so whosoever
[30:48] believeth him shall not perish but have
[30:50] eternal life so when we were his enemy
[30:52] he died for us amen that his that that
[30:55] his life would come into us change your
[30:58] nature to be like his nature and that
[31:00] his atoning blood would cause us to
[31:02] become one with him and we' be in
[31:04] perfect Oneness with him he changes our
[31:06] nature to do that amen so now he
[31:10] so he's going to use now now I'm sorry
[31:13] if I'm jumping around a lot but I'm just
[31:14] wanting to lay a bit of a foundation
[31:16] because every generation God's going to
[31:17] fight this battle who's he going to
[31:19] fight it
[31:20] through through human beings this this
[31:24] this battle was Angelic Warfare then it
[31:27] came into to human beings right and now
[31:30] God is going to anoint his sons and
[31:32] daughters in every generation to defeat
[31:34] his enemy amen that's where he's going
[31:37] to that's where he's going to win the
[31:38] battle is in human beings amen just like
[31:41] the Lamb of God our lord Jesus what did
[31:44] he do he became flesh to take on human
[31:46] battles am mean to fight this war
[31:49] because when God said I'm going to fight
[31:51] this war from generation to Generation
[31:53] Well then there had to be a generation a
[31:55] Believers in every generation to fight
[31:57] and win this battle coming out packing
[31:59] the victory amen so this battle now it
[32:02] shifts As Time shifts it's still God and
[32:06] Satan fighting but the conditions of the
[32:09] a ages change right people don't change
[32:11] but you know we live in a different age
[32:13] than there was 2,000 years ago we're
[32:15] living in the seventh Church age we're
[32:17] living in a different time right but so
[32:20] it so the battle moves from generation
[32:21] to generation and God would prophesy
[32:25] what how the Warfare was going to be
[32:26] done he would anoint Isaiah and said
[32:29] there' be a voice of one crying in the
[32:30] wilderness right in Isaiah 40:3 to
[32:34] prepare the way of the Lord he would say
[32:35] in Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a son is
[32:38] given unto us a child is given his name
[32:39] Shall be Called Mighty the Everlasting
[32:41] father you know the Prince of Peace
[32:43] right so prophesying of the Lord Jesus
[32:45] to come and so now but then also he
[32:49] would he would prophesy of an end time
[32:52] people that would be the final voice to
[32:54] the final age cuz this battle's got to
[32:56] end right it's not just going to
[32:58] continue on and time's going to go on
[33:00] just like us being in this building we
[33:02] weren't going to be here
[33:04] forever right and now the time has come
[33:06] it's it's over well you Sunday but you
[33:09] know what I mean like we've come to our
[33:11] end maybe we didn't expect it but now
[33:12] it's say it's like you know when you're
[33:14] planning for a wedding you know the
[33:16] wedding's coming sometimes it can see
[33:18] seem very far away but then the day
[33:21] comes and you're in the dress and you're
[33:24] there or you're standing you're waiting
[33:25] for it to come in but it's like you've
[33:27] been waiting so long and then finally
[33:28] it's like this rapid change of events
[33:30] and things everything comes into place
[33:32] and you know maybe you thought months
[33:34] before how's this ever going to happen
[33:35] where is it going to happen what's going
[33:36] to who's going to come and all these
[33:38] things and then the guests come and the
[33:39] your invitations go out the food is all
[33:41] pln everything begins all the planning
[33:43] sits in and then you just see it it's
[33:44] like where did that day go but it seemed
[33:48] see and it's like the Scripture it seems
[33:49] like it's been a very long time
[33:51] thousands of years sometimes scripture
[33:52] has been sitting there seemingly dormant
[33:55] brother B said it's been circling the
[33:57] earth waiting for its season of
[33:59] fulfillment remember Malachi when he
[34:01] prophesied in Malachi 4 behold I send
[34:03] you Elijah the prophet that was 400
[34:05] years before John the Baptist or any
[34:08] what we call the New Testament era and
[34:10] it's been circling the earth for a long
[34:12] time but then when the age came right
[34:15] when the battlefield came to God's what
[34:18] God saw in his mind would come in the
[34:19] earth he say now is the season and
[34:22] there's a rapid change of things have
[34:24] happened as even as Daniel would say
[34:26] when he was wondering when you know he
[34:28] saw the Visions you know the symbolic uh
[34:30] you know the prophecy the end time and
[34:31] everything and he and and he asked God
[34:33] God when are these things going to
[34:34] happen and and and and God says go th
[34:37] Way Daniel for the book is sealed to the
[34:39] time of the end many shall run to and
[34:41] from knowledge shall increase and see if
[34:43] you look at technology it's like hasn't
[34:45] really ramped up much malachit and he
[34:48] did not fully obey the uh the word that
[34:51] God gave even saved the king alive
[34:53] Samuel had to kill King AAG and you know
[34:55] the those things that transpired
[34:58] and then you know it's amazing when when
[35:01] when God moves with a season he makes
[35:03] sure that if there's any failures in the
[35:05] previous season they're done away with
[35:08] because the because God doesn't want the
[35:10] devil to have anything to hang over your
[35:12] head you take the you know you take the
[35:15] sons of Kora for example it says in the
[35:17] book of numbers that they did not die
[35:19] with their father Kora so when K and
[35:22] Dayan gathered the princes of Israel and
[35:24] they they went to withstand Moses kora's
[35:26] Sons weren't with him
[35:28] so when the earth swallowed up Cor and
[35:29] day and all and everyone that gathered
[35:31] they didn't gather but yet they would
[35:33] have had a stigma attached with their
[35:35] name oh you're the son of Kora we all
[35:38] know what Kora did and there would have
[35:40] been even though they didn't do it there
[35:42] would be a stigma attached with their
[35:44] name now because of what their forebear
[35:45] did but God would God would cause it
[35:48] that they would not always live under
[35:49] that because God inspired David to
[35:52] gather the sons of Kora because they
[35:54] were going to be gathered to the temple
[35:55] am me to to to be anointed
[35:58] you know with the inspiration that God
[36:00] gave David he gave it th you know those
[36:02] songs he gave to the sons of Kor how
[36:04] many have read the Psalms to the sons of
[36:06] Kora right and then so he caused the
[36:08] sons of Kor to be anointed to sing those
[36:11] songs Under inspiration to show that the
[36:14] stigma of what their forbear did did not
[36:16] disqualify them I mean from being part
[36:18] of the worship of God you even look at
[36:21] um Esther in the Bible we know the Book
[36:23] of Esther you know Esther was from The
[36:25] Tribe of Benjamin Mor was from from Kish
[36:29] where Saul came from so that so that so
[36:32] that incomplete victory that that their
[36:34] forbear had God was going to say I'm
[36:36] going to cut that off and God would use
[36:38] people from that same line that same
[36:40] tribe am mean to stand in a foreign land
[36:43] a morai didn't bow he obviously purposed
[36:45] in his heart I'm not going to serve God
[36:47] incompletely I'm going to serve him
[36:49] completely I'm not going to do like my
[36:51] forbid did right and God made him that
[36:53] way because God wanted to cut that thing
[36:56] off their family line that it wouldn't
[36:58] be over them anymore and then Esther we
[37:00] know that she just said well if I perish
[37:02] I perish and she went in before the king
[37:03] we know these things but God used them
[37:07] to wipe that from what you know to
[37:10] because the because the battle came down
[37:11] to a Next Generation so the incomplete
[37:14] victory of a previous generation was not
[37:16] undone in the Next Generation you can
[37:19] see that with Martin Luther you know
[37:20] we're having you know uh Halloween is
[37:24] actually the same day that the
[37:25] Reformation officially started it's
[37:27] Reformation day so we can celebrate too
[37:30] if you want chocolate go for it but you
[37:31] know we can celebrate too because it was
[37:34] the day that Martin Luther took us 91
[37:35] thesis and nailed it to the CH uh Church
[37:38] door so it's Reformation day so the
[37:41] devil's got nothing on it's not
[37:43] Halloween to me it's happy Reformation
[37:44] day everyone that's when the bride
[37:46] started to be cut loose from
[37:48] denomination but you see now as as they
[37:50] were coming out of of the Catholic
[37:53] Church there was a lot of things hanging
[37:55] on them they did not completely ES ese
[37:58] but God but but God was fighting a war
[38:00] from generation to generation bringing
[38:02] his bride out bringing Victory but it
[38:03] was not a complete Victory right but
[38:05] then under the message of Malachi 4 amen
[38:08] God has inspired his word to cut off
[38:11] every man-made Dogma everything that the
[38:14] devil can hold against the church has
[38:15] been struck off I mean because this is
[38:18] the season of complete Victory I mean
[38:21] this is the season where where the devil
[38:23] is completely under the feet of the
[38:24] Bride of Jesus Christ amen cuz God said
[38:27] he's going to fight this battle from
[38:28] generation to generation amen remember
[38:30] the the battle is not ours the battle is
[38:33] the Lord's amen he said but he's got to
[38:35] find willing vessels to fight this
[38:37] battle
[38:38] through amen that is that is you and I
[38:42] but you see it's so vital amen because
[38:45] because this is a because this Warfare
[38:47] continues from generation to generation
[38:50] amen it it is absolutely vital that
[38:52] every generation has its own Revival I
[38:56] mean every generation has the word live
[38:58] in their lives that it's not just saying
[39:00] well you know it's all very good to
[39:02] share brother braham's stories of what
[39:04] God did in his life which is important
[39:06] to share but that's his testimony what
[39:08] about our testimony what about Jesus
[39:10] Christ the same yesterday today forever
[39:12] in
[39:13] 20124 what about him living today that's
[39:15] why every generation must have its own
[39:18] Revival amen his own chance at the word
[39:20] brother Bram said because that's the
[39:22] only way we can win this battle is with
[39:25] the spirit of Revival with God living in
[39:27] our midst with us with a complete
[39:29] selling out to the word of God and
[39:31] letting him live amen that's the only
[39:33] way we can win this battle amen and God
[39:35] has inspired us to win this battle I me
[39:38] remember we're anointed to win we're not
[39:39] anointed to lose we're not anointed to
[39:41] lose we're anointed to win amen but
[39:44] we're living in a Time amen where I
[39:46] believe we're the last
[39:48] generation when brother Bram said that
[39:50] there'll be young men that will take
[39:51] this message to the coming of the
[39:54] Lord I believe we're here
[39:58] what about our children do we plan for
[40:00] them absolutely cuz I'm wrong I don't
[40:02] mind being wrong but so we you know we
[40:04] want to we want to live like it's now
[40:06] but then live like it's 100 years
[40:08] time amen we want to prepare the Next
[40:11] Generation because they are the Church
[40:13] of
[40:15] today
[40:17] amen most of the band was under
[40:23] 30 even on a full band time well that's
[40:27] the that's the what what some people say
[40:29] is the Church of tomorrow no it's the
[40:30] Church of
[40:31] today amen and that's what we had to
[40:34] prepare for right that the Next
[40:35] Generation amen will rise up take their
[40:38] position in the word of God Amen that
[40:40] that they will have their own Revival
[40:42] why do we have camp that every
[40:44] generation will have its own Revival why
[40:46] do we have church that every generation
[40:48] will have its own Revival amen that they
[40:50] will see the Living God for themselves
[40:54] hallelujah amen amen so these things
[40:58] have to be rehearsed we got to realize
[40:59] that if God before us who can be against
[41:01] us this is I know I um you I spoken
[41:03] before in Romans chapter 8 but you know
[41:05] he would say Paul would say and we know
[41:07] that all things work together for good
[41:09] to them that love God to them who are
[41:11] called according to his purpose for whom
[41:13] he did for know he also did predestinate
[41:16] to be conformed to the image of his son
[41:18] that he might be the firstborn among
[41:20] many Brethren morover whom he did
[41:22] predestinate them he also called and
[41:24] whom he called them he also Justified
[41:26] and whom he ified them he also glorified
[41:29] what shall we say what shall we then say
[41:31] to these things if God be us who can be
[41:35] against us amen so if he's already
[41:37] called Justified and
[41:40] glorified in God's mind it's already
[41:43] done amen so so so then the Apostle Paul
[41:48] now he says now what can we say to these
[41:50] things then if God in his mind sees a
[41:53] called Justified glorified bride
[41:58] then if God before us who can be against
[42:00] us see we're not called just haphazardly
[42:02] we're not here just haphazardly amen we
[42:05] are here for a purpose God called us
[42:08] because he knew we would receive his
[42:09] word amen God God released this message
[42:12] to the Earth but when he when he had the
[42:15] prophet speak it he had you on his
[42:17] mind that you would receive it and it
[42:20] would live in your life amen so if we
[42:23] have God for us then it doesn't matter
[42:25] what the devil hatches against us it
[42:27] will not Prosper remember no weapon
[42:29] formed against us shall prosper there
[42:31] may be a lot of spirits in this day but
[42:34] we don't have to fear none of them that
[42:36] doesn't mean we just LAX and loose and
[42:37] whatever more no but we're got to
[42:39] realize whatever comes against you will
[42:40] not
[42:41] stand
[42:43] amen amen hmon hmon who was an agot and
[42:47] am malachite he couldn't stand against
[42:49] isra and Mori no matter what position he
[42:51] was he became prime minister of the
[42:53] greatest Empire at that time he couldn't
[42:55] stand
[42:57] amen he had to come down so it doesn't
[43:01] matter what is hatched against us amen
[43:04] it will not stand now there's many
[43:07] things that have been written down in
[43:09] the scripture and not just in the
[43:12] scripture well in heaven now Jesus would
[43:16] send out his 70 he' send out his
[43:18] disciples he gave them power and
[43:19] authority over all unclean spirits he
[43:21] said go out two by two preach the gospel
[43:24] cast out Devils heal the sick and raise
[43:25] the dead they came back this is in Luke
[43:28] uh 10:17 and the 77 returned again with
[43:31] Joy saying Lord even the devils are
[43:33] subject unto us through thy name and he
[43:35] said unto them I beheld Satan as
[43:37] lightning fall from Heaven and brother
[43:40] Braham said that this was actually Satan
[43:41] falling from his position of power
[43:43] because the church was Raising in power
[43:46] he says behold I give unto you power to
[43:47] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[43:50] all power of the enemy and nothing shall
[43:52] by any means hurt you amen so nothing
[43:54] can hurt us praise the Lord not with
[43:57] understanding in this Rejoice not he's
[43:59] basically saying no no you're rejoicing
[44:01] actually in the wrong thing it's good to
[44:05] rejoice in those things but there's a
[44:07] greater thing he's basically saying now
[44:09] listen I want you to actually have a
[44:11] greater perspective than this because
[44:14] there'll come times when it seems like
[44:17] God hasn't answered prayer then what are
[44:19] you going to do it seems like the answer
[44:21] doesn't come as quickly as it has in the
[44:23] past then what are you going to do it
[44:26] seems like the more you pray the worst
[44:27] the situation gets and then what are you
[44:29] going to do see we got to look beyond
[44:32] what we see you say well my timeline is
[44:35] very different to God's absolutely we
[44:38] all want this but God says no I'm not
[44:41] always going to give you this sometimes
[44:42] I will but I don't love you any less if
[44:45] I don't give you it like this you see
[44:48] because if we get everything just like
[44:49] that we become spoiled there's no
[44:51] character being formed see God Is Not
[44:53] What what God is interested in is
[44:56] looking down and seeing a group of
[44:57] people or individuals that look exactly
[45:00] by in in terms of character exactly like
[45:03] him when he looks down he sees his own
[45:06] word on display he sees his own nature
[45:09] his character that's what he sees when
[45:11] he sees his bride right that's what he's
[45:12] interested in the Rapture is going to be
[45:14] God taking his character from the
[45:17] earth he's taking his attributes part of
[45:20] himself that's what the Rapture is going
[45:21] to be right amen so he says you know
[45:26] I've given you this power and this power
[45:28] is still here Mark 16 is the true church
[45:29] in action brother Bram said amen and we
[45:33] are I Believe by God's grace the bride
[45:36] is Mark 16 in action right but he says
[45:39] not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[45:41] that the spirits are subject unto you
[45:43] but rather Rejoice because your names
[45:45] are written in heaven amen so there is a
[45:49] you know there's a greater rejoicing
[45:50] when we realize our names are written in
[45:53] heaven amen not just on a church book
[45:56] not that we have a church Church book
[45:57] with names not just cuz you're on a
[45:59] WhatsApp list whatever you know but no
[46:01] that your names are written in heaven
[46:03] now the reason I believe that Jesus
[46:06] would say this I I think Christian and I
[46:08] were talking about this um a while ago
[46:10] but the reason you know Jesus would
[46:12] would would say this is because what can
[46:13] happen is people can become arrogant
[46:16] they can become arrogant thinking
[46:18] they're like Rambo and they can do
[46:19] whatever they want whenever they want
[46:21] and and God will have to obey what they
[46:25] say God don't want arrogant
[46:28] Christians God resists the proud gives
[46:31] grace to the humble see you know there
[46:33] can you an attitude can come in among
[46:36] Believers the book's open to me I'm an
[46:39] adopted son of God now it's just me now
[46:43] Jesus was never like that he said the
[46:45] son can do nothing till the father shows
[46:47] him and what the father does he does
[46:49] likewise right he says it's not me that
[46:51] doeth the works but the father in me
[46:52] doeth the works right so he never took
[46:54] he never took any um credit for anything
[46:58] based on what he did because of what he
[47:00] did he said it's always the father that
[47:01] does it right so so we never want to let
[47:06] a and and even brother Brown would say
[47:08] in the message humble thyself he says if
[47:10] you want to get somewhere with God never
[47:13] let an arrogant Spirit ever come around
[47:16] don't let No Malice come no matter what
[47:18] anybody says if they're all wrong don't
[47:20] you never build up a complex against
[47:22] that person see you be sweet and kind
[47:25] remember God loved you when you're in
[47:27] sin and if the spirit of God is in you
[47:29] you love the other person when he's been
[47:31] wrong see just pray for him and love one
[47:34] another above everything love God and
[47:37] love one another and be humble with God
[47:39] and around one another and God will
[47:42] bless it and it's hard telling what he
[47:45] will
[47:48] do
[47:51] amen amen so we never want to let an
[47:54] arrogant Spirit come around us to think
[47:56] that oh I did that or I said this or I
[47:59] did this no that's why Jesus I believe
[48:02] said to them no no don't rejoice in that
[48:03] that the spirit's are subject un you but
[48:05] rather Rejoice because your names are
[48:07] written in heaven because you begin you
[48:08] know when you really begin to think
[48:10] about that my name was there before I
[48:12] ever knew it God by the blood of the
[48:16] Lamb would write my name on the Lamb's
[48:18] Book of Life before the foundation of
[48:21] the world Amen that before I ever turned
[48:24] up before there was any Star molecule or
[48:26] anything God thought of me God thought
[48:29] of me he knew the age I'd be born in he
[48:31] knew the pressure that would come upon
[48:32] me he know the trouble I would go
[48:34] through he knew everything that would
[48:36] happen but yet before any of that could
[48:39] ever come into existence he made a way
[48:41] for me to overcome that problem am mean
[48:43] because the lamb was slammed before the
[48:45] foundation of the world am mean so
[48:47] before the devil was ever created your
[48:49] name was on the book amen so now if your
[48:53] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:54] because as um it's says in Revelations
[48:57] 13 that everyone worshiped the Beast
[49:00] whose names were not written in the
[49:02] Lamb's Book of the life slam from the
[49:03] foundation of the world right so so if
[49:06] God if God wrote your name in glory
[49:09] before there was anything then how yeah
[49:12] I know I've said these things before but
[49:14] rehearse these things in the years of
[49:16] Joshua right I'm rehearsing some things
[49:19] because I believe the more we realize
[49:22] who we
[49:23] are and the we're not going to shake as
[49:26] the world shakes we're not going to fall
[49:28] apart as the World falls apart right
[49:30] we'll have greater confidence in our God
[49:33] than ever before amen so there
[49:36] so if our names were written before
[49:39] there was anything how can the devil you
[49:41] know and it was done in eternity how can
[49:43] the devil ever undo what God has done
[49:46] how can he do it in time when God has
[49:48] already done it in eternity he cannot do
[49:51] it amen so the so Jesus is telling his
[49:53] disciples don't
[49:55] Rejoice uh you know in that but rather
[49:58] Rejoice that your names are written in
[49:59] heaven you say well Judas was among them
[50:01] and that is true and now I'm not going
[50:03] to speak on the you we know there's the
[50:05] Book of Life in the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:06] your brother says one runs into the
[50:08] other The Book of Life not everyone's
[50:10] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life but
[50:11] everyone's name is on the book of life
[50:13] and judas's name was on the book of life
[50:16] right and and on that book names can be
[50:18] rubbed out like Judas but people who are
[50:21] on the L book of life doesn't matter
[50:23] what they've done it can't be rubbed out
[50:27] praise
[50:28] God
[50:31] Amen
[50:34] so brother would say
[50:37] this he
[50:39] says he says uh speaking of the two
[50:42] books he'd say it's like your natural
[50:44] life is The Book of Life then it runs
[50:45] into the Lamb's Book of Life he's like
[50:48] he says it's like a stalk of wheat it
[50:50] just grows from one form to another but
[50:54] then the life doesn't stay when when
[50:56] when wheat is growing it doesn't stay in
[50:58] the you know it it eventually gets into
[51:00] the seed so that first part of the plant
[51:03] becomes dead right so when you're born
[51:06] it's just you know and then you come to
[51:08] an age of accountability then God starts
[51:10] in heaven starts recording all you've
[51:12] done you know it starts recording but
[51:15] then but your name is already on the
[51:16] Lamb's Book of Life but God's got to
[51:18] deal with your book of life because
[51:21] there can't be anything held against you
[51:23] on that day or even this day right so
[51:25] what happens is then there Comes A Time
[51:27] and God when when you receive the Lord
[51:31] right God gets a hold of you you confess
[51:32] your sins you realize you're lost then
[51:34] what happens the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:36] comes down takes your book of life and
[51:39] dips it in the sea of God's
[51:40] forgetfulness right and when he pulls it
[51:42] out it's all blank pages Hallelujah why
[51:45] because the blood has cleansed it
[51:47] completely amen and now what are you
[51:49] living you're not living your book of
[51:50] life anymore but you're living from the
[51:52] Lamb's Book of Life so your identity in
[51:54] who you are is the word of God that so
[51:57] the first part was your natural life but
[51:59] then when you become a Christian you
[52:01] live a different kind of life which is
[52:03] from the Lamb's Book of
[52:04] Life praise the
[52:07] Lord and then now we come down to this
[52:09] age John would be a representation of
[52:12] the Bride you know in the Book of
[52:15] Revelation I hope I'm not boring you
[52:16] tonight John John would be John would be
[52:19] a symbol in the book uh of a of a group
[52:22] of people and we know as brother says
[52:25] one man in a Vision represents a whole
[52:27] body of people and and we see uh at the
[52:30] end of the Lan Church age your re your
[52:32] Revelations 4:1 your John says now um
[52:35] that same voice I heard it in heaven a
[52:37] door was open in heaven and a voice said
[52:39] come up hither so John was translated up
[52:42] into Glory representing the bride body
[52:44] of Jesus Christ raptured in the end time
[52:46] but then now John is standing there
[52:49] because because there's something that
[52:51] happens when when the book comes open
[52:53] and you see yourself and John was
[52:56] standing there he heard the uh you the
[52:57] angel the you a strong angel cry out
[53:00] who's worthy to take the book he could
[53:02] see the book was in the hand of the
[53:03] original owner on the throne of God you
[53:05] know it was God you know was in God's
[53:07] possession and John looked around he saw
[53:09] no man was found worthy to take the book
[53:11] or even look upon it you know to loose
[53:13] the seals and and John began to weep
[53:15] much because he realized if there was no
[53:17] man found worthy then then the the the
[53:20] Plan of Redemption was stalled God could
[53:23] not restore if there's no man found
[53:25] worthy the angs were worthy but they had
[53:27] never been men right they never they
[53:29] never been men but then you know as he
[53:31] was crying you know all the prophets
[53:33] were there but they weren't worthy
[53:34] doesn't matter how perfect of our life
[53:36] they told even Joseph the only thing
[53:37] held against him was a lie that he told
[53:40] his father to tell Pharaoh that's the
[53:41] one Mark held against him in the whole
[53:43] book of Genesis he wasn't worthy because
[53:45] they're all born they're all born with a
[53:48] fallen nature but then when he was
[53:51] weeping one of the elders came to him
[53:53] and said weep not John for the lion of
[53:55] the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he
[53:57] turned and he looked he saw the lamb so
[54:00] he saw that one that he that he that he
[54:02] went fishing with and he saw the one
[54:05] that you know that stood at lazarus's
[54:06] tomb said Lazarus come forth he saw that
[54:08] one that died on Calvary he saw that one
[54:10] that resurrected in a glorified form he
[54:13] saw him step forth and then now when
[54:17] John when John saw him take the book and
[54:20] everyone begin to Rejoice because
[54:22] remember in that scene is actually all
[54:23] the redeemed see you're in that scene
[54:27] you're in that scene right everyone is
[54:30] in that all of God's redeemed are in
[54:31] that scene cuz thou has redeemed us back
[54:34] to God by thy blood right so now John
[54:37] begin to rejoice and he be and it says
[54:39] that everything in Heaven and Earth and
[54:41] under the Earth heard him cry out
[54:42] blessings and honor and glory to the
[54:43] lamb amen and and why what happened
[54:46] because when the lamb opened the book
[54:48] what happened John saw his name on the
[54:51] book and brother Braham said old John
[54:53] who had been standing there a brother
[54:55] crying why he said everything in heaven
[54:57] everything in Earth everything in the
[54:58] sea heard me holler amen blessings honor
[55:01] and might and power be to him that lives
[55:03] forever and ever talk about a happy time
[55:05] when them seals broke John must have
[55:07] looked in past the curtain of time um
[55:09] and said there's John amen he is so
[55:12] happy everything in heaven everything
[55:13] heard him cry out why so there he was
[55:16] standing on the aisle of Patmos which
[55:17] was a prison Colony Island but by
[55:20] Revelation he looked past a curtain of
[55:21] time and he saw himself standing around
[55:25] the throne Redeemed by by the blood of
[55:26] the Lamb Hallelujah and that's why Jesus
[55:30] told the disciples in Luke no Rejoice
[55:32] that your name is written in heaven amen
[55:34] and it became so real to John by
[55:36] Revelation amen everything heard him cry
[55:39] out rejoicing to the Lord hallelujah and
[55:42] would not that have given him a greater
[55:44] stability in his life than anything else
[55:47] I mean do you know that when the word
[55:49] comes open to you God does the same
[55:50] thing am me when you hear the voice
[55:52] behind the voice you realize it's more
[55:54] than a prophet speaking to you amen it's
[55:56] it's more than just ink on paper that
[55:58] you're reading but it's God himself
[56:00] expressed amen what is that God opening
[56:02] his book to you revealing that your name
[56:04] is on his book Hallelujah so now we can
[56:08] Rejoice well what has this got to do
[56:10] with the amalekites what's got
[56:11] everything to do with that battle
[56:13] because you realize if I'm there already
[56:16] if I've got representation there if my
[56:19] theophany is already there amen there
[56:21] nothing in this battle can take me out
[56:25] nothing in this battle can take me out
[56:27] remember the Warfare may change because
[56:28] we're living in an age of lukewarmness
[56:31] we're living in the age of ladyo the
[56:33] devil see the see the worst thing we can
[56:35] ever come to is think we don't need any
[56:36] more of
[56:37] God well I'm comfortable I'm fine God's
[56:41] done a lot for me I still love him but
[56:43] I'm
[56:45] okay now what we should have a hung see
[56:48] that's a lukewarm Spirit trying to just
[56:49] keep us in a plateau that doesn't mean
[56:52] you don't have your salvation but
[56:54] where's your Victory right so so that's
[56:56] the most because that's how the devil's
[56:58] Warfare Works in this age we're
[57:00] comfortable we're fine we're good I'm
[57:04] fine I know in whom I have believed all
[57:06] yeah and all that's very true but he
[57:08] just wants us just to plateau and be
[57:10] comfortable
[57:12] right but we shouldn't be like that we
[57:15] should realize that's a weapon formed
[57:17] against us it can be the most subtle
[57:19] thing that'll ever come against anyone
[57:21] is I'm I'm okay I don't need more well
[57:25] you know but if we can identify that is
[57:28] a lukewarm Spirit trying to rob us of
[57:30] our joy and our Victory amen but we got
[57:32] to realize that thing when it comes
[57:33] against us it's not going to win it's
[57:35] not going to prosper no the victory
[57:38] Jesus won at Calvary is going to come
[57:40] into full manifestation in this age amen
[57:43] why because the dead in Christ are going
[57:45] to raise our bodies are going to be
[57:46] changed and we're going to be gone amen
[57:49] so I believe while while we're still
[57:51] upon this Earth let's keep saying Lord I
[57:53] want more of you I'm just going to
[57:55] finish with this thought this is this is
[57:56] my last comments to you in this in this
[57:59] building say Lord I Want More Of You
[58:02] Lord thank you for all you've done for
[58:03] me you've done so much for me Lord but I
[58:06] want more of you Lord I want to see your
[58:08] word come more alive to me Lord may you
[58:10] become may you more mean more to me more
[58:13] now than you did when you first found me
[58:15] Lord may I love you more may I treasure
[58:16] you more may I have a greater desire to
[58:19] see you
[58:20] live amen you say well how can we
[58:27] a
[58:27] total in
[58:30] order I just say this a total Victory
[58:33] I'm just going to surmise this whole
[58:34] thing let's completely surrender Our
[58:37] Lives into the hands of the Lord like
[58:38] never
[58:39] before and let him have his total way a
[58:42] total
[58:43] Victory okay cuz God says I'm going to
[58:45] fight against the devil from generation
[58:47] to generation so this battle's come into
[58:50] our generation so say Lord use me to
[58:54] finish this battle cuz there will be the
[58:56] last one coming
[58:58] somewhere we were talking we were
[59:00] driving um when we're driving to church
[59:02] you the girls asked um you we asked them
[59:05] I don't I don't know how the
[59:06] conversation started but you know they
[59:08] but but I asked them how long was was
[59:11] was Israel uh in Egypt for one of them
[59:14] said 400 years I think Christine said it
[59:15] was actually 430 years and they said
[59:19] well why the delay well there had to be
[59:21] a delay
[59:23] because many things had to happen
[59:25] because because there certain ones had
[59:27] to be born and also God allows a delay
[59:30] because there's the parable of the man
[59:32] who has all the wealth he gives his
[59:33] talents to his servants and he goes off
[59:35] to a far country Jesus speaks of it and
[59:38] then and then and then one of the
[59:39] servants when it re when they think oh
[59:40] he's he's delaying his coming they get
[59:43] drunk and they begin to strike their
[59:44] fellow servants that when the the master
[59:46] comes back at a time he did not expect
[59:48] so people going to think well God's
[59:50] delaying his his coming there's a
[59:52] purpose in it to see what's really in
[59:55] our hearts
[59:56] and also there is people that H you know
[1:00:00] that God has to delay is coming for cuz
[1:00:01] there's children of his that need to
[1:00:03] come in like you take for example you
[1:00:06] know Rahab was ordained to be married to
[1:00:09] Solomon who was the prince of Judah
[1:00:11] right General in Judah that through that
[1:00:14] that marriage eventually the you know
[1:00:16] the lineage of Jesus Christ came through
[1:00:18] them so if they left Egypt in uh at the
[1:00:23] 400 year mark and they went straight
[1:00:25] into the Promised Land land she wasn't
[1:00:27] there if they left Egypt and didn't
[1:00:29] wander for 40 years she wasn't there so
[1:00:33] there was all this delay because she had
[1:00:35] to be there and God ordained her to be
[1:00:37] there at that present time amen she she
[1:00:40] may think the Lord is delaying his
[1:00:42] coming he's actually right on
[1:00:44] time our timing is not his
[1:00:47] timing so while we're
[1:00:50] here let's run let's love the Lord let's
[1:00:53] serve him you say Lord let through me
[1:00:57] these last few however long we may be
[1:00:59] here for Lord because you said you will
[1:01:02] fight against the enemy from generation
[1:01:04] to generation till his name is totally
[1:01:06] blotted out from under
[1:01:07] Heaven amen so so to me God is telling
[1:01:11] me you're going to win I'm going to
[1:01:13] fight this battle the battle belongs to
[1:01:14] me ien let's have the musicians tonight
