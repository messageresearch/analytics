[39:05] going around i don't feel like one of
[39:06] them right now you know
[39:08] it's a bit busy hey man hallelujah well
[39:10] are we because it's wednesday you know
[39:12] we will keep the
[39:13] entreaties short and we'll go straight
[39:15] into
[39:16] the word of god amen and so you can see
[39:18] up there on the screen
[39:20] um go tell go comma
[39:23] tell amen i like that it's not just go
[39:26] without a commerce go and tell
[39:28] amen hallelujah you know you've got
[39:32] something to tell
[39:33] amen amen we'll talk about that tonight
[39:36] let's turn in our bibles
[39:37] to um mark chapter 16
[39:43] and we're going to read from verses 9
[39:45] through to 20.
[39:47] you know they say that the you know
[39:49] theologians
[39:50] and men of manly wisdom say that
[39:53] that it's not inspired from the ninth
[39:55] verse on so
[39:56] i think if the devil tries to attack
[39:58] something there's something good there
[40:00] you know
[40:00] he put a scarecrow right there so let's
[40:02] see what the scarecrow was hiding
[40:04] amen hallelujah hey man it says here and
[40:08] from the ninth verse a now when jesus
[40:11] was risen early the first day of the
[40:13] week
[40:13] he appeared first to mary magdalene
[40:17] out of whom he had cast seven devils and
[40:20] she went and told them
[40:22] that had been with him as they mourned
[40:25] and wept
[40:28] and they when they had heard that he was
[40:31] alive
[40:32] and had been seen of her believe not
[40:37] after that he appeared in another form
[40:40] unto two of them as they walked and went
[40:43] into the country
[40:44] amen i like that in another form you see
[40:47] the lord appears in different forms
[40:49] and even today the same one is appearing
[40:52] in another form
[40:53] huh you understand you see it's not but
[40:56] just because you can't see him
[40:58] it doesn't mean it's not him or it's not
[41:00] anything less it's the same
[41:02] it's the same i might get ahead of
[41:04] myself amen
[41:06] afterwards it's not not easy to
[41:09] you know you just feel like you've got
[41:11] to go but afterwards he appeared
[41:13] unto the eleven as they said it made and
[41:15] upbraided them
[41:18] with the unbelief and hardness of heart
[41:19] because they believed not them
[41:21] which had seen him after he was risen
[41:26] is there anybody in here that seen him
[41:27] after he was risen
[41:29] have you seen him amen no i'm not
[41:31] talking about with your physical eyes
[41:33] hey
[41:34] if he allows that when praise god but
[41:36] have you seen him after he's risen
[41:38] oh my oh man i love it
[41:42] god is good amen um
[41:45] and he said unto them go ye
[41:48] into all the world and preach the gospel
[41:51] to every creature
[41:53] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[41:55] be saved
[41:56] but he that believeth not shall be
[41:58] damned
[42:00] and these signs shall shall follow them
[42:02] that believe
[42:03] in my name they shall cast out devils
[42:06] they shall speak with new tongues they
[42:09] shall take up serpents
[42:11] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[42:14] shall not hurt them
[42:16] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[42:19] they shall recover
[42:21] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[42:23] them he was received up
[42:25] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[42:28] god
[42:29] and they went forth and preached
[42:32] everywhere
[42:35] the lord working with them and
[42:38] confirming the word
[42:39] of signs following amen amen
[42:42] you may have your seats god bless you
[42:46] i want to repeat that 20th verse just
[42:47] for emphasis sorry it's very small
[42:51] it looked big on my computer screen and
[42:54] they went forth
[42:56] and preached everywhere
[42:59] something happened to these guys and
[43:01] they just had to do it you know
[43:03] there was something charging inside them
[43:05] they couldn't keep quiet
[43:06] they couldn't keep still amen there was
[43:09] just something going on
[43:10] burning hallelujah amen
[43:13] burning in their heart you know this was
[43:16] a very
[43:17] um this is a very uh challenging and
[43:20] powerful
[43:21] scripture here and preached everywhere
[43:24] the lord work this is the key
[43:26] here now the lord working with them
[43:29] see they went to the upper room and when
[43:32] they went to the upper room they did not
[43:33] come down
[43:34] until they met him this is the key to
[43:38] the whole story right
[43:39] we're right at the end now the the key
[43:42] to it
[43:43] is they went to the upper room as they
[43:45] were told
[43:47] and they never left there until
[43:49] something real
[43:50] happened and they met him
[43:54] too many times we go up for prayer
[43:57] to meet jesus and then we leave and we
[43:59] haven't met jesus
[44:01] you know this is true and it burdens my
[44:04] heart i see it at camps i see it at
[44:06] conventions
[44:06] people go up and they pray and they cry
[44:09] and then they walk back the same
[44:11] that's just what happened because people
[44:13] are just not perseverant
[44:15] but the brother brandon preacher is
[44:16] perseverant
[44:20] just be perseverant amen amen
[44:23] the lord is there to be me sometimes
[44:26] it's just a bit of a battle a wrestle
[44:27] with the angel of the lord just to
[44:29] wrestle off some unbelief or something
[44:31] that's hindering
[44:32] amen you know you break through in
[44:34] prayer prayer
[44:36] to break through the sound barrier and
[44:38] when brother branham says when you break
[44:40] through it's like
[44:41] you're not working yourself up into
[44:43] something it's him
[44:44] lifting you up into something it's not
[44:47] you
[44:47] working up this emotion until you get
[44:49] into some euphoria
[44:51] huh it's actually him it's you yielding
[44:56] the lord you know we think that's got to
[44:58] happen straight away it's all got to be
[44:59] fast right
[45:00] the lord doesn't it's not always fast
[45:03] sometimes
[45:04] it happens slowly
[45:07] sometimes it happens straight away man
[45:08] honestly you can just get down
[45:10] and it's like the law's waiting in your
[45:12] office and it's just like instantaneous
[45:15] fellowship
[45:15] and it's amazing and sometimes you've
[45:18] got to just
[45:19] knock on the door a little bit knock on
[45:21] the door until your hands knock through
[45:23] the door if you can
[45:24] just keep knocking and say lord i'm here
[45:27] lord jesus
[45:28] jesus preached and taught about the
[45:30] unjust judge type
[45:32] to show there is a tenacity that is
[45:34] required
[45:35] in many times for us who are stuck in
[45:38] this flesh that's full of unbelief in
[45:40] this human spirit that's so troubled
[45:44] and all these things going on and stuff
[45:46] that's there to hindu
[45:47] like israel they didn't just go over the
[45:50] jordan and all of a sudden
[45:51] jerusalem was theirs huh you see
[45:55] it wasn't just theirs instantly they had
[45:57] there was a
[45:58] fight a long fight but the lord was with
[46:02] them
[46:03] just like the apostles when they came
[46:04] and they came to the upper room and the
[46:05] holy ghost came down
[46:07] everyone wasn't converted all of a
[46:10] sudden
[46:11] they had to go out there they're to face
[46:13] devils
[46:14] they're to face the enemy on every front
[46:18] and the more that jesus worked with them
[46:20] the more they outreached
[46:22] the more the devil would come against
[46:23] them but the thing is they were
[46:26] operating in the purpose of god they
[46:28] were operating in the plan of god and
[46:30] god has a purpose see the lord is
[46:33] longing
[46:34] for his children he's longing to meet
[46:37] his bride
[46:39] he does not want to see people live and
[46:41] sin
[46:42] he doesn't want to see people taking
[46:44] drugs he doesn't want to see
[46:45] people drinking alcohol he doesn't want
[46:47] to see people fornicating he doesn't
[46:49] want to see
[46:50] these things happening in his bride's
[46:52] life and there's bride out there
[46:55] that it's happening there is elect seed
[46:58] that is out there
[46:59] and he doesn't want to see it his burden
[47:04] and there and that burden is the burden
[47:06] of the spirit
[47:07] that burden is the heart of god longing
[47:10] for his children
[47:11] longing to be united and he says
[47:15] go and tell he's calling us
[47:19] to be a witness
[47:22] you are a witness you are called to tell
[47:26] to go and tell you see the first one he
[47:28] came to was mary
[47:30] mary wasn't no special hi
[47:33] society member she was a woman that had
[47:36] seven devils
[47:37] she was a woman that was probably
[47:38] involved in the wrong things well i can
[47:40] say she
[47:41] was definitely involved in the wrong
[47:42] things you don't get seven devils for
[47:44] nothing
[47:44] so she was involved with the wrong
[47:46] things she was a woman that was of low
[47:48] caliber in society
[47:50] pushed down and she was the first one
[47:52] that was
[47:53] given the commission go and tell my
[47:55] disciples
[47:57] oh my god tell
[48:00] my disciples so right at the beget go
[48:04] we have no one that is exempt from the
[48:07] commission
[48:08] you're not exempt just because you feel
[48:10] insignificant
[48:12] or you don't have a ministry that you
[48:14] don't think you do but you
[48:15] do but you're not no one's exempt
[48:19] because of age no matter where we are in
[48:21] our life and our walk
[48:23] we are called to go and tell
[48:27] and you see when you start to operate
[48:31] in that channel in that capacity
[48:35] the lord will work with you and you will
[48:38] begin to see the miracles
[48:40] the signs and the wonders and all those
[48:42] things that are to follow the believer
[48:46] you see but there has to be an active
[48:50] measure on your your part to go and tell
[48:54] and the moment that you begin to say
[48:56] lord this is where it starts lord
[48:58] help me help me lord i don't know what
[49:01] to do
[49:02] you see it's not easy in this day and
[49:05] age of
[49:05] complete darkness and unbelief it's not
[49:08] easy
[49:09] there's not many left that would
[49:10] actually respond but yet
[49:12] we are called to go and tell
[49:16] and therefore it starts with an attitude
[49:18] of the heart
[49:19] lord i'm not a exuberant
[49:22] person that has courage to go and speak
[49:25] to strangers and things like that
[49:27] and therefore and i don't believe that
[49:29] the lord
[49:30] you know will call everybody to that
[49:32] sort of outreach
[49:34] style but yet god knows every name
[49:38] that is written in the lamb's book of
[49:40] life he knows every
[49:42] sheep that's going to come through at
[49:43] the great white throne judgment at the
[49:45] second resurrection
[49:46] he knows every foolish virgin he knows
[49:49] all of them
[49:50] that will come through eventually and
[49:52] will be in the bride he knows all of
[49:54] them
[49:55] so it will not hurt to go home tonight
[49:59] or even now even in the service pray
[50:02] lord jesus please lead me to your
[50:05] children
[50:06] lord lead me to your elected seed you
[50:09] know when we were early on in our church
[50:11] life here when we started praying that
[50:14] the lord just started bringing people
[50:16] hey it was amazing
[50:18] it just and we're called they're called
[50:20] divine appointments
[50:22] and they're people that he brings across
[50:24] your path
[50:25] and they might not be the actual ones to
[50:28] come in but they might know somebody
[50:30] they might let you meet somebody or
[50:32] arrange you to go to something and meet
[50:34] that person but
[50:35] the fact is you become engaged
[50:38] in divine appointments with the lord he
[50:41] gives you a schedule
[50:42] amen a schedule that you don't write
[50:44] down or know about
[50:46] but you just live your life and you you
[50:49] manage to stumble across
[50:50] a situation and you're faced with
[50:52] dialogue with somebody
[50:54] in some place and that person asks some
[50:57] question
[50:58] and then you give them a little tract or
[51:00] a book or you just it just comes out
[51:02] it just comes out you've got something
[51:05] special
[51:09] and i'll get to it later but we have
[51:11] something very
[51:13] very special we have
[51:16] uh the same message on my
[51:20] that mary magdalene had amen we have a
[51:23] risen
[51:24] savior telling us go and tell my
[51:27] disciples
[51:28] go and tell my bride that's stuck in the
[51:29] world go and tell her
[51:32] that i'm calling i'm longing for
[51:36] fellowship
[51:37] this is what we are in now
[51:40] this and i'll get to it
[51:44] i don't have a slide for this one
[51:47] because this one came when we were here
[51:50] acts 1 6 to 9 8 it says here when they
[51:54] therefore would come
[51:55] together they asked of him saying lord
[51:58] will thou at this time restore again the
[52:00] kingdom to israel
[52:02] and he said unto them it is not for you
[52:05] to know the times or the seasons
[52:08] which the father has put in his own
[52:10] power
[52:11] but you shall receive power
[52:15] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[52:17] you and you
[52:19] shall be witnesses unto me in both
[52:22] jerusalem
[52:23] and all judea and in samaria and now
[52:26] he's talking about you
[52:28] to the uttermost part of the earth amen
[52:31] to the uttermost part of the earth and
[52:34] i probably repeat myself every time but
[52:36] new zealand
[52:37] is pretty much as far away as you can
[52:38] get so here we are
[52:41] we're in the uttermost part of the earth
[52:44] and the same jesus
[52:45] who's commissioning us to go and tell
[52:48] to be a witness to to to to
[52:52] to tarry in jerusalem until you receive
[52:54] power
[52:55] when you get that power when you get the
[52:57] holy ghost there's a witness
[52:59] within you that burns in your heart oh i
[53:03] must
[53:04] oh lord where can i go who can i tell
[53:07] it's so glorious lord i want others to
[53:09] taste it
[53:10] oh my help us lord
[53:14] because you can also have the holy
[53:15] spirit and then get yourself over
[53:17] encumbered with things
[53:19] and burdened down with busyness i've
[53:21] been there
[53:23] amen but you see
[53:26] we don't want to div what's the word we
[53:29] don't want to
[53:30] spread our affections out too far
[53:34] just be careful you don't want to just
[53:37] have all these hobbies and all these
[53:39] things
[53:39] that are in your life because what
[53:42] happens is it thins out
[53:44] your potency you only have so much time
[53:49] we only got so much time to be a witness
[53:52] to live this life and it's pertinent to
[53:55] all of us
[53:56] that we just just get back
[53:59] and sit down and just say here i am lord
[54:03] and you basically let go of everything
[54:06] all of your plans
[54:08] and you and i and i don't mean just
[54:09] forget them all to completely but you
[54:11] just let it go and you say lord
[54:15] what is my purpose what is my what's my
[54:17] life for
[54:18] lord i've got all of these things that
[54:20] are kind of on the go
[54:21] but lord i'm willing to surrender
[54:24] anything for you
[54:25] you see the lord is gentle if you just
[54:28] ambitious
[54:29] and you you know and now you can if
[54:31] god's revealed to you you're calling and
[54:33] you can be ambitious for the lord and
[54:35] you're calling right that's fine
[54:36] you know it the lord is working through
[54:38] you he's he's working with you
[54:40] and you're out there you're doing it but
[54:42] maybe some of you don't know that
[54:44] and and so you're in a condition where
[54:46] you're waiting on the lord to be placed
[54:47] and you want to know what
[54:49] the purpose is for your life and and so
[54:51] there's a that you've got to just step
[54:53] back
[54:53] and say lord here i am lord lord what do
[54:56] you want from my life
[54:57] i'm willing to let anything of these
[54:59] things go
[55:00] if you just lead me and his spirit will
[55:03] lead you
[55:04] he will show you what your purpose is he
[55:07] will place you
[55:08] in his body amen
[55:12] so he says you shall receive power after
[55:13] the holy ghost has come upon you
[55:18] amen
[55:20] romans 10 13 to 15 he says for whosoever
[55:23] shall call upon
[55:24] the name of the lord shall be saved how
[55:27] then shall they call on him
[55:29] whom they have not believed this is the
[55:31] process now
[55:32] this is now paul is teaching them there
[55:35] is actually a process
[55:37] for people to come to the lord yes it's
[55:39] not just a haphazard thing
[55:41] unless god is calling a but but you
[55:44] you even paul the prophet messenger to
[55:47] the
[55:48] age god used a member of the body
[55:51] to bring him in you see he actually uses
[55:54] his body to bring forth children
[55:57] so there's a process but it's not the
[56:00] body that's funk that that's
[56:02] that's leading themselves it's actually
[56:04] the lord
[56:05] the spirit of the lord is works within
[56:07] us it works in the ranks of the body of
[56:10] christ who
[56:11] the lord is yearning for his people and
[56:13] so he uses a certain process
[56:16] within the body of christ to to call his
[56:19] people
[56:20] to bring to find those last lost souls
[56:23] and so here we read for whosoever shall
[56:26] call upon the name of the lord shall be
[56:28] saved
[56:29] how then shall they call on him and whom
[56:31] they have not believed
[56:33] and how shall they believe in him of
[56:35] whom they have not heard
[56:37] and how shall they hear without a
[56:39] preacher
[56:41] and how shall they preach except they be
[56:43] sent
[56:46] so you see there is the
[56:49] line of order that god has
[56:52] to find there's there there
[56:56] it has to be the lord begins the whole
[56:59] thing
[56:59] the process begins by sending someone
[57:07] as it is written how beautiful are the
[57:08] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[57:10] peace
[57:11] and bring glad tidings of good things
[57:14] amen
[57:19] so
[57:24] brother branham says this
[57:27] i don't know okay i'll put it after this
[57:30] maybe
[57:31] anyway i'll say this i'll read it out
[57:34] the main purpose
[57:35] that god is doing is to try to get you
[57:38] to believe his son
[57:40] christ jesus died and raised from the
[57:43] dead
[57:44] and is living among you tonight just the
[57:46] same as he was standing here visible
[57:49] like you see me or some of these other
[57:52] people
[57:53] you know this is what he he wants you to
[57:54] believe this is one of the core purposes
[57:57] of god
[57:58] is that he could get a people
[58:01] to believe that jesus christ what he did
[58:05] actually happened and that the person
[58:07] that rose up
[58:08] is here in this place to reveal himself
[58:11] to speak to you
[58:13] to change you he wants to come and sit
[58:15] next to you
[58:16] and he wants to talk to you he wants to
[58:18] speak to you tonight
[58:20] he wants to give you a word and season
[58:22] he wants to
[58:23] encourage you in some way shape or form
[58:26] he wants to commission you he wants to
[58:28] he wants to place you so the person that
[58:31] raised up from the dead is in this place
[58:32] tonight
[58:34] and he has a purpose and a plan for you
[58:36] if you
[58:37] just incline your heir as brother albert
[58:40] preached on
[58:40] incline your heir to the lord tonight
[58:42] amen amen
[58:44] you know brother andy will go right
[58:46] around and things and this and that but
[58:47] the lord will speak to you somewhere
[58:49] amen so incline your ear say lord speak
[58:52] to me
[58:52] i don't want to leave this place without
[58:54] my blessing i need to receive something
[58:56] and
[58:56] and you know this is i just say this off
[59:00] the
[59:01] off the note record but just say
[59:04] it's not easy to outreach right it's
[59:07] embarrassing
[59:09] i'm just going to be honest people will
[59:11] ridicule you that you'll feel
[59:12] embarrassed
[59:13] right and that's the devil putting fear
[59:15] on you that's fear
[59:17] embarrassment there's a fear of
[59:19] embarrassment
[59:20] right you start doing it i mean if you
[59:22] were just
[59:23] you were just known as the crazy
[59:25] preacher and in the town
[59:27] back in the day before there was big
[59:28] cities and corporate things and it was
[59:30] just a village
[59:31] you'd just be known in the city in the
[59:32] little town you're the crazy guy or
[59:34] or the preacher guy you know and never i
[59:36] know you you so there's no embarrassment
[59:38] anymore you're just
[59:39] exposed and revealed but the thing is
[59:42] now in your circles of friends they
[59:43] should know that that you're that one
[59:45] you're the oddball
[59:47] they know that they should know that and
[59:49] when they're in trouble
[59:51] who are they going to come to they're
[59:53] going to come to the oddball
[59:54] because something different about that
[59:56] oddball there's something different
[59:58] about that person
[1:00:00] and when they're in trouble they'll come
[1:00:01] there that's part of this witness that
[1:00:03] we're talking about
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:07] but the reason i said that is it isn't
[1:00:09] easy
[1:00:10] this is not a flowery bed of ease to be
[1:00:12] a true witness of the lord
[1:00:14] you know and i believe that you know
[1:00:16] when we read the book of acts we see
[1:00:18] an extreme condition they lived in a
[1:00:21] very extreme condition on the pains of
[1:00:23] death
[1:00:24] to proclaim the name of jesus i believe
[1:00:27] we'll get back to that condition
[1:00:29] i believe society will turn like that
[1:00:30] again just before we go
[1:00:32] it'll be just like that i mean it's
[1:00:34] almost like that without them able to
[1:00:36] kill us you know in some places they do
[1:00:38] if you go to saudi arabia you preach
[1:00:40] you're going to die you know
[1:00:42] and if you get caught they think you're
[1:00:44] blaspheming islam and all those things
[1:00:46] and there's other places if you go down
[1:00:48] to probably times square in new york
[1:00:50] and while there's a pride parade going
[1:00:52] down there you probably get the hiding
[1:00:53] you know
[1:00:54] you'll get the beats or something will
[1:00:55] happen there'll be crazy
[1:00:57] demons coming on you through people
[1:01:00] trying to attack you and hit you and
[1:01:01] things
[1:01:02] so there is a persecution coming you see
[1:01:04] but did that stop them
[1:01:07] no there would something happen to these
[1:01:09] disciples
[1:01:10] it was so potent inside them
[1:01:14] that they went out there and they just
[1:01:16] went everywhere and
[1:01:18] some it's like you know we call it in
[1:01:19] the business world they got the ball
[1:01:21] rolling
[1:01:22] do you know that saying we're going to
[1:01:24] get the ball rolling it means that
[1:01:25] you're going to get the motion started
[1:01:27] the process
[1:01:28] some processes take time and so you've
[1:01:30] got to get the process beginning
[1:01:31] you know we use it in business a lot and
[1:01:34] so
[1:01:35] they got the ball rolling you know in
[1:01:38] the early church they just got the ball
[1:01:40] rolling
[1:01:41] the ball was rolling and they went out
[1:01:42] there and they just got persecuted and
[1:01:44] whatever they didn't care
[1:01:47] and all of a sudden they realized wow
[1:01:48] the lord's working with us
[1:01:50] everything we saw jesus do he's doing in
[1:01:53] us
[1:01:54] amen and you see
[1:01:58] are we willing to suffer the reproach
[1:02:00] for the cause of christ
[1:02:01] and that's exactly what will happen but
[1:02:03] the lord will work with you
[1:02:05] and you will see the glory of god amen
[1:02:07] you'll see him manifest himself to you
[1:02:10] amen amen he she that loveth me will
[1:02:12] keep my commandments
[1:02:14] go and tell right go and tell
[1:02:18] that's the commandment of the lord and i
[1:02:20] would say it's probably one of the more
[1:02:21] important commandments of the law
[1:02:22] because
[1:02:23] you see that's like the integral part of
[1:02:25] us going home
[1:02:27] i want to go home who wants to go home
[1:02:29] we're not going home until one last
[1:02:31] one's in you know so
[1:02:32] we're going to go tell zacchaeus might
[1:02:34] be up in the skyscraper sycamore in the
[1:02:36] city
[1:02:37] you gotta go find him you know now now
[1:02:40] you probably won't get there physically
[1:02:41] you know i don't think none of us might
[1:02:43] i mean i have ended up in a penthouse
[1:02:45] apartment like sweet
[1:02:47] before but you see but we don't always
[1:02:49] end up in those places but we might do
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:51] and there might be one up there but your
[1:02:52] prayer can get there i know
[1:02:54] you can pray into that place amen amen
[1:02:57] see the lord's eyes could see zacchaeus
[1:02:59] even though he was hiding amen
[1:03:01] his eyes can see the zacchaeuses of the
[1:03:03] 2020. he's got 20 20 vision to see up
[1:03:05] into the skyscrapers
[1:03:07] to see those executives that need to
[1:03:08] come down and be humbled
[1:03:10] and look up amen amen upon
[1:03:14] the man that humbled himself under the
[1:03:16] shortest man
[1:03:17] at the lowest part of the world
[1:03:19] zacchaeus amen
[1:03:21] that was a bit of a i don't know how
[1:03:23] that happened but
[1:03:25] amen amen um but what i was saying is
[1:03:29] just tonight say lord help me
[1:03:32] help me to have to find that place in my
[1:03:36] life
[1:03:36] where i can be a witness for you tonight
[1:03:39] lord give me boldness and strength
[1:03:41] so that i can be a witness for you amen
[1:03:44] children you're at school
[1:03:45] peer pressure's very strong and even
[1:03:47] amongst the children in the church you
[1:03:49] know you guys have got peer pressure as
[1:03:50] well
[1:03:51] and so you know to to be a witness it
[1:03:54] takes boldness it takes courage
[1:03:56] but the lord doesn't matter how old we
[1:03:58] are the lord can give us strength and
[1:04:00] courage
[1:04:01] amen to be a witness and it's so
[1:04:03] essential
[1:04:04] because i believe that there will be
[1:04:07] children
[1:04:08] your age in your age and that that will
[1:04:10] get converted
[1:04:11] amen because they've got to go on a
[1:04:13] rapture amen they're going to come
[1:04:15] and you know what will happen when when
[1:04:17] the rapture happens
[1:04:18] those little children will all of a
[1:04:20] sudden be 18 years old
[1:04:22] amen new children if it happens in the
[1:04:24] next couple of years
[1:04:26] you'll look down one day and you'll be
[1:04:27] you'll be your full size
[1:04:29] just instantly man isn't that amazing
[1:04:33] amen that's cool i mean you're anointed
[1:04:36] to that
[1:04:37] amen you're anointed
[1:04:40] to a rapture we're anointed to be
[1:04:43] raptured out of here one day
[1:04:44] amen the spirit of the lord
[1:04:48] let's go to
[1:04:52] so you know a church
[1:04:57] for that for the purpose of the church
[1:04:59] we see this tabernacle of the
[1:05:00] congregation and we see
[1:05:05] this is the tabernacle of a congregation
[1:05:08] and
[1:05:09] holy of holies the holy place and the
[1:05:12] outer court
[1:05:13] the holy of holies is where the the lord
[1:05:15] is and the heart
[1:05:17] but also that shekinah glory presence
[1:05:21] that can be accessed amen that
[1:05:24] where you receive the baptism of the
[1:05:26] holy spirit where you are converted
[1:05:28] where you're fellowshipping with god
[1:05:30] shut in in the secret place that is the
[1:05:34] absolute necessity for
[1:05:38] a born-again believer to come to and
[1:05:40] there's a process to get there
[1:05:42] but follow approach god in the way
[1:05:45] that's been provided
[1:05:46] now the devil's fought that way he's
[1:05:48] fought tooth and nail
[1:05:50] to block the path to the holy of holies
[1:05:53] by traditions creeds dogmas
[1:05:56] denominationalism fighting politics
[1:05:58] roman catholicism and everything that
[1:06:00] came out of it
[1:06:02] you know the the devil's fought and he's
[1:06:04] blocked it all off
[1:06:06] so that people can't get there but
[1:06:09] praise be to god he sent the spirit of
[1:06:11] elijah in the end time
[1:06:14] elijah rebuilt the altar so that a
[1:06:17] believer like
[1:06:18] us can fall on the altar and god's fire
[1:06:21] can come back in
[1:06:22] amen amen that's what the the purpose is
[1:06:26] now the approach to god
[1:06:30] this is the core
[1:06:33] we must now when we're out reaching
[1:06:36] there's no point in just teaching deep
[1:06:39] amazing things to people
[1:06:42] to to get their mind all worked up
[1:06:45] what's the point of that and i'm and
[1:06:47] it's very hard not to because if you're
[1:06:49] dealing with
[1:06:49] denominational people they want to argue
[1:06:51] with you in that level
[1:06:52] they want to debate with you about
[1:06:54] madness and profit that and
[1:06:56] all of these different preachers and
[1:06:57] teachers and what this one says
[1:06:59] and it's all babylon it's all confusion
[1:07:02] it's all the devil and i'll get to it in
[1:07:04] a minute
[1:07:05] i believe the lord gave me a little
[1:07:07] diagram just to explain it
[1:07:09] in its simplest term there's probably a
[1:07:12] lot more that goes on with it
[1:07:13] but the purpose
[1:07:17] for us to be an effective witness
[1:07:20] is that we share the approach to god
[1:07:24] we bring people to the lord jesus christ
[1:07:27] we teach the people what elijah spoke
[1:07:30] and talked to us
[1:07:31] how to approach god and you will see
[1:07:33] from 49 or whatever the first sermon
[1:07:36] all the way to 65 the last so many or he
[1:07:38] never left it
[1:07:39] he never left these core things
[1:07:43] he never went above it the seals opening
[1:07:45] and all the mysteries being revealed and
[1:07:47] everything
[1:07:48] it still contained bringing people to
[1:07:50] jesus christ
[1:07:53] amen all the other stuff is to give
[1:07:55] identity to the believer that's already
[1:07:57] met him
[1:07:58] to grow up in the statute to understand
[1:08:00] who they are
[1:08:02] to build up in rapturing faith but to
[1:08:05] witness to people
[1:08:06] and especially denominational people
[1:08:09] they
[1:08:10] have no approach correct approach to god
[1:08:14] some of them i can't this is one thing
[1:08:16] that we cannot as people put god in a
[1:08:18] box to say he cannot
[1:08:20] pull someone into this place without
[1:08:21] knowing who brother branham is
[1:08:23] i believe god can do that god can
[1:08:25] witness this god can reveal something to
[1:08:27] somebody
[1:08:27] just to at least get them to first base
[1:08:30] or you know
[1:08:31] get them out of the out of the world
[1:08:33] they can come in some way
[1:08:34] shape or form i don't believe it's very
[1:08:36] easy but there are people i believe that
[1:08:38] can get at least into this outer court
[1:08:42] they can get in there and they will come
[1:08:43] on for in the second resurrection
[1:08:45] because they've
[1:08:46] come so far
[1:08:49] but we're not going to deal with that
[1:08:51] subject today
[1:08:54] the important thing is how
[1:08:58] to testify how do we bring people to the
[1:09:01] lord jesus christ
[1:09:03] what is the approach who are we actually
[1:09:05] what is the message that we have
[1:09:07] because it's we have a message and i was
[1:09:10] telling people about it on sunday
[1:09:11] because it was just burning in my heart
[1:09:14] we have a message a real message
[1:09:17] amen the prophet's ministry he said this
[1:09:21] is my ministry
[1:09:22] to declare him that he is here
[1:09:26] he's risen again amen he's not shadowed
[1:09:29] down by
[1:09:30] all of these dogmas and creeds but the
[1:09:33] holy ghost
[1:09:34] was loosed again to be free to
[1:09:38] come and reveal himself in its fullness
[1:09:41] so the person of jesus christ
[1:09:44] is here and you and i have
[1:09:48] the the authority and also
[1:09:51] the commission to bring people to him
[1:09:54] that is your message your message is not
[1:09:57] a bunch of doctrines
[1:09:59] your message that you're telling people
[1:10:01] you've been given
[1:10:03] a simple easy biblical
[1:10:06] practical approach to god elijah's come
[1:10:10] in the end time
[1:10:11] to restore the altar and you can tell
[1:10:14] people
[1:10:14] how to get to that altar amen if they
[1:10:18] get to that altitude and it's all in the
[1:10:19] bible
[1:10:20] you don't need a quote book you don't
[1:10:22] need seven church ages you don't need
[1:10:24] that yet
[1:10:25] all you need to do is teach them the
[1:10:28] approach to god
[1:10:29] in the bible because guess what the
[1:10:31] prophet's quote book was the bible
[1:10:34] and everything in the message is in the
[1:10:35] bible everything in the message is in
[1:10:38] the bible
[1:10:39] and so if you don't use wisdom when
[1:10:41] you're witnessing to people
[1:10:43] and you just go straight on to prophets
[1:10:46] and preachers and teachers and all of
[1:10:48] this
[1:10:48] what you're doing is you're going to
[1:10:50] keep people
[1:10:51] in the religious realm
[1:10:55] of arguments and fighting and grey
[1:10:58] lukewarm church age
[1:11:02] that's where you'll fight the people and
[1:11:05] they will
[1:11:05] and this is where it becomes this is
[1:11:08] where this is
[1:11:08] this is really the core of tinnitus they
[1:11:11] will
[1:11:12] try the devil will anoint people
[1:11:15] to keep them out here
[1:11:19] arguing a few about a prophet whether he
[1:11:21] was a true prophet or not going on all
[1:11:23] these websites and this and that and
[1:11:24] everything
[1:11:25] and you've got to just go horon shush
[1:11:28] and stop
[1:11:29] i'm not talking about man i am not
[1:11:32] talking about prophets
[1:11:34] the lord will lead the election to the
[1:11:36] truth but you have to use wisdom in this
[1:11:38] fight
[1:11:40] and if you get caught up in a this man
[1:11:42] and this leader and this prophet said
[1:11:44] this and this one said that
[1:11:45] then they have prophets and everything
[1:11:47] in their own
[1:11:49] realms all sorts of balaams
[1:11:52] all sorts of great high name men
[1:11:56] that do massive miracles all over so
[1:11:58] it's not about that's the word
[1:12:01] you'll see in a minute now and i mean
[1:12:03] this stuff we already know right
[1:12:05] so i'm just giving you a refresher so
[1:12:09] where are we so
[1:12:13] we don't want to get caught up in the
[1:12:16] debates
[1:12:16] of all the religious realm see in this
[1:12:19] denominational religious realm
[1:12:21] as you can see they're not in here at
[1:12:23] all
[1:12:24] they're not in there the the re the only
[1:12:28] way to get in there
[1:12:29] is by the word of god by the waters of
[1:12:32] separation who knows the waters of
[1:12:34] separation
[1:12:35] so if there's no waters of separation
[1:12:38] no one can come into the tabernacle of
[1:12:40] the congregation
[1:12:41] no one can come in here and without the
[1:12:44] waters of separation
[1:12:45] no one the priesthood couldn't even come
[1:12:47] in here to do the religious
[1:12:50] and you can't have a waters of
[1:12:51] separation now without a red heifer
[1:12:54] that red cow and it's bright red oh not
[1:12:57] bright red but it's
[1:12:58] it's not cliff of the cow but it's
[1:13:00] actually it's like a reddish color
[1:13:02] but it's pure no blemish and they've
[1:13:05] been trying to get one for a long time
[1:13:06] and they
[1:13:07] they you know these guys man if you
[1:13:09] follow like and i don't follow them but
[1:13:11] if you did you know because um there is
[1:13:13] brethren that do
[1:13:15] um they're finding this red heifer you
[1:13:17] know and it's like has to be perfect
[1:13:19] and that stands for the word that is
[1:13:21] pure and the red is the blood
[1:13:23] standing for pure blood and a bleeding
[1:13:25] word that would preach from that blood
[1:13:28] a pure message and that pure message and
[1:13:30] that pure
[1:13:31] witness of the true approach to god
[1:13:35] to bring a person out of that realm
[1:13:40] and i believe that this realm is
[1:13:42] probably the hardest realm
[1:13:44] to work in because those religious
[1:13:47] people
[1:13:48] have got it all sown up and what they
[1:13:50] believe is close to their heart
[1:13:52] and the only thing you cannot argue them
[1:13:55] with all of these things and
[1:13:57] they've seen the miracles it's not about
[1:13:59] that but there is one thing
[1:14:01] or there's actually a few and i wouldn't
[1:14:03] say just one but the lord
[1:14:05] there is an approach there's an approach
[1:14:09] jesus christ has risen from the dead
[1:14:13] jesus christ has come out of the grave
[1:14:16] out of the tomb
[1:14:17] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:18] forever this is the key stone
[1:14:22] to to to to begin is this the that jesus
[1:14:25] christ is the same
[1:14:27] and the same jesus that was revealed in
[1:14:30] the bible
[1:14:31] the same jesus that rose up is here in
[1:14:33] his full
[1:14:34] measure to work with you
[1:14:37] remember he's working with you and as
[1:14:40] you go out
[1:14:41] and you begin to tell these people about
[1:14:44] these things
[1:14:46] you will see if there's election there
[1:14:49] this is what you can't argue with it
[1:14:53] now they can try and there and there is
[1:14:55] a gospel guard
[1:14:57] and the gospel god has anyone heard of
[1:14:59] the gospel guards before
[1:15:01] so gospel god brother branham brings out
[1:15:03] the gospel guards are things that god's
[1:15:05] placed in the scripture
[1:15:07] to stop certain people from entering
[1:15:09] into things
[1:15:10] and believing things and and a gospel
[1:15:13] guard in the scripture
[1:15:14] was given in matthew 28 verse 19.
[1:15:17] now it's actually very simple and the
[1:15:20] lord was not being deceptive in any way
[1:15:22] but it's the way he said it he said
[1:15:26] go into all the world baptizing them in
[1:15:29] the name
[1:15:31] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:15:33] holy ghost
[1:15:35] now people took that
[1:15:39] under constantine and the early roman
[1:15:42] church that began to compromise and
[1:15:43] walked away from the true
[1:15:45] altar of god and the lord said you're
[1:15:48] going to take my name
[1:15:50] out of the church and they took his name
[1:15:52] out of the church
[1:15:53] when they took the baptism in the name
[1:15:55] of jesus christ away
[1:15:58] what teaching would you find
[1:16:01] almost everywhere through the message
[1:16:04] that you must be baptized in the name of
[1:16:05] jesus christ
[1:16:06] and that jesus christ is the same
[1:16:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:09] he's saying that you must be identified
[1:16:14] with the death burial and resurrection
[1:16:16] of the living god that is in this room
[1:16:19] and his name is jesus christ his
[1:16:22] name is jesus hallelujah
[1:16:26] and he is looking for a bride to take
[1:16:28] his name
[1:16:30] and this is one of the keystones
[1:16:33] to a true witness to bring the people
[1:16:37] to the narrow straight way
[1:16:41] it may be seen so simple but if they
[1:16:44] can't take that
[1:16:45] there's no point in going much further
[1:16:48] you see
[1:16:49] you'll just get caught up in a bird
[1:16:51] flurry in this grey
[1:16:53] lukewarm neither light nor dark and it's
[1:16:56] not a good place to be
[1:16:58] but there is a zacchaeus there's a mary
[1:17:02] hey man they're out there they're out
[1:17:05] there
[1:17:06] they're undelivered they're out there
[1:17:08] crying out in their soul
[1:17:10] oh i just saw something real man they're
[1:17:13] sick of their churchianity
[1:17:15] this they're just always searching for
[1:17:16] something more who's been there
[1:17:19] who's been searching churches and
[1:17:21] realizing that it's just not really
[1:17:23] there
[1:17:24] hey this is it they're out there still
[1:17:29] they're out there and when god anoints
[1:17:32] and uses you
[1:17:35] to reveal to them the true name of god
[1:17:39] when they see that peter revealed the
[1:17:42] name
[1:17:42] of the father and of the son of the holy
[1:17:44] ghost and just the words that you speak
[1:17:48] if god's in it and he's as we read in
[1:17:50] mark 16 20
[1:17:51] working with you that says my words are
[1:17:54] spirit in their life
[1:17:56] then god's going to use your words to
[1:17:59] carry a spirit down into those people
[1:18:01] and reveal who he is
[1:18:03] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:18:06] through your lips
[1:18:07] and they go poof
[1:18:11] that's his name all of a sudden they get
[1:18:13] a revelation of the godhead
[1:18:15] that's one of the most important things
[1:18:19] for somebody to go that that'll never
[1:18:22] leave them
[1:18:23] because when you recognize the eternal
[1:18:26] alpha and omega of jesus christ that
[1:18:28] he's not just some
[1:18:30] second person of a trinity amen
[1:18:33] that's imagination people worshiping an
[1:18:37] imagination
[1:18:39] praying to the father and then i better
[1:18:40] pray to the son a bit more
[1:18:42] and they're all like i just feel a bit
[1:18:43] strange doing this if there's election
[1:18:45] there because the seed can't
[1:18:46] accept that can it it's just
[1:18:48] unacceptable
[1:18:50] but then one day some unknowing
[1:18:54] person that fellowships in stokes valley
[1:18:57] just
[1:18:58] finds themselves in a little situation
[1:19:00] and then all of a sudden
[1:19:02] and they might you you'll find if you
[1:19:04] have a long-term relationship
[1:19:06] they know that you believe in a prophet
[1:19:08] they know that you believe that these
[1:19:09] have been a prophet
[1:19:10] but when you're witnessing to them don't
[1:19:13] let the devil take you onto that
[1:19:15] ground about all of those things because
[1:19:17] if they meet the lord
[1:19:19] if they truly meet the lord and
[1:19:21] surrender their lives and come through
[1:19:23] water baptism
[1:19:25] they will come out of that religious
[1:19:27] realm
[1:19:28] they'll come through the
[1:19:32] that says waters of separation
[1:19:35] see the waters of separation need to be
[1:19:38] at that gate
[1:19:39] for the believer that's believing the
[1:19:41] word that's being preached
[1:19:43] out here in these other realms i'll get
[1:19:44] to it in a minute but out here
[1:19:46] that someone's got to testify and send
[1:19:49] the gospel trumpet out
[1:19:51] the word of god how do we approach god
[1:19:55] how do we come to that altar it's in the
[1:19:57] name of jesus christ
[1:19:58] to be identified in the death burial and
[1:20:01] resurrection
[1:20:02] of jesus christ to come through the
[1:20:05] waters of separation
[1:20:06] god can use you to minister the waters
[1:20:10] of separation
[1:20:12] as a king and priest amen
[1:20:16] so just avail yourself to the lord and
[1:20:18] climb thine air unto him
[1:20:20] have a willing heart amen
[1:20:24] so now we have
[1:20:28] the denominational religious realm then
[1:20:30] we have the false religious
[1:20:32] realm which is all just everything else
[1:20:34] you see that
[1:20:35] they're getting further and further away
[1:20:37] then you have
[1:20:38] atheism in the world and then probably
[1:20:41] further down you just got demons and
[1:20:42] devils right
[1:20:44] now this is just this is just my own
[1:20:46] picture it's nothing
[1:20:47] it's just i just wanted to use that as a
[1:20:49] way to describe
[1:20:50] what i was talking about but you see now
[1:20:52] here
[1:20:54] these green things is us preaching it's
[1:20:57] us teaching it's us witnessing it's us
[1:20:58] being a testimony
[1:21:00] now we can i you know obviously i didn't
[1:21:03] want to spend too much time on this but
[1:21:05] these arrows are to go into every realm
[1:21:07] we're meant to be outreaching into all
[1:21:09] these different realms aren't we well
[1:21:10] you know we want to be a witness we
[1:21:11] don't just want to be a witness
[1:21:12] to denominational believers we don't
[1:21:15] just want to be a witness to
[1:21:16] fault people in idolatry you see and we
[1:21:19] don't just want to be a witness out in
[1:21:20] the scientific atheistic
[1:21:22] type of world of of of secularism you
[1:21:25] see we've got to be a witness in all of
[1:21:26] those realms and so there
[1:21:28] you see and i i truly believe that you
[1:21:31] know
[1:21:31] the the these different realms have
[1:21:34] different things that are hard and
[1:21:35] different things that are
[1:21:36] attributes about them you know you're
[1:21:38] going to come if you go into the false
[1:21:40] religion world you're going to come
[1:21:41] against witchcraft and witch doctors and
[1:21:43] all those sort of things
[1:21:44] and and they're going to come at you
[1:21:46] like that but you see the same spirits
[1:21:48] and the same demons that are coming at
[1:21:49] you of witch doctors are coming at you
[1:21:51] with theology
[1:21:53] they're coming at you with babylonian
[1:21:54] ideas and understandings and
[1:21:56] paganistic views of god and the atheists
[1:21:59] oh my
[1:22:01] my i was an atheist they just got an
[1:22:03] awful temper
[1:22:04] and an awful they just flare up but yet
[1:22:08] yet they've got seven reasons why they
[1:22:11] don't believe in god
[1:22:13] and we have the answer to all those
[1:22:15] reasons amen
[1:22:17] hallelujah these guys don't
[1:22:20] but we do because you see
[1:22:24] we have the waters of separation
[1:22:27] we've got the living god amen
[1:22:30] we've got the bleeding word the word the
[1:22:33] blood of jesus christ the one that
[1:22:34] speaks
[1:22:36] he says the new testament is in my blood
[1:22:39] that testament is in you and if you
[1:22:41] avail yourself to the lord
[1:22:43] and you come to talk to somebody and
[1:22:45] you've got you're you're right there
[1:22:47] god's spirit can speak through you he
[1:22:50] can speak through you
[1:22:52] and that person may be a seed zone
[1:22:56] but go and tell
[1:23:00] and then you're going to get people that
[1:23:02] come in from all these different sectors
[1:23:06] and i believe that this church is ready
[1:23:09] we're ready and ripe the embers are
[1:23:10] burning hot
[1:23:12] we're burning hot you see you know a
[1:23:14] fire when it gets to
[1:23:16] if you watch a fire you build a fire you
[1:23:18] get it so the base is real hot you know
[1:23:20] and all the embers are just burning and
[1:23:22] when you put a new
[1:23:23] wood on that fire it just eats it up
[1:23:25] that's good
[1:23:26] the new fire is it's a bit cool you know
[1:23:29] it takes a while
[1:23:30] but once that bed i believe we're there
[1:23:33] got a
[1:23:33] hotbed of embers amen and we just got to
[1:23:36] get some new wood
[1:23:37] and so let's ask god lord give us some
[1:23:40] new wood on the fire
[1:23:42] amen lord lead us to your elected seed
[1:23:45] amen lord give us divine appointments
[1:23:47] coming up
[1:23:48] amen lord lead us to your children he
[1:23:51] knows who they are
[1:23:53] he knows and he's in the business of
[1:23:55] leading people
[1:23:57] he's led people all the way from the
[1:23:58] beginning in fact he wrote the bible
[1:24:00] with people's lives and they didn't even
[1:24:02] realize it was happening
[1:24:04] you read ruth you read you you read
[1:24:06] those stories
[1:24:07] right who reads the stories and you find
[1:24:11] clear prophecies right through right
[1:24:13] that tell you who you are
[1:24:15] they didn't know that was happening
[1:24:16] there was no orchestration there was no
[1:24:19] like as isaac would know you know you
[1:24:21] got to write out all the lines and the
[1:24:22] scripts there was no script
[1:24:24] but yet there was script god
[1:24:26] predetermined all that would happen
[1:24:28] right
[1:24:28] these people just lived out and bible
[1:24:31] was written
[1:24:32] and you read that and you get glorified
[1:24:34] blessed and it shows you that you're
[1:24:36] part of the word and
[1:24:37] living in the land and you know who you
[1:24:39] are by ruth by esther by all these
[1:24:41] different lives and
[1:24:42] by david and by all of these things
[1:24:44] right and you see
[1:24:46] they didn't they just lived it out but
[1:24:48] god let them
[1:24:49] and god can lead you who's full of the
[1:24:51] holy ghost
[1:24:53] who's followed the spirit of god he can
[1:24:56] lead you
[1:24:57] to those elected seed amen
[1:25:00] now i i believe that the last race the
[1:25:03] last leg of this race
[1:25:05] needs to be more supernatural
[1:25:13] it must be more supernatural than going
[1:25:15] out there in the street on the soapbox
[1:25:17] and people giving their lives to the
[1:25:18] lord and the time of the harvest
[1:25:20] the great harvests the great outdoor
[1:25:22] preaching days of john wesley and
[1:25:24] and all those times where thousands were
[1:25:26] coming in huge amounts
[1:25:29] and it was indicated in the sky when the
[1:25:31] moons and all of that
[1:25:33] you know in the time of the seven church
[1:25:34] ages and and the lord indicated a great
[1:25:37] amount of light in those days
[1:25:38] compared to now where the lord gave no
[1:25:41] light
[1:25:42] so here we are and then brother branham
[1:25:46] i don't remember the details but he was
[1:25:48] able to put a little slither
[1:25:50] and you're that slither there's a few
[1:25:54] there's a few that have that are part of
[1:25:57] that little slither there
[1:25:58] and so it's going to take a prophetic
[1:26:00] vision of the lord
[1:26:02] in your own life lord help me lord
[1:26:05] lead me to your children lord father
[1:26:07] give me wisdom when i
[1:26:09] when i speak to them lord help me all of
[1:26:12] us
[1:26:13] maybe someone's sitting here tonight
[1:26:14] going man it's just not me i just don't
[1:26:16] have the courage to do it
[1:26:18] lay that fear down tonight it's only
[1:26:21] fear
[1:26:22] it's only fear and see fear cripples
[1:26:24] faith
[1:26:25] but tonight the lord can take that fear
[1:26:27] away
[1:26:28] amen you will not be rejected in heaven
[1:26:31] you may have a bitter rejection down
[1:26:33] here but what does it matter
[1:26:35] because where we're going eye has not
[1:26:37] seen or is there heard
[1:26:39] nor has it entered the heart of man the
[1:26:40] things which god has prepared for them
[1:26:42] that love them
[1:26:43] it goes beyond anything the prophet said
[1:26:45] it's beyond anything you could dream
[1:26:47] how good it is how wonderful heaven is
[1:26:50] amen so you see we need to bring people
[1:26:54] there
[1:26:56] so here we have
[1:26:59] this is this is this is what we need
[1:27:02] right here
[1:27:02] at the gate of the of the approach to
[1:27:06] god is a clear message
[1:27:08] that clear message is jesus christ has
[1:27:10] risen
[1:27:11] and he is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:13] forever and he's alive forevermore
[1:27:15] and he does the same things today as he
[1:27:17] did in the bible
[1:27:19] and this is how you approach him this is
[1:27:22] the biblical approach
[1:27:23] to god and they'll ask questions and you
[1:27:26] can share the history
[1:27:27] of how the name was taken out of the
[1:27:30] church if we all know that it's all
[1:27:32] common knowledge and they can go back in
[1:27:33] history
[1:27:34] you can have that all prepared if you
[1:27:35] like if you're sitting down with
[1:27:36] somebody else
[1:27:37] and i'm not just going to say this is
[1:27:39] always how you need a witness you need
[1:27:41] to be led of the spirit of god
[1:27:42] but here in lies the approach to god
[1:27:46] and when people see because they go they
[1:27:49] might go around to different churches
[1:27:51] and go
[1:27:52] but this pastors these churches baptize
[1:27:54] in the father son holy spirit
[1:27:56] but you're telling me and then you've
[1:27:58] got
[1:27:59] this is the thing you're not always
[1:28:02] going to win every battle
[1:28:04] some people are going to follow their
[1:28:05] creed
[1:28:07] don't just pack up your bags and think
[1:28:08] i'm never going to do this again
[1:28:10] because there's plenty of them that will
[1:28:11] do that you see the gospel
[1:28:14] i think jesus said the gospel of the
[1:28:16] kingdom is likened unto
[1:28:17] a man that cast the net into the sea
[1:28:19] right and you cast the net in and you
[1:28:21] drag out and you get
[1:28:23] gum boots crabs craze and all
[1:28:26] we like eating the craze but you get a
[1:28:29] whole bunch of different things
[1:28:30] but there is some rainbow trout there
[1:28:33] are some rainbow trout in that
[1:28:34] pool and you gotta just keep pulling you
[1:28:36] gotta cast out the net
[1:28:38] and you're gonna get some rainbow trout
[1:28:41] but you see
[1:28:43] the post-resurrection fishing see the
[1:28:45] disciples
[1:28:47] they decided to go out peter says i go
[1:28:49] fishing right
[1:28:50] and see it they didn't catch nothing
[1:28:51] until they heard from the lord
[1:28:54] and under a prophetic vision of the lord
[1:28:57] when i say prophetic vision
[1:28:58] you don't have to be a prophet but the
[1:29:00] lord can speak to you right
[1:29:02] and when the lord speaks and inspires
[1:29:03] something to you it's prophetic
[1:29:05] because he's giving something it's
[1:29:07] inspiration and profess prophecy is to
[1:29:09] be
[1:29:10] inspired as the prophet says it's a
[1:29:12] double meaning word
[1:29:14] it can either mean inspiration or it can
[1:29:16] mean to tell foretell something
[1:29:18] but if the lord inspires something to
[1:29:20] you what you're doing is you're actually
[1:29:22] acting
[1:29:22] in a prophetic vision or you're acting
[1:29:24] under a prophetic
[1:29:26] inspiration from the lord and he's just
[1:29:28] shown you something or you might have a
[1:29:29] dream
[1:29:30] and that in that dream you're going to
[1:29:32] meet somebody
[1:29:33] and you're going to go and carry out
[1:29:35] then all of a sudden you find yourself
[1:29:36] living out that dream right
[1:29:38] that's like under a prophetic vision so
[1:29:39] here you have the disciples fishing and
[1:29:41] they can't catch nothing
[1:29:42] and maybe you've fished for many years
[1:29:44] and caught nothing but then
[1:29:46] just incline your air to the lord and
[1:29:47] say lord lord i want to catch something
[1:29:51] lord where's the rainbow trout lord you
[1:29:53] see taught the prophet how to fish
[1:29:55] huh he thought the prophet had a fish
[1:29:57] who knows the vision
[1:29:59] 1956 what is the vision i think and also
[1:30:02] why are people so tossed about
[1:30:03] two sermons should listen to them very
[1:30:05] good and in there he speaks about how
[1:30:08] the lord taught him the angel of the
[1:30:09] lord taught him how to fish
[1:30:10] and he says when he saw the rainbow
[1:30:12] trout in the lake he says i can catch
[1:30:14] those
[1:30:15] and i was like thank you lord i got
[1:30:17] caught
[1:30:19] amen this is the clear message right
[1:30:23] here
[1:30:24] you've you've got to have a clear
[1:30:26] message and the devil will try and pull
[1:30:28] you from that clear message
[1:30:30] but the clear message is the altar to
[1:30:33] approach god
[1:30:34] if somebody can get if you can get
[1:30:36] somebody to surrender their lives
[1:30:39] according to the bible right according
[1:30:42] to the bible
[1:30:42] it says repent and be baptized in the
[1:30:45] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:30:46] of your sins
[1:30:47] and that person in faith believes that
[1:30:50] jesus christ
[1:30:52] the lord jesus christ died and was
[1:30:54] buried
[1:30:55] and raised up the third day and they
[1:30:58] want to be identified with
[1:30:59] him and they take water baptism in the
[1:31:02] name of jesus christ repenting
[1:31:04] and they call on the lord and say lord
[1:31:06] you promised me
[1:31:08] to that i would receive the holy ghost
[1:31:10] and and
[1:31:12] the lord is obligated to his word to
[1:31:14] give them the holy spirit
[1:31:16] and and that's then the lord said that
[1:31:18] the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:31:20] is to lead you and guide you into all
[1:31:22] truth and so this
[1:31:24] is how god's elect will come this is how
[1:31:27] god
[1:31:27] you this this is a filter right because
[1:31:30] you can try this on everybody and not
[1:31:32] everyone's going to come not everyone's
[1:31:33] you might get a wet a wet cynic dry
[1:31:36] center come up a wet center because they
[1:31:38] haven't repented or whatever
[1:31:39] and they're just doing it out of some
[1:31:40] religious motion you see but when
[1:31:42] somebody is sincere
[1:31:44] and the lord has called them and he's
[1:31:46] worked on their heart and and they come
[1:31:47] the provided way
[1:31:49] you see what's going to happen is the
[1:31:51] devil's going to lose the fight because
[1:31:52] now they're going to come in here
[1:31:54] and they're going to get up in here and
[1:31:55] they're going to get on that altar and
[1:31:56] some fire is going to come down
[1:31:58] one day amen and they're going to come
[1:31:59] into the church and they're going to
[1:32:00] start hearing preaching and they're
[1:32:02] going to
[1:32:03] things are going to start happening and
[1:32:04] that seed is going to be activated
[1:32:07] but if you get caught up in and and your
[1:32:10] clear message gets distracted and gets
[1:32:12] distorted by something and profit this
[1:32:14] and that and everything
[1:32:16] there's a time out on the fields
[1:32:19] when we're out over and preaching in
[1:32:21] different countries and they're
[1:32:22] they're from denomination you can't
[1:32:24] quote the prophet
[1:32:26] now i'm not against quoting the prophet
[1:32:28] because we're going to quote the prophet
[1:32:29] quite a bit in a minute
[1:32:30] but you can't you just can't do that
[1:32:32] you've got to quote the bible
[1:32:34] you've got to bring everything that
[1:32:35] you've been that's been revealed in the
[1:32:37] scriptures
[1:32:38] because it's the scripture it's the
[1:32:40] bible it's the truth it's jesus christ
[1:32:42] that's going to bring right that's the
[1:32:44] word
[1:32:45] this is what the prophet brought this is
[1:32:47] using wisdom
[1:32:49] once they come in once they get the holy
[1:32:51] ghost
[1:32:52] you know once they really start
[1:32:53] something starts to happen inside and
[1:32:55] they see this is real
[1:32:56] and the lord starts working they'll be
[1:32:59] led to the truth
[1:33:00] amen amen
[1:33:03] and now this is your clear message your
[1:33:06] clear message is actually the lord
[1:33:08] it's not a bunch of doctrines and
[1:33:10] teachings the clear message
[1:33:12] is a declaration that he is here
[1:33:17] many years ago when it was in its
[1:33:20] infancy a story comes to mind
[1:33:22] that the british was going to take the
[1:33:23] commonwealth of this nation
[1:33:25] and there had been a group of men that
[1:33:27] had assembled themselves together and
[1:33:28] was on duty watching
[1:33:30] and there was a horse stood hitched and
[1:33:32] a rider ready to mount at any minute
[1:33:34] first thing he got was a sign that the
[1:33:35] british was coming and he straddled his
[1:33:37] horse
[1:33:38] what good would it do him to spur his
[1:33:40] horse what good would it do him to beat
[1:33:42] the horse
[1:33:43] and try to make his way from that church
[1:33:45] to boston what good would it done him if
[1:33:47] he didn't have a message to tell the
[1:33:48] people
[1:33:51] how would they know to prepare
[1:33:53] themselves
[1:33:55] our modern paul reveres has run well but
[1:33:58] they're just running there's no message
[1:34:01] the hour is here the crisis is on a
[1:34:04] world is at the end
[1:34:06] churches has met their climax nations
[1:34:08] has met their climax
[1:34:10] human life has met its climax science
[1:34:13] has met its climates
[1:34:14] everything has run out time has run out
[1:34:18] all of these things are just completely
[1:34:19] stale the devil's kingdom failed
[1:34:22] the devil is going and leaving this
[1:34:23] world soon with his tail between his
[1:34:25] legs
[1:34:26] that's his figure of speech but meaning
[1:34:29] he's failed and he's going to go out
[1:34:31] with a big big tantrum
[1:34:33] and he's in that tantrum right now but
[1:34:36] remember you're on the winning team
[1:34:38] you're on the winning team we've
[1:34:39] organized science has met its climax
[1:34:42] we've organized and made big churches
[1:34:44] polished our preachers and physically
[1:34:46] set them together that they know how to
[1:34:48] use their verbs and adverbs and their
[1:34:49] sounds and
[1:34:50] and all their vowels and everything just
[1:34:52] right in psychology
[1:34:53] to contact the people but that wasn't
[1:34:56] what jesus said
[1:34:59] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:35:01] they shall speak with new tongues if a
[1:35:03] deadly serpent would bite them that
[1:35:04] wouldn't harm them
[1:35:05] what is it they've gone and they've told
[1:35:10] they've gone and they've acted now i'm
[1:35:13] i'm encouraging you if you want
[1:35:16] mark 16 an action in your life go

[1:35:23] schoolmates
[1:35:23] go and tell somebody ask the lord give
[1:35:26] me someone to tell lord
[1:35:28] give me someone lord jesus to share
[1:35:31] this love and maybe you don't know that
[1:35:35] love
[1:35:36] tonight you can someone doesn't have the
[1:35:39] holy ghost tonight why don't you just
[1:35:40] surrender your life and get the holy
[1:35:42] ghost
[1:35:43] somebody here in this place just
[1:35:46] surrender your life
[1:35:47] could be your night to night
[1:35:52] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:35:54] shall recover the world needs a
[1:35:55] messenger
[1:35:56] with a message to tell something and
[1:35:59] know where the message come from
[1:36:01] and who it come from hallelujah
[1:36:04] amen we don't just want to go to people
[1:36:06] with a whole bunch of knowledge and
[1:36:07] quotes and theology
[1:36:08] but we've got a message and this is a
[1:36:11] person
[1:36:11] and he's get there to back you up so
[1:36:14] then you can have courage that if you
[1:36:17] are to talk to somebody
[1:36:19] you know that the lord the person the
[1:36:21] message that you have
[1:36:23] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:24] forever he's there to back up
[1:36:26] exactly and to come behind you and prove
[1:36:29] his word to his children
[1:36:34] we're going but with nothing to say
[1:36:38] it proves it now he's talking in general
[1:36:41] terms now
[1:36:42] to the church world so i'm not just
[1:36:44] meeting
[1:36:45] us as people here as individuals but
[1:36:48] this is a general
[1:36:50] where this is christianity without the
[1:36:53] holy ghost
[1:36:55] and substance this is a dangerous place
[1:36:57] to be but he says here
[1:36:58] we are going but with nothing to say it
[1:37:02] proves it
[1:37:02] when we come to a place that a nation or
[1:37:05] a people that denies jesus christ to be
[1:37:07] the son of god
[1:37:08] and stands in the face of our most
[1:37:10] challenging ministers of today
[1:37:12] and then in our great church league
[1:37:15] finding some 30 communists packing
[1:37:17] papers for 20 or 30 years that their
[1:37:20] members are that their members of the
[1:37:22] communist party
[1:37:24] and our united churches what can we do
[1:37:27] it shows they have run without a message
[1:37:30] selling out the very birthrights of the
[1:37:32] nation
[1:37:33] selling out the regular birthrights of
[1:37:36] the church
[1:37:38] and he says here it all has come to a
[1:37:41] showdown
[1:37:42] it has come to a place that the little
[1:37:44] church that's believed the message
[1:37:46] and stood on both feet with their eyes
[1:37:49] centered on the cross
[1:37:50] in their heart the resurrection of jesus
[1:37:53] christ
[1:37:54] burning amen is the resurrection burning

[1:38:06] that rose up out of the tomb is here the
[1:38:09] one

[1:38:20] fan is in his hands

[1:38:26] bit blocked up or some husks or
[1:38:27] something
[1:38:28] and it's time tonight to let the lord
[1:38:30] fan it

[1:38:40] faith

[1:39:38] we need if we could constantly labor for

[1:39:43] flesh be brought down low
[1:39:45] hallelujah amen
[1:39:49] hallelujah so yes it says here and this
[1:39:53] is the showdown right
[1:39:54] the showdown happens inside your own
[1:39:55] life as well as out there on the field
[1:39:58] and then you've got to stay dead reckon
[1:40:01] yourself
[1:40:02] as paul says in romans 6 reckon yourself
[1:40:06] to be dead indeed unto sin but alive
[1:40:08] unto god through jesus christ our lord
[1:40:10] amen
[1:40:10] what is he talking about being
[1:40:13] identified
[1:40:14] with the death burial and resurrection
[1:40:16] of the same
[1:40:17] jesus that is the same yesterday today
[1:40:19] and forever the very one that died
[1:40:22] and resurrected is here and he's saying
[1:40:24] i want you to be identified with me and
[1:40:26] he wants you to be a witness to go and
[1:40:28] tell
[1:40:28] that he's risen just as fresh as it was
[1:40:32] when mary magdalene was told
[1:40:33] just as fresh as when peter and john
[1:40:35] went to the tomb amen
[1:40:37] just as fresh the same one
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:50] where are we
[1:40:54] it has come to a showdown has come to a
[1:40:56] place that the little church that's
[1:40:57] believed the message and stood on both
[1:40:58] feet
[1:40:59] with their eyes centered on the cross in
[1:41:01] their heart the resurrection of jesus
[1:41:02] christ burning
[1:41:03] it's come to a place where the nation
[1:41:05] has got to recognize it
[1:41:07] it's to a showdown no wonder that the
[1:41:09] churches
[1:41:10] when the council of churches it's so
[1:41:12] honeycombed with communistic
[1:41:14] no wonder they can't believe in the
[1:41:15] supernatural no wonder they can't
[1:41:17] believe in divine healing
[1:41:18] they don't have any message in their
[1:41:21] heart
[1:41:23] oh my saints get the message in your
[1:41:25] heart
[1:41:26] hallelujah amen let it go from here
[1:41:29] and let it sink down only god can bring
[1:41:32] it from here down to here
[1:41:34] to take all that wonderful wonderful
[1:41:38] food
[1:41:39] you know like a you could say an eagle
[1:41:41] that's just caged up in
[1:41:43] their own ideas or just sit there and
[1:41:46] just hasn't broken through
[1:41:48] and it's just like brother brown says
[1:41:50] what's the use in having a canary bird
[1:41:51] that's
[1:41:52] got all the good food and all the oils
[1:41:54] and beautiful feathers and stuck in a
[1:41:56] cage
[1:41:57] and he says i just can't stand caging a
[1:41:59] bird
[1:42:00] you know a prophet that need had to soar
[1:42:04] in the heavenlies just couldn't stand it
[1:42:06] and he said but there's something far
[1:42:08] worse
[1:42:09] and that is a son or daughter of god
[1:42:12] that's stuck
[1:42:14] stuck and they're covered in good food
[1:42:16] and
[1:42:17] and good nutrition spiritual goodness
[1:42:19] and the outpouring of the spirit
[1:42:22] and messages that were stored up
[1:42:25] hallelujah and they're so healthy
[1:42:28] and yet not being used and yet out of
[1:42:31] not in full service amen because of some
[1:42:35] fear or something
[1:42:36] that's hindering the walk that could be
[1:42:39] so easily dealt with
[1:42:41] if we could just step back and say lord
[1:42:44] this is
[1:42:44] everything that's going on right now and
[1:42:47] i'm just going to take my hands off
[1:42:48] and say lord it's yours whatever you
[1:42:52] want lord
[1:42:53] whatever you have lord just lead me i'm
[1:42:56] neutral
[1:42:57] and then just start walking and say lord
[1:42:59] you lead me you know my heart
[1:43:01] the attitude it's not about physically
[1:43:04] doing nothing
[1:43:05] it's the attitude it's what is going on
[1:43:08] in the attitude this is what
[1:43:10] is all the focus the right mental
[1:43:12] attitude
[1:43:13] amen if the holy ghost comes into a
[1:43:15] man's heart he will believe that jesus
[1:43:17] christ is raised from the dead
[1:43:19] and he's alive in him
[1:43:25] to do and to do the will that he come to
[1:43:28] do
[1:43:28] the will the will of god through the
[1:43:30] man's life
[1:43:32] but the trouble we run we go without a
[1:43:34] message
[1:43:35] we go with theology amen
[1:43:38] we go with some kind of a church
[1:43:40] interpretation of the message
[1:43:43] he says scriptures but i'm going to say
[1:43:44] message for just this particular
[1:43:46] instance we go with an interpretation of
[1:43:49] the message
[1:43:50] but that's not going to get us anywhere
[1:43:53] but when you bring when
[1:43:55] the core is that people approach god in
[1:43:58] a biblical manner
[1:43:59] amen and give a clear message that the
[1:44:02] revelation of jesus christ
[1:44:04] he's unveiled he's arisen he's come
[1:44:08] amen in this end time to reveal himself
[1:44:10] in the full measure
[1:44:11] he's restored his church back this is
[1:44:13] the lord acting
[1:44:14] he's revealed himself the way he was
[1:44:16] before amen
[1:44:17] the way it was in the first church has
[1:44:19] been restored back again
[1:44:21] the lord promised these things and when
[1:44:23] you bring people through this in a
[1:44:24] simple way
[1:44:26] it blows them they go whoa
[1:44:29] it opens their eyes to see something
[1:44:31] that they were tunnel vision down here
[1:44:33] the devil's got people tunneled down
[1:44:34] onto this little track
[1:44:36] and they're walking this little track oh
[1:44:38] blessings and
[1:44:39] this little nice sermon at a church and
[1:44:41] a blessing here and this and that and
[1:44:42] they're all the way down here but really
[1:44:44] there's this
[1:44:45] whole thing and they don't even know
[1:44:48] they're just way down here in a little
[1:44:50] rut and there's all these little rivers
[1:44:52] of denominationalism
[1:44:53] and they're all just walking down there
[1:44:56] but there's this huge amazing thing
[1:44:58] but it comes with the right approach to
[1:44:59] god amen
[1:45:01] hallelujah amen all right it's getting a
[1:45:04] bit late now
[1:45:06] peter says for we have not followed
[1:45:08] cunningly devised fables when we made
[1:45:10] known unto you the power and coming of
[1:45:11] our lord jesus christ
[1:45:13] and this is what i'm talking about but
[1:45:15] there were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:45:17] for he received from god the father
[1:45:19] honor and glory
[1:45:20] for they came such a voice to him from
[1:45:21] the excellent glory this is my beloved
[1:45:23] son in whom i am well pleased
[1:45:25] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:45:27] heard when we were with him
[1:45:29] in the holy mount we have also a more
[1:45:31] sure word of prophecy
[1:45:33] amen where until you do well that you
[1:45:35] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:45:37] in a dark place
[1:45:39] until the day dawn and the day star
[1:45:40] arrives in your hearts
[1:45:42] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:45:44] the scripture is of any private
[1:45:45] interpretation
[1:45:47] you see as we sing god brings
[1:45:49] interpretation by bringing it to pass
[1:45:52] it's happening the interpretation of the
[1:45:54] scripture is the event
[1:45:56] thereof it's the unfolding of the will
[1:45:58] of god
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:04] i'm going to skip some of this brother
[1:46:06] brown says we've got to go with the
[1:46:08] resurrection
[1:46:09] go tell my disciples that i'll organize
[1:46:11] a new church no
[1:46:13] no he didn't say that he said go tell my
[1:46:15] disciples that i am risen from the dead
[1:46:18] hallelujah you know you if you might
[1:46:21] think that when i tell someone that
[1:46:23] that they've heard it before or that it
[1:46:25] sounds a bit outlandish for them
[1:46:27] but try it just try it
[1:46:30] my jesus is alive he's alive
[1:46:34] he's risen from the dead he truly has
[1:46:36] maybe god will anoint your words huh
[1:46:41] sorry i'm stealing your words brother
[1:46:43] maybe god will
[1:46:44] carry down on your words in that moment
[1:46:47] and change someone's life
[1:46:48] because you said something that you
[1:46:50] thought was too simple or too outlandish
[1:46:53] but just try it if we're hearing a word
[1:46:56] prophet
[1:46:57] say that we should do this i believe we
[1:46:59] should take heed
[1:47:01] and i'm i'm preaching to myself very
[1:47:03] much so right now
[1:47:05] because i think you know for many times
[1:47:06] but the law's really impressed upon my
[1:47:07] heart you know we need a witness
[1:47:09] but we need to have a clear message
[1:47:11] people need to know how to approach god
[1:47:14] this is what the devil's attacked do you
[1:47:16] think he couldn't wait
[1:47:18] to take the name of jesus out of the
[1:47:19] church he was so happy when that
[1:47:21] happened
[1:47:22] then he moved to take the bible out of
[1:47:23] the church too then he completely took
[1:47:25] everything out of the church that was
[1:47:26] true
[1:47:27] and it was dark it was just completely
[1:47:29] dark but god said i'll restore
[1:47:32] as he restored hello hello people that
[1:47:35] have entered in
[1:47:36] hello people that have met god how did
[1:47:38] you come in
[1:47:40] you went through the approach that
[1:47:41] elijah told you
[1:47:43] actually the bible told you that he just
[1:47:45] pointed you to the bible it was just all
[1:47:47] hidden away
[1:47:48] and when you found that approach that
[1:47:50] path you received the holy ghost
[1:47:53] so why not tell others if you're sitting
[1:47:57] here so happy
[1:47:58] and rejoicing what about those bride out
[1:48:00] there that are not rejoicing
[1:48:02] that are crying out for something real
[1:48:04] oh lord help me
[1:48:06] go and tell my bride
[1:48:09] that i've risen from the dead amen i
[1:48:13] mean
[1:48:13] you see that you get faced even the
[1:48:15] disciples didn't believe you know
[1:48:17] they thought my this is too much but the
[1:48:20] lord was gracious what did he do
[1:48:22] there was election there what did he do
[1:48:24] he worked with them
[1:48:25] he went behind mary and he said i'm
[1:48:26] gonna go and appear to these people
[1:48:28] and he went down and he he upgraded them
[1:48:30] he says oh look
[1:48:32] how come you're not believing he went
[1:48:35] all the way through the emmaus and told
[1:48:36] them and
[1:48:37] my see the lord will back up your words
[1:48:41] that's why i say now start with prayer
[1:48:43] amen i'm going to move really quick
[1:48:45] through these quotes i just i really
[1:48:47] have to get through a few quotes here
[1:48:48] that's the message to the church this
[1:48:50] morning that jesus
[1:48:52] is not dead he's alive and just as great
[1:48:56] just as great oh my
[1:49:00] just as powerful today as he ever was
[1:49:04] there's something in that revelation
[1:49:06] there's something about that
[1:49:08] when somebody can realize that and i've
[1:49:10] told it to hundreds
[1:49:12] hundreds and hundreds of people that
[1:49:14] jesus christ was the same yesterday
[1:49:15] today and forever
[1:49:17] that jesus christ the god of the bible i
[1:49:19] said and they might not have ever read a
[1:49:21] bible but
[1:49:21] most people know that there was a bible
[1:49:23] days right and i say
[1:49:24] the bible days are alive again the way
[1:49:27] that the new first church and if
[1:49:29] you're talking to religious realm then
[1:49:30] they do know a little bit
[1:49:32] half of them don't read the bible like
[1:49:34] we do like they don't even know the old
[1:49:36] testament stories or anything
[1:49:37] they just don't know that they're not
[1:49:39] they don't think to read it but
[1:49:41] when you say that we are the the that we
[1:49:44] have the book of acts
[1:49:45] that that we have felt worshipping
[1:49:47] according to the book of acts
[1:49:50] it does something yeah we're worshiping
[1:49:53] the same god and he's the same as he was
[1:49:55] and what you read in the bible that he
[1:49:57] did he he promised that we would do two
[1:49:59] and we do it it's the same
[1:50:03] jesus oh it says here there
[1:50:06] has been great messages but easter
[1:50:08] capped them all great messages
[1:50:10] easter was all of it when the dead
[1:50:14] was made preparation that last enemy
[1:50:18] we had seen sickness healed in the old
[1:50:20] testament we had seen miracles before in
[1:50:22] the old testament
[1:50:22] there were visions come in the old
[1:50:24] testament but every man
[1:50:26] went right to the grave wondering would
[1:50:28] he ever rise
[1:50:29] again but on easter morning when these
[1:50:32] disciples got the greatest message
[1:50:35] that any man could ever get what did
[1:50:37] they get

[1:50:42] disciples i

[1:50:51] death has been conquered death could not
[1:50:53] hold him
[1:50:54] there was enough anointing in that body
[1:50:57] in that life
[1:50:58] hallelujah that when he went down there
[1:51:02] the slimy hands of the devil couldn't
[1:51:04] hold him
[1:51:05] oh my the roman legion couldn't contain
[1:51:08] him
[1:51:09] amen there was an anointing amen
[1:51:12] hallelujah he says here there will never

[1:51:23] sickness by the spirit of god they could
[1:51:25] conquer time
[1:51:26] by the spirit of god they thought that
[1:51:28] was joshua
[1:51:30] and uh time of elijah i'm sorry uh azaya
[1:51:33] but they could conquer the time by the
[1:51:35] spirit of god and foresee things that
[1:51:37] was coming they could conquer that
[1:51:39] but never was there a man anointed with
[1:51:42] such an anointing from god
[1:51:44] that could make this statement i lay my
[1:51:47] life down
[1:51:48] and i'll take it up again oh this is the
[1:51:51] same god that's standing in the room

[1:52:11] and we're one of him oh my tear down
[1:52:14] this body i'll raise it on the third
[1:52:16] day there never was a man could make a
[1:52:18] statement like that
[1:52:19] and it was wondering in their hearts
[1:52:21] whether this would be true
[1:52:23] or not one time when they killed the
[1:52:26] prince of peace and put him in the grave
[1:52:27] and sealed up the tomb
[1:52:29] and death held him for three days and
[1:52:30] nights but on easter morning

[1:53:02] can lead you to his children
[1:53:04] god can lead you to people that need to
[1:53:06] hear the gospel
[1:53:07] that need to hear that jesus christ is
[1:53:09] alive that need to hear that he's risen
[1:53:11] need to hear that there's an anointed
[1:53:13] one a man here that could turn on the
[1:53:15] light
[1:53:16] that can change your life right now in a
[1:53:18] split second
[1:53:19] turn you from an unbeliever into a saint
[1:53:22] amen when they hear things like that
[1:53:26] people want love people want freedom
[1:53:28] people want life
[1:53:29] people want to have joy in their heart
[1:53:32] people want to live forever
[1:53:34] hallelujah i am the resurrection of life
[1:53:37] the strength of the lord
[1:53:39] is our consolation we have no other
[1:53:41] strength
[1:53:42] no other refuge have i none god have
[1:53:44] mercy take my life
[1:53:46] but never let me forget from whence
[1:53:48] cometh my
[1:53:49] strength it comes from the lord i don't
[1:53:52] want fine things of the world
[1:53:54] i want jesus i want his resurrection
[1:53:56] burning in my life
[1:53:58] oh i want that above all else
[1:54:02] nothing really matters unless i have
[1:54:04] that
[1:54:05] his resurrection burning in my life and
[1:54:08] as i said
[1:54:09] why not let him fan the flame why not
[1:54:12] let him
[1:54:12] fan the hust away why not let him blow
[1:54:15] on the carbon that's blocked out the
[1:54:17] light
[1:54:18] how different that was from jesus christ
[1:54:20] now he's talking in a comparison to
[1:54:22] napoleon
[1:54:23] see napoleon he conquered the world
[1:54:25] naturally and physically
[1:54:26] but he ended up a drunken wreck because
[1:54:29] he didn't play the game right
[1:54:31] the rules of the game of life were not
[1:54:33] played right
[1:54:34] because he forgot where his strength
[1:54:36] came from he forgot who was actually
[1:54:39] anointing him
[1:54:41] he should have given his life to god
[1:54:43] because it was god that prophesied that
[1:54:45] he would
[1:54:46] take that and conquer but he didn't play
[1:54:48] the game right
[1:54:50] but this one did our man our redeemer
[1:54:54] atkinson he played the game right
[1:54:57] as brother branham will say here how
[1:54:59] different that was from jesus christ at
[1:55:01] 33
[1:55:02] at the age of 33 jesus owned everything
[1:55:05] he made the world and he was in the
[1:55:07] world and the world knew him not
[1:55:10] he never made himself no reputation he
[1:55:12] never gathered no military man
[1:55:14] he never organized any churches he never
[1:55:17] made any
[1:55:18] great names for himself he never come
[1:55:20] forth with any boasting degrees of
[1:55:22] doctrine
[1:55:22] theology and so forth never had a record
[1:55:26] of him ever going into any school of
[1:55:28] theology
[1:55:29] but he had god he had god
[1:55:32] and at the age of 33 he had conquered
[1:55:35] every devil that stuck his head out of
[1:55:37] hell
[1:55:37] amen hello devil conquerors
[1:55:40] whenever a devil sticks his head out of
[1:55:42] hell you are caused to cast him out you
[1:55:46] have authority to cast them down
[1:55:48] amen you young children you've got
[1:55:51] authority
[1:55:52] to cast down the devil and he will stick
[1:55:55] his head up
[1:55:56] what are you gonna do stomp him down
[1:55:59] kick him down amen
[1:56:01] amen hallelujah what's that song we sing
[1:56:03] where we
[1:56:06] he's under my feet amen that's where he
[1:56:08] belongs hallelujah
[1:56:10] if he's not under your feet he's out of
[1:56:11] his place
[1:56:14] at the age of 33 it conquered every
[1:56:16] devil that stuck his head out of hell
[1:56:17] he conquered sickness he conquered
[1:56:19] superstitions
[1:56:20] he conquered devils he conquered death
[1:56:23] and when he died at the cross he
[1:56:24] descended into the bottomless pits of
[1:56:26] hell
[1:56:26] and conquered hell hallelujah and on
[1:56:29] easter morning he conquered the grave
[1:56:31] why because he played the rules of the
[1:56:33] game right running with the message
[1:56:36] he was he was gone go god sent
[1:56:40] him and he had a message to tell them
[1:56:42] and with the message that god gave him
[1:56:44] he conquered the powers of satan he
[1:56:47] conquered sickness
[1:56:48] he conquered death he conquered hell he
[1:56:51] conquered the grave why
[1:56:52] he went he went he went
[1:56:57] he went go
[1:57:00] don't stay don't do nothing
[1:57:03] years ago and didn't brother ben preach
[1:57:06] on sunday
[1:57:07] i hear the sound of it going we're going
[1:57:11] amen so we need to go and tell
[1:57:15] tell the people we're about to leave
[1:57:19] hallelujah there's a rapture going to
[1:57:22] happen soon
[1:57:23] amen let's say this is stage two of your
[1:57:26] witness
[1:57:26] once they've come through stage one
[1:57:28] we're leaving
[1:57:30] don't tell them we're leaving straight
[1:57:31] away they might think you're real crazy
[1:57:32] then
[1:57:33] but you know when they really start to
[1:57:34] walk with the lord amen
[1:57:36] now you tell them like this is a going
[1:57:38] message we're not here to just stay
[1:57:40] around
[1:57:40] we're going to leave this earth amen
[1:57:42] just like jesus was anointed to take up
[1:57:44] his life again
[1:57:45] no man could say that but you are
[1:57:48] anointed
[1:57:48] to be raptured you're anointed to never
[1:57:51] taste death
[1:57:52] no man has ever been able to say that i
[1:57:54] am anointed
[1:57:55] to never taste death but you and me
[1:57:59] are anointed to be raptured out of this
[1:58:01] place
[1:58:02] amen do you believe that amen do you
[1:58:05] receive it
[1:58:06] in your heart i am anointed to never
[1:58:10] taste death
[1:58:11] i will be raptured out of here by the
[1:58:13] grace of my god
[1:58:15] hallelujah then before he died he said
[1:58:17] this
[1:58:18] even as the father sent me so send i you
[1:58:21] not to build men by military strength
[1:58:23] not to put all your time and who will be
[1:58:25] president
[1:58:25] that might be essential but it's not
[1:58:28] essential
[1:58:28] in this oh
[1:58:32] this world is gone we've got one message
[1:58:36] that is jesus christ raised from the
[1:58:39] dead
[1:58:40] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:58:43] forever
[1:58:44] what was the theme of the message jesus
[1:58:48] christ the same yesterday today
[1:58:51] and forever and sometimes we just need
[1:58:53] to get down on our knees and say lord
[1:58:55] reveal that to me let that become real
[1:58:58] to me
[1:58:59] let me know that you're the same lord
[1:59:01] not just the same in your own self but
[1:59:03] the same in myself
[1:59:05] amen i want this to be personal
[1:59:08] i don't just want everyone else to
[1:59:10] rejoice i want to rejoice
[1:59:12] i want to have a good time too i want to
[1:59:14] laugh all the way to the bank as they
[1:59:16] say
[1:59:16] amen heaven is the bank i want to
[1:59:20] rejoice all the way there
[1:59:21] i don't want to be miserable all the way
[1:59:23] there we'll have our moments
[1:59:24] we need them we need our valleys
[1:59:29] but let's rejoice no matter where we are
[1:59:32] amen hallelujah we're nearly there
[1:59:36] and because the message is right because
[1:59:38] god sent the message
[1:59:40] because god sent the messenger no doubt
[1:59:42] that every gun of hell will be firing at
[1:59:44] him
[1:59:44] that's right he'll stumble and fall and
[1:59:46] get up and shake his head
[1:59:47] and go on that's the key it's not him
[1:59:50] that falls
[1:59:51] it's him gets back up and continues on
[1:59:54] and then
[1:59:56] upon this we got shake his head and go
[1:59:58] on we got a message
[2:00:00] nothing is going to stop it hallelujah
[2:00:02] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[2:00:04] the gates of hell will never
[2:00:06] prevail against it they can say what
[2:00:08] they want to do
[2:00:09] they can do what they want to the devil
[2:00:11] can rage and hell
[2:00:12] but jesus raised from the dead he lives
[2:00:15] today in us
[2:00:16] a few days ago talking to the great dr
[2:00:18] lamza
[2:00:19] who translated the bible from aramaic
[2:00:22] unto english
[2:00:23] and i seen that little sign god sign on
[2:00:26] there
[2:00:26] with the three little dots in it i said
[2:00:29] dr lamsa
[2:00:30] what is that he said
[2:00:33] it's god with three attributes and i
[2:00:36] said you mean
[2:00:37] god living in three offices such as
[2:00:39] father son
[2:00:40] and holy ghost he raised and looked at
[2:00:43] me
[2:00:44] tears come in that jew's eyes he said
[2:00:47] do you believe that brother branham and
[2:00:49] i said with all that's within my heart
[2:00:51] he throwed his arms around me and said i
[2:00:53] wondered when i seen there those great
[2:00:56] things going forth and the signs that
[2:00:57] you were doing
[2:00:58] i said that they told me you was a
[2:01:00] prophet i didn't
[2:01:01] believe it until now now i know you are
[2:01:05] he said that's it that's the message
[2:01:08] that's the thing that will shape the
[2:01:10] kingdom of god
[2:01:11] is the revelation of who jesus christ is
[2:01:15] amen lord help us to reveal who jesus
[2:01:18] christ is
[2:01:19] not just by what we say but by what we
[2:01:22] do our life is a revelation
[2:01:24] the wife is a revelation of the husband
[2:01:28] has anyone heard that before the wife
[2:01:31] is the husband revealed so the
[2:01:34] condition of the church is the
[2:01:36] revelation
[2:01:37] of jesus christ and so if that church is
[2:01:40] completely yielded to jesus christ
[2:01:42] and he's living in her then she will
[2:01:44] reveal him
[2:01:46] and in the natural the condition of the
[2:01:48] wife
[2:01:49] will reveal the condition of the husband
[2:01:51] in many
[2:01:52] aspects not in every case but in many
[2:01:55] aspects
[2:01:56] in a good healthy christian marriage the
[2:01:59] wife will be the revelation of the
[2:02:02] husband
[2:02:04] that could be very challenging or you
[2:02:06] could be rejoicing right now
[2:02:10] that's probably a touchy subject no no
[2:02:12] one's saying amen or nothing
[2:02:14] hey we're just very technically quite
[2:02:16] quiet right now
[2:02:18] do you believe that brother branham and
[2:02:19] he says yes and they this
[2:02:21] guy was rejoicing this thing will shake
[2:02:23] the kingdom of god
[2:02:24] this everything i'm reading is pretty
[2:02:26] much out of go tell
[2:02:27] so there's a reason why the prophet
[2:02:30] would bring these stories out he would
[2:02:32] bring out about the freedom from slavery
[2:02:34] he would bring out about all of these
[2:02:36] things that that
[2:02:37] that calvary that the resurrection would
[2:02:39] do
[2:02:40] that the atonement would do because this
[2:02:43] is what
[2:02:43] matters to bring a person into the
[2:02:46] kingdom
[2:02:47] is to unite them in the atonement
[2:02:50] atonement means at one minute with god
[2:02:54] that's where they made the word up
[2:02:56] that's an english made word
[2:02:57] to describe a hebrew word which i have
[2:02:59] no idea but
[2:03:01] it means at one minute so
[2:03:04] the we are in our core
[2:03:07] calling as ministers of reconciliation
[2:03:11] we are called to reconcile people to god
[2:03:15] we are called to bring people to the
[2:03:17] atonement
[2:03:18] and this is why in go tell the prophet
[2:03:21] centers around the revelation of who
[2:03:24] jesus christ is
[2:03:25] and that he's unchanging and that he's
[2:03:27] alive and that he's doing the same
[2:03:29] things
[2:03:29] but also the benefits of knowing that
[2:03:33] because when someone knows that that
[2:03:36] brings deliverance
[2:03:37] that brings freedom that takes the slave
[2:03:39] belt of sin of their life that gives
[2:03:42] them
[2:03:42] speaking terms with god and if you tell
[2:03:45] someone
[2:03:46] who doesn't know god and thinks he's
[2:03:47] some far out thing
[2:03:49] and you say i have
[2:03:53] i can impart you
[2:03:56] the blood of jesus christ to you and put
[2:03:58] you on speaking terms with god
[2:04:00] and there's an election in their heart
[2:04:03] don't you think that they're going to
[2:04:04] want to know more now i'm talking now
[2:04:06] these are examples
[2:04:08] you want to be led by the spirit you
[2:04:10] want god to inspire you
[2:04:11] you want god to be the you want these to
[2:04:14] be divine appointments
[2:04:15] but you see you've got to ask for them
[2:04:18] you need to be willing
[2:04:20] and if you're in a condition where you
[2:04:22] are asking you'll have an expectation
[2:04:25] and then that person that walks past you
[2:04:27] the ask question
[2:04:29] you're instant in season and out of
[2:04:31] season because you're in a mode
[2:04:33] it's a whole thought process change you
[2:04:35] see we're busy
[2:04:37] we're out there we're doing our thing
[2:04:39] we're just gunning it
[2:04:40] and we're this and that and everything
[2:04:42] else and then when you see
[2:04:43] then there's a need there but you just
[2:04:45] can't stop because you're too busy
[2:04:47] but if you're in that mode and you
[2:04:49] realize
[2:04:51] you know if i tithe my life right now
[2:04:53] that thing that i need to do will god
[2:04:55] will help
[2:04:56] just like when the prophet went to the
[2:04:58] woman aunt jemima
[2:05:00] she grounded a plane with her face maybe
[2:05:02] that person that you passed by
[2:05:04] grounded your car with her faith
[2:05:07] and maybe you just need to stop a little
[2:05:09] bit and say lord here i
[2:05:10] am lord let get in get
[2:05:14] come to a mode in your life with the
[2:05:16] lord where
[2:05:17] you can hear his voice again where you
[2:05:19] can hear that still small voice
[2:05:21] you see if the prophet was probably all
[2:05:23] stressed out too busy
[2:05:25] maybe the lord wouldn't he wouldn't have
[2:05:26] heard the voice of god saying walk that
[2:05:28] way
[2:05:29] and you see but he was tuned in
[2:05:32] he was tuned to the voice of god
[2:05:35] and this is where we need to be saints
[2:05:38] tuned
[2:05:39] to the voice of god hallelujah
[2:05:43] it starts with prayer help me lord
[2:05:47] let's just keep us really really simple
[2:05:49] and attainable
[2:05:51] it's his grace it's not our performance
[2:05:52] it's not our ability
[2:05:54] it's saying lord help me i actually want
[2:05:56] that
[2:05:57] i want that i i don't want to try and
[2:06:00] work myself into something or you know
[2:06:02] we get in a mode like because of the
[2:06:03] university in school we're going to earn
[2:06:05] that
[2:06:05] that certificate we've got to earn that
[2:06:07] masters and paul
[2:06:08] we've got to we're going to work hard
[2:06:10] for that thing oh my
[2:06:12] we're going to stress out jeremy if
[2:06:13] you're watching this
[2:06:15] we're gonna really study up hard but you
[2:06:18] see
[2:06:19] this is different this is lord i can't
[2:06:22] do it
[2:06:23] lord i need you lord jesus i can't be a
[2:06:27] good witness
[2:06:28] i'm afraid to go and talk to a stranger
[2:06:30] but lord will help me
[2:06:32] i need your help lord that's just being
[2:06:35] like a child this is just as come as a
[2:06:36] little child
[2:06:38] i believe the resurrection of jesus
[2:06:40] christ raised from the dead and he was
[2:06:42] the only man could say that all powers
[2:06:43] in heaven and earth is given unto me
[2:06:46] all powers into my hand all powers in
[2:06:49] heaven earth has given unto my hand go
[2:06:50] ye into all the world and preach the
[2:06:52] gospel to every creature
[2:06:53] the gospel came not in word only but
[2:06:55] through the power and demonstrations of
[2:06:57] the holy ghost
[2:06:58] god help you to believe that god help me
[2:07:00] to believe that
[2:07:01] and we will see jesus someday
[2:07:05] that's that lumza thing that's the sign
[2:07:08] there
[2:07:10] i have no idea kind of what it really
[2:07:11] means but he says it's like the fire of
[2:07:13] god and here's the
[2:07:14] father son and holy spirit all in one
[2:07:16] attribute of god
[2:07:20] amen let's stand up the musicians please
[2:07:23] and we will
[2:07:24] i don't even want to look at the time
[2:07:28] we're not too bad
[2:07:29] [Laughter]
[2:07:32] amen is there anybody in here
[2:07:36] that wants to ask the lord to
[2:07:40] help them be a witness
[2:07:44] if there's somebody in here that just
[2:07:46] wants to have more courage
[2:07:49] let's think of this meeting because
[2:07:52] remember the heathen's raging out there
[2:07:54] and there's attacks on every front out
[2:07:56] there and the devil's right there trying
[2:07:57] to stop it
[2:07:59] would don't you think that if the devil
[2:08:01] can stop us
[2:08:02] from being a witness that he can just
[2:08:04] take a little bit more longer right
[2:08:06] this is his idea he wants to stop right
[2:08:08] as much as he can
[2:08:09] i mean unbelief cannot hinder the
[2:08:11] purpose of god but
[2:08:12] you see let's
[2:08:15] when the disciples first began right
[2:08:19] and they were having all sorts of
[2:08:20] troubles but then
[2:08:22] you know they got attacked by the
[2:08:25] councils and their sanhedrins and
[2:08:26] everything
[2:08:28] but you see the devil was trying to
[2:08:31] provoke them to fear
[2:08:33] he was trying to thwart them and they
[2:08:34] said if you don't even
[2:08:36] preach or teach in the name of jesus see
[2:08:40] because they raised that man the lame
[2:08:42] man at the temple
[2:08:44] they raised them out of the lame
[2:08:46] condition
[2:08:47] all his life and it got the devil raging
[2:08:50] so they were now in the upper room or
[2:08:52] wherever that room was
[2:08:53] amen and you see when they were in that
[2:08:55] room
[2:08:56] and they were they were they were
[2:08:58] threatened they
[2:09:00] called on the name of the lord together
[2:09:02] and the lord came down and shook the
[2:09:03] room
[2:09:04] and they said give us boldness lord
[2:09:07] to to go out there and preach your word
[2:09:08] and grant that mighty signs and wonders
[2:09:10] will be done in the name of your son
[2:09:12] jesus christ
[2:09:13] who knows the story right acts chapter
[2:09:15] four and so tonight
[2:09:17] um we'll sing a song and then we just
[2:09:19] pray i just want you to just pray and
[2:09:21] let's just
[2:09:22] believe the same god that shook that
[2:09:24] room the same god that gave him boldness
[2:09:26] can give us boldness because you see
[2:09:29] let's not think of this as just another
[2:09:31] sermon but let's think of this
[2:09:33] as a commission this is a commission to
[2:09:37] do the final last
[2:09:38] part of the mission you are called in
[2:09:41] the final
[2:09:42] move in the final voice to the final age
[2:09:45] and this
[2:09:46] is the last stand before we go
[2:09:49] and i don't know how many years or days
[2:09:51] it might be but
[2:09:52] you see there needs to be a witness in
[2:09:54] the face of death in the face of fear in
[2:09:56] the face of humiliation in the face of
[2:09:58] persecution
[2:09:59] there must be a witness and hello you
[2:10:02] are it i'm it we are it and therefore we
[2:10:06] need boldness
[2:10:08] amen we need to be in a condition where
[2:10:11] when we're busy we can still hear the
[2:10:12] voice of god
[2:10:13] and be willing to stop and and and
[2:10:16] minister
[2:10:16] like the good samaritan amen let us pray
[2:10:20] um do you want to play a song is there
[2:10:21] anyone that thinks of a song that's kind
[2:10:23] of related
[2:10:25] isaac you're normally good at this a
[2:10:27] have you got a song bro
[2:10:32] yeah let's do go uh yep go tell john
[2:10:36] we'll do go tell john but let's just
[2:10:38] just play it and
[2:10:39] we'll just pray
[2:10:46] lord jesus father
[2:10:49] lord we are just needing lord jesus
[2:10:52] father you
[2:10:53] to take these words
[2:10:57] and this commission lord that you spoke
[2:11:00] i'm just resounding lord what you've
[2:11:01] already said lord
[2:11:03] what your prophet elijah spoke in this
[2:11:06] generation lord
[2:11:08] and and that's momentous sermon go and
[2:11:11] tell
[2:11:12] for father you knew lord the pressures
[2:11:14] that we would face
[2:11:15] in society and in our own lives in the
[2:11:18] personal way lord
[2:11:20] we all want to be accepted we all want
[2:11:22] to be liked and we want to be loved
[2:11:26] and whatever group that we find
[2:11:27] ourselves in whether it's secular
[2:11:30] spiritual blood family social
[2:11:33] professional whatever groups we find
[2:11:35] ourselves in lord
[2:11:36] we want to be accepted but lord to be a
[2:11:39] witness father
[2:11:41] it does come at as cost lord and the
[2:11:43] cost is
[2:11:44] to suffer the reproach for the cause of
[2:11:47] christ
[2:11:48] and lord jesus father i pray that we
[2:11:51] would feel
[2:11:52] and experience the crying of the spirit
[2:11:54] in our heart
[2:11:55] lord that we could feel and experience
[2:11:58] the burden
[2:11:59] of the holy ghost and how you are
[2:12:02] dying to be reunited how you died and
[2:12:05] rose again
[2:12:06] to be reunited how lord your flesh was
[2:12:09] ripped apart
[2:12:09] and to symbolize the veil being rent
[2:12:13] the veil of the badger skin being ripped
[2:12:16] down from top to bottom
[2:12:17] just like it was when it hung between
[2:12:20] heaven and earth
[2:12:21] the veil of your flesh was ripped from
[2:12:23] top
[2:12:24] to bottom until you were unrecognizable
[2:12:26] lord
[2:12:27] if that's the cost lord hanging naked on
[2:12:31] a cross
[2:12:32] unrecognizable bones showing from the
[2:12:34] torture
[2:12:35] and the blood and the thorn crown brow
[2:12:38] and yet you looked
[2:12:39] through those bloody eyelids that were
[2:12:41] probably not even intact lord
[2:12:43] and the nose that was probably broken
[2:12:45] over and spit hanging down your face
[2:12:48] you looked with compassion down and you
[2:12:50] said father
[2:12:52] forgive them for you they know not what
[2:12:54] they do lord and
[2:12:55] and father lord you turned to the left
[2:12:58] and you saw that faith hanging
[2:13:00] on your right o lord jesus and you
[2:13:03] looked with compassion
[2:13:04] and you said today you shall be with me
[2:13:07] in paradise
[2:13:08] lord you were never too busy lord jesus
[2:13:11] to reach out to that lost soul
[2:13:13] to that one lord jesus that needed
[2:13:15] healing
[2:13:16] touch of jesus christ and father tonight
[2:13:19] lord i pray
[2:13:20] that lord we would follow suit
[2:13:23] i pray lord that you would grant that
[2:13:26] you
[2:13:26] would give us boldness tonight lord
[2:13:29] boldness
[2:13:30] father and courage i pray lord jesus
[2:13:34] lord that you would lead us to your
[2:13:36] elected seed
[2:13:38] father that you would put your words in
[2:13:40] our mouth
[2:13:41] and give us a revelation of what
[2:13:45] i believe you put on my heart to express
[2:13:47] tonight
[2:13:48] and i believe lord it's very difficult
[2:13:50] for me to express in words
[2:13:52] the revelation and the burden of my
[2:13:55] heart that you placed in their lord
[2:13:56] about the clear message lord but father
[2:13:59] lord it doesn't matter how good my words
[2:14:01] are lord
[2:14:02] it matters lord that your word was
[2:14:04] preached lord and i pray that you would
[2:14:05] take your word
[2:14:07] not my word but your word lord and
[2:14:09] anchor it in every heart of ours lord
[2:14:11] that lord be in the magnitude of it lord
[2:14:14] lord jesus father the burden of the
[2:14:16] spirit we would experience lord

[2:14:21] lost

[2:14:29] to wave off all the husks and anything
[2:14:31] lord that's not of you lord
[2:14:33] to reveal only the golden grain that's
[2:14:35] ripening in the sunlight
[2:14:37] for we know lord that the grain is gold
[2:14:40] lord it was green
[2:14:41] father 50 old years ago lord but we were
[2:14:44] told by a prophet lord that

[2:15:04] fanning tonight
[2:15:05] and i ask lord jesus in the name of
[2:15:08] jesus christ
[2:15:09] that you would send the wind of the holy
[2:15:11] spirit to blow out those husts
[2:15:13] of fear and unsurety and lord unbelief
[2:15:17] and doubt
[2:15:18] and lord may lord you reveal the more
[2:15:22] sure word of prophecy that we have
[2:15:23] received
[2:15:25] that we may declare that you are alive
