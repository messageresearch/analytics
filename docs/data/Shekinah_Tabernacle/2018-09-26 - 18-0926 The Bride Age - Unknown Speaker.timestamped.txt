[35:05] you got the Bible handy I mean let's go
[35:09] to the book of John amen
[35:21] so we're going to read we're going to
[35:24] read from John 11 like we did on Sunday
[35:27] they were gonna go to revelations
[35:28] chapter 3 so we're going to read from
[35:31] John 11 and verses 25 down to verse 29
[35:34] and then we're going to go to
[35:35] revelations 3 read verses 20 to 22 so
[35:39] John 11 and 25 says here jesus saith
[35:45] unto her speaking to martha i am the
[35:47] resurrection and the life he that
[35:48] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[35:50] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[35:53] believeth in me shall never die
[35:55] believeth Elvis and she said unto Him
[35:58] yay Lord I believe that thou art the
[36:00] Christ the Son of God which you come
[36:02] into the world and when she had so said
[36:05] she went her way and called marry her
[36:06] sister secretly saying the master has
[36:09] come and calleth for thee as soon as she
[36:12] heard that she arose quickly and went
[36:15] unto Him amen and let's go to
[36:17] revelations chapter 3 and verses 20 to
[36:23] 22 or heed from actually let's read from
[36:30] verse 9
[36:31] sorry 19 revelations 3 and 19 for as
[36:34] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[36:36] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[36:39] stand at the door and knock If any man
[36:40] hear my voice and open the door I will
[36:43] come in to him and will sup with him and
[36:46] he with me to him that overcometh will I
[36:48] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[36:50] as also I overcame and AM sit down it
[36:54] with my father and his
[36:55] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[36:57] the spirit saith unto the churches
[37:00] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[37:02] his word you may have your seats this
[37:03] night I want to I want to kind of
[37:07] continue on and away from from Sunday
[37:10] but I want to speak about the day now in
[37:13] which we live and I trust that it'll be
[37:17] a blessing to you
[37:19] now when he read I just want to I just
[37:21] want to take a couple of just just
[37:23] background pieces from because we're
[37:25] going to move through the scripture a
[37:26] bit but we read in John as we as I spoke
[37:29] about on Sunday that there was the
[37:32] gathering of the Living Bride which is a
[37:34] representative Mary and Martha they were
[37:36] gathered to the son of man and when they
[37:38] were gathered to the son of man in the
[37:39] resurrection of the dead in Christ
[37:41] Lazarus happen so there's a gathering of
[37:43] the Living Bride and then the
[37:46] resurrection of the Dead Saints now we
[37:48] read in revelations 3 so basically what
[37:51] I'm going to show you now is brother
[37:53] Brown speaks of the bride age he says
[37:55] we're not a we're not a Pentecostal were
[37:56] not on the Pentecostal age anymore we're
[37:58] now in a bride age so I want to go and
[38:00] speak about what he's referring to so
[38:04] that's where I'm going to go if you're
[38:06] wondering where this is where this is
[38:07] going now so revelations 3 we read there
[38:11] that the that that God is commanding as
[38:16] many as he loves to be zealous therefore
[38:18] and repent and that's the only and if
[38:23] you read the whole chapter from verses
[38:25] 14 down to verse 22 speaks of the age we
[38:27] live in
[38:28] he doesn't give any good thing to say
[38:30] about this age it's all bad but then he
[38:32] says be zealous as many as I love be
[38:34] zealous therefore and repent but then he
[38:36] says now behold I stand at the door and
[38:38] knock so Christ is on the outside of his
[38:41] church so that so for the first time in
[38:43] two thousand years he has actually
[38:45] kicked out of the age so he is not in
[38:48] the church system anymore he's been
[38:50] kicked out so now but then he says If
[38:53] any man hear my voice so so there's a
[38:55] voice of God to this age which we know
[38:57] is the message of the hour God has
[38:59] spoken in this age of any man hear that
[39:01] voice any person hear that voice and
[39:03] open the door then I will come into him
[39:06] and and will sup with him and he with me
[39:09] we will have communion we will become
[39:11] one right so so there's a call for four
[39:15] he's on the outside and we're going to
[39:18] go into how that happened and then and
[39:20] then there's a call to for people to
[39:23] open the door and become one with Jesus
[39:25] Christ just like Mary Martha came to
[39:28] Mary and said you know behold the master
[39:30] cometh and calleth for thee so there's a
[39:32] call to come one with him there's a call
[39:35] to come out from wherever you are and
[39:37] become one with him right and to him
[39:39] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[39:41] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[39:42] and I'm sit down with my father and his
[39:45] throne so what happens now in this age
[39:48] that we live as this as this Christ has
[39:51] manifested upon the earth the Son of Man
[39:53] is revealed but the church system turns
[39:55] him down like they did in his first
[39:57] coming and so he's kicked out so now
[39:59] he's standing at door knocking trying to
[40:01] get back in calling that as bride will
[40:03] come out that's why these are called in
[40:05] this hour come out from among them and
[40:07] be separate saith the Lord is a call
[40:09] come out of her my people so so there
[40:12] has to be their call and there has to be
[40:14] a people that are predestinated to
[40:16] respond to that call I mean and and I I
[40:19] trust when I say that you said well
[40:21] that's me I mean he's called me out I've
[40:23] heard his voice I'll become one with him
[40:25] now when we talk about ages ago we
[40:29] talked about the Ephesians
[40:30] you know the seven churches I'll just
[40:32] define it in this way and age is defined
[40:35] as where God is working he was in the
[40:37] Ephesian age and then he moved into the
[40:39] next stage then he moved into the next
[40:41] stage he wasn't back in the first age
[40:43] anymore he had moved on so wherever God
[40:46] is that's the age where he is
[40:48] manifesting himself now so the world we
[40:51] know the lady I see in church age
[40:53] started with the word yo around 1906
[40:56] with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at
[40:58] Azusa Street and the letter C and H
[41:00] started but now there came a time so God
[41:03] was working there but then he became
[41:05] fully manifested in this hour the church
[41:08] system turned him down so he was kicked
[41:10] out they took Creed's and dogmas they
[41:12] took like Barabbas they received
[41:13] Barabbas at the first crucifixion and
[41:15] crucified Jesus just like the church
[41:17] world system takes a spirit of a
[41:19] murderer above the spirit of Christ and
[41:21] so so
[41:23] now he's kicked out so where's God
[41:25] dealing now he's not dealing in the
[41:26] church systems anymore but he's not
[41:28] dealing outside the church systems
[41:30] calling a bride so that's why so now the
[41:33] world is still in a later seeing
[41:34] condition right but the bride has called
[41:37] out into what brother brown referred to
[41:38] as a bride age right with a bride as
[41:41] call that and God is now dealing in the
[41:43] in his bride right so so even with me so
[41:47] far clothes right and we know that just
[41:50] like in any change in dispensation you
[41:52] know just like the Jews Jesus came to
[41:55] his own but his own received him not a
[41:57] few did but then you read the book of
[42:00] Acts it starts off with all Jews then
[42:02] there comes a time with Paul and Silas
[42:04] they said seeing you find yourself
[42:06] unworthy of eternal life we turn to the
[42:08] Gentiles see there's an overlap season
[42:10] where the Jews are slowly being blinded
[42:12] and the eyes of the Gentiles are being
[42:14] open so both Ages were overlapping one
[42:17] was phasing out and one was phasing in
[42:19] right and there's the same thing all the
[42:21] way down through the ages you see the
[42:23] Ephesian age slowly phases out the next
[42:25] h phases in just like with the latest in
[42:28] the Philadelphian age the age of
[42:29] brotherly love the great missionary age
[42:31] and the lady ascend age one one was
[42:34] overlapping in together later C an age
[42:35] was phasing in and the Philadelphian was
[42:38] phasing out right and then now we come
[42:40] down to here where the letter C at age
[42:43] God as God has been kicked out of that
[42:45] age which he has been and then now we
[42:47] started to opened up a bride age right
[42:50] so now God is now dealing in a bride age
[42:53] now brother Bram says I'm just going to
[42:55] make a I'm going to read this from the
[42:57] modern events made clear by prophecy he
[42:59] says but now there's got to be something
[43:02] that cannot be denominated it's the
[43:05] entirety of the life that's in there has
[43:07] to produce itself again on a bride
[43:10] there cannot be any more church ages
[43:12] after this were at the end brothers and
[43:13] sisters we're here we've arrived
[43:15] thanks be to God Amen now we see these
[43:18] things that just as true as they can be
[43:21] sorry there isn't that's from the seed
[43:23] is not here with a shook now and modern
[43:25] the beans made clear by prophecy he says
[43:27] we're not living in a Pentecostal age
[43:28] we're living in another age see we're
[43:31] not living in a Methodist age we're
[43:32] living in another age we're living on up
[43:35] here to the bride age the
[43:37] falling out of the church and getting it
[43:39] together for the rapture that's the age
[43:41] we're now living - my honest opinion
[43:43] that's exactly the truth now when
[43:46] brother baron when you when you go and
[43:47] listen to what he says you know when he
[43:49] speaks about now we're not back in the
[43:51] Lutheran Age or the or the Methodists
[43:53] age of the Pentecostal age he doesn't he
[43:55] doesn't do away with what happened in
[43:57] those ages God was moving in those ages
[44:00] God was calling his elect but he said
[44:02] it's a rebuilding of the of the second
[44:06] eighth so Jesus is the second Adam but
[44:09] he has to have a woman a church that
[44:11] now's the feminist part of himself so
[44:13] everything he is she becomes so he is
[44:15] the word she becomes the word right so
[44:18] you know we know on the day of Pentecost
[44:20] a church was birthed and you see a quick
[44:22] maturity a quick display the life of
[44:24] Christ and a group of people but it fell
[44:26] eventually decrees and dogmas of men so
[44:29] the sick and Eve fell there to the
[44:31] Creed's and dogmas of man till it was
[44:32] buried eventually in the dark ages but
[44:34] then it become to come back because God
[44:36] promised I will restore soon he sent
[44:38] Martin Luther with the Reformation and
[44:40] that opened up some of the light of the
[44:42] truth of the scripture but then that
[44:45] wasn't that was just the beginning it
[44:46] wasn't the end right so just like if you
[44:49] plant plant wheat or any kind of crop as
[44:52] soon as the little your leaf comes out
[44:54] you don't say well I've got my wheat
[44:56] it's got to grow it's got a mature it's
[44:58] going to become golden the seed that was
[45:00] planted has to be reproduced again right
[45:03] so so they're cast to come a process of
[45:05] time where the grain is here in the
[45:08] greenness here at the end there's not
[45:09] another church age after this right
[45:11] there's not a you know we're not looking
[45:13] for something to come it's already here
[45:15] all the power everything Jesus purchased
[45:18] for us bride at Calvary is loosed it's
[45:20] been put upon the earth we're not
[45:22] looking for another word to come we've
[45:24] received a full word rights and we know
[45:26] God does not take away he adds so he
[45:29] said Luther with justification the just
[45:31] shall live by faith
[45:32] when wisly came with the second work of
[45:34] grace sanctification he didn't do away
[45:36] with what Luther preached he preached
[45:38] justification and sanctification right
[45:41] then when the Pentecostals came they
[45:43] didn't do away with justification
[45:44] sanctification they believed in those
[45:46] things as well but then they also
[45:47] believed in the restoration of the gifts
[45:49] God was adding
[45:51] but then so so they believed in the
[45:53] baptism of the holy ghost and brother
[45:54] Branham says that they received the
[45:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost to make way
[45:58] for the person of Jesus Christ being
[46:00] counted in this church once again in his
[46:01] false right so it's not doing away just
[46:04] like when people you know many people
[46:06] they do not understand when brother
[46:08] Brown says well we're not living in a
[46:10] Pentecostal age then they begin to think
[46:12] well that you're saying that and you're
[46:14] doing away with everything in Pentecost
[46:15] no we're not doing away with what some
[46:17] Pentecost we still have it right we
[46:19] still have everything everything they
[46:21] had we have right everything lose the
[46:24] head was justification we have it but in
[46:26] a greater measure right sanctification
[46:28] as well because sanctification under
[46:30] Wesley was works that's why they called
[46:32] the Methodists they had a method of
[46:34] living a holy life but we don't have a
[46:36] method we have him in us makes us holy
[46:39] right his spirit and you sanctifies you
[46:42] cleanses you changes your affections
[46:45] what you love and not love whatever he
[46:47] changes you so you become holy right
[46:49] holiness is of the Lord hallelujah so
[46:52] it's his doing I mean so now so now we
[46:56] have those things we have the gifts
[46:58] right we have the supernatural power of
[47:01] God I mean we have all those things and
[47:03] we also know if you read through church
[47:06] history that the baptism of the Holy
[47:08] Ghost was for the believer down through
[47:10] the age but it was manifested in
[47:12] different ways but they received the
[47:14] Holy Ghost like we receive it right but
[47:17] the Methodists could only manifest that
[47:20] part of the plant right it wasn't the
[47:23] grain again it was the tassel right the
[47:25] grain had to come later on but they were
[47:27] manifesting what they called the
[47:29] manifest like the Lutheran's like the
[47:30] Pentecostals but now the grain is back
[47:32] again right we're not we're not part of
[47:35] the plant looking closer to the grain
[47:37] the green is here holiness to the life
[47:40] you see in the son of man as you see in
[47:41] Jesus Christ as now in the bride form
[47:44] hallelujah
[47:45] so now we have everything and also I
[47:48] want to say these things because if we
[47:50] deny what God has done in the past some
[47:53] people say well we're the original
[47:54] Pentecost no we've gone past Pentecost
[47:57] right but we don't do away with what
[47:59] Pentecost was because what people do is
[48:02] they say well we're the original
[48:03] Pentecost they had nothing
[48:05] and they actually get rid of the very
[48:07] ones that pave the way for the bride to
[48:09] be here because they do not know who
[48:11] they are in the scripture right so
[48:13] everything Pentecost was we have amen
[48:16] but the difference is we have the word
[48:19] the son of man has been revealed right
[48:22] so we don't have Christ and measure but
[48:24] in fullness not not just a part of him
[48:27] but all of him right the Lutheran's
[48:29] could only live a slice and just shall
[48:31] live by faith it's as high as they could
[48:33] live that was Christ working in them
[48:35] then the Methodists come with
[48:36] sanctification a little closer right to
[48:39] the book of Acts but that's as far as
[48:42] they could live and then the restoration
[48:44] of the gifts again closer to the book of
[48:46] Acts and many thought that was the full
[48:48] restoration but it was still not quite
[48:50] there but in the green came right how
[48:53] lujah so so if we are the grain if the
[48:57] grain is here then there's no plateau
[49:00] right there's no leveling off there's no
[49:02] just sitting back in learning a few more
[49:04] things now at the life of grows and
[49:06] expands we're call to grow into the very
[49:09] fullness of Jesus Christ I mean let's
[49:12] just let's just read that shall we in in
[49:14] I'm an ex ex ex chapter 4 so if I don't
[49:19] get through tonight well we're just pick
[49:20] it up Sunday because these things are
[49:22] very important we need to know we need
[49:25] to know we're living in a different age
[49:26] and that age has has blessings
[49:29] everything we need is in the son of man
[49:31] Jesus Christ right we are we're not
[49:34] living the world is in ladies here but
[49:36] we are not in lady osya and this has to
[49:39] be a personal revelation to you when you
[49:42] become one with Jesus Christ in the
[49:44] state Amen that's when you are called
[49:47] out that's why it's not a group we are
[49:49] not going in a rapture because we come
[49:51] to this place right Amen sure a church
[49:55] body works together God manifests
[49:56] himself through the body but you do not
[49:58] go in a rapture through association
[50:00] right you know you do not go and the rap
[50:03] is just because mommy and daddy know God
[50:05] or brother or sister you have to norm
[50:07] yourself that's the only way that you're
[50:09] gone to rapture is that you know Jesus
[50:11] Christ personally for yourself
[50:13] hallelujah I'm glad he's here to meet
[50:15] Lori now Acts chapter 4
[50:19] oh sorry Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4 and
[50:29] let's start from verse 12 I know I'm
[50:31] just I've you know we've covered some of
[50:33] this before but I just want to lay a bit
[50:35] of a foundation here so it's it's for
[50:38] that because we're going to see where
[50:39] we're going and what we're becoming
[50:40] right because if we think we're some
[50:42] former age what we're going to go back
[50:44] but we're going forward we're going to
[50:46] know who where we are I mean for the
[50:49] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[50:51] the ministry for the edifying of the
[50:53] body of Christ so this is a speak about
[50:55] the fivefold ministry
[50:58] Allu you write till we all come in the
[51:03] unity of the faith and to the knowledge
[51:05] of the Son of God unto a perfect man and
[51:08] to the measure of the stature of the
[51:10] fullness of Christ till we all come to
[51:13] this image right till we grow into this
[51:16] right that we henceforth be no more
[51:19] children tossed to and fro and carried
[51:20] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[51:22] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[51:24] whereby they lie in wait to deceive but
[51:27] speaking the truth and love may grow up
[51:29] into him in all things which is which is
[51:32] the head even Christ from whom owed me
[51:36] the whole body fitly joined together and
[51:38] compacted by that which every joint
[51:40] supplieth according to the effectual
[51:42] working in the measure of every part
[51:44] maketh increase of the body unto the
[51:46] edifying of itself and love that's why
[51:51] it's very saying we're growing into the
[51:54] fullness of Christ we have to until we
[51:56] all come to this and this is to the
[51:58] perfect man that you're the you know
[52:00] many times in the scripture the word
[52:02] perfect means complete entire the full
[52:05] image right so we're growing into this
[52:09] amen and this is the age where it
[52:11] happens where we grow into the statue of
[52:14] the fullness of Christ individually
[52:17] right so this is the so in the Bride age
[52:20] this is where this takes place now we're
[52:25] just going to go through a quick I want
[52:29] to show you very quickly that there's
[52:31] been a is a change in dispensation
[52:33] where there's a reason Jesus is kicked
[52:36] out of the church age unless in church
[52:39] age now if we go to Matthew 21 we're
[52:43] just going to read it a bit of Scripture
[52:45] here Matthew 21 and this is the parable
[52:48] of the of the vineyard
[53:03] so Matthew 21 in verse 33 now it's very
[53:08] evident I know we could say when Jesus
[53:11] was here and he was hanging on Calvary
[53:14] the Lambs they offered at the temple did
[53:17] no good because they'd been a change
[53:20] right and so Matthew 21 and verse 33
[53:25] hear another parable there's a certain
[53:27] householder which planted a vineyard and
[53:29] hedged it round about and digged a
[53:31] winepress in it and built a tower and
[53:33] let it out the husbandmen and went into
[53:35] a far country and when the time of the
[53:37] fruit drew near he sent his servants to
[53:39] be husbandmen that they might receive
[53:41] the fruits of it and the husbandmen took
[53:43] his servants and beat one and killed
[53:44] another and stoned another again he sent
[53:46] other servants more than the first and
[53:48] they did unto them likewise but last of
[53:51] all he sent unto them his son saying
[53:53] they will reverence my son but when the
[53:56] husbandmen saw the son they said among
[53:57] themselves this is the year
[53:59] come let us kill him and let us seize on
[54:02] his inheritance and they caught him and
[54:04] cast him out of the vineyard and slew
[54:05] him when the Lord therefore the vineyard
[54:07] cometh what will he do unto the
[54:09] husbandmen they say unto him he will
[54:12] miserably destroy those wicked men and
[54:14] will let out his vineyard unto other
[54:17] husbandmen which shall render him the
[54:19] fruits in their seasons jesus said unto
[54:23] them have you never read in the
[54:25] scriptures the stone which the builders
[54:26] rejected the same has become the head of
[54:28] the corner this is the Lord's doing it
[54:30] is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I
[54:33] unto you the kingdom of God shall be
[54:34] taken from you and given to a nation
[54:36] bringing forth the fruits thereof and
[54:38] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[54:41] be broken but on whomsoever it shall
[54:43] fall it will grind him to powder so
[54:47] Jesus actually saying to the scribes and
[54:49] Pharisees the kingdom is going to be
[54:51] taken from you and given to another
[54:53] because you're going to kill the son
[54:55] right and so now there is a change in
[54:58] dispensation from law to grace from law
[55:02] to grace as I said as soon as Jesus was
[55:05] hanging on Calvary the blood of bulls
[55:07] and goats didn't work anymore because as
[55:09] the Apostle Paul says the book of
[55:11] Hebrews there's now a new and living way
[55:14] hallelujah so
[55:15] there was a change going on and it's the
[55:18] same thing today where there's a change
[55:20] from grace to judgment but in the
[55:24] between time a bride is called out
[55:27] hallelujah now brother Bram sees this
[55:31] and in the indictment so you see in the
[55:34] scripture we've got a Jerusalem the
[55:36] church has it's in heaven heavenly
[55:38] Jerusalem we God as we God as God and
[55:41] today it's not under some creed or
[55:43] something that we try to make it a
[55:44] Jerusalem we'd like the Methodists would
[55:47] like to say to make the Methodists
[55:48] headquarters a Jerusalem the Catholic
[55:50] would like to make Rome in different
[55:51] places where we've had our headquarters
[55:54] they'd like to make it a Jerusalem but
[55:56] the Bible says our Jerusalem is from
[55:58] above which is the mother of all the
[55:59] believers now in Christ as God's
[56:02] provided lamb notice how appropriate it
[56:05] it was now staying that that Jerusalem
[56:09] was ceasing so the natural Jerusalem on
[56:11] the earth was ceasing when it was an
[56:14] effect until that hour so it worked
[56:16] until that hour that Jesus was there the
[56:18] blood of the Lamb was all right until
[56:20] that day but now at the crucifixion it
[56:23] changes the old system is done there was
[56:25] a new one the lamb was at the sacrifice
[56:28] the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the
[56:31] grounds they were condemning and doing
[56:33] the very thing that they had to do
[56:34] that's right so they had to crucify him
[56:38] they had to reject them and crucify him
[56:41] and the kingdom was taken from them and
[56:43] given to us
[56:44] I mean God will call the people who are
[56:47] not my people who weren't his people
[56:49] will now become the people of God where
[56:50] the kingdom was taking on the Jews now
[56:52] given to the Gentiles and that was when
[56:55] the Son of Man was manifested right
[56:57] Jesus referred to himself as the Son of
[57:00] Man prophet so when he was there there
[57:03] was a change and it's the same thing now
[57:05] in this day where went from seven church
[57:08] ages of God allowing you know you know
[57:11] allowing denomination to work but then
[57:13] when the son of man was revealed Jesus
[57:15] Christ the word and they rejected him
[57:17] and crucified him then he then he left
[57:19] the systems and began working with his
[57:21] bride only amen now
[57:27] brother uh so jesus said now so the
[57:31] kingdom of God you say well the kingdom
[57:35] of God is not with observation or
[57:37] geographical location that's why you
[57:42] know when when when Jesus said if they
[57:44] say he's in the desert of a secret place
[57:46] he's not in a location but he is in the
[57:48] manifestation of his word right he's not
[57:50] in a geographical place he's in the
[57:52] manifestation of his word the kingdom of
[57:55] God does not come with observation as
[57:57] Jesus's and Luke 17 but the kingdom of
[58:00] God is within you the Holy Ghost amen
[58:02] and so now and then he says about as as
[58:06] the Lightning shine is from one part of
[58:08] part under heaven and shown it to the
[58:10] other part of heaven so shall it be also
[58:13] the son of man in his day so what you
[58:15] see with lightning you know whose watch
[58:18] for lightning go across the sky
[58:19] it doesn't start lightening and end up a
[58:22] goose I'm saying something ridiculous it
[58:25] starts lighting ends up lightening the
[58:27] same manifestation you see there is
[58:29] there right so the same interface nation
[58:32] of Jesus Christ and his first coming we
[58:34] saw in a second coming the same life
[58:36] that was on display there we saw here
[58:39] right that's the son of man in his day
[58:41] now gee if we went to the you know if we
[58:47] win and spoke to the scribes and
[58:49] Pharisees you know they would say they
[58:54] would they would of course speak against
[58:56] what God did in their day Paul said to
[58:59] King Agrippa that these things were not
[59:01] done in a corner
[59:02] they weren't hidden from him this is
[59:04] many years after Jesus had come in and
[59:07] died and resurrected he said I'm
[59:09] persuaded that none of these things are
[59:10] hidden from him speaking of King Agrippa
[59:12] for this was not done in a corner so he
[59:15] was speaking of the Ministry of Jesus
[59:16] Christ it wasn't done in a corner wasn't
[59:18] done in a hidden place or a secret place
[59:20] or a desert place it was done out and
[59:22] open right but the scribes and Pharisees
[59:24] however wanted it to be done in a corner
[59:26] they would have been happy it was done
[59:28] in a secret place but God doesn't do
[59:30] things like that he does it fall in
[59:32] front of everyone but the elect catch
[59:33] really what's going on right today and
[59:36] they warn their people not to go to the
[59:38] meetings we
[59:39] Jesus was because if they did if they
[59:41] went to his meetings they they would be
[59:43] kicked out of the synagogue they were
[59:45] told not to pay attention money was
[59:47] given to the soldiers that guarded the
[59:48] tomb in order that their testimony could
[59:50] could explain it away why it was trying
[59:54] to make the people forget right try to
[59:57] sweep the whole thing under the rug in
[59:58] order to use the argument no one knows
[1:00:01] about this this is a parallel they want
[1:00:04] to sweep the Ministry of brother branham
[1:00:06] the Son of Man Jesus Christ under the
[1:00:08] rug no one's heard of this this didn't
[1:00:11] really happen they explain it they try
[1:00:13] and explain it away right it didn't
[1:00:16] really happen as the disciples say go
[1:00:18] ask the soldiers that were at the tomb
[1:00:20] what would their testimony be his body
[1:00:22] was stolen the supernatural they claim
[1:00:25] was all fabricated made up these
[1:00:27] so-called followers they are just
[1:00:30] kingdom building trying to get you to
[1:00:31] follow some dead man how can you have
[1:00:34] confidence in what he said when one of
[1:00:37] his so-called disciples went against
[1:00:38] them and actually helped us arrest them
[1:00:41] this would be if we're asking Caiaphas
[1:00:43] about this whole Jesus thing right what
[1:00:47] does that tell you the character the
[1:00:50] moral integrity of these so-called
[1:00:51] apostles
[1:00:52] if one of them actually betrayed their
[1:00:54] very God they claim to be serving right
[1:00:57] and look at them ignorant and unlearned
[1:00:59] as they say they are prostitute
[1:01:01] Samaritans publicans and sinners don't
[1:01:04] you know that cults always target those
[1:01:06] who are the vulnerable of society amen
[1:01:11] don't that's what people say cults
[1:01:13] target vulnerable people who did Jesus
[1:01:15] go see the woman at the well vulnerable
[1:01:17] person Society Legion right ignorant
[1:01:20] fisherman that didn't know the scripture
[1:01:22] so cool what one of the church people
[1:01:25] went and joined his group not not many
[1:01:27] and look at the methods of look at the
[1:01:31] methods of Paul the Apostle Paul he went
[1:01:34] to the church he or he went to the
[1:01:35] synagogue see he debated with him he
[1:01:38] said I'm sick of us and he goes to the
[1:01:40] ones who don't really know he went he
[1:01:43] targeted the vulnerable of society that
[1:01:47] was the elect Amen cult sois don't
[1:01:53] you know coke cult toys target those who
[1:01:55] are vulnerable society 1st Corinthians 1
[1:01:57] and 26 he says how that not many wise
[1:02:00] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[1:02:03] many noble are called so as the out
[1:02:05] cursor
[1:02:06] not many learned of great people are as
[1:02:07] followers where are those among us or as
[1:02:10] followers if he was really the Messiah
[1:02:12] wouldn't it have been us that he that
[1:02:15] would have recognized them look at Moses
[1:02:17] Moses went to the elders of Israel and
[1:02:20] told them who he was and what his
[1:02:22] commission was and they received him
[1:02:24] who's read that in the scripture and
[1:02:26] this and Moses said I mean this Jesus
[1:02:31] claimed that he was really the Prophet
[1:02:34] that Moses said would come like a nun to
[1:02:36] him so he would have done the same thing
[1:02:39] wouldn't he
[1:02:41] no he didn't do that did he
[1:02:44] yet not one of our great leaders such as
[1:02:47] the great holy noble High Priest
[1:02:48] received them but he was who he said he
[1:02:51] was I want you to think about these
[1:02:54] things because what happened in the
[1:02:55] first coming has happened again that's
[1:02:59] why I'm bringing these things in but
[1:03:01] really when you see these things happen
[1:03:02] it's cause is a dispensational change
[1:03:07] the reason they hated him was because he
[1:03:11] is bringing in a new age he was actually
[1:03:13] getting rid of and exposing their
[1:03:16] religious hypocrisy you go read Matthew
[1:03:19] 23 he pronounces seven woes on all of
[1:03:21] them where is the man from the Sermon on
[1:03:24] the Mount he was the still the same man
[1:03:26] who preached the Sermon on the Mount but
[1:03:28] now judgment was coming Allu yeah the
[1:03:32] reason I hated him was because of the
[1:03:34] new age was coming in and they had to be
[1:03:36] blinded in order for this to happen now
[1:03:39] let's go to you know it says in the book
[1:03:42] of Peter it's speaking about whom to
[1:03:46] whom coming as a living stone well let's
[1:03:49] let's go to I believe its first Peter -
[1:03:55] I don't have the
[1:04:03] yes first Peter - to whom coming first
[1:04:10] Peter - and for this had to happen to
[1:04:15] whom coming is unto a Livingstone
[1:04:18] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:04:19] God and precious ye also as lively
[1:04:22] stones are built up a spiritual house a
[1:04:24] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:04:26] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:04:28] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[1:04:31] the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[1:04:34] chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[1:04:36] that believeth on him shall not be
[1:04:38] confounded and to you therefore which
[1:04:40] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:04:42] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:04:44] builders disallowed the same has made
[1:04:46] the head of the corner and a stone of
[1:04:49] stumbling and a rock of offence even to
[1:04:51] them with which stumble at the word
[1:04:53] being disobedient where unto also they
[1:04:58] were appointed they stumbled when the
[1:05:00] stone came the first time because he
[1:05:02] didn't come their way
[1:05:04] he didn't come according to what they
[1:05:07] expected it was the it they stumbled at
[1:05:11] his appearance and how he presented
[1:05:12] himself that's how he stumbled they
[1:05:15] called him in Matthew 11 a wine-bibber
[1:05:18] and a gluttonous man and the book of
[1:05:20] proverbs said be not among wine but a
[1:05:23] wine boobers among riotous eaters of the
[1:05:26] flesh so they attach this thing to him
[1:05:28] and they could have said look at season
[1:05:30] proverbs have nothing to do with this
[1:05:32] kind of fellow amen there was the there
[1:05:37] was the man who was that the was was at
[1:05:41] the Pool of Bethesda he was there for a
[1:05:43] very long time if one knows the story it
[1:05:46] was the Sabbath day Jesus came along
[1:05:48] healed him and told him to take up his
[1:05:51] bed and carry it away on the Sabbath day
[1:05:53] they told don't do any work on the
[1:05:54] Sabbath day de stumbled them and the
[1:05:58] Lord did these things because he was
[1:06:00] really proving what's in them would they
[1:06:02] really humble themselves to this man of
[1:06:05] Galilee which was their Messiah or would
[1:06:07] they rise up and say let's do away with
[1:06:09] this fellow and you know what happened
[1:06:12] he did away
[1:06:13] I mean they did it away with him it said
[1:06:17] now and they also used his words against
[1:06:20] them this is again happening in this day
[1:06:23] Matthew are so mark 14 and 58 every
[1:06:28] account of the of the trial of Jesus
[1:06:31] Christ they used the scripture Jesus
[1:06:34] said destroy this temple and in three
[1:06:36] days I'll raise it up again and they use
[1:06:39] and they quote the very Messiah and they
[1:06:42] use it against them but they don't well
[1:06:44] let's just read one mark 14 and 58 we
[1:06:47] heard him say I will destroy this temple
[1:06:50] which is made with hands and within
[1:06:52] three days I build another temple made
[1:06:54] without hands see they heard what he
[1:06:58] said
[1:06:58] but didn't catch what he meant and they
[1:07:01] stumbled at it because they're looking
[1:07:03] through a natural mind looking through a
[1:07:05] carnal mind yeah this temples been here
[1:07:07] for a long time he said he's going to
[1:07:09] destroy it and then make one without
[1:07:11] hands in three days they didn't
[1:07:12] understand what he meant the thing is he
[1:07:15] didn't say no hold on can I have the
[1:07:18] Talking Stick can I be in the box
[1:07:20] witness box this is what I mean he
[1:07:22] didn't actually explain himself funny
[1:07:24] isn't it he could have proved them all
[1:07:26] wrong he could have explained it's
[1:07:28] hidden actually this is what I meant but
[1:07:31] he allowed the accusations to actually
[1:07:33] you know be heard he didn't even defend
[1:07:37] himself interesting isn't it when he
[1:07:40] could have but he just let them rail on
[1:07:42] him amen
[1:07:45] maybe we should think about that well I
[1:07:48] don't know why I didn't defend himself
[1:07:49] but he knew it had to happen
[1:07:53] now so there was a change there was a
[1:07:57] change in dispensation I'm sure we can
[1:07:59] all agree it went from a natural lamb to
[1:08:01] the lamb right so wheat from the natural
[1:08:04] blood of bulls and goats to us to to
[1:08:08] Jesus Christ the word being crucified
[1:08:10] and then now the old Jerusalem was done
[1:08:13] away with there was a change now we've
[1:08:17] come down to this time where where the
[1:08:23] same has happened again the
[1:08:25] denominational ages are done
[1:08:27] God is on the outside of his church and
[1:08:30] he's calling people to come unto Him now
[1:08:34] we're it there the cornerstone is a
[1:08:38] stumbling stone Jesus Christ is a
[1:08:40] stumbling stone and he still stumbles
[1:08:42] people his word stumbles people now
[1:08:45] brother Branham he he comes through his
[1:08:49] ministry and he begins to speak about
[1:08:52] the third pole about the three poles of
[1:08:55] his ministry quite early on it's in the
[1:08:59] mid mid mid 50s when he begins to speak
[1:09:02] about the third pole and I know time is
[1:09:06] running away but we'll try and run with
[1:09:08] it now and then he comes down he and he
[1:09:11] preaches a service called services this
[1:09:13] is time at the end oh is this the time
[1:09:15] of the insert so what's happened is just
[1:09:17] like Jesus ministry healing happened
[1:09:20] discernment happened but that wasn't the
[1:09:23] reason the reason was he was going to
[1:09:25] reveal who he was the word was going to
[1:09:27] open to the people that was the that was
[1:09:30] the purpose of the healing and the
[1:09:31] discernment is that now the word would
[1:09:33] come open just like Moses the signs and
[1:09:35] wonders were to gather the people that
[1:09:37] the word would come on Mount Sinai that
[1:09:39] was the purpose of his ministry and said
[1:09:41] our brother Branham God sends a spirit
[1:09:43] of Elijah upon the earth and the
[1:09:45] supernatural is done to get the
[1:09:47] attention of the people because God is
[1:09:49] going to open his word the mystery of
[1:09:51] God should be finished in this day and
[1:09:52] God has to put a profit upon the earth
[1:09:55] that his voice can speak and the mystery
[1:09:57] of God that Paul started will be
[1:09:59] completed in this thing hallelujah so
[1:10:02] now so this way the miracles took place
[1:10:06] post-world War two healing revival
[1:10:07] happened and historians attribute
[1:10:09] brother Browns ministry is spearheading
[1:10:11] it history history shows it was his
[1:10:14] ministry that did it change the face of
[1:10:16] America and then but the whole reason
[1:10:19] wasn't the healing it was now that the
[1:10:22] son of man Jesus Christ was going to be
[1:10:24] revealed that a people can have a true
[1:10:26] union with them with Jesus Christ the
[1:10:28] word not with a church so then he comes
[1:10:32] so so he comes down to so in 1962 we
[1:10:37] know in 63 the seals come open write the
[1:10:41] word
[1:10:41] comes open and then now and then he is
[1:10:44] he has a vision of angels and things
[1:10:48] coming and then he's there and he's
[1:10:51] wondering what it means because a
[1:10:53] prophet doesn't hasn't shown everything
[1:10:54] and he says after the spirit left me for
[1:10:58] about half an hour I guess I said Lord
[1:11:00] if it is then and I'm going to be killed
[1:11:03] and you're finished with me on earth I'm
[1:11:05] going to be taken home now if it is that
[1:11:08] that's fine that's alright so I said if
[1:11:10] it has let me know send your power back
[1:11:13] on me again then I'll know not to tell
[1:11:16] my people anyone about it because you're
[1:11:18] fixing to catch me away and nothing
[1:11:21] happened I waited a while then I said
[1:11:23] Lord Jesus if it does not mean that and
[1:11:26] it means that you've got something for
[1:11:27] me to do and it'll be revealed to me
[1:11:30] later then send your power he says and
[1:11:32] it almost took me from the room I found
[1:11:34] myself somewhere over in the corner I
[1:11:36] heard my wife somewhere trying to shake
[1:11:38] a door the door to the bedroom was
[1:11:41] locked and I had a Bible open and I was
[1:11:44] reading I don't know but it wasn't I
[1:11:45] believe Romans the ninth chapter the
[1:11:47] last verse behold I lay in Zion a
[1:11:50] cornerstone a stumbling stone a precious
[1:11:52] cornerstone and whosoever believeth on
[1:11:55] him shall not be ashamed and I thought
[1:11:57] it strange I'd be reading that spirit
[1:11:59] still packing me in the room I closed up
[1:12:02] the Bible and stood there there when
[1:12:04] he's speaking about the cornerstone
[1:12:06] that's the capstone so the so the church
[1:12:09] that was built the Apostles built the
[1:12:12] foundation there the beginning stones of
[1:12:15] the building of Jesus Christ was laid
[1:12:17] there in the Ephesian age they had that
[1:12:19] there come a time when the capstone is
[1:12:21] put on the building where all of because
[1:12:23] we're all living stones we read write
[1:12:25] every believer through the ages are
[1:12:27] living stones and then we put in the
[1:12:29] building right but there comes a time
[1:12:31] when the capstone comes and the whole
[1:12:34] body of Christ has been completed so now
[1:12:36] what's happening is this command
[1:12:38] Junction and time where now the capstone
[1:12:40] is going to come to the body the head
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ is going to unite himself
[1:12:44] with his body upon the earth this is
[1:12:46] what he's talking about this monumental
[1:12:48] this incredible event that's going to
[1:12:51] take place where Christ His Word has
[1:12:53] been going to come fully in flow
[1:12:55] once again in people not just in one
[1:12:58] right not just in one there in the
[1:13:01] Gospels yo but now in his bride the word
[1:13:04] is going to put on flesh again
[1:13:06] hallelujah so now he's saying now this
[1:13:09] he's saying what does this all mean and
[1:13:11] God sends his power and if you go read
[1:13:14] Romans 9 well I don't know what kind of
[1:13:17] Bible he had a Scofield Bible but I'm
[1:13:21] sure any Bible if you go to Romans
[1:13:24] chapter 9 it doesn't look it doesn't
[1:13:32] look very nothing really jumps out at
[1:13:34] you does that I just want you to think
[1:13:36] about this but when he had it but his
[1:13:38] Bible was open and his eyes were
[1:13:40] directed to the end of the chapter God's
[1:13:43] telling him in the scripture this is
[1:13:44] what's happening there's a change
[1:13:47] happening where now I'm gonna come I'm
[1:13:50] going to come I'll be a stumbling stone
[1:13:52] but to the precious to the elect I'm
[1:13:55] going to be a precious stone because I'm
[1:13:57] the lord I'm their husband I'm coming to
[1:13:59] the wife I'm coming to find my bride
[1:14:02] hallelujah
[1:14:03] and so now here he is you know brother
[1:14:08] branham's in in in in Arizona and a
[1:14:11] sword comes into his hand he's in Sabino
[1:14:12] Canyon and a sword appears in his hand
[1:14:16] Amy and he says it fits his hand just
[1:14:18] right hallelujah it's just like Elijah's
[1:14:23] mental Elijah had to be changed to fit
[1:14:26] the mantle then I think when he put it
[1:14:29] on he would have felt that fits me just
[1:14:30] write that that sword represented the
[1:14:32] Word of God because he said 8yo because
[1:14:36] the sword was there he said he's always
[1:14:38] been afraid of a knife they said oh and
[1:14:41] then he heard a voice a king he thought
[1:14:44] it said a king's sword he said well do I
[1:14:45] go Knight people or you know give them
[1:14:47] ministries know the voice you know the
[1:14:49] Kings sword they said the only thing
[1:14:51] King there is is God and the sword is
[1:14:53] the word so now the word fit the prophet
[1:14:56] just right he had been molded for many
[1:14:58] years that now God could use a vessel to
[1:15:01] open up the word use a vessel to reveal
[1:15:04] himself in the scripture like never
[1:15:06] before John was gonna write the seven
[1:15:08] thunders
[1:15:09] he told write them not until the days of
[1:15:11] the voice of the seventh angel then
[1:15:13] they'll be known hallelujah
[1:15:15] so things that John saw but then right
[1:15:17] now we hear and we know what it is it's
[1:15:20] always been in there but now it's been
[1:15:21] revealed and when God releases his word
[1:15:24] he releases a power in that word
[1:15:26] hallelujah that's why we're not ordained
[1:15:28] to fall like the first thief this bride
[1:15:31] brother Graham says as the first Steve
[1:15:33] was actually ordained to fall the second
[1:15:35] Eva's ordained not to fall hallelujah
[1:15:38] that we are going to live a life to show
[1:15:39] we're not like the first Eve I mean we
[1:15:42] are built we are predestinated that we
[1:15:44] will not fall like she did but we will
[1:15:46] overcome
[1:15:47] Allu yeah they mention now so he
[1:15:52] received the sword of the king now in in
[1:15:57] the seventh seal brother Burnham relates
[1:16:00] this and before this I said I think I
[1:16:04] think it's a 1956 he speaks about the
[1:16:06] three pools of his ministry the first
[1:16:09] pull is the taking the people by the
[1:16:11] hand and seeing the disease the sick and
[1:16:13] Paul was the discernment and the third
[1:16:15] Paul was the opening of the word and
[1:16:17] he's looking to see when is this third
[1:16:19] Paul going to manifest and in the vision
[1:16:22] when he sees well well I'll just read
[1:16:24] this he says and then a voice shook down
[1:16:27] through there that rock the rock said
[1:16:29] it's the sword of the king and then I
[1:16:31] came out of it the sword of the king now
[1:16:33] if it said the sort of a king but it
[1:16:35] said the sword of the king and there's
[1:16:37] only one the king that's God and he has
[1:16:39] he has one sword that's his word what
[1:16:42] I've lived by that so help me God
[1:16:44] standing over his holy disc here with
[1:16:46] this holy word laying open it's the word
[1:16:48] Amen oh what a day we're living in what
[1:16:50] a great thing see the mystery in secret
[1:16:53] the third standing there when this left
[1:16:55] me something just came to me and said
[1:16:56] don't fear now I didn't hear no voice
[1:16:59] like I've inside me spoke I just tell
[1:17:02] you the truth just exactly what happened
[1:17:04] something had said don't fear this is
[1:17:05] the third Paul 3rd Paul you remember it
[1:17:08] he said you've had so many
[1:17:11] impersonations on this which is the gift
[1:17:13] in the hand and the discernment you know
[1:17:15] here there's a lot of impersonations on
[1:17:17] that he said you bet so many
[1:17:20] impersonations on the honest what
[1:17:22] have tried to explain he said don't even
[1:17:24] try this you remember how many remembers
[1:17:27] the vision well it's it's all over it's
[1:17:29] taped in everywhere it's been about six
[1:17:31] years seven years ago I've been seven
[1:17:32] years ago said don't try to explain it
[1:17:34] said this is the third pole but I'll
[1:17:37] meet you in there that's right amen he
[1:17:39] said he said I was standing with a
[1:17:41] little baby shoe and when he told me now
[1:17:44] make your first pull and when you do
[1:17:46] this the fish will run after the lower I
[1:17:48] said then what you're sick and pull
[1:17:50] because because it'll it'll be only be
[1:17:53] small fish he said the third pull will
[1:17:55] get it's big of the prize the bright is
[1:17:57] the prize hallelujah then the third pull
[1:18:01] will get it and all of their ministers
[1:18:03] got around me said brother Brennan we
[1:18:04] know you can do it hallelujah brother
[1:18:06] Brennan that's where I always get tied
[1:18:08] up with a bunch of preachers see I love
[1:18:10] people they want you to explain
[1:18:12] everything I see well I don't know I
[1:18:15] said I have understanding fishing now I
[1:18:20] said now the first thing you do here is
[1:18:22] is the way it's done you just see all
[1:18:24] all the fish around you got to jerk the
[1:18:27] loop jerk the lure that's exactly the
[1:18:29] tactics of fishing so I said jerk the
[1:18:31] lure now you see when I jerked the lure
[1:18:33] the first time now the fish takes out
[1:18:36] after it but there they were little ones
[1:18:37] and they were just and that's just like
[1:18:41] we were catching and then I said then
[1:18:43] you'll sit and I jerked it out on the
[1:18:45] bank and I had a fish but it looked like
[1:18:47] a skin over the lure it was he was so
[1:18:49] little and then I was standing there and
[1:18:51] something said I told you not to do that
[1:18:53] I started crying all the line was
[1:18:55] tangled around me like this and I was
[1:18:57] standing there crying with my head down
[1:18:59] I said oh God forgive me
[1:19:01] he said I'm a stupid person Lord forgive
[1:19:03] me and I had this line and that what I
[1:19:07] had in my hand was a little baby shoe
[1:19:09] about that long and I had the string and
[1:19:11] about a big around as my finger about
[1:19:14] half inch like an eyelid in the shoe and
[1:19:16] was just the size of 1/16 probably an
[1:19:19] inch in the island I was trying to lace
[1:19:21] this little shoe up with this great big
[1:19:22] inch cord and a voice it you can't teach
[1:19:25] Pentecostal baby supernatural things
[1:19:27] said now you let him alone and just then
[1:19:31] he picked me up and he took me up and
[1:19:33] set me up what set me way up high
[1:19:36] to a meeting was going on I looked and
[1:19:38] it looked like a tent or a cathedral or
[1:19:40] some sort and I looked and there was a
[1:19:42] little box little place over on the side
[1:19:45] I seen that light was talking to
[1:19:47] somebody above me that light that you
[1:19:49] see here in the picture world away from
[1:19:51] me like that and it went over that
[1:19:53] tendon said I'll meet you in there and
[1:19:55] said this will be the third pull and you
[1:19:58] won't tell it to nobody and in sabino
[1:20:01] canyon he said this is the third pull
[1:20:04] now brother Brown for the rest of his
[1:20:06] life after that vision was looking to
[1:20:08] buy a tent and have big tent meetings
[1:20:10] but just like the first two visions they
[1:20:12] weren't natural visions their
[1:20:14] supernatural visions but God was telling
[1:20:16] him this will not be a public show this
[1:20:20] third pull will not be a public thing it
[1:20:23] will be a private thing right and so
[1:20:26] what this is speaking of now this third
[1:20:28] pull is when God comes personally to you
[1:20:32] that secret meeting place amen he says
[1:20:35] I'll meet you in there he wasn't
[1:20:37] speaking just to the property is
[1:20:38] speaking to the bride I'll meet you in a
[1:20:40] secret meeting place hallelujah just
[1:20:43] like Sarah was in the tent and and God
[1:20:46] Elohim became flesh and and and revealed
[1:20:49] what you're singing her heart and then
[1:20:50] Isaac took Rebecca after they after they
[1:20:53] met and they went to that Tina became
[1:20:55] one who became a secret meeting place
[1:20:57] right where a husband and wife became
[1:21:00] one and it's the same thing in this day
[1:21:02] an hour where God has called a bride
[1:21:05] it's not a public show when God unites
[1:21:07] himself with us bride it's not out in
[1:21:10] public right but they become one you
[1:21:13] can't impersonate it you can't explain
[1:21:16] it when God reveals his word to you and
[1:21:19] you become a new creature in him you
[1:21:21] can't you can't put it in words how
[1:21:23] wonderful he becomes you how lives the
[1:21:25] word becomes to you I mean because it's
[1:21:27] not a it's not a public show the devil
[1:21:30] can impersonate any gift but he can't
[1:21:32] impersonate the word and he can
[1:21:34] impersonate the word becoming flesh
[1:21:36] hallelujah because it's a life that has
[1:21:38] now looked brother Brahim says and the
[1:21:40] rising of the Sun he says he was the one
[1:21:42] who opened those seals he is those seals
[1:21:44] for the whole Word of God as Christ and
[1:21:47] Christ as the seals that's been open
[1:21:49] does the opening of the seals in
[1:21:51] revealing Christ revealing Jesus Christ
[1:21:54] so many people see well I see a horse
[1:21:57] riders and I see a tribulation I see
[1:21:59] this and that but no you got to look
[1:22:01] again see it's Jesus Christ being made
[1:22:03] known I mean because that the sword that
[1:22:06] came into his hand he is then instructed
[1:22:07] go back to Jeffersonville and you'll be
[1:22:09] told what the seven seals are and you
[1:22:11] preach it to the people and it was
[1:22:12] revealing Christ so Christ now had
[1:22:15] become unveiled or unsealed enemy and
[1:22:18] there's now here in this age to become
[1:22:20] one with his bride hallelujah Amen so
[1:22:26] that's why he says I'll meet you in
[1:22:27] there I'll meet you in the secret place
[1:22:30] that's why when you read the Song of
[1:22:31] Solomon that secret place by the stairs
[1:22:34] hallelujah I'll meet you in that place
[1:22:37] amen so this is why this is why this
[1:22:40] bride age is so tremendous it's not
[1:22:42] another denominational age another just
[1:22:44] move of the Spirit this is the climax
[1:22:46] age this is the peak age where God
[1:22:49] Himself that's why that cloud is
[1:22:50] tremendous to me I mean that it looks
[1:22:52] like Hoffman's head of Christ the
[1:22:54] painting and now that's the head looking
[1:22:56] for the body he's looking down to the
[1:22:57] earth
[1:22:58] he's now hunting his body Here I am to
[1:23:00] find my body
[1:23:01] helliya he found me
[1:23:04] amen my lord found me hallelujah that's
[1:23:08] why it goes beyond doctrine right you
[1:23:11] know your your computer can quote you a
[1:23:14] lot better than you and in multiple
[1:23:17] languages the message in the Bible but
[1:23:19] it can produce the life right it's those
[1:23:22] that really become one with him they
[1:23:24] produced a life with a bridegroom I'm
[1:23:26] it's just like the Lambs wife has made
[1:23:28] herself ready in Revelations 19 I mean
[1:23:31] the wife is the only one that can
[1:23:32] legally produce the child right then
[1:23:35] look that is made in the image of the
[1:23:37] father the husband hallelujah this is
[1:23:41] part of where we are you go look into
[1:23:44] what brother Brown says about the bride
[1:23:45] age he he never speaks bad about the
[1:23:47] bride age right and you even go look at
[1:23:50] his ministry where he has a in the 50s
[1:23:55] he's praying and he sees a vision of a
[1:23:59] of of his Bible come open to Joshua
[1:24:02] chapter one
[1:24:03] and then he reads the first nine verses
[1:24:06] of Joshua one and he gets given a Joshua
[1:24:09] commissioned the church has come through
[1:24:12] the wilderness now it's got a cross
[1:24:14] Jordan it's got to come into its
[1:24:17] inheritance program when he speaks to
[1:24:18] the Pentecostal people he speaks about
[1:24:20] them in the wilderness he speaks about
[1:24:23] the church came out of Egypt but it's in
[1:24:25] the wilderness right but he says now
[1:24:27] here comes a time for for the church to
[1:24:30] cross Jordan and gone to its inheritance
[1:24:32] our inheritance is in Christ right you
[1:24:36] read Hebrews three and four Paul
[1:24:37] parallels the promised land with Christ
[1:24:39] the Son of man right so now it now we're
[1:24:43] living in an era where we don't live in
[1:24:45] the desert we don't live in the
[1:24:47] wilderness we don't live in Egypt I mean
[1:24:50] but there's a word that's come open that
[1:24:52] parts Jordan where you can cross over
[1:24:54] into every promise of God I mean where
[1:24:57] we are actually dwelling in our promised
[1:24:59] land which is the son of man which is
[1:25:01] this age and then we're not living in a
[1:25:03] Pentecostal age we've gone past a
[1:25:04] Pentecostal age hallelujah and you'll
[1:25:07] know you're in there I mean when he
[1:25:09] becomes a reality and in when his word
[1:25:11] this this goes beyond stories it becomes
[1:25:14] a living reality to you programs said
[1:25:17] the Bible became a new book when the
[1:25:19] seals open right because now he can see
[1:25:22] Jesus Christ in every scripture and the
[1:25:24] mystery of the brighter become
[1:25:26] manifested into people oh yeah that's
[1:25:31] why you say well this this is not a
[1:25:33] teaching there's got to be experienced
[1:25:36] right where it goes beyond a prophet
[1:25:39] that's problem people get caught up with
[1:25:40] the veil with the Prophet they they they
[1:25:43] never those who go beyond the sign and
[1:25:46] they go to the where the sign is
[1:25:48] pointing to and they become one with him
[1:25:50] they don't have a trouble with the
[1:25:52] Prophet anymore because they met the one
[1:25:54] you know they're met the one that the
[1:25:55] Prophet introduced hallelujah brother
[1:25:58] BAM said my ministry is to show that he
[1:26:00] is here right Jesus Christ is here
[1:26:03] hallelujah
[1:26:05] we're not waiting for him to come he's
[1:26:08] here right but the coming finishes with
[1:26:11] us meaning his body in the air right
[1:26:15] we're part with we're already in a
[1:26:16] rapturous
[1:26:17] Michael the master has come and he
[1:26:19] calleth for thee amen
[1:26:22] and I trust you've actually something
[1:26:24] then you moved and you've given your all
[1:26:25] your broken your alabaster box you've
[1:26:28] surrendered everything you got no will
[1:26:30] to turn back - doesn't matter what
[1:26:32] rejection you know we have to face
[1:26:33] rejection we have to face criticism and
[1:26:37] and whatever more you know if they call
[1:26:40] the master Beelzebub our Lord Jesus they
[1:26:44] call them Beelzebub how much will will
[1:26:46] they call the followers and there comes
[1:26:50] a time which there comes a time where
[1:26:55] Mercy's done and there's no more and
[1:27:00] it's just to the souls in prison that
[1:27:03] there's a preaching - I don't believe
[1:27:05] her in that day yet but they'll come a
[1:27:08] time so the doors open get in cross the
[1:27:14] Jordan well it's a muddy play it's a
[1:27:17] muddy river just jump in cross Jordan
[1:27:21] die to yourself cross the river
[1:27:23] it's glorious on the other side o lujah
[1:27:26] Oh pick it up more on Sunday but we're
[1:27:30] living in a different season
[1:27:32] I mean God bless you qui have some
[1:27:34] musicians please want you to go go look
[1:27:39] into what he sees he's a big change from
[1:27:42] 1962 to 1963 onward there's a change in
[1:27:46] his ministry there's a change in
[1:27:47] dispensation he says now he says now
[1:27:51] we're in a bride age he sees it at the
[1:27:53] end of 1965 and he wasn't he's not here
[1:27:57] amen
[1:27:59] anymore the reason is because he
[1:28:01] delivered the message like Moses go read
[1:28:03] the book of Joshua see how many times
[1:28:05] Joshua quotes Moses in God he says Moses
[1:28:09] quite a lot he didn't add to the message
[1:28:12] that Moses gave he took that same
[1:28:14] message and the people went into the
[1:28:16] land right so now we've received a
[1:28:18] message the same anointing that was on
[1:28:20] Moses win upon Joshua and they claim
[1:28:22] their land so now the same anointing
[1:28:24] that was on the Prophet is now upon a
[1:28:26] bride and we claim our land right
[1:28:28] everything we have need of us in Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ
[1:28:31] I mean our inheritance is in the Holy
[1:28:32] Ghost this is why it's so important I
[1:28:35] mean if the Amalekites have built up
[1:28:37] have you know have built a fortress on
[1:28:39] you enjoy tear down the fortress I mean
[1:28:41] if this you know you know if Jericho

[1:28:56] just don't just put back well I've got
[1:28:58] this part no take it all amen you

[1:29:04] property you wake up the next morning

[1:29:09] tent and they're there around the
[1:29:10] campfire are you gonna put up with it

[1:29:15] has to be now no yeah you call the
[1:29:17] police and you watch them be arrested
[1:29:21] and carted off your land right and if
[1:29:23] those people are armed in the police are
