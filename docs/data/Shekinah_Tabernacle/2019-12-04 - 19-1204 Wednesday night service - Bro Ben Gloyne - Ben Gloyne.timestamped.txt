[2:27] branches get sunshine and they get lots
[2:30] of water down into the roots the leaves
[2:32] just open up and they become nice and
[2:34] lush and what it does is provide shade
[2:37] to worship Him to fellowship and under
[2:40] the shady green pastures and I believe

[46:46] bless you so judges six and let's read
[46:49] from verse 11 familiar piece of
[46:51] scripture to us all I'm sure speaking of
[46:53] Gideon and it came an angel of the Lord
[46:56] which set under an oak which was an
[46:58] offer that pertain earth under joash the
[47:01] Ebro sight and his son gideon thresh
[47:04] sweet by the winepress to hide it from
[47:06] the Midianites and the angel of the Lord
[47:07] appeared unto him and said unto Him the
[47:10] Lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[47:11] Valor and Gideon said unto Him o my lord
[47:14] if the Lord be with us why then is all
[47:16] this befallen us and where be all his
[47:19] miracles which our fathers told us
[47:21] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[47:23] Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us
[47:26] and deliver us into the hand of the
[47:27] Midianites and the Lord looked upon him
[47:30] and said go in this thy might and thou
[47:33] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[47:35] middie i'ts Midianites have not i sent
[47:37] thee and he said unto Him o my lord
[47:40] where Worth shall I save Israel behold
[47:42] my family is poor and Manasseh and I am
[47:44] the least in my father's house and the
[47:47] Lord said unto him surely I'll be with
[47:49] thee and now shall smite the Midian
[47:51] it's as one man let's go to Matthew
[47:55] chapter 27 it's just a scripture I you
[47:58] know we've been reading it around the
[47:59] dinner table and I just can't seem to
[48:02] get it out of me
[48:02] let's go to Matthew 27 and we're gonna
[48:05] read verses 8 to 10 let's read rather
[48:14] from verse 3 of Matthew 27 then Judas
[48:18] which had betrayed him when he saw that
[48:21] he was condemned repented himself and
[48:23] brought again the thirty pieces of
[48:25] silver to the chief priests and elders
[48:27] saying I have sinned in that I have
[48:29] betrayed innocent blood and they said
[48:31] unto Him what is that to us see that to
[48:33] that and he cast down the piece of
[48:35] silver in the temple and departed and
[48:36] went and hanged himself and the chief
[48:39] priests took the silver pieces and said
[48:40] it is not lawful for to put them into
[48:43] the Treasury because it is the price of
[48:44] blood and they took counsel and they
[48:46] brought with them the potter's field to
[48:48] bury strangers and where for that field
[48:51] was called the field of blood unto this
[48:53] day
[48:53] then it was fulfilled that which was
[48:55] spoken by Jeremy the Prophet saying and
[48:58] they took the thirty pieces of silver
[48:59] the price of him that was valued whom
[49:02] they of the children of Israel did value
[49:07] amen let's bow heads in a word of Prayer

[49:12] the sweetest name Lord something about

[51:15] battles my god father for your glory in
[51:18] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless
[51:21] you friends you may have your seats so
[51:23] here we here we have Gideon and and get
[51:27] in here he's living in the promised land
[51:29] you know he's he's living in his
[51:31] inheritance but yet because how the
[51:33] enemy has coming he's hiding himself
[51:35] away trying to Thresh wheat in secret
[51:39] afraid of what the enemy will do while
[51:43] he is in his position it's amazing where
[51:46] you know how how you know Gideon was a
[51:50] scriptural man brother Branham says and
[51:52] when he and when he when when the angel
[51:54] Lord came to him he asked them a very
[51:56] good question if God is with us
[51:58] where are the miracles where is that God
[52:00] our fathers fathers told us about and we
[52:03] understand brother Brown would say and
[52:04] spoke the spoken word as the original
[52:07] seed he says he says and the
[52:09] Pentecostals will do the same thing talk
[52:11] about denominating they that original
[52:13] revival in the Holy Ghost fell and
[52:14] called out a people and God trying to
[52:16] get his word to it and they organ
[52:18] I said sit over here denominated and
[52:20] died right there you say but look at
[52:21] what they're doing we'll get to that
[52:23] later on today see we're coming right
[52:25] down I'm just putting seated now now I'm
[52:28] going to show you after all what
[52:29] happened that's why each revival he says
[52:33] each generation has its revival God
[52:36] raises him up a man sits him with us
[52:38] word and he starts out with a message
[52:40] for that age I mean to every generation
[52:43] and I just want to anchor this and every
[52:45] generation must have its own revival not
[52:47] just the parents or not just the
[52:49] children but every generation has a
[52:52] chance at the word every generation has
[52:55] must have its own revival where God
[52:57] lives in them I mean that's not just the
[52:59] tradition not just something that's done
[53:01] because well this is what my family does
[53:03] but God becomes a Living God I mean that
[53:06] he is the same yesterday today and
[53:07] forever so every generation must have
[53:10] its own revival there's more than one
[53:11] generation sitting here tonight I mean
[53:13] each generation sitting here tonight
[53:15] must have its own revival not that we
[53:17] just conform to what our parents tell us
[53:19] or maybe what the church tells us but
[53:21] God comes and loves God manifests
[53:23] himself God changes our nature that the
[53:25] things no one has to tell us what to do
[53:27] what not to do God's nature just governs
[53:29] our lives and what he doesn't want us to
[53:31] do there's something in us is I don't
[53:33] want it hallelujah
[53:35] see every generation must have its own
[53:38] revival Gideon needed a revival
[53:41] hallelujah they had mighty testimonies
[53:43] but God had to become real to Gideon now
[53:46] Gideon even though he was a circumcised
[53:49] Azra light he was living in his
[53:50] inheritance the problem with Gideon as
[53:52] he was he was he was living out the name
[53:55] of his tribe now Manasseh means causes
[53:57] causes to forget and I know I've covered
[54:01] this a while ago but here we are again
[54:02] you know he was living out his tribes
[54:05] name causing to forget so he was causing
[54:07] to forget who he was he thought well
[54:10] this is just a situation in life the
[54:12] enemies come and they're too much for us
[54:14] you know but I'm here I'm gonna get a
[54:16] bit a week and a try and survive in my
[54:17] own little way just try and you know
[54:20] just just survive the season but he
[54:22] actually forgot that the god that was
[54:24] with Moses the God that was with Joshua
[54:26] the God that was you know with all the
[54:28] believers were still the same God
[54:31] he had not changed you say why are you
[54:33] talking about these each generation must
[54:35] have its own revival where God comes and
[54:37] lives in your life more than just
[54:39] excitement more than just a bunch of
[54:40] noise but a living word putting on flesh
[54:43] in you I mean but Gideon's first name
[54:46] actually means a fella isn't as as in a
[54:50] warrior he wasn't a worry he was afraid
[54:52] but notice when the angel Lord came to
[54:55] he says Gideon thou art a mighty man of
[54:58] Valor and when any knew he was the one
[55:01] who was ordained of them in the book I
[55:02] mean he he realized he was a fulfillment
[55:05] of the prophecy given to Abraham
[55:08] hallelujah and you can take even even
[55:10] John the Baptist parents here and he was
[55:12] here with Zechariah and the temple being
[55:14] a priest then the angel Lord comes to
[55:16] know that Gabriel came to came to him
[55:19] said you're gonna have the son and he's
[55:21] gonna fall run the Christ hallelujah so
[55:24] then so the angel came to reveal who
[55:26] they were in the scripture he was more
[55:28] than just a priest
[55:29] how they're more than just part of a
[55:31] man's system of religion he is more than
[55:33] as part of the scripture I took the
[55:35] angel Lord to come to him to reveal him
[55:38] this is who you are in the word and once
[55:40] he knew who he was and he could operate
[55:42] he could live according to what the
[55:44] scripture said he was same thing with
[55:46] Gideon Gideon was never ordained to be
[55:48] hiding in a cave threshing wheat afraid
[55:51] of his enemy that was not as true
[55:53] identity has tried then he was here is
[55:55] your portion here is your inheritance
[55:57] dwelling your inheritance dwell in peace
[56:00] any enemy comes and you get rid of him
[56:02] you kick them out I mean this is your
[56:04] luck this is your portion of my word you
[56:06] come and live in it that was his
[56:09] identity but he forgot who he was he
[56:14] didn't realize who he was and that's the
[56:16] problem that's why people can't be stuck
[56:18] between two opinions too much the world
[56:21] tells them they're one thing and God
[56:23] says they're another thing and they
[56:25] don't know who they are
[56:27] hallelujah but when God comes and tells
[56:29] you who you are then you can sit back it
[56:32] doesn't matter there see what the enemy
[56:33] tries to do and timid ain't you whatever
[56:35] more you don't have to please no one but
[56:37] God who you
[56:41] amen so whenever the angel of Lord comes
[56:43] to a person he reveals to them who they
[56:46] are in the scripture hallelujah amen
[56:50] it's the same thing with you and I
[56:51] Francie we have that same angels come to
[56:54] us that mighty angel Christ himself has
[56:56] come with an open book in this hour and
[56:59] that's just not a theory that's a
[57:00] reality I mean when you heard this
[57:02] message and it quicken your soul God is
[57:04] showing you who you are in the word he's
[57:07] wanting you to know who you are
[57:10] hallelujah so it's not a tradition it's
[57:13] a reality but the thing is that's yeah
[57:18] and there's a reason I read that
[57:19] scripture and Matthew they value Jesus
[57:22] the price of a slave because that's what
[57:25] they were told that's just what they did
[57:28] but his true value was lost upon them
[57:31] and how you value him is how you treat
[57:34] him they value him as a beelzebub Iza
[57:37] renegade he's just here to tear up our
[57:39] churches you know bring trouble and all
[57:42] these things let's just get rid of him
[57:43] they didn't value who he was and this
[57:48] word this message is Jesus Christ what
[57:51] value do you put upon it what value do
[57:54] you put on this and your life will
[57:58] actually be the answer of that question
[58:00] not what you say with this it's your
[58:02] life that's loved that's that's that's
[58:05] the proof or the evidence of you know
[58:07] what what value you put upon it because
[58:11] if you put the right value on it then
[58:13] you'll get the what it's intended for
[58:15] many people came to Jesus to get healed
[58:18] that's the only value they put upon him
[58:21] amen many people got healed and God will
[58:23] heal anyone that comes to him many
[58:26] people came up before brother Branham in
[58:27] the prayer line he just prayed for them
[58:29] they got healed the respective of who
[58:31] they were saved lost whatever didn't
[58:34] matter what denomination what part of
[58:36] life what religion even he just prayed
[58:38] for them and God healed them but you got
[58:41] to go more than just so well I need ya I
[58:43] ever need in my body or even you know oh
[58:46] I want a good family or you know oh I
[58:49] want a good you know a lot of people
[58:51] they come round churches looking for a
[58:52] spouse cause I see value
[58:55] but you gotta look more than just that
[58:57] oh I want a good family therefore I'll
[59:00] be a believer it's more than that I mean
[59:03] oh I just want to you know I just want
[59:05] to have peace in my home more than that
[59:07] I mean all those things are good but
[59:09] it's more than they just like the
[59:10] promised land man fly land flowing with
[59:13] milk and honey that sounds like a good
[59:15] place but there was more value in that
[59:19] land been a land flowing with milk and
[59:20] honey but it was a spiritual that really
[59:24] caught the value of the land I mean when
[59:26] Jacob I mean I mean when when when
[59:29] Joseph when Joseph died he knew all
[59:33] about tombs you know the Egyptians built
[59:35] tombs but he told he he told us roll
[59:38] when you leave and you will leave
[59:40] because God said you're gonna leave take
[59:42] my bones don't leave them here take them
[59:46] with you when God comes and takes you
[59:48] take me out of this place I mean when
[59:51] his father died he didn't get buried in
[59:53] Egypt his he was spiritual he said go
[59:55] bury me in the promised land and he was
[59:57] buried in the Cave of Machpelah where
[1:00:00] Abraham buried Sarah and Abraham was
[1:00:02] buried in the patriarchs are buried
[1:00:03] there why because they saw the true
[1:00:06] value of the land
[1:00:09] hallelujah they saw the true value of
[1:00:11] the promise then well what do you mean
[1:00:13] what does the value meet wouldn't there
[1:00:15] be better terms in Egypt there were
[1:00:16] better tombs
[1:00:17] incredible tombs a lot of man-hours and
[1:00:20] energy went into building those things
[1:00:21] but it missed one thing there wasn't a
[1:00:24] resurrection going to happen in that
[1:00:26] land sure God is God everybody there was
[1:00:29] a resurrection happening in a certain
[1:00:30] land and that's why them who are
[1:00:32] spiritual say don't bury me here bury me
[1:00:34] there bury me over Jordan bear me in the
[1:00:37] promised land because the scripture
[1:00:39] tells us when Christ arose many of the
[1:00:41] Saints arose with him why those that
[1:00:44] were buried in the promised land where
[1:00:45] the resurrection was going to happen
[1:00:46] they died under expectation I'm not
[1:00:49] going to stay in the grave one's going
[1:00:51] to come and get me out of the grave and
[1:00:53] one did come holy and our rose when he
[1:00:55] rose why because they saw the true value
[1:00:59] of the land and it's the same thing with
[1:01:03] this message it makes nice people
[1:01:05] it makes decent human beings does it not
[1:01:08] makes good children does it not it makes

[1:02:44] and said availing him as the Lord of
[1:02:46] glory the only one that could undo it
[1:02:48] their traditions couldn't do it their
[1:02:50] sincerity couldn't do it nothing they
[1:02:52] could do could do it could actually undo
[1:02:55] the Sun curse that they were born under
[1:02:57] but that one but this one hallelujah it
[1:03:02] was walking on the grounds a man that
[1:03:04] sacrifice was there and we know that the
[1:03:06] word is Messiah hallelujah the word in
[1:03:10] every age is Messiah the word came to
[1:03:12] Noah get in the ark those that believed
[1:03:14] that it received it got on the ark what
[1:03:16] they got saved there are others perished
[1:03:19] I mean when Moses came down into Egypt
[1:03:21] that was the word coming to deliver them
[1:03:23] it was Messiah was it not oh yeah
[1:03:26] Jonathan yeah I mean I mean Elijah
[1:03:28] amount comma what was that that was
[1:03:30] Messiah coming
[1:03:31] that was a deliverance from from bail
[1:03:33] worship and idolatry in the land Messiah
[1:03:35] came the word came hallelujah his Jesus

[1:03:44] that's why you've got to believe the
[1:03:45] word and you'll receive what the
[1:03:47] messiahs amen but today people turn it
[1:03:53] into a tradition and I and I'm talking
[1:03:56] here by the way not talking about I'm
[1:03:58] not they can do what they're doing we're
[1:03:59] here we're here that's the same thing
[1:04:03] with Christians today isn't assigning a
[1:04:06] card that will come to Sunday school so
[1:04:09] many days of so many Sundays in a year
[1:04:11] it isn't taking a pledge that you won't
[1:04:13] drink no more for six months it isn't
[1:04:15] that isn't laying your hands it's laying
[1:04:17] your hands upon God's provided
[1:04:19] sacrifices pardon the heat of Jesus
[1:04:22] Christ and feeling the tears of the
[1:04:24] flesh at Calvary and then identifying
[1:04:26] yourself with him in Baptism that as he
[1:04:28] died and rose again so you had died so
[1:04:31] sorry sorry so you are buried in his
[1:04:34] name to rise in newness of life to walk
[1:04:36] as a new creature in Christ when you do
[1:04:39] it with sincerity done this Jehovah's
[1:04:42] bidding so he feels justified speaking
[1:04:44] about Jew taking a sacrifice to the
[1:04:46] temple now the Jew could be justified
[1:04:48] because he did what Joe what Jehovah bid
[1:04:51] him to do that was right Jehovah did did
[1:04:54] that and that was what he required but
[1:04:57] finally it became a family tradition
[1:05:00] that come Atonement day and maybe the
[1:05:03] Jews had been doing what was wrong and
[1:05:05] said well I believe it's a toment day I
[1:05:07] would better take my lamb down see it
[1:05:09] became a family tradition they didn't go
[1:05:12] that was sincerely they just did it
[1:05:14] because the families had done it that's
[1:05:16] just the thing we do all the families do
[1:05:18] it we should do it too and that's
[1:05:19] exactly where our Christianity has God
[1:05:22] that's just exactly where our
[1:05:23] Pentecostal movements are coming to it's
[1:05:25] a family tradition
[1:05:26] now listen someone's got to break the
[1:05:28] cycle someone's got to break that cycle
[1:05:31] of it just becoming a tradition this is
[1:05:33] not this messages
[1:05:35] the first generation comes in with a
[1:05:36] ball of flame and God living and
[1:05:38] vindicating himself and signs and
[1:05:40] miracles and wonders in the next
[1:05:42] generation comes in and just conforms to
[1:05:44] it this is not what this is not why
[1:05:46] we're here every generation must have
[1:05:49] its own revival you say well are you
[1:05:51] trying to put a push of Supernatural
[1:05:53] Pentecostal gospel absolutely because
[1:05:56] you're going to understand God doesn't
[1:05:58] subtract right Luther came with
[1:06:00] justification the just shall live by
[1:06:02] faith and then Wesley came with
[1:06:04] signification did God do away with
[1:06:07] justification no right hallelujah and
[1:06:10] then the Pentecostals came with the
[1:06:12] restoration of the gifts did God do well
[1:06:14] sent if occasion just occasion no he
[1:06:16] added to it and now when the word comes
[1:06:18] himself hallelujah he doesn't take away
[1:06:21] with what has done it just actually
[1:06:23] magnifies what has been hallelujah so
[1:06:26] absolutely God is a God of the
[1:06:28] supernatural hallelujah his word has
[1:06:31] always been supernatural I mean when
[1:06:33] it's received into a sincere heart with
[1:06:35] faith it will produce a supernatural
[1:06:37] life hallelujah say yes I am pushing us
[1:06:41] supernatural Pentecostal gospel right
[1:06:44] because it's all part of it knowing who
[1:06:46] you are an adoption it's all part of it
[1:06:48] B don't take away with the first things
[1:06:50] hallelujah right isn't that right Amen
[1:06:54] sir someone's gotta break the cycle amen
[1:06:59] no see that's exactly where our
[1:07:01] Pentecostal movements are coming to it's
[1:07:03] a family tradition see when I talk about
[1:07:05] Pentecost I don't talk about Azusa
[1:07:07] Street Pentecost I talk about the
[1:07:09] original God coming and dwelling in his
[1:07:11] people more than just an anointing but
[1:07:14] God dwelling in the soul of the believer
[1:07:17] walking in them for filling us word you
[1:07:19] take the Book of X it's the Acts of the
[1:07:21] Holy Spirit
[1:07:22] and the Apostles that's the book of Acts
[1:07:24] the Gospels are the scaffold work but
[1:07:27] the book of Acts records the life on
[1:07:29] display a man a brother am says that
[1:07:32] this this last day there'll be another
[1:07:34] book of Acts written hallelujah and here
[1:07:38] you are in this day hallelujah
[1:07:39] so the life of God and you will write a
[1:07:41] book of Acts you don't have to try at
[1:07:43] will his life will do it why cuz the
[1:07:46] word is manifesting
[1:07:48] hallelujah so when the seals come up and
[1:07:51] what they're to do it released a part of
[1:07:52] the church to break the cycle of revival
[1:07:54] and death how why I just jumped in so
[1:07:57] here we are well how could you because
[1:07:59] the reason the reason the Ephesian
[1:08:00] Church for a seasoned member of the you
[1:08:03] know in the book of Acts for a season
[1:08:04] the church was at its first love there
[1:08:07] was a season where the Antichrist spirit
[1:08:10] had not come in to file it was in
[1:08:12] perfect harmony with the bridegroom but
[1:08:14] it didn't have the book open it had to
[1:08:18] and then it became the Ephesian Church
[1:08:20] age around 80 50 something why but then
[1:08:24] but then the first complaint against
[1:08:25] that age was you have left your first
[1:08:27] love
[1:08:27] so that church had already fallen from a
[1:08:30] place wiping and we know Ephesus means
[1:08:34] aimed at and relaxed so they aimed at
[1:08:36] the high call in Christ but they relaxed
[1:08:38] I mean so they then obtained what they
[1:08:41] were aiming to become and so then it
[1:08:44] eventually went down to the dark ages we
[1:08:46] know God said I will restore hallelujah
[1:08:49] but now God has to send a power to the
[1:08:52] church that will break that cycle that
[1:08:55] we don't just come back to where the
[1:08:56] Ephesians were and then I met relaxing
[1:08:59] go back down because there's no more
[1:09:00] Church ages we're at the end God must
[1:09:02] restore his bride right so now God has
[1:09:05] to send a power to the church is going
[1:09:06] to send a word into the church that will
[1:09:08] break that cycle that we don't just come
[1:09:10] back to where they were in the first
[1:09:12] church but we ascend right hallelujah
[1:09:16] so now it says in Hebrews 1 and 1 yeah
[1:09:19] we got opens his word it brings a
[1:09:21] revival every revival is caused by an
[1:09:24] opening of the word amen now we read
[1:09:29] Hebrews 1 and 3 he says who being in the
[1:09:34] brightness of his glory and the Express
[1:09:38] image of his person and upholding all
[1:09:40] things by the word of his power when he
[1:09:43] had himself purged our sins sat down on
[1:09:45] the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:09:47] now notice it says upholding all things
[1:09:50] by the word of his power so not by the
[1:09:53] I'm just this is not a twist of words
[1:09:56] but it does not say the power of his
[1:09:58] word but it's the word of as
[1:10:00] power so when when his word is released
[1:10:04] it releases a power amen
[1:10:07] when Moses went down into Egypt and
[1:10:09] released his word God's Word released a
[1:10:11] power that took the people from slavery
[1:10:14] into sonship
[1:10:15] right and took them from slavery in
[1:10:17] Egypt I mean he God released his word
[1:10:20] which released an anointing of power
[1:10:21] upon the people those who received that
[1:10:23] word became placed as sons in in the
[1:10:26] promised land
[1:10:27] you take Caleb and Joshua they were
[1:10:29] slaves right they they heard the same
[1:10:31] thing scorned atha hood but because they
[1:10:33] received it in faith it actually
[1:10:35] translated them from being slaves then
[1:10:38] Caleb's hip give me my Mountain and the
[1:10:39] reason he could say that is because a
[1:10:41] POW was released to him by the word and
[1:10:44] that day they said now this is mine as
[1:10:46] inheritance his mind and he received
[1:10:48] that inheritance why because God's
[1:10:50] released his power through his word
[1:10:54] hallelujah amen
[1:10:57] every age is the same thing how did
[1:11:00] Luther come out receive powder came out
[1:11:03] of Catholicism it was quickened to him
[1:11:05] the just shall live by faith the
[1:11:06] Reformation was on Wesley the same
[1:11:09] way--with he was reading Luther's Co
[1:11:11] mature in the book of Romans he says is
[1:11:13] a warming in his heart
[1:11:14] what happened there's a power released
[1:11:16] hallelujah and we come all the way down
[1:11:19] here down to this age finally God has
[1:11:21] opened his word he's loose the seals off
[1:11:23] the book hallelujah which is released
[1:11:26] the seven thunders to us and brother
[1:11:28] mjozwell what are the seven thunders
[1:11:30] they are the revelation of the seven
[1:11:31] seals I mean so as the work comes open
[1:11:34] it releases a power to you hallelujah
[1:11:37] which gives you an overcoming walk
[1:11:40] hallelujah basically what a what you
[1:11:43] should be doing right now as you say now
[1:11:45] that's why I kick the devil down I'm
[1:11:48] just I'm just giving you explanation
[1:11:50] just like you read the book of Ephesians
[1:11:52] Paul is telling the Ephesians what they
[1:11:54] have and where they're going he says he
[1:11:57] says you heard you believed you trusted
[1:11:59] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:12:01] you're quicker and you once walked
[1:12:02] according to the Prince of power of the
[1:12:04] year but you're quickened you're alive
[1:12:05] you don't do that anymore you came out
[1:12:07] from darkness now in glorious light and
[1:12:10] this is where we're going but they had
[1:12:11] already had those experiences they were
[1:12:13] already sealed into
[1:12:14] Kingdom but Paul was saying this is what
[1:12:16] happened to you hallelujah well why are
[1:12:19] you saying the same thing because you
[1:12:20] got to realize what God has done for you
[1:12:22] but not just stay there you got to walk
[1:12:24] on I mean because Gideon the angel came
[1:12:27] to Gideon he says you're a mighty man of
[1:12:29] Valor go and I might so he had been
[1:12:33] awakened there was there was a revival
[1:12:35] on but now you've got actually go under
[1:12:38] the effects of that revival you
[1:12:41] following me I mean because it's well
[1:12:43] you know the brighter revival is on
[1:12:44] hallelujah absolutely it is brother
[1:12:47] Brahim says in the third seal there's
[1:12:48] been nothing to stir the bride there's
[1:12:50] been millions come and denomination all
[1:12:52] kinds of things but nothing has has been
[1:12:54] seen to stir the bride yet he says he'll
[1:12:56] take those seven unknown thunders to
[1:12:59] wake her up see the bride hasn't had a
[1:13:02] revival you see there's been no revival
[1:13:04] there no manifestation of God to show
[1:13:06] the bride yet we're looking for it now
[1:13:08] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:13:10] back there to wake her up again yeah
[1:13:11] he'll send it he promised it now watch
[1:13:13] and then so that's a 1963 than a 1964
[1:13:18] he's asked the question have the seven
[1:13:19] thunders I mean have the seven thunders
[1:13:21] which equals seven mysteries already
[1:13:23] been revealed were they revealed in the
[1:13:25] seven seals but as yet but are not known
[1:13:27] to us as the thunders yet brother Graham
[1:13:29] says no they were revealed in the seven
[1:13:32] seals that's what the thunders was about
[1:13:34] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[1:13:36] had uttered their voices and no one
[1:13:38] could make out what it was John knew
[1:13:40] what it was but is forbidden to ride he
[1:13:42] said but the seventh angel the days of a
[1:13:43] sounding the seven mysteries of the
[1:13:45] seven thunders would be revealed in the
[1:13:47] seventh angel as a messenger of the
[1:13:48] seventh church age so he so he's saying
[1:13:51] when the seals are coming up he says
[1:13:52] well there hasn't been a you know those
[1:13:54] seven thunders haven't add their voices
[1:13:56] yet to stir the bride but once the book
[1:13:58] somebody says no it's happened
[1:14:00] hallelujah
[1:14:01] she says there's nothing that I would
[1:14:02] stir the bride yet but now since it has
[1:14:04] happened this is there's been a word
[1:14:06] released into the earth to stir the
[1:14:07] bride and that's why it's gripped your
[1:14:10] soul and because it's sent to stir a
[1:14:12] bride has seemed to awaken a bride to
[1:14:14] who she is hallelujah
[1:14:18] amen say well what does this got to do
[1:14:23] with Gideon everything because Gideon
[1:14:26] had to be awakened to who he was
[1:14:28] then he could go into action and
[1:14:30] actually redeem his inheritance from
[1:14:32] under the hands of the Midianites and
[1:14:34] it's the same thing with you and I
[1:14:36] friends we are not just threshing wheat
[1:14:39] and secret just all just yo real listen
[1:14:41] to the message in secret and read my
[1:14:43] Bible in secret and keep my walk
[1:14:44] personal and you know or your all your
[1:14:47] the enemies all around it's so dark but
[1:14:48] I'll just stay in my cave and I'm just
[1:14:50] gonna read this and keep it to myself no
[1:14:52] no no no if life has come life must be
[1:14:56] expressed if the word has come in has
[1:14:58] got to be expressed and you can't help
[1:15:00] but living because God has a life of his
[1:15:02] own so will impact those around you and
[1:15:05] you'll have a burden your I'm not
[1:15:08] willing just to stay as I am hallelujah
[1:15:12] God was God told Gideon there are a
[1:15:15] mighty man of Valor and then God
[1:15:17] actually sent them forth and say I'm
[1:15:19] gonna prove it to you and it's the same
[1:15:22] thing with you and I you know your
[1:15:23] mighty men and woman of Valor why don't
[1:15:26] you go in my might go in your mind here
[1:15:29] it was threshing wheat and secret GaN
[1:15:30] you're my god system God in your mind
[1:15:33] didn't say your weakness your might and
[1:15:35] Gideon's like what do you mean Here I am
[1:15:37] hiding out now you've got mighty power
[1:15:41] you don't know you have it but you've
[1:15:44] got to put it into action you gotta let
[1:15:45] God use it
[1:15:47] hallelujah be available amen
[1:15:52] so Gideon is instructed by the Lord to
[1:15:55] go the first thing he had to do was get
[1:15:58] rid of the idol out of his father's
[1:15:59] house that thing that had become very
[1:16:02] much a permanent fixture there had to be
[1:16:04] hewed down because why becoming an being
[1:16:08] an Israelite was just a tradition that
[1:16:11] my father's father's father's father was
[1:16:13] so-and-so and this is where I live and
[1:16:15] this is what we do and you know people
[1:16:17] become creatures of habit and the devil
[1:16:20] wants us just to be creatures of habit
[1:16:23] come to church listen to the message
[1:16:26] read the Bible discuss things where's
[1:16:29] the life
[1:16:30] hey with me it's all good to read and
[1:16:33] listen and and talk about the word we
[1:16:35] must do those things but we but the
[1:16:39] bride in this hour doesn't just have
[1:16:41] Kennex we need mechanics right we need
[1:16:43] order but we need the dynamics to come I
[1:16:46] mean to make the mechanics go hallelujah
[1:16:50] and ultimately who is the mechanics
[1:16:51] you're the mechanics I mean but God has
[1:16:54] to come and fire you off I mean you can
[1:16:56] actually go forward and I'm not saying
[1:16:58] that you don't have it but put it into
[1:17:01] action
[1:17:02] see you know if the devil can cut your
[1:17:05] prayer life if he can make you thinking
[1:17:07] negative about yourself if he can get
[1:17:09] you thinking negative about people or
[1:17:11] whatever it may be he's got you don't
[1:17:14] look at your see Gideon was looking at a
[1:17:17] situation he was not looking at what God
[1:17:20] made him to be hallelujah he was looking
[1:17:22] at a situation of this is going on this
[1:17:24] is wrong and listen listen this what
[1:17:27] about who he was what about who you were
[1:17:30] hallelujah we shouldn't just sit around
[1:17:33] and just you know someone's got to break
[1:17:38] the cycle well we've been here for years
[1:17:41] no who cares about the years
[1:17:44] Moses is on the back side doesn't
[1:17:46] backside the desert living under a
[1:17:48] promise for 40 years but he had to meet
[1:17:51] an angel it had to become alive and it's
[1:17:54] the same thing with you and I this is
[1:17:56] not just a you know this this Christian
[1:17:59] walk is not well my parents have a
[1:18:01] testimony and you know and I just agree
[1:18:04] with their thinking and therefore no no
[1:18:05] you've got to meet him yourself you must
[1:18:08] absolutely meet him yourself hello it's
[1:18:11] not just going well you know can I'm
[1:18:13] doing this is a tradition a tradition as
[1:18:16] well some it's a form of behavior it's a
[1:18:20] form of behavior that's been passed down
[1:18:23] why do we celebrate Christmas like we do
[1:18:25] it's been passed down why do we
[1:18:28] celebrate Easter it's been passed down I
[1:18:31] could say why do we even read this it's
[1:18:34] been passed down it's got to go more
[1:18:37] than why do you listen to the message
[1:18:38] many of us it's been passed down it's
[1:18:41] got to go beyond that it's got to go
[1:18:44] beyond that it's got to be alive to you
[1:18:46] and the reason you listen to it is not
[1:18:48] because mummy and daddy and great-uncle
[1:18:50] whatever whatever you know no it's you
[1:18:53] and God
[1:18:54] it was Gideon and God it wasn't Gideon
[1:18:57] other people as Gideon and God
[1:18:59] hallelujah
[1:19:02] it's got to be that way
[1:19:08] well the brim season the exposition of
[1:19:10] seven Church ages and this is formally
[1:19:12] seized let me show you another reason
[1:19:14] why Satan hates this book of the
[1:19:16] revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:19:18] it's very important he sees it's in the
[1:19:20] church the book of Revelation is a
[1:19:22] bride's book a mint you want to know
[1:19:25] where you are in time look at the book
[1:19:27] of Revelation that's why we had the
[1:19:29] seventh angels ministry was to open the
[1:19:31] book of Revelation as to show you
[1:19:32] because it's a book of inheritance well
[1:19:35] how is it well the devil in here is the
[1:19:37] lake of fire the beast in here it's the
[1:19:39] lake of fire that's their portion right
[1:19:41] the Jews receive what they receive the
[1:19:42] bride receives New Jerusalem those and
[1:19:45] and others receive an inheritance round
[1:19:47] the outside the city it's all the book
[1:19:48] of inheritance hallelujah but so you got
[1:19:51] to see now what's mine do you do that oh
[1:19:54] you know you know we shouldn't be
[1:19:56] stumbling along blindly just reacting
[1:19:59] the devil comes in all it's wrecked this
[1:20:01] person sick oh let's wreck other the
[1:20:03] spirit does this all its wrecked
[1:20:05] we shouldn't be that way the devil
[1:20:07] should be reacted the devil should be
[1:20:09] guessing what the bride is gonna do
[1:20:12] hallelujah isn't that right he should be
[1:20:14] wake it all yo you always got some
[1:20:16] little devil watching oh they're awake
[1:20:18] breaker breaker when they're gonna do
[1:20:20] today you know oh they're awake oh no
[1:20:22] you know what are they gonna do it
[1:20:25] shouldn't be well they're so predictable
[1:20:27] you know no pray you know I mean don't
[1:20:34] put God in the box don't put your walk
[1:20:36] in a box you know the devil should be
[1:20:39] guessing what are they gonna do today
[1:20:41] hallelujah
[1:20:42] any and and the devil will try and stop
[1:20:45] you doing what you want to do every day
[1:20:47] why do you think the Edict when doubted
[1:20:48] to stop Daniel praying here was a man
[1:20:51] calling upon God and it wasn't just
[1:20:54] words of the year finally yet the angel
[1:20:56] came to him and won't he say you're
[1:20:58] highly beloved you're highly loved
[1:21:00] that's what the angel first said to him
[1:21:02] so therefore because you're highly loved
[1:21:03] I'm going to show you the time of the
[1:21:04] end in the book how that you know where
[1:21:06] you are and you know
[1:21:07] it's gonna happen all the way down
[1:21:08] through and that's why how we know we're
[1:21:10] high love God says I'm gonna show you
[1:21:12] what's in the book I'm gonna show you
[1:21:14] who you are
[1:21:15] hallelujah where you are and where
[1:21:17] you're going and what you got to do to
[1:21:18] get there
[1:21:20] hallelujah isn't that right that's why
[1:21:23] we need to pray for revelation more than
[1:21:24] anything
[1:21:27] amen amen
[1:21:31] this book of the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ in the church he knows that Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:21:37] forever and he changes not he knows us a
[1:21:39] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:21:41] theologians he knows that since God is
[1:21:43] immutable in his nature and he's just as
[1:21:45] immutable in his ways the Satan knows us
[1:21:47] surely that the original Church at
[1:21:49] Pentecost were the power of God mark 16
[1:21:51] in action is the true church that Jesus
[1:21:54] claims as his own all houses false it
[1:21:56] has to be now remember this Christ and
[1:21:59] the true church is a continuation of the
[1:22:00] book of Acts but the book of Revelation
[1:22:03] shows how the Antichrist spirit would
[1:22:05] come into the church and defile it make
[1:22:07] it lukewarm formal and powerless that
[1:22:09] exposes Satan revealing his works which
[1:22:12] is the attempted destruction of God's
[1:22:13] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:22:16] Word right down to the time when he's
[1:22:18] cast into the lake of fire
[1:22:19] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:22:22] knows that if the people get the true
[1:22:24] revelation of the true church what she
[1:22:26] stands for I mean what she is and what
[1:22:28] she stands for that she can do the
[1:22:30] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:22:33] army and what does the devil what the
[1:22:35] devil doesn't want you to get that
[1:22:36] revelation amen that's like that's like
[1:22:40] God know this is a very crude way of
[1:22:41] saying first life God wants to send you
[1:22:43] a package and the devil knows if you get
[1:22:46] that package he's defeated do you think
[1:22:49] he's going to not try and stop it why
[1:22:54] that's why you've got that's why tries
[1:22:55] to cut your prayer life take the
[1:22:57] sweetness of the Holy Ghost out of your
[1:22:58] life getting you're looking at
[1:23:00] circumstance and not at the Word of God
[1:23:01] getting you worried about things worried
[1:23:03] has helped no one faith has helped a lot
[1:23:08] of people Hebrews 11 chapters not by
[1:23:14] worry it's by faith
[1:23:16] they say well it's very easy to worry
[1:23:18] yet us we're human but you gotta cast
[1:23:21] down reasoning you got to realize Dodds
[1:23:23] and control of all things at all times
[1:23:25] it's never a toccata as better it's
[1:23:28] never out of his hands he knows exactly
[1:23:30] what's going on and prayer is actually
[1:23:33] for us for God to change our mind that's
[1:23:37] what real I think brother and
[1:23:38] appreciator you know prayer meeting real
[1:23:40] prayer is God changing our minds to
[1:23:42] matches word that's not now you know God
[1:23:46] is not our errand boy they should be in
[1:23:49] prayer Lord changed my mind to match
[1:23:51] your word because when we're in harmony
[1:23:53] then God can work well I think Jesus
[1:23:55] spent so much time in prayer to stand
[1:23:57] how many with the God that was in him
[1:23:59] hallelujah what does that mean our gonna
[1:24:03] spend our sometimes you might it might
[1:24:05] just be five seconds God comes down you
[1:24:08] just pray you for your peace come ease
[1:24:10] God's heard your prayer you go on so you
[1:24:13] don't have to put a time you know God
[1:24:14] can come in a moment or whatever you
[1:24:16] know what I mean hallelujah now he knows
[1:24:20] that note so she'll be an invincible
[1:24:22] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:24:24] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:24:26] the Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[1:24:28] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:24:30] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:24:32] her he'll be definitely thought that
[1:24:34] today as when Christ was stood as every
[1:24:36] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:24:37] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[1:24:40] love it with true revelation in our
[1:24:42] lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:24:44] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:24:47] hallelujah amen
[1:24:50] now the Apostle Paul he knew exactly who
[1:24:59] he was why an angel came to him
[1:25:02] hallelujah more than once you know here
[1:25:05] he was on the ship you know there were
[1:25:07] fourteen days whatever in a storm

[1:25:17] not no one's going to die it's just the
[1:25:20] boats gonna be destroyed hallelujah so
[1:25:23] he knew who he was because the angel
[1:25:25] Lord came to him you say but that's a
[1:25:27] messenger to an age the same angel can
[1:25:30] come to you brother Brown says you feel
[1:25:32] that sweet humble feeling come over you
