stands it starts with the musicians amen actually it starts with you at home praying that's right for for everything amen so I greet you tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ um while we standing let's just read Matthew chapter 11 um good to see each one of each one of you m week service amen we won't be long tonight let's just read Matthew chapter 11 I prefer to read it in here Matthew 11 once you are there just say amen hallelujah let's read verse 28 come unto me all all ye that labor and heavy and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me me for I am meek and lowly in heart ye shall find rest unto your souls let's just pray our most gracious Eternal loving Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord as we approach your word we have read Lord we pray that heavenly father that you'll bless it that you'll anoint it Lord that you inspire both speaker and hearer that you inspire all the hearts tonight Lord Jesus we standing here Lord realizing that it's a great privilege to be in your presence we don't want to take it for granted we don't want to take it lightly father I pray heavenly father that you come and be the speaker to your children tonight because I can do it Lord without without you there's nothing that I can offer your people that is why heavenly father I also need you to preach unto me this evening Lord as we come lifting our hearts together may you just make us to be in one Accord Lord May the Holy Spirit just take over and you have preeminence in the service tonight I pray heavenly father that if there's any burdens Among Us because we are needy people father that you can provide for your people you are the god of hearts and you understand our situations you understand everything I commit these people and the rest of the service into your hands father Lord you don't want to forget to ask you to forgive us our mistakes our childishness sometimes Lord our Folly Lord our our GI build even the secret ones as brother Ben always prays father I pray that you forgive us and wash us clean because we are standing in a sacred place in the presence of the Living God father we humble ourselves now as we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen please enjoy the comfort of your seats and uh the scripture that we have read tonight you know we we we we we realize that the Lord Jesus Christ is calling he's saying come eh he's saying come if we read the end of that line he also says I will give you rest so he's saying come and then I'll give you rest he will there's something that you must do you must come and then he will give you rest can you see can you see it's not just saying come just find yourself make yourself comfortable no no he will give you rest when you come to my house house and then I say oh come in and I even show you this is your room you'll sleep in this room this is the kitchen can you see I'm giving you rest you can sit here this is where the food are you will can take the snakes everything you see so because now I'm welcoming you the Lord Jesus is not just saying come and not give you rest amen so that's the the spirit of that scripture that we have read because tonight I would like us to talk about God of opportunities H I want us to just for a little bit of time because we have to understand that we need to respect the time that we allocate to come to church because it's a very important thing I mean you have left so many things out there that some of them could have given you probably H more uh Earthly benefits you know they could have benefited you in some way or the other on the flesh but you have left everything because you recognized that tonight you want to be in the presence of God you want to Fellowship so while we are here just allow yourself to take this opportunity to use this opportunity for a little bit and hear a few words then we go home won't that be lovely to be blessed by God just not to lose the opportunity that is why tonight I would like us to talk a little bit about God this God because he's a god of opportun opportunities so my children when I say opportun they say nities to show we on the same page so this this God he's a God who gives opportunities he even he even giv his enemy opportunities he he gave opportunities to his enemy many times all over the Bible so let's just look at him tonight and just recognize wow I didn't see that way he's a god of opportunities the fact that you are here is a great opportunity that you have taken with two hands amen so let's just let's just what what is an opportunity they say it's an this is now Cambridge uh that other dictionary not Oxford mar maram mar but it's called Cambridge inside that that's the dictionary that one I'm talking about that's the explanation the explanation of what opportunity is is a favorable juncture of circumstance it's a juncture a favorable one of a circumstance in other words you are presented or you come across a favorable juncture in your circumstances that is called an opportunity are we together they also say it's a good chance for advancement or progress you know sometimes if we can expand on these things we just think oh I know what an opportunity is no no we we need to to understand um what and opportunity can be because if you don't you can miss it Hallelujah God he he even gave Cain an opportunity remember because he's a god of opportunities he said and the Lord said unto Cain why are thou Roth and why is thy countenance Fallen H why if thou does well shall thou not be accepted that's that's very clear by implication that go what God is telling K what's the guy Kane is that if you do well like your brother you will be accepted my door is open and God knows very well that this guy this guy can't do it he he's not deser designed to do that so he missed that opportunity came he missed it and if thou dust not that's not thou do not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall Ru shall rule over him so there's a there's a problem when we don't take opportunities because sin could be like around the corner when we take we don't take God's opportunity we lose what he's trying to give us and what is lying around the corner so don't lose it that opportunity let's just continue a little bit I want you to to think about but what about brother when when when when the when is not an opportunity from God you are dead right my brother my sister my friend the devil also can present an opportunity but remember there there's there's two outcomes of these opportunities the enemy can present what looks like an opportunity it's not really an opportunity it's something that is going to hurt you something that is going to harm you something that is going to make you disbelieve God is not an opportunity per se the one from the devil but the one from God has got eternal life that is why we come by faith to take the opportunity from God so which means for you and I to know and to understand we must get a discernment from God he must give us a heart and a spirit of discernment to see that this is the opportunity from my Lord I take it by faith and I go and it shall come to pass amen so I have here I said many time we view problems trials Temptations sickness many forms of suffering threats hunger riches plenty poverty as they are we just view them as those things that I've just read we view them like that but we fail to understand brothers and sisters that those things could be opportunities when when I suddenly start to have a lot of money and I'm a Son of God I can I can start to boast and miss the opportunity I can start to be pompers and miss the opportunity but maybe God was giving me to be a benefit to his economy maybe God was giving me to see whether I'll be like Solomon or not maybe God was giving me to see whether I'll be like Abraham but I missed opportunity because Abraham became but he was still humble I'm told when I read in some of the history um that's not recorded in the Bible I'm not sure if it's I didn't verify it but I was reading a Jewish history they say Abraham he was so rich that he had a guest house you know when pilgrims and strangers come from a far off passing by him just like melkisedek he saw him coming from a far off you know when he those people will come in this get guest house of Abraham and they will dwell for free for Mahala Mahala means free they will stay for free they will be what in the guest house so he was rich but humble so it was a great opportunity for Abraham but when me and you get those things how do we view them sickness you making it very hard now how can sickness you say I must call it an opportunity of course it is an opportunity remember I didn't say the sweet and sour opportunities I just said opportunities God is a god of opportunity bear in mind my brothers and sisters that God has got no problem go God in God's vocabulary there's nothing like oh this is too much of a problem how can I handle this God has got no problems but why is he bringing diseases he allows the devil to bring diseases or tiles to to me because those are problems which means those things are not to a Son of God and a daughter of God those things are opportunities something must come out of me being sick me being poor me being rich me being hurt me being h h h disobeyed me being H you know betrayed me being hated me having having you know everything to a son and a daughter of God if it comes your way is an opportunity that God brings to you amen because look look I don't know why my classes don't want to see sister Talia can I increase this this thing or maybe I should put it like this no I'll leave it this way oh thank you it looks better now thank you sister listen to what James says James chapter 2 James chapter 1 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse Temptations knowing these that the trying of your faith WTH patience but let patience have her perfect way work that ye may be perfect and and and entire wanting nothing so there you go there you have it my brothers and sisters take it all as Joy when all form of Things Fall unto you because you are special people you see you have to realize that you are a son and a daughter of king of of the king you are not just an ordinary person and that is why you are an odd ball you you're not an ordinary ball a son and a daughter of God does not interpret things the way the world does a son and a daughter of God does not say but why why me why do you choose why this me Jenny why why me no he says Lord thank you for yet another opportunity because David said the Lord is my shepherd though I can walk on the valy of the shadow of death death a Son of God Walk on the valy of the shadow of the that is an opportunity because he walks right there with you you see so anything that comes to you an unbeliever can cry a helpless cry because he doesn't see that he's not predestinated to see a problem as a an opportunity it doesn't matter an opportunity to you but to someone is not an opportunity that is why when the word of God is preached some some it can destroy some it gives life can you see this so we need to be able to discern am I am I pronouncing it right discernment to discern when things happens to us and our attitude towards the things that happens to us will actually determine the outcome the results because you are a son of God you are a daughter of God Amen but the devil always present this those things he present them differently because his main aim is to discredit God and he that's why he discrediting you when you see the devil attacking you you must know that ah he's just confirming that I'm a Son of God he's confirming my opportunities that he wants to show me something different from what God shows me so the devil will present that thing as a problem are we together are you listening to me yes the the devil will present that thing as something different he'll present it as a problem as ah they hate you as ah you are unlucky oh you've got this this you all sorts of things are we together that's how the devil presents his can I say also the devil he he takes opportunities even those ones that don't belong to him because he's a thief you know that he's a thief he's a robber he just want to H to destroy and to to steal so he's actually he's very opport opportunistic the devil very opportunistic if he can see that you are not realizing your opportunity he'll grab it and then he'll change it brings it to you from the oven of Hell changed to you and you believe him so let's let us realize our opportunities and not miss them and not allow them to be in the hands of the devil let's know that who we are the devil cannot determine who you are and me are are we together but God um I mean the devil let me just sit on him for a little bit H he will even blame make you to blame yourself the enemy he'll even make something that was supposed to be an opportunity for you he'll turn it around if you especially if you give him a lot of air time and then he will turn that around for you to blame yourself for you to feel guilty excuse me to feel hurt to feel pain to feel all sorts of things and even blame yourself and blame your brothers and sisters when he's finished with blaming brothers and sisters he make you to blame yourself for what how can God save you for you to blame yourself God the author and finisher and the one who knew you from the beginning he had a plan of your life and everything he saw you so me and you cannot turn around and and say ah I'm so stupid I shouldn't have done that if God allowed it look at it differently it's an opportunity the only thing ask God God how is this going going to be a blessing to me how is this going to be a blessing to my brother to my sister sometimes things happen among us to some of us and we miss the opportunity for me to pray for that person or to love that person more you miss it because the enemy cooked it for you and spiced it and presented to you in a plate and then I received it when it was supposed to be a blessing when it was when it was a Godly opportunity are you are you following me I want to try to be a little bit slow so if God present what clearly looks like a problem to you you must just know that it's actually not a problem it's an opportunity amen let's just look at a few things that uh the things that a people of God will take you know I'm saying here a few common things about people who takes God's opportunities just a few things because I I wrote by faith you you need to take God's Opportunity by faith you you apply Faith did you hear the scripture for James can I read it again where I read where James said James here because this one is a bit small for me my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse Temptations knowing these that the tri of your faith [Music] huh work patience but let patience have her perfect work that he may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so you have to apply faith in every opportunity that God gives you I'll show you examples okay I'll show you examples but before I show you the examples let's just look here some of the things that the people of God people who takes God's opportunities more let's look at what is generally common with those people those people they are ready to go against popular demand or majority they may not go with the majority because straight is the gate and the narrow is the so they they don't necessarily follow the majority because the majority is actually is not is not always right did you know that this whole world uses what they call majority rules in what they call Democratic systems but majority is not always right it's not always right the Bible said it that there's so many the majority is going on the on the other Road the majority so if majority rules then we are in trouble Rob if the majority rules and the many is the is the road of the majority they go through the and we following the majority so don't always follow majority but the point I'm trying to show you is that what is generally common with the people who take God's opportunities they don't always follow majority and they don't follow popular demand what is popular what is trending no we don't go according to what is trending we are looking for God's opportunity what is he saying they also they also prepared to die they're prepared to die to die not even for themselves only but for for their brothers and their sisters they're prepared to die are you are you prepared to die for me I'm prepared to die for you to die so that my brother can live it's a strong statement but you need to do what brother maras taught usanagi he said put on your your SP spiritual jacket H put on your spiritual jacket and understand have a discernment what I'm trying to to show you or to share with you those people are prepared to die they are prepared to die for God's opportunity to take place in their lives you'll see when I give you examples now they are prepared to be criticized because when you are criticized by many that means you're not you may not be popular because there will be narrative that ah this guy is this way this you know so to be criticized is not a nice thing to be criticized but hey it's a wonderful opportunity even some people in the world they can tell you that oh to be criticized helps helps you to grow you know it helps you to be criticized even if you get someone who who H does not criticize you constructively criticize you to to break you brother Kuan he criticize you he just he just find fault with anything like that guy at the hospital there if you if you can see the brother Kuban he'll give you a testimony like that guy at the hospital just for you to come through the door you are already wrong that's how the devil you use me and you yeah so the devil is actually a very important element in my life and your life because it's an instrument that God put in our lives to show who God is to show who we are the devil okay let's just move on so that we can R up they're not afraid to be criticized uh let's just look at a just a few examples of what I'm talking about and and look at a man like Abraham he was given an opportunity when God called him you know God called Abraham Abraham was not worshiping God but God just came to him and gave him this opportunity but Abraham used Faith he just trusted in God against All Odds he just believed God how can you leave now I just wake up in the morning I I said sisteri God said I must just wake up and walk we just go here we going here he says honey that is South Ireland we will pass and get to the South Pole there's no life there I said no God God said I must take my family and go there you think she'll she'll think I'm normal you see so when God speak to you and ask you this is what I want you to do and you hear this is God you connect with him the spirit you descend that you do it amen Our Father Abraham did it let's look at the other another another example three Hebrew boys they were prepared to die in fact they said brother calling they said it's okay even if our God does not save us you see when you come to that point when you come to that point are we together brothers and sisters when when you get to that point where you say even if my God does not heal me I will not obey you Satan you are like you like the three Hebrew boys right so that is the example I was showing you I was telling you earlier on saying that those people are prepared to die let's stop talking amen so so those people they do that and they are prepared to die for God because they don't want to lose this opportunity amen and then there also example of Judas you see Judas Judas he had an opportunity but he missed it because he was predestinated that way he he stood in the presence of God Mama PR he stood there and God even the Lord even said ah one of you is going to betray me even him instead of saying oh Lord me I Repent it's me and be vulnerable and confess and say my father pray for me forgive me I've done this thing in secret now I'm exposed no he didn't do that he still he still connived with him within himself and then but that was an opportunity was it not sister for for me I'll be like brother Bram one day those people who came when he was in Houston Texas you know they came and they said today William bham is going to be exposed he said yeah I I I want to be exposed because if you're exposing something wrong that means there's no God in Me So expose it I want God to expose everything in me that is not of him so it's not actually actually God if he does that he's not exposing you he has exposing the devil who happen to hide like that TI remember many mons ago I told you about that TI the ti that lies there in a a parasite it just like makes himself part of the skin Sometimes some demons can sit like that sister Vanessa and and God is just exposing them and the devil says Ah God is hating you no God is Not hitting you he's just removing that TI which is that TI is like holding it says I'll rather die demon that's how demons behave so when God present an opportunity like the three Hebrew boys take it amen I've written down the list down the Judas missed it Cain missed it what about the four Lio lios liosis those men that were outside of the city huh remember them in the book of kings and they said oh for us those guys are such an inspiration they said you know what there is food there and that's the only thing that's going to make us live because if we sit here we're going to die and even if we go there they kill us we were still going to to die so death there's a word they use in English what do they say it's unavoidable but there's another we you know they knew that they have it this they are prepared to Die James is everything still okay here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank thank you sir the moment you are prepared to die and you let your life go that's when you save it that's actually when you get your life back and plus and and and and in in the in the the young people they say and and and the list is loading you know that language they say it's loading so let's just go to one more slide then we will be finishing soon my time is just gone past 20 past 8 so I'll finish then to have a prayer meeting when there's a trial and a mistake as a child of God that's an opportunity when there's a mistake because you will do mistakes and you will be hurt and you will be tied God is not going to let you let you give the enemy the credit and just let you come easily no God is not like that God does not have a you know those cookie cutters you just cut cut cut cut cut in in in heaven in in no God want us to be tried because he's actually trying part of himself that is that he put in you are you together so so so I'm saying here that when you face a trial take it with patience you view it as an opportunity even if it's a mistake even if it's a mistake that you did it with open eyes that I'm doing this one you see this now now I'm getting into this sin and you get in a Son of God and you get in there and then God Saves you God wants you when you are out and you're washed you're covered with the blood him because he doesn't see that anymore it's as if you have never done it he wants you to look at yourself the way he looks at you did you hear me that's a key learning point God wants you to look at yourself the way he looks at you that's a good point to know there he doesn't want you to look at yourself the way d looks at you because they tomorrow changes and say good boy tomorrow he says what the boy because that is human today you're my good friend tomorrow I say ah mama oh I say ah brother mishak how can of all the people but yesterday I was praising you saying my my fellow African from Kenya ah from Eastern Kenya I'm holding the south of Africa you are holding East so praising you then I come tomorrow I say oh no brother Mish you can't do that to me you're acting like my enemies me the same guy but not God once a friend with God he keeps you that way God doesn't change politicians change politicians they make a coalition with this one this year the next elections they win they lose they make a coalition with that one that's how the world works the world he marries this one today he marries that one tomorrow he marries that one or today he loves this girl tomorrow that girl H don't do that my boys be sure of her when you go to her be sure don't break this one's heart tomorrow I don't know why I'm saying this but I I'm not I'm not really preaching about marriage I'm just coaching the young ones that are not yet married especially the boys don't go to this one tomorrow that one tomorrow that you you're breaking God's people's hearts you're breaking taking God's heart don't do that you hear me young man can the young man say hallelujah amen so and you girls don't just agree and follow okay my girls I'm very soft with girls I I want to say I'm very soft the person okay um maybe should start picking up on my wife now I'm picking up too much on on my sister came some off yeah good sorry let's just jump to the next slide and then we will finish what am I saying here um when people flatters you you know what is to flatter you flatter you uh uh raish you're the main man there's no no one like you in church who can play that bass guitar no one and we flatter you we praise you beyond H that's an opportunity to check to desend us that ah okay thank you brother and you're checking me so flattery is another opportunity take the praise acknowledge it you must say thank you you but must it's not much about a man it's about the gift of God in that man wow my brother God has blessed you I thank God for this gift of yours that is why your gift is not necessarily your gift only your gift is ours is for the edification of the church and if we approach our gifts like that that our gift we respect God's Gift in me that he make me a custodian and a steward to benefit his people then you have not missed your opportunity Hallelujah brother bam in the message experiences are you still comfortable with me don't report me to the pastor that I called your names too much today I'm sorry it was not my uh does not deliberate he says brother bam and I wrote a little title I said don't fail to take your opportunity don't fail grab the opportunity and grab it by faith the fact that you are alive you are here you are healthy is a great opportunity that you found yourself in and God called you so you have walked up to so far here don't stop now continue taking God's promises and opportunities as they come to you by faith am amen he says and he said now it's like it was a funeral or somebody passed away or something happened they're saying and he said they said brother Brenham she's the only one in the bunch that's a Christian and he said I guess that we we just too mean those people are say no no we are just too mean we are not much of a Christian like that person that's the reason that God's asking is taking her from us because we are not Christians this are Christians talking like that that the devil wants you to be mean unto yourself that the things that are happening what is this he want you he he's a guy who's very self-destructive and he wants us to be self-destructive what did Brother Bram say and I seen then the opportunity that God had give given me see he saw an opportunity I see two there I don't know how many you see the first opportunity that I see is for me to show those people that no it's not like that that's the enemy making you talk like that the second one was the opportunity for them to know that the reason why God does things in our lives is for his honor and glory is doesn't it say so in the Book of Ecclesiastes that the whole matter the conclusion of the whole matter matter of Life the philosophy of life is that God can be praised in my life that's the whole reason why I exist the whole reason why there's doctors and everything sorry let's just focus can s it up amen the whole matter is that God can get Glory and Honor that's the whole matter this is an opportunity now right now this is an opportunity we can see that the enemy is not happy I'm sorry about that right that was a little challenging opportunity but hey you may not see why is an opportunity I may not see but I know that anything that happens to a son and a daughter of God in our lives is an opportunity it must bring glory and honor to God some way or the other amen now here brother Bram is talking about they said he's talking I'm going back to the story of those four lepos leprosis who were at the gate they said why don't we s sit here till we die we can go into the city there's nothing to eat there they were talking about the city where they come from there's nothing all people are dead there they were starving they were eating one another's children and if if they you know the story those lios who were out of the city in the city there's hunger people are dead outside but there's an army outside of the enemy that is camping there with a big Camp there's food and there's everything these guys are discussing now the story I was telling you at the beginning they only had one opportunity that was go down to the enemy's Camp don't be afraid to challenge the enemy and take what belongs to you you know there's things in our life along this journey as we we lose certain things and and we are serving a god of opportunities that can even be restored you know God's opportunities are endless God is one examiner who are the students here God is one examiner that I've seen that he he he will not change the question paper he will bring the same question paper sister Tiana until you pass it today I'm glad I never called her he will bring the same question paper until you pass it same one he doesn't trick like a a trick examiner and change and say no your mess today this this no same one my boy he'll bring it until you pass it he will present you with that opportunity to know what is going to happen tomorrow once you pass it then you move on another one come God has got endless opportunities sorry James I'm I'm I don't know what's happening here and they went down down there and God upon the Merit of that kind of faithed them see can you see that you use faith when you take opportunities so don't just take a chance believe and take that opportunity but nothing happens to you a son and a daughter of God I just want to reemphasize this as I'm closing nothing happens to you by by chance of mistake or by anything everything to you that that happens to you now and even before you serve God was in the plan of God was a purpose all meant for your benefit so count it all joy Rich poor anything because you you are a princess you're not just an ordinary Prince you are the prince from the Royal of the royal Mar from inside you are the the enemy must never put you on a corner and you you no no no no no no you and you don't even have to say he knows it you are the prin just devil remember my bloodline he knows you have kicked him with a blow he won't come back on that one again okay you hear me more so let's just go into prayer and uh I always like to read this scripture second Timothy chapter 3 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly finished unto all good works did you hear that sister let's just stand on our feet and then we're going to pray um I know that uh there was a few prayer request that were given
