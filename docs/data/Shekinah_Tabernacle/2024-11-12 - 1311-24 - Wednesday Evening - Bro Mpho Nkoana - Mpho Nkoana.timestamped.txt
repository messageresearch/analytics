[23:45] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[23:47] amen we may enjoy the comfort of our our
[23:51] seats and then we will read
[23:54] Romans remember last time we also read
[23:56] Romans so at it seems brother Ben that
[23:59] as long as I'm going to find myself here
[24:02] I'm going to be reading
[24:04] Romans um Romans chapter 8 so I it's
[24:08] just does not want to leave me brother
[24:10] Colin Romans chapter 8 let's read Romans
[24:13] chapter 8 but uh that's why I want to to
[24:17] sort of take our thought tonight that we
[24:20] will talk about H verse 11 8811 it says
[24:23] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[24:27] Jesus from the dead dwell in
[24:31] you he that raised up Christ from the
[24:34] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[24:38] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[24:41] you so when the spirit of the Lord the
[24:45] same one that Rose him from the dead
[24:48] dwells in you tonight it will also
[24:52] Quicken your mortal body so it is this
[24:56] quickening it is this quickening that I
[24:58] want us to speak about this evening amen
[25:02] and if it's okay with you this evening I
[25:04] want us to talk about just a simple but
[25:07] most powerful thought about this the
[25:11] magnet
[25:15] amen sister I hope that I have emailed
[25:18] you the right document
[25:22] e if you see someone scratching their
[25:24] head but we are talking about the magnet
[25:27] the Great
[25:29] magnet H the version that I had said
[25:32] said
[25:34] uh the the the great moving magnet
[25:37] sister tella I'm I'm hoping I didn't
[25:39] send you the right one but if I sent you
[25:41] that wrong one that's what the Lord
[25:45] wanted so we are talking I want us to
[25:47] speak a little bit about this
[25:51] magnet how many of you know is a magnet
[25:54] you know a magnet eh and as boys we used
[25:57] to play with magnet magnet is something
[26:00] that is very interesting and it's very
[26:02] strange thing because it has got some
[26:05] power it has got some force a magnet has
[26:08] got a force that you can't you you can't
[26:11] you can't see you can't touch you cannot
[26:13] but you can you can see the effect of
[26:16] the of the magnet amen you know have you
[26:19] ever hold a maget held a magnet do you
[26:22] know a
[26:23] magnet so a magnet this great big magnet
[26:28] that I've tried to I used hey technology
[26:32] I used this this thing called AI to
[26:35] create that
[26:36] picture and then h i told it what what
[26:40] to give and then it gave me this picture
[26:43] this is not an original picture from
[26:46] some Factory so AI gave me that and
[26:51] then when the prophet preaches talks
[26:54] about this magnet he says that magnet is
[26:57] Jesus that great big magnet is there and
[27:01] is
[27:02] moving huh and it's moving it's moving
[27:06] so when it moves there's something that
[27:09] happens when that magnet moves that
[27:12] magnet it got because it just got a
[27:15] power so with with a magnet just to
[27:18] simplify it for you a magnet has got a
[27:23] has got a um they say it just got two
[27:27] poles Two Poles the North and the
[27:30] South so my in my mind the Lord put in
[27:34] my heart to think about you know if you
[27:37] can just think of the male and the
[27:39] female huh you'll follow me as we go
[27:42] along because the reason is this you see
[27:45] a magnet if you take two magnets and
[27:47] then this is the North Pole and the
[27:49] North Pole of this side of the magnet
[27:51] and you bring them together they cannot
[27:53] they cannot attract one another they
[27:54] they actually repel each other they
[27:57] can't they can't catch each
[27:59] other because they they of the same
[28:03] opposite forces in other words they they
[28:05] fighting they're not they're not they're
[28:07] not magnetized to each other the poles
[28:09] so it must be the North and the South
[28:13] and then they they'll they they'll catch
[28:15] even before you get the they'll attract
[28:17] one another so so so I it came to me
[28:21] that to think about a male and a female
[28:23] because we to be honest with you we are
[28:26] the female part of God am we are the
[28:29] female part of Jesus right that is why
[28:32] that is why and I know that there's
[28:34] people on video land we pray that the
[28:36] Lord will also bless them H if I invited
[28:39] a friend of mine to check to to to to to
[28:43] worship with us I don't know if he's
[28:44] online but you see that is why you can't
[28:47] find a male lion and a male lion
[28:50] together that is why it's not according
[28:52] to the word of God for a male man and a
[28:55] male man to to to come together or a
[28:58] female and a female no no they can't
[29:00] they are not magnetized to be together
[29:03] there there shouldn't be any magnet any
[29:05] magnet that you can be told any Force
[29:08] any form of whatever love is not from
[29:12] God this was not part of what I wanted
[29:14] to talk
[29:17] about but but the magnet attracts the
[29:21] opposite side the the north attracts the
[29:23] the South and the South attracts the
[29:25] north then they they cat one another it
[29:28] will be hard to separate them because
[29:32] now what does a magnet do when you bring
[29:34] it to when you bring a magnet I wanted
[29:37] to buy a magnet but but this thing is a
[29:41] magnet see this wonderful phone of mine
[29:44] it's got a magnet when I get into my car
[29:47] there's another
[29:49] magnet and when I when I put it there
[29:51] before I even put it it pulls my hand
[29:54] the other magnet it's
[29:57] called it clicks can you see it can't
[29:59] stick to my hand now because my hand is
[30:02] not magnetized to this there is no so a
[30:05] magnet what it does according to is it
[30:07] physics or is chemistry it
[30:10] infuses a force in an object so the
[30:14] force of that magnet is infused into an
[30:17] object until it changes what we call the
[30:20] magnetic fields of that object and they
[30:23] become North and South if it's if if
[30:25] it's if it's north and south that one
[30:27] that object object becomes south and
[30:29] north then it it catches it to a point
[30:32] that that object if it can be so infused
[30:35] with that power of that magnet it can
[30:37] even catch another
[30:40] object can you see what your life can do
[30:43] if you are so much infused with the
[30:44] presence of God if you are so much
[30:47] magnetized you can even magnetize other
[30:49] people to
[30:51] Jesus are we together now let's just get
[30:55] to our seon I haven't got there brother
[30:57] B
[31:00] so I I wrote here that a magnet produces
[31:03] magnetic fields so in order for a magnet
[31:07] to is got that force that that that
[31:10] field that is in a magnet that's where
[31:12] the power lies the power of a magnet so
[31:15] that another object or another magnet
[31:17] can be able to be attracted right and
[31:22] that pulls an object like iron Cobalt
[31:25] towards
[31:26] it all have okay I've already spoken
[31:29] about that we can just move on so I told
[31:32] you about that I've just introduced that
[31:34] without looking there because if you
[31:35] look at that picture you will see that
[31:38] some of the objects are not moving
[31:42] yet and some of them are already on air
[31:45] can you see them they they being pulled
[31:48] by some
[31:49] force and some of them as the magnet
[31:52] moves if the owner of the FM comes and
[31:54] just spread Spread spread it spread it
[31:57] spread the word spread the word correct
[32:01] encourage motivate uplift break the
[32:04] chains spread that pile there cuz some
[32:07] are underneath there and they've got
[32:10] they've got the the atoms it's so
[32:11] interesting if you read about the magnet
[32:13] because they say the the the electrons
[32:15] in the
[32:16] magnet H has got atoms that moves into
[32:20] one direction am I right that moves into
[32:23] One Direction any other thing that
[32:25] cannot be attracted by a magnet the
[32:27] atoms in that object
[32:28] they go have Hazard they go in the wrong
[32:31] different dire that's why the magnet but
[32:33] in the magnet all electrons in each and
[32:37] every atom they move into the same
[32:39] direction so the magnet goes into the
[32:42] magnet put that that INF infusion into
[32:45] an object induces it and it has atoms
[32:48] that goes like that that's why the
[32:49] magnet catches it so some of those
[32:53] objects up they have got the qualities
[32:56] and the ingredients and and and they
[32:58] have been predestinated for the market
[33:01] for the magnet to catch them but they
[33:04] underneath some of them have got did you
[33:06] hear the pastor last
[33:09] weekend I said to him look can I just go
[33:12] there and repeat
[33:14] youron he said yes so I won't repeat it
[33:18] but I'll just say said as said detour
[33:21] like brother Greg said I'll just take a
[33:23] small detour what the pastor said on
[33:25] Sunday one of the things was
[33:28] that what you the comments that you make
[33:31] about your brother and and and and and
[33:35] your attitude towards your brother that
[33:38] thing challenged me so much and the Lord
[33:40] said to me sitting there it the Lord
[33:42] said it doesn't end up
[33:45] there even when you are not talking to
[33:48] anyone when you just alone your
[33:51] thoughts because the prophet taught us
[33:54] that our thoughts not even our words our
[33:57] thoughts speak louder he said tell them
[34:00] tell them that their thoughts speaks
[34:03] louder in heaven than their weights just
[34:05] our thought the moment I sit here and I
[34:08] think about my brother
[34:10] negatively imagine it just making noise
[34:14] and it is upsetting the Lord because the
[34:17] Lord has pre-worn me and you it's so
[34:20] important brothers and sisters it's so
[34:22] important because the battle that we are
[34:24] fighting the battle that we are fighting
[34:27] is so serious and the devil does not
[34:30] want me and you to realize the the the
[34:33] the how how ferocious how how how
[34:37] dangerous and how how evil this battle
[34:40] is he doesn't want people whether
[34:43] believer and it doesn't want no one to
[34:45] realize that this is a serious battle
[34:47] and we want to take it seriously and act
[34:51] according to those principles and
[34:53] tactics of War which is the word of God
[34:57] that is why so important to be
[34:59] magnetized by the word to be pulled so
[35:02] tonight um we just going to talk about
[35:05] because the
[35:06] Rapture as we see here is is taking
[35:10] place the Rapture is not going to just
[35:13] the the day we change our bodies it's
[35:15] just the culmination it's just the it's
[35:18] just the what do we call a novel a novel
[35:21] when you read a book and we say when the
[35:22] story is at the peak what do we call
[35:24] it climax climax
[35:28] the changing of the body is just going
[35:30] to be the climax it's just going to be
[35:33] the the climax and TOS the end of the
[35:35] story we are gone right now my girls the
[35:38] Rapture is taking place right now there
[35:42] must be until brother Isaiah Brooks
[35:43] wrote a book a song is it him who wrote
[35:46] it I the great magnet pulling me I what
[35:52] does it say I know for sure it must be
[35:56] God because I feel the
[35:59] pool huh you feel the pool tonight the
[36:02] problem is that some of those
[36:06] things I must I better go to myON sister
[36:10] vessa some of those things H have been
[36:14] there for a very long time seasons and
[36:17] rains and elements have set on them they
[36:20] are still iring or still they can still
[36:22] be they are still or they've got
[36:25] magnetic fields in them amen but but
[36:28] because there's so much time and you
[36:31] know they are rusted they've got things
[36:34] around them they've got so much some of
[36:37] them actually they're bolded down
[36:40] they're tight tight a magnet tries to
[36:43] pull them no they're
[36:46] baled the owner of the family could come
[36:49] and cut those
[36:51] balls cut some of them there they're
[36:54] trying to to cat the magnet
[36:58] they can't because they
[37:00] aluminium you know
[37:04] aluminium it just go like this the
[37:06] magnet goes
[37:08] goes so you want to catch the magnet
[37:11] when it passes your way you want to open
[37:14] your heart and your ears because you see
[37:16] yeah particularly you young people
[37:18] because there's so
[37:20] much so much that the devil is throwing
[37:24] to Earth
[37:28] even the Elder even the Elder the
[37:30] parents but the young people this is
[37:32] this is my my my thing about the young
[37:34] people the devil is
[37:36] aware that if the Lord carries you are
[37:40] going to be powerful sords powerful
[37:43] destroyers of giants one thing he knows
[37:48] and he knows that you are in the right
[37:51] environment and he can see the light
[37:54] your parents dedicated you they're
[37:56] praying for you you got baptized he can
[37:58] see the chances of this guy changing is
[38:01] is threatening me and he also knows that
[38:04] he don't have
[38:06] experience he knows all those things so
[38:09] he makes sure that he start them from
[38:12] primary school from kindergarten he
[38:14] starts
[38:15] them
[38:17] from it's so pathetic it's so dangerous
[38:21] if you can dig and see what the devil
[38:23] does to the young people from small they
[38:26] want to watch horror movies movies from
[38:29] small small it it just he magneti that
[38:32] remember the devil also got his own
[38:34] magnet he's got his own magnet too so
[38:36] the enemy works so hard so it means us
[38:40] we shouldn't just take for granted and
[38:43] say we are we are believers we are the
[38:45] bride and the Lord has done a finished
[38:46] job of course he did but our daily life
[38:50] should remove all the
[38:52] rest even if I'm not sure that this
[38:55] thing is a demon I don't want to get
[38:57] closer to it even anything any even the
[39:00] appearance of
[39:02] sin the appearance the very
[39:05] appearance when you see a woman
[39:09] naked and the Lord the angel of God
[39:11] respects that the they Applause
[39:15] you you see no no a naked woman pass I
[39:19] know there's plenty of them but the Lord
[39:22] looks here what is your
[39:24] attitude what is your attitude do you
[39:27] commment and entertain that thought I
[39:30] bet that is the rust that's the r that
[39:32] the Lord is trying to shave off from you
[39:34] to magnetize you but you are piling more
[39:38] you're not but I'm just saying don't
[39:40] allow
[39:41] it are we together the the the the the
[39:44] things that the pastor was telling us
[39:46] over the weekend I I can't wait for that
[39:48] series to continue and continue because
[39:51] the the word of God brothers and sisters
[39:53] it seeks to clean us the word of God
[39:56] knows what is Among Us it knows that you
[40:00] may say no no me me me I don't gossip I
[40:03] don't harb any grudges are you
[40:07] sure are you sure that when the minister
[40:11] is preaching here talking about attitude
[40:13] that yours so if you are sure then it's
[40:17] your job now to go and cry before God
[40:19] for that person that the word is talking
[40:22] about that's what I got from that
[40:24] message on Sunday and that's what I
[40:26] found the word challenging me so much
[40:28] that we ought to be on our knees on a
[40:31] daily
[40:32] basis otherwise what what are we busy
[40:35] with because we are objects that are
[40:36] meant to be busy worshiping
[40:39] something if God is an object of worship
[40:42] then we are objects of
[40:44] worshiping what are you worshiping what
[40:47] is magnetizing us on a daily basis
[40:50] children let's make sure that we are
[40:54] magnetized by the great magnet amen I'll
[40:58] read for you a few quotes then we are
[41:00] done it's just three slides
[41:04] four not twoo much
[41:06] brother
[41:09] so where where was
[41:12] I so when this magnet keeps moving keeps
[41:16] moving keeps moving it attracts it
[41:19] attracts everything that can be
[41:21] magnetized it goes with the magnet you
[41:23] know why he taking them to it's taking
[41:25] them to be molded to we molded in a big
[41:28] pot and you know go back to the original
[41:31] state that's where we are going it
[41:35] taking them to be moled in a pot to be
[41:37] just like to be
[41:39] one to be like
[41:51] him let me read for you here from that
[41:55] seron and may the the Lord Jesus reveal
[41:58] himself himself to each one of you here
[42:01] tonight in such a way that you will set
[42:05] your affections towards Jesus Christ and
[42:08] never change your
[42:11] cause but go straight towards him all
[42:16] the
[42:18] time you are in this life's journey all
[42:21] you all the time you are in this life's
[42:23] journey all the time meaning that a a a
[42:29] you know you know this thing called the
[42:31] greatest mind the greatest battle ever
[42:33] fought I always wanted to speak about it
[42:36] but I I just never get to it's so it's
[42:39] so big it's so complicated it's so it's
[42:42] so so so so big this greatest battle
[42:45] that is happening in our minds that
[42:48] sometimes you'll find
[42:50] that if you are not magnetized if you're
[42:53] not making sure that you are magnetized
[42:57] huh you'll find that you you're actually
[42:59] fighting against
[43:01] yourself you helping the devil to
[43:04] destroy you let alone leave your brother
[43:07] alone yourself he's capable to create
[43:10] thoughts in your mind the thoughts that
[43:14] are seeking to destroy you and you are
[43:16] not aware brother Ben mentioned it one
[43:18] time that that you think these are my
[43:20] thoughts and they are not your
[43:23] thoughts to an extent that I said to my
[43:25] children hey let me tell you something a
[43:27] tip let me give I was giving one of my
[43:28] boys a tip I said hey we were just
[43:31] chatting I was not correcting him or
[43:32] anything so they are good
[43:34] boys he was say I said hey you must be
[43:38] oh yes it was kir he was telling me a
[43:41] testimony he was telling me a testimony
[43:44] about he was sitting in the train and
[43:46] then H the Holy Spirit something said to
[43:49] him hey talk to that guy and tell him
[43:53] that he must he must get ready to get
[43:56] off the train if he's getting off the
[43:58] next station cuz this guy is busy with
[44:00] the fold man something told him and he
[44:03] just said ah he's a big boy he knows
[44:07] everything so and then the train stops
[44:10] the next stop people get off the train
[44:13] closes the doors and it goes as soon as
[44:15] the train start to move he jumps hey I
[44:18] missed my train huh but the Son of God
[44:21] was there and the spirit said to him
[44:23] tell that guy warn him can I was trying
[44:25] to show him that hey actually as
[44:27] Christians we need to be able to learn
[44:30] how to listen to the spirit to be
[44:32] sensitive to to know when our Lord talks
[44:35] and when the devil talks that's your
[44:37] duty guys those are the things that if I
[44:39] were you I'll be learning to strive the
[44:42] and asking the Lord to help me to to
[44:44] know the shenanigans of the devil not to
[44:47] be busy on the phone playing games
[44:49] forever games are
[44:51] good but they've got their
[44:54] limitations phones are good but remember
[44:58] they are
[44:59] anointed phones are anointed everything
[45:02] that you see here the devil has got a
[45:05] hand in
[45:06] it why why are they so
[45:09] popular isn't it the Bible says the
[45:12] great is the
[45:13] road of the lost and narrow is the
[45:19] one so young people have got a strong
[45:22] strong strong feeling and passion about
[45:24] you guys because the devil knows those
[45:26] four things that you are not
[45:28] experienced that and he even and breathe
[45:32] a spirit of disrespect and disobedient
[45:34] and just just to each country to each
[45:36] family to each community that no until
[45:39] the government even said no you don't
[45:40] hit the
[45:42] children and then he just makes other
[45:45] demons to go and make a few fathers who
[45:47] are abusive and parents so that the
[45:50] another demon can say you see we must
[45:52] protect the children because of this
[45:54] meanwhile it's both two demons
[45:57] you see it's the same devil it's very
[45:59] tickery
[46:01] so our children should be corrected by
[46:05] the weight
[46:07] amen but it starts with us the
[46:11] parents our knees must be painful they
[46:14] must be worn
[46:16] out our knees must be worn out for our
[46:18] children because you have got the the
[46:22] experience you've got the
[46:25] responsibility you've got a God is going
[46:27] to be asking you there's somewhere in
[46:30] the Bible that says I'm going to punish
[46:32] the children because of the iniquity of
[46:33] the parents you know that
[46:36] one how will a loving father and mother
[46:38] want their child to go to hell or to be
[46:41] punished by God because of them so it
[46:43] means our
[46:45] knes must be worn out and
[46:48] painful praying and
[46:51] crying bringing that atmosphere all the
[46:53] time at
[46:55] home in our life
[46:57] calling them by name every
[47:00] day so that God can magnetize them you
[47:05] children your job is that Lord I went
[47:09] through the water I Believe In You Lord
[47:12] give me that experience I want it Lord
[47:15] so first priority for a young person
[47:19] when you wake up Lord guide me Lead Me
[47:23] Lord as I know my father and my mom are
[47:26] praying for me but Lord this feeling
[47:28] this one this one this influence he he's
[47:30] got so much influence that he's he's
[47:32] pouring to the world to the young
[47:36] people so I don't know why I'm talking
[47:39] about that but I didn't
[47:42] plan so all the time we need to focus on
[47:46] him all our
[47:49] lives let's read the next
[47:52] one then we'll read the last one three
[47:56] what do three
[47:57] stands for what does it signifies by the
[47:59] way
[48:02] P
[48:04] Perfection number three
[48:06] Perfection completion going to complete
[48:10] now next next slide quote number
[48:14] two I've seen now he's narrating what I
[48:17] was trying to tell you about that
[48:19] picture the prophet is's narrating this
[48:21] picture he says I've seen a track coming
[48:25] down through there and uh when it did is
[48:29] is is talking about this this big crane
[48:32] this big magnet on the T and here it
[48:34] come and the great magnet coming down a
[48:38] great magnet and and and and and through
[48:41] there
[48:42] and as the magnet passed down through
[48:45] the line I began to notice those
[48:48] shavings flying up to meet it like
[48:53] that them metal shavings I noticed some
[48:56] of them didn't come up and I noticed
[48:59] several pieces of iron didn't come up
[49:02] and that magnet went on back over into
[49:06] the co Cula and and and and and M M drop
[49:10] dropped all of this stuff down into the
[49:13] capula Kola and it was melted and made
[49:17] over again and I said well why didn't it
[49:20] all rise up I said I see some shavings
[49:24] and that man owner of the factory the
[49:26] prophet was talking about and then he
[49:28] said Rend
[49:29] Brum we make some aluminium PS here he
[49:33] said and those aluminium pieces are not
[49:35] magnetized in that magnet they are not
[49:39] magnetized so we are not aluminum we are
[49:42] still that get that that is magnetized
[49:45] that is supposed to be caught by the
[49:47] magnet and if my my challenge not the
[49:50] challenge but this is my message that I
[49:53] must seek to be magnetized and if I
[49:55] don't feel the affection if I don't feel
[49:58] the attraction the pool I must start to
[50:01] to raise my
[50:02] ears you know if you go in the bush and
[50:05] you just watch carefully you'll see the
[50:08] Impala grazing grazing
[50:10] grazing or a rabbit all of a sudden it
[50:13] just stops and the ears go like
[50:19] this
[50:20] Grace because it's sensing it's sensing
[50:25] that there must be danger somewhere yeah
[50:27] and it's even
[50:29] smelling so we must be able to be so
[50:33] sensitive J isn't it to to to check that
[50:37] hey Lord no no no no no no no no I know
[50:39] I'm a Son of God but I want to be sure
[50:42] why why this problem why do I have this
[50:45] problem why am I experiencing this this
[50:47] this this this no no no is this the way
[50:49] Lord Daddy come let's talk advise me
[50:51] here the danger the this is the danger
[50:54] you young people must must be open
[50:57] enough to find someone
[51:00] here that you've got confidence to talk
[51:02] to don't don't the devil wants people
[51:05] who are in the corner in the
[51:08] darkness that is why even when people
[51:11] get married where are they where my my
[51:13] lovely couple when they get
[51:15] married the Bible says they must not do
[51:17] that
[51:19] unadvised so you must never be feel shy
[51:23] to say to a sister sister come talk to
[51:26] me when you are my age of course someone
[51:28] that you trust you pray about your mom
[51:30] your dad your aunt your sister you've
[51:32] got the pastor's wife their girls talk
[51:35] don't die alone don't struggle alone HH
[51:41] don't allow and do it early do it
[51:43] quicker don't overthink it call Daddy
[51:47] Daddy tell me cuz nowadays we talk
[51:50] things with our children we talk we talk
[51:53] boys must talk to their father heavy
[51:55] stuff and you fathers
[51:57] easy easy easy allow the boys to
[52:00] talk to talk what they think and don't
[52:03] be
[52:04] judgmental but this was not in
[52:08] myON so we must not be judgmental
[52:12] sorry we must allow the boys to talk to
[52:14] a point where they think that now
[52:16] they're free to express themselves and
[52:20] they can open up and they can tell and
[52:22] you can be able to advise and motivate
[52:25] them and encourage them and even tell
[52:27] them that when I was your age me I
[52:29] failed on that
[52:30] one they you dead one time I told my
[52:34] boys they said ah
[52:36] you they were surprised they said you I
[52:40] said yes me so they need to know that
[52:44] even dad went through this and he
[52:45] doesn't want me to go through this
[52:47] thing they must know you that you are
[52:49] this my father no no my father no no no
[52:52] no no no he can preach he
[52:55] can't he can't

[53:14] here where the Prophet said and those
[53:17] pieces are not magnetized to that
[53:20] magnet are we
[53:23] magnetized on a daily basis because the
[53:26] great magnet is busy moving he's busy
[53:29] moving there's going to come a time when
[53:31] he's fully released and he come fully in
[53:34] his physical body to come and take us
[53:37] home when that when that Force
[53:41] come you should have already been
[53:43] started to catch and that catch Starts
[53:45] Now it starts now
[53:47] today don't postpone it allow the devil
[53:52] to be a loser in your
[53:54] life just allow the devil don't support
[53:57] him to be a winner if he's a winner not
[54:00] through you tell him not through me not
[54:03] today brother Isaac isn't it not me not
[54:05] today not now me I want Jesus to win I I
[54:09] may be a failure I may fail but devil I
[54:12] make it very
[54:13] clear I said to my friend hey man I told
[54:17] you about our our church we moved now we
[54:20] moved from Stokes Val we are now in
[54:22] lowart he lives in Newlands he a young
[54:24] man who you know you know how young
[54:26] people are and I said to him I because
[54:29] previously I told him about shakina to
[54:31] stream so he never did busy with
[54:34] football so somehow tonight I said hey

[54:43] oh he laughed when I tell him I say I'm
[54:45] preaching he laughed I didn't ask him
[54:47] why he's
[54:49] laughing I didn't ask him I think he
[54:52] couldn't just imagine me brother KU
[54:54] preaching and I said yeah so I thought
[54:56] that was something I thought that is
[54:57] something that would catch him to come
[54:59] and listen and hear that I'm talking
[55:01] about young
[55:03] people so may God bless my dear H
[55:06] colleague there uh let's move to the
[55:08] next slide and then we we will be
[55:11] finishing but the main thing here is
[55:14] that uh just to finish off that if he
[55:17] said if you noted this man tell him
[55:19] brother if you noted they are bolted
[55:21] down some of those things are bolted we
[55:23] don't want to be bolted down we not
[55:26] disputing that there are bolted things
[55:29] that Bol the devil wants to bolt in our
[55:31] life and even weld them no no there a
[55:33] holy ghost
[55:35] grinder that can grind them and cut them
[55:39] and it's very sharp it can cut them
[55:42] allow the grinder of the Holy Spirit
[55:45] just allow just allow just be open just
[55:47] be open have you ever seen a a a cat you
[55:52] know being or or or a dog just or being
[55:55] nicely stroked just allow yourself to be
[55:57] pruned by the Lord just be pruned just
[56:01] say
[56:03] Lord when my wife cut my hair I just
[56:06] like she just turn my head the way she
[56:07] wants I don't stiffen my head and say
[56:10] don't turn me that way hey honey I
[56:13] turn then she makes it that way and then
[56:16] the machine pinches me oh sorry then she
[56:19] goes she's Pro you see that's how we
[56:21] need to allow the Lord to do in our
[56:25] lives that's right not say no don't cut
[56:28] you no no no no the Lord knows better
[56:30] how to cut your hair how to prepare you
[56:35] to be magnetized I want you to be
[56:38] magnetized because
[56:40] tomorrow tomorrow boys I'm expecting
[56:42] very very very strongly brother Arman
[56:44] said to me he's under great expectation
[56:46] tonight I am under expectation that if
[56:48] the Lord terries which I don't want him
[56:50] to T if he tiries I want to sit there
[56:54] and listen to AB preaching to me am and
[56:57] listen to jono and listen to Mo and
[56:59] Reuben blessing and delivering souls and
[57:03] how they're not just going to wake up
[57:05] one morning and they do that no the time
[57:08] to do that is to start now to lay that
[57:11] Foundation to prepared I want K to be
[57:14] standing here
[57:16] breaking those
[57:18] Devils right that's what we're expecting
[57:21] and not only preaching but being
[57:24] victorious in their individual Liv
[57:27] lives ah to a point where a young man
[57:30] who is not so clear who wants to bring a
[57:33] wrong inspiration until he knows that ah
[57:35] that group if you go with them you can't
[57:38] do those guys I don't want to walk with
[57:39] them because they'll tell you about
[57:42] Jesus amen yeah I don't want to walk but
[57:47] if an unbeliever gets attracted to you
[57:49] and don't want to go there's only two
[57:52] options only two I don't I don't like to
[57:55] do this there's only two
[57:57] two options it's either they are
[58:00] attracted by your life and they inspired
[58:03] and they like something is pulling them
[58:05] something is magnetizing them to come to
[58:07] Jesus or you are actually being
[58:11] magnetized to them so I taught this one
[58:15] sorry not this one my
[58:16] daughter I taught her from small I said
[58:20] never never never never in your life
[58:22] never and she was small she said I said
[58:25] never
[58:27] allow yourself to follow your
[58:30] friends they must follow
[58:34] you you've got a choice I'm telling you
[58:36] now if they if I find you following
[58:43] them so I was planting his seat until
[58:47] one day she was she took it so strong
[58:51] I'm not preaching about my family sorry
[58:53] she took it so strong that she
[58:57] now and she reminded me no no but it was
[58:59] your fault you said they must follow me
[59:03] so I'm trying to practice what you
[59:05] preached me what you taught me they must
[59:06] follow me I must not follow them I said
[59:08] no but that's too strong now my girl
[59:10] don't be too too
[59:12] hard so our young people you need to
[59:15] know that friends must follow Jesus in
[59:19] you you mustn't follow them you must
[59:24] Inspire them you must love them to a
[59:26] point where they follow you and don't
[59:29] allow the world to magnetize you don't
[59:32] allow things around your life don't
[59:34] allow your job your work H your business
[59:38] your thoughts your things H your
[59:41] passions to be the ones that disturbs
[59:43] you be magnetized until we Elders we
[59:46] just make it a
[59:47] church it's not acceptable isn't it that
[59:51] now we we just a church no no no no
[59:54] right now we are supposed to be
[59:55] magnetized magnetize magnetize until we
[59:58] are fully infused that when the Great
[1:00:01] Lord of Heaven comes physically finally
[1:00:03] down just we just go within a within a
[1:00:07] twinkling of an eye we are going to go
[1:00:10] twinkling of an eye will be gone and we
[1:00:12] want our children with
[1:00:15] us last slide and I'm I'm thinking of a
[1:00:20] great magnet sitting Yonder in the
[1:00:22] heavens at the right hand of God
[1:00:24] Almighty and someday God's going to let
[1:00:27] him come and all those who are
[1:00:31] magnetized to Holy to his spirit will go
[1:00:35] up in the
[1:00:38] air it's not going to be that my family
[1:00:41] believes the message that we've got a
[1:00:45] history of the message my family or me I
[1:00:49] got I I got baptized on the 9th of May
[1:00:52] 1991 I've been long in the message it's
[1:00:55] not going to be that kind of a talk God
[1:00:57] doesn't listen to that those things he
[1:00:59] that time he's not going to be the
[1:01:01] Savior kind who's talking to you now you
[1:01:04] see right now I'm talking kindly maybe
[1:01:07] I'm rough I don't know but I'm talking
[1:01:09] kind that time and I'm not threatening
[1:01:11] you it's not going to be a
[1:01:13] game of h h no no no because he must
[1:01:16] stick to his word his eyes will be bo
[1:01:19] boiling like fire that time he'll be the
[1:01:21] world people will be wanting to die and
[1:01:24] they can't die
[1:01:26] gun will just go through your head not
[1:01:28] you those who are left
[1:01:30] behind and death will be no more so we
[1:01:34] are not that we are want to get
[1:01:36] magnetized young people you need to know
[1:01:38] this but you you when you come with all
[1:01:42] your heart and everything you're not
[1:01:43] going to come because you are afraid
[1:01:46] yeah death is going to disappear and no
[1:01:48] no you're going to say ah Lord you've
[1:01:50] allowed me to be part of this great
[1:01:52] homegoing to avoid all those things
[1:01:55] thank you I love you so
[1:01:58] much you're not coming because you're
[1:02:00] fearful of not going into the Rapture
[1:02:03] you are coming because you are so
[1:02:05] thankful you are so sold out to him for
[1:02:07] him to avoid your life going through
[1:02:09] those things that he could die to give
[1:02:13] you access not to go through those
[1:02:15] things this is a big opportunity is the
[1:02:18] greatest
[1:02:19] opportunity to all of us I'm telling you
[1:02:23] now in closing
[1:02:27] that magnet is going to be released one
[1:02:29] of these
[1:02:30] days are you getting
[1:02:34] magnetized because to be magnetized is
[1:02:37] to be attracted to his word daily to be
[1:02:41] attracted is to be sold out to find in
[1:02:44] your self that I'm not feeling okay
[1:02:48] today why oh I didn't read my
[1:02:50] Bible I'm not feeling well I'm not
[1:02:54] something is not right how many times
[1:02:56] did I pray today those things should be
[1:02:58] part of your life as a Christian did you
[1:03:01] know that I saw a newspaper clip before
[1:03:06] an article a young Jewish Jewish not
[1:03:09] Jewish Arab young little Arab boy the
[1:03:11] age maybe of dman or Danny or
[1:03:16] Daniel there was war between uh I think
[1:03:19] it was 2001 Iraq war or no no sorry it
[1:03:23] was between the Arabs and the
[1:03:24] Jewish so this boy was picking up a rock
[1:03:27] man a small boy a rock and the
[1:03:30] journalist happened to take a picture he
[1:03:32] was taking that rock he wanted to to to
[1:03:35] Big he wanted to throw it to the to the
[1:03:38] Israeli
[1:03:39] soldiers can you see because that boy
[1:03:42] he's fully
[1:03:44] indoctrinated he's fully induced with
[1:03:46] what they tell him from small from birth
[1:03:49] the spirit goes and he grow up knowing
[1:03:52] that I must eliminate an Israel a Jew
[1:03:55] that's what all the demons are out to do
[1:03:58] they out to do to eliminate you and you
[1:04:02] must know that you your job is to go out
[1:04:05] and eliminate
[1:04:07] them where in my life where in my don't
[1:04:10] see your brother doing something wrong
[1:04:12] and you just condone
[1:04:14] it that's not love because the Bible
[1:04:18] says the word of God is for
[1:04:19] correction is for reprove is for
[1:04:23] encouragement encourage him
[1:04:26] you you are very lucky you've got a
[1:04:27] wonderful Pastor who instead of HE
[1:04:31] encourage you my brother that's not you
[1:04:33] see let take the
[1:04:36] opportunity because not all pastors are
[1:04:38] like that some pastors if you do hey the
[1:04:42] deacons out that boy
[1:04:45] out
[1:04:47] out I don't want that in this
[1:04:49] church so you're very blessed to have a
[1:04:52] pastor who can be your friend and then
[1:04:54] you do something like that he says
[1:04:57] brother that's the devil that's not you
[1:04:59] come that's a blessing man if I if I
[1:05:02] grew up like that I'm not saying my
[1:05:04] pastors were bad but I just sometimes
[1:05:06] wanted to reverse I want sometimes I
[1:05:09] want to reverse to be like them and have
[1:05:12] a and him he's my Elder and my pastor
[1:05:15] sometimes I want I want that is a great
[1:05:17] make him your
[1:05:21] friend and also make us the the fathers
[1:05:24] your friends
[1:05:27] but I mean it's just an important office
[1:05:29] that you can use it for your
[1:05:31] advantage young people you can do that
[1:05:35] amen get
[1:05:40] magnetized get attracted to him his
[1:05:43] glory his relationship with you let's
[1:05:45] get magnetized by the things let's not
[1:05:48] get magnetized by the things of the
[1:05:49] world we not saying you cannot use your
[1:05:52] phone you cannot do this you cannot do
[1:05:54] that but uh what percentage of your life
[1:05:58] those things takes in your life what
[1:05:59] percentage of your time just be honest
[1:06:02] and fair with yourself you know yourself
[1:06:04] just be in the little booth and talk to
[1:06:06] yourself what
[1:06:08] percentage of my life time in my life do
[1:06:12] I allocate to God just be honest you see
[1:06:16] the moment you are honest just you alone
[1:06:18] and the Lord just the two of you you the
[1:06:22] right the right thing comes out and the
[1:06:24] Lord sees that your sincer it your
[1:06:26] honesty and the Lord helps you just be
[1:06:29] honest with
[1:06:32] who with
[1:06:39] yourself this is the last
[1:06:42] slide and how glorious that is that we
[1:06:44] got a magnetic system in glory so this
[1:06:49] one when I highlighted that one I was
[1:06:51] thinking of my brothers the the tech
[1:06:53] desk
[1:06:55] can you see what it says it says we have
[1:06:57] got a glor and my eyes are failing me
[1:07:02] and how glorious that is that we got a
[1:07:05] magnetic system in glory our system our
[1:07:09] system we have we have and every man
[1:07:12] that has been made Compass to guide
[1:07:15] through this life will Point towards
[1:07:17] Jesus Christ that great system will not
[1:07:19] miss you you will be magnetized the
[1:07:22] electronics and the magnetic field of
[1:07:24] that system from Glory will magnetize
[1:07:27] you amen are you ready to be magnetized
[1:07:30] are you ready that every day you will
[1:07:33] seek to be magnetized to be attracted
[1:07:36] your affections until you dream talking
[1:07:39] to
[1:07:40] Jesus until you dream that you are in
[1:07:43] heaven when I was a little boy I I
[1:07:46] dreamed that oh we were in the
[1:07:48] Millennium and we were drinking tea and
[1:07:50] I told my mom that the tea was so good
[1:07:52] it had
[1:07:53] milk I told my mom and I grew up knowing
[1:07:56] that oh in the Millennium that's what
[1:07:59] I'm going to get because I I I I was so
[1:08:03] taught about the homec come the home
[1:08:05] that is
[1:08:07] coming and the devil along the way he
[1:08:09] steals those things he steals that
[1:08:12] inspiration as you get to the to the age
[1:08:15] of accountability he takes it he makes
[1:08:18] you forget and amize you and we don't
[1:08:22] want that to our children we want to
[1:08:23] preach the gospel so much so that they
