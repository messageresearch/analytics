that song came to me and i didn't prepare because it's normally a quiet choir song it's very nice sung in your choir but i couldn't even inconvenience my wife because it was just a short notice so so

commit all these needs lord you see the burdens on our hearts as well meet those as well may you ground it for your glory lord in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless your friends you may no you may not have your seats let's take our bibles you know zechariah 3 and 1. amen it's good to be home praise the lord good to be home thank you for your prayers and we had a good time at the camp and yeah praise the lord that's real good i mean so zechariah three and one we're gonna read down to verse five i don't have a slideshow um today now zechariah three and one now no no just just keep in the back of your mind that zechariah was a prophet to the jews when the temple was being restored to here's a restoration prophet so this is happening during a time of restoration so zechariah 3 and 1 and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuked thee o satan even the lord that has chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a bran plucked out of the fire now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and he said unto him and unto him he said sorry behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from me and i'll clothe thee with a change of raiment and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed them with garments and the angel of the lord stood by my lord amen may the lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning and i want to talk about uh so i preached this kind of in in fielding but i kind of changed a little bit so um but i want to preach about defeating the man with the three-edged club now brother brahm has this dream he says let me tell you of a god-given dream i had about triune baptism this was this was not a vision but a dream now this is taken from the church age book you know i am sure that one of the blessings of the church ages was to receive dreams by the holy ghost just the same as one can receive visions it was about 3 a.m on a saturday morning i just gotten up to get joseph a drink of water when i laid down i fell asleep instantly and dreamed this dream i saw a man that i suppose was my father he was a great big burly man i also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know if you take a log and you set it on the end and hit it with an axe it makes a three cornered witch-like piece of firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down as she would lay there crying he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his face with such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction in beating up this poor little woman every time she tried to get up he would hit her i did not like what he was doing but as i was considering stopping him i thought i can't tackle that man he's too big then he's supposed to be my father but down inside i knew he wasn't my father i knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that and everyone says amen right now i went over and i grabbed him by the collar and i turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when i said that my muscles grew and i looked like a giant the man saw them and he was scared of me i said you strike her again you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me i woke immediately after the dream i thought how strange that was i wondered why i had dreamed about that woman when suddenly there he came and the prince of god became known to me and the interpretation of the dream came from him now you people know that not only have i interpreted your dreams exactly but i have many times told you what you dreamed so that you never had to tell me the woman represents the church of the world today i was born right into this mess the mess that she is in she is supposed to be a kind of a mother she is the mother of harlots her husband is the denominations that rule her the three cornered block is a false trying baptism unto a trinity every time she started to rise up that means the congregation begins to accept truth he would drive her right down again with that false doctrine he was so great that i was afraid of him at first but when i came against them i found i had great and powerful muscles they were faith muscles the outcome of the dream was that since god is with me and can give me such strength then then let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her now we have read about zechariah you know we read there in zechariah where where joshua was the high priest but satan was there to was resist him from coming to his god ordained position and this spirit here that brother abraham had this dream about this this spirit now has been an antichrist spirit that has been trying to stop the church coming to its god-given position now we can say well we're not baptized in a trinitarian formula you know we do not take on the titles of father son holy ghost but we are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but that spirit you know spirits just change their outward form they change their outward form but their intent remains the same so the same the same spirit that tried to destroy israel was the same antichrist spirit that tried to destroy the church it just changed its form now we we know we are living in a time of the breaking of cycles you know there has to be a time where the cycle of revival and death comes to an end and it does not end in death but it ends in revival amen the first you know you we can see the cycle all the way down through the scriptures from from the time of judges down through the church ages you know the first generation they're liber you know they're liberated from demon power they walk in liberty they walk in christ but then but then the revival begins to cool off until the next generation finds itself in bondage again yet religious or they um i mean or they are the next generation you know then then they call out for liberation for god to liberate them god liberates them only for the following generation or even themselves falling into bondage and slavery again cycle of revival and death the prophet tells us never fails but there has to come a time when this finishes hallelujah and i believe now you know that we are living in a time where that cycle will be broken that there will be a revival fire not in just one generation but in every generation so that revival will be burning in me will be burning in my children if the lord should tarry and my grandchildren hallelujah because there should be you know we could have a revival in ourselves i mean the welsh revival wasn't people well it just wasn't in the country it was in people hallelujah so you know we can have that same revival that same holy ghost that poured himself out there and azusa street can pour himself out right now because he's the same yesterday today and forever so now we can say we're living at the end of cycles because we're living at the end of the seventh church age there's no more cycle of church ages to continue there's no eighth church change there's no ninth church age we're at the end the next thing that's going to roll on is eternity so even death will come to an end the cycle of life and death will come to an end where life where death will be swallowed up in victory hallelujah that's the scripture amen so this is what we're looking for so this cycle cannot continue but it must come to an end the same as that cycle of that antichrist spirit coming in and beating down a people that they begin to rise up that cycle of of a people rising up just to be beaten down to raise up again and be beaten down that cycle must come to an end and that cycle is coming in to an end in this day hallelujah i believe that we're a people that you know we can we can actually grab that through egypt club and say satan no more you can't beat me down no more you can't use my past again me you can't use my natural lineage circumstance you can't use nothing against me amen so that now it's very interesting when brother brahm has his dream because he relates it in two places if i can find it and it's just before so so he relates at the week uh of the weekend before he preaches services is the time of the end and the and then he relates it in that sermon as well and we know in that sermon he's you know he's just had the visitation there of the you know he's going to meet the seven angels there you know out west and he's very moved by that experience and you know he thought maybe it's the end of his ministry but it's actually just a continuation of his ministry where the book will come open and you know so he relates now the breaking of the cycle with the word coming open hallelujah because we're living down in this time now as i said a spirit just changes its outward appearance but its intent is always the same now this spirit will fight us until it's thrown into the lake of fire we're not exempt from anything but we have power to overcome everything right so we're not exempt from trials troubles hardship spirits come in whatever it may be we're not exempt from nothing that's in the world but we have overcoming power to defeat that thing hallelujah because because the word says greater is in you that's in the world amen so now if you look at this deed of the nicolaitans down through the church ages it just evolved where it went from deeds so deeds is just well why do you do this oh because we do it this way it becomes a deed and then a few church ages later it became a doctrine it became a fundamental part of the belief system of the church but the lord said he hated this thing and the whole purpose of that spirit was to basically you know we know nicolaitan it means to conquer the people so to conquer a pea a people is very simple you just take the holy ghost from them you're you replace the living god that's living in their lives overcoming power with creed and dogma and just going through the motion of a religious worship so so that is that was always the purpose of it it was to take the holy ghost from the people because some people say well the nicolaitans was just a sect within christianity within the first few ages but history says that wasn't true it was a spirit antichrist spirit worming its way into the church to take the overcoming power from the people it came in subtly it may be sounded so good because you know the nicolaitan spirit is is basically manifested in the priesthood or the ministers become different greater than the people so the holy ghost instead of the people being a part of the spiritual worship in the church the holy ghost are that's just on the minister because they're the anointed person and so it separates the ministry from the laity but we're actually all the same glory i'm glad we're all the same i just happen to stand here a bit more than some other people but yeah we're all the same hallelujah so it's not it's not just meant to be inspired inspired ministry and people trying to grasp but the same inspiration that falls on the minister should be the same inspiration that hears the word through you amen transforms our lives together hallelujah so how does that begin well people begin to lift up a ministry and that ministry instead of actually know humbling itself and saying you know i'm just like you they get lifted up in pride and then people elevate that man or that woman or that person above everyone else we must never do that because it takes the anointing from the people and puts it somewhere else we must never ever let that antichrist spirit come in our midst it'll try to elevate someone above the people as antichrist and to actually say well they're anointed i don't need to be anointed that's antichrist and this spirit is a condescending spirit it will make young people look like they're nothing it'll de-spiritualize people that's that antichrist spirit working trying to de-christianize people as nicolaite and move because it's someone trying to say i'm greater than you and you've got nothing i've got everything and trying to dominate people trying to get them to make to to become subservient to human leadership we should be subservient to the word amen it's a spirit that tries to make people inferior of their own christian walk and basically de-christianize others but you know brother brown asked a question who's got more power before god sons and daughters of god or angels and he says in kinsmen redeemer an angel is a servant that's right they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has more power in heaven than a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by the by his right side the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than an archangel that stood by a side without sin because he's a son a son has more authority than a servant of course so someone who just gave their lives to the lord but a second ago is more authority in heaven than gabriel himself or michael or one of the archangels why because they're sons sons and daughters they mean to never ever let anyone try and de-christianize what the lord has done in your life now the devil will be fighting this or fighting you trying to push you out of your god-ordained position amen until he's thrown into like your fire that's why he tries to push people out of ministry tries to push people out of doing anything in the church tries to just say he just tries to make them sit down and shut up and just warm up you we're not called to warm pews we can put the ac on and the poos will be warm you know we don't need that i mean we all have part of this work the expectation of the people really dictates how how a service will be amen because how come camp is so awesome there's an expectation we're going to camp and god's going to meet us and he does why because he meets our expectation we can have that same expectation for now hallelujah amen or even when you open your bible when you pray you have that same expectation lord i'm coming to camp harley why because what makes camp god makes camp jesus makes camp camp amen so he'll try and fight us and you know to try and kick us out of our ordained position but we have by the authority of god's word we've got to kick him off his our mountain amen kick him off our mountain now the bible says in revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was grounded she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saint so it's granted unto a people to be arrayed in the righteousness of god so it's not something we push and push out whatever it's actually him saying here put on the winning government put on this word and something just and you just says this fits me real good amen hallelujah now brother brown says god of this evil lady says and when the entire word of god incomplete was headed up in the human body called jesus christ and there uh and and their god made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what god has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you're seated there you'll use it for your ordained to do what you do i mean so if you're seated in heavenly place in christ jesus amen you'll use it you'll use that position hallelujah amen the devil gets on my case i just go talk to my daddy and my daddy's bigger than his daddy hallelujah so my dad's going to beat him up hallelujah so we don't need to be afraid of anything hallelujah because he's ordained us to sit and in a position amen we need to look at now now brother man says in christ the mystery god revealed the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed it to you this great mystery and there and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfect in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is so yeah the scripture says that we will know as we are known and we need to come to that place and say god may we know as we're known as we're known by you may we know about ourselves amen because remember in our opening scripture he already was the high priest he did not become the high priest by the changing of his garments he says that joshua he showed me joshua the hype he's standing before the angel lord so he already was the high priest he did not become the high priest by the devil being rebuked from him and his raymond being changed no he already was the high priest but god had to come i mean we fight a supernatural devil how can we overcome a supernatural enemy with natural means we cannot do it we cannot overcome it by human reasoning i mean by intellect it takes the anointing it's the anointing that breaks the yoke amen of the devil amen hallelujah so he already was high priest but the lord had to come and rebuke this enemy that was trying to stop him coming into his position and then he received the change of ramen to exercise the office of high priest i'll just say this we already were the bride of christ we did not become the bride of christ by this message no we already were but because we were we responded to the word just like the eagle in the chicken yard when mama came flying over saying son flop your wings come up here he did not become an eagle because he heard the scream no the screen made him recognize hey i'm an eagle hallelujah holy and they're never going to soar up into the heavenlies they mean there's a call up into the heavenlies i mean it's the same thing with the lord amen we are his we already were his sons and daughters the scripture says because ye were sons you receive the spirit so not you do not become you do not receive the spirit of god by receiving the holy ghost you receive the holy ghost because you are if the church only knew what it was it will one day than the rapture will go amen yes hallelujah amen we are ordained see satan was there to resist joshua coming into his god-given position and that same one is trying to withstand you but we're ordained to overcome now brother braham says in the message how can i overcome overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that god the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him hallelujah so our lord has already overcome all temptation all peer pressure all addiction all trials every culture everything he overcame hell death in the grave you know we used to play back in days to play computer games you say well i clocked the game well our lord this is probably a bad way of saying it but he clocked everything he conquered hell death in the grave conquered sickness everything he just won hallelujah so you've got to recognize the one in you the holy ghost in you has already overcome that devil i mean he overcame him in heaven he was cast out amen he overcame a noah's day moses day elijah's day all the way down through hallelujah amen amen and by his grace you're more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say i'm doing this and i'm doing that no no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you'll then you realize that you've overcome and you know that he's the devil you say i've got a sickness i i don't believe it's a sickness yes it's a sickness you've got cancer you well you don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you that he than he that's in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he is in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming now to so to overcome i was going to take that first phrase there is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks because he's he's in the job of blindsiding people amen so you've got to be able to recognize every one of his tricks now one of the tricks of this day especially this age is the deception of validating one's christian walk or state of their family by comparison put up put up revelations 3 and we're going to read room 14. this is a big pressure of the day you're going to recognize the devil in his tricks amen amen amen revelations 3 and 14 and on and unto the angel of the church of the latest years right these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth because thou sayest now this is i think the first time through the church ages that god is actually repeating back to the age this is what your confession is because thou says i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing now why would how can you say your rich increase with goods and have need of nothing unless there's a comparison because to say you're rich increase with goods either the ages comparing themselves with others well i'm richer than this family or where this nation's richer than that nature i mean i mean nation that's a comparison or they're comparing what they used to be with what they are now i was once poor but now i'm rich increased with goods so there's a there's a comparison between either yourself or a former state so this is a time of comparison because they're saying look at what we have look what we've obtained we've made it i have need of nothing amen what because it's a comparison thing look at how the churches used to be and look what we have now i'm so glad we're not what we used to be well that's a comparison there's only one thing we should compare with and that's god's bible amen brother brown says in the resurrection of lazarus a day that we're living in is a great matching time do you believe that paint your steps read and watch all the neighbors they get theirs read right away matching time everybody wants to impersonate somebody else how true that is match i always said i don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my shirt match my coat i want my experience to match god's bible when he said you must be born again when they receive the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost i want that i want my experience to match that amen amen because if you go into a comparison way of looking at everything it actually makes the blindness because they're saying look i'm rich and i'm creased with goods i have need of nothing and knows not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked i cancel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see what is that seeing the spiritual condition of yourself not comparing well my walker's better than that person's walker i'm glad my family's not like this family and my children aren't like this children that's actually blindness because it's carnal comparison we are not ordained to match one another i can even say i'm not your example why does he know what he mean right there i need to say for this is our example right joe the apostle paul said follow me as i follow christ we understand that but the word is our example we're to match you're not to match with you know this church is not here to make little ben gloins amen we're not even here to be little william branhams amen we're here to be made in the image of christ the word i mean that's why the prophet's ministry came is that jesus christ will pour himself into a people and he would manifest his word and a people that when god looks down at you he doesn't see you he sees himself in you and which is his word made manifest they mean more than an intellectual understanding more than a debate but a resurrected jesus christ a resurrected power living in you and i amen this is what this is what christianity is isn't that god will dwell in people once again amen hallelujah amen when you read through the epistles and the apostle paul is talking about how men should be a woman should be your children should be you should look at that and say ah that's living out of me that's right amen why because your life is actually the interpretation of the scripture if the author is in you then your life will interpret the scripture your life will be a living bible don't you want to be a living bible amen hallelujah well what part are you living ephesians galatians no the whole thing all that christ is hallelujah amen let it be at me it's a great matching time now we turn to luke 18 and we can see there's a matching time there's a blindness of a of a worshiper in the temple in the any uh jesus spake of this parable uh unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous that sounds like the latest cnh i'm rich increases goods they trust themselves that they're righteous and woe unto any who says actually you need more people get offended now that they are righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray one a pharisee the other republican the pharisees stood and prayed thus with with himself god i thank thee that i'm not as other men are extortionist unjust adulterers or even this publican so he's saying lord i'm so glad i'm not this guy he's actually blind this guy this guy's actually richard miseral paul blind naked doesn't even know his spiritual state he may be outwardly rich and and you know doing well and looking so holy and you know having a form of godliness but he he's just all he cares about is matching this guy we never want to be in this state but this is the condition of this age i fast twice in the week i give ties of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off see he's just talking about his works what about his heart you know that's the most important thing what's the condition of our hearts today you know we can have such a reasoning that our mirror that we are reflecting in to make sure we look fine is actually a wrong one you know brother brown would tell a story of a of of a lady that will actually turn down the truth and she was dying she actually grew up became a sunday school teacher and all of her little sunday school class actually came into the hospital room to see her be carried away by the angels and her her pastor some denominational man was just out outside smoking up and down the hallway and and but but she thinks she's fine because she's been comparing herself with something but not the word but then when she begins to die her reasoning and all that veil begins to lift and her true spiritual state comes to the forefront and she actually realizes i'm lost and she cries out i'm lost you deceive her calling to her pastor i'm lost and she cries out she tries to get that your holy roller girl whatever come down lost and she died in that condition because beforehand she thought well i'm fine look i'm a sunday school teacher i did this and this and i've done this but her spiritual state was she was gone and she didn't realize it until her reasoning left her we never want to be in that condition we never want to be in that condition where the rapture goes and we say why am i left behind or we're on death's door we realize i actually don't know the lord i may be in church all my life may have said the right thing's going through the motions of baptism different things but you know do we really know him that's probably the biggest thing do we really know him in this hour is he really personal is he alive i mean is his word more than ink on paper more than messages on tape but he's a is he a living god i mean not not because it's a learned behavior to be a message believer that's probably the worst thing you could ever be in but it's a personal relationship with a resurrected lord jesus christ and you can actually see him living in you amen but this man this republican standing afar off could not so as much lift his eyes into heaven but smote his breasts saying god be merciful to me a sinner now this word merciful this is just from um scofield's notes he says so he says this so this word in the greek it ties into the mercy seat and this greek word is used in the septuagint and the new testament in connection with the mercy seat as an as as an instructor jew this publican is thinking not of mere mercy but of the blood sprinkled mercy seat his prayer might be paraphrased lord be towards me as thou art when thou look us upon the atoning blood hallelujah shouldn't that be our hearts cry lord when you look upon me may you look upon me as you look upon your returning blood may you not see my faults my humanity anything may you only see your sacrifice that was given on my behalf and not me and this man went away justified oh leah why because he wasn't comparing himself with anything he said lord i just want to be when you look down at me may you not see my reasoning or my religious ability and what i think i may only see your atoning blood may you look upon me and when you see me may you see your atoning blood hallelujah why because the blood of christ speaks better things than that of abel abel's blood can only cry out for justice but the blood of jesus christ not only cries out but it redeems amen hallelujah and i tell you now this is this is luke 18 14 i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted hallelujah now another trick of the devil so let's not compare remember the scripture says if we compare ourselves with ourselves we're unwise if we compare if i compare my children with someone else's children i'm unwise if i compare my home life with other people's home life see there's a problem with social media it was like look at my holidays look at my life look at this and a comparison begins to happen you know subconsciously well i don't have that i don't have this i don't need the i don't have this one it becomes a carnal comparison i don't care if i'm on the street i don't care if i have to live in my car i want my experience to match god's bible i want to go to the rapture so we we're not here to compare ourselves with ourselves i want to be a wise man i want to compare myself with the scripture say lord am i walking daily by your side am i actually walking with you or am i just walking with an idol crafted out of the scripture says this is jesus we don't want to do that now another trick is he causes us to respond carnally because of what other people do numbers 20 and 10 if you've got that we can throw that up here's moses he has already been commissioned by god he's already brought the people out of egypt he's already stood in the gap for them that lord take my life you know don't take their life take my life block my name out of the book he stood in the gap he's done many incredible things the lord's used them in mighty ways but he comes to a spot where he just gets sick and tired of what he sees because he has been you just think about his job many times we think walking with the lord is a glamorous thing that's not a glamorous thing there's trouble there's strife there's murmuring there's people you can never please not looking anyone particular when i say that you know so don't take that person you know but this oh boy yeah people think he's looking at me i just happen to be looking at you okay you know so i just i just look up here something you know but you know but you know you can't you can't please yes so he has to put up with us what two million or a million people were however many you know and and he just gets sick of their murmuring and so he says to them and moses now and gathered the congregation together before the rock and said unto them here now ye rebels must we fetch water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also he just got angry i'm sick of you talking to me like this i'm sick of this murmuring this bad atmosphere in the church here i'm sick of this going on do i have to do this for you it's what happened is this is a trick of the devil to get us to calmly respond to what other people are doing why did they lose so he lost their call because of all their murmuring and complaining but what caused the people to be this way it's because of they unbelief in the wilderness because they did not believe it says in hebrews 3 but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear that he that they should not enter into his rest of to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief so this murmuring was a manifestation of unbelief and we know that all sin boils down to unbelief everything has just attributes of that and so here he's responding calmly because of their unbelief has been projected upon him with with the murmuring now brother abraham says this and um this is an uh the way to have fellowship he says that's where it is tonight i'll say that's where it is this morning god has to give it then love produces a fellowship when god said back there the day that sin that separated that divine love god told adam and eve not to eat of these certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice strife envy is that right what happened they separated from divine love and when you separate from divine love you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more you've got to ball him out for it that's right you can't overlook sister's mistakes no more because you've gone away from that divine part that love part pardon me but if you really love the lord jesus now notice what he's putting this he doesn't say if you really love them if you really love the lord jesus if brother or sister does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that christ had father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what if he had held my sins against me what an awful person i was and i say mean to me but he was he loved me so well that he forgave me for them when i was undone he forgave me he loved me a pure love and when adam separated himself from pure love of god uh from pure love of keeping god's word in his heart when he did that then he began then other faculties come in malice envy strife hatred and so forth so when someone is separated from divine love this is what comes forth so these people were being motivated by unbelief and it caused them to murmur and complain and act in the flesh and that was a trick of the devil to get moses to react in the flesh he didn't lose his salvation but he didn't go into the promised land that's a trick of the devil now caleb and john no no i i love bible stories i just love today you just think about this because you know sometimes you just think there's aaron and there's moses and all the you know then there's all the murmurs but caleb and joshua were standing there too but you know the thing is about them is they weren't murmuring and complaining they weren't upset remember they were as thirsty as everyone else was thirsty their camels or their whatever animals were as thirsty and hungry as the other purples camels and livestock but there was something within them that their current circumstance did not cause them to murmur their current circumstance really caused them this is me to rejoice why is that because we're a day closer to crossing and we're a day closer to crossing and they journey a bit more we're going closer hallelujah hallelujah because remember they had a revelation anchor into their soul i mean that they were bound for the promised land and they were gonna caleb was gonna get his mountain amen so they did not sympathize with the murmurs and the complainers because they did not want that spirit to jump on them you know how spirits jump on people you open yourself up to that spirit that's why entertainment is such a powerful tool in the tools of the devil i mean in the hand of the devil cause you open up to it a spirit jumps on people and people get emotional when they're having discussions with people and what is that actually it can just be a spirit trying to get the other person to sympathize and they get emotional then that spirit jumps on them amen are we aware of this you know you've got to be careful you're not sympathizing with a spirit hey sure we should sympathize with one another when we go through hard times i'm not talking about become a robot now and be emotionally detached and not feel people's infirmities all these things but you know you've got to be careful what you're sympathizing with now brother brown would say in in jehovah jireh 55 he says there's a spirit coming from the woman calling in the audience now he's in a prayer line he's going to pray for this woman but there's a spirit from the woman there's an evil spirit of sickness calling to someone something else you see demons sympathize with one another they call help if they can only reinforce it enough to get this woman to disbelieve she'll walk off with her same condition there's something wrong with her if they get her to disbelieve if the angel lord can get a hold of her enough to get the vision started then she'll go away believing and receive he's his buddy's calling he says and how um how the angel came to me in 1953 sitting right here looking here right on on down that road there you have bell trouble hanging over you you believe that god will make you well cold and conditioned do you believe he'll make you well you want to accept your healing now you do stand up to your feet then god bless you go ahead home now you'll get well that's satan i seen it moving back and i didn't know where it hit see it was sympathizing with that same spirit you can go home now and be well god bless you so the devil's trying to sympathize to gain power so that happens in human beings as well caleb and joshua didn't sympathize with the murmurs i'm thirsty caleb this is horrible i'm sick of this place praise the lord i'm thirsty but i'm on my way to a drink holly i'm walking with the rock amen i'm going to cross the jordan i'm going to take him out do you want me to tell you about the mountain i'm going to get you know and there'll come a time where the murmurs had nothing to do with joshua and caleb because they're like man i'm not talking to them anymore because they don't take on my pity party hallelujah this is a horrible place to be hold on are we slaves no we're not slaves no more well i'm a better condition here than me unless i'm free this i'm walking with god at least i'm on my way to canaan's fair land amen hallelujah amen so you know they were in the same condition but a revelation dropped in their hearts we're crossing jordan and the thing is they did it hallelujah so never ever respond in a carnal way when when the devil tries to get you to do that no no we got to respond in a real godly way amen now let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation now where are we okay why why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature he's just as immutable in his ways thus satan knows assuredly that the original church of pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus christ claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discreting of god's word right down to the time he's cast the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thoughted today as when christ will stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now i find it interesting that that that the prophet would pick out the lord overcoming the devil in the desert as as a uh as an example of how the true church will overcome in this day now if we go to matthew chapter four we can see you know that the devil tempts the lord in you know three ways and you know i'm sure we all know this very well but you know the first thing he weighs charizard now now in all these temptations he is trying to make the lord jesus prove to him that he is the son of god if thou be we don't have to prove to the devil nothing if you're the bride of christ do this and if you're really the bride and if the words really restore do this we don't have to do nothing we don't have to answer the devil at all you know we're he is not our god satan was trying to lead jesus through certain things that's an antichrist move is to be led by the devil right the power of god leads us according to the word we don't have to prove nothing to the devil amen so he tempts him in three different ways the first one of course because he had fasted for 40 days and nights he afterwards and hung it and the tempter came to and said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread now jesus was hungry so the devil was trying to make him use the gift or the power that he had for his own personal gain but the thing was really inspired by the devil as we know that's why he said get behind me satan so he can inspire you to use the gift in your life for your own personal gain hallelujah so we can have we can have a we can have a gift we can just influence people real easy some of us have just got that kind of a nature around us you can just rally people around and influence things and you know so the devil will try and get us to use a gift in our lives for our own personal gain he will lead us if we're not careful to subtly run down people to other people to kill their influence to make ourselves look better that is the devil leading someone but you say get thee behind me satan you know you think about the prophet you didn't know who his friends or his enemies were because he spoke about people all the same way he didn't belittle anyone to anyone amen help us lord i mean the next things that he made you know the devil took him up to the holy city set him on the pinnacle of the temple and then the devil quoted the scripture to him and said if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time they dash thou dash thy foot against the stone now it appears like he is quoting psalms 91 word for word but when we go to psalms 91 he's not quoting it word for word he omits part of the scripture so if we go to psalms 91 11 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways so he left out the part to keep thee in all thy ways so he's omitting part of it to try and get power over the lord well what's that got to do with us well here's a quote that people love to throw around brother brahm says the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but is that the whole statement no because brother it says but the person of jesus but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did so he says the mystery of the baptism the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did hallelujah it's not just oh i've got the holy ghost without sensation what happened to you i don't know it's without sensation is your life change ah well i believe the word mentally and there's no life there's no manifestation of the word man you know there's no there's no supernatural life living through you oh but i've got the holy ghost because he said without sensation that's not what he says amen he says the person of christ will perform in you the same works that he did so there will be a genuine you contribute you should be able to look back in your life and say i saw the lord live here and here and here and here and he did this and he's done this and he's done this why because there's a book of acts being written amen amen amen so brother brahm says this he says he says in the token he says that i said last night up in new york at one of the messages if i told you that shakespeare lived in me i do the works of shakespeare because i couldn't help it i'm no more myself i'm dead shakespeare and i can't live together in here shakespeare was a poet i and i'm a minister we can't live together but if i am dead to myself and shakespeare lives in me the works of shakespeare i'll do the life of shakespeare in me will be lived out like shakespeare if the life of beethoven lived in me i'd be beethoven if the life of john dillinger lived in me i would be john dillinger that's right and if the life of jesus christ lives in the person they become identified with him it's christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the holy ghost as a token upon you and your life says amen to every scripture the promise is written in there hallelujah what did jesus do he cast out devils he raised the dead he spoke in tongues he rejoiced hallelujah what do you mean he rejoiced well it says in luke 10 and 21 and that same hour jesus rejoiced in spirit now if you go look on you know some children's cartoon bible program they take hippie jesus and he just goes praise the lord you know you know but when it says that he rejoiced in spirit that word in the greek means to jump for joy it means to be to be exceeding joy to rejoice so when he rejoiced in spirit he was really rejoicing hallelujah amen if he causes you to do that well that's all fight hallelujah but you know and definitely you will manifest the word for your age hallelujah now in the invisible union of the bride of christ in a true picture of the modern church today neither does it neither does the modern church want any of these screaming shouting acts speaking 238 youngins around here yeah yeah yeah see she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that and one of the churches why they'd throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff as this go along so you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belong to here they'll throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because it's the only kind the word can bring forth now when i talk about these things i talk about these four walls they can do what they do i'm talking about us we need you know you know the lord said to us a few years ago now if if he be lifted up because there's a burden how we're going to keep our young people and there was a response from the spirit of god if i be lifted up like moses lifted up the bra serpent i will draw them to myself was basically what was said so now now the question is how do we lift them up do we just get stricter do we just get more no there's got to be a a life that's projected there's got to be the resurrected power there's got to be an atmosphere around us that will actually draw our children draw our adults draw everyone aiming to himself isn't that what we want hardly it not to not to a creed not to an argument not to just well you've got to shape up or ship out but there's got to be a resurrected power amen that will draw the people hallelujah amen amen amen that's how we've got to be amen if god lives in us shouldn't we be that way amen if we have the works of christ what did the what did the lord do there was a life in him that drew people to himself hallelujah amen we should be the same way [Music] amen now we've got to understand there's a power in the church today that is more than a match for the devil there's more than a match this spirit with this three-edged club will try and beat you down that's right but we there's a power released in the church today that will overcome it you know what does he try and use against us that we're not worthy i'm just going to try and script skip a few things how does a how does how does the devil try and beat us down i'm not worthy enough yes what's our worthiness got to do with it that's right really in the old testament when the worshiper brought the lamb a sin offering or turtle doves but we'll just use the lamb for an example as soon as the priest saw that lamb he didn't look at the worshipper it doesn't say in the book of the book of leviticus and thou shalt bring your lamb without blemish to the priest and he shall sit you down for three hours and examine you and when you've been found worthy that you offer the lamb on your behalf i don't read that i read when and you shall bring your sin offering and the priest shall examine the sin offering and if it shall be found without blemish you shall be offered on your behalf that's what the word says right so so our worthiness has got nothing to do with nothing say the devil because because he uses our sincere good intentions against ourselves because we want to be like the lord we want to be holy we want to be perfect we want to walk with him we don't want to upset him in any way and you know and the devil just uses that against us our sincerity he'll use against us right and then we beat ourselves down saying lord i'm just not worthy but in reality true we're not worthy that's right but it's not our worthiness it's it's it's our lamb if our lamb has been accepted then i'm accepted now in the old testament the priest just examined the lamb he didn't talk to me he didn't even worry about the worshiper his burden was this has to be found perfect and if this has been found perfect i can offer this on his behalf and he could now walk away justified because the blood was enough to atone for his sins hallelujah and our perfect lamb stood before pilate many false acts you know many false accusers came before him but then paul just says i find no fault in this man hallelujah and then he was taken glory and he was offered without the gate hallelujah then he ascended up high came back down amen his blood was accepted his blood at times for you and i hallelujah then we can say well i'm worthy because he's worthy amen remember all of the press you think about in the old testament remember the wife is the responsibility of the husband so it all sits on the pressure of that wife to be looked after to be god to be protected everything to be to be nourished is all on the husband if he fails she fails but if he succeeds she succeeds oh our husband succeeded i don't know if you realize that or not he succeeded right he made us in such a way by his blood that we're without blame unreapprovable blame let's just let's just i have that somewhere i'm sure i put it down it was it was first oh no it's in colossians 1 and 22. so the lamb is accepted and if the lamb is accepted we're accepted hallelujah and if you have the high priest you have the blood and what did brother braham say he said who did she touch who did he touch they were this many feet away did they touch the high priest he's the high priest who touched by the feeling of our infirmities and so what was happening the high priest was standing on the platform revealing himself to a prophet amen so if you have the high priest you have the blood and we have the word brother i said this is not my message this is god's message within it is the true revelation of jesus christ so if you have the high priest you have the blood we have the high priest do we not glory amen that's probably a whole subject in itself but you know we are the lord has made us worthy now you look at this now we'll come to that i'm going to read this first ephesians 1 and 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved so he's made me accepted i don't need to prove nothing and then and then colossians 1 22 sorry we'll put that back up and the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight now you think about god you can trick me you can tell me certain things and you can put on a certain angle which you know which is not the truth right but god sees everything god sees everything so now god is going to make a people i believe i'm looking at them right now remember you know this is me when i read these scriptures i just think he's talking about me how does he know how i am amen remember this is what he has done for you and i that we would be unblamable that means without blame blemish fault or spot you got no spot you got no blemish you got no fault and faultless unblameable and unreprovable which means unaccused you cannot be accused in his sight that's what the blood does takes away anything oh we beat ourselves up with things out the blood takes care of it all hallelujah now another thing that he beats us up with and and i'll just close with this one because time is has has marched or jumped on brother brown says the comment full obedience to the whole word of god to god's entire word entitles you to this token who's heard him say this so immediately well this is in my little brain which anyway probably doesn't count for much but in my little mind as soon as that is said subconsciously now we begin to think well have i been good enough and have i been good enough for long enough and have i been obedient to the full word of god and now i've got to look through everything i need to do and you know and then there's a lot of pressure and you know am i you know and then and then it comes a performance thing right the devil twisted in people's minds that you have to be and and to me this is what discourages a lot of people they say well i can't do this so i'm going to quit what's the point of trying but now so basically what this is saying if you just take this and not what he says after this remember the devil took a part of scripture and quoted it to jesus not the whole thing so he'll use the message use the scripture against you the same way and so now basically this is saying that people have to earn the holy ghost by their own merit if you just take that isolated statement so they say well what's the point i can't do it i'm a failure to be good with so might as well quit but brother braham says this in the token he says now you want eternal life you receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood it's the token of the blood the life itself amen full obedience to the whole word of god to god's entire word will entitle you to this token and then he says how do you do it i'm like yeah yeah i'm so glad he just throws the quest yo the question i have he already puts it out there amen he says then so how do you do it question mark peter said on the day of pentecost now what i'm about to read is is this is how you do full obedience to the full word of god entitles you to the token peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost to token for the promises unto you and to your children them that are far off even as men as the lord our god shall call i mean so what he is saying is full obesity the full word of god that will entitle you to this token is to repent have godly sorrow for your sin turn from it amen surrender your whole life to god be baptized name the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the token that is full obedience the full word of god is acts 238 it's that simple hallelujah amen if you do this and he you're entitled to the token that is full obesity full word of god what about every other part of the word well if you fall in love with him and you meet him your life will begin to manifest you'll dress right talk right act right speak right you'll god will do it in you but that is full of peace the full word of god entitles you to this token glory hallelujah amen it's really beautifully that simple now i'm just gonna pause there and we'll pick it up some other time but don't let the devil beat you around we ordained joshua was ordained to be the high priest satan was withstanding him and god came and cast him out that he could come to his god ordained place that he was already meant to be if you've got a longing in your soul i want to i want to walk with you lord i want to know you it's because there's a god to meet that longing and just take that longing and fight through everything of darkness that try and hold you back well that's all you've got to do you say lord i've got a desire i've got a longing here i come amen hallelujah amen so this devil with this threat your club i pray it dies right now in the name of jesus christ i mean these things that i'm not good enough i'm not worthy how can i ever get the holy ghost all these things i just pray it's all dead amen let's walk on with god hallelujah amen can the musicians please come this morning amen we're just going to leave it there this morning hallelujah amen hallelujah i want to sing he didn't let the devil win hallelujah hallelujah amen amen shall we make mistakes shall we fall shall we fail but if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen amen that's saying he didn't let the devil win and then we'll go to how great is our god after that then amen amen and d is that what we want to do amen well he didn't let the devil win he didn't let the devil win he didn't let the devil win he didn't let the devil [Applause] [Applause]
