except we did do one practice round and this was our um so this was our uh lesson this morning it's a little bit well we've we've changed it a little bit can you hold this for a second I'm going to be reading the script um so thank you um so you know how Jesus used Parables to tell a lesson and that was kind of the thought my my beginning thought and um then it kind of turned into a little bit of a play so anyways I hope you enjoy um this you'll get from it and um if you put on your spiritual jackets as brother Marcus um yeah as the brother says um you'll you'll get the gist behind it is about by by Grace we are saved right okay so this is Christina AKA Christian um I'm gonna tell this story this Story begins with a Christian named Christina and the devil having a conversation Christina said I got a ticket last night I gave my heart to Jesus and I got a ticket into heaven she's got a ticket but you know what the you know what the devil always does whenever you you get you have an experience and there's always somebody sneaking around we're ready to tell you that's not true so um I was going to read first Peter 5 8 which is what happened be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking who whom he may defer and the devil said you don't actually believe that it's just a trick you won't make it if I can stop you oh yeah there's Christine um where was I um Christina said but I'm a good person my parents taught me to read my Bible and pray every day I've got good morals I do good things I'm I'm a good Christian but the devil said there's a lot of good people out there and they're going to Straight to Hell where I want them but Chris so Christina got desperate really desperate and she prayed and she prayed and she prayed some more until she knew that she had surrendered everything to the Lord and God gave her an assurance and a confirmation of where her journey would take her but do you think the devil was done do you think the devil was done no he said okay you think you gotta figure it out but you know how he likes to be all sneaky right one of his favorite tricks is to distract so he snuck up on Christina when she wasn't completely focused and said I'm gonna get that ticket from you I'll just steal your joy oh steal some more joy yeah well steal your happiness I'll steal your peace you know what he does and he ran away laughing but first he's got a rip of two-thirds of the ticket away because that's exactly what the devil does when when we have an experience hello so Christina got on her knees and asked God forgive for forgiveness for listening to the wrong voice as all Christians must when they make mistakes she opened her Bible and found Ephesians 2 verse 8 and 9. Fool by grace and none of your cells it is a gift of God no works with any Manchester best yeah So eventually because there's too many times like this that we can't tell the tell the whole story like ever a whole life story in 10 minutes but Christina finally made um she finally got to the Pearly Gates and the angel at the gate asked to see her ticket and Christina started to weep she said I was given my ticket I've held it close but the devil came when I wasn't watching and ripped off two-thirds of my ticket and now I only have this I've done the best that I could to take care of it but I don't I don't know if you can let me in I was reading the other day in Ephesians 2 verse 8 and it says that by Grace were saved so I was wondering if there'd be Mercy for me that maybe I could still come in and meanwhile the devil's Advocates came behind Christina waving the pieces of the ticket they had stolen from Christina's ticket trying to taunt her with fear and lies only the devil knows how to do but the angel said I need to read some instructions first and gabes are Gabe's is going to read the instructions [Music] go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain there whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you amen it was him that chose us right so the angel said to give me everybody give me the pieces of your tickets and we're gonna lay it out and see see where um you know you know when you go to a play or you go to you get in a plane they tell you okay you're on road D4 because you've got that written on your ticket right so um I can't really I can't show you it right now come stand up we're not actually gonna do what we did in the Sunday school class because nobody can really see it but if you unfold this is the two-thirds the devil took and this is the third that she had left just hang on I'll show you the I'll show you what the devil got it was his um his seating and this is what it said once you lay it out and what's that pardon me behind us oh sorry yeah can you see I'm sorry if you laid out all the pieces that the devil had taken this is what it said and and then show us what what you had at the Pearly Gates thank you that's it by Grace we are saved [Applause] um I thought it the second um the second part of the verse had a really fitting line and I've been meaning to sing it for a while foreign if you listen to the the words of the second verse it's really fitting because we know we know how the story ends even though the enemy might not know we know and that's our Assurance right [Music] oh [Music] the weapon may be formed but it won't prosper in the darkness fall when the Darkness Falls it won't prevail cause oh God I serve knows only how to Triumph oh my God will never fail [Music] oh my God will never fail and I'm gonna see your Victory I'm gonna see your victory for the battle belong to the Lord I'm gonna see your Victory I'm gonna see your victory for The Battle Belongs to the Lord there's power in the mighty name of Jesus and every war he wages he will win and I'm not backing down from any Giants cause I know how the story ends yes I know how this story ends and I'm gonna see my victory I'm gonna see your victory for The Battle Belongs to the Lord I'm gonna sing my victory I'm gonna see your victory for The Battle Belongs to the Lord you take what the enemy meant for evil and you turn in for good you turn it for good you take with the Enemy meant for evil and you turn it for good Lord you turn it for good all you take it you take with the Enemy meant for evil and you turn it for good you're turning for good or do you turn it for good turning for good you're turning for good turn it for good would you turn it for good and I'm gonna sing my victory I'm gonna see my victory for The Battle Belongs to the Lord I'm gonna see my victory I'm gonna see a victory for The Battle Belongs to the Lord yes The Battle Belongs to the Lord Belongs to the Lord thank you [Applause] amen sister near me thank you for that foreign Jesus Jesus [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] all of my ambitions [Music] the Earth [Music] thank you if you love for it's only foreign [Music] you're willing to Jesus [Music] oh Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] me Jesus all for Jesus amen amen let's pray almighty God we want to give you thanks for all your blessings Lord I want to give you thanks Lord because all you Misses for all your blessings Lord upon us be with us Lord I want to ask you to use me Lord I want to ask you to be with us in this meeting in the Lord Jesus Christ amen um here we go amen I have a scripture here that I'm gonna read some Isaiah 6 he says in the year that the King Josiah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple about it Steward the seraphims each one had six wings with twine he covered his face and with twine he covered his feet and with trying he did fly in one cry unto another and said holy holy holy is the law of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory Kimberly that verse together verse number three one two three in one cry and to another and say holy holy holy is the Lord hosts the whole here is full of his glory let's do it again just one verse and one two three and one cry and to another and said holy holy holy is the law of host the whole earth is full of his glory amen I'm gonna just pray again Almighty Glory I want to give you thanks I need to ask you Lord to use me you were able to use a donkey to speak to a man to save his life Lord I want to ask you to please use me to speak to your children thank you for everything in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen you can have your seat amen um they're going back there um I was quite shocked when I went this is a well-known scripture but I think it's quite amazing how the Lord inspired Isaiah to to write this because the Lord has many attributes but the one that he really make him show to be there is that he was holy and not only once he was holy holy holy he is a holy king amen amen so I want to talk today about who's influencing you this is um this sermon actually was of course was preached by Brother Branham he is an inspiration day but I'm gonna speak like in a different way I can't speak like that um also for the kids I have like a little bit of trivia I'm gonna give the answer so you're gonna have to answer now and he said how many times did they Israelites March around Jericho before it fell one time seven thirteen or nine times we're gonna do it later seven amen so I want to speak to to the young ones so I'm pretty sure that pretty much everyone that is here well no the parents but they are adolescents in adolescent is a word that means a young person in the process of developing from a child into an adult between 10 and 19 years um is where they start experimenting physical cognitive and psychosocial development yeah in that picture you can see the brain of a person with five years old the red you can see the square that's mean their color red means that that's not a material brain he is still developing something there then as uh he's growing you can see the change in the color that means that his brain is maturing in that square it's showing something that's called the executive functions in in that little square you can put all those things together with a impulsive control organization task initiation planning and prodigizing self-monitoring work memory flexible thinking and yeah it goes again so a person that is a young person his brain is not fully developed so he's drawing he's looking what the other people do he can get really influenced yeah because he doesn't have a personality yet and I can say like um when I was young when I was a teenager my mom used to say that uh I was like a dog because if I were not barking I was biting someone I was just horrible I'm really happy that the Lord changed me amen that's how some of the young ones are it's just there's so many hormones going on and they're developing um all those uh functions so just going back to the to the scripture we're going to talk about the king we call him OCS okay so this King actually he was a good King it was very good she was in charge of the Southern Kingdom of Judah you know after the after King Solomon died the kingdom was divided into North and South he was in charge of the South part um while he was in charge he experimented military greatness and victories wealth and his people really love him he was a really good man but um yeah well this King here we have another picture I brought him a picture for the kids and for me too so if you can see the face of the king he's angry in the priests that they are the side they are trying to stop him to do something so um in the story tale that he wanted to offer incense in the temple and when I was reading the thing it's like it wasn't that bad he was trying to do something good you know but that was something that only the priest was ordered by God to do so in his mind he thought man I'm a king I'm doing super good so I'm something something more I can do something that I'm not allowed to do so he really thought that he was something amen so after a couple of minutes there when the priest they told him to please stop he got angry and the lord gave him a mark in the in his forehead was a leprosy I I really think that the lord gave him leprosy in his forehead was because he had really bad thought and we know that the leprosy means sin right so there was something wrong in his mind so the Lord marked him and after that of course if you have leprosy back in those days you will Cast Away you you will not will receive anymore you were unclean you were you were filthy so this King he died and his people love him so when he died there was like um morning we were mourning upon the people everyone was there even Isaiah so we're going to go here so I was trying to research about the like the connection that Isaiah and no use I'm gonna call him his names in Spanish so in some places you can find that they were usia was his ankle in other places that you can find that they were framed but sure thing that they were really they were friends in some places you can find that they used to go to the temple to pray so this the Isaiah was younger than him so of course he was looking up to that man he was a good man so when he died all the people were said and Isaiah he was a prophet of God but that was not all there was something more I think the because he was influenced by that King the Lord couldn't totally use him so when that King died he saw a mighty vision of the Lord that's the scripture that we just read he wrote in the entire Bible if you see if you read the book of Isaiah it's then time over there from beginning to the end to the millennial Kingdom so there was heaps more in store for him so want to do another question here's who do you admire to the young ones do you have my like the music stars the Hollywood stars famous people rich people talented people if you admire those people I can totally say that their influences the influences of the devil because you can see by the work that they do here in Galatians we can find here said now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation rough strife seditions heresies and Vines made this drunkenness revealing and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in the time past that they which those such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God if you see all these influences or all the famous people in the world these are the works that they do they marry and they remarried and then have the God with someone else and one day they are men one day their woman next day they can be a giraffe or something they can they just change the mind all the time in when I was young I used to because I play guitar I used to admire people from the world that they play the guitar and that really dragged me into what I ended up doing like drugs and whatever everything what I did but I didn't notice because it's so something so subtle isn't you um oh you're gonna listen it's just something you don't realize what are you doing and I was looking at a picture of of me like in 2017 or 19 no less when I was like 20 years leather jacket long hair drinking alcohol that was that was what I was looking you know that kind of people was it oh man these guys are awesome I want to be like them I was totally wrong and then when I Was preparing this I started thinking what well who's influencing me and there's the brothers and sisters over there here they're really good you can see the fruits of the spirit in them in the fruits of the experience they have love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there's no law and I was thinking I really admire Ben I can see all those frozen him but then something spoke to my hand said you are doing exactly what I saw you're doing you're looking the mean but all those fruits are not from Bean those Frozen from the Lord and everyone that you can see the fruit s Lord so young people if you can look up to someone just remember that you have to look up to the Lord not a man amen and um that's something really powerful because if you base you walk with the Lord in a human he he can fail but the Lord's Never Gonna fail amen she just took Iran so how many times okay okay wait one time someone said one time no one seven times heaps of time 13 times eight nine times no one okay well the correct answer it's 13 times he said according to Joshua the walls of Jericho fell after the Israelite March around the city walls once a day for six days and seven times of the seventh day and then you blow their horns so it was 13 times amen it was only a few there at the back that they need the answer amen so what I wanted to talk today was about having a an experience with the Lord an experience with the Lord is something that's going to change you like forever yeah what was night became day and you just change I have sorry I have experience with the Lord and it's not because of I'm a great person he gave me an experience with him that's why I feel so blessed it meant an experience with the lord it's something that no one can take it away even if if you look up on a man and if he fails that's nothing I'm looking the Lord because I met him and that's something that's the best thing that you can have um so I have a quote here saying that's what the Devils try to do all the time burn you up on something make you sicker when you prayed for make you think you you have lost your experience with God he's lying to you the time comes when you have to stand on God's word stand alone but when the time comes stand there there's got to be a time when you have got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith that's the time it's tonight it's today for the young people um I really want to encourage you to pray and to have an experience with the Lord so this is something that I've found on the internet said um your friends influence you choose them wisely your friends the friends you have in your life can impact what you ended up achieving in your life if you have specific career aspiration or a desire to inscript increase your education it's invaluable to ensure they support who you are and what is important to you they don't necessarily need to be on the same life path or hold their same dreams but they need to be a positive support system and bring value to their relationship considering the way you think feel and behave is significantly influenced by your friends it's imperative we choose our friends wisely they are you people and are you most vital assist that's why I really think I really love that song what a friend we find in Jesus if he's your friend you're gonna get all those nice fruits of the spirit you are you're gonna be a good prison I think what's brother being what he was preaching he was saying if you can make the lower thoughts your thoughts man your life it can be so much better if you can do the thing and if you can really ask the lawful experience with him your life can change it can be so much better you don't have to go through all the rubbish of the world you can just do it now yeah yeah amen um have another scripture here I was listening a sermon on Friday while I was working and the Potter he started reading this man there was something in me I was like because I can jump now in the in the parents group because I have a little small daughter and says Deuteronomy 6 said and he's talking about um his Moses after his uh give the Ten Commandments and these words which I command thee these days shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk to them when thou cities in thine house and when thou walketh by the way and where thou lies down and when thou rise it up and thou shalt bind them for a sighing upon their in hand and they shall be as a front front list between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the pose of thy house and on the gates when I was reading when I was listening this man but how do you call that when you have like something like Goosebumps yeah because it's really up to us the parents to pray for our children to really teach them the word and um I really know that you know had the way that the devil attacked he's going to try to give the the father because he's the head of the the family and if he cannot he go for the wife and I saw that in in my parents life he was getting my father okay now my mother sickness you know um depressed that the president because she was alone in the house so all those thoughts all the thoughts if he cannot get the father he's gonna go for the wife and then he's gonna go for the children because as a Naomi was reading the devil is acting like a lion he wants to be alive he's not a lion but he act like a lion and if you see how the lion attack they see like a hear it of animals and they look for the young ones for the old ones and for the sick ones they went there they say Target for him yeah yeah so yeah it's really up to you children to have like a experience with the Lord you can pray if you don't have an experience with the Lord we should pray for that because if the family is all together man the family is an invincible family so just wanted to finish with the question who is influencing you are you gonna keep being influenced by the world or for God there's many many ways to get Influence of Music the things that they watch it's sports or whatever you know all this uh team plays that they are good man I want to be like that guys of your life is just going down downhill so this is everything what I have it was my thought so if if we can stand we can pray if the children if if you want to rise up with your hands because you don't have an experience with the Lord we can pray so let's just stand and pray to the god just leave your hand if you don't have an experience with the Lord because he can give you one almighty God we give you things because you are awesome Lord we want to give you things because you take care for us you're an awesome God lord there are many hands your children's Lord that they want to experience with you we need an experience with you Lord that can change our lives we need a burning bush experience Lord we need a road to Damascus experience Lord we want to ask you Lord to please give experience with you to all these children Lord be with us Lord thank you for all your blessing father in Jesus Christ's name I prayed amen amen glory to God Amen just um let's have the musicians again thank you just uh I need to swipe the mics with probably be into that so if we can just go to Shout to the Lord [Music] my Jesus [Music] all of my day [Music] my comfort my goodness [Music] let everyone [Music] worship to the Lord [Music] the mountains [Music] [Music] Nothing Compares [Music] my Jesus [Music] [Laughter] [Music] the wonders of your mighty [Music] and strengths [Music] never cease [Music] be shot to the Lord [Music] the king of Dance [Music] [Music] [Applause] nothing compares to the promise I have in you amen how true that is nothing compares to the promise we have in him hallelujah amen God bless you all thank you Jimmy my goodness okay let's um praise the Lord thank you musicians I thoroughly enjoyed that I hope you did too I thought man well he's just preached my message and I'll just I'll just quit but you know because I want to speak on this question how's your brain laughs I thought man he's showing development I I I was looking at a picture like that I thought no I'm not going to put that in I guess well because someone else put it in for me but praise the Lord so I want to take part two of who's influencing you and um yeah so God bless you let's just read um Second Timothy 1 7. um I also like to give brother Ben a bouquet you know this man has real faith last uh Tuesday when I think Mario's at her lowest he said he committed her and the baby to the Lord and brothers it's the most powerful thing one of the most powerful weapons is a full committal to God it's Faith bro you're an inspiration to me so God bless you okay really it's yep it's because remember when pressure comes on something's going to come out faith comes out praise the Lord amen to God bless you amen I mean first second Timothy one and seven for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind I mean let's just bow he's in a word of prayer gracious father we're so thankful Lord we can bow our heads in your presence once again we thank you Lord we can uh thank you for that soul-searching message we just heard Lord about who's influencing us Lord I pray father that all of us Lord just be you o God may you grant it Lord bless brother Jimmy for that we appreciated it so much Lord and fathers we just opened your word once again I pray you'll just take it once again Lord anointed to our hearts For Your Glory we love you so much and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seat so um so yes I want to take a part two from what brother Jimmy was saying is is who's influencing you and I want to talk about the effect of influence talking about in the body so um as we've got here um uh the the word A sound mind is actually one word in Greek and it's an admonishing according to soundness of mind to moderation and self-control so that's what it means from the Thea Bible dictionary now what happens is when things affect us in our spirit it affects our body okay so brother Brown brings out a couple of uh you just go through the prayer line You'll see these here many times but I just want to bring two out and all of you that have heart trouble stand to your feet just a moment every person with heart trouble there's too many to call you just can't catch them stand here for a moment sister come our sister suffers with the stomach trouble caused from nervousness so she had a physical problem because of a spiritual problem and and and you'll see this at many times that's that that the devil will attack our spirit and will begin to affect our body it'll manifest physically so things that are spiritual manifest physically and he says here now yes you're suffering with a high blood pressure that's right caused from a nervous condition so there's there's trouble in the world today and it and it and it's your nervousness we know we live in a very nervous age we live in a very fast pace age very complex neurotic age and but we see that you know uh spiritual things manifest physically so notice he didn't say you just have high blood pressure because of high cholesterol or whatever it is no it's from a nervous condition so we need to look at what I want to look at actually is the effect of um the internet on our lives now remember every this is a tool there's nothing wrong with this there's nothing wrong with this there's nothing wrong with that it's how you use it right so so there's nothing wrong with these things but but how do we use them and how do they affect us this is what we want to go into because this is very important and this actually covers every age so not just young people but but old people and and in between people those young at heart people and so um I'm sorry I just have this here so so so here's a take-home thought let technology be a tool for you don't be a tool of Technology because we live in a consumer age right and and what happens is that that you know anything that is popular today there's a science behind it why it's popular it's not popular because of a stab in the dark wow how did this thing go organically grow you know even even you look at McDonald's and like the the the discomfort of the seat the color of the room everything in that everything in the restaurant not even so we're not even talking about the food yet is engineered because they want to turn people over at a certain rate to earn a certain amount of money okay and then of course with the food they've engineered that to be very addictive to all ages because imagine if McDonald's was um organic free range Whole Food you think your kids would be I want to go to McDonald's no that that Chain's gone you know why because it's not addictive it's good for you I mean if it was that way it'd be good for you but you see what happens is is is very powerful uh very very popular things are addictive and there's been a manipulation of the human mind and body for it to be addictive so this is what we're going to go into now um who knows we're gonna have a science lesson today some people oh man Sunday afternoon anyway who knows what this chemical is does anyone know what this chemical is anyone doing anyone want to guess uh yes Malachi no it's not water but it floats in water we're 70 opposite water do you know you're a bag of water walking around with a life and anyway this is called dopamine so we're going to talk about brain chemistry today so dopamine is a pleasure chemical that is released in your brain now what happens is is especially I'm going to talk about the internet in specific but isn't anything when you eat McDonald's it produces dopamine your body is being told I like this a lot that's why you go back for more and if you could again you know this is why you beat you if you could you'd be through the drive through every day because your brain is producing dopamine and this is in everything you enjoy even if you love the presence of the Lord which I pray you all do your body will be producing dopamine in the brain I like this this is good this is awesome on the amen it's because it's a pleasure chemical right but you see Silicon Valley which I'm just encompassing all social media in the internet I'm just all of them are just a one big lump they've exploited this chemical Coca-Cola any any popular brand known to man has exploited this chemical this is from this is from a newspaper called The Guardian this from 2018 an article says Silicon Valley is Keen to exploit the brain chemical creative with keeping us tapping on apps and social media in an unprecedented attack of of Candor which is honesty Sean Parker the 38 year old founding president of Facebook recently admitted that the social network was founded not to unite us but to distract us the thought now I read this I'm thinking I'm still on Facebook am I going to get off Facebook because of this probably not because it's a tool it's very easy just to scroll all day I'm throwing myself in this too I've realized after this man I'm on my phone way too much see not to unite us but to distract us the thought process was how can we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible that's the thrust he said in an event in Philadelphia in November to achieve this goal Facebook's architect exploited a vulnerability in human psychology explained Parker who resigned from the company in 2005 whenever someone likes or comments on a post or photograph he said we give you a little dopamine hit so produces that you get a like you see a photo you see a video you like it's producing dopamine in your brain so we've built a little we give you a little dopamine hit Facebook as an Empire of Empires then built upon a molecule so it is popular because it exploits this see the devil knows our bodies too he knows how to exploit human vulnerabilities against us now as I said does that mean I'm going to get off Facebook no I'm going to stay on Facebook but is it something where I just actually just get my daily fix or is it at all see don't let don't be let let the in let technology be your tool don't be a tool for it okay because they want to keep your attention because they make money off of you and your data now this is now you just think about this this I just Googled this top 21 social networking sites 2023 and this is your the first few so an Mau because I'm like what's an Mau it's a monthly active user so this is a number of active users on these platforms okay so Facebook has 296 billion ma use that is so the world population is about 8 billion people that's a lot of people on One platform that's a lot of people scrolling that's a lot of people liking a lot of people commenting a lot of people posting that's a lot of people a month they YouTubers 2.2 billion WhatsApp two billion Instagram two WeChat 1.26 billion Tick Tock is one billion and um the other one is 573 million that's a lot of people a but the reason that people are on it is because it's addictive see what what's influencing you as we heard now how's it influencing you because all this changes your brain chemistry it's not just a thing that doesn't it's like you eat a Big Mac the first one may be good the next one just carrying around with you for a bit longer and then you get older you carry it for longer right it goes here and for me it goes here okay so if you take that just your body like that then how much more your brain because what happens is technology rewires our brains especially in adolescence as we as brother Jimmy showed the development right of the brain so now what this causes is a so this exploits also so especially in young people this this exploits chemistry in the brain now what happens is you know our brain as we saw it's not fully developed when we're when we're a baby right it's when you're about 20 you're you're you're there maybe for me 26. I get there eventually but what happens is the more dopamine you produce they actually so so you can produce a lot of it but then actually the body begins to produce less of it so something is very addictive you really begin to enjoy it but then you need a greater hit of it to produce that same feeling in your body so this produces a real lethargic person and so you've got to keep that in mind when we talk about these things because what happens especially in a young brain is it begins to rewire your brain now we're gonna I'm gonna show you a video soon I hope you don't fall asleep in it because it's a science video but I'm just going to show you these things first okay so now I don't know if you can see this but this is a this is a um a diagram of a connection between two uh basically two neurons in in a brain has you ever seen a picture I was going to show you a literal picture of a brain but I thought no I won't show you that you know someone's brain anyway so what happens is it's actually a transfer of chemicals causes transmission between your brain now dopamine you see here you see these here so neurotrasmatic molecules one of them is dopamine so your body will produce a lot of it when it's enjoying something and then it will produce and then it will send a chemical signal and then you'll feel happy or whatever more but then the more you have that head of that thing your body will produce less and what actually that causes is a lack of a a lack of empathy in that person so the more technology the more addiction we have the greater the drop of empathy between one another now when you're when your brain is first um so so there's all these connections like this now your brain actually rewires itself when you go through adolescence so this is now us now this is a diagram I don't know if you can see it very well but your brain is full of synapses which are these connections that we just saw like this right and your so so from 36 weeks so this is I don't know how they've got these pictures but this is a braid at 36 weeks not many connections right and in a newborns like this and then you see as you go along there's heaps more connections made but then notice now from four to six years is actually a decrease so it actually comes a point where you have all these connections and then what happens is in your body just you know around this time and then and then as you go along there's a lot of these um synapses here actually get cut away there's and it's called you either use it or you lose it so your brain builds all these pathways and then the ones you use the brain says we need this we're going to keep it we don't use that one we're going to get rid of it so if you're addicted to a certain thing like your hit is is technology or whatever then your brain will keep that connection and the other ones you don't use it'll be cut away and and this happens at a great rate after six years old and it begins to Plateau then but then slowly as you age you lose these synapses slowly but then it's amazing because between the ages of 10 to 13 is there's a big drop of this other chemical which actually takes away all the chicken balance in your brain so before you hit puberty there's a balance of chicken balancing a child's brain is this a good I want to do this is this a good idea no okay but then when you get to older into puberty the the check or the balance goes real small so the I'm going to do this crazy thing and before and I was like yeah that's crazy let's not do it but now it's I'm going to do this thing and this little voice says that's crazy well I can't hear you that's a crazy thing who's had kids that you know you think man they're just playing something that's like whoa what are they doing it's because their brain is developing nothing wrong with the child it's just their brain is developing you see so but then what happens around that time around 10 years old many many parents think well my child's 10 I can trust them so they pass them a smartphone then it opens a whole Gateway to a world of Crazy Town because if you look at any if you look at any search and I don't recommend it you'll start with something wholesome you'll end up in crazy because the devil wants you to go to crazy but the thing is people should be naturally be curious you should want to know what is the world what what's you know what's going on what you know what's happening to me all these things it's natural to have a curiosity but then it's up to us as parents to guide that Curiosity okay so now this causes so so this is synapse pruning okay now I've talked about that so you've got to be careful how your brain now your brain can get rewired right but you've got to be we must be careful that we don't just get addicted to anything and our brain's only wired that way just like I was saying about how the people have high blood pressure because the nervousness is anything else because you know so a spirit got you know something affected their spirit and their wired their body a certain way high blood pressure different things see so that so is manifesting what was spiritually going on and it's the same thing when we when we're on anything right spiritually it will affect us but then physically it will affect it'll be manifested who's with me so far right this is probably all of the biology you ever want in your life but you know so there's a physiology physiological effect from these things now dopamine I'm just going to go this demo that I may be put on the video now does dopamine affect empathy this is what this is what we were told now does so how dopamine drives human behavior healthy levels of dopamine can also make us more social and extroverted this feel-good neurotransmitter also helps increase our empathy for others make us more willing to adapt to others needs dopamine can also stimulate creativity so if you have if you have a low level of dopamine because of addiction you are less empathetic less yeah you have less empathy you're less creative and you're more introverted now I haven't put this up but everyone should I mean this is extreme cases but and I know I've said it before but there's a whole group of young men in Japan called the hikomori over a hundred thousand of them that live in their rooms and their parents place they never go out they're addicted to online world it's a it's a it's an epidemic or a pandemic or whatever it is bad in that country because these these young men that should be living to their full potential and I think it's even women too but they're locked in this little world and they don't know how to get out of it and because they've been because they've trained their bodies unfortunately to live off the stuff but you see that may be an extreme case but we don't ever want to we don't ever want to get caught up in an addiction that makes us anti-social you know the reason people uh I've heard there's been studies done that addiction happens because of a lack of connection that's actually the major cause of addiction a lack of connection to other people what is technology addiction Google tells me technology addiction also called internet addiction or internet use disorder among other names is a broad term used to describe any obsessive Tech related behavior that can be gaming online shopping social media use video watching or any anything else involving digital technology now all of those things can be good gaming can help reflexes I'm not advocating gaming but you know there's all good online shopping all the scissors you say praise God it's a good thing you know social media use you can talk and video whatever you're video watching YouTube you know all you know there's good things right but when it becomes an addiction that is the problem right and in the causes so addiction to screens generally develops when the subject seeks to divert its attention from discomfort so it's looking for a place of safety amen it can't find Comfort oh well Mom doesn't understand me dad doesn't understand me I don't understand me this person doesn't so I need to find I need a safe place well the Lord is our place that we can find Comfort we can find rest we can be ourselves in his presence amen see to divert its attention from discomfort boredom sleep sleeplessness lack of purpose or even social isolation can be triggers boredom's a good thing it actually should stimulate creativity oh yes I'm getting a head shake right there boredom is a good thing how many no okay we went to a talk at school where they talked about these things but you know how many of us endured boring road trips as kids are you alive did you survive it well you know it's good to be bored some of the greatest discoveries in the world known to man is because of boredom people are going to think and experiment do things play things you know how do you think a lot of games were invented get outside and play well what are we going to do well there's a ball okay next minute we have an international game they all started somewhere you know FIFA didn't turn up and say Let There Be soccer and now there's soccer no it evolved it evolved from something it evolved away from kids being bored kicking around a I don't know something how did rugby start you know all these things nothing wrong with the game don't let it be your God but you know what I mean boredom is actually you know Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and threw an apple fall then he wrote the laws of motion because he was a genius gravitational Laws of Motion but things you're sitting under a tree watching an Apple for yeah you know he began to understand the world because he saw an apple fall what is oh he's probably bought at the time just sitting there lovely you know then this thud then it sparked something in his life how much more you and I meditate on the word maybe I was having a boring day you think on a scripture a song comes to mind boom in the whole world of God just opens up and everything amen now who we are online should be the same as we are in real life we don't have an online Persona and a real life Persona we should have the same thing amen we shouldn't be different kind of people you know there's a lot of things I think we need as families because because every family is Sovereign but you need to have a discussion you should have a government policy on device use you should because you know children children in Intermediate School they share newts boys collect them like Pokemon cards and of course that Lee and there's a lot of pressure on girls to share notes Intermediate School there's a lot of pressure on that that also leads to Blackmail then they share more then they're trapped we shouldn't be trapped by anything even if you've done those things you'll be able to talk to your parents because they can have even just a confession exposure will actually unlock you from that thing you know at least a black male boys trade them um you know like Snapchat what is Snapchat I mean to me Tick Tock is Crazy Town you've got to be careful what you're looking at you have to know before the Lord well that's a cool video but then what about the one after that you can't unsee that's on there even YouTube can be crazy town Google image search crazy a town you've got to be Lord guide me in these things because when you after you see something you can't unsee it and it's not a lot of things are not worth seeing yep amen there's a lot of things like that so we've got to be very diligent about these things because the devil wants to Mark us with a thing doesn't mean we cannot be free of it right but why go through the drama of the whole thing where you just bypass the whole trial amen I'll say about pornography one it's evil it is a it is a person right as people but don't let that ever become your normal of what love really is you shouldn't be watching it in the first place but don't let that be a normal that's not normal so don't but the thing is the world is conditioning children and my age to say that's normal that's not normal that is someone that someone's daughter someone's mother someone sister someone's brother whatever on there don't look at it it's not worth it okay yes it is very evil that's what the devil's done but don't be don't be trapped by these things but it produces this we shouldn't be a slave to these things remember they want to consume as much as your time and conscious attention as possible in the in the yellow in the middle um where are we now synapse uh it's called synapse pruning do we have oh wait maybe I can put that on can I put that on who wants a science video this is maturation and human brain starts its development in early embryonic stage and reaches the maximum number of synaptic connections sometime in early childhood at which point it is about double of what is normally present in an adult brain this is when the elimination of excess neuronal synapses known as synaptic pruning begins the process removes roughly half of all synapses and occurs mainly during adolescence but may continue well into young adulthood by getting rid of unnecessary connections synaptic pruning helps to refine neural circuits and increase Network efficiency computational models suggest that learning performance is optimal when synaptic connections are first over generated and then pruned an analogy is the task of writing an essay the easiest way is to put all possible ideas into a longer than needed first draft then trim it to keep only the essential points to create an effective final message synaptic pruning is activity driven and follows the use it or lose it rule synapses that are rarely used are eliminated while frequently used synapses are protected from removal in fact it has been shown that activation of the glutamate receptor nmda a marker associated with long-term memory retention and learning is the major protective factor for a synapse thus active synapses are selectively stabilized while Superfluous synapses are eliminated while the mechanism underlying synaptic pruning is in most part still a mystery recent Studies have implicated the brain's supportive cells known as glial cells or glia specifically two types of glia astrocytes and microglia are responsible for identifying and removing unnecessary neural connections a number of signaling molecules are involved in control of glial cell movement Target recognition and ingestion given the important role of synaptic pruning in sculpturing and refining the brain's neural circuits it is plausible that aberrant synaptic pruning is associated with a number of neurological disorders such as schizophrenia autism and epilepsy too much pruning results in shortage of connections and is thought to underlie schizophrenia the first occurrence of schizophrenia symptoms typically in late adolescents or early adulthood coincides with the time when synaptic pruning is most prominent too little pruning on the other hand leaves the brain with too many redundant connections which can be confusing inefficient and may limit learning potential excessive synapses are observed in autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy okay everyone got that use it or lose it don't be so addicted to one thing that your branches hardwired that way okay have a well-balanced life okay don't don't become a don't become an uh just someone who's a hermit and lives online you'll find the reason people are so there's so much mental illness is because people are less connected than ever before in this day even though we may be connected to hundreds and thousands of people all around the world on the internet but the relationship's not the same as person to person right so if you ever feel see a a big wait if I've got this here to show you've got to think about what if I've got this if you if you're addicted to something then you'll find yourself lethargic and not having no drive to do other things so if you're always driven to go on here and you're lethargic to just you don't have any you know to to connect with your family or connect with people in the real world and you say Lord help me because you know that that actually get enjoyment out of real life because we're here to live real life hey we shouldn't be living just an online as I said there's nothing wrong with this there's nothing wrong with this there's nothing wrong with computers but it's how we use them now as I was talking about here where I'm just going to wrap this up we live in a nervous neurotic age remember people get addicted to things because it diverts their attention from discomfort and this is an age where we build up pressure it's a high pressure h but we can lead off the pressure we can let off the pressure we can let God rewire our brains but remember it starts it's got to start with us actually doing something isn't it amazing how when we saw in that video there's that synaptic pruning all these different molecules and enzymes come together and start trimming but it all starts but but why does that happen because of choices right and you say well you may not feel like doing something different but if you begin to do it then your brain will rewire itself again in the right way okay now in a time of sickness when sickness strikes and doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it so this is a discomfort right don't build up pressure lead off the pressure call your past let them anoint you in all the prayer over you the prayer face shall save the sick let off the pressure see he's our refuge while you're in this Refuge you've got to write to anything that's in the Refuge and Christ is our refuge and everything we have need of is in him amen and sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure you say well I wonder brother Branham you don't have to wonder you just you just let off the pressure just let the pressure off commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up pressure it lets off pressure well you say I'm so worried brother Graham I just don't know let off the pressure amen and the City of Refuge he took your worry so you don't have to have it um cast your cares on him for he cares for you don't you worry about your cares that's his business right so don't don't don't go to anything to to to cure your discomfort apart from the Lord sure God is in everything I mean a lot of things right and we should we should have Fellowship one with another be connected to our family but our alternate our ultimate Comfort should be in the Lord himself I trust this is making sense Amen to the Bible says here I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body is a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service oh we're still there good and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is uh what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so if you're addicted to this I think to be honest I'm addicted to this I need the Lord to help me I'll be honest I'm on it too much I want my mind to be renewed amen so how's your brain I trust is good if not you say Lord help me help me change my behaviors and what I'm doing because really if you think about it how beneficial was it for scrolling for an hour did you really need to read that article did you really need to watch that video did you really no did you really what benefit has it given to your life probably not a you know so just think about that BC they want you as connected as possible amen so let's let's have the musicians this afternoon I see it's four o'clock sorry thank you for letting me take your time amen let's just um yeah let's just stand and brother kid I'm just going to pray and then I'll now then I'll pass the service over to you so so I enjoyed that brother Jimmy amen who's influencing you and then I could say part two what's the effect of the influence is it making you more like the Lord is it making you more connected to your family to your spouse to your friends to Brothers and Sisters in Christ you know is it making you more connected or is it actually lowering your empathy and making you withdrawal so I trust our influence today is the Lord himself amen so let's balance and we'll pray that I'll turn the service over to you bro I mean let's pray together gracious Lord Jesus we love you so much dear God please Lord I pray father you touch your hearts Lord touch our minds o god father if we have gone off Lord I feel I'm guilty of it Lord of being addicted to to the internet Lord uh to social media to the news to different things Lord that really the vast majority of it doesn't profit me none so I pray Lord God you'd forgive me Lord Jesus and I pray Lord you you'd renew my mind father anyone else here Lord Jesus it needs a touch from you o God Father's become addicted to to to anything father that's Lord that Lord that Lord that's walled them up in a prison somewhere oh God that they've got to be online or somewhere else and they're disconnected from reality Lord I pray you touch them too oh god father I pray would be like Isaiah and the temple oh Lord we have a visitation from you Lord Jesus Lord Uzziah had to die that that that that that influence had to go because we know Isaiah the prophet seen too much on the king but Lord you had to reveal yourself to Isaiah you had to write a Bible through him oh God and Lord I believe you you want to write the Bible through our lives oh God not not pen and paper necessarily like Isaiah but but a living Bible Lord that your word would put on flesh in our lives o God that father all 66 books would be manifested in our lives oh god father of your character of Your Love Lord of all that you are so I pray you grant it dear God pray you'd wash us in your blood Lord we love you we just commit ourselves Lord into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends Amen brother God bless you bro amen amen God bless you brother Ben thank you for that um if we could just sing Jesus be the center [Music] be the same be my life oh Jesus [Music] [Applause] things [Music] Jesus [Music] in yourself be the reasons Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Jesus [Music] any sense [Music] [Applause] Jesus be my vision be my boss be my God Jesus thank you Jesus [Music] be my God be my God thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] happy birthday [Music] [Music] every year [Music] foreign [Music] pictures for you boys yes baby glad I will rejoice [Music] [Applause] [Music] baby glad I will rejoice foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
