[5:25] to atmospheres you know and and the Lord
[5:28] has a mind he has a desire here there's
[5:30] a there's something the Lord's doing and
[5:32] and you know if you get to church a bit
[5:33] earlier you can kind of have a chance to
[5:36] sort of catch that atmosphere that's
[5:38] kind of why I like to go early not not
[5:39] to show that I'm here early but you know

[31:54] that um I want you to not this is a
[31:58] little bit more of a teaching one it's
[31:59] not going to be so so much a preaching
[32:01] one so I've put a lot of slides together
[32:03] I want you to follow with me in the
[32:04] slides if you can keep your Bibles open
[32:06] it would be fantastic as well because we
[32:08] might do a little bit of jumping through
[32:10] the scriptures we might not we just ask
[32:12] what the Lord will do for us tonight but
[32:14] our open opening scripture is Romans 8
[32:18] 38 and 39 who knows
[32:21] this okay let's read it for I am
[32:25] persuaded that neither death nor life
[32:27] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[32:30] nor things present nor things to come
[32:33] nor height nor death nor any other
[32:36] creature shall be able to separate us
[32:39] from the love of God which is in Christ
[32:42] Jesus our lord amen amen amen let's just
[32:46] pray there Lord Jesus we have opened
[32:48] your word father but now we ask you as
[32:51] the author of the word Lord the word
[32:53] himself to step in right now and Lord
[32:55] may you just bless this evening Lord and
[32:57] May may it be just edifying for the body
[32:59] of Christ in the name of our Lord Jesus
[33:01] Christ amen you may have your seats like
[33:05] brother M says while I remain
[33:07] [Laughter]
[33:10] standing I don't think I'll wander
[33:12] around too much tonight I'll try to stay
[33:14] by the the this or else it's just going
[33:17] to blow out way too long um I just want
[33:20] to do something here before I go there
[33:29] okay that's why I got the clicker
[33:30] brother or else it's just too many
[33:31] devices to do I've got to F man I'm
[33:33] going to switch this off is it going to
[33:35] confuse me what's the time 8:00 so
[33:37] hopefully by 9:00 we're out of here
[33:39] latest he okay just pray with me stay
[33:42] with me a quicker we do this the better
[33:45] okay so my question was why did God save
[33:50] me when I was still you young people
[33:52] this is a little bit more for you
[33:53] tonight so if you can stay in here and
[33:55] not fall asleep I promise you you'll get
[33:56] a blessing out of this
[33:58] young people old people if you fall
[34:00] asleep I understand anybody over 40 I
[34:02] feel you okay but I don't think it will
[34:05] be too boring and we got a lot of slides
[34:07] if you feel you're wandering off come
[34:08] back just come back okay don't don't
[34:11] wander off just come back whatever you
[34:13] do stay in the service it is for for you
[34:17] I've already been corrected I thank you
[34:19] for this and I've been blessed now this
[34:21] one is for you so you pull okay am man
[34:24] cuz when you R these things the Lord
[34:26] Cuts both ways hey thinking oh Lord
[34:28] forgive me so let's start it this way um
[34:32] I asked the Lord I said Lord when I was
[34:35] lost and I was in the world completely
[34:38] out of the economy of God if I had to
[34:40] die in that state I would have gone
[34:42] straight to hell and I find myself a lot
[34:45] when I read the word of God saying Lord
[34:47] but why
[34:49] me but the one scripture and it is just
[34:51] something that a skid that Ed and I did
[34:53] way back in the day we we owe you guys a
[34:57] couple of skids well we did that and and
[34:59] one thing that realized is Brother Steve
[35:03] prison preached so nicely on it he said
[35:05] your
[35:06] origin you come from God hallelujah you
[35:09] go back to God God cannot lose a part of
[35:12] himself now I don't want to go on with
[35:13] this but I just want to realize this
[35:15] sets how you walk he said and it and it
[35:18] really impacted me if you think it's for
[35:20] knowledge and you just made the right
[35:22] choice then it was you making the choice
[35:24] but see don't miss this this is not you
[35:27] choosing God this is God choosing you it
[35:30] was never your choice it was just his
[35:33] time you think it's your time but it's
[35:36] his time so as long as we remember where
[35:39] you're coming from that's origin so you
[35:43] are just as much part of God than God is
[35:46] part of you you are you can't take this
[35:49] shirt and cut off the sleeve and throw
[35:51] it away and then when I bring the sleeve
[35:53] back it's still part of this jacket it
[35:55] was designed to be a part of it God
[35:58] chose you because you were bed out of
[36:00] him I'm not going to go too much with
[36:02] that but your origin you are a part of
[36:06] God and because you came from God you
[36:08] have to go back to God and then God said
[36:10] to me he says but you were lost yeah but
[36:13] were you really lost you just had
[36:16] Amnesia you were just busy with your
[36:19] stuff like teenagers man they can get
[36:21] busy with their stuff leave ow I got I
[36:25] got two boys growing up very fastly and
[36:27] re
[36:28] man it it's quick before you know it
[36:30] they're looking at you and you're
[36:32] talking to them and they're like 50 mil
[36:34] gone you're like where did the young boy
[36:35] go that was like yes daddy yes he's gone
[36:39] he's now a young man staring you back
[36:40] with his own opinion so that's what
[36:43] happened with us when we when we went
[36:45] into the world and we were burn birthed
[36:47] in sin there was like this Amnesia
[36:49] between us and God but see God said
[36:52] nothing can separate you from me yeah
[36:55] from the love of God huj
[36:58] so I want to follow you so John 3:16
[37:01] Says for God so loved the world that he
[37:03] gave his only begotten son whosoever
[37:04] believe in him shall not perish and have
[37:06] everlasting life so God himself loved
[37:09] the world Amen so I want you to get the
[37:11] theme for tonight the the the sermon
[37:13] title is When Love is
[37:16] projected When Love is projected so not
[37:20] you get two types of love and we're
[37:21] going to quickly go through it don't
[37:23] don't lose me now stay with
[37:25] me I'm going to I'll call out names if
[37:27] you fall asleep trust me
[37:29] tonight I ain't scared you talk to your
[37:32] mom and dad after that I want you to
[37:34] realize is there's two types of love
[37:37] there's agapo love and there's filio
[37:40] love and brother Brandon brings this
[37:42] very nicely together he says now love is
[37:45] two different
[37:46] words two different meanings in the
[37:49] Greek one of them is called filio that
[37:51] is the love that you have for your wife
[37:54] now boy I do love my wife a lot
[37:57] and I think man I'll take a bullet for
[37:59] my wife I will do anything for my life I
[38:02] I'll die for my wife but he says that
[38:04] love is still just feel your
[38:07] love that is not the love of God and he
[38:09] goes on here and he says now the love
[38:11] that you have for your wife and the love
[38:14] that you have the love of God Is So
[38:17] contrary so just listen to this the love
[38:20] that you have for your wife if a man
[38:22] would insult her you would kill him on
[38:24] the spot it's a bit drastic
[38:27] might you would at least sock him one
[38:30] you know you would because now look you
[38:33] love your wife so I'm going to stand in
[38:34] the gap for my wife he says but it's
[38:37] different he says but that is that kind
[38:41] of love a filal love but with a gap of
[38:44] love you would pray for his lost
[38:50] soul so when we when we love someone
[38:55] that don't mean it's a true love
[38:57] look I love all of
[38:59] you but love sometimes is paper
[39:04] thin but see God wants us to move on
[39:06] from that love to his agapo love so that
[39:11] love and I won't leave it the notes now
[39:13] he says but one poet wrote it like this
[39:16] he says if every stalk on Earth was a
[39:18] quill and every man is scribed by trade
[39:20] to write the love of God above would
[39:23] drain the ocean dry that's right we we
[39:25] sing the song we know the song man I was
[39:27] so praying you would sing that song you
[39:29] sing it so good says to write the love
[39:32] of God above would drain the ocean dry
[39:34] or could the scroll contain the whole
[39:36] thought stretch from SC Sky to
[39:39] Sky the depth of God's love is so vast
[39:43] that we as humans cannot understand how
[39:45] much he loved us even when I was walking
[39:47] in sin in the world completely separated
[39:50] from sin not even believing in God I
[39:54] wasn't an atheist I just it was a story
[39:56] in the Bible
[39:58] all the Bible was a story there was no
[40:00] real Revelation or a relationship with
[40:03] God but yet you if you ask me do you
[40:05] love God I say I love God and even if
[40:07] you ask me now i' say I love God I'll
[40:08] say I love God because it's so easy to
[40:10] use the term love now we got some young
[40:14] couples here I'm going to knock on your
[40:15] door soon all of you young
[40:18] couples be careful when you say love
[40:21] because the when you stand in front of
[40:22] the The Altar and you say for better and
[40:25] For Worse you don't say for better and
[40:27] for better say for for richer and richer
[40:30] so better and worse richer and poor okay
[40:33] there there that love is going to go
[40:36] when you think you're at your lowest
[40:37] point then go a bit further that love
[40:41] Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about
[40:43] we'll just go on with this so brother
[40:46] brandham uses a little bit of there and
[40:48] this is why you please follow me on the
[40:50] slides he says there and now there's
[40:52] many times people misjudge one another
[40:56] and this is a bad thing to do you say
[40:58] why she's got short hair she's wearing
[41:01] her dress too short that that's not the
[41:04] Holy Ghost upon
[41:06] her how many people has done this or
[41:09] guilty of
[41:11] this cuz remember love is paper thin and
[41:14] love is also if it's in a f your realm
[41:17] it's very easy to lose it because it's F
[41:20] Your Love he says don't do that don't do
[41:23] that that's not right you know you don't
[41:27] know what's in that woman's heart you
[41:29] don't know nothing about it you don't
[41:31] know the Holy Spirit would make her
[41:33] conduct herself a little better now that
[41:36] may be true but I'll tell you you as you
[41:40] and I let's let God do the judging of
[41:44] that and let you and I just pray for
[41:47] that person that God will show them the
[41:50] light that's different
[41:53] love you know I'm not going to preach
[41:56] too much or off the subject but it's
[41:58] easy to look at someone else's child
[42:01] it's easy to look at someone else's wife
[42:03] brother sister anybody in church and
[42:05] quickly judge that ain't love brother
[42:09] brandom says please don't do that
[42:11] because when you start doing it it it it
[42:14] breaks that Godly love in the church it
[42:17] breaks that that Holy Spirit and and
[42:21] let's just go on I'll get there next one
[42:24] I want you to follow me this is this is
[42:26] really important here sometime ago a man
[42:30] called me out there aside and I had a
[42:33] Pianist there they had a little short
[42:36] little skirt it wasn't exactly I guess
[42:39] just right and the lady had short hair
[42:42] and she was just a babe in this
[42:45] way so I remember when sister Chantel
[42:49] and I came to the church and she showed
[42:51] up in the jeans you know and I showed up
[42:55] my B Shoes which was my jandals
[42:57] you know but we showed up and the one
[43:01] thing about a Healing Ministry which I
[43:03] believe we are
[43:04] under um is people never came to us and
[43:09] and gave us the legalistic side of the
[43:12] message I I had no one come to me and
[43:15] say shape up and start wearing our tie
[43:18] and start looking a certain way and
[43:19] dress was the prophet now we had none of
[43:21] that we had Divine love projected I want
[43:26] us to remember where we come from the
[43:28] the prophecy over the church was if we
[43:30] can stay
[43:31] humble God will add Souls that was
[43:34] finding him will'll add him to this
[43:36] church but we must stay humble but
[43:38] humble is not always you being low and
[43:41] somebody being high it's really loving
[43:44] them with the love of Christ Hallelujah
[43:47] and so we didn't maybe looked theart we
[43:49] were still babes we didn't know anything
[43:51] about the seals we didn't know about
[43:53] brother brandom we didn't understand the
[43:55] events that happened the word being open
[43:58] but we
[43:59] came as many of us still coming to
[44:01] church no matter if they grew up in the
[44:03] message or not and they might not look
[44:06] the same as you don't worry about them
[44:08] because you can't see what God's doing
[44:11] in their heart Hallelujah you can't it's
[44:14] not your job that's God's job you leave
[44:16] that alone you project
[44:19] love okay we'll go on with it he says
[44:22] and she was playing the piano so she was
[44:24] in a a Ministry she was in a gift she
[44:26] had a gift and God was using the gift
[44:29] but gifts and calling is without
[44:31] repentance so it's still a gift and God
[44:33] God's still using it like bam that was a
[44:35] prophet he was still a false prophet but
[44:38] God still prophesied true through him
[44:40] because God's word cannot fail he still
[44:42] had the gift of Prophecy so what he
[44:44] wanted to sell it out for that's between
[44:46] him and God and and what's the motive
[44:48] Behind The Pianist playing here and
[44:50] brother bram's church that motive is
[44:53] between her and God and the guy playing
[44:54] the drums and the guy playing the bass
[44:56] the the the the reason he's here that's
[44:58] between him and God don't you judge
[45:00] anything about that God will sort him
[45:02] out he's big he can do it he brings me
[45:06] in he can bring you in he can bring him
[45:08] in he can bring her in don't you worry
[45:10] about it don't run God's business you
[45:12] you make it all mixed up it makes it
[45:14] really hard there's gifts for that and
[45:16] offices for that he says and the man met
[45:20] me out there and he was tearing me to
[45:22] pieces and said and you're Pentecostal
[45:25] preacher now look how it happened
[45:27] happens brother Ben you you follow me as
[45:30] well cuz you're not here I would have
[45:32] wanted to look at your face when I said
[45:33] that why is it always the pastor's fault
[45:37] when the church is not in their
[45:39] place because he's not legalistic enough
[45:43] or because he has too much great why is
[45:45] it the pastor's fault why is it not your
[45:50] fault we're a multi-member body we're
[45:54] all in this together we raise the
[45:57] children together but it's it's easy to
[46:00] go it's the teacher's fault it's the
[46:01] pastor's fault is that one that's not
[46:03] what we're talking about here a family
[46:05] says we're responsible for that person
[46:09] absolutely so the the motive behind us
[46:12] is not to push anyone down or say it's
[46:15] whose fault because one thing I do hate
[46:17] and it happens with my boys they always
[46:20] snitch on the other one when they doing
[46:23] wrong so if I pull you into the argument
[46:27] okay then I'm I'm I'm good no you're
[46:31] still wrong pulling your brother into it
[46:33] it's not going to make you less getting
[46:35] a Les par SL you're still wrong correct
[46:38] you all your kids do that hey Mo it was
[46:42] Cara he bumped me first yeah but you
[46:44] socked him in the nose yeah you but you
[46:46] still socked him in the nose you're
[46:47] still going to get a p SL yeah but now
[46:49] I've got Cara in there as well that
[46:51] attitude should not happen in the church
[46:53] because remember it's not if I let
[46:55] someone else look like the sinning then
[46:57] I'm looking not as a sinner this is
[46:59] between you and God it's very personal
[47:02] it's a it's a one-on-one walk Collective
[47:05] body work but one
[47:06] onone yeah even if everybody judges you
[47:09] don't worry God is the final judge he
[47:12] knows what's in your heart correct amen
[47:15] so let's keep it clean so don't don't
[47:17] you refer to your
[47:19] pastor when stuff goes wrong the poor
[47:22] fellow has it already hard enough with
[47:24] all of us man
[47:27] I wish brother B was I was thinking of
[47:29] him when I read this I thought oh boy
[47:31] sorry Lord forgive me you know because
[47:33] we're quick to run to the pastor quick
[47:35] to overload the deacons you know sure
[47:37] they only have that much RAM you
[47:40] know so it this one of them down here is
[47:44] one kind up here so she had a skirt on
[47:46] where they they separated with a belt
[47:48] that's how I read this he says one of
[47:50] them down here and one of them kind of
[47:51] up here and the skirt that they wear and
[47:54] this is just a little bit of background
[47:55] so you understand where brother brandom
[47:56] comes from is real thin and it shows the
[47:59] underneath
[48:00] garment so it ladies sisters I'm a man
[48:06] it's not nice for us to look into your
[48:08] underneath garment okay it's not nice so
[48:10] if you can't do it please don't do it I
[48:13] don't say wear a h sock what is that
[48:15] what is that in
[48:17] English like a bag I don't say just wear
[48:19] a plastic bag over you okay qu suck is
[48:22] like a sheep bag or something like that
[48:24] I don't know what you call it I'm not
[48:26] saying do that but but before you climb
[48:29] out of your house I'm I'm I'm going to
[48:32] tell you now you already look 20 times
[48:34] in the mirror before you left your house
[48:36] so you kind of know which state you're
[48:37] in Ruben does it 15 times you definitely
[48:40] do it 20 times okay so I just want to
[48:43] let you know even as a Young Man checks
[48:45] himself before he goes sisters check
[48:48] yourself before you leave just to make
[48:50] sure that you're not a stumbling block
[48:52] for someone else because your motive
[48:54] coming to church is not to see how
[48:56] beautiful you can look which we all know
[48:58] you beautiful princesses it's you're
[49:00] coming for the
[49:02] Lord your first motive is I'm coming
[49:05] because I love the Lord so if you can do
[49:08] that boy the same with you it's it's
[49:11] your motive coming to church is going to
[49:13] give you the reward what you cast upon
[49:15] the bread you cast upon the water shall
[49:17] return to you so the motive and the way
[49:19] you come is the way you will go but if
[49:22] you come all wrong and like brother
[49:24] Isaac touched on tonight and you just
[49:25] make it and you just just pretty much
[49:27] get into church here on 99 and all those
[49:29] things I'm telling you you are not
[49:31] really expecting something God can still
[49:33] do a lot for you but you're just not in
[49:37] it and I promise you if you go on your
[49:40] first date you ain't just going to dress
[49:42] up all hey hey James hey dress up there
[49:44] in your pluies and your socks over your
[49:47] pants and get there to your first day
[49:49] and go hey how a
[49:50] chick she she won't be a girl for long
[49:54] no you dress up even smells nice when he
[49:56] walks out the door I'm like whoa James
[49:59] huh when he got married the day oh
[50:01] married when he got engaged sorry I
[50:03] married you off already when he got
[50:05] engaged man I looked at him I said bro
[50:08] she knows you're going to get engaged
[50:09] she goes I'm taking my best and he did
[50:13] he looked his best because there was an
[50:16] expectation that today there's going to
[50:18] be a meeting with my wife now God has
[50:20] that same expectation for you and if you
[50:22] have the same expectation for him then
[50:25] two forces will
[50:28] amen so see the don't worry about the
[50:31] preacher and the dress coats and all you
[50:33] worry about God God will sort out the
[50:35] rest but let us not look at them and go
[50:38] oh yeah no he just came in with his pluy
[50:40] so no he's not going to get anything out
[50:41] of the service God is dealing it takes
[50:45] time okay washing by the water of the
[50:49] word okay now he goes on to say
[50:54] there that I skip that why did I one of
[50:58] them down there one kind of disc there
[51:00] and it's real thin and it shows the on
[51:02] the garden and it I don't like that he
[51:05] says I don't like that okay there might
[51:07] be Spirit full f as anybody I don't know
[51:12] God knows but I would not condemn that
[51:14] woman and say that she was going to hell
[51:17] so look at the prophet he's saying I
[51:19] really don't like that that doesn't look
[51:21] for me like Godly but I can't judge you
[51:26] so I ain't going to judge I let God do
[51:28] that that's not our job
[51:31] okay he goes but let me tell you the
[51:33] flip side of this message believing
[51:35] Church okay he says the same person had
[51:38] his church a lady who had long hair and
[51:41] wore a long dress and had a temper
[51:43] enough to fight a buz saw now for you
[51:46] boys I Googled what's a buz saw cuz I
[51:48] thought it was a type of boxer okay
[51:51] there was a guy that was a Boxer that
[51:53] was was somebody buz ER like that swear
[51:57] but no this is a buz saw this looks like
[52:00] one of Ben's machines he would work with
[52:03] now that's the belt that runs it and
[52:06] that's the thing that do does damage so
[52:08] this sister as nice as she's dressed as
[52:11] pied as she looks she looks theart and
[52:14] everything inside her is enough to want
[52:17] to fight a thing like
[52:19] that but she looks the part
[52:23] amen he says and just as me mean as she
[52:27] could be now long hair and long skirts
[52:29] don't take you to heaven no sir it is
[52:31] the spirit that is in you that takes you
[52:34] to heaven so let not forget this Amen
[52:38] brother brandham says he says that when
[52:39] the Holy Spirit comes in it's like a
[52:41] little white
[52:42] dot and as you grow with the Lord and
[52:45] you feed upon the word this Holy Spirit
[52:47] grows and before you can see you don't
[52:50] listen to let zelin Nirvana ACDC
[52:52] Metallica all those type of things your
[52:55] taste changes
[52:57] but no matter how much when I walked
[52:58] into this church you told me that was
[53:00] wrong that was still my
[53:02] taste you could have always said yeah
[53:05] have you tried gospel music that's the
[53:06] love answer you'll go not yet but that's
[53:10] planting some nice seeds but you can't
[53:12] change my taste because it has to come
[53:15] from here it has to be pushed out from
[53:17] the Holy Spirit okay amen let's go on so
[53:22] sisters brothers that that think you're
[53:24] dressed well and you're right in the
[53:25] part and you're your ministry but you
[53:28] get quickly anger angry and want to
[53:30] fight with your brother and show him the
[53:31] right way don't fight The
[53:34] Buzz cuz I'll tell you the next thing
[53:36] that comes he says then you should
[53:39] remember that many times don't mention
[53:42] those things the pastors don't mention
[53:44] those things and they automatically just
[53:46] go on thinking that's all right so if
[53:48] your pastor doesn't preach it what
[53:50] happens we all get
[53:53] lazy but do you want your preacher and
[53:57] your pastor here every Sunday telling
[53:59] you the the law being
[54:01] legalistic getting the deacons to smack
[54:04] you through the door when you come in
[54:05] and you look a bit odd or send you away
[54:08] do you want that kind of Pastor so why
[54:10] do you dress that kind of
[54:12] way see because brother Ben has a
[54:15] Healing Ministry and when he preaches he
[54:18] preaches healing and he will preach
[54:20] these things if he feels he needs to
[54:22] preach it I'm saying why should he even
[54:24] preach it
[54:26] because if we as a body and look now
[54:28] what happens here he says you sisters
[54:30] that's in character it goes on he says
[54:33] and then the sisters of the church the
[54:35] sisters who are in character standing
[54:37] wearing the clothes neatly they should
[54:40] be example of sweetness and motherly and
[54:42] sister likee so he's not just taking and
[54:44] say it's the pastor's fault he says what
[54:46] about the sisters in the church now
[54:48] we're only talking about sisters tonight
[54:50] because the quote says sisters okay but
[54:53] what about the
[54:55] brothers no luckily for you we've got
[54:57] two deacons and they more than capable
[54:59] to sort you guys out but the sisters
[55:02] sometimes get left by the
[55:05] side
[55:10] amen boys are different than woman trust
[55:13] me women needs love they they need a
[55:17] tenderness and and when you talk to the
[55:20] woman you must come from a point where
[55:22] you know what you're talking about they
[55:24] they're not stupid and they very soft
[55:27] and so if you come as a brother and you
[55:28] just blast another sister because she
[55:30] looks different you'll hurt that
[55:32] one because men want to fix stuff but
[55:36] women don't want to fix
[55:38] stuff no
[55:41] ways okay remember that thing with about
[55:44] they don't want to fix stuff so we as
[55:46] brothers can't go to sisters and want to
[55:48] fix them right now because they don't
[55:50] look the part you will break
[55:52] them but sisters
[55:56] he says and I think that any woman that
[55:59] is motherly and godly and sisterly ought
[56:02] to go to such a person and with
[56:04] sweetness of the spirit just sit down
[56:06] and talk to the lady he says and if she
[56:10] is God if she is of God the holy spirit
[56:12] will understand those things see who is
[56:15] he talking to in the
[56:18] sister if she's of God the Holy Spirit
[56:21] within her will understand these things
[56:24] and what happens and she will correct
[56:27] herself it will just come in from here
[56:29] cuz it will resonate but what did it
[56:31] take it took love it took a motherly
[56:34] soft gentleness to go and speak about
[56:37] these things it doesn't take a pastor
[56:39] every Sunday to hit these
[56:41] things it's a multim member work amen we
[56:45] all still there everybody awake amen
[56:48] Liam's yawning is doing well but when
[56:51] you real quickly condemn her you will
[56:53] drive her away and you might harm harm
[56:56] that Young born
[56:59] baby so where did we come from do we
[57:02] forget so
[57:09] quickly I left my notes there a while
[57:12] ago let's see is that yeah that's a one
[57:14] now the person speaking with tongues now
[57:16] he's addressing another thing but it's
[57:17] just the very next line he says now I
[57:19] have to say something here he interrupts
[57:21] his thought and he says this might be a
[57:23] little strange and if you don't agree
[57:25] with me that's that's okay you see we
[57:28] misjudge these things so many times
[57:30] let's always try to think the very best
[57:33] of anyone who's trying to do what's
[57:36] right so what is our
[57:39] motive he's
[57:41] trying he's
[57:43] walking he might be crawling he might be
[57:45] dragging he might be leopard crawling
[57:48] but he's moving
[57:50] forward okay he says oh let's express
[57:54] our very best to them oh they are trying
[57:57] we don't know their heart unless they
[57:59] have discernment now discernment is a
[58:02] gift you get and some people can see
[58:04] right through other people and people
[58:06] like me I've employed many of people
[58:08] when I was with Downer and those type of
[58:09] things and boy man that I look I don't
[58:12] see like other managers see because they
[58:14] had very good discernment I'm just
[58:16] everyone's friend CU I love you okay I
[58:19] really love you unconditionally but feel
[58:22] your love has conditions okay and if
[58:25] they were wrong
[58:27] then if you got it the Bible said if a
[58:29] brother be overtaken in Fault now
[58:32] Brothers Here Comes it to you as well
[58:33] let them which your spirit shall go to
[58:35] the brother in the spirit of
[58:39] meekness he says considering your own
[58:42] self least you be
[58:45] tempted so what happens and I've seen it
[58:47] so many times and that is and it's times
[58:49] and times that this happen as a brother
[58:51] comes to you and he runs his mouth over
[58:53] someone else's either family or
[58:55] situation and everything and he's just
[58:57] going for it and he's unloading and he's
[58:58] unloading and you stand back and you go
[59:00] be careful you don't have the Revelation
[59:03] to do that now it sounds like oh we're
[59:06] very spiritual now no I'm an old monkey
[59:10] I fell out of a lot of trees it hurts so
[59:14] when I go to you and I say as a as a
[59:15] Elder of the church say maybe don't go
[59:18] there because when you fall out of this
[59:19] tree you're going to fall on your face
[59:21] it's not a brother being lifted up it's
[59:23] a brother with meekness coming to you
[59:25] and say don't do this this is not the
[59:28] right way to do it listen to them
[59:30] because when you do it out of season and
[59:33] out of the will of God it has
[59:34] repercussions for
[59:36] you so if you don't do it in meekness
[59:39] and you don't pray before you do it for
[59:41] that brother and for you then what
[59:43] happens is you get tempted too so before
[59:45] you know it you're sitting in his very
[59:46] same trial because what comes out of
[59:49] this mouth God will go oh really Let's
[59:52] test it how many times have you you
[59:55] young men and and and brothers that
[59:57] preach You Preach something over the
[59:58] pulpit and that very next week what
[1:00:00] happens you get tested a little bit
[1:00:03] harder than you think but you get tested
[1:00:04] on what you just said so God is not a
[1:00:07] respector of persons if you preaching
[1:00:10] the gospel and you bringing forth a word
[1:00:12] God's going to say sorry what did you
[1:00:13] say Aran amen you're going to get tested
[1:00:16] that's how he works because he wants you
[1:00:18] to know what you're talking
[1:00:21] about okay and then tell them to come
[1:00:24] back to God so we persuade him we
[1:00:26] reconcile him we we win a brother to
[1:00:28] Christ the the the attitude of the
[1:00:30] believer when we do that is love I need
[1:00:32] to win my brother to Christ but don't do
[1:00:34] it out of zeal don't do it out of
[1:00:36] frustration or or even out of
[1:00:38] determination don't do that wait for the
[1:00:40] Leaning of the holy spirit because then
[1:00:42] you will win a brother to Christ because
[1:00:44] then you're doing it under the anointing
[1:00:46] of God and God's working on both sides
[1:00:48] his side and your side and now if you go
[1:00:51] to him in meekness and you tell him that
[1:00:53] then all of a sudden healing takes place
[1:00:56] and he comes back
[1:00:59] amen he says when love is projected well
[1:01:04] well we're almost on time man that's
[1:01:06] good when love is projective with the
[1:01:08] right motive behind it divine grace
[1:01:10] steps in Hallelujah now now I was
[1:01:13] shouting because brother Bean he
[1:01:15] preached my Sunday sermon on Sunday so I
[1:01:18] had to get a new one this was this
[1:01:21] one thank you brother ban cuz what
[1:01:25] happened is I want wanted to talk about
[1:01:26] where were you when Jesus was on the
[1:01:29] cross where were you when he stood
[1:01:31] before Pilate where were you when Moses
[1:01:33] was before Pharaoh where were you when
[1:01:36] Daniel and the lion then where were you
[1:01:38] you were in all of them that's why you
[1:01:40] can find yourself in the scripture as
[1:01:42] you walk through the pages and this
[1:01:44] sunite woman now he's talking about that
[1:01:46] woman that that that um woman that was
[1:01:49] waiting at the gate for him and he says
[1:01:51] here when love is projected with the
[1:01:53] right motive behind it so remember the
[1:01:55] Holy Spirit led him down the road he was
[1:01:57] just saying Lord here we go just walking
[1:02:00] he didn't know what was going on he says
[1:02:02] Divine Grace has stepped in he says now
[1:02:04] not knowing I said while your boy is
[1:02:07] dying she said yes when I patted her on
[1:02:11] the back she was still wet from The
[1:02:13] Morning Dew so this lady was desperate
[1:02:18] she had love for a child not feo love
[1:02:21] she had Godly love for a child and only
[1:02:24] and I can find it so much in my
[1:02:26] but but it should be in us as brothers
[1:02:28] as well she was not going to take no for
[1:02:30] an answer she was speaking to God and
[1:02:32] God was going to answer her and she was
[1:02:34] standing there early morning she was
[1:02:36] waiting for the prophet to come down for
[1:02:38] her Elijah to come down so this is not
[1:02:41] this is not she's desperate but she's
[1:02:44] not that desperate that she's standing
[1:02:46] there wondering she knows her visitation
[1:02:49] is coming amen and he says and she had a
[1:02:52] man's skirt shirt tied around her your
[1:02:56] head and I thought oh God this must be
[1:02:59] it see and just led by the spirit of God
[1:03:02] all hopes was gone but love was still
[1:03:04] there love doesn't fear it waits on
[1:03:08] Grace So when When Love is
[1:03:11] projected for her son and she knew
[1:03:14] there's only one way Lord just see what
[1:03:17] I do I've done everything for my child
[1:03:19] you mothers with your children When Love
[1:03:22] is projected and you come before God you
[1:03:25] speak to him and say Lord I ain't going
[1:03:27] here until he comes because see Divine
[1:03:30] Love Goes further than feel your love
[1:03:33] feel your love is the the guys
[1:03:35] disappoint us and we kind of want to
[1:03:37] write them off but Divine Love Goes
[1:03:39] further than that says Lord I canot
[1:03:42] forget him I will not forget him I will
[1:03:45] pray on my knees until the blood comes
[1:03:47] out but I want his soul amen and she had
[1:03:50] no other way to go but her love pushed
[1:03:53] her for a child so far that she started
[1:03:56] reading her type in that Bible and she
[1:03:57] knew that she had to get a a visitation
[1:04:00] from Elijah and she wasn't going to
[1:04:02] settle for anything else because she was
[1:04:04] in that word that love was so strong
[1:04:07] that's Divine love that is a gapo love
[1:04:10] that is you boys can do whatever you
[1:04:12] want but your moms are praying for your
[1:04:15] love that is love that touches touches
[1:04:17] the hym of Jesus's Garment of the Lord's
[1:04:20] garment and it makes him stop and it
[1:04:23] makes him listen because because God
[1:04:26] wants you to pray that way not just for
[1:04:28] your loved ones but for all your loved
[1:04:31] ones
[1:04:33] amen he says now Prophet St the mouth of
[1:04:36] a righteous man is well is a well of
[1:04:38] life but violence coverthe mouth of the
[1:04:41] wicked hate hate stirreth up strives but
[1:04:45] love covers all
[1:04:47] sin so love doesn't turn a blind eye it
[1:04:52] covers
[1:04:53] it l is I know my brother is is wrong
[1:04:56] I'm going to pray for him I'm going to
[1:04:58] bring him before God it doesn't it
[1:05:01] doesn't sugarcoat Sin Sin is Sin that's
[1:05:03] why when you when a Brother's sing you
[1:05:05] is doing something wrong Brothers you
[1:05:06] get along you go to him you have a chat
[1:05:08] with him you you get in you you go and
[1:05:10] win a brother to Christ with all that
[1:05:12] you can pray before the time he says but
[1:05:16] it covers sin because you're not seeing
[1:05:17] the sin anymore you're now seeing The
[1:05:20] Sinner and you need to know that if the
[1:05:22] sin is gone you're dealing with the
[1:05:23] person you your your your more soft
[1:05:26] towards the person but if you still see
[1:05:28] the sin you deal with the sin you're
[1:05:30] going to hurt that person do you
[1:05:32] understand it you cannot you cannot go
[1:05:34] to a person out of a complex or out a
[1:05:36] frustration because then you're dealing
[1:05:38] with his sin you're not dealing with a
[1:05:41] sinner you can't win him
[1:05:43] back he says the lips of him that hath
[1:05:47] understanding wisdom is found but the
[1:05:49] rod of the back that himm is void of
[1:05:52] understanding so it says there's a rod
[1:05:54] for your back if you being silly young
[1:05:58] men there's a rod for your back if your
[1:06:01] dad and mom is trying to help you and
[1:06:03] you willingly don't want to do it
[1:06:04] there's a rod for your back they don't
[1:06:06] say your dad's going to hit you I'll go
[1:06:09] on with it half nine
[1:06:11] phas book of
[1:06:13] Samuel Eli the priest you can go and do
[1:06:17] this homework go read uh 1 Samuel 22-17
[1:06:21] and then go we'll we'll touch on 1
[1:06:23] Samuel 25 to 22 to2 five the people come
[1:06:27] before Eli and they say hey your sons
[1:06:32] your sons are busy doing
[1:06:34] wrong the promise that God made you is
[1:06:37] that you will offer sacrifice in in my
[1:06:39] temple you'll be the
[1:06:40] priest but yes Eli you're you're in your
[1:06:43] position but your sons are doing
[1:06:47] wrong and Eli goes and he says to his
[1:06:50] sons name my sons for it's not a good
[1:06:53] report what I hear but I want you to
[1:06:56] listen this is not for me this is not
[1:06:59] for me a dad loving his
[1:07:02] children now you must follow me this is
[1:07:04] just God said to him the people come to
[1:07:07] him and murmur and he goes to his
[1:07:08] children and he goes you're doing wrong
[1:07:11] and I'll I'll I'll bring it all I'll tie
[1:07:12] it together hold on nay my sons no good
[1:07:16] report that ye make of the Lord's people
[1:07:17] to transgress if one man sins against
[1:07:20] another the judge shall judge him but if
[1:07:23] a man sins against the Lord who shall
[1:07:26] entreat for him not withstanding they
[1:07:29] hearken not un the voice of their father
[1:07:31] because the Lord would slay
[1:07:34] them so your mom and dad comes and
[1:07:38] corrects
[1:07:40] you your mom and dad comes and talks to
[1:07:43] you out of love seeing that you are
[1:07:44] walking off the word of God don't fall
[1:07:48] asleep on me this is this is this is
[1:07:50] your kids
[1:07:53] follow this is important I'm not I'm I I
[1:07:56] love you I I want you to understand this
[1:07:59] they unfortunately if you don't listen
[1:08:01] to your parents there's things that
[1:08:03] happen for that there's a consequence to
[1:08:06] it I don't want bad things to happen to
[1:08:08] anyone not any one of my boys not any
[1:08:10] one of you but if you don't listen you
[1:08:12] don't hearken into a voice there's a
[1:08:15] penalty it's not your dad sorting you
[1:08:18] out it's God going to sort you out this
[1:08:22] is real stuff man amen I've experienced
[1:08:25] in my life walking away from my dad's
[1:08:27] counsel and all that I got was heartache
[1:08:30] and pain I'm meaning it out of love for
[1:08:33] you young people you don't need to love
[1:08:36] your parents nowhere in the Bible says
[1:08:39] children love your parents not that I
[1:08:41] read of it says honor your
[1:08:44] parents honor means listen obey it
[1:08:48] doesn't mean love me you can love me as
[1:08:50] much as you like and you can still curse
[1:08:52] me to my face and you can still turn
[1:08:54] away and walk in in sin because half
[1:08:56] nine phas didn't listen to their dad
[1:08:59] when he said guys don't sin against
[1:09:01] God this was not a easy thing this was a
[1:09:04] hard saying and for a dad to come to
[1:09:07] your children to say you're busy sinning
[1:09:09] against God there's coming a reaping for
[1:09:11] that cuz you're sewing something that's
[1:09:13] bad you should remember that if you
[1:09:15] don't listen there's coming a sewing of
[1:09:18] what a reaping of what you sewed that's
[1:09:20] not Mom and Dad they don't want it for
[1:09:23] you but you bring it on you because you
[1:09:26] harden your heart you don't need to love
[1:09:28] us as parents that just comes naturally
[1:09:32] you need to honor them amen it says here
[1:09:36] honor thy father and thy mother that's
[1:09:37] the the Commandment Exodus 2012 write it
[1:09:40] on your your cupboard if you need to put
[1:09:43] it on your
[1:09:44] phone whatever you need to do kids
[1:09:47] remind yourself of this this is very
[1:09:48] important because we want you to succeed
[1:09:51] we want you to walk with God we had our
[1:09:54] chance we messed it up we made mistakes
[1:09:56] we paid for them you don't need to walk
[1:09:58] that way this message has overcoming
[1:10:00] power you don't need to Walk This Way
[1:10:03] the prophet of God says you don't need
[1:10:05] to go you can overcome there's enough
[1:10:07] Holy Spirit here that will raise you
[1:10:08] Above This filth of this
[1:10:11] world you don't need to worry about you
[1:10:13] can overcome but what you should do is
[1:10:15] what the Bible tells you to do it says
[1:10:16] honor the father and mother and here's
[1:10:18] your promise that your days May Bel long
[1:10:21] in the land that the Lord God has given
[1:10:22] you now Hine and Phineas didn't listen
[1:10:24] to Eli
[1:10:26] what happened who knows the
[1:10:29] story they
[1:10:31] died because they didn't hearken into
[1:10:34] the voice of their father they died and
[1:10:37] they transgressed the law of God and
[1:10:39] they died there was a penalty of death
[1:10:41] here no not saying all of you going to
[1:10:44] die but spiritually you might
[1:10:47] die because you think you're
[1:10:49] something the Bible says just honor them
[1:10:53] didn't say figure out what he
[1:10:55] sometimes I preach to Reuben and Li and
[1:10:57] they
[1:10:57] like have no idea what I just said but
[1:11:01] when I say can you please go to your
[1:11:02] room they go yes Dad
[1:11:03] fine they still honor what I said later
[1:11:07] in life when they have children guess
[1:11:09] what Revelation comes but all you need
[1:11:12] to do now is just listen to your mom and
[1:11:14] dad don't say you always have to agree
[1:11:17] listen to
[1:11:18] them they're there for you it says here
[1:11:22] in Colossians 3:20 so I'm not just
[1:11:24] pulling this is scripture
[1:11:25] this is the Lord telling us just listen
[1:11:27] to this it says children obey your
[1:11:30] parents in all things for It is Well
[1:11:32] pleasing unto the Lord so there's
[1:11:34] there's something that if you listen
[1:11:36] just to Mom and Dad God says bro I got
[1:11:38] your back still you walk between you and
[1:11:41] God but you're doing
[1:11:43] well don't worry we're going to the dads
[1:11:46] now so but but we'll get there so now
[1:11:49] here's the here's the and we're almost
[1:11:51] there man I'm trying to get through this
[1:11:53] I just got a couple of slides left okay
[1:11:55] we'll go fast and it came that the man
[1:11:58] of God went to Eli and said to him thus
[1:12:00] sayith the Lord um I didn't I plainly
[1:12:03] appear to you in the house of thy father
[1:12:05] when you were in Egypt and Pharaoh's
[1:12:06] house and then I chose you out of out of
[1:12:08] the tribes of of Israel to be my priest
[1:12:12] to offer upon my altar the burning in
[1:12:14] incense so it was a privilege for Eli
[1:12:17] and and his dad and and all his family
[1:12:19] to walk with God but see Eli was walking
[1:12:21] with God but he wasn't raising his
[1:12:24] children right
[1:12:27] because that that rebuke was was for me
[1:12:29] just yeah the people told me you're
[1:12:31] wrong there was I just don't feel there
[1:12:33] was an urgency to to go and and shake
[1:12:35] them and go man when your dad wants to
[1:12:37] shake you it's when he knows you're so
[1:12:40] wrong right now that you're standing at
[1:12:42] this Crossroad and if I just can't get
[1:12:44] through to you you will see
[1:12:46] it was we want you to succeed but now
[1:12:50] what happened is because he put his sons
[1:12:52] before God and this is what happens he
[1:12:54] says to wear the little e for but will
[1:12:56] is go a bit where KCK ye at My Sacrifice
[1:12:58] at my offering which I've commanded into
[1:13:01] the habitation and honorous thou Sons
[1:13:04] above
[1:13:05] me so instead of them just taking them
[1:13:07] and giving them a massive box law and
[1:13:09] chasing them out of the church and say
[1:13:10] you know what if you're that bad just
[1:13:12] rather go but don't transgress against
[1:13:15] God he still left them in their
[1:13:19] position still left them to do what they
[1:13:21] did yeah oh boys don't do it sorry don't
[1:13:24] do it
[1:13:25] but you're still priests knowing that
[1:13:28] they still transgressing
[1:13:30] God so there was a reaping for
[1:13:34] that it's a it's a happy service don't
[1:13:36] worry we're getting there I want you I
[1:13:38] want you to realize that the love the
[1:13:40] love that God talks about agapo loveia
[1:13:42] is the love that your father has for you
[1:13:44] to see that you're going wrong it is it
[1:13:47] is something more than just a feel your
[1:13:49] love it's God stepping into your dad and
[1:13:51] trying to guide you as a young man and
[1:13:53] young woman and and I'm talking about
[1:13:55] the dad because the dad is the the head
[1:13:57] of the house and the and the wife is
[1:13:59] underneath him but the dad is the one
[1:14:01] that that has to sometimes just deliver
[1:14:03] the male as it is and guess what you
[1:14:05] hate him for it sometimes you do come on
[1:14:09] man but when your dad correct you just
[1:14:11] loved him always hey oh thanks Dad you
[1:14:14] hate him for it sometimes because he
[1:14:16] says sorry you can't go tomorrow with so
[1:14:18] and so because I don't trust that
[1:14:21] guy is that
[1:14:24] love I was so angry at my dad one day I
[1:14:26] slammed the door in his face was that
[1:14:30] love so all of us are subject he never
[1:14:33] said love your dad he said just do
[1:14:36] it just do it because or else there's a
[1:14:40] a reaping wherefore the Lord of God of
[1:14:42] Israel say I said indeed that their
[1:14:44] house is the house of the father that
[1:14:46] walk before me forever but now the Lord
[1:14:49] saith be AAR from me them that honor me
[1:14:52] will I honor and they that um
[1:14:55] uh despise me shall I lightly esteem so
[1:15:00] now all the good work that Eli did all
[1:15:02] his
[1:15:03] life but he didn't look after his
[1:15:06] children he just let them do whatever
[1:15:08] they want to he didn't get desperate
[1:15:10] enough had a had a reward and the sons
[1:15:14] that couldn't humble themselves to
[1:15:15] listen to their dad now had a reward and
[1:15:17] he says they shall be no old man in thy
[1:15:21] house and his lineage died
[1:15:27] so the promise that God says in the Ten
[1:15:29] Commandments he says that the that when
[1:15:31] they spoke to Jesus said what is the two
[1:15:33] greatest
[1:15:35] Commandments love the Lord thy God and
[1:15:38] love your neighbors love everyone as you
[1:15:40] love yourself but see that love is not
[1:15:42] aili your love that's man this is
[1:15:44] serious stuff so if you love your dad
[1:15:47] with a agapo love you would listen to
[1:15:50] him you don't need to love him with a
[1:15:52] feel your love right now when he gave
[1:15:54] you the news have a gapo love for him
[1:15:57] know that he's trying really hard to do
[1:15:58] the best for you guys
[1:16:02] amen so because they didn't follow
[1:16:06] this there was a a
[1:16:10] reaping okay dads fathers provoke not
[1:16:14] your
[1:16:15] children to
[1:16:17] anger least they be
[1:16:20] discouraged so this is when us as dads
[1:16:22] step in and we want to fix it
[1:16:25] we want to and because right now what he
[1:16:28] did annoyed you so much and I'm so
[1:16:31] guilty of it and that's why I said I had
[1:16:32] to eat the sermon today you act out of
[1:16:36] carnality out of f your love that you
[1:16:38] lose right at that situation because the
[1:16:40] the honesty of your child or the
[1:16:43] dumbness of him or the whatever had you
[1:16:46] so frustrated now you just act out now
[1:16:50] the kids are laughing they're
[1:16:53] like and you do something that is just
[1:16:57] ridiculous and you're so angry with
[1:16:59] yourself because that's just what you
[1:17:01] did you discouraged them because you
[1:17:04] didn't God don't do it with you every
[1:17:06] time you sin but we do it with our boys
[1:17:08] every time they sin we just kicked them
[1:17:11] in the face man bye I told you go to
[1:17:13] your room shut up and end of the time
[1:17:16] you're thinking what did I just do you
[1:17:19] just discouraged your children because
[1:17:20] you would did it out of anger
[1:17:24] and sometimes I have to count to 100 cuz
[1:17:27] 10 don't do
[1:17:29] it and 100 is far I lost count to 50 and
[1:17:32] I to start over and that makes me every
[1:17:34] AG agree so just send them away go talk
[1:17:37] to the Lord about it I I don't do it
[1:17:38] good either but this is what I got
[1:17:41] today because I'm supposed to represent
[1:17:43] Christ and Christ had when I was lost in
[1:17:45] the world didn't just come and cut me
[1:17:47] off and send me to
[1:17:49] hell he knew when to call me so
[1:17:52] sometimes you might not speak on that
[1:17:54] and you might be very very angry just
[1:17:55] turn around and say hold that thought
[1:17:57] and walk away because there will be a
[1:18:00] time where you can sit with him and talk
[1:18:01] to him and win him to Christ because
[1:18:04] then you speak out of divine love then
[1:18:06] you speak with agapo love but when you
[1:18:08] lose Filly Your Love Don't Speak CU then
[1:18:11] you hurt then you throw
[1:18:14] punches Ephesians 6:1-4 children again
[1:18:17] this is for you obey your
[1:18:19] parents for this
[1:18:23] is thank you he's still awake for this
[1:18:26] is right okay honor thy father and thy
[1:18:30] mother not understand your father and
[1:18:32] mother not love thy father and mother
[1:18:35] honor thy father and mother which is the
[1:18:37] first commandment with a promise that it
[1:18:39] may be well with the and ye fathers
[1:18:42] provoke not your children to wrath but
[1:18:45] bring them up in the nature and
[1:18:46] admonition of the Lord the what the
[1:18:49] nature of the Lord so leave your
[1:18:52] carnality stay with love I had a couple
[1:18:55] of notes that we will skip on cuz I see
[1:18:56] you all you're all
[1:18:58] dwindling it's just because it's such
[1:19:00] small writing I can't read it there
[1:19:02] that's why I had this one okay now I
[1:19:05] picked on the fathers I picked on the
[1:19:07] mothers now we're going to pick on the
[1:19:09] husbands but first the wives he says
[1:19:13] give thanks always to all things of God
[1:19:16] the Father this is Ephesians 5:20
[1:19:18] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:19:20] fear of God wives submit yourself unto
[1:19:23] your own husbands as unto the
[1:19:26] Lord so if you want to see if you want
[1:19:30] to see if a a wife is submitted to her
[1:19:33] husband or if she's really submitted to
[1:19:35] God look how she deals with her
[1:19:42] husband think just let it
[1:19:45] drop if she's treating a
[1:19:48] husband really bad she's being Miss
[1:19:52] Bossy boots and all those things and
[1:19:54] just one her way and what guess what how
[1:19:56] she's treating God it's the same because
[1:19:59] God is the head of your husband and if
[1:20:01] your husband is not in his position
[1:20:03] you're under headship of God so how you
[1:20:05] talk to your husband is how you talk to
[1:20:07] God if he's in or out doesn't matter
[1:20:09] because if you're under God and your
[1:20:12] husband's not under God you'll treat
[1:20:14] your husband as if he's God you won't
[1:20:18] always agree with everything to him but
[1:20:20] you'll have reverence for him you'll
[1:20:22] have you'll honor him because he might
[1:20:25] be out of his position but you're still
[1:20:28] in your position Christ is still your
[1:20:30] head and you by your prayers like
[1:20:32] brother Brandon Met the story where the
[1:20:34] three drunkards was was drinking and and
[1:20:36] the sister brings them all back because
[1:20:38] she was in fellowship with God she still
[1:20:40] honored a husband he came in he was
[1:20:42] drunk and he pretended to be drunk and
[1:20:43] she still went about a business still
[1:20:45] loved him was still soft just just
[1:20:48] didn't understand what's going on but
[1:20:50] she was just pushing on and she won
[1:20:52] three souls to Christ
[1:20:55] so the thing is the honoring your
[1:20:57] husband is not condoning what he's doing
[1:20:59] if he's not in Christ it's how you talk
[1:21:02] to Christ you will talk to your husband
[1:21:04] if you find yourself not talking to your
[1:21:06] husband like you should talk to Christ
[1:21:09] you got a problem there you need to take
[1:21:11] it before the Lord because when I read
[1:21:14] this it says why submit yourself um as
[1:21:18] unto the Lord as the husband is the head
[1:21:22] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[1:21:24] of the church and he is the savior of
[1:21:27] the body therefore as the church is
[1:21:30] subjected to Christ so let the wives be
[1:21:33] to their own husbands in
[1:21:37] everything subject it
[1:21:40] means I just do it now hold on I know
[1:21:43] there's now a lot of thoughts
[1:21:45] going follow me okay don't miss me now I
[1:21:48] do this in love because I sat and I
[1:21:50] asked the Lord just just show me this he
[1:21:53] says
[1:21:55] your husband is not serving the lord you
[1:21:58] serve the Lord first but you stay loving
[1:22:01] your
[1:22:02] husband Christ is your head if you love
[1:22:06] Christ with all your heart you will love
[1:22:09] your husband with all your
[1:22:11] heart and that love that you have will
[1:22:14] bring your husband back into his
[1:22:17] position because if the love for a the
[1:22:19] sunite woman could bring healing for a
[1:22:22] child then love for your husband can
[1:22:25] bring him back to
[1:22:27] God it's a it's a it's more than just
[1:22:30] feel your love this is deep love aapo
[1:22:33] love not turning a blind eye to what he
[1:22:36] does if he's in or not or whatever it's
[1:22:38] loving him like you love Christ and if
[1:22:40] you can do that your husband will be a
[1:22:42] king and you will be the
[1:22:45] queen
[1:22:46] amen he says wife submit your husband um
[1:22:49] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[1:22:51] it's fit in the Lord
[1:22:54] so remember the Lord May guide you as
[1:22:56] well we know there's been a lot of lot
[1:22:59] of how can you say Shenanigans a lot of
[1:23:02] things happen that would hurt husband
[1:23:04] and wife it's a very sacred place and
[1:23:07] and Satan will always try to tear you
[1:23:08] two apart that is his job he just wants
[1:23:11] to what God brings together he just
[1:23:13] wants to
[1:23:14] break but but as a wife if you respect
[1:23:17] and honor your head you will get the
[1:23:19] reward for it you'll reap what you sow
[1:23:25] hold
[1:23:27] on
[1:23:29] husbands love your wives I've got 10
[1:23:31] minutes left I'll finish I'll five
[1:23:34] slides just all are you all still there
[1:23:36] I'm not fighting I'm talking about love
[1:23:39] I'm talking about a gapo love I'm not
[1:23:41] talking about just love your husband cuz
[1:23:43] he bought you something nice or he's
[1:23:45] giving you flowers or a hamburger my
[1:23:48] wife loves hamburgers more than flowers
[1:23:50] I'm sure of it I always buy her
[1:23:51] hamburger flowers are too expensive
[1:23:54] husbands if they bring the price of
[1:23:56] flowers down I'll buy a flowers okay
[1:23:58] husbands no I'll get you flowers one day
[1:24:00] I promise husbands love your wives it's
[1:24:03] on record even as Christ also loved the
[1:24:06] church and gave himself for it so you as
[1:24:10] a husband you've got a
[1:24:12] commission your commission James and
[1:24:16] you're going to see it soon as it says
[1:24:18] love your wife he says but you must give
[1:24:22] yourself to her so now that it sees us
[1:24:25] she's not just submitting to you but
[1:24:27] you're submitting to her as
[1:24:29] well because Christ gave his life to us
[1:24:33] as a church he went and paid the
[1:24:35] ultimate um penalty punishment by death
[1:24:38] for us his blood was shed for
[1:24:41] us that's you and your
[1:24:45] wife even if she asked you to wash the
[1:24:48] dishes I just said that you go I can
[1:24:51] help you because you know what you're in
[1:24:54] it
[1:24:55] together but see Divine love God's love
[1:24:59] is whatever she asks it means a lot to
[1:25:03] you like King azerus when Esther came
[1:25:06] before him whatever she asked he stopped
[1:25:08] the whole thing that was going on
[1:25:11] pointed out his scepter to him and says
[1:25:12] come in my queen what do you want how
[1:25:16] was divine love and all she asked him
[1:25:19] what was she doesn't say wash the dishes
[1:25:21] just for your sisters she said I just
[1:25:23] want to spend time with you I've got
[1:25:25] something that's bothering me but I need
[1:25:27] some time with you and what did he do he
[1:25:30] went to a feast he didn't ignore her he
[1:25:33] spent time with
[1:25:34] her and he had to do it twice because
[1:25:37] she wasn't really ready to share this
[1:25:38] with him she was in fear and then she
[1:25:41] she asked him again can he come again
[1:25:42] and the next night that's when hmon was
[1:25:44] exposed but sometimes your wife might
[1:25:46] ask you
[1:25:48] Brothers for a bit of time and that's
[1:25:51] where we must be sensitive and stop and
[1:25:54] listen to what her wife says because
[1:25:56] she's got something that's concerning
[1:25:58] her and she she wants to talk to you you
[1:26:01] have to lay everything aside even your
[1:26:03] own
[1:26:05] life for your wife as Christ did it for
[1:26:09] us he says so ought men to love their
[1:26:13] wives verse 28 wives as their own bodies
[1:26:17] he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:26:21] himself now love I love you L cuz I love
[1:26:26] myself and I'll tell you why because the
[1:26:29] old me I
[1:26:30] hated but the one that God is busy
[1:26:33] making I'm loving every day because I
[1:26:35] can see more of him in my life I can see
[1:26:37] more of of what he's doing in my life
[1:26:40] situations can be desperate and and
[1:26:42] things can be like brother um Isaac
[1:26:44] preached you can be in a desolate place
[1:26:46] real far in here absolutely struggling
[1:26:49] with something but your wife will come
[1:26:52] and says lover you right and all I have
[1:26:54] to say for her just pray for
[1:26:57] me and I know it will go better see the
[1:27:00] love that's Divine love we need to have
[1:27:02] this operate in our church we need to
[1:27:04] have it operate amongst go don't go feel
[1:27:06] your love don't go paper thin it goes
[1:27:09] more than that you Brothers husbands
[1:27:11] loves your wives and be not bitter
[1:27:14] against
[1:27:15] them it said husbands understand your
[1:27:20] wives
[1:27:22] no nobody can understand a woman not
[1:27:26] even themselves Point finish CLA okay
[1:27:29] they can't they're all laughing but they
[1:27:30] know it's true all your sisters know
[1:27:32] it's true okay they the most up and down
[1:27:35] in their heads whatever can be you can
[1:27:36] be on the mountain The Valley in the
[1:27:37] Mountain Valley go where are you I'm
[1:27:39] very angry okay she's on the valley I'm
[1:27:41] happy oh yeah I can watch dishes yes
[1:27:43] watch dishes she's happy again yes she's
[1:27:45] happy again leave the dishes watch the
[1:27:47] dishes she's in the valley she's in the
[1:27:48] valley so sometimes we as husbands we
[1:27:50] just have to do things that we don't
[1:27:52] like to do but remember they don't
[1:27:55] understand themselves but it doesn't
[1:27:57] tell you understand them it says
[1:27:58] husbands love your
[1:28:00] wife CU you will never understand them
[1:28:03] and you young men that ever think you
[1:28:04] can buy a book that is how woman Works
[1:28:08] they ain't such a
[1:28:10] book because it would be written by a
[1:28:13] woman and halfway she disagreed with
[1:28:15] what she had written in the first place
[1:28:16] and then we have to start again she
[1:28:18] never got past page
[1:28:21] 10 it's true okay there's a little bit
[1:28:25] of humor I'm just saying but those who
[1:28:27] keepeth his word in him verily is the
[1:28:30] love of God perfected hereby know that
[1:28:34] um what that we are in
[1:28:37] him that we that we are in him so if you
[1:28:41] want to know one John says if you want
[1:28:44] to know if you have God's perfect love
[1:28:48] in your heart in your life in every
[1:28:51] situation the very first thing you need
[1:28:53] to do is is what keep his
[1:28:58] word if you keep his word all other
[1:29:01] things just works
[1:29:04] out keeping his word is sometimes the
[1:29:07] hardest thing to do because we try to
[1:29:09] understand God he didn't say understand
[1:29:12] my
[1:29:13] word he says just keep my word this is
[1:29:15] like the dad saying to the son boy just
[1:29:19] don't do this right
[1:29:22] now and it doesn't matter if you
[1:29:25] understand why your dad says this or how
[1:29:27] this ties it beautifully and I want you
[1:29:29] to realize it just says just keep my
[1:29:32] word because in that I know that love is
[1:29:35] perfected in you because when you don't
[1:29:38] understand your dad that's when you need
[1:29:40] love I'll finish with this so here's the
[1:29:42] story of Peter and I'll just quickly
[1:29:43] tell it because that's where we end and
[1:29:45] then the musicians can come up I'll call
[1:29:47] you now Peter goes to Jesus and he says
[1:29:50] to Jesus when before Jesus went up to be
[1:29:53] crucified he said said to Jesus I will
[1:29:55] die with you I'm just paraphrasing cuz I
[1:29:58] know it's bit late I'll die with you
[1:30:01] I'll go and I'll die with you and Jesus
[1:30:04] says you will deny me three
[1:30:08] times so Peter loved the Lord but he
[1:30:11] didn't really truly understand what love
[1:30:14] was at that moment because his love is
[1:30:16] I'll die for you and of course all the
[1:30:19] disciples went yes we'll die with you
[1:30:21] and then the Lord said to them the Sheep
[1:30:24] will
[1:30:24] scatter when they catch me all your
[1:30:26] sheep will scatter I'm just paraphrasing
[1:30:28] I wanted to read it but you go read it
[1:30:30] Matthew 26:26 you can't miss it 2626
[1:30:33] Matthew 2626 go read it okay and then he
[1:30:38] tells them this is what's going to
[1:30:39] happen and they go no it won't happen
[1:30:41] because they were excited because this
[1:30:43] was after it was the Passover and he
[1:30:45] broke the bread and he says drink eat
[1:30:47] the bread for it's my body and he says
[1:30:49] drink the wine for it's my blood of the
[1:30:51] New Testament and they have and they
[1:30:53] finished up the service with a him so
[1:30:56] they had a service so everybody walks
[1:30:58] out of there and Jesus is starting to
[1:31:00] tell them that this is what's going to
[1:31:02] happen and because they still under the
[1:31:04] influence of a cool service and Camp was
[1:31:06] going it was easy to love one another
[1:31:09] and it was easy to say yeah I'll die for
[1:31:11] you brother fish easy I got your back
[1:31:13] I'll die for you but that still feel
[1:31:15] your love he did not understand what
[1:31:18] Jesus was saying and then Jesus because
[1:31:20] he loves him back says you will deny me
[1:31:22] three times
[1:31:24] because he knew that Peter didn't know
[1:31:26] this love that he was talking about
[1:31:28] right now he didn't know what love is he
[1:31:30] knew filo love but he didn't know agap
[1:31:32] love so what happens Peter denies him
[1:31:37] 2669 he goes and denies him and he even
[1:31:40] swears he curses and I don't know this
[1:31:43] guy I have a oath I don't know him and
[1:31:45] he walks away from the Lord and he says
[1:31:47] and Peter wept
[1:31:49] bitterly so now everything happened the
[1:31:53] Road he looks at Jesus he knew oh
[1:31:55] mate it's all done I've I've messed up
[1:31:58] now Revelation hits his heart because
[1:32:01] now he understood that he didn't have
[1:32:04] the love that he just spoke about when
[1:32:06] he said Lord I'll die with you because
[1:32:09] if you really loved the Lord now here
[1:32:11] Here Comes Satan in hammers him if you
[1:32:13] really loved the Lord you would have
[1:32:14] been on your cross too if you really was
[1:32:17] a Christian I hope you're following me
[1:32:19] you'll do the right thing you will never
[1:32:20] say bad thing to the sister or brother
[1:32:22] because you got a Goa
[1:32:24] you just didn't understand love
[1:32:26] yet so Peter Peter does this and he's
[1:32:30] just you know what he gives up he says I
[1:32:32] I'm going back fishing I'm just going to
[1:32:34] go back fishing and his real real heart
[1:32:37] sore and broken and the Lord Jesus comes
[1:32:40] their way and they throw the net over
[1:32:42] the the boat and they haven't caught
[1:32:44] fish all day and Jesus didn't forget
[1:32:47] Peter though Peter didn't understand
[1:32:50] love God knew love and he knew Peter had
[1:32:53] it in in him though you don't understand
[1:32:56] love that doesn't mean you don't have it
[1:32:59] in you cuz that's the Holy Ghost within
[1:33:01] you that loves people so God knows
[1:33:03] you've got that love he's just going to
[1:33:05] send you a couple of Trials which you
[1:33:06] will miserably fail so that you can get
[1:33:10] Revelation so that you would understand
[1:33:12] that you're not you have a deeper love
[1:33:15] because when Peter failed he knew he
[1:33:17] didn't have that love at least he knew
[1:33:19] what he didn't
[1:33:21] have but then Jesus came his way
[1:33:24] and he says you throw that knet on the
[1:33:27] right hand side of the boat man and they
[1:33:28] hold fishes and it says and a disciple
[1:33:31] that loved God said to Peter it is the
[1:33:34] Messiah and Peter this is what the Bible
[1:33:37] says you go read it John 211 to1 17 okay
[1:33:41] go listen to this again you need it GS
[1:33:44] himself CU he was naked jumps in the
[1:33:47] water so he puts on a coat to
[1:33:51] swim why would you want to take close
[1:33:54] off to go
[1:33:55] swim see what I mean here he knew he was
[1:33:58] approaching Messiah he knew he was going
[1:34:01] to God so the very thing he did is he
[1:34:03] made himself decent and then he jumped
[1:34:05] in the water where I thought he would
[1:34:07] throw the coat off and then jump in
[1:34:08] because it's going to be dead way
[1:34:10] dragging it into the shore and the boat
[1:34:12] followed him that man was paddling Coten
[1:34:15] oil but he was dressed right and he was
[1:34:17] so desperate then to get to God because
[1:34:20] the motive behind it is I can see him I
[1:34:24] can fix this you didn't have to fix this
[1:34:28] but still his motive was I can fix this
[1:34:30] I got another chance that's your chance
[1:34:33] and then Jesus says to him he says hey
[1:34:35] Peter do you love me and Peter of course
[1:34:39] very quick on the trigger goes yeah Lord
[1:34:41] I love you and he says feed my
[1:34:44] lambs and then Peter goes on and he
[1:34:47] thought man I just redeemed myself there
[1:34:48] and he goes hey Peter yeah do you love
[1:34:51] me and he goes yeah of course Lord I
[1:34:54] love you I love you he says feed my
[1:34:58] sheep it says here in the third time he
[1:35:00] says he says Peter do you love me he
[1:35:04] says Lord you knowest all things you
[1:35:06] know I love you now that love was a
[1:35:10] different love that was a agapo love
[1:35:13] because he said the word knows all
[1:35:15] things and I love you I love the word I
[1:35:18] love everything that you give me now he
[1:35:22] said go and feed my sheep now Jesus
[1:35:25] wanted to teach him something and say
[1:35:26] listen before you quickly say you love a
[1:35:29] brother and a sister before you quickly
[1:35:31] say you love one another or you love
[1:35:34] me do you really love
[1:35:37] me and if you would leave love me you
[1:35:40] will believe my
[1:35:43] word very very
[1:35:45] easy amen musicians you can come
[1:35:48] forward I will bring this back with this
[1:35:51] last
[1:35:51] slide and it is 9 o00 on the dot so
[1:35:55] sorry I took a little bit longer but it
[1:35:56] was a you shouldn't let me bring slides
[1:35:58] cuz then I go too long hey I'll just
[1:36:00] stop with slides it says love should
[1:36:03] govern a
[1:36:04] home so brothers
[1:36:07] sisters all of you love should govern a
[1:36:11] home love is the greatest force that was
[1:36:14] ever put in the power of
[1:36:17] man listen to what the prophet says it
[1:36:21] was the greatest force that ever was put
[1:36:23] into the power of man so you have a
[1:36:27] power you have a force within you that
[1:36:30] is so strong that it could it could
[1:36:33] break a nuclear bomb heading your
[1:36:36] way there was a the there was a a maniac
[1:36:39] that went to Brother brandham to go and
[1:36:41] punch his lights
[1:36:42] out because he didn't agree with pastors
[1:36:45] and he was and he already you all know
[1:36:46] the story but I'll just tell you anyways
[1:36:48] and there was already a a slogan on this
[1:36:50] guy he punches preachers out when they
[1:36:52] preach brother brandham saw this man
[1:36:55] coming out and this man said I will Te
[1:36:56] You limb from limb and brother brandham
[1:36:59] used to be a boxer and he could easily
[1:37:01] go into the love the F of love and lose
[1:37:04] his calm and knock that guy back cuz
[1:37:07] brother brandom could
[1:37:08] box but he looked at the man and divine
[1:37:12] love started projecting and he says he's
[1:37:15] got a
[1:37:16] family that's a man just like any of us
[1:37:19] and this man got so angry and he ran up
[1:37:22] to go and hit the prophet and the Lord
[1:37:24] stepped in and he said today you'll fall
[1:37:26] at my feet and that man fell at the feet
[1:37:29] of brother
[1:37:30] brandom wasn't God doing the brother bam
[1:37:33] doing the fighting it was God standing
[1:37:35] for his word standing for his
[1:37:37] Prophet but the prophet did not act out
[1:37:41] of that way the prophet act out of love
[1:37:44] divine love CU I believe truly he did
[1:37:46] believe that man and he did love that
[1:37:49] man that man just loved that Spirit more
[1:37:51] than him Jesus Christ
[1:37:55] it g goes a home that is not disciplined
[1:37:58] by love is not much of a
[1:38:01] home if a husband and a wife doesn't
[1:38:04] solemnly love each other they cannot
[1:38:06] trust each
[1:38:08] other that is why I think instead of
[1:38:10] resting upon faith upon some emotion or
[1:38:14] some gift like shouting and speaking in
[1:38:17] tongues like that sister that was
[1:38:19] sincerely playing piano she just did not
[1:38:22] love the Lord yet with aapo loves she
[1:38:24] was still a
[1:38:27] babe is there all other things that we
[1:38:30] take for saying that we have the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit when we do this those things are
[1:38:35] all right but if you come back to the
[1:38:37] principle loved
[1:38:39] first and then those things I think our
[1:38:43] church would progress a lot faster if we
[1:38:45] could get God first and God is
[1:38:50] love so at the end of the day it is is
[1:38:53] the Lord Jesus Christ doing all the
[1:38:56] work but how we
[1:38:59] choose how we choose to react to one
[1:39:03] another could uh seal the deal or it
[1:39:07] could break the deal could bring a world
[1:39:10] of of hurt or it could bring a world of
[1:39:14] healing so I hope this encourage you I I
[1:39:16] don't really like doing it always this
[1:39:19] way with slides because it kind of
[1:39:20] limits me to having to follow a a slide
[1:39:25] show Dads love your sons love your
[1:39:30] daughters
[1:39:32] Sons respect your
[1:39:34] dads honor
[1:39:37] them you can love them later when you
[1:39:39] have children and you realize what true
[1:39:41] love is when you're young you don't know
[1:39:43] love you don't as much as you say it you
[1:39:47] have no revelation of what love means
[1:39:50] until your child stands before you one
[1:39:52] day you will know what love
[1:39:55] is but still honor them and respect them
[1:39:58] and
[1:39:59] husbands your job is to look after your
[1:40:03] wife because it's God husband wife
[1:40:08] children don't forget that and wives
