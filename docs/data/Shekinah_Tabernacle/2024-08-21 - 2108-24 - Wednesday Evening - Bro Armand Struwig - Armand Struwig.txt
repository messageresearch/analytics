and the word is open sin is broken and you have won for me amen and amen great King Jesus wanted all for us we didn't deserve it we didn't even think we were in the in the picture but then God brought us in the picture amen we're going to um just quickly open up with a word of pray but we want to remember um sister Joyce she's in the hospital with a blood CL clot in her lung you saw that on the brothers and sisters I do believe there's more of us here and if the Lord is with any one of you and inside of you then there's more power in this room to move this Earth Hall amen if if one person can speak a world into existence and brother brandom said you can do that and you can go live on that world if you really want to but see if that faith is here tonight what is impossible for God so let us just bow our heads and let open up in a word of prayer if you have a need tonight bring it before the Lord he sees every need even before you even realized you had the need he knew it was there so he sees everything he knows everything you don't have to worry he is here so let's just bow our heads and raise up your hand lift up your hand to the King of Kings defy gravity say our lord Jesus we have needs Lord we see sister Joyce right now Lord as in hospital father Lord and we cannot be there right now because we Believers Lord we know if we were there we would just lay our hands upon the sick and they shall recover cuz that's your commission that's your promise for us Lord and Faith obtains every promise Lord and we know Lord that by Faith Lord Jesus we can Touch the Hem of your garment Lord in your promises the key of the whole Bible Lord to unlock it is that you're yesterday today and forever the same Lord Lord you cannot change Lord so it's the same recipe for us as Believers father even in the ones that came before us Lord if we believe and we speak to this mountain and it shall be removed Lord father we believe and we come Lord and just want to say we've got a sister in hospital we still have Brother full mending up Lord Jesus each one of us has a need with an uplifted hand father we ask to come our way Lord Lord Jesus just come by our way Lord and Lord we know if you were here you wouldn't even be able to heal us because you've already done it but Lord just encourage our faith strengthen it Lord and give us such a such a a a resolve in your word to know that you can do it father and if we have unbelief we ask that you would bring it to the surface so it can be exposed so you can get rid of it Lord cuz we want nothing between us and you we want nothing to hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit Lord so Lord we come tonight Lord and say help our unbelief Lord we want to say strengthen our faith Lord give us a greater measure of it Lord Lord give us a greater measure of you tonight lord it's Wednesday night it's cold outside father but once more we have gathered to a place Lord we we can give you preeminence because we only came here for you Lord so please would you just take this evening Lord into your hands Lord may you just anoint speaker and hearer Lord May the words be your words words of eternal life Lord l words that bring life Lord Jesus and that would just give a new birth father and give strength and courage to those that need it Lord Lord you said that my yoke oh Lord it is easy and my burden it is so light if you can just take my yoke upon you oh Lord may we just sell out Lord and take your yoke upon us tonight Lord father and just help us by the grace of God to walk in the pages of Time Lord in the pages of your word father and just teach us your way we pray this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen well brother Jimmy he took my line where's brother Jimmy he took my line he said well you made it it's Wednesday you're here you made it so brother Jimmy that's copyrighted hey okay we're all cont musicians thank you very much so you going hand of Applause for them here's a reason we do that don't don't ever think that this job is an easy job David had no easy job when he was looking after Saul with his heart so sometimes these magicians come in and they have a great battle of their own a whole day they had to fight all their battles and then they have to all surrender that to the side and play some good music so that we can come a little bit closer to God it is an absolute gift and God uses it bless you all for doing that don't think it strange that these musicians they are gifts of God placed in Obits amen so let let's go there to the Book of Matthew Matthew 23 and we're only going to read verse 11 and verse 12 so I promised the Lord I said I'll make as many notes as I can but I promise I won't look at them I think if you've done everything you can then the Lord has to do now the rest so you just pray for me and uh if there's any Pips there in the pie don't stop eating the pie just keep eating the pie eh I don't think there would be but keep eating the apple pie Matthew 23 verse 11 it says but he that is great among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted may the Lord just add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we're also going to turn the to the book of uh I'm just going to get it man this is a tongue twister I practice it this afternoon Thessalonians is that right the book of Thessalonians in Africans we say tessens is it NE yeah so that's a bit of a tongue twister so trying to do that and thinking Africans say it in English it just sometimes don't happen we're going to go to there to verse four 1 Thessalonians 4 and we're going to go there to verses 14 please how are you all feeling tonight amen don't fall asleep on I'll make it short and sweet and hopefully we can just uh give the devil a couple of punches because the thing is we're at War here and there's a battle ranging and you can decide which team you're on so if you're feeling you're falling asleep I'm telling you the enem is winning so just pull harder I always tell you the story and I'm going to say it many a times there's a big lake of fire and the devil wants to pull you inside there and it's a big tug of wall and you're on the one side and he's on the other side he's pulling as hard as he can to tonight but guess what if you start pulling as well and you take some of the word you'll put him in there that's his place that's where he's going to end up so if you pull you'll receive don't don't want to end up in the Lake of Fire for whatever reason so we're going to start then and it says thereby verse 14 my title for tonight is the missing puzzle piece for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them that also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him so remember Saints don't die we just sleep yeah okay don't sleep on the job go rest but while we're here we fight okay when we get up there we rest okay amen amen can I add amen for that amen so while this day let's let's make some hey hey for this we say unto you that the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen and then they which are alive will remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be forever with the Lord can I get an aen amen there amen so that's your scripture that's my scripture that's when the the message of the hour was released upon this Earth I never understood that scripture because it never actually spoke about me it was just some saints that's going to become alive again yeah but when the prophet came and he preached all the sermons that he's preached for us everything that he's given us he opened the book that scripture became more and more my scripture because before that I didn't know if it was going to be a Jew or if it was going to be a gentile or is it going to be is this just a is it a is it a physical going up in the clouds and you're trying to work it out by mind but and all the scholars everybody has their own opinion on it so we really did need a prophet just say this is going to happen just like the Bible says the wonderful thing about the word Prophet is it brings us back into the word oh yes okay because he will not take us away from the word he will not add to the word he will just say it as it is but makes the word du tail he makes the word come together and that's what the gift was that God sent him is to bring the word together now we all here together this is your scripture brother Ben said it so nicely everyone will fulfill their scripture for their day this is your scripture I I want you to realize there's people that going to walk off the face of the Earth this is your scripture see don't worry about the news don't worry about agendas don't worry about your next meeting just remember this is your scripture you don't have to figure it out you don't have to work it out Enoch didn't work that way he just knew that this if it was said in Africans or it was said in English or it was said in Su perana whatever this was his scripture and he lived for that scripture but it's not just your scripture I want you to think of it this is not just everybody in this place of scripture because there's many out there still that needs to fulfill the scripture cuz if all of us fulfilled the scripture guess what we wouldn't be here when the bride is ready and in a position we would be up there so there's still a little bit of work to do isn't there amen or else if if if the word was fulfilled and the Lord brought the last one in then we should be walking the Trump should sound the grave should open we should be having a jubilee with all the saints of old we know things were happening but because it's not happening it means there's still something going on and there's still a responsibility there is still a missing puzzle piece amen amen so Job 38 God goes and speaks to job and job you know he went through a lot of Trials and and God bless him you know like he really he went through the ringer and just before he really felt sorry for himself and he started rehearsing the word of God and just thinking about these things because that's what we do when things go really hard we start thinking about scriptures we start thinking about Lord what what can I get from this I I don't want to be in this trial too long but while I'm here what are you trying to tell me there's something that's happening you need to talk to me Lord and then he says to to job and you can go Job 38 verse three just go with me there cuz I read really badly and you check up if I'm doing it right okay you can be the teacher tonight Talia you can put that up he says G up now thy loins like a man [Laughter] so God comes to jeah and goes shape up bro come on wake up G yourself up you know you like we feel sorry for ourselves but there's a time where the Lord just wants to go can you just shake yourself off can you just get beside yourself there's a greater purpose here and we so on a pretty party and we feel so bad but all God wants to tell you is I want you to step out of this trial for a second I want you to come up a little bit higher yeah I need to talk to you but when you come up higher don't feel sorry for yourself because then you're still in the previous state you've been in when you come up higher let's just get it all tucked in and stand U right Andress me like a man because when I'm going to talk to you is going to be for the edifying of your and my body because remember we're all the body of Christ and sometimes he gets you attention because he wants a one-on-one conversation with you to say Shape Up amen okay and he speaks here to to um job not that job did anything wrong but just remember he was in a really bad State and and he he was went through trials but God says stop feeling sorry for yourself I want to remind you of something and we carry on he says and answer thou me so now he's asking you should talk to me he says where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare so he's respecting a response now here this is this is hard questions you know now think about you in the trial don't just think about Paul o Joe put you in his choose we fulfill scripture and some days you're going to walk in this part of the scripture and this is going to be your portion and it is hard to walk there when because job walked there because it's a testimony for you so it can help you in that time but you're walking in that scripture God's asking you now hey declare unto me okay where were you when I formed the foundation of the earth so when God says you're going to come back to me in the Rapture God's also telling you you were there before before the Rapture even began so he's telling job and he's taking him now outside of time outside of what we know is time and he's taking him into the internal realm and he says before all this time began Before Time even began where were you so if you believe you're going to fulfill first Thessalonians then you should also believe you already fulfilled this part where were thou when I formed the foundations of the Earth because he asking job a very serious questions the sons of God the stars of gods were shouting for joy and rejoicing where were you so he's taking him out of time can you step out of your time and walk with God or are we so time bound that God cannot do anything in our life Lord help us Lord because when we time bound we can't wait for an answer when we time bound when we on our knees it takes too long to pray when we time bound and our sons and daughters are doing something silly we can't wait for them to stop it because we want to go on with our normal life but see we're not time bound I want you to realize this we are in time but we are not time bound we are Eternal beings amen you have a theophany keeps clocking on that's your home with God he says Heaven is my heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol but where's the place of my rest that's in The Believer Hallelujah so so we're inti just because God wants to express his Plan of Redemption in US you all follow me so you got put in time because God has a plan for you you didn't get put in time because you just happened to be in time so remember the author that says you're coming in a Rapture is the author that says where were you when the foundations were formed Hallelujah in God part of God lord so his promise for us is that I will not leave you so in the book of Isaiah 493 he says Sing oh heavens and be ye joyful o Earth and Break Forth into singing oh Mountains for the Lord have comforted his people and he will have mercy upon his afflicted that's his promise he says but the very next verse says but Zion yeah but Zion said the Lord ha forsaken me the Lord have forgotten me so we represent Zion we are the bride of Christ and sometimes you're in a trial and it feels like God has forgotten about you God has forsaken you but see God didn't say that just go one back there Italia he said sing oh heavens Break Forth and be joyful oh Earth break into singing oh Mountains and the Lord has comforted his people and he has mercy upon his afflicted yeah full stop so no matter where you find yourself that is God's promise to you he says don't worry about just keep singing amen just keep rejoicing it's not about the trial I know what's going on you can go on the next verse Lord so Zion complains next one he says can a woman forget her suckling child that she would not have compassion on a son of her womb yay they may forget a mother might forget her son but I will not forget thee Hallelujah you I'm so mindful of your situation I just want to say I cannot forget you next one sister Talia he says behold I have Graven thee on the palms of my hand that's why I died so that you can remember that I'm thinking of you amen it's not just to cover sin that's great he struck sin off that's all but it's not just hey I forgot your sin and there we go that's it you know like a coldhearted husband yeah okay I forgot your sin and so just shape up he says hold on I haven't forgotten you am I still have a relationship with you we're still walking here in the pages of my word I didn't just die for you and you're now a Christian and now you go to heaven there's something more to come amen amen so uh Liam can you bring me that little thing there from behind I'm going to show you something this is for the kids oh man you made me bend down after being Bailey at me working for him that's rough God bless you brother vid he's a hot man you know when you you think you need saloa 45 I think I needed two of those I needed saloa 90 because it

answer raise your hands Davy who's missing say it nice and Loud for the promises unto you and to your children and that are far off as many as many as the Lord Our God shall call so whose work is to to fill this sheet in whose work is to do the puzzle it's God's work but whose work is to check that they're in the puzzle it's our work because what happened when I gave this to the youth and I want to explain to you something little ones I started writing the names on the board and I forgot Mo's name totally forgot Mo's name not on purpose I actually forgot Mo's name and I was writing all the names on the board and it was Sunday school and you know and ab stopped and he goes where's Mo I said man that's so good because you are your brother's keeper amen and mo wouldn't have been there and got onto that name if nobody called that name okay follow me we're still going that was the that was the nice part so in the church we have gifts of and callings and the gifts and callings is a couple of things but we've got deacons which is now let's say we've got positions in the church and it's deacons and and we've got uh trustees Sunday school superintendent Sunday school teachers then we've got the treasurer then we got the edifying of the body the cooks they make us food the cleaners the musos these these different people that's just bringing all their they gifting and doing it naturally and doing it really good and God anoints those gifts for the edifying of the Body for the helping of the body but that's just us being the body of Christ together then we've got the fivefold ministry who knows who's the fivefold ministry pastors teachers evangelists prophets Apostles okay those are ordained men of God they're not gifts there are men that God plac in that position it's a Ministry and those ones are also like brother brandham said and I'll read you the quote now for the edifying of the body and he gives them to us to help us to guide our way through this PL because the whole body is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ cannot go in a Rapture and take his body and fulfill your scripture if the last part of his body is not there now follow me I've got to a point I'm getting there then in there there's spiritual gifts spiritual gifts where the Lord sends the spirit and the spirit of the Lord manifests through different gifts like wisdom there's nine spiritual gifts who can name them who knows you about wisdom discern discernment prophecy I'll help you go to 1 Corinthians 12 this is a little bit of Sunday school but go there cuz you need to understand where these things happen and and where they lie and if you understand where these gifts lie then we understand that those gifts are for you and God uses the gifts but you have to surrender that gift hey AB you have to surrender that gift because God cannot use you if you're not a perfect mute if you're not a mic so you might have a real good of music but that doesn't mean you're using it for God you might be playing in the church but that doesn't mean you're using it for God it's just still a gift of music so songs though you know those those um musicians that when they sing they try to be Pitch Perfect all the time with this massive vocal range and they do have it that's a gift I try that I will fall apart it's a gift and it's for the body of Christ but if you use your gift for lifting yourself up God cannot use you because it's for the body of Christ so we're all the body of Christ so your whole mentality should be Lord how are you going to use my gift to reach your people absolutely so it is a little bit of just bear with me we're coming to a point where it's very important that you surrender this gift fully to the Lord and while you do it yourself as well or else it's just a gift and gifts are calling us without repentance that means nothing but when you can surrender your gift and God can come and anoint that gift he can reach his seed he can reach the last puzzle piece which we're all looking for because we still sit here am so that means whoever needs to be there is still not there because we all still here so we're not here to have church we're here for the missing puzzle pieace amen so now we're there with the spiritual gifts look what it says in verse 7 1 Corinthians 12:7 it says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all the manifestation of the spirit so that means you're not a prophet you've got the gift of Prophecy but you might have multiple gifts and brother Brandon was going to say said I'll say it now he says you have multiple gifts some might have two some might have one some God might only use once and never again it is for God to manifest through that gift to reach his members Amen to get the hand to be where the hand is and the fingers to be the fingers because we're cutting with KN he says for one is given the spirit of the word of wisdom another the word of knowledge to the other faith and the spirit that gives the other one healing healing is a spiritual gift and it's not always just a physical healing it's a healing brother Ben has got that gift and God uses it through his life God bless you brother Ben because he's got a heart for the people and God can see the sincerity and he can use that and healing comes because when we were broken when we had to give all our rubbish which we had inside of us get it out we needed to go somewhere to get counseling to help us for healing and he put a pastor with that gift there he's not just a pastor there's a healing gift in him and my body didn't need healing but my body needed healing I needed healing amen so God will use that gift if you can surrender that gift to the Lord amen so you come to church every Sunday and you think why am I here why does nothing happen ever it's your fault it's your fault you're not surrendering your gift you're majoring on a minor God wants to use your discernment but when it comes to using it you shy away because oh maybe somebody says something you are limiting God from using you as a vessel to reach his P bride they must be the last puzzle piece could be sitting here right here tonight and God wants to speak in tongues and corrects them and he wants to interpreter but you're to scare to step out of your bubble because what if the guy next to me says something you have a gift God has placed it here for the edifying of his body amen not to keep for yourself so we as as as brothers and sisters must realize the person next to you is just if not more important than you because remember what we said in Matthew you be his servant and if you realize that a brother can say something under inspiration to you at the right time and God could break that thing amen but if you think about that guy anything outside of a tool in God's hand hands a weapon in God's hands you have belittled him and his gift is worth nothing so remember there's a reason there's gifts there's we've got the ministry and everybody always looks at the prophets and the teachers and the and all the big things what about the gifts in our church what's going on here shakina what's going on here are we really using our gifts for for God and it's not I'm not fighting with you it dawned on me when I did this I thought Lord am I actually digging in deep and saying Lord whatever you want to do you do it through me I Surrender it all are we that serious about God's kingdom are we that serious about going home cuz I want to fulfill that first Rapture I want to ful first scripture I want to go in the Rapture he says then as well then then there's tongues and interpretation healing he says prophecy Discerning tongues interpretation but all these work that one and the same self Spirit which is God dividing to every man um severely as he will for as the body is one he has made members and all the members of one body being many are one body also as Christ is or also is Christ so guess what the guy sitting next to you that you think he ain't going to make it God can use him more than you but guess what if he's the puny and we've got the rest of the body here you can't leave without the CU God ain't going to leave any of his body behind so when you can see him as God's body as someone that that is a part of God without the circumstance right now then you can win him for Christ amen I'm about to close don't worry I don't want I don't want to go too long Luke 18 there was a certain blind man and I want to speak about this quickly go into you you don't have to go into your bibles if you want but Luke 18 so Jesus comes to comes to [Music] um he's on his way there to Jericho and uh you know there where Jesus goes we there at verse um so Luke 18 and we pretty much there at verse 35 if you want to follow in what I'm say so he comes to Jericho and there's this blind man that's there at the at the gate and he's asking for for arms okay so it says and it came to pass that he was Come N to Jericho a certain blind man sat there by the way begging and hearing the multitude passed by he asked what it meant now you're sitting at school now you think why would I go here you're sitting at school there's a blind guy coming your way but you just had an awesome Sunday and you're buzzing and you're happy and he goes to you why are you happy why are you different what is the difference between this blind man that cannot see the light of his day to the guy at your school at your workers asking why are you happy cuz we're talking now about the gifts we're talking about God placing you in a body but the body is here but the body should be moving together in unison so that we can get forward momentum so that we can re that last one because without him the puzzle piece is not complete we as a body is worth nothing no matter how good you sing No matter how good you preach you're actually currently with nothing until we get the last one and then we can fulfill our scripture the picture is complete then we can go home isn't that the whole purpose so this man is asking what what's going on hearing the multitudes and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by I went to camp and the Lord got me at camp and he saved my soul amen and he brought my wife in am you know what I believe a message that has life I saw sick healed am I saw cripples get healed I saw blind people I heard the gospel being preached the word being open man come and see amen come and see cuz there's there's desperate people out there that wants this word that God is sending you to preach this word and you don't have to preach to them share your testimony tell them how you candle god letter but do something it's not about Works you're not going to work your way we're not seven day Adventists here you're not working your yourself into heaven amen but man you found Grace in the sight and your friends are asking you why are you different amen and if you're not different then I was saying your friends are asking you why you not different why you just like the other guys you know these guys that ask my son the one day they said to him why are you not like that one that goes to the CH he's a Christian too yeah you should just say to them come and see Jesus has passed me by amen amen and we go on he says and he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy upon me because remember this guy was blind he can't help himself to follow Jesus wherever he's going but he his testimony of those multitudes says Jesus is coming by and he would have heard many of stories about Jesus before many of children testifying that hey in our church we don't just fall asleep man God moves in my church when when when God comes in we sing and we worship and we allowed to lift our hands and we allowed to dance to the left and we right and dance to the left your left we are allowed to do that we can do whatever we want in the in the order of church under the holy spirit's anointing we're not dead we're not formal we're not some dead bones that brother Isaac wrote about he's the ones that come alive come and see man amen but but but what happens is when we get out in the in the world we kind of forgot our identity we forgot our purpose we forget why we're here we forget that we're not just a church member we're a body and if we're all here tonight where's the rest so testify talk to them share the goodness of God if brother Colin and 100 times you tell someone that and they still don't believe you just keep telling it you're doing a good job CU God's using you as a witness and there will be a hung blind man looking for Christ that would call out where's that Christ and he'll come and see and it says and when they went before him the people rebuked him they say a come on man the message of the hour is just a bunch of nonsense days of Miracles are passed it's just a they're all looking to a man Moses was a Man Too Elijah was a man too Daniel was a Man Too Paul was a Man Too yes I'm looking to a man but it was more than a man it was an anointed man for his time no man spoke like this man and I believe you when Paul started preaching and you were under Paul's Ministry you would have gone no man speaks like that man amen he doesn't even sound like the Pharisees but he used to be one yeah used to be all Pious and great no man spoke like this man and I can only tell you by the re Revelation that God gave me that this message has overcoming power why cuz it works amen I'm overcoming every day the things I used to do that was that that that col sister that said I ain't I ain't what I want to be and I ain't what I ought to be but thank God I ain't what I used to be but every time I walk with God and every tape I listen and every sermon I'm here I just keep eating and pulling and I just keep growing and growing and Faith just takes a hold and God just gets bigger in my life because why this message works because it's not introducing me to a man it introducing me to the man of Jesus Christ the person of the holy spirit because remember we're one body so whose body is this I'm asking you whose body William brandom body of who Jesus Christ so what did William bradam do he surrendered his life and all his gifts the gift of prophecy the gift of bringing it all and being a major prophet surrendering himself to God and saying Lord use me to reach your bride and he did that and then from there on God moved him off the scene and now he's dealing with us and he says if you have any doubt about any Scripture which all the other guyses and theologians don't even know about and think they know about just listen to the message I got some good food in due season for you that would help you overcome but I find that we we don't overcome because we don't spend time in the world we don't spend time in the message and don't take it back to the word and then we forget our purpose and all of a sudden we go why are we not fulfilling first Thessalonians 4 why am I not walking like Enoch because we're seeing it but why am I not doing it well because we're not doing our job we're not doing our job we got so used to be under a under this this a brother Ben said it's so nice he likes preaching where the rubber hits the road we we have so many quotes and so many things that we say but we have no life I'm being honest because if you had the life and a blind man walk past you or a kid at school would say hey what's going on you would say come and see but you would compel him to come and see because you know that Jesus has the answer he's done it for Blind Men before he can do it for you amen and this blind man after the people rebuked him and told him how bad the message was he screw out oven more he said Jesus oh son of David have mercy upon me amen cuz he wanted to be have mercy on how many times should your friends ask you about God how many times how many they desperate to know him and all you do is you keep quiet because you're scared what would happen to you but then Jesus walks and he hears this man and he stands still he says and he stood and he said bring that man to me see now something happened you said come and see your friend walks in here and he comes and sits down or your person at work and God is in his channel that day and he's preaching and he's knocking on his door see Zaki has come out the tree cuz that just happened after that tonight I'm going to dine at your house and stuff got real for zakus because zakus just wanted to see God he really wanted to see God it was pressed upon his heart but this bind man SC and Jesus goes to the blind man and he says to him what would you want what would you want want me to do for you and he says I just want back my sight he says what Willl thou that I shall do unto thee and he said Lord that I might receive my sight that this veil of tradition this this doctrines of man the word of a Preacher the the depression the things that's keeping me away from your word from your joy the things that people might tell us that oh days of Miracles are over see the the the one thing about denomination is it it made sure it tried to bury Christ with my opinion a second opinion a third opinion they got a whole book of opinions but they don't have the Living Word and when you start quoting The Living Word they tell you those words weren't inspired they do oh oh that's not that's not because in the Old Testament they did it this way and they hide it behind words but they don't want to take everything and here I'm saying in front of you Jesus of Nazareth have passed through that voice that came that he spoke of that was brother Brenham that shout was the angel that came down there was the ministry this is this message going forth we spoke to it on the ministers meeting that's the message that went forth that's a shout getting the bride ready so remember with the five foolish and the five wise versions there was a shout when that case is the bridegroom cometh get ready they was a shout that's brother brenham's Ministry then the voice of God is the one in Revelation 10:7 that is making the mysteries of god good and it's coming now and can we turn off the heat here as well a bit because it's pretty hot brother ID and that voice came back don't worry everything's fine The Voice came and that voice is speaking to you every day that voice is leading you and guiding you and before that voice will get you into a place where you can get that Trump and you can and the dead will rise and we will go back to Glory so just remember that but what you need to remember is the blind man is asking where is the Lord your blind friends and your blind family and blind everyone is asking where's Jesus I want to see and all I'm asking you is are you taking those conversations serious enough to know that that might be the last missing puzzle piece that will add to us so we can go home does it make sense I know it was a little bit all over I was trying to just get the two thoughts together blind man got there because someone turned around and says Jesus is passing by he didn't start testifying how good Jesus were he just said Jesus is passing by and that was all that that blind man had to see because he had enough scripture and enough gumption in him to know that if I can reach that man I can shout out to that man he'll hear me he will heal me so it's not a rebuke and it's not a fight because we don't want to come here for that I just want to remind you where's the last puzzle piece cuz we need to go home amenallah so I I will encourage you I got something to finish with so you don't all think I just made a gave you a pxl CU that's not what it's about yeah yeah there's a song that that a artist wrote and I think it's Casting Crowns and it says city on a hill and it says each one thought they knew better but they were different by Design instead of standing stronger together they let their differences divide what happened with these people he says they all made up their minds and they left it all behind they walked away they were sitting in church and they thought the guy next to him wasn't that gift that God could use and God's saying I want to prophesy he's saying I want to sing I want to dance I want to have knowledge and discernment and ab and or them shouldn't jump in the river somebody said don't jump in that over the waters too fast and all those things there's gifts in our church that God is warning and want to use but we're holding behind because we're not staying in his word and we're not fortified behind his word and God can only use you when you surrendered and how do you surrender I leave it with this how do you surrender you say Lord I'm sold out I have no will of my own I want your will just work through me I want to get that last one and then when you're at school and you walk into class the very first thing that's in your mind is who's the last one how can you help me Lord to reach that last one it's not a it's not a tool it's because you want to do it you don't have to do it you want to do it let me finish musicians you can come up it is quite hot up here leave over he says the trouble of it brother brandom Cy and zachi as the businessman and that's actually where it all came from is trouble of this is today we're not thirsty enough there is not enough thirst and hunger for the people I believe the church ought to be a little bit more saltier than what it is salt creates a thirst salt is a savior and it contacts but if the salt has lost its savior it's hence for no good for nothing and to become an organization that that's right but you got a little bit of savor in it and the Savor of the salt gives it its strength back he says if a man sees Christ Living in you it will make him thirst to be like you it will make him see Jesus in you it will make him see God so the puzzle piece is are they figuring out that they the last puzzle piece and are you figuring out that they the last puzzle piece do you treat them like the missing one and if you do you will come humbly behind and say Lord show me let me be a servant so that I can lift them into your presence so that they can meet you so that we all can become servants amen we can all just stand up there um brother Jimmy you can come forward too I I don't like I didn't preach it because I wanted to preach something strong I want you to realize that if we got used to just being us for no more then uh we're not going home that's the truth of it brother Jimmy and if you do find my puzzle pieces anyway please um just give it to Sister Chantel so we're just going to close quickly in a word of prayer can you see um play hide me now then hide me now okay amen bow your heads we just end in a word of prayer say Lord Jesus be before we going to sing tonight Lord uh I love you Lord and uh I know there's a lot of blind people out there Lord that's really just looking for you my lord and uh we sometimes get so busy with life that we forget to talk to those blind people we forget to to tell them what you have done in our life Lord Jesus you we forget to testify and say hey but God rich and mercy came my way one day and he and he saved me come and see we kind of get too scared of our religion we kind of get too ashamed of you Lord we can't pray for our our meal Lord and and we think that if we around people and we have to display some form of religion Lord that they would just rebuke us or they would make fun of us father but that Lord that shouldn't be the case Lord we should really just say Lord thank you for everything you do for us Lord because how would the blind man be able to see one day if nobody told him about you how would the lame be able to find strength if there's no testimony or witness Lord to go to and say hey I'm a bit lame I need help introduce me to Jesus how would the the ones with depression Lord Jesus get over it if there's nobody to go to them and say hey but I used to be depressed one day Lord how is that Miss puzzle piece going to come in father if the bride is just happy with where she's sitting tonight in her place all happy but forgetting Lord that there's one missing Lord and they're looking at the ones missing and everybody can see the ones missing but there's nothing that's being done to catch that one there's nothing that's being done to serve the one that needs the love and the help Father I ask that you would forgive us for this Lord because that's not why we're here Lord we're here because we love you and we want to Worship You Lord and we want to tell everybody about you father because the the change in our life we can see is so major lord it's so big father that we never walk the same way Lord when we wrestled with you the angel of the lord we wrestled Lord you touched us and we walked different but Lord sometimes we trying to hide the limp because we're scared we get told off or we get rebuked but Lord I ask that you would just help us Lord to to keep looking for that last puzzle piece Lord to keep pushing the battle Lord and pressing on Lord to look at each other in the Pew not like hey Lord work in his life but actually say Lord how can you use me to work in his life father to instead of saying oh I'm glad I'm not like this man to say Lord how can I help this man Lord Jesus change our attitude please father and the way we do things Lord so that we would be so mindful of and be used by you Lord and inspired in such a way Lord that we could speak a word in season father I know you've got many your gifts in this church itself father and they're laying dormant Lord because we're not surrendering them to you father I pray Lord that you would just help us and forgive us if we have Lord and help us to Le these gifts being on display Lord that you could work through US Lord not worrying about what the neighbor sees Lord but asking what you want us to do the will of the father Lord Jesus I ask that you would forgive us Lord just being so hard and cold and starchy some days and get used to rby and netball and cricket and all these other things that keeps us busy and running after our children but not running after the elected the ones that's there Lord father this world has got a great program to keep us busy Lord but we ask that you would remove that from our minds right now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord and that you would give us the purpose Lord to go preach this gospel and live this gospel and represent this gospel with every fiber of our beings Lord because Lord that's what we want to do is we want to represent this message with all of our fibers Lord this introduction to the living God Lord that gave us overcoming power the spoken word returned to man Lord let us not be busy with other things father I pray you'll forgive us if we was but I ask tonight Lord that you would just come once more Lord and just clean all those other things away Lord Lord and you just Minister unto us and give us strength again to to give us that uh how do they say it Lord that gunion Lord just that strength that that uh oh there was now a word I was looking Lord that we're just not scared we got a boldness Lord to go out and represent this Kingdom and Lord we love you and we thank you for tonight I'm I'm sorry the words don't always come out as nice Lord you know that but I know Lord that you have made a point tonight that we can do better for you Lord and we can work harder for you Lord because not we have to but because we want to and I pray you'll help us and guide us give us utterance Lord give us speech in the right place to touch our friends there's many are sick and Afflicted around us there's many people dying there's many families broken Lord oh father let us just tell them to come and see Lord come and see come and see Jesus Christ is still alive come and see that he's passing by Stokes Valley come and see that he's passing by your door tonight oh Lord just come let them see you father cuz Lord zakus saw you from out that oh that sore tree Lord oh juniper tree or whatever it was was Lord see he looked down and he saw you such small stature and he saw him but when he saw you you saw him before he did that you called his name father and he was never the same he jumped out for Joy Lord and He you went and went to his house and Lord he said everything I'll fix Lord every mistake I did I'll fix Lord whoever I made a wrong deal with I'll pay him double years back lord he was so happy about it Lord because he finally found the source of life life the one thing we all living for you so I pray Lord Jesus that you would just do that for us Lord clean the slate and if we ever done it wrong to anyone Lord let us repay them and fix it all up father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen and [Music] amen God bless you I will so with you about the [Music] St father you are King over the FL I
