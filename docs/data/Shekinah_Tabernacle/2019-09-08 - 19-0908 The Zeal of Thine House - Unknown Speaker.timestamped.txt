[27:58] this morning
[27:59] amen hope you're blessed
[28:33] I was I was live streaming this morning
[28:37] Oh memorial service back home and for me
[28:47] it's it's been a tough couple of weeks
[28:50] because as a few you might remember it's
[28:55] this time of year again it's been two
[28:59] years very short time that's my brother
[29:05] went away he went home and for me it's
[29:14] one day and then the date is falling day
[29:17] at home and then on the Saturday we got
[29:22] the news of mr. Chappelle's grandpa and
[29:25] I know what it's like to not not be
[29:30] there and to miss to miss those
[29:33] important things and then on the Sunday
[29:39] night I got in my car after church and
[29:43] the first messages popping up on my
[29:47] phone that cousins dad passed away of a
[29:52] heart attack suddenly he went home and a
[30:00] few days later my friends and Flagstaff
[30:05] they lost their daughter charity there's
[30:10] no there's no answer is that we as
[30:14] humans can have when it doesn't seem to
[30:19] be just an explainable thing you know
[30:27] something seemed to be explainable car
[30:31] accidents and natural death and sickness
[30:35] you were already you were kind of ready
[30:37] you understood but a lot of things are
[30:40] unexplainable when I was listening this
[30:46] morning and whether Erin McGarry was
[30:50] taking the service I just really touched
[30:57] my heart
[31:03] and he said for us as Christians just
[31:09] there is no there is no premature death
[31:16] and I really believe that there is not
[31:24] one moment that Satan can steal from
[31:27] your life there's not one day that he
[31:33] can take you early said God has a
[31:39] purpose for your life when your purpose
[31:44] is over so precious in the sight of the
[31:50] Lord is the death this Saints thing and
[31:54] that Bible verse didn't give any reason
[31:58] why a death would not be precious when
[32:02] you're one of God's and that really just
[32:08] helped me this morning
[32:13] charity sisters sang this song and I I
[32:16] don't know the music so I'll just read
[32:19] you the words said I may have moments of
[32:26] unbelief but I don't let it worry me

[32:40] heart knows jesus loves me and washed my
[32:45] sins away I knew he will keep me
[32:52] [Music]
[32:54] no matter where my head is at I will not
[32:59] remove cuz my heart knows the truth
[33:09] Satan will whisper try to to see to make
[33:15] us doubt what we believe but we know
[33:20] better we have God's Word it's in my
[33:25] heart safe and sure my heart knows Jesus
[33:32] loves me and washed my sins away I know

[53:17] it's always good together
[53:18] I mean let's just read from I want to
[53:22] read from Isaiah 59 and and verse 16
[53:25] down to verse 21 we got three three
[53:27] places to to read this morning Isaiah 59
[53:35] and 16
[53:46] and he saw that there was no man and
[53:50] wondered that there was no intercessor
[53:52] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[53:54] him and his righteousness and sustained
[53:56] him for he put on righteousness as a
[53:59] breastplate and an helmet of salvation
[54:01] upon his head and he put on garments of
[54:04] vengeance for clothing and was clad with
[54:07] zeal as a cloak according to their deeds
[54:10] accordingly he will repay fury to his
[54:13] adversary's recompense to his enemies
[54:15] and to the islands will he pay
[54:17] recompense so shall they fear the name
[54:19] of the Lord from the West and and his
[54:22] glory from the rising of the Sun when
[54:24] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[54:26] Spirit of Lord shall raise up a standard
[54:28] against him and the Redeemer shall come
[54:31] to Zion and unto them that turned from
[54:33] transgressions and Jacob saith the Lord
[54:35] as for me this is my covenant with them
[54:37] saith the Lord my spirit that is upon me
[54:39] and my words which I've put in my mouth
[54:42] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[54:44] out of the mouth of thy seed there out
[54:47] of the mouth of thy seed seats at the
[54:49] Lord from henceforth and forever amen
[54:53] let's go to John 19 and we're gonna read
[54:56] a couple of verses here John 19 verses 4
[55:01] & 5
[55:12] and Pilate therefore went forth again
[55:16] and saith unto them behold I bring him
[55:19] forth to you that ye may know that I
[55:21] find no fault in him then came Jesus
[55:24] forth wearing the crown of thorns and
[55:26] purple robe and Pilate saith unto them
[55:29] behold the man let's go to John let's go
[55:33] back to John chapter two that's all I
[55:35] trust will will tied together as we as
[55:38] we journey on John 2 and verses 13 to 17
[55:49] and the Jewish Passover was at hand and
[55:53] Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in
[55:56] the temple those that sold oxen and
[55:57] sheep and doves and changes of money
[55:59] sitting and when he were when he had
[56:02] made a scourge of small cords he drove
[56:04] them out of it all out of the temple and
[56:07] the sheep and the oxen and poured out
[56:08] the changers money and overthrew the
[56:10] tables and seed under them that sold
[56:13] doves take these things hence make not
[56:15] my father's house a house of merchandise
[56:17] and his disciples remembered that it was
[56:20] written the zeal of thine house has
[56:23] eaten me up I mean this bear heads in a
[56:26] word of Prayer

[57:37] and father we just pray Lord that you

[57:41] in the service and Jesus Christ name
[57:43] Amen amen god bless you friends you may
[57:46] have your seats this morning I want to
[57:48] take I want to take that from that last
[57:50] Scripture we read the zeal of thine
[57:52] house has eaten me up now we read here
[57:56] that you know we read in Isaiah
[58:00] how-how-how there was no man those do
[58:02] wonder there's no intercessor yet and
[58:05] then so and then so here came this one
[58:07] he was he was you know he was he put on
[58:12] the breastplate as righteousness helmet
[58:14] of salvation upon his head and he put on
[58:16] the garments of vengeance for clothing
[58:18] and was clad with zeal as a cloak and
[58:21] when we read about here here when this
[58:24] when the scripture was was fulfilled I
[58:26] mean here was a man that Pilate was was
[58:29] trying to wash his hands worth and there
[58:31] he was standing and and he was he was
[58:34] robed in a purple robe oh really
[58:36] he was robed and zeal you know the cloak
[58:39] that he had Alma's ill and he was there
[58:41] to take care of his house I mean he
[58:44] wasn't worried about the political
[58:45] system he wasn't worried about what was
[58:48] going on but he was there for his
[58:49] household he is there to take care of
[58:51] his house I mean another word zeal in
[58:55] the in the scripture it means a it means
[58:59] that jealousy
[59:00] it means properly a heat something
[59:03] that's burning something that's got life
[59:05] it's got energy Amen it's not cold it's
[59:07] not it's not frozen it's not stuck it's
[59:10] it's burning it's living it's consuming
[59:12] I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a
[59:15] fervent mind it's a jealousy it's an
[59:17] again nation it's a zeal and that zeal
[59:20] ate them up and when something eats some
[59:23] someone up they can't control it it
[59:25] takes over their life it consumes them
[59:27] that your dominates the other word the
[59:29] word you're eating me up it means to eat
[59:31] up that is devour so the zeal of us
[59:34] house of that house ate
[59:36] but consumed to me couldn't you know he
[59:38] couldn't just sit back and watch what
[59:39] was going on it drove him you know it
[59:41] took over his thoughts his emotions
[59:44] everything
[59:44] his whole objective all of us everything
[59:47] he was doing it ate him up he couldn't
[59:49] contain it something who said something
[59:51] just yo just beat on their mind they
[59:52] can't rest until it's done I mean that
[59:55] was the kind of zeal I mean that he had
[59:57] he couldn't rest and just watch this
[59:58] house his father's house be a house of
[1:00:01] merchandise I mean he couldn't just
[1:00:03] stand there and say it's just all about
[1:00:05] buying offerings and and you're making
[1:00:07] money and cheating people and you know
[1:00:09] that wasn't the purpose of the house of
[1:00:11] God the purpose of the house of God is
[1:00:13] God will come and dwell among his
[1:00:15] children God would be there I'm in
[1:00:18] between the cherubims and the Holy of
[1:00:19] Holies I mean because you know you're
[1:00:22] the Israelites we know when Solomon
[1:00:24] dedicated the temple the pillar of fire
[1:00:26] came down Wynton a hallelujah above the
[1:00:30] mercy seat between the cherubims and
[1:00:31] there was such a you know you know
[1:00:33] there's such a cloud came down that even
[1:00:36] the ministers couldn't the priest
[1:00:37] couldn't minister no more God came to
[1:00:39] his temple and it was glorious and that
[1:00:42] was the purpose of that building is that
[1:00:44] God would be there I mean that people
[1:00:46] could come and bring an offering and
[1:00:47] their sins could be forgiven them I mean
[1:00:49] they could have fellowship with God I
[1:00:51] mean it's like Henner and the Old
[1:00:52] Testament she came she had a burden she
[1:00:55] had a zeal I must have a son and she
[1:00:58] went to the right place she went to the
[1:01:00] Tabernacle in the wilderness where God
[1:01:02] was and she wasn't deep she didn't care
[1:01:05] what other people thought she didn't
[1:01:07] care what others were saying what others
[1:01:09] thought about her she didn't care about
[1:01:11] them
[1:01:11] she had a zeal it was eating her up I
[1:01:14] need a child I must have a son I must
[1:01:17] have a child she didn't care
[1:01:19] hallelujah and when we get to that place
[1:01:22] we don't kin or more what this person
[1:01:25] says what this person thinks who cares
[1:01:27] about what others think what does God
[1:01:30] say what is God purpose I mean I think
[1:01:32] we should be so gripped I mean when we
[1:01:36] come into the house of God God what
[1:01:38] could you do in this service what could
[1:01:41] you do for me
[1:01:42] you can change my life in a moment
[1:01:44] hallelujah we should have be so gripped
[1:01:46] with the zeal of his house hallelujah
[1:01:50] just like I was sharing on Wednesday
[1:01:52] with your you know a showing of Papua
[1:01:54] New Guinea brother Ronnie who is the
[1:01:56] translator and the convention is so
[1:01:57] gripped he said he said the word is so
[1:02:00] powerful yes I moved and he went and he
[1:02:04] went and testified to thee to the
[1:02:06] Pentecostal brother the pastor and then
[1:02:08] you know and I shared the other part is
[1:02:10] my brother Robert had the dream that he
[1:02:11] is going to come into the church the
[1:02:13] next day brother Ronnie when testified
[1:02:15] to him brought him in I mean to the
[1:02:17] church God gripped him and now seven
[1:02:20] churches have come into the message
[1:02:21] because someone was moved
[1:02:23] someone was gripped I don't know if he
[1:02:26] expected that to happen but it happened
[1:02:28] to him hallelujah
[1:02:29] that should be the same thing with us we
[1:02:31] should be I don't know what you're gonna
[1:02:32] do God you can do anything in this
[1:02:35] moment of time you could change my life
[1:02:37] forever you can change how I think
[1:02:39] change my outlook then I'm no longer
[1:02:41] negative and downtrodden and feeling
[1:02:43] down but I'm positive
[1:02:44] I'm happy I'm rejoicing cuz I know the
[1:02:46] word is true and it will be fulfilled
[1:02:49] hallelujah hallelujah that's why I think
[1:02:53] you ever let the devil poke it down your
[1:02:55] throat that Campbell just be can't you
[1:02:56] go back to be normal how does he know he
[1:03:00] doesn't know I mean but you can be so
[1:03:02] moved that your life can be changed
[1:03:04] forever and it could be the same thing I
[1:03:07] mean even now I mean we're not cool just
[1:03:09] to come to church and go back to our old
[1:03:10] ways that's not what it's about
[1:03:12] and we had changed from glory to glory
[1:03:14] to glory by the Word of God from glory
[1:03:17] to glory to glory hallelujah so I think
[1:03:21] we should we need a greater expectation
[1:03:23] you mean well I've been in the message
[1:03:26] for years well this is another moment
[1:03:28] this is another season hallelujah so it
[1:03:33] means it's something that so so just
[1:03:36] just googling the meaning of the what
[1:03:39] you're eating me up it means to devour
[1:03:41] something that dominates the thoughts of
[1:03:44] someone completely that's when something
[1:03:48] eats you up it's not just part of your
[1:03:49] life not just something you do sometimes
[1:03:52] it's eating you up your
[1:03:54] assume you're gripped I mean you can't
[1:03:56] shake it you can't get rid of it you've
[1:03:58] been you're being apprehended just like
[1:04:01] the Apostle Paul's II thought I would
[1:04:03] apprehend that which has every hindered
[1:04:04] me I mean so the Lord apprehended him on
[1:04:07] the road to Damascus now he's reaching
[1:04:08] back saying Lord I want to pretend you I
[1:04:11] want more of you hallelujah amen
[1:04:17] now they in the other Gospels yo this
[1:04:22] this event is recorded on the other
[1:04:24] Gospels but it never just like for
[1:04:28] example in Luke I'll just read it Luke
[1:04:30] 1945 and he went into the temple and
[1:04:33] began to cast them out that salt therein
[1:04:34] and then that bought saying unto them it
[1:04:38] is written my house upon me is the house
[1:04:41] of prayer but you have made it a den of
[1:04:44] thieves it's only in John's Gospel that
[1:04:47] Eagle anointing that was upon him that
[1:04:49] is actually quickened to the disciples
[1:04:51] that's the zeal of thine house which is
[1:04:53] caused us to happen so it's more than
[1:04:55] just the outward what was going on but I
[1:04:57] could say something gripped them it
[1:04:59] gripped them I mean when the Lord came
[1:05:01] hallelujah
[1:05:02] it was the zeal of his house but you see
[1:05:04] now we aren't you know when when when
[1:05:07] well maybe let's just go through a few
[1:05:10] things we know that the house of God is
[1:05:13] not a building made with hands you know
[1:05:17] you think of when when the apostles were
[1:05:19] were there and they were with Jesus in
[1:05:21] Jerusalem and and his disciples said to
[1:05:24] him and in mark 13 and 1 he says um one
[1:05:29] of his disciples said unto master see
[1:05:32] what manner of stones and what buildings
[1:05:34] are here so they were saying master look
[1:05:36] how great those complexes look how great
[1:05:39] the temple is and really if he could
[1:05:43] have seen it he could have said you
[1:05:44] don't know what you're talking about
[1:05:46] these aren't the stones that are
[1:05:48] marvelous on the side of Lord they just
[1:05:50] human the cat stones put in the building
[1:05:52] I mean but he could have look at them
[1:05:54] and could have said no you're the stones
[1:05:55] you're the you're the habitation I mean
[1:05:59] of God you're the place where God dwells
[1:06:01] you're the place where God is going to
[1:06:03] be palaces not just your the building
[1:06:06] you know as
[1:06:07] Azimut season x7 he says who found favor
[1:06:12] before God and desired to find a
[1:06:14] tabernacle for the God of Jacob but
[1:06:17] Solomon built him in house howbeit the
[1:06:20] Most High dwelleth not in temples made
[1:06:22] with hands as say at the Prophet heaven
[1:06:25] is my throne and earth is my footstool
[1:06:26] what house will he build me saith the
[1:06:29] Lord or what is the place of my rest and
[1:06:33] it so you know he's asked a question so
[1:06:36] you know he says yo man men built
[1:06:39] Solomon built God a house and God was
[1:06:41] willing to be in that house but that
[1:06:43] wasn't his final destination that wasn't
[1:06:45] his final resting place that wasn't his
[1:06:47] final abode I mean but you know God
[1:06:50] doesn't dwell do you think about it God
[1:06:52] says I made the heavens you look out
[1:06:55] there the great the great pictures we
[1:06:57] have in the heavens down the galaxies
[1:06:58] and the nebulas and all those things
[1:07:00] because I made those things that's my
[1:07:02] throne I mean earth is my footstool is
[1:07:04] where I put my feet but where's the
[1:07:06] place of my rest he's I made all things
[1:07:08] but where am I gonna rest partly he
[1:07:11] could have rest it anywhere they said no
[1:07:13] where is it and and what he's saying
[1:07:15] he's actually putting out a question to
[1:07:17] humanity hallelujah where's the place of
[1:07:20] my rest and there should be something in
[1:07:22] the Bride of Christ saying in here and
[1:07:24] my soul is your resting place and me is
[1:07:28] where you dwell hallelujah amen so you
[1:07:33] know so the house that God finally
[1:07:35] dwells it is not a building of stone but
[1:07:38] it's people so when we talk about the
[1:07:41] zeal of thine house has eaten me up
[1:07:43] we're not talking about a building we're
[1:07:46] talking about a people we're talking
[1:07:47] about a people there should be a zeal
[1:07:50] something that consumes us for the house
[1:07:52] of God I mean for the Bride of Christ we
[1:07:56] should be gripped it should dominate our
[1:07:58] thinking should dominate our thoughts
[1:08:00] you say well that's the ministers job
[1:08:01] it's not just the minister's job I mean
[1:08:04] it's mums job it's dad's job as
[1:08:06] brother's job as sister's job and there
[1:08:08] we should be so gripped I mean here's
[1:08:10] the habitation of God's dwelling place
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:13] this is what God you know you know think
[1:08:15] about it the devil this civilization is
[1:08:18] the devil's achievement me and brother
[1:08:20] Andy were talking
[1:08:21] when we're here whatever night that was
[1:08:22] you know this is this is the devil's
[1:08:24] achievement out here this is the best he
[1:08:26] can do and there's nothing in the bride
[1:08:29] that wants it and may try and distract
[1:08:31] us but it's all shiny things and we see
[1:08:33] it's Hollow
[1:08:34] it just rings hollow there's nothing to
[1:08:36] it there's no substance I mean but you
[1:08:38] know but that's the devil's achievement
[1:08:40] and the reason he's put it out there is
[1:08:42] because now God has his achievement upon
[1:08:44] the earth a mirror people where the book
[1:08:46] has come up into them cause inheritance
[1:08:48] is no longer sealed has come unsealed
[1:08:51] I mean he's placed it into the hands of
[1:08:52] the people hollar he's made him in his
[1:08:54] image I'm in hallelujah
[1:08:57] whereas achievement what the Ephesian I
[1:09:00] should have became but they looked at
[1:09:02] and relaxed we haven't just looked at
[1:09:04] and relaxed we have become and we
[1:09:06] William just looked at the land and see
[1:09:07] that's a good land we're in the land and
[1:09:09] when we're cross Jordan we're taking our
[1:09:11] mountains am i taking out heritage
[1:09:14] hallelujah so you know this is God's
[1:09:17] achievement God's achievement is that
[1:09:20] people would vanish amen this mortality
[1:09:26] will put on immortality I mean by the
[1:09:28] Spirit of God that's within you the life
[1:09:30] and you will quicken your body how am I
[1:09:33] going to go on a rap you have God dwell
[1:09:35] in your soul I mean that life will
[1:09:37] change you so when we're talking about a
[1:09:42] house as I've seen it's a people see
[1:09:47] Paul would speak of Moses in Hebrews
[1:09:50] three he says wherefore holy brethren
[1:09:53] partakers of the heavenly calling
[1:09:54] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[1:09:57] our profession Christ Jesus who was
[1:10:01] faithful to him that appointed him as
[1:10:02] also Moses was faithful in all his house
[1:10:06] fullest man was counted worthy of more
[1:10:08] glory than Moses and so much as he who
[1:10:11] hath builded the house hath more honor
[1:10:14] than the house for every house is
[1:10:16] builded by some man but he that built
[1:10:18] all things as God and Moses Valley was
[1:10:21] faithful in all his house as a servant
[1:10:24] for a testimony of those things which
[1:10:27] were to be spoken after perming but
[1:10:31] Christ as a son over his own house who
[1:10:34] Hausa we if we hold fast the confidence
[1:10:37] and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto
[1:10:41] the end so here he's saying is that we
[1:10:43] are the Lord's house I mean so now here
[1:10:47] he was I just want to take you back to
[1:10:48] the moment of of you know here's Jesus
[1:10:51] standing before Pilate he was there as a
[1:10:54] man he was a guy he was fully gobby as a
[1:10:57] fully man he had to be that way in order
[1:10:59] to pay for our Redemption and here he
[1:11:01] was he was done before his accusers he
[1:11:04] is fulfilling the would of god what a Oh
[1:11:06] was the zeal the joy that was set before
[1:11:09] him was you redeemed and it gave him a
[1:11:12] zeal that consumed him amen he doesn't
[1:11:15] want us like the temple was made a house
[1:11:17] of merchandise things were traded things
[1:11:19] were bought things were sold you know
[1:11:22] there was just a religious form going on
[1:11:24] money-making scheme you know the devil
[1:11:26] just wants to make us a house of
[1:11:28] merchandise I mean he wants to put his
[1:11:31] brand upon us he wants to put his logo
[1:11:33] upon us he wants to put us his thoughts
[1:11:35] in our mind and consume us and you know
[1:11:37] but we just become a house of
[1:11:39] merchandise a mirror a dinner of thieves
[1:11:42] or how can you be a dinner thing so if
[1:11:44] you have a bunch of Devils in your den
[1:11:46] of thieves I mean but we're not called
[1:11:48] to be that kind of a person I mean we're
[1:11:51] called to be a place where God dwells I
[1:11:53] mean we're not a house of merchandise
[1:11:54] we're not just something that's just
[1:11:56] here to have a religious form forget the
[1:11:58] form forget religion it's not about
[1:12:00] religion it's about knowing Jesus Christ
[1:12:03] hallelujah according to his word this is
[1:12:07] relationship this message brings
[1:12:10] relationship Talya with the Lord Himself
[1:12:12] I mean so now so we don't want to be a
[1:12:15] house of merchandise and we should be
[1:12:18] zealous just like you're a cane ask God
[1:12:21] am I my brother's keeper
[1:12:22] he was his brother's keeper amen but
[1:12:26] it's more selfish about how he looked
[1:12:28] before God and he was right so he killed
[1:12:30] him we are our brother's keeper amen
[1:12:34] brother won't see a thing going on you
[1:12:35] go and pray for that person I mean you
[1:12:37] go lift them before God don't Gossman
[1:12:39] talk and run them down now lift them
[1:12:41] before the throne of heaven
[1:12:42] I mean what's gossip done for anyone has
[1:12:46] it helped anyone
[1:12:47] man no so why why continue if we
[1:12:51] continue doing the same things we'll get
[1:12:52] the same results I mean but that's why
[1:12:55] that's why this is not a Reformation I
[1:12:57] mean the Reformation produced
[1:12:59] denomination I mean but this is
[1:13:00] transformation time this is legal
[1:13:02] anointing time is where God comes down
[1:13:04] and carries the people away hallelujah
[1:13:07] I meant it you know we should have a
[1:13:11] zeal for the house of God I'm not
[1:13:15] talking about these four walls only but
[1:13:16] we should say this is our church this is
[1:13:18] not my church this is our church amen
[1:13:21] I trust your borden yeah I mean yeah
[1:13:24] you're behind it this is where I
[1:13:26] fellowship and it's not about the name
[1:13:28] on the door that's irrelevant who cares
[1:13:29] about it we just need a name because you
[1:13:32] know where do you go this is where I go
[1:13:33] maybe we just could have put an address
[1:13:35] here what yeah whatever but you know
[1:13:36] it's not about a brand or something no
[1:13:38] this is this is this is us I mean we
[1:13:41] should we should be behind it we should
[1:13:43] be invested I mean and it's not about
[1:13:46] the building is about the people we
[1:13:48] should have a genuine care about one
[1:13:50] another I mean you know many taught you
[1:13:53] know the Bible says then so I'll
[1:13:55] probably eat this mixed up like I do do
[1:13:57] a lot of things but if you want to have
[1:13:59] friends you got to be friendly the
[1:14:01] scripture says so if you want to obtain
[1:14:04] mercy you've got to be merciful I mean
[1:14:07] so they but they should be they should
[1:14:08] be such a zeal and you there doesn't
[1:14:12] matter what's happened to you the zeal
[1:14:14] of thine house should eat you up in such
[1:14:17] a way that it should override whatever
[1:14:19] has happened in the past
[1:14:20] it should override it should cancel up
[1:14:22] it should make it actually irrelevant
[1:14:24] what has happened hallelujah you take
[1:14:27] the Apostle Paul he was shipwrecked he
[1:14:29] was beaten he fought with the beasts of
[1:14:31] Ephesus that was religious spirits and
[1:14:33] people you know he was robbed he was put
[1:14:35] in jail did that stop him no because the
[1:14:39] zeal of thine house he was a man like we
[1:14:43] mean but he had such a zeal it didn't
[1:14:46] disable his faith he didn't just go sit
[1:14:49] in the corner say well it's too hard no
[1:14:51] here too zeal he had a passion
[1:14:54] amen I trap I pray God give us a zeal
[1:14:58] and this wishy-washy age they stand they
[1:15:02] stand for the word let's have a real
[1:15:05] gumption why should we just let the
[1:15:07] devil ride it and ride out I say no we
[1:15:10] should stand on waters out as you just

[1:15:38] they're coming holy that was the zeal
[1:15:40] here too zeal for the household of God
[1:15:43] here a zeal for Israel he said now
[1:15:45] they're not staying in this condition
[1:15:47] I'm gonna take them out of this place

[1:19:24] thine house he got angry
[1:19:26] why because Ezra was being held captive
[1:19:28] by this bluff by this devil hallelujah
[1:19:31] Goliath was his armor was brass what
[1:19:34] does brass represent divine judgment so
[1:19:37] that weapons the armor of glass was

[1:19:41] and useless and defeated hallelujah and
[1:19:44] David got mad how dare he do this who is
[1:19:47] this uncircumcised Philistine and he
[1:19:49] starts to testify around you know and

[1:20:05] camp I come in what part of Israel three
[1:20:08] thousand of them came to Samson and said
[1:20:12] we're going to tie you up and give you
[1:20:13] to the Philistines three thousand men
[1:20:15] that's an army three thousand men we're
[1:20:18] coming to the champion you know coming
[1:20:20] to the champion of it of Israel that was
[1:20:23] that was created that was in the land to
[1:20:26] destroy the Philistines
[1:20:27] three thousand men and then and then
[1:20:30] what happened they tied him up and they
[1:20:32] took him to the Philistines and then
[1:20:34] that's when and it says that the
[1:20:35] Philistines shouted at him and the
[1:20:37] Spirit of God came upon him hallelujah I
[1:20:40] pray when the devil comes against you
[1:20:42] you just feel anointed I'm not putting
[1:20:48] up with his nonsense he must die sorry

[1:20:53] he gets anointed he breaks the bands of
[1:20:55] the rope he picks up the jawbone he
[1:20:57] kills a thousand of them now my question
[1:20:59] is three thousand a thousand three
[1:21:02] thousand and God's anointed champion
[1:21:05] against you know three thousand his
[1:21:07] rights

[1:21:25] around you let's take them what was
[1:21:28] wrong the zeal of thine house hadn't
[1:21:30] eaten them up there are more worried
[1:21:32] about trying to survive
[1:21:34] then then take back their god-given
[1:21:37] rights we are not here to survive I mean

[1:22:18] it I mean you've got to believe it
[1:22:20] you're not here to lose your hair to win
[1:22:21] and then we're here to walk out
[1:22:23] victorious hallelujah amen the
[1:22:27] overcomers what at you it says when yo
[1:22:30] John is there in Revelations 5 and he's
[1:22:33] and he's looking and he sees no man is
[1:22:35] worthy to take the book and he's but
[1:22:37] then he's yeah yeah one of the oldest is
[1:22:39] don't wait John one of the other for the
[1:22:42] Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:22:44] that would prevail means to wrestle with
[1:22:47] and overcome so he wrestled hallelujah
[1:22:50] but he won amen and then he steps forth
[1:22:53] out of the eternity takes the book and
[1:22:55] opens the seals it changed John's whole
[1:22:57] life and because he now here was a man
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:00] that could redeem us he was a man that
[1:23:02] could restore us and that was the same
[1:23:04] man they leaned on the bosom upon in the
[1:23:07] days of his earthly journey it changed
[1:23:09] us whole oh and brother Bram says if we
[1:23:11] could lay aside our sinful thoughts this
[1:23:13] morning that same Lamb could go come all
[1:23:16] the way from eternity to you hallelujah
[1:23:19] that's why the devil gets a so caught up
[1:23:21] and while Monday I've got to do this

[1:23:58] itself
[1:23:59] Jesus says tomorrow take care of itself
[1:24:01] it'll look after itself it's its own
[1:24:03] problem you don't need to worry you

[1:24:54] how lujah why could think it changes it
[1:24:57] because God comes down so you got to see
[1:24:59] the value there's nothing to this that
[1:25:02] is everything to this but you've got to
[1:25:04] experience it Amen you're that pillar of
[1:25:07] fire brother and CEO comes down into the
[1:25:09] meeting that same one is still here he's
[1:25:13] not a historical God you know there's
[1:25:15] more visitations of angels pretty much
[1:25:17] in the New Testament than the old and
[1:25:19] angels didn't stop visiting people after
[1:25:22] this book was finished being written
[1:25:24] amen brother I said we can have
[1:25:26] visitations of angels in our house where
[1:25:29] we have God that they could come and
[1:25:31] minister to us amen
[1:25:34] that's not pie in the sky that's reality
[1:25:37] who wants visitations of angels who
[1:25:41] wants the Lord Himself to come down
[1:25:42] where you are doesn't matter where you
[1:25:44] are you can be cleaning dishes vacuuming
[1:25:46] you can be driving you can be in the
[1:25:47] supermarket doesn't matter what's around
[1:25:49] you I mean you've got a focus on him
[1:25:52] hallelujah because you'll find the more
[1:25:55] you're in their atmosphere the more
[1:25:56] he'll change you to be like him I'm in
[1:26:00] oh yeah by the way I'm said just read
[1:26:07] this he sees this and um where we going
[1:26:11] I'm more back-to-front here we are okay
[1:26:17] I don't think I can count I a page two
[1:26:18] page three that's how it goes good he
[1:26:21] says this this is a dedication he sees
[1:26:24] he sees but when God came to his own
[1:26:27] temple the church the people when he
[1:26:29] came to them he filled it the temples
[1:26:31] that were dedicated just like he did at
[1:26:33] Solomon's Temple he filled it not with
[1:26:34] Creed's not with denominations but with
[1:26:37] himself he filled the temple with his
[1:26:39] Shekinah glory so he did on the day of
[1:26:42] Pentecost he filled them 120 temples
[1:26:45] that was up there with himself with the
[1:26:47] holy spirit itself the Shekinah glory
[1:26:49] broke through upon them then then what
[1:26:53] Nimrod failed to do build a temple that
[1:26:55] every man spoke contrary to what he
[1:26:58] could understand God came down and with
[1:27:00] one Galilean language made every man
[1:27:02] understand what he was saying and they
[1:27:04] know that it was brought this is God to
[1:27:08] his temple God to his dedicated temple
[1:27:12] not a man-made achievement not what man
[1:27:15] has done but what God did himself I mean
[1:27:19] and that's what the that's what his
[1:27:21] houses it's his achievement it's what he
[1:27:24] has done
[1:27:24] brother Aaron preaches the statue of a
[1:27:26] perfect man and the title is actually
[1:27:28] wrong he never called it that he says I
[1:27:31] want to speak this morning I want to
[1:27:33] speak on the subject now I'm not gonna
[1:27:35] go into this but but this is what he
[1:27:36] called it or teach rather if we can
[1:27:39] building the Living Tabernacle building
[1:27:42] the living tabernacle of the Living
[1:27:44] God's dwelling place that sounds a lot
[1:27:47] better than statue of a perfect man
[1:27:48] that's what and and isn't that what the
[1:27:51] word has to do build the Living
[1:27:53] tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling
[1:27:55] place that he would build his house
[1:27:58] hallelujah I mean so it was Jesus
[1:28:02] standing before Pilate he was cloaked
[1:28:05] with zeal because he had a burden for
[1:28:11] his house amen
[1:28:14] went to the woman at the well why did he
[1:28:15] go the zeal of thine house has eaten him
[1:28:17] up I mean here was one who been made
[1:28:20] merchandise of the world she had six
[1:28:23] husbands one I mean five husbands the
[1:28:25] one she is worth wasn't hers you know
[1:28:27] the world is made merchandise over
[1:28:30] turned her into what you know that way
[1:28:32] but but the zeal of the Lord said I'm
[1:28:36] not gonna leave you this way you are not
[1:28:38] going to stay this way I mean that's why
[1:28:39] he went by the way of Samaria and
[1:28:41] because her zeal neo zeal can be a big
[1:28:44] wild fiber can be just a quiet burning
[1:28:46] flame who's never seen like a blowtorch
[1:28:48] and and and when it's it just right you
[1:28:51] know yellow flames is not actually hot
[1:28:54] as white a blue a blue flame the oxygen
[1:28:57] mix is just right and it's burning way
[1:28:58] hotter than the yellow flame and a zeal
[1:29:01] can just be a quiet burning
[1:29:03] determination day-in day-out we're
[1:29:07] pressing the battle we're one day closer
[1:29:09] I mean the Lord is here he's come to
[1:29:12] take us away and everything you do is
[1:29:14] just ye this way the zeal of thine house
[1:29:17] I mean I care about the household of God
[1:29:19] Jesus said I sanctify myself not for my
[1:29:23] sake but for that for this ation that's
[1:29:26] why he's separate that's why he
[1:29:27] sanctified himself separated himself I
[1:29:30] mean it was for the disciples sake and
[1:29:32] it was for our sake and it should be us
[1:29:34] you say well I can do anything I want
[1:29:36] sure but what about the zeal of his
[1:29:38] house amen
[1:29:40] shouldn't be that way we should sanctify
[1:29:43] ourselves we should be separated unto
[1:29:45] God not just for our sakes but for
[1:29:47] everyone's sakes hallelujah don't we
[1:29:50] want to have services with God just
[1:29:52] comes down and takes over completely I
[1:29:53] mean don't we want to have services we
[1:29:55] don't even remember really what happened
[1:29:57] because God just came down God anoints
[1:29:59] the minister got an oyster song leader
[1:30:00] got an oyster worship it just takes over
[1:30:03] hallelujah
[1:30:04] don't you want that kind of to anyone
[1:30:05] that kind of church I mean Sunday and
[1:30:08] Wednesday I mean don't you one that kind
[1:30:09] of family altar at home God just comes
[1:30:11] down
[1:30:12] I mean you got up in the scripture then
[1:30:13] you feel to go somewhere else and God
[1:30:15] anoints that scripture I mean when you
[1:30:17] pray together God comes down you have a
[1:30:18] pre-meeting not because and this here
[1:30:20] you're desiring that he comes hallelujah
[1:30:24] why is that because you're separated
[1:30:27] this should be a zeal
[1:30:29] we shouldn't be caught up in our own
[1:30:30] things well I've got this to do I've got
[1:30:32] this this is enough forget those things
[1:30:34] what about Lord what do you want done
[1:30:37] may the zeal mate made the zeal of thine
[1:30:40] house eat me up consuming dominate my
[1:30:42] thinking my motives and objectives are
[1:30:45] just because of the zeal of his house
[1:30:46] not because of selfishness or political
[1:30:49] agendas or trying to sway people at
[1:30:51] different things
[1:30:51] no the zeal of his house should eat us
[1:30:53] up I'm just gonna hammer the circle it's
[1:30:57] hammered okay because you know we are
[1:31:00] this this country is so wishy-washy
[1:31:03] because we have it too easy
[1:31:05] amen we'll never run out of food we have
[1:31:09] it too easy we're not starving we don't
[1:31:12] run out of water
[1:31:13] amen we have it way too easy we go oh
[1:31:16] you know I want new clothes just go buy
[1:31:19] them you know we don't we're the same
[1:31:21] thing day in day out take it down to the
[1:31:23] river wash it put it back on we don't do
[1:31:25] that kind of thing why we have it too
[1:31:28] easy and people's lives are so consumed
[1:31:30] in things that don't matter but when
[1:31:32] they come to the end of the road then
[1:31:34] what then what we've got to have a
[1:31:38] gumption a real wrought yard just a real
[1:31:41] let's let's let's push this thing
[1:31:43] through hallelujah amen let's take a
[1:31:47] rapture amen let's have a let's have a
[1:31:51] church where God just anoints how was

[1:31:59] word just passed through my soul and
[1:32:01] just took out all the world I mean what
[1:32:03] happened I walked in those tongues
[1:32:04] interpretation cooled out my life I
[1:32:06] needed it praise the Lord
[1:32:08] I mean brother I'm said to the church
[1:32:10] had come to a place where as soon as
[1:32:12] someone comes in with sin in their lives
[1:32:13] this should be prophecy and
[1:32:15] interpretation of tongues it speaks them
[1:32:17] directly saying this is what's wrong
[1:32:18] with you make it right
[1:32:20] yeah God knows all things why are we
[1:32:22] trying to hide hallelujah you say well
[1:32:26] you could never obtain that number God
[1:32:28] wants it and if God wants it I believe
[1:32:30] if we just yield ourselves and surrender
[1:32:32] to them say Lord what do you want
[1:32:34] make it happen I'm just an instrument in
[1:32:37] your hand do with me what you will
[1:32:39] hallelujah then he will cause it to
[1:32:41] happen amen we should the zeal of thine
[1:32:48] house we don't want to be caught up we
[1:32:53] don't want to be made a house of
[1:32:54] merchandise or a den of thieves

[1:38:52] devil is not even a memory we shall
[1:38:54] still be hallelujah glory to God now are
[1:38:59] we sorry you were there judges one now
[1:39:03] and the children of Israel did evil in
[1:39:05] the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[1:39:06] delivered them into the hand of Midian
[1:39:08] seven years and the hand of Midian
[1:39:11] prevailed against Israel and because of
[1:39:13] the Midianites the children of Israel
[1:39:16] made them dense which are in the
[1:39:18] mountains and caves and strongholds and
[1:39:21] so it was when Israel had so and that
[1:39:24] the Midianites came up and the
[1:39:25] Amalekites and the children of the east
[1:39:27] even they came up against them and they
[1:39:31] encamped against him and destroyed the
[1:39:32] increase of the earth till thou come
[1:39:35] unto Gaza upon me and left no substance
[1:39:38] I mean sustenance for Israel neither
[1:39:41] sheep nor oxen or ass for they came up
[1:39:44] with their cattle and their tents and
[1:39:45] they came as grasshoppers for multitude
[1:39:47] for both they and their camels were
[1:39:49] without number and they entered into the
[1:39:52] land to destroy it now this word Midian
[1:39:56] is very interesting and so the same word
[1:40:00] means Midian which is a son of Abraham
[1:40:03] but that same word as also a brawling or
[1:40:08] it's a very a brawling or contingence
[1:40:11] that's what Midian means and it's
[1:40:14] actually from the root word of a contest
[1:40:16] or a quote or a quarrel or a discord or
[1:40:20] strife so just put it this way when the
[1:40:24] when the discord came in when the strife
[1:40:27] came in when the contingents came in
[1:40:29] what it is Rael do did they stand on
[1:40:32] their god-given right and say this is my
[1:40:33] land no they said we're just going to
[1:40:36] bury ourselves in a cave or a stronghold
[1:40:37] we're just going to try and ride this
[1:40:39] thing out we don't here to ride this
[1:40:41] thing out we're here to conquer every
[1:40:44] devil we are here we're not here to put
[1:40:47] up with his nonsense no not one day the
[1:40:50] zeal of thine house should eat you up
[1:40:52] I mean God is jealous of you of the
[1:40:54] godly jealousy he is zealous over you I
[1:40:57] mean his whole all of his energies is at
[1:40:59] you
[1:41:00] hallelujah he's not you're not his
[1:41:02] part-time girlfriend he doesn't have any
[1:41:04] amen he he makes a full commitment I'll
[1:41:08] be with you to the end
[1:41:09] in sickness and in health good times and
[1:41:11] bad times richer or poorer I'll be with
[1:41:13] you I'll be with you in the flood the
[1:41:15] fire the famine wherever it may be I'll
[1:41:17] be with you you shall be my people I'll
[1:41:19] be your God he makes a commitment he
[1:41:22] doesn't break that commitment hallelujah
[1:41:25] so we need to have a real and so if he's
[1:41:27] that way to us how should we how should
[1:41:29] we respond in sickness and in health
[1:41:32] richer poorer I'll be with you good
[1:41:34] times bad times happy times sad times
[1:41:37] questioning times I'll be with you it
[1:41:42] pays off to stay with Jesus Christ amen
[1:41:46] so now so so it's when the quarrels or
[1:41:49] the contention or the discord of the
[1:41:51] strife came in and they just said let's
[1:41:55] make caves let's make dents let's make
[1:41:57] strongholds let's go hide away
[1:42:00] we're not called no I just wanna I'm
[1:42:03] just gonna hammer this for a little bit
[1:42:05] maybe I should have been a builder we're
[1:42:08] not called win the win when trouble
[1:42:11] comes in we're not called you to say
[1:42:13] well I just can't handle this this is
[1:42:15] too big I'm gonna quit I'm just gonna
[1:42:18] I'm just gonna shell it within myself
[1:42:20] become detach from everyone and become
[1:42:22] an individual in my home emotionally
[1:42:24] detached from everything and just shell
[1:42:25] up and just basically like a tortoise or
[1:42:28] whatever pulled itself into its shell
[1:42:30] and you know kind of wait for it to go
[1:42:32] away that's not what we call to be I
[1:42:36] mean that's not what we call to be and
[1:42:38] you see now when these problems in the
[1:42:41] you know that your other contingents of
[1:42:42] disc discord and strife coming in as
[1:42:45] soon as Israel sews the Midianites the
[1:42:48] trouble came and plucked away so never
[1:42:51] actually enjoyed amen the fruit of the
[1:42:53] land because that trouble took it away
[1:42:56] the discord took it away
[1:43:00] we are not cool and I just I'm just so
[1:43:04] we are not called to live in that
[1:43:06] condition why are we you know so many
[1:43:09] believers are human shields for the
[1:43:11] devil because
[1:43:13] the devil's exposed God shoots them and
[1:43:16] you're free you know a human shield is a
[1:43:20] you know they sometimes it's against the
[1:43:23] world sometimes people maybe even do it
[1:43:25] you know willingly but we're not caught
[1:43:28] you know brother and says with the
[1:43:29] discernment he says you should see the
[1:43:31] look on the people's faces when the
[1:43:33] devil knows he's about to be exposed and
[1:43:35] that's why he hates it amen and that's
[1:43:38] why the devil hates a Holy Ghost filled
[1:43:40] Church where the word can come bypass
[1:43:43] whatever's here amen and God can come
[1:43:46] and meet your need and expose the devil
[1:43:48] but now you've got to have a choice
[1:43:50] eager to hold on to them we should not
[1:43:53] be you know you say well I've loved them
[1:43:57] I've lived with him with all these years
[1:43:59] one why you used to get rid of the guy

[1:44:08] been harboring this pain for such a long

[1:45:27] friend those that have friends show
[1:45:29] themselves friendly so in order to
[1:45:32] overcome the bunker you've got to do the
[1:45:34] opposite of the bunker you have to do
[1:45:36] the opposite you can't just do the same
[1:45:37] old thing well this person's got to get
[1:45:39] me out now you've got to do the opposite
[1:45:41] you've got to break the cycle you've got
[1:45:43] to put action to your faith if you
[1:45:45] believe the law can deliver you of all
[1:45:47] things step out of the bunker step out
[1:45:50] of the pain step out of the her step out
[1:45:52] of the complex
[1:45:52] you say well but I'll feel silly no
[1:45:55] that's the devil trying to tell you that
[1:45:56] I but people think less of me no that's
[1:45:58] the devil telling you that because it's
[1:46:00] the devil being ridiculous he he snared
[1:46:03] you into it and now he doesn't want to
[1:46:06] be exposed that's why you feel that way
[1:46:08] but when he's gone you just rejoice I
[1:46:10] mean there's no longer a bunkie
[1:46:12] I mean I mean I mean a bunker it's a
[1:46:14] testimony of God's grace holy and God
[1:46:17] can use it as a weapon against the devil
[1:46:21] I'm it's a way why should we come into
[1:46:25] this kind of state that whenever we try
[1:46:28] and so oh I'm going to do something
[1:46:29] different I'm going to try and mean the
[1:46:30] relationship I'm going to do something
[1:46:32] more but if you're living in a
[1:46:33] stronghold that trouble just gobbles it
[1:46:35] up we're not cool to live this way well
[1:46:40] I live below your privilege they went
[1:46:42] God never see to them in you show you
[1:46:44] shall dwell in caves and Den's and you
[1:46:46] know no you're gonna live in the land
[1:46:48] you're gonna live in the valleys you're
[1:46:50] gonna live in the good places you're
[1:46:51] gonna live you know you're gonna enjoy
[1:46:53] your inheritance
[1:46:54] Allu yeah so what happened the
[1:47:01] Midianites came in the trouble overcame
[1:47:05] them it wasn't the zeal of us of their
[1:47:08] house didn't eat them up it was what the
[1:47:10] trouble was causing dominated their
[1:47:13] lives that's why they built they didn't
[1:47:15] build the strongholds because nothing
[1:47:16] was going on no the trouble came in that
[1:47:19] contentions the strife
[1:47:20] that's why we should never be troubles
[1:47:22] going to come into every family I mean
[1:47:25] we don't live in some bubble the devil
[1:47:27] can't you know if he can't get me he'll
[1:47:29] try and get my wife if he can't get my
[1:47:31] wife who try to get my children he'll
[1:47:33] find a way in if he can Amen he will he
[1:47:39] doesn't hate you no he's not a gentleman
[1:47:40] he doesn't take prisoners he's just he's
[1:47:43] a slicker he'll do whatever he can just
[1:47:46] trying to get a toehold but as soon as
[1:47:48] it comes in
[1:47:49] you know these Israelites were still
[1:47:52] circumcised Jews living in the Promised
[1:47:53] Land
[1:47:55] amen so they were still the children of
[1:47:58] promise but why put up with trouble we
[1:48:04] have a right to kick it out but the
[1:48:06] problem is people bury themselves and
[1:48:09] other things they bury themselves just
[1:48:12] to try and cope we're not called our
[1:48:14] coping mechanism as the Holy Ghost our
[1:48:18] joy comes from him I mean our joy comes
[1:48:21] from her me say well I just need to feel
[1:48:22] happy get in his presence long enough
[1:48:25] you'll feel happy I mean that start well
[1:48:27] how do you do that start the signal what
[1:48:29] song what's your favorite Christian song
[1:48:31] start to sing it and you'll find burdens
[1:48:33] left you'll find yourself happy
[1:48:35] crying rejoicing amen you say well I
[1:48:38] can't sing well there's there's a lot of
[1:48:39] good message music on YouTube or
[1:48:41] something just go listen to that and
[1:48:42] pretend you're in the show you'll sound
[1:48:44] awesome and sing away you'll change the
[1:48:47] atmosphere and you say man I was having
[1:48:50] a great time you can have that time
[1:48:51] anywhere you can turn the volume down
[1:48:53] and be having a shouting time in here
[1:48:55] walking down the street oh yeah I can't
[1:49:00] be done or yet can't be done to the
[1:49:03] wrong places that can't be done
[1:49:05] hallelujah but the problem is we get
[1:49:08] caught up the devil always tries to you
[1:49:11] know he always tries to make us feel
[1:49:13] down you know you're not happy today
[1:49:16] you're having a bad day eternal life
[1:49:20] which one but if he can get you to agree
[1:49:24] with his thoughts it's gonna take you
[1:49:26] down a very dark and lonely road of this
[1:49:30] person to this maybe they did love
[1:49:32] covers a multitude of sins
[1:49:34] he did it again well love covers a
[1:49:36] multitude of sin I've never had to
[1:49:39] forgive someone 70 times 7 in one day I
[1:49:42] you know incredible I mean no I mean
[1:49:45] who's ever had to do that Jesus said you
[1:49:47] have to do that we don't well we don't
[1:49:50] keep well we shouldn't keep accounts
[1:49:51] anyway you know or you're 50 away then I
[1:49:54] cannot forgive you you know come on you
[1:49:56] know but you know but we should if the
[1:49:58] devil the devil can try and get our
[1:50:01] thinking on his line of thinking he's
[1:50:03] got us amen all these nothing - this is
[1:50:07] not real as my parents are just
[1:50:08] emotionally misses because I raised this
[1:50:10] way is it amen no that's God hallelujah
[1:50:16] Jesus Christ is alive amen beer it so
[1:50:19] people bury themselves or hide
[1:50:21] themselves in something to try and cope
[1:50:24] and it begins to eat them up that's the
[1:50:28] wrong zeal now I'm going to go into this
[1:50:33] and another time but I'm going to just
[1:50:34] drop us in here because I was I felt -
[1:50:38] he sees this I mean I mean this is so
[1:50:43] there are there are such things today
[1:50:47] that are on the same power as gambling
[1:50:50] and drug and alcohol addiction but it
[1:50:54] looks okay see where's your comfort
[1:50:58] where's your comfort there's a there's a
[1:51:01] there's a thing called problematic
[1:51:03] social media use also known as social
[1:51:06] media addiction or social media overuse
[1:51:09] it is proposed form of psychological or
[1:51:12] behavioral dependence on a social media
[1:51:15] platforms similar to gaming disorder
[1:51:18] internet addiction disorder and other
[1:51:20] forms of digital media overuse it is
[1:51:23] generally defined as the problematic
[1:51:25] compulsive use of social media platforms
[1:51:28] that result in significant impairments
[1:51:30] and an individual's function in various
[1:51:33] life form
[1:51:34] domains over a prolonged period of time
[1:51:37] this and other relationships between
[1:51:39] digital media use and mental health have
[1:51:42] been considerably researched debated in
[1:51:44] disguise
[1:51:45] among its experts in several disciplines
[1:51:48] and have generated controversy in
[1:51:51] medical scientific and technological
[1:51:53] communities research suggests that it
[1:51:56] affects women and girls more than boys
[1:51:57] and men and it appears to it to affect
[1:52:00] individuals based on the social media
[1:52:03] platform use such disorders can be
[1:52:06] diagnosed when an individual engages in
[1:52:09] online activities and the cost of
[1:52:12] fulfilling daily responsibilities or
[1:52:15] pursuing other interests and without
[1:52:18] regard for the negative consequences
[1:52:22] what's that people bury themselves in
[1:52:25] something and you can bury yourself in a
[1:52:27] hobby oh it's not all a clone or any
[1:52:30] device you can bury yourself in a hobby
[1:52:32] you can bury yourself in your job you
[1:52:35] can bury yourself in anything and that
[1:52:39] thing can dominate your life it can
[1:52:42] dominate your relationships with your
[1:52:44] family you can dominate your
[1:52:46] relationships with others that thing
[1:52:48] becomes first place what is it it's a
[1:52:51] cave it's a DIN and people can put a
[1:52:55] scripture you're a spiritual tag on it
[1:52:57] but it can still just be a place where
[1:53:00] people have buried themselves cell phone
[1:53:03] addiction sometimes referred to as
[1:53:05] problematic mobile phone use as a
[1:53:07] behavioral addiction thought to be
[1:53:09] similar to that of an internet gambling
[1:53:11] shopping or video game addiction and
[1:53:14] least a severe impairment or distress in
[1:53:17] one's life it's addiction people have
[1:53:21] done studies you know there's a there's
[1:53:22] a part of your brain and it's like the
[1:53:24] pleasure part of your brain and every
[1:53:26] time you do something that that you find
[1:53:27] it's pleasurable it produces a chemical
[1:53:29] called dopamine and it actually
[1:53:31] activates it makes you feel good it's a
[1:53:33] feel-good chemical in your brain and
[1:53:35] people have found that when people can
[1:53:38] be everytime people can send a whatsapp
[1:53:41] or a text or something what what they
[1:53:44] trying to do is they try to get people
[1:53:46] to respond and then when they get a
[1:53:48] response dopamine is triggered in their
[1:53:50] brain they're actually people actually
[1:53:52] feeding an addiction now I'll say this
[1:53:55] now there's nothing wrong with
[1:53:56] contacting people
[1:53:58] amen there's nothing wrong but but why
[1:54:00] yeah people feel lonely and down and
[1:54:02] within themselves whether people can
[1:54:04] start texting hey what are you doing
[1:54:05] what's going on yeah there's a fine line
[1:54:07] what's your motive and objective
[1:54:09] is it to feed a addiction or is because
[1:54:12] you actually genuinely care about the
[1:54:13] person you know is it about demmer is it
[1:54:16] about you because if it's about you
[1:54:19] you're just looking for a hit you're
[1:54:21] looking to light up another cigarette or
[1:54:22] you know shoot some drugs it's basically
[1:54:24] the same thing because it's producing
[1:54:26] pleasure in your brain amen
[1:54:29] well what is that why do people turn to
[1:54:32] such things for the thing we don't drink
[1:54:35] amen we don't smoke amen we don't do
[1:54:40] drugs amen
[1:54:41] but we can be on this and be the same
[1:54:44] kind of edit nothing wrong with the
[1:54:46] phone it's the user or we can be on the
[1:54:50] internet we can be a we can be buried in
[1:54:52] our job and our studies we can be a bird
[1:54:55] and say what's that you're addicted and
[1:54:57] and how's the relationship with your
[1:54:59] family but this I need a release God is
[1:55:05] our release brother I see the lid off
[1:55:07] the pressure get in this presence and
[1:55:09] you let the pressure off what's happened
[1:55:11] the devil wants to try and ward us away
[1:55:13] that we can can't get into his presence
[1:55:15] no more why honestly
[1:55:19] all we need more of is the Holy Ghost
[1:55:21] all we need is more of him he say but
[1:55:25] I've got this issue in my life give it
[1:55:27] to him give it because we know we know
[1:55:30] when things are in us and they read our
[1:55:32] cage in these complexes and paints we
[1:55:34] know what it is just shout it from the
[1:55:37] rooftops this is what happened to me the
[1:55:40] devil did this to me I hate him
[1:55:42] I don't want to be a human shield no
[1:55:45] more I don't want this strife these many
[1:55:48] nights to get me down no more hallelujah
[1:55:52] amen so now if we have a zeal listen if
[1:55:55] we have a zeal for his house we have a
[1:55:57] zeal for our families we have a zeal for
[1:56:00] our brothers and sisters now we have the
[1:56:03] privilege today to apply the token I
[1:56:05] mean that the life of God would be
[1:56:07] applied now I'm going to basically
[1:56:09] repeat what brother Tim preached it you
[1:56:11] know
[1:56:11] you know Cloverdale Kemp bases you apply
[1:56:14] the token to yourself first apply it to
[1:56:17] your own life first I mean so if you're
[1:56:20] lazy if you're indifferent apply the
[1:56:22] token apply the Holy Ghost to your
[1:56:24] laziness your indifference to your
[1:56:26] slothfulness I mean we're not called to
[1:56:28] be slothful people we're not cool to me
[1:56:30] in different people we're called a
[1:56:31] Brazil I mean cuz whatever you know
[1:56:34] you're the world just bombard us we just
[1:56:36] think well we cannot obtain to anything
[1:56:38] let's just sit back and watch the world
[1:56:39] go by no that's not what we're called to
[1:56:41] do we should have a drive
[1:56:44] we should have a real Drive I'm serving
[1:56:46] God I'm worshipping Him I'm loving him
[1:56:49] I'm walking with him hallelujah we
[1:56:51] should have that drive shouldn't we have
[1:56:53] it we say well I don't have that kind of
[1:56:55] Drive you say God give me a burden
[1:56:57] give me a burden to pray give me a
[1:56:59] burden to be a blessing not what I can
[1:57:02] take what can I give what can you pour
[1:57:04] into me to give to others that's how it
[1:57:06] should be I mean we are here for one
[1:57:08] another we're not here for ourselves or
[1:57:11] what can I get out of the service though
[1:57:13] what can I do for others I mean I can
[1:57:15] produce an atmosphere that God can come
[1:57:17] down amen if there's anything in God of
[1:57:19] those people how what were they having
[1:57:22] hallelujah that's how we should be we
[1:57:24] should not be inward looking we should
[1:57:27] be outward looking how can we help our
[1:57:29] children I mean you say apply that how
[1:57:31] do you apply the token get on their
[1:57:33] level become their friends that they can
[1:57:36] you know one of the things that devil
[1:57:38] did with me my parents were living
[1:57:40] overseas in America and some are eyes at
[1:57:42] boarding school I just thought my
[1:57:43] parents don't understand me but did I
[1:57:46] ever go and speak to them that I ever
[1:57:49] try and help them to understand me maybe
[1:57:51] they wouldn't understand me but the
[1:57:53] devil had it twisted in my mind they're
[1:57:55] on there in another country they don't
[1:57:56] understand me they don't know what I'm
[1:57:58] going through what's happening the devil
[1:58:00] now has broken a lifeline isolated who's
[1:58:07] ever had those sorts
[1:58:08] my parents don't understand me I'll put
[1:58:11] my hands up for everyone basically
[1:58:12] because you always come to that place in
[1:58:14] life amen
[1:58:14] the sky doesn't hoodies you know but
[1:58:18] they want to understand you I mean if
[1:58:20] they love you they'll want to try and
[1:58:21] understand you but you can't if you want
[1:58:23] to but sometimes we have to make
[1:58:25] the stip amen it's not just you know we
[1:58:28] can be crying on the inside for help and
[1:58:32] you know hey done good what's going on
[1:58:37] nothing and you can have this big bowl
[1:58:40] of pain sitting right here he said well
[1:58:44] I don't know how to start start
[1:58:47] somewhere how you feeling today pass
[1:58:50] things what's too big no God can do
[1:58:53] anything God can do anything God can
[1:58:57] take care of anything you know we should
[1:59:00] never just have a front you know I put
[1:59:04] on my church front today do my hair
[1:59:07] praise the Lord you know if we need help
[1:59:11] we need help
[1:59:13] there's nothing wrong with needing help
[1:59:15] my help cometh from the Lord I need help
[1:59:17] I need this help every day hallelujah I
[1:59:21] need this help just to get to work and
[1:59:22] to do working to come home
[1:59:24] amen I need his help one of my biggest
[1:59:27] praises help me Lord I need your help I
[1:59:30] can't do this I don't know how to work
[1:59:32] it out and my brain is too small I don't
[1:59:34] understand you know so we all need help
[1:59:37] and he wants to help us he's never too
[1:59:43] busy he ever doesn't care but the devil
[1:59:46] says he doesn't care
[1:59:47] well he doesn't care about the devil
[1:59:49] that's why the devil says he doesn't
[1:59:50] care who doesn't care about him he cares
[1:59:54] about you if he died for you he cares
[1:59:56] about you he cares for you cast all your
[1:59:59] cares upon him because he cares for you
[2:00:01] but then do you care enough to respond I
[2:00:04] mean so we have the privilege to apply
[2:00:07] the token to our families we have the
[2:00:10] privilege to apply it to ourselves I
[2:00:13] mean to get the slothfulness get the
[2:00:15] dross get the laziness get the
[2:00:16] indifference out of our lives I mean we
[2:00:18] can spend hours on this but what about
[2:00:21] talking him what about in his word I
[2:00:23] mean when I first met the Lord and I was
[2:00:27] single I'd such a burden the Lord just
[2:00:32] opened the door in Papua New Guinea I
[2:00:34] was just listening to sermons all the
[2:00:36] time Oh hallelujah
[2:00:38] I see
[2:00:39] eating it up I was printing books I was
[2:00:41] doing things work because I but I was
[2:00:43] just you know I don't know I didn't care
[2:00:45] what my flatmates sort of me I was just
[2:00:47] having a Jubilee why because there was a
[2:00:50] hunger we should have that kind of
[2:00:53] hunger hallelujah
[2:00:55] shouldn't we is that well that's being
[2:00:57] too spiritual I don't think we can be
[2:00:59] too spiritual I mean if you want to help
[2:01:01] your family just get more spiritual
[2:01:03] because he'll make your make your nature
[2:01:05] more like his I mean that then when
[2:01:07] trouble comes into the house maybe the
[2:01:09] day before you were you just jumped on
[2:01:11] the bandwagon but after you meet him and
[2:01:13] you know you're a spiritual frame of
[2:01:15] mind your hold on and you can be that
[2:01:17] you can be the one who's the peacemaker
[2:01:19] you can be the one that brings the
[2:01:21] reconciliation hallelujah but we have
[2:01:24] the privilege to apply the token to
[2:01:26] ourselves apply it to our families apply
[2:01:29] it to our house and we should have a
[2:01:31] zeal and it's not just laying down the
[2:01:34] law it's producing a life I mean there
[2:01:37] God comes down into your home hallelujah
[2:01:41] and then when he comes down then what
[2:01:42] happens hey hallelujah
[2:01:44] then then things can change because the
[2:01:47] void oh you know she'll kick stuff out
[2:01:51] but don't you stay there amen
[2:01:55] they should be a zeal Lord I want you to
[2:01:57] live every day I want you to manifest
[2:02:00] yourself in my life I don't just want to
[2:02:02] I just don't want to go from Sunday to
[2:02:04] Wednesday to Sunday and everything in
[2:02:05] between
[2:02:06] no may the zeal of thine house eat me up
[2:02:10] hallelujah that's how we need to be wish
[2:02:14] ever we should have such a burden for
[2:02:17] one another Allu yeah well how they
[2:02:22] doing and you know asking just because
[2:02:24] of gossip how are they doing and then
[2:02:27] you can just get such a burden for
[2:02:28] someone you don't even know what they're
[2:02:29] going through
[2:02:30] and you find out now going through a
[2:02:32] great big thing and the Lord help them
[2:02:34] why why do you put the burn on your
[2:02:36] heart there's a zeal there's a love
[2:02:38] there's a concern yeah there's nothing
[2:02:42] wrong with saying I'm worried about you
[2:02:43] how you doing amen shouldn't we be that
[2:02:47] way
