[47:29] the lily of the valleys as the Lily
[47:32] among Thorns so my lovers among the
[47:35] daughters as the apple tree among the
[47:37] Trees of the wood so is my beloved among
[47:39] the sons I sat down under his shadow
[47:42] with great delight and his fruit was
[47:44] sweet to my taste he brought me to his
[47:46] banqueting table and His Banner Over Me
[47:48] was love stay with me flaggin Comfort me
[47:51] with apples for I am sick of love has
[47:55] has left hand is under my head and his
[47:57] right hand does embrace me I charge you
[48:00] oh you Daughters of Jerusalem by the
[48:02] rose and by the Hinds of the field that
[48:04] you stir not up nor awake my love till
[48:08] he pleased the voice of my beloved
[48:10] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[48:12] mountain skipping upon the hills my
[48:15] beloved is like a row or a young heart
[48:17] behold he standeth behind our wall he
[48:20] lookth forth at the window showing
[48:22] himself through the lattice my beloved
[48:24] spake and said to me rise up my love my
[48:27] fair one and come away for Lo the winter
[48:30] has passed and the rain is over and gone
[48:33] the flowers appear on the earth uh the
[48:35] time of singing of birds has come and
[48:37] the voice of the turtle which is the
[48:39] turtle do has heard in our land the Fig
[48:41] Tre putteth forth her green figs and the
[48:43] vines uh with the tender grapes give a
[48:46] good smell Arise My Love My Fair one

[48:55] of the the stairs let me see thy
[48:58] countenance let me hear thy voice for
[49:00] sweet is thy voice and th countenance is
[49:04] comely and we'll go to Amos chapter
[49:11] 8 I'm going to read verse um we're going
[49:14] to read verses 11 down to verse 13 and
[49:17] this is quite a contrast but I want
[49:20] to um just take a thought from these and
[49:24] then we'll then you can have your seat
[49:26] so so Amos 11 I mean 8 Amos 8:
[49:32] 11 wait I'm in
[49:41] Hosea okay so it says here behold the
[49:44] days come sayith the Lord God remember
[49:46] we read he brought me to his Banting
[49:48] table and His Banner Over Me was love
[49:50] behold the days come sayith the Lord God
[49:52] that I will send a famine in the land
[49:54] not a famine of bread nor of thirst for
[49:57] water but of hearing the words of the
[50:00] Lord and they shall Wander from sea to
[50:02] Sea and from North even to the East and
[50:05] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[50:07] word of the Lord and shall not find it
[50:10] and that day shall the fair virgins and
[50:13] young men faint for thirst amen may the
[50:16] Lord bless the reading of his word you
[50:17] may be
[50:19] seated now this is a bit of a I know
[50:22] it's two very contrasting scriptures cuz
[50:24] one we have a banqueting T I mean no he
[50:26] brought me to his banqueting house he
[50:28] brought me to the banqueting house and
[50:30] His Banner Over Me was love so one's a
[50:32] banquet and the other we're speaking of
[50:35] a place where there's a famine not for
[50:37] not for bread or water so not for
[50:40] natural food but of hearing the words of
[50:43] the Lord and
[50:45] so I want to you know people I don't
[50:49] know if you've really maybe you've
[50:50] realized maybe this is just me but I
[50:52] really want to try and emphasize today
[50:54] you know we have visitors come where
[50:56] have people come and they say it's so
[50:59] wonderful and what you have is so
[51:01] special and it's such a blessing to be
[51:03] here you know and they travel thousands
[51:06] of miles from from other continents and
[51:08] they come here to this little place I
[51:10] say it's so nice now the this doesn't
[51:13] make this place special but it's
[51:16] wherever the banqueting hous is amen
[51:18] amen that's where there's the refreshing
[51:20] that's where there's the feast but the
[51:23] reason that people have to travel such
[51:24] great vast
[51:25] distances is because there is a famine
[51:27] in the land and it's not for bread or
[51:30] water there's plenty of bread or water I
[51:32] read a report the other day that the
[51:34] Earth right now it produces
[51:37] 120% of the food that the world actually
[51:40] needs but the problem is it's it's the
[51:42] distribution of the food which causes
[51:44] the problems but the Earth is producing
[51:46] the way more food 7 billion people upon
[51:49] the Earth and it's producing more than 7
[51:51] billion people need so it's not a famine
[51:53] for bread or water but it's that's
[51:55] hearing the words of the Lord but so
[51:57] it's not it's not it's not a famine for
[52:00] having Bibles or it's not famine for
[52:03] having Bible schools or theology or some
[52:06] understanding or churches but it's
[52:08] hearing the words of the Lord hallelujah
[52:10] amen that is the famine where there's
[52:13] very few places there's a a spiritual
[52:15] famine upon the land is because the
[52:17] words of the Lord are not heard the
[52:19] words of the Bible school might be heard
[52:21] or the Social Gospel but the words of
[52:23] the Lord that that that is
[52:25] famine and that's why when people
[52:28] travel amen hey I'm just showing you
[52:31] this scripture you've seen it lived out
[52:34] where people come to a place like this
[52:35] or go to any any church where Believers
[52:37] are where the word of God has preached
[52:39] that's so nice here it's so refreshing
[52:41] it's so wonderful why because they're
[52:44] walking through a desert Place amen and
[52:46] then they come to an
[52:48] oasis and they can sit down under the
[52:50] under the shade trees and then brother
[52:53] Bram says it's like the rest of you know
[52:55] you know he preaches a sermon on the
[52:57] restoration of the brid tree and he goes
[52:59] into Joel how that same bug in different
[53:01] stages eats down that eats down the
[53:04] Plant and and in four stages we won't go
[53:06] into it but but you can go read it and
[53:08] listen to this sermon and then he says
[53:10] part of that that so so the devil over
[53:13] the process of time has taken different
[53:15] things out of the church and one of them
[53:17] was the brotherly love the brotherly
[53:19] kindness you know the fellowship and
[53:21] when do you normally have Fellowship
[53:22] where it's nice and cool and relaxing
[53:26] amen we can have a rest under a big big
[53:28] Shady Tree he said the devil's chewed
[53:31] that out of the church that's right but
[53:33] God said I will restore amen and then so
[53:36] people come they say it's so nice why
[53:38] they found a shap tree amen they found a
[53:40] place where there's Fellowship people
[53:42] can actually have
[53:43] Fellowship amen they've been in a
[53:46] desert and
[53:48] so there was a famine in the land
[53:53] now this I just just I just pray the
[53:56] Lord help me again this week but we are
[54:00] living in a
[54:01] time where there's this
[54:04] famine and if there's a famine but but
[54:07] there is a banqueting
[54:09] table and so now what it is now it's not
[54:13] because we've conjured something up or
[54:14] because we're something special but it's
[54:17] because God has opened a stor House of
[54:19] his food spiritual food remember man
[54:22] shall not live by bread alone but every
[54:25] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[54:27] doesn't mean people live by theology or
[54:30] man shall live by just reading scripture
[54:34] now don't get me wrong here you need the
[54:36] Bible but you need the right
[54:38] interpretation of the Bible Jesus said
[54:40] searchy scriptures for in them you think
[54:43] you have eternal life and they are they
[54:45] which testify of me so they had the
[54:47] Bible they read the Bible they knew the
[54:49] Bible but they had no idea really they
[54:51] they couldn't actually access what was
[54:53] in the Bible
[54:55] is this okay you're following me so so
[54:58] they couldn't actually so they thought
[55:00] they had eternal life because they could
[55:03] read what Moses wrote or they could read
[55:05] what Ezekiel even what Amos
[55:07] wrote and and they thought they had
[55:09] eternal life but they didn't have
[55:11] eternal life even though they could
[55:13] quote the
[55:14] scripture amen amen so even in Jesus's
[55:18] day they had the synagogues they had the
[55:20] temple they had the priests they had the
[55:23] Pharisees the Sadducees they had the
[55:25] Bible written out they could go to the
[55:27] synagogue they could you know and
[55:29] apparently people could read a lot in
[55:31] those days so they could even read the
[55:33] Torah but it didn't give them eternal
[55:36] life amen they were still those people
[55:39] if you could and if you go to this day
[55:42] people are emaciated starving to death
[55:45] spiritually in this world cuz there's a
[55:49] famine and so it's more than just
[55:51] reading the Bible but then you need to
[55:53] read the Bible cuz you got to give God
[55:55] something to work with as I said a
[55:57] couple of Sundays Go's like an athlete
[55:59] and his coach you know berates the you
[56:01] know the guy he fails the race or he
[56:03] can't even finish the race and the coach
[56:05] says you're useless you're worthless why
[56:07] didn't you even finish the race and the
[56:08] athlete could say hey you're my coach
[56:12] did you train me no did you give me the
[56:15] right diet no you didn't give me
[56:17] anything to work
[56:18] with amen so it's the same thing you got
[56:21] to give God something to work with you
[56:23] got to that's why you need to read the
[56:25] word and listen to the word and pray you
[56:28] know brother B was asked a question how
[56:29] do you become a better Christian read
[56:31] the Bible and pray every
[56:33] day amen you got to give God something
[56:35] to work with you got to feed your soul
[56:38] amen if you if you don't feed your body
[56:40] you're going to wither up and die and
[56:42] you won't have strength to do anything
[56:44] it's the same thing the spirit of God
[56:46] feeds on the word so the spirit in you I
[56:49] trust you have the Holy Ghost it feeds
[56:51] on the
[56:52] word amen and if you and normally people
[56:56] that are growing they eat more than they
[56:58] need yeah plants drinking more water
[57:01] than they need and they drink they just
[57:03] push out more limbs yeah so it's the
[57:06] same thing with the believer you want to
[57:07] grow just drink and then push out the
[57:09] life in you will grow amen amen now I
[57:14] trust this doesn't this comes out okay
[57:17] but so we're in this famine time and
[57:21] that's why people go to and fro and
[57:23] there's a famine not for churches
[57:25] not for watching sermons on the internet
[57:27] you know there's more this world is more
[57:29] saturated with Christianity than it ever
[57:31] has been in the history of the world it
[57:34] is more because of the internet because
[57:36] of social media because just churches
[57:38] everywhere you can go on YouTube you can
[57:40] you can spend your entire life watching
[57:43] sermons but then you got to look at now
[57:45] what are they feeding on that they're
[57:47] giving to the people what food are these
[57:49] people feeding and then you look at the
[57:52] condition now remember you say well
[57:54] that's judging no you should be able to
[57:55] weigh up if I walk in here and tell you
[57:59] that Jesus isn't real we've believed a
[58:02] lie my whole testimon is wrong this is
[58:04] not a real he's not the same yesterday
[58:06] today and forever you would you would
[58:08] think something's wrong with me amen but
[58:11] then other people say well you just
[58:13] judging the preacher no you're just
[58:14] being Discerning you should be able to
[58:16] judge is this person dangerous or is he
[58:19] my friend is he here to help me or is he
[58:21] here to destroy me amen and then so you
[58:25] look at the concentration camps in World
[58:27] War II you would look at those guards
[58:29] and say those guards have been
[58:31] mistreating these people but then you
[58:33] can take that thing over to Christianity
[58:35] and people say you just judging those
[58:37] people you have no right to judge the
[58:38] ministry but look at what they're
[58:41] producing amen and then of course this
[58:43] Falls very much on my lap too what is
[58:45] being produced cuz what is sown what you
[58:48] s you'll reap so you're not going to if
[58:51] you seow pumpkin seeds you're not going
[58:53] to get wheat that's right if you sew
[58:56] pumpkin seeds you get
[58:58] pumpkins 100% of the time every time you
[59:01] sew potato you get potato and you
[59:04] shouldn't be surprised when you get
[59:06] potatoes I was expecting a pumpkin well
[59:08] what did you s a potato how can you
[59:11] expect the pumpkin that's right yeah so
[59:14] it's the same thing if you have the word
[59:15] of God if you can hear the word of the
[59:17] Lord and that is sewn in your life what
[59:20] are you going to get out you're are
[59:22] going to get that word manifested in you
[59:24] hallelujah amen but if you're living on
[59:27] a McDonald's diet spiritually you're
[59:30] going to become like the super siiz me
[59:32] guy very
[59:34] quickly amen and then people are shocked
[59:37] when they're you know but that is that
[59:40] is a spiritual condition of this world
[59:42] is a
[59:43] famine and unfortunately it's not the
[59:47] the people are sincere in that system
[59:49] doesn't matter you go Hong to the
[59:51] Catholic Church the whole Spectrum it's
[59:54] the it's it's not the people it's the
[59:56] system that's holding the people back
[59:58] many very sincere people in all those
[1:00:01] places very sincere maybe even more
[1:00:03] sincere than us but yet and they think
[1:00:07] they're contacting God by going to those
[1:00:09] places every church every church people
[1:00:11] would go I got to worship God doesn't
[1:00:14] matter what form it's in but they
[1:00:16] believe that's why people go to church I
[1:00:18] trust is to worship the true and living
[1:00:19] God and so they're sincere when they go
[1:00:22] but you see what is produced after they
[1:00:25] go to that
[1:00:26] place amen is it the character and
[1:00:28] nature of God that can cope with his
[1:00:31] word or is it just a reflection of
[1:00:34] whatever is coming over the
[1:00:36] pulpit
[1:00:39] amen so I can say there's a famine
[1:00:43] because if there wasn't a famine the
[1:00:46] world would be a very different
[1:00:48] place amen if the whole world heard the
[1:00:51] word of the Lord you say well why
[1:00:54] doesn't the whole world world he it it's
[1:00:56] because they had an
[1:00:58] opportunity and many times it's not this
[1:01:01] generation it's always now I may be
[1:01:03] jumping around a bit but I trust you
[1:01:05] just keep my training thought the people
[1:01:07] in this day and churches out there that
[1:01:10] are starving it's actually not their
[1:01:13] fault they're in that condition it's
[1:01:15] many times the generation of leaders
[1:01:17] before them which have rejected the
[1:01:20] truth and they what what what they swed
[1:01:23] these people are creeping you can see it
[1:01:25] in Jesus's day Paul said to the scribes
[1:01:28] and Pharisees this thing wasn't done in
[1:01:30] a corner of jesus' ministry you
[1:01:32] know fully well what happened and they
[1:01:34] did but they rejected the Prince of Life
[1:01:37] and then it was what 60 odd years later
[1:01:39] is when Jerusalem was burned and the
[1:01:41] people were massacred where when when
[1:01:44] Titus surrounded the city and and it was
[1:01:46] just before the Passover and they let
[1:01:48] all the Jews come in to worship and then
[1:01:51] they sealed up the place and they burned
[1:01:52] it with fire and murdered a whole bunch
[1:01:54] of them massacred the whole place so
[1:01:56] they reaped what their forebears sow
[1:02:00] remember Jesus said not one of these
[1:02:01] stones will be left upon another speak
[1:02:03] of the temple he said this will happen
[1:02:05] you read Matthew 24 but it was the
[1:02:07] future Generations that were reaping
[1:02:09] what the previous ones were SE it amen
[1:02:12] and so if you see why is there a famine
[1:02:15] is because the previous generations of
[1:02:17] leadership rejected the very Prince of
[1:02:20] Life and these this generation is
[1:02:23] suffering
[1:02:25] amen hey it is what it is it is what it
[1:02:28] is and you can see it you can take you
[1:02:30] take I'll just say you you you take the
[1:02:32] elim the New Life elim Church here in
[1:02:35] New Zealand they had a meeting maybe 30
[1:02:38] years ago in Christ Church what shall we
[1:02:40] do with this
[1:02:41] message and they and they came to the
[1:02:44] conclusion burn the books tell everyone
[1:02:46] that they he's a false prophet and
[1:02:48] that's what they did so they had the
[1:02:52] opportunity but they burnt it they they
[1:02:54] crucified the word
[1:02:56] again amen and that's exactly remember
[1:03:00] Revelations 3 l seeing Church age behold
[1:03:03] I stand at the door and
[1:03:05] knock now many Evangelical you your
[1:03:08] evangelist knock at your heart and that
[1:03:10] is true but the true interpretation of
[1:03:13] that scripture is actually he's on the
[1:03:14] outside of his church knocking trying to
[1:03:17] get
[1:03:18] in he's been rejected how do you kick
[1:03:21] someone out you got to reject them
[1:03:23] please leave my house now you're not
[1:03:24] welcome here
[1:03:25] anymore and that's exactly what happened
[1:03:28] if it happened at his first coming it
[1:03:31] happened at his second coming the word
[1:03:33] has been rejected and so if he remember
[1:03:36] he said to the said to the Jews I I am
[1:03:40] the bread of life that come down from
[1:03:41] heaven cuz cuz remember they said our
[1:03:44] fathers ate man in the wilderness we
[1:03:46] drank from the smitten rock and all
[1:03:47] these things he says I am that bread I
[1:03:50] am the bread that came down from heaven
[1:03:52] so here is the bread he is the bread of
[1:03:55] life is he not amen amen he is the bread
[1:03:58] of life so if you if you remove the very
[1:04:01] one thing you need to eat to spiritually
[1:04:03] live and grow what is your diet going to
[1:04:05] be it's not going to be growing like you
[1:04:08] should be it'll be a
[1:04:10] substitute and the substitute never
[1:04:12] produces what the real should be amen
[1:04:16] amen now I just pray by the end of the
[1:04:19] service you appreciate a whole lot more
[1:04:22] what God has allowed you to partake
[1:04:25] in this end
[1:04:26] time now so there is a famine now let's
[1:04:30] go to Genesis chapter
[1:04:34] 3 now this may end up a lot different to
[1:04:37] how I envisioned it but
[1:04:42] that's Genesis chapter 3 the end of the
[1:04:53] chapter
[1:04:56] so we'll just read verse 22 we'll read
[1:04:58] down and the Lord God said behold the
[1:05:01] man has become as one of us to know good
[1:05:04] and evil and now least he put forth his
[1:05:07] hand and take also of the tree of life
[1:05:09] and eat and live forever therefore the
[1:05:12] Lord God sent him forth from the Garden
[1:05:14] of Eden to till the ground from whence
[1:05:16] he was taken so he drove out the man and
[1:05:19] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[1:05:21] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:05:24] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:05:28] tree of life so notice it says least he
[1:05:31] put forth and take the tree of life so
[1:05:33] he had actually man had never actually
[1:05:35] partaken of that tree yet say lest he
[1:05:38] has and then notice the cherubim and the
[1:05:42] Flaming sword was put there to not to
[1:05:44] keep the tree of life but to keep the
[1:05:47] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[1:05:50] so the access to the tree of life has
[1:05:52] been kept yeah
[1:05:54] it's a big difference from keeping and
[1:05:56] keeping the way so the way has been kept
[1:06:01] so the access to the tree of life has
[1:06:03] been kept now remember the Tree of Life
[1:06:06] the tree of life is Jesus Christ yeah
[1:06:09] because there's only one source of
[1:06:11] eternal life amen amen amen so there's
[1:06:14] only one source of eternal life and that
[1:06:16] is Jesus Christ now so therefore I can
[1:06:18] say the tree of life is Jesus Christ and
[1:06:21] so now the way the way to access eternal
[1:06:26] life has been
[1:06:29] kept and now I just want to make a big
[1:06:32] jump let's go to let's go to Ezekiel
[1:06:34] chapter 10 I'm just going to read some
[1:06:36] scriptures and then
[1:06:39] we'll I want to show
[1:06:41] you that this
[1:06:44] cherubim because the way the way has
[1:06:47] been kept all the way down through from
[1:06:49] Genesis to today the way is being
[1:06:53] kept and many people may you may hear
[1:06:56] this and say well it's not fair everyone
[1:06:58] has a right to go in don't look at it
[1:07:00] that way you say thank God I have access
[1:07:03] thank God I'm allowed to go
[1:07:04] in amen so Ezekiel chapter 10 and we'll
[1:07:09] read from verse
[1:07:14] one and then I looked and beheld in the
[1:07:18] firmament that was above the head of the
[1:07:21] cherubims were appeared over them as it
[1:07:23] were a SA fir Stone as the appearance of
[1:07:26] a of the likeness of a throne and he
[1:07:29] spake unto the son I mean sorry unto the
[1:07:32] man clothed with linen said go in
[1:07:34] Between the Wheels which are under the
[1:07:35] Cherub and fill thine hand with Co of
[1:07:38] fire uh from between the cherubims and
[1:07:41] Scattered them over the city and he went
[1:07:44] um and he went in in my sight and now
[1:07:47] the cherubim stood on the right side of
[1:07:49] the house and when the man went in the
[1:07:51] cloud filled the inner Court then the
[1:07:53] glor glory of the Lord went up from the
[1:07:55] Cherub and stood over the threshold of
[1:07:57] the house and the house was filled with
[1:07:59] the cloud and the court was full of the
[1:08:02] brightness of the Lord's glory and the
[1:08:04] sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard
[1:08:07] even to the outer Court as the voice of
[1:08:10] the almighty God when he speaketh and it
[1:08:13] came to pass that when he had commanded
[1:08:16] the man clothed with linen saying take
[1:08:18] fire from between the wheels from
[1:08:21] between the cherubims then he went in
[1:08:23] and stood beside the wheels and one
[1:08:25] cherub stretched forth his hand from
[1:08:27] between the cherubims unto the fire
[1:08:29] which was between the cherubims and took
[1:08:32] thereof and put it into the hands of him
[1:08:34] that was clothed with linen who took it
[1:08:36] and went out and there appeared in the
[1:08:39] cherubs cherubims the form of a man's
[1:08:41] hand under their wings and when I looked
[1:08:44] and beheld the Four Wheels by the
[1:08:46] cherubims one wheel by one cherub and
[1:08:48] another Wheel by another cherub and the
[1:08:50] appearance of the wheels as it were the
[1:08:52] color uh of a barrel Stone and as for
[1:08:56] their
[1:08:57] appearances they four had one likeness
[1:09:01] as if a wheel had been in the midst of a
[1:09:03] wheel when they went they went upon
[1:09:05] their four sides they turned not as they
[1:09:08] went but to the place where the the head
[1:09:10] looked they followed it and they turned
[1:09:13] not as they went and their whole body
[1:09:16] and their backs and their hands and
[1:09:17] their wings and the wheels were full of
[1:09:20] eyes round about even the wheels uh that
[1:09:24] they for had as for the wheels and it
[1:09:27] Cried unto them in my hearing oh whe and
[1:09:31] every face everyone had four faces now
[1:09:34] this is where I really want to get to
[1:09:36] here everyone had four faces the first
[1:09:39] face was a face of a cherub the second
[1:09:42] was the face of a man the fourth uh the
[1:09:46] face of a lion I sorry the third the
[1:09:48] face of a lion and the fourth the face
[1:09:52] of an eagle and and the cherubs were
[1:09:54] lifted up this is the living creature
[1:09:56] that I saw by the river Chiba now don't
[1:09:59] get I know that's a lot in there but
[1:10:02] this is the same being that he saw in
[1:10:04] chapter one because he's by the river
[1:10:06] chibar and he saw the same cherubim come
[1:10:08] out but you see now they have four
[1:10:11] faces they have a man a lion an
[1:10:17] eagle and then that face of a cherub now
[1:10:20] if we go to Revelations chap 4 that face
[1:10:23] actually the face of an
[1:10:24] ox
[1:10:26] okay so this cherub that had the that
[1:10:29] was protecting the way there in Genesis
[1:10:31] now Ezekiel sees it in a greater way
[1:10:34] here in Ezekiel well you can read
[1:10:36] chapter one but save time we won't and
[1:10:38] also chapter 10 he SE these cherubs here
[1:10:42] so then now these these cherubs they go
[1:10:45] from keeping the way there and then if
[1:10:48] we had time we could go into how Israel
[1:10:50] camped around the Tabernacle in the
[1:10:52] wilderness
[1:10:54] and then in the tabernac in the
[1:10:55] wilderness there were three tribes the
[1:10:58] north side three tribes on the south and
[1:11:00] the East and the west and there was a
[1:11:03] head tribe over each of those points and
[1:11:06] the banner on each tribe was a man and I
[1:11:08] a man a lion an ox and an
[1:11:12] eagle and so we're showing now for in
[1:11:14] order for someone to get into the
[1:11:16] Tabernacle where the prin of God was
[1:11:19] they had to fight their way through the
[1:11:20] armies of Israel so they had to be
[1:11:22] granted access
[1:11:24] through the the tribes in order to get
[1:11:26] to the tree of life you can say because
[1:11:28] it's his presence amen so it's always
[1:11:32] been protected where his life is
[1:11:33] remember his life is the Tree of Life
[1:11:35] Christ is the tree of life but the way
[1:11:37] is always been
[1:11:39] protected he following
[1:11:41] me okay so now let's go
[1:11:45] to let's go to Revelations chapter
[1:11:48] 4 now there going to be a bit of reading
[1:11:50] here but then we'll tie it all together
[1:11:58] now we got to Revelations chapter 4 and
[1:12:01] remember let's just read from verse
[1:12:05] one so it says after this I looked
[1:12:08] remember after this what the church ages
[1:12:09] now John is lifted up into an eternal
[1:12:12] realm so when the church age is over now
[1:12:15] there's a time where John is lifted up
[1:12:16] and sees Eternal things now we're still
[1:12:19] talking about spiritual
[1:12:21] food okay so after this I looked and
[1:12:23] beheld the door was open in heaven and
[1:12:26] remember that door remember John in the
[1:12:28] Book of Revelation is a symbol of the
[1:12:30] Bride yeah so at the end of the church
[1:12:32] ages he is raptured up so that he says
[1:12:35] now um after this I looked and beheld
[1:12:38] the door was open in heaven and the
[1:12:40] first voice which I heard as it were a
[1:12:44] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:12:46] up hither and I'll show you these things
[1:12:48] which must be Hereafter so the voice
[1:12:51] that spoke with him through the church
[1:12:52] ages now is speaking from heaven and
[1:12:54] he's lifted up from being in this realm
[1:12:57] into an eternal realm and immediately he
[1:12:59] AR in the spirit and beheld a throne was
[1:13:01] sit in heaven and one sat on the throne
[1:13:04] and he as it were to um and he that sat
[1:13:07] was to look upon like a Jasper and a
[1:13:09] siding Stone and there was a rainbow
[1:13:11] round about the throne in the sight um
[1:13:14] in sight like unto an emerald and round
[1:13:17] about the throne with 4 and 20 seats and
[1:13:20] upon the seats I Saw 4 and 20 Elders
[1:13:22] sitting clothed them with white rment
[1:13:24] and they had on their heads crowns of
[1:13:26] gold and out of the throne proceeded
[1:13:28] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:13:31] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:13:33] burning Before the Throne which are the
[1:13:35] seven spirits of God and Before the
[1:13:38] Throne there was a sea of glass like un
[1:13:41] Crystal and in the midst of the throne
[1:13:43] round about The Throne were four beasts
[1:13:46] and that is actually living creatures
[1:13:48] that word Beast there is living creature
[1:13:50] full of eyes before and behind which
[1:13:53] we've read about Ezekiel and the first
[1:13:55] Beast was like a lion the second beast
[1:13:57] was like a calf the third Beast had the
[1:13:59] face as a man and the fourth Beast was
[1:14:02] like a flying eagle and the four beasts
[1:14:05] had each of them six wings about them
[1:14:07] and they full of eyes within and they
[1:14:09] rest not day and night saying holy holy
[1:14:12] holy Lord God Almighty which was and is
[1:14:16] and is to
[1:14:18] come now so the cherubim
[1:14:22] now is now here in Revelations chapter
[1:14:27] 4 and then if we go into Revelations
[1:14:30] chapter 6 I want to show you now when
[1:14:32] the seals are open and the Antichrist
[1:14:34] rides forth it says I well let's just
[1:14:38] read
[1:14:40] it uh Revelation chapter 6 and verse
[1:14:43] one and I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:14:46] of the
[1:14:47] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[1:14:49] of Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:14:52] come and see
[1:14:54] now we'll go down to verse three and
[1:14:56] when he had opened the second seal I
[1:14:58] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:15:00] remember this Beast this word Beast is
[1:15:02] living creatures living creatures and
[1:15:04] when I heard the third when he opened
[1:15:07] the third seal verse 5 I heard the third
[1:15:10] Beast say come and see okay and then now
[1:15:13] we go down to the fourth seal which is
[1:15:15] verse S and when he had opened the
[1:15:18] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:15:20] fourth Beast say come and see well are
[1:15:23] these four beasts we read about them in
[1:15:24] Revelations chapter 4 there the first
[1:15:26] was like a lion the second beast was
[1:15:29] like a cal there's a cheram speaking now
[1:15:32] the third Beast had the face as a man
[1:15:34] and the fourth beast beast pardon me was
[1:15:36] like a flying
[1:15:38] eagle now when the Antichrist power rid
[1:15:42] forth like in the first seal there that
[1:15:45] was the Antichrist Spirit moving forth
[1:15:47] to conquer the church through deception
[1:15:49] yeah and so now to combat that God said
[1:15:53] sent an anointing of the lion upon the
[1:15:55] church to overcome the false doctrine
[1:15:57] that was coming forth yeah and so every
[1:16:01] time and then after that that second
[1:16:03] seal now instead of a a Antichrist
[1:16:06] Spirit of deception riding
[1:16:08] forth then there's a then then the rider
[1:16:11] went on to a red horse and was given a
[1:16:13] big sword and he and
[1:16:15] he and came out another horse that was
[1:16:18] red and power was given to him that sat
[1:16:20] there on to take peace from the earth
[1:16:21] that they should kill one another and
[1:16:22] then was given unto him a great sword so
[1:16:25] went from a false false Doctrine coming
[1:16:27] in a deception coming in and then when
[1:16:30] after the Council of NAIA when church
[1:16:31] and state were United then the church
[1:16:34] had the power of the state to use the
[1:16:36] the state's armies to to kill its
[1:16:39] enemy yep so and you go look in
[1:16:43] history there goes a time where it was a
[1:16:45] false Doctrine comes in and then there's
[1:16:47] a massive persecution what is that now
[1:16:49] he's killing with the sword yeah but
[1:16:52] then the church was anointed because
[1:16:55] that second beast had the face of a of a
[1:16:58] cal yeah so now what is a c it's a beast
[1:17:01] of burden it's a beast of sacrifice so
[1:17:05] the Believers were anointed same Holy
[1:17:07] Spirit in a different way that they
[1:17:09] could easily you read the fox's book of
[1:17:11] Mars you read about the people in the
[1:17:13] that were in the uh Coliseum they were
[1:17:16] so happy that they could suffer and die
[1:17:19] for their Lord's sake they just rejoiced
[1:17:20] in it why is that because our anointed
[1:17:23] in such a way that they could overcome
[1:17:25] what the enemy was doing amen so so the
[1:17:29] Lord sent a power to combat what the
[1:17:32] enemy was doing and that was to protect
[1:17:34] the way of the tree of life amen okay
[1:17:37] Amen to protect the way this all coming
[1:17:40] together and then you can even and then
[1:17:43] and all the way down through that's why
[1:17:44] there's the four beasts so whenever the
[1:17:46] enemy is doing something God anoints the
[1:17:48] church in a certain way to protect the
[1:17:51] way of the tree of life and also that
[1:17:52] that the church will overcome what the
[1:17:54] enemy is doing remember to him that
[1:17:56] overcometh every Pro every age is given
[1:17:59] a promise to him that overcometh I'll
[1:18:01] give you this and our promise is to him
[1:18:03] that overcometh you'll sit in my Throne
[1:18:05] as I've sat down on my father's throne
[1:18:07] and that overcoming is not just
[1:18:09] overcoming smoking drinking the world
[1:18:11] whatever that overcoming is to overcome
[1:18:13] what the enemy is doing in this age can
[1:18:16] you overcome the Antichrist spirit amen
[1:18:19] amen that is the overcoming if you can
[1:18:21] withstand what the is doing let's all be
[1:18:24] one let's just have a Social Gospel
[1:18:26] let's go back to Rome that's what the
[1:18:29] world is pushing nowadays right and so
[1:18:32] can you overcome because it looks so
[1:18:34] good there's going to be Unity again
[1:18:36] it's been nearly over over a thousand
[1:18:38] years there's been a split and
[1:18:39] everyone's coming back together and we
[1:18:41] can christianize the whole world look at
[1:18:44] the resources that's on tap it looks so
[1:18:46] good but can you overcome it can you
[1:18:49] overcome oh just just just relax and
[1:18:52] just you know become one of us don't be
[1:18:55] so crazy that's right we live in a
[1:18:58] modern era things have moved on the
[1:19:00] gospel's moved on you got to stay
[1:19:02] relevant to stay with the times no you
[1:19:04] don't you preach the real word and then
[1:19:07] the power that's in that word will
[1:19:08] affect the people and it'll change them
[1:19:11] amen if it's not the word keeping us
[1:19:13] nothing can remember he is the word amen
[1:19:16] so we don't have to try and work it out
[1:19:18] just believe what he has done and what
[1:19:20] he has sent and it will produce what God
[1:19:23] wants to produce remember this word has
[1:19:26] a life of its own I don't know if you
[1:19:28] realized that but Jesus Christ has his
[1:19:31] own agenda he has what he wants done he
[1:19:34] he's not interested in what you want
[1:19:35] done he wants what he wants done and
[1:19:38] then those that can overcome yield their
[1:19:40] will to his will not my will but thy
[1:19:42] will be done amen if that's what Jesus
[1:19:45] said it's sure what you've got to have
[1:19:46] in your heart too amen not my will but
[1:19:49] thy will be done and if you can do that
[1:19:52] then you can overcome amen amen hey the
[1:19:55] gospel doesn't change doesn't matter
[1:19:58] it's it it's unpopular today it was
[1:20:01] unpopular then and it'll always be
[1:20:06] unpopular so
[1:20:11] now God anoints his church to overcome
[1:20:13] what's happening in the
[1:20:15] age and then and then he also does that
[1:20:18] he anoints it a certain way because he's
[1:20:19] protecting the way to the tree of life
[1:20:21] and so there's an anointing comes upon
[1:20:23] the Earth and those people that are
[1:20:26] granted access I trust you can say I'm
[1:20:29] one of them amen if this if this coming
[1:20:34] to church is all all to you is just
[1:20:36] hearing something and learning something
[1:20:38] new maybe singing a nice song you've
[1:20:40] missed the whole thing I mean you've
[1:20:43] missed the whole thing but if it's life
[1:20:44] to you and you can say from from
[1:20:47] whenever you first heard the truth
[1:20:49] Something's Happened to you and God is
[1:20:51] transforming you then I can say you've
[1:20:54] been granted access if something's
[1:20:56] happened to you and now your life has
[1:20:57] been changed you've been granted
[1:20:59] access amen amen and you can even see it
[1:21:03] in the gospels you can see the four
[1:21:06] cherums in the gospels Matthew is
[1:21:09] written different to Mark it's different
[1:21:11] it's written different to Luke it's
[1:21:12] written different to John and people say
[1:21:14] that's just the personality of the
[1:21:15] writer no it's not God anointed them to
[1:21:18] write in such a way you can see Matthew
[1:21:20] you can see the lion anointing the word
[1:21:22] being fulfilled he did this that it
[1:21:24] might be fulfilled he was born here that
[1:21:26] it might be fulfilled this happened on
[1:21:28] this wise that it might be fulfilled and
[1:21:30] then and then Mark it just goes straight
[1:21:32] into his Works straight into his doings
[1:21:34] what's that an ox works and then Luke is
[1:21:37] all man's Wisdom it's got a man
[1:21:39] anointing on it and then John is very
[1:21:41] different in the beginning was the word
[1:21:43] it's an eternal word it goes from
[1:21:45] eternity to Eternity why that's a that's
[1:21:48] a prophetic Eagle anointing upon the
[1:21:50] Book of John it's very different
[1:21:53] why because now but that is only
[1:21:56] protecting how does it protect you take
[1:21:59] Matthew
[1:22:00] 28:19 that is put in
[1:22:03] there to protect the way to the there's
[1:22:06] there's word there's things that are
[1:22:08] scripture being put in the word to
[1:22:09] protect the way of the Tree of Life
[1:22:11] remember Jesus said in vain do you
[1:22:13] worship me teaching the Commandments and
[1:22:16] doctrines of men so if you teach the
[1:22:19] Commandments and doctrines of God then
[1:22:21] you'll receive what God has for you amen
[1:22:24] so Matthew 28:19 is put there and that
[1:22:27] is actually a gospel God because people
[1:22:30] just read it say well I need to get
[1:22:32] baptized in the name of father son Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost and they get baptized in
[1:22:36] titles amen those sincere I'm not
[1:22:39] questioning anyone's sincerity but they
[1:22:41] but they get baptized wrong but Jesus
[1:22:43] said enter you in at the Straight Gate
[1:22:46] St r a i t that's water straight like
[1:22:49] cook straight spelled the same way enter
[1:22:51] in at the water a gate there's only one
[1:22:54] gate to be baptized to be immersed in
[1:22:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:22:58] is the gate amen so if you try and go in
[1:23:01] at the wrong gate you're not going to be
[1:23:04] allowed in you're like banging at a at a
[1:23:06] wall TR well this is the way there's one
[1:23:08] door am that's why Peter said no Paul
[1:23:11] said one Lord One Faith one
[1:23:14] baptism amen so that that is a gospel
[1:23:17] God hallelujah amen and then even the
[1:23:19] prophet tells us you don't even need a
[1:23:21] revelation on the water B you just need
[1:23:24] to read the scripture and it it'll
[1:23:25] interpret itself but yet it's those who
[1:23:28] will humble themselves to the word and
[1:23:30] will yield themselves then God gives
[1:23:32] them access am
[1:23:35] hallelujah amen and there's so there the
[1:23:38] way has been protected so the way I'll
[1:23:42] say into the feast has been
[1:23:45] protected amen the way into the feast is
[1:23:47] being
[1:23:48] protected and
[1:23:50] so the way of the tree of life has
[1:23:53] always been
[1:23:55] kept
[1:23:57] now this is from the sermon the end time
[1:23:59] in
[1:24:01] 54 he says now let's all go way back to
[1:24:06] Adam and Eve cuz when they came out of
[1:24:08] the garden she bore two sons that we
[1:24:11] know first Cain then Abel two boys now
[1:24:14] these boys after seeing that they had
[1:24:15] made Mortal and was going to die they
[1:24:19] tried to find favor with God they both
[1:24:22] come making a sacrifice I'll review a
[1:24:24] certain thing here I said last night if
[1:24:26] God only required religion if that's all
[1:24:29] he required then Cain was justified
[1:24:32] pardon me Cain came just as believing
[1:24:35] just the same as Abel did Cain was a
[1:24:38] Believer amen Cain came with a sacrifice
[1:24:42] just the same as Abel came with a
[1:24:44] sacrifice but Cain's sacrifice was by
[1:24:47] works he raised his garden brought his
[1:24:49] fruits the best he could find by works
[1:24:52] but Abel was justified by faith he came
[1:24:55] with a lamb what you'll see where uh
[1:24:59] fanaticism began you'll see where every
[1:25:01] one of these Cults begin you'll see
[1:25:04] where all this confusion begin and by
[1:25:06] God's help May the Holy Ghost place it
[1:25:08] in every heart here this afternoon I say
[1:25:10] this morning so deeply they'll never
[1:25:12] come out now then Cain came and knelt
[1:25:15] down built an altar I'd imagine they'd
[1:25:18] come to the east side of the gate for
[1:25:20] there's where the angel stood with it
[1:25:22] flaming sword guarding the Tree of Life
[1:25:25] by the way he was guarding the people
[1:25:28] away from the Tree of Life B says now he
[1:25:32] trying to drive people back to the Tree
[1:25:35] of Life Jesus was our tree of life so
[1:25:40] now back then he was actually guarding
[1:25:42] the way to stop people coming but now
[1:25:45] that cherub's guarding the way is
[1:25:47] actually trying to drive men and women
[1:25:50] boys and girls into the Tree of Life
[1:25:52] amen and I trust if God has become real
[1:25:54] to you you can actually come to
[1:25:56] realization I was driven something
[1:26:00] something in spite of me drove me
[1:26:02] motivated me Amen to partake of the tree
[1:26:05] of life thank you Lord hallelujah amen
[1:26:07] that You' have been given access to this
[1:26:10] Feast
[1:26:12] Hallelujah and so now the
[1:26:15] way the way is being kept now you may
[1:26:18] say it's not fair why is the way kept
[1:26:20] some people granted some others that's
[1:26:21] God choosing but to me it's whosoever
[1:26:24] will let him come if you want to will if
[1:26:27] if if you will to come then come you
[1:26:30] know let's go a um let's go A Song of

[1:28:11] undone no if he's called you he's been
[1:28:13] you've been Justified what is Justified

[1:28:19] evidence prove that she's defiled and
[1:28:22] she's she's worthy of death prove it

[1:28:33] marriage please say something now maybe
[1:28:35] someone would have but she's a harlot
[1:28:38] she's a gentile she's a harlot she has
[1:28:40] no right to marry you he could have
[1:28:42] stood up and said remember he was a
[1:28:44] general he was in charge of the
[1:28:45] operation under
[1:28:47] Joshua he could have stood up and said
[1:28:49] prove it find the men find the men that
[1:28:54] did the ACT find
[1:28:56] them he took care of the
[1:28:59] evidence amen that there was nothing
[1:29:01] stopping her marrying him Hallelujah he
[1:29:04] took care of the evidence now if if
[1:29:06] Salomon could do that for a you know a
[1:29:09] man natural man could do it for a
[1:29:10] natural woman how much more a
[1:29:12] supernatural God Amen for his bride amen
[1:29:16] hallelujah hallelujah amen you got to
[1:29:19] look at what God you've been granted a
[1:29:21] great privilege in this day if you
[1:29:23] haven't recognized it God has given us a
[1:29:25] seven course meal he's laid out a
[1:29:28] banqueting house and he's bitten you
[1:29:31] he's been waiting for you to come to
[1:29:33] this banqueting house to partake of him
[1:29:36] he knows this world is in a in a in a
[1:29:38] famine he cused the famine that's right
[1:29:40] he allowed the famine to come but he's
[1:29:42] called you to come he's bitten you you
[1:29:45] look at things and take things for
[1:29:47] granted that the prophets of old were
[1:29:49] looking when is this going to happen you
[1:29:52] know Paul would have been under
[1:29:53] expectation when he wrote first
[1:29:55] Thessalonians chapter 4 they which are
[1:29:56] alive and remain should not prevent them
[1:29:59] which are asleep but th rise first then
[1:30:00] you'll go with them to meet the Lord in
[1:30:02] the air he would have been under
[1:30:04] expectation because the inspiration was
[1:30:06] fresh to him amen but he didn't know
[1:30:09] when it was going to be he was under
[1:30:11] expectation Timothy would have been
[1:30:13] under expectation amen at the end of his
[1:30:15] life it's been a Brethren it's been 40
[1:30:18] odd years since Paul wrote this to us
[1:30:21] where
[1:30:22] where're the generation amen amen amen
[1:30:26] but they didn't know what was going on
[1:30:28] and yet now here comes a messenger in
[1:30:30] our day remember when I heard the voice
[1:30:32] of the fourth Beast say come and see it
[1:30:35] doesn't say all it says for the first
[1:30:37] three is I heard that say come and see
[1:30:39] when I heard the voice of the fourth
[1:30:41] Beast say come and see amen so there's
[1:30:44] an emphasis on the
[1:30:46] voice yeah and so you can sit here or
[1:30:50] you can just push play stream someone
[1:30:53] teaching or you can just see it and you
[1:30:55] can see the whole word program of God
[1:30:57] come together and you look at things
[1:31:01] that other even Luther had no idea what
[1:31:03] you looking at Wesley had no idea the
[1:31:06] early Pentecostal church had no idea the
[1:31:08] early church had no idea amen that's
[1:31:11] right amen and you can just sit there
[1:31:12] and you can just feed off of it and you
[1:31:15] can you can not only hear the son of man
[1:31:17] being revealed but that same one now
[1:31:19] comes into your life you come under the
[1:31:22] anointing that was on the prophet comes
[1:31:24] upon you Hallelujah and that's causing
[1:31:27] you to partake amen of the spiritual
[1:31:30] Feast am cuz if you're not Anointed with
[1:31:32] the same Spirit how can you feed off
[1:31:34] that Living God amen amen how do I know
[1:31:37] I've been how do I know I've been given
[1:31:39] access because the same God you hear him
[1:31:42] speak about lives today and is not in
[1:31:45] someone else's life it's in your life
[1:31:48] Hallelujah that's how you know cuz he's
[1:31:49] a living God Amen amen amen and people
[1:31:53] give their lives and they study the
[1:31:55] Bible and they don't have the key and
[1:31:57] they don't understand how it goes
[1:31:59] together and they're sincere
[1:32:01] people they do people have given their
[1:32:04] lives unreservedly given themselves even
[1:32:08] more than we probably give ourselves to
[1:32:10] the word and they didn't have the key
[1:32:13] they don't have the
[1:32:15] key and they look and they try and put
[1:32:17] things together and they spend their
[1:32:18] mental energy trying to put it together
[1:32:22] they don't have the key and they don't
[1:32:24] understand and then you're just walking
[1:32:27] along living your old life thinking what
[1:32:30] oh this is my plan for the future and
[1:32:32] then God intersects that plan and says
[1:32:34] stop walking in this famine I'm going to
[1:32:36] I'm going to banqueting house it must be
[1:32:39] full hallelujah hallelujah and you just
[1:32:41] sit there and say well now now I
[1:32:42] understand this and it's not I'm not
[1:32:44] talking about understand here move this
[1:32:46] down here whatever you do amen but
[1:32:49] something anchors in your heart now I
[1:32:50] see I see who God is you know even even
[1:32:54] brother Bisal at early age he was at the
[1:32:56] height of Pentecost and he didn't know
[1:32:58] if God was one two or
[1:33:00] three cuz he was under the anointing of
[1:33:02] that age before he met brother bar he
[1:33:04] had no idea and he was it was like a and
[1:33:07] he was
[1:33:08] preaching amen because they didn't know
[1:33:11] is he cuz some say he's two some say
[1:33:14] he's three some say he's one how does it
[1:33:16] work but then now remember the voice of
[1:33:19] the fourth Beast Hallelujah said come
[1:33:21] and see and then so now he came under
[1:33:24] the that same anointing we've come under
[1:33:27] am me you can see God for who he really
[1:33:29] is don't take it for granted you can see
[1:33:31] God changes his form all the way down
[1:33:33] through let us make man in our image
[1:33:35] well what was God he was a m he was
[1:33:38] fully all all God was he had a hidden
[1:33:41] Mystery in him a bride amen and then
[1:33:44] when Adam was created Spirit form there
[1:33:46] was even him that was a
[1:33:48] mystery amen that's not so scary is it
[1:33:51] let us make man in our own image well
[1:33:54] what was man he was a spirit man with a
[1:33:56] woman hidden in him and that was God's
[1:34:00] image
[1:34:02] amen and people trip over up all those
[1:34:04] things and then now that image was put
[1:34:07] in a body and then Eve came out of Adam
[1:34:10] and that is the full manifestation of
[1:34:12] the mystery that was in Adam and then
[1:34:15] here you are oh it's just a story and no
[1:34:17] it's not a story God is repeating his
[1:34:20] Plan of Redemption but the thing is
[1:34:22] because we know the author of the book
[1:34:25] am mean we know the one who's laid out
[1:34:26] the banqueting house and bid you to come
[1:34:28] in because we know the author it all
[1:34:30] comes together perfect amen hallelujah
[1:34:33] and then now Eve came out of Adam and
[1:34:36] then when Jesus was on the cross
[1:34:38] remember there was a bride in a bride
[1:34:40] had to be expressed and then so when he
[1:34:43] was on the cross what came out of him
[1:34:45] water blood and spirit amen the three
[1:34:48] Essential Elements for life Hallelujah
[1:34:52] so you and remember it says in Hebrews
[1:34:56] Paul is saying that Levi was in the
[1:34:58] loins of Abraham when Abraham paid ties
[1:35:01] to
[1:35:02] malisic he wasn't saying it figuratively
[1:35:05] he was saying Levi was literally in the
[1:35:07] man you work it out he was in him amen
[1:35:11] when when when he paid tithes and
[1:35:14] because he was in him hang TI was
[1:35:17] attributed to Levi hallelujah amen so
[1:35:21] now because you were in Christ amen when
[1:35:24] he went to Calvary it's attributed to
[1:35:26] you amen hallelujah that's not a figure
[1:35:29] it's a literal thing that's right all
[1:35:31] the father has given me will come amen
[1:35:33] where do we come from we came out of him
[1:35:37] Hallelujah that's why he calls what is a
[1:35:39] son or a daughter they came out of the
[1:35:41] father Amen in the in the bedding ground
[1:35:43] of mother and then they came out but
[1:35:45] that the life that was in that's why you
[1:35:48] look at your children you see you I
[1:35:50] trust you can see you amen and
[1:35:51] mannerisms or how they look you can see
[1:35:54] yourself in them because they came out
[1:35:56] of you amen hallelujah that's the same
[1:36:00] thing with God you came out of him
[1:36:03] that's why Jesus said I came from God
[1:36:05] I'm going back to God and you can say
[1:36:07] the same thing hallelujah
[1:36:10] hallelujah hey it is what it is you came
[1:36:13] out of him that's why we could say when
[1:36:16] he was on the cross I was on his mind
[1:36:19] but more than just mentally on his mind
[1:36:20] I came out of him hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:24] what does the scripture say you know you
[1:36:26] he takes up a parable AA went to so the
[1:36:30] kingdom of God is like this AAU went to
[1:36:32] se sews out his wheat and then night
[1:36:37] time comes then another man comes out
[1:36:39] sews all the
[1:36:41] tears
[1:36:43] amen and then they both begin to grow
[1:36:47] then the question you you the workers
[1:36:49] say to the man who swed didn't you so
[1:36:51] good seed he said of course I did the
[1:36:53] enemy has done this amen and then so
[1:36:57] what happens is they say well should we
[1:36:58] pull out the wheed said no let it grow
[1:37:00] up to the Harvest and then when the
[1:37:02] Harvest has come then we'll gather the
[1:37:05] tears will be bound for the burning but
[1:37:08] the wheed is gathered to the Garner amen
[1:37:10] amen so the you know you you've seen the
[1:37:14] pictures the soul has got a big bag and
[1:37:15] he just throws it around
[1:37:18] amen it's the same thing remember the
[1:37:21] field Jesus interprets the the the um
[1:37:25] Parable you go read it he says the field
[1:37:27] is the world The Good Seed is the
[1:37:30] children you know children of God and
[1:37:33] the wheat is I mean the tears are the
[1:37:34] children of the wicked one he doesn't
[1:37:36] give any well I think it means this he
[1:37:38] says this is what it means so now the
[1:37:41] seed now if that's just natural but
[1:37:45] talking of in our families you say a so
[1:37:48] a soed what the life came out of the the
[1:37:51] SE and went into the ground and it
[1:37:53] brought forth the fruit amen
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:57] hallelujah amen so so the seed that he
[1:38:00] swed in the field is a part of him
[1:38:03] that's why he won't lose one of his
[1:38:06] right the Seal of God standers for sure
[1:38:08] he knows them that are his amen amen
[1:38:10] that's what the scripture tells us so he
[1:38:12] knows what's part of him and what's not
[1:38:15] part of
[1:38:16] him amen because if it wasn't for
[1:38:20] election we would be walking on ice all
[1:38:22] the day oh I hope I make it I hope I
[1:38:25] don't make it I hope I please him I hope
[1:38:26] I don't please him you know is this but
[1:38:29] no God's election stands sure that if
[1:38:33] you're one of his you're one of his if
[1:38:35] you make a mistake he'll make you pay
[1:38:37] sure cuz you reap what you sow but he
[1:38:40] won't leave you just going on that
[1:38:41] trajectory that's right amen he'll cause
[1:38:44] you if you're walking towards a cliff of
[1:38:46] Darkness he's going to make sure you
[1:38:47] don't step off that Cliff amen
[1:38:50] hallelujah and maybe be very costly to
[1:38:52] you but he'll be dital I'm not going to
[1:38:54] let you go that way hallelujah
[1:38:56] hallelujah you have confidence in God
[1:39:00] Amen have confidence in the seed friends
[1:39:03] oh my family's going sideways what are
[1:39:06] you looking at right as I said a couple
[1:39:08] of weeks ago lot did everything wrong he
[1:39:12] was the one called with the promise God
[1:39:14] met me and said let's go here I'm with
[1:39:16] you this sounds really neat and then
[1:39:18] things get a bit hard lot just wants a
[1:39:20] better kind of life backslides ends up
[1:39:22] in Sodom Abraham didn't let him you know
[1:39:25] he didn't let him just go in terms of
[1:39:29] you know he would have prayed for his
[1:39:31] nephew amen he would have lifted them
[1:39:33] into God's PR and and he knew lot had
[1:39:36] daughters all those children we can't
[1:39:37] let them grow up in that kind of place
[1:39:40] amen remember if Abraham didn't
[1:39:43] intercede lot would have been he would
[1:39:45] have been ashes
[1:39:47] too amen and so now we've been
[1:39:53] granted amen you got to think about it
[1:39:56] we have a privilege don't don't take it
[1:39:59] for granted the voice of the fourth
[1:40:01] Beast they're flying eagle and then
[1:40:03] brother bam says when the seals remember
[1:40:05] it's an anointing on the churches down
[1:40:07] through the church ages so the first age
[1:40:09] was anointed with the lion anointing the
[1:40:11] word went forth in a mighty way I mean
[1:40:14] to conquer what the enemy was doing but
[1:40:16] then now when the enemy had control over
[1:40:18] the state then they started to state was
[1:40:21] able to actually persecute the church
[1:40:23] like never before so the church was
[1:40:25] anointed with an ox beast of burden and
[1:40:27] sacrifice anointing and they gave
[1:40:29] themselves but then around the time of
[1:40:31] Martin Luther the manage anointing came
[1:40:35] and they built the printing press and
[1:40:37] you see the reformers you know you take
[1:40:39] Martin Luther you know new languages he
[1:40:42] was a genius amen very very smart man
[1:40:46] and all the reformers were very smart
[1:40:49] men they knew multiple languages they
[1:40:50] translate the Bible did did incredible
[1:40:53] things but then the Pentecostal move was
[1:40:56] the last part of that man anointing the
[1:40:59] restoration of the gifts but then
[1:41:01] brother B says now when the seals are
[1:41:03] open then the eagle begins to fly that
[1:41:06] anointing and then also I'm just going
[1:41:09] to tie a few things together but then
[1:41:11] then also he's told in the early 60s
[1:41:14] store up the
[1:41:15] food who's ever heard of him he had a
[1:41:17] vision of bringing lots of food fresh
[1:41:19] veggies and things and storing it into
[1:41:21] the Tabernacle so there was a call God
[1:41:24] was telling him store up the food
[1:41:26] because there's going to be a famine
[1:41:28] thank you Lord amen so he says now we
[1:41:30] know so so be so I begin to store
[1:41:33] up see if I can find
[1:41:39] it doesn't taking sides with Jesus but
[1:41:42] then he does he does mention it earlier
[1:41:44] as well
[1:41:46] he he says I'll take a week no wait okay
[1:41:50] he is a around here anywhere that will
[1:41:53] compare with the message we have now of
[1:41:54] course our little brothers here that's
[1:41:56] out along here these other little
[1:41:58] churches are us we're ones who's saying
[1:42:00] the message that we have where would you
[1:42:03] go to to find it show its comparison
[1:42:05] anywhere you go right out in
[1:42:08] denominational Creeds you'll go right
[1:42:10] out away from the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:13] you'll go right away from these other
[1:42:15] things see and here's where the food's
[1:42:17] been stored up while one message I
[1:42:20] preached here to you all look I've been
[1:42:22] preaching from 1 to 6 hours to you on a
[1:42:25] message well if I had to use one of
[1:42:28] those message I'd take a week to take it
[1:42:31] and just a little bit here and a little
[1:42:33] bit there see because it's been stored
[1:42:35] up
[1:42:36] here it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on
[1:42:40] the tapes where people in their houses
[1:42:42] then tapes will fall right into the
[1:42:45] hands of the predestinated of God he can
[1:42:48] direct his word he'll Direct everything
[1:42:51] just exactly to its course that's the
[1:42:54] reason he sent me back to do the store
[1:42:56] up the food here he said he forbid me to
[1:42:59] go overseas so he had the vision store
[1:43:01] up the food and we got tapes he got
[1:43:04] tapes and tapes of spiritual
[1:43:07] food amen I TR you know I trust this
[1:43:10] mean something to
[1:43:11] you what why is God doing that because
[1:43:14] God knows a famine because remember God
[1:43:16] said I caused the famine Amos say so he
[1:43:18] knew a famine was going to come so he
[1:43:20] had to make a storehouse now as I said
[1:43:23] the famine is not for bread or water or
[1:43:26] I could say even printed the printed
[1:43:28] word but the famine is hearing the word
[1:43:31] of the Lord amen that is the famine in
[1:43:33] the land amen so now God is instructing
[1:43:37] his Prophet now store up the
[1:43:39] food because he knows a famine is
[1:43:42] coming
[1:43:44] Hallelujah so God has provided a
[1:43:47] storehouse remember in a time of famine
[1:43:49] people will eat anything
[1:43:51] they bark off trees they'll even eat
[1:43:53] their pets they'll eat
[1:43:55] anything and so the world if someone's
[1:43:57] hungry enough they'll eat out of a
[1:43:59] garbage can just to try and sustain
[1:44:02] themselves and people if you look at the
[1:44:04] Modern Church of this
[1:44:06] day I wish I had it on me but there was
[1:44:08] one big mega church in in America and
[1:44:11] they and they put out a poll asking the
[1:44:13] people you know how it was and they said
[1:44:16] the older ones they felt they are not
[1:44:19] getting fed enough the older people in
[1:44:21] the
[1:44:22] church why because the meal is is it's
[1:44:25] not enough to actually grow
[1:44:28] someone
[1:44:30] amen so now he knows so God tells him to
[1:44:34] do
[1:44:35] this and then at the end of his ministry
[1:44:39] this is in
[1:44:43] 1965 yeah spiritual food and due season
[1:44:45] he preach sermon spiritual food and due
[1:44:48] season and then he goes he goes to the
[1:44:51] text in first uh First Kings 17 and you
[1:44:55] know you you how Elijah he goes to King
[1:44:58] Ahab it says rain or Jew will not fall
[1:45:00] until I call for it and then God says
[1:45:03] leave there and go to the brook cherith
[1:45:06] and I'll send Ravens to feed you yeah
[1:45:09] and then after that he goes to the widow
[1:45:10] woman's house so God God tells us
[1:45:14] Prophet now leave Israel and that's one
[1:45:17] sign a placees under judgment when a
[1:45:20] prophet
[1:45:21] leaves amen and so he says leave there I
[1:45:25] have a chosen place to feed you in time
[1:45:27] of a
[1:45:28] famine yeah so now the prophet was Fe
[1:45:32] was actually he was living just fine by
[1:45:35] that Brook cuz God had provided it for
[1:45:38] him so that he wouldn't perish with the
[1:45:40] rest of Israel during the famine so
[1:45:43] after the message came now then the
[1:45:45] prophets called go here and it's the
[1:45:47] same thing now we have a storehouse amen
[1:45:51] amen we have a brook Cher amen amen we
[1:45:54] have we have food that is prepared for
[1:45:57] us in this time of famine amen amen that
[1:46:00] you have been granted you have been
[1:46:02] allowed to come to his banqueting house
[1:46:05] that has been prepared for you amen amen
[1:46:08] does this mean I trust it means
[1:46:09] something to you
[1:46:13] Hallelujah and then so
[1:46:16] now I'm just going
[1:46:19] to
[1:46:21] so if we have this
[1:46:26] now he says in spiritual food a due
[1:46:28] season remember that's why that's why if
[1:46:31] you look at the world I'm not being
[1:46:33] judgmental but you just got to look at
[1:46:34] it why is why is Christianity
[1:46:38] Fallen you know why is it Fallen to
[1:46:41] where it's become
[1:46:43] accepted in many
[1:46:45] cases amen why is that it's because what
[1:46:49] they're feeding on remember because if
[1:46:50] you can't feed on if you don't have a
[1:46:53] real source of food you go to a garbage
[1:46:55] Camp amen and that's why remember it's
[1:46:58] meant to be the word that keeps the
[1:47:00] people amen it should be the attraction
[1:47:03] of the word should keep a people coming
[1:47:05] to church not not anything else but it
[1:47:07] should be the word that's preached and
[1:47:10] because people do not have the word
[1:47:11] anymore they have to substitute it for
[1:47:13] educational programs youth programs
[1:47:16] music becomes the main thing you know
[1:47:18] because there's no word there to keep
[1:47:20] them people they have to substitute it
[1:47:22] so instead of something that can feed
[1:47:24] the soul of a hungry person they have to
[1:47:26] substitute it for something else and
[1:47:29] that's what you see
[1:47:31] unfortunately why it's because we're
[1:47:33] living in a time of
[1:47:34] famine amen and it's because
[1:47:38] now the way to the tree of life is
[1:47:42] protected okay now remember it said the
[1:47:45] voice of the fourth Beast said come and
[1:47:47] see now when but it doesn't say that
[1:47:52] with any of the other cherubs cherubim
[1:47:54] faces it's the fourth one says when it
[1:47:57] heard the voice and so now God put a man
[1:48:01] upon the earth now this is very
[1:48:03] important because it's not him thinking
[1:48:05] this is what I think of the scripture
[1:48:08] amen but God put a prophet messenger
[1:48:10] upon the Earth because remember Jesus
[1:48:13] said the words I speak to they are
[1:48:14] spirit and they are life amen man shall
[1:48:18] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:48:20] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:48:21] God Amen how does God speak through
[1:48:24] prophets amen Amos 3:7 I'll do nothing
[1:48:27] till I reveal to our servants the
[1:48:28] prophets so when a prophet speaks and
[1:48:30] he's a Vindicated Prophet scripturally
[1:48:33] Vindicated Prophet then that is the
[1:48:35] voice of God speaking amen amen that is
[1:48:38] God speaking so that is I can say the
[1:48:41] voice of my
[1:48:43] beloved amen if you hear that voice but
[1:48:46] you hear not just not brother brandham
[1:48:49] but you hear that voice by behind the
[1:48:50] voice amen Jesus many people heard
[1:48:53] Jesus's voice but the disciples and like
[1:48:56] the woman at the well they heard a voice
[1:48:57] behind the voice then you then you this
[1:49:00] is more than a man speaking Peter said
[1:49:02] to him to whom shall I to whom shall we
[1:49:04] go you have the words of eternal life
[1:49:07] amen amen they knew it was there was a
[1:49:09] voice speaking behind that voice that
[1:49:12] was God Amen and so it's the same thing
[1:49:15] now remember the
[1:49:18] way maybe I better of backtrack
[1:49:20] no I'll say this every age has an access
[1:49:26] to the tree of life every ages had an
[1:49:29] access yeah in previous ages
[1:49:32] denomination people could really be
[1:49:33] sealed into the kingdom amen but we're
[1:49:37] living in a different time we're living
[1:49:39] in a much different time wherever you
[1:49:42] because remember Jesus has to be on the
[1:49:45] outside of his church knocking yeah oh
[1:49:48] when's that going to happen it's already
[1:49:49] happened
[1:49:51] we have to realize we have been Bor into
[1:49:54] if you're young even you know we have
[1:49:57] been born into to an age where the
[1:50:00] judgments of God are already being
[1:50:01] poured out it's not the world is getting
[1:50:04] worse you know like it was fine now it's
[1:50:07] got bad but now it's just all bad amen
[1:50:11] we're not living in a time where it was
[1:50:12] good and then you can look back and say
[1:50:14] well everything you know hospitals never
[1:50:16] used to have big waiting lists like they
[1:50:18] have now things used to work a lot
[1:50:21] what's happened now everything's falling
[1:50:23] apart why it's because the judgments of
[1:50:25] God are being poured out but we just
[1:50:27] happen to be born into this time where
[1:50:29] it's pre-tribulation
[1:50:31] time I trust that's not a shock to you
[1:50:34] we're living in pre-tribulation time
[1:50:36] what is pre-tribulation time the
[1:50:37] tribulation starts to build things start
[1:50:40] to get worse and worse and
[1:50:42] worse
[1:50:44] amen and then the reason that is is
[1:50:48] because now as I said Jesus is on the
[1:50:50] outside of his church knocking so there
[1:50:53] has to be a time where he reveals
[1:50:55] himself and and they turn him down and
[1:50:57] and that's happened through the ministry
[1:50:59] of the Prophet amen that scripture was
[1:51:01] lived out in his life CU they weren't
[1:51:04] rejecting him they
[1:51:05] rejecting God just like when Israel
[1:51:08] wanted a king God said to Samuel they're
[1:51:11] not rejecting you they're rejecting
[1:51:13] me amen and so it's the same thing the
[1:51:16] churches didn't want the word to rule
[1:51:18] over them so they kicked him
[1:51:21] out yeah so he's on the outside so now
[1:51:25] the churches now canot bring someone to
[1:51:27] a complete birth y That's Right amen you
[1:51:31] need the access to the Tree of Life to
[1:51:35] actually be fully born
[1:51:37] again now this is not this is not being
[1:51:40] exclusive remember Jesus you know the
[1:51:42] lamb that was given before Jesus died on
[1:51:45] the cross that worked to cover sin up
[1:51:49] but then as soon as Jesus died that same
[1:51:51] lamb didn't work anymore God had changed
[1:51:54] his access to eternal
[1:51:56] life yeah and then so now that's why you
[1:52:00] see and I trust I trust you can see I
[1:52:02] trust you can see a difference you have
[1:52:05] who have been a nominal churches you can
[1:52:07] see a difference in your own life from
[1:52:09] being there to coming into here from
[1:52:12] actually receiving the message remember
[1:52:14] the message is Jesus Christ amen it's
[1:52:17] not a tack on to the Bible it's not some
[1:52:19] add-on it is he it is this being
[1:52:21] revealed amen amen so
[1:52:25] now there is no access there anymore to
[1:52:29] actually partake of the tree of life
[1:52:31] people can be justified they can even be
[1:52:33] Sanctified but to be fully birth into
[1:52:36] the kingdom is a totally different thing
[1:52:39] yeah so here was a man now I'm not
[1:52:41] saying he's the Cher but I I I trust
[1:52:43] this this this comes out right but
[1:52:46] anyone who rejects if you rejected John
[1:52:49] the Baptist you you reject his
[1:52:51] message yeah if you reject Moses you
[1:52:53] would have rejected Moses's message no
[1:52:56] one who rejected you know who would have
[1:52:59] got on the ark if they would have
[1:53:01] rejected
[1:53:02] Noah no one did they had to accept Noah
[1:53:05] to accept his message so they had to
[1:53:08] accept the vessel God was using in order
[1:53:10] to receive what God was trying to give
[1:53:13] yeah because the A and it's like the
[1:53:16] voice of the fourth Beast said come and
[1:53:17] see so now God would use a man to
[1:53:22] actually give access to
[1:53:24] to to the Tree of Life to Jesus Christ
[1:53:28] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:53:30] hearing the word of
[1:53:31] God Amen I trust it doesn't sound scary
[1:53:34] to you I trust you understand amen that
[1:53:39] so everyone who who's actually turned
[1:53:41] down the
[1:53:43] messenger do not receive what the access
[1:53:46] to the tree of life like they should
[1:53:49] have oh but I've been anointed I've done
[1:53:51] all kinds of things to be anointed and
[1:53:53] to be sealed in are two different
[1:53:55] things
[1:53:57] amen because it's like the you know it's
[1:54:00] like the parable I think we talking
[1:54:01] about this morning parable of Jesus said
[1:54:04] the kingdom of God is like a fisherman
[1:54:05] throwing a net out into the water pulls
[1:54:07] a net in what's that that's the that's
[1:54:10] the word going out all those fish come
[1:54:13] under the influence all the creatures in
[1:54:15] the net and and and I'll close with this
[1:54:18] all the creatures in the net come under
[1:54:19] the influence of the net so the fish the
[1:54:22] water spider the snake the eel whatever
[1:54:25] they all come under so you can say they
[1:54:27] all get
[1:54:28] anointed and now they're being pulled
[1:54:31] into the
[1:54:32] boat
[1:54:34] but not all of those creatures in the
[1:54:37] net are the
[1:54:38] fish amen then what happens the fish
[1:54:42] that are that that that the fisherman
[1:54:44] wants they go into the chili whatever
[1:54:47] you call it amen the others are just
[1:54:49] thrown
[1:54:51] oversight yeah so they all come under
[1:54:53] because in order to be convicted there
[1:54:55] has to be something prick your heart
[1:54:58] amen so there's an anointing goes out
[1:55:00] and that can actually con convict
[1:55:02] someone amen they can come under the
[1:55:04] influence of the word but then it
[1:55:07] actually takes now God actually actually
[1:55:10] they have to be willing to fully
[1:55:12] surrender to
[1:55:13] it amen and then God could they're fish
[1:55:18] they always were fish remember you
[1:55:19] always were seed you didn't become a son
[1:55:22] you always were a son amen oh I'm you
[1:55:26] know you may be battling through the
[1:55:27] greatest battle you've ever gone through
[1:55:29] but I trust there's something in you
[1:55:31] says that I'm a son or I'm a daughter
[1:55:33] amen amen you don't throw your kids away
[1:55:36] because you have a bad day with them I
[1:55:38] trust you don't anyway amen even if you
[1:55:41] probably maybe feel like it but deep
[1:55:43] down you know that they're
[1:55:45] yours amen multiply that by 10 billion
[1:55:49] billion billion ions and that's how God
[1:55:50] feels about
[1:55:52] you
[1:55:54] amen but we've been granted
[1:55:58] access I don't want to be too long today
[1:56:01] but we've been granted access to
[1:56:04] actually partake you think what you have
[1:56:07] I I I trust God just takes all this and
[1:56:10] puts it out how it should have gone
[1:56:11] thank you Lord but you have been given
[1:56:13] access and many people look at the same
[1:56:15] thing you look at and say it's ult it's
[1:56:18] fanaticism it's garbage yeah why he's so
[1:56:21] judgmentally he's mean look at what he
[1:56:23] does Amen but to the
[1:56:27] predestinated you know John you know
[1:56:29] John the Baptist ministry people would
[1:56:31] have said the same thing about him look
[1:56:33] he went up there before Herod and you
[1:56:35] know said you know it's not lawful for
[1:56:37] you to have your brother's wife and all
[1:56:38] these things so judgmental didn't even
[1:56:41] dress right didn't even have a church to
[1:56:43] preach him called them a bunch of Snakes
[1:56:44] in the Grass they so
[1:56:46] mean why is that he's so so mean
[1:56:50] but them it says in the scripture them
[1:56:52] that Reed John receed Jesus am we have
[1:56:56] some
[1:56:57] musicians amen but then so when you look
[1:57:00] at the word I trust when you look at the
[1:57:01] message when you hear it it's
[1:57:04] more it's more than words it's more than
[1:57:08] Supernatural
[1:57:09] Ministry amen but it's actually that's
[1:57:13] that's God speaking to you amen yeah and
[1:57:18] what and and if you can recognize that
[1:57:22] and not only just recognize it but then
[1:57:24] yield yourself can be hard to die
[1:57:27] nothing wants to die but when you
[1:57:29] finally do when you finally drop the
[1:57:32] mask and be real remember Jesus sees you
[1:57:36] as
[1:57:37] undefiled but you have to be willing to
[1:57:39] yield yourself to him amen just be real
[1:57:45] be real then God can come and take you
[1:57:48] and make you what he wants you to be if
[1:57:51] you're willing to let
[1:57:53] him
[1:57:58] amen we have a feast in this day the
[1:58:01] whole world is starving what does that
[1:58:04] mean we should hog it to ourselves now
[1:58:06] if you try a real good restaurant you go

[1:58:27] candle got
[1:58:28] lit amen tell tell people he's real and
[1:58:32] then they'll listen to you that's what I
