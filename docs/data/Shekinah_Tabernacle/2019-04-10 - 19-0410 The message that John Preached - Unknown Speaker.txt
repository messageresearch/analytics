========================================
[Music] good evening everyone [Music] hey you're doing doing good at a good week yeah it's good out of 10 like 11 [Music] that's right we do a little thing at UM youth group you know we always start and we have to say one thing that we're thankful about just to keep a grateful attitude in our lives there's some quite humorous what their children come up with well the young fellas come up with that they're thankful for a lot of us like the boys are like food and sleep and all these things but we've got so many things to be thankful for in our lives and and you know the Lord's done so much for us without even doing anything more for us and to always have a grateful attitude is I mean they teach you that in a natural aspect of life but really in a spiritual aspect that's such an important attitude that we have to be grateful of everything that we have that's you know we are we we govern things by our last experience and something is because we have to we have to like put things in context do something else to govern if it's good or bad or not you know what I mean like like like we were doing this bit of a walk for a couple of days Dave and I and you'd carry a pack for a day and like man this is heaven in the next day you can go walking with no pick you like the house is so much easier but by the end of that that you're thinking I was is quite hard it's because in relation to the hard thing it was you know it became it was hard but then when you got used to the easier thing then it was now hard you know what I mean but you know I don't know why I said that but it's somehow relates to our Christian walk you know we we've just always got to have the right attitude towards our Christian towards God towards our Christian walk and always have a grateful attitude

amongst us this evening let's just pull upon the gifts in and have our hearts ready to receive and eager to receive from God if we're like that then God will come down when their attitude is like that God will come he always comes Bruce wanted and he likes to be constrained you know when you're Swift the disciples after talking with him on the road to Emmaus when he got to where they were going he said I'm going to carry on I'll carry on they said no no stay for a bit longer no no I think I've got no stay stay no yes no stage we want you to stay we've enjoyed your fellowship so much I want you

the road good amen thank you musicians amen hallelujah well praise God amen I'm gonna preach tonight by the Lord's grace I is leading the message that John preached amen hallelujah I've been wanting to preach this for a long time but never really hit and it's never opened ups but it opened up this time and praise God the message that John preached amen I'll hold back let's just read the scriptures and then we can meet you sit down okay amen so return to John chapter 1 verse 19 you know this is such a lovely place to be this is home this is the eternal family you know hallelujah it's the best place in the hardest place to preach because you know everybody's so close you love everybody you know hallelujah amen John chapter 1 verse 19 through 223 and it says here this is John's message coming to its climax ok so just let's let's just read that and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are you and then who are you they want to know who he is amen and he confessed and denied not but confess I am NOT the Christ and they asked him what then are you Elijah and he said I am NOT he's a great revelation in that you know that there's only one record of Elijah in the Old Testament and they asked if he was them because there's no revelation of to Elijah's in the Old Testament until Jesus brings it out in the New Testament that there's two Elijah's two for under two comings but this Elijah here this is I'm not the one Malakai for and in he knows that he's malachi free and he knows he's in the spirit and power of elijah but the Pharisees are asking him are you that Elijah said no I'm not that Elijah he didn't say he wasn't the other Elijah just is he wasn't Malachi fought so that shows you that there is actually - it's on the Baptist and brother Branham and he says here are you that prophet and he says no then said they unto Him who are you that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah just jump down to verse 29 he's here and this is the next day John sees Jesus coming now this is the climax of John's message this is it it's the whole thing was for this he prepared there was a preparation of all the things then this this is his message now this is what he came to do the next day John seeth Jesus coming to him and saith behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world you may be seen God bless his word amen this was the epitome of John's message this was the fruit of John's message this was what it was all for was that he would introduce a doctrine now I'm joking not adoption just checking to see if you were listening to introduce a person okay now I didn't introduce a spiritual being yet he was spiritual because the Spirit of God was in him but he introduced a person a person that would vindicate John's message as the ministry was introduced baptized and the people were prepared that were John's disciples John's you see it said that he would prepare the way before me so John had this message and it would prepare all the ground of the people to receive this person so John's message was not just another bunch of teaching now the Pharisees the Sadducees probably thought oh you know and they probably told everybody this guy's gone off the deep in look he's gone and he's teaching this thing and he's saying that his messages is going to introduce the Messiah and yeah and look it's all different from what we've been taught it's all different from what all the denominations are saying it's all different from what the schools of thought it's different from all the critical analysis of the Scriptures that we have analyzed for 4,000 years hmm all the priests in all the Pharisees and all of the learned men critically analyzing they can poke a pin in the scripture and show you what paid tell you what word it's on how much they knew that Old Testament and here's John was a message of men that came out of the wilderness under the spirit and power of Elijah to challenge the harlots of that day to challenge the spirit of Babylon that had creeped into the Church of that day and here he comes and he preaches these things and he what did he do he made all of the lofty places low and he brought all the low places high a man so he might made the humble and brought them up and showed them who they really were the people that walked about and goatskins and lambskins of whom the world was not worthy of got raised up into their position ready to meet the message of john the message of john was not just another teaching as much as it could be reduced to that by the religious people of that day but John's message was an as a person a man a person that actually began to continue and if you keep that message connected to John you have John's message this is John's message I'm going to look at it from that angle okay so that we can see a parallel with the message of our alum the message of today because the message of today is not just another compilation of doctrines and mysteries being revealed no that was just the preparation for something to take place that was the preparation for our Elisha amen for our Elisha to introduce his message his message was also a person John's message needed to pay for the sins of the whole world he couldn't live inside a man at that stage he had to actually pay he best way said behold the lamb of God our Elijah said behold the pillar of fire the glory of God the word of God the word manifested behold the manifested word and its fullness and he was the manifested word and his fullness but he came in a body just little lower than death that he may pay he came as a kinsman because a price had to be paid amen so John's message was a lamb that would pay the price for the whole world that's why he said this is the Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world now when the when John's message continued on and the message unfolded and there was all the people standing around and watching he he was definitely being observed because this was quite an interesting event that took place this was there was things happening that weren't usually happening and I can say that tonight there's things happening that haven't usually been happening amen there was things happening in 433 266 that weren't usually happening because God was doing something Amen there was something different from the norm something different something higher because an event was taking place an event is taking place and the devil will do all he can to minimize that a net Rifai but it's a spiritual event it's an eternal event and like I prayed earlier the fabric between time and eternity is disappearing amen and you're beginning to see things that you never used to be able to see because God is taking all your thinking he's taking our thinking every time you hear sermon every time you say a man you're thinking is coming up every time that you rejoice on something that God speaks to you every time the word comes across your path and something as quickened your thoughts coming up higher eventually your thoughts are going to end up like God's thoughts hallelujah and I believe we're right on that road I believe that scripture is being fulfilled Amen that we shall see him as he is hallelujah we're in the middle of the greatest event that Calvary purchased amen everything that Calvary purchased as now coming into its full effect how God wanted those floodgates to open how long how what the Lord was so desirous to see as the the revelation of himself come out but it was steered and trapped in by the decrees and dogmas of men and in Catholicism and denominationalism and all of those isms and man's ideas I'll get into that later but you see now there's all these people around and John have a drink these people watching these different seeds they're want to talk about the seed for a little bit because you know it's quite important the seed of God there's a seed inside a predestined heart God knew it before the foundation of the world you you were written on that book before the world was even formed amen you're engraved in the palms of his hands hallelujah the joy that you're feeling now he was caring he was envisaged it was before him as he carried that cross he loves it when you rejoice that's what he did it for he wanted that fellowship he wanted that rejoicing bride before him hallelujah so there's all these seeds their seeds people other seeds know these seeds of there's two different seeds amen we'll just just go right out and say there's two different seeds okay two seats is the seed of God and the seed of the devil children of God and children of the devil right now all these bodies are the same your body's just as mixed as everybody else's body I'm not talking about the flesh I'm talking about the heart talking about what happens when the word comes across amen you're not heavens when the word comes across you a your gonna manifest something hallelujah you're gonna manifest your origin what you really are is gonna come forth amen okay so here John's message but stop when John went into the prison hallelujah no no it didn't stop there it continued on John's message just continued on amen amen so John's message now he comes up and now he's in having these prayer lines and preemies everyone's enjoying and you know and then he starts to and then you know Philip he gets blown away by what's going on because you see there's something happening and the word went forth the sign of the Messiah amen they were taught back in those days that the real not the religious Babylonian teaching but the real teaching of the fathers to the sons and the mothers and those real Jewish people that didn't buy into the Babylonian things and they taught their children when the Messiah comes he will do what Moses did you'll know the very secrets of the heart people just say in your heart hallelujah but it's going to go beyond that because of the light that we known that even you'll be a pre distance see a pre distance seed inside some people that's good because God wrote their name on the book before the world even began amen actually I'm going to go a little deeper those people rejected the devil's lie in eternity do you know that they rejected the devil's lie amen when he tried to deceive all the angels way back there hallelujah and they rejoiced amen they shouted they shouted for joy back there you know you're getting realigned to that image a man I can see it happening there's an eruption taking place we're coming back to that shouting image of jory Amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen why not fast track it hallelujah a man you just rejoice hallelujah so these seeds that are there and here here comes Philippa knees rejoicing and Jesus you know the message of John he's still going you know but he was in a body this time he's in a body the first coming because he had to die remember ok so just keep that perspective ear and whatever so that he's in the body and now his message is still going right Alleluia let me just put this here just to put her into a bit of context if the atonement had been made already the John's message would have been inside him John's message would have been in him and speaking through his lips but the atonement would have been made and the Holy Ghost could have come into John and the same Messiah the same Jesus the same person would have anointed the Prophet gift and spoke through John and done all the same things just think of that put Jesus inside John but the atonement hadn't been made he couldn't come into the man like that here to do it but he couldn't the second come he couldn't brother brainers ministry the larger of the end time could do it that's why I did it but it's the same principle the same Messiah had to be reintroduced to the people I'm gonna hit that that's gonna be one of the major points just as soon just soon let me get to the seed thing because it's just so good they flip so happy I mean he must have been rejoicing like well because something happened it went beyond the intellectual at wit beyond that it actually went to the eternal realm that eternal part of him was so stirred because the word came across his path the word the sign of the Messiah actually was spoken over him and Jesus he knew he had need to go by Philip he had need to go by Peter and he was using Philip to go to Nathaniel now so Philip dropped his water pot full of drop whatever he is doing because something crossed his path something came across him something touch that seed with him and then an unstoppable glorious resurrection power came forth amen hallelujah that couldn't stop he didn't he everything just changed right there did he that was before even got the Holy Ghost because it wasn't even poured out at that stage but there was enough quickening power in that seed hallelujah but when the word came past in the word crossed that path light and rain came in hallelujah inside that seed is divine intelligence inside the seat of God with the new His divine intelligence it's not your intelligence it's not your ability it's not what you can do it's in the scene already hallelujah amen and sow the seed cross Philips past he got so excited he dropped his water pot like the woman at the well he did the same thing a man he got all excited he just went running he's gotta go find his friends it's got to go dancing Nathaniel this is Nathaniel come and see I found the Messiah Nathaniel was like oh yeah okay here we go this is another food asur another one of these other guys but no this was different you could see a different look and Philips eyes so he says okay because he said come and see and so he comes and season and now that predestined seed is already starting to this light already happening amen this radiation going down into that sea penetrating the soil of the flesh hallelujah and so you know that lights coming down in there and Nathaniel's already is coming there and all of a sudden he crosses over from his prayer line and he looks over and he looks in this annual right in the eyes and he says behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile hallelujah light struck the seed hallelujah reality struck and he says he didn't say he didn't say Beelzebub he didn't say you're a devil he didn't say it wasn't right they didn't say this is different doctrine he didn't say this is what the Pharisee said he said behold the Son of God the king of Israel cuz the seed brought forth its origin the reality of who he really was down deep that reality came forth right there because the word struck the seed now that's what needs to happen for all of us and I'm just praying and this has been my prayer let it happen Lord let it happen let that light strike the seed I'm gonna read sign of the Messiah out of the countdown later on I'm gonna pray that the Lord will make it so real when I read that but if there's anybody in here that hasn't had that that experience that experience where they've been quickened and that sick and pull sign that sign of the Messiah that resurrection sign I pray that it would just that like would gleam over your heart tonight and if anybody's listening on that tape it will gleam over but you know and I've been praying what stops it cuz we hear these meant prayer lines and we hear them maybe we just get glossed over maybe we get like John stuck up in a prison in your eye gets filmed over or something and then something kind of can happen like that get too busy get too caught up that you're not you're not she and one accord with the fort that's being ministered you're not getting in the spirit of the messages that are actually sounding on those tapes because that's so important we're not just listening to a tape just to do our religious duty to learn something new but is us there's a reality there and when your thoughts can be caught up quick getting into the same accord as the thought of God when it was ministered the very the very substance I believe that you'll have an athenian experience this is blessed are you Nathaniel hallelujah amen he said that because I did that because I showed you the sign of the Messiah you believed you shall see greater things you shall see heaven opened hallelujah who wants to see him an openly men hallelujah Amen heaven open you shall see it and maybe someone in here or as listening hasn't seen that and it's still just a bunch of compilations of thoughts and ideas and difference from your denominational but there is a God in this place the world is kitted in this place if you just just just just just just just lay everything else aside and pay all your attention and all your worship and all your thinking and all your mental everything remember Mary's the the very confession of Mary the very word that that angel said you shall conceive of the Holy Ghost it started here there was a conception take place she had to agree then it went down so there was a conception right here because that's where the Beryl Graham begins right here so it started there with the word he'd laid a seed and the seed was life came down so you know there's a you just get into the spirit of this meeting get into the spirit of the message get into the Spirit of God and prayer when you're listening to tapes when your Bible study when your fellowshipping hallelujah don't waste time amen so let's see it and he said he just says you know you shall see heaven open and I'm just asking any of you here you want to see him and open I mean I see heaven open I see it open I see it open every Sunday I see it open every Wednesday I see it open all the other times in my prayer closet wherever I'm walking with God I see heaven open and it's glorious tell you it's more glorious than you could ever imagine if you haven't if you know when that when that discernment no that's not just a gift of prophecy it's not just another people it's not just psychology it's not just reading the mind there's a deeper spiritual reality behind it there's a purpose of God in doing it and that is a sign of the Messiah that you can recognize John's message you can recognize the person that is vindicating John's message and you will stop looking at a man louia the scoffers of this message look at brother ben and more than we do that's what they do they focus on the man and they never saw past them because they're blind because of pride arrogance scoffing whatever it may be you know I want to get a bit of a ending here later why it's a place that we all need to get to oh yeah we have been or we will be whatever you are you know where you're at and maybe you don't I pray God reveals it to you you know that's one of my prayers and it was for many years like Oh just show me where I stand with you make it real make it plain where do I stand with you Lord make your light shine in my life I want to know I'm walking with you Lord want to know where I stand in in their heavens where I stand because you well sit your mate a certain hey man so here you'll see this you're seated in heavenly places then you're standing on the earth Amen so that I don't know you're doing two things at once amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so you see that seed and Nathanael hallelujah you want to see heaven open I want to see heaven open I see it open and I'm seeing the fabric of time and eternity right now and this time as blending together you know that the Pharisees saw the same thing their reaction was very different you're like you know you can only manifest what's inside you and when the light comes your way you're going to manifest your reality I'm gonna manifest who you really are that's what the word does the light makes manifest hallelujah and so the Pharisee called him a devil the Pharisee called him a liar the Pharisee said he was just making things up lying about his stories and lying about this and lying about that that's what the Pharisee was saying because the word came across him and it made a manifest what he really was and the word discerned him and called him a snake caught him a viper told him who his daddy was yeah but only the word can do that amen Alleluia amen I want to just go into this I want to read this now I'm gonna read this and it's just really I don't know like let's become more than just a quote reading right now but I pray that it would be like it's happening and that seed in your life is going I'm receiving that sign this is a sign what I'm reading here is not just to make you know like I get excited when I listen to the things to the discernment lines never was it wrong never was it wrong perfectly accurate just I'm jumping from John to brother branham here because I just really want

revelation that was of the moon representing that is that right that right that's right raise up your hand he discerned that she was actually amazed that just recent I think it was just before that

the message he'll vindicate Elijah he'll say he will vindicate around what Elijah was saying and this is what he's doing but he wouldn't need to be a body to pay for sin anymore because sin was paid for now he was coming to claim what he paid for hallelujah that said that heaven would release Jesus Christ after he'd been preached so long all these years of just preaching preaching preaching and there's nothing wrong with that that was part of God's plan but then one day instead of preaching it would become a person hallelujah it would become the reality again Jesus Christ would be released from heaven hallelujah that is what the message that we believe yes as a person here he is speaking he's saying this is me do you see it is it quickening something in you this is our God great and mighty to be praised revealing himself manifesting his word and its full power to show you what you really reflect amen you know the whole leading up to that time when the seals all came open was just preparation for you to meet the captain in the land just like the time of Moses the time of Israel when they came out of Egypt you know all of the books of Moses that all the deuteronomy's everything God laid out all of us what he wanted he laid out all of the ways that you can approach God and laid out all of the background and everything so that they knew what God was like and you know the Lord did the same thing for us he raised up a prophet and he preached the message and he he he said this is God likes this and he loves that do you know what it was he was closing you he was giving you perfume for the King because he knew what perfume the King liked he knew the what the scent of your prayer that the King liked he knew the smell of your life would be a sweet how to make it a sweet savour for the King and I know of a story and a man named he guy that did the same thing and Aloha and there was a year of purification it was a process it was a time where Esther was prepared because you know before she just didn't have any idea and all those other ones all those other virgins that claim the same King to be their King and they wanted to marry him as well they did their own imagination they went their own route they took the Kings word the King's doctrines the Kings perfumes and they did it according to the way they fought and it happens today people are taking the same Bible that we take they're taking the same perfume the same prayers the same everything in there trying to clothe themselves they want to be they want to wear their own apparel but they want to be called by his name 7 woman shall take hold of one man but there's one hallelujah 1 Esther that had this connection with a messenger with someone that knew the king that someone they had was partial to Revelation that that perfume the king loved hallelujah preparation for a meeting preparation for a calling preparation for the defining moment of her life Alleluia but she had to be prepared she had to go through purification she had to be closed in the right clothing Alleluia see God does the preparation before there's a meeting before there's that real connection take place before the marriage can take place before the bride can come right into it for position there's a full preparation and I'm looking at those that have been clothed in the perfume that have been clothed than the right perfume more clothes than the right there all of the right ways you walk the right way talking the right way because not because you'd made it up in your own theology or mix this baptist thing here in this denominational thing here and this battle only thing here took this part of the word and that part because you like that that's fashionable that's not no no you had a spiritual connection hallelujah because the sign came your way hallelujah amen a sign was displayed the sign of the Messiah and I'm reading that sign and if they see anybody that doesn't realize that this message is a person listen close right now real close because this Messiah being revealed if John's message was a person then brother branham's message for running the Second Coming is a person - hallelujah hallelujah okay mister you're sitting next to her do you believe that that God can heal you also I make you well will you accept it how many the rest of you will believe with all your heart sure you will congregation says Amen stomach trouble heart trouble God heals at all makes it well that's right the man sitting next to her he's got back trouble you know I got back trouble raise up and be healed in the name of Jesus Christ the same God is here I pray that it that it's like he's happening now hallelujah hallelujah the lady sitting Nick so that has colon trouble that's right do you believe God will heal your colon trouble lady you do coz he will he's the same today amen here on down the line look there's a brain injury sitting there do you believe God heals brain injury nothing's too hard for the Lord remember that it's not this an inverse and it's all the same it's all just sickness and the devil's defeated hallelujah a man has bets broken he's just a liar amen hallelujah this is our God amen he doesn't change his mind he's the same hallelujah amen once sitting next years I trouble the ones that in this year's epileptic fits do you believe God heals our trouble sir do you believe God heals epilepsy the one sitting next to that that little boy also has epilepsy do you believe God heals epilepsy he has loved one sitting there with them has trouble with her head do you believe that God will heal your head trouble lady alright you can have it amen what is it the Word of God for this day is sharper than a two-edged sword Jesus Christ in astronaut power hallelujah amen where astronauts amen amen we bypassed the moon so fast we didn't see it hallelujah amen hallelujah yes sir hallelujah you know science and it's advanced and all of their technological discoveries all it's doing is showing you what God has already given you amen because we know a prophet came and this message actually countdown he actually paralleled the two so if you ever read on the news that man finally discovers a telescope that he can see himself but you can say I already see myself hallelujah God already gave me a seven seal telescope and let me see everything hallelujah I can see past myself into eternity and I was shouting hallelujah amen if this any pews in heaven they're going to be cold because everyone's got to be shouting hallelujah amen the sharing time a man this you really are hallelujah none of this culture amen all the culture of this earth you know it's just it's just formed it's formed from this and there and there but God has descended down with a heavenly culture hallelujah to change our paradigm of thought all apples you know you know and really you know this has been in the last year the Lord has really quickened to me a lot of things actually and I believe to you all we're all in the we're just having a Jubilee you know and amazing Jubilee riding the wave of God's glory hallelujah and you know the thoughts of God when you really you know you're sitting there and you're listening to preaching or you're listening to the word and you or you're singing a song in the thought you you don't just well I let's just become so real even the most basic victories that Jesus did for me and it just becomes so and I just can't contain myself and you know this is the win win this flesh is dissolved and we're a narrow glorified body there's gonna be no inhibitions no old cultural things that make you think who you are and what you're like you'll not really like this the soul inside you shouted for joy and the mind of God the soul inside you rejoiced amen no restrictions you didn't you lived before an audience of one hey man hey man lord help me lives before an audience of one amen hallelujah like that man that was in there playing the violin you know and as master was up there and he played the masterpiece and it was amazing and everybody was cheering standing ovations and and he didn't even take any attention didn't mean anything until he saw the master and if the master stood up and gave him the nod or whatever he gave him now he could relax now he could say yes and that is exactly what it's like for us hallelujah amen praise His Holy Name now I pray I really pray but let's touch somebody amen reading that because you know the Lord he does these things I didn't come up with I was just I don't even know where I was I was just sitting there and then goes just right read that out because I was going to head it down the back of the zoom and I might read a quote at the end at this time I was gonna read that quote and then it was just like no the fort came I read it right at the beginning and if I can say this it's like and I'm gonna make it real as if it because it is real you know it is real this is how he gave it to us he gave it to us on tapes if he gave it to us on tapes he could make it as real as if you were there and if and I believe there's a real seed inside you that just you know likeness then you like the woman at the well like Hedy right when the truth came across she said that's the truth something quickened inside something happened hallelujah the divine intelligence started to stir up a man you know when that intelligence stirs up when you have a revelation like Peter had a revelation you see Jesus is who's who who does everybody say I am you know and Peter sit they all said all this thing but you know but he says who do you say that I am Peter revealed the revelation that he got he revealed when when the word crossed his path there was a seed inside the communicate with his representation in heaven you know representation and heaven you go if you got representation in heaven you're gonna be there I believe I'm looking at people with representation in heaven I'm looking at citizens of the kingdom and in that citizenship is according to the seed within you because when you heard those things it caused you to rise up and you know there is a power inside that quickening seed there's nothing that man can do to stop it there's no religion there's no religious power that can try and stem it down with some concrete of man's ideas there's no Roman seal that can seal over that and the tomb of this flesh there is nothing there's no political power there's no cultural power there's nothing that can stop this when that life starts to cuff off hallelujah amen I mean we can parallel everything in the scripture if we want but I want in there I'm starting to see everything all happen at once mate the Lord is so good amen you know when I just have to say it I amen I just have to say this but the tomb you see life the Pharisees the religious people she say organized religion and satanic any church that has a human government a human government now human hierarchy any church as as followed by as following Satan it's satanic and its nature because it's not the Holy Ghost spirit leader but when the headship comes upon the body of a woman that's been purified by a messenger Alleluia that's the government that we have who's laid their veil on his shoulders hello yeah who put the veil on her me a man who serene did all their rights to him hello yeah these sisters they don't go I'm not gonna cut my hair because this is and listen to the fashion of these ones in their governed by a government of men be governed by the hitch of himself be governed by the king because then he's the one that carries the mind and the heavenly culture that makes us do these things by love Alleluia and so when that seed is quicken there's nothing that can stop me I'm gonna drink all the water and Stokes belly okay all this win that seed you know this life when that life is coming forth it's like another dimension is moving inside you you know it's not just you know are they growing you know it's school and and that when you learn and you go and do your degree and do those you're learning and there but this is different this is actually another dimension happening inside you hello your brother Brown and see this like a little white button when you get the Holy Ghost when you get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost comes in like a little white button you see it comes now it begins the work Oh pushing out all the darkness because a lot of darkness to push out you know louia when this rail came into the land there's a lot of darkness to push out and it took them a long time so don't think it's just going to happen overnight when you get the Holy Ghost it begins the the warfare begins the battle Alleluia and he says it push us out and you just drink more than you need a man you just keep drinking on the word rejoicing in the word getting caught up into the very thoughts you know and all of that political cultural religious all those jackets all of the rock and stone like the Romans and the Pharisees and all those organized religions they came to Pilate they they they they united was Rome and the Union was Rome they used everything that Pilate said make that to mature as you can all the power of Rome now and that all the power of organized religion comes together to try and seal that life in there there's a seed he said the father has given the son to have life in himself what does that mean he's a seed the corn kernel Olivia that kernel of corn Christ stuck in a tomb stuck under stone but there's a prophecy over his life is that cannot stay in there hallelujah and when the light came when there's an angel now comes down and and shakes the earth the earth was shaking amen shaking away all of the fear shaking away all of the inhibitions shaking away the unbelief because there's a seed inside this tomb the scene in it and you know Rome tries to seal people down or tries to hold people on the ground and tries to make people so but but you see there's an angel that's come with a message hallelujah there's an angel that's come hallelujah isn't arrested shaking aim in this lightnings of thunders hallelujah the Thunder that can shake the devil shake this flesh shake it all shake of all things start shakes off because there's a power inside because there's a people that heard the sign and that seed started pushing for hallelujah and it broke the Roman seal because light shone through the flesh like Sean into this earth light shown in this tomb because his life inside that seed and it breaks the Roman seal hallelujah because he's you see him he's looking at you he knocked on the door sorry he knocked on the door you opened hallelujah who opened the door hello yeah Oh with all my heart I open the door Lord do whatever you want hallelujah I see these things hallelujah amen how are we doing okay ten minutes right well I might just leave my notes alone don't ever get to them anyway I got to read this let me read this I have to get to this because this is like the this is where we're going amen you know there was 18 consecutive manifestations of a gift of the sign of the Messiah to make that seed come to life you know all those people the that we read in the Gospels they were in they're not around they were there because there's something touched him jesus said blessed are you this is the power that's inside that resurrection power that was released when you received that same gift you saw heaven opened you start seeing the body go to the son of man you see the angels and you see them descending and ascending you see true ministry true fivefold ministry coming through and you capture you realize that they're preaching to you something more than just another theology amen because the seeds quicken to release a power and it's a power that's released that nothing can stop it nothing can stop it hallelujah amen he came out of the tomb amen Jesus sister Peter the gates of Hell will not prevail against it now there is the case of Hell will lose all defenses because you're going fold you're moving forward in the name of the Lord hallelujah advancing on your inheritance soldiers of the Lord walking with the sword wrong taking orders from the hit ship that's resting on you Christ Himself the real headship no human government no organized religion this message is not organized religion anyone that says that this message is a denomination has no idea that there is no hierarchy because that's what makes a denomination of denomination as they form a hierarchy and they form a whole bunch of stagnant doctrines and that's it they take a photo of whatever Brett whatever was happening and that's it doesn't move but our government has a person our government is the message of John amen because you see see behold I seen you Elijah the Prophet he shall turn your heart back to the Epis taluk father's what was the message it was the same message of John they're pointing to him the person the Messiah and he does the sign to quicken hunt so that life comes forth so the resurrection power can come and combat the enemy break down the enemies chains loose the captives the lame shall walk the dead shall be raised and we see it happening hallelujah this is our God we're in the book of X amen have you seen the front-page news hallelujah we're reading the front-page news amen we're not reading a book of history hello yeah man I feel good hallelujah doesn't that make you feel good these are a rejoice rejoice in the Lord pray without ceasing and everything miss hairs Elijah's the Elijah foreigners position and prophecy John 328 it says ye yourselves bear me witness that I said I am NOT the Christ but that I am sent before him he that has the bride as the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfil he must increase it I must decrease so this is exactly what has happened in both the first coming Elijah and the second coming when they win it win-win the the whole purpose of their ministries was to prepare the people and in present the booth of the Messiah amen one was a physical Messiah the next was a spiritual is a spiritual Messiah and he has come in the fullness of his power to bring his bride into the fullness of her inheritance and there is no other government can do it denominational governments can't do it the war is too strong the devil is too smart for our own intelligence that's why the Devils outsmarted the denomination's because they're led by men and he just has some wrapped around his little finger and down in the fashions of Hollywood or down in some legal aswer or some liberal way caught up and they think that they're all right because supernatural things happen but the rains just falling on the unjust you look at their lives they do not get transformed they do not get changed they live just like the world because the overcoming transforming power cannot happen in their hierarchy cannot happen with a hybrid teaching it has to be Christ he must increase in I must decrease and we saw that when the Prophet preached the Seventh Seal he brought these things out he said that I must I'm gonna basically say I'm leaving the scene he's taken over and now Christ is moving in that ministry like never before I mean it was still brother Branham remember don't get me wrong we're not saying that he turned into God himself it was God using the gift using the office amen but it was the season that he could reveal himself in that way just like John know he that cometh from above those above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all and what he has seen and heard that he testifies and no man Eva's destiny you see you realize John by saying my message this person that is going around doing these things and shiny sign and he probably thought as a man everyone's gonna receive this guy you know like this is his life but then when has testimony the proof that we're Testaments the proof and witness proof proof is it in a testament and he starts speaking i my father away if you eat this flesh and drink my blood you should have you have unless you do that you have no life in you they no one received it it was it was so different so alien he they have received those testimony has said to her seal that god is true so this the other side is actually a people that did receive it hallelujah and i know that these are people in this room that did receive it amen hallelujah and you have said to your seal a meant for him whom the lord has sent speak of the words of God for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto Him the Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son has everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him I just want to hold him now on verse 33 John 333 I didn't realize it he that hath received his testimony has set to her seal that God is true and I was really excited about this because I read that word testimony it's the evidence gun oh my he gave evidence Alleluia amen he gave evidence the evidence he gave behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile go get your husband oh yeah we know her real husband was standing in front of her oh and she you know she could have just said he's right here he's right in front of me and I'm sure that something cooking in that upper room amen she stop and think and go read it something happened that was beyond the internet because there was an eternal part inside if the offering was she heard from her theophany right there omnipotent made omnipotent and miraculous place she went running what are you doing are you running a convinced a concerned No are you really convinced have you had that experience and at the moment you're like I remember that those initial moments of my that moment I thought everybody's gonna see this I was like John amazing why is nobody receiving this I thought everybody the whole world's gonna get converted Amen hallelujah because it's so real but not everybody has that part of me I'm not gonna get into predestination but not everybody has that pardoning Alleluia and we read that very clearly no testimony evidence given but there's an set to her seal is sealed with the private seal and Cygnet you see when you when their evidence is given to you and it comes across that seed and you believe it and you receive it you sit to your seal is a signet that takes place to seal your life that God is true that were true as unveiled a god has been unveiled brother was sit to her seal he saw the unveiling of God amen hallelujah all these people I see have said to their seal because they believe basic evidence cross their paths evidence came across him I read some evidence tonight you hear evidence after every sermon hallelujah you see evidence in the scripture you see the book of Acts take place hallelujah and you believe it hallelujah and you see him an open hallelujah any Tennessee coming at you amen hallelujah you sit to your seal a seal takes place on your life amen you put you realize that there was an unmerited grace over your finger hallelujah you hear from your theophany you hear the Eagle scream amen things start opening for you hallelujah and another dimension starts building within you oh my I like that dimension as a dimension you don't have to try and work up you don't have to try and push it and shove it and do things it just happens just seed get caught up in the thought of God discover the secret of real worship amen because we're netsy comes forth all those inhibitions and cultural things and what you think you are you're not all just all a lie all this Babylonian covering this is just a tomb as hold flip it's just a tomb you know one day it was covered in and a Roman seal but the seals open and an angel came down with a message and he said you shall conceive and you said be it unto me according to thy word Amen hallelujah and something started happening inside you and you started walking different talking different because you're pregnant now Amen hallelujah oh my life change a man you had to wait too for things because life was forming in you Amen hallelujah you crave different things hallelujah you stop craving the Hollywood you stop trying to be a showman hallelujah trying to gain the attention for your popularity hallelujah all those things started changing because there was a life and amen and there is a life inside you Amen that life is unstoppable uncontainable unquenchable and all it's doing is getting more and more a monk hallelujah it's growing and growing and growing feed feed feed on the word make those tapes become more to you hallelujah get a conversation going with the Lord and when the devil tries to stop you you just pull out your sword and cut him down because he's defeated he's a liar he tries to rob you of your prayer life he's a liar he's just a lie but he doesn't just lie with information he tries to make you feel like you don't want to pray but it's just a lie and he's lying from the ground cause he can't walk hallelujah so what you can do is just mess on him mess him down hallelujah yes yes you just got to keep doing it let's you stop kicking him down he's gonna start beating you again but remember that revelation gates of hell won't prevail against and sometimes you're going you know sometimes they're you're gonna be on the defense unfortunately that's just what happens you you make a mistake something happens or you get too busy and all of a sudden the devil gives you with that right but when you smack you but the gates of Hell will not prevail against it there's no way you you just cannot be stopped and you get back up and God sends this one and that one and surround you with the body because every joint supplies versus the glory that we have right here every joint supplies the gifts are operating supernatural God is taking place AB God is a supernatural God don't forget that you don't have to conquer things by the tree of knowledge there's nothing wrong sometimes you need to but whatever but you've got the Tree of Life now you have the Tree of Life hallelujah to walk that path to live that path you're gonna have to come out of the rut of the trek of your normal thoughts everything that you were if educated all the ways and paradigms of education and everything like that from the tree of knowledge as a rut that you're so used to he's so comfortable going down that road and then here comes a message I love an open book this is actually the real knowledge this is the real wisdom this wisdom is different from the track that you always went down and the splashes just made that way and you have to start staring out of that track cuz you've got the menu you have dominion and you've got heaven behind you cuz you're an ambassador and God has called you to come out of those ruts God's called you to come out of their way of thinking go against the grain hey man hallelujah you remember that seed inside you that's what's driving it that's the driving hallelujah when you feed it you feed it it'll grow you keep feeding it it's gonna go you're gonna get stronger the Bible says be strengthened in the inner men you gotta feed it and I don't just now this is that that you can read the Bible and not feed the seed you can read the Bible and get nothing you've got to get in the spirit and that sounds maybe it sounds a bit cliche but you actually have to get in the spirit hallelujah it's like I don't know go spend some time and Africa or something I'm joking but those people know how to get in the spirit man they've got the fabric between eternity and time is very different they just seem to this just know they're already in the spirit they're dancing and they're flipping and they're doing all sorts of amazing things and they've got this faith now we can learn something from that we can learn something from that we're just as human we're all the same and it's just cultural differences this just you know history because they've had history of spiritual and whatever and we come from a history you know it's quiet and you know scientific now white people have just gone so far on the tree of knowledge so deep into the sciences and and all of our you know of well I'm speaking for me anyway very scientific very logic based but remember logic is - because down the logic do learn and education is not the logic of heaven actually that's engineered against the logic of heaven these two logics two logics the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life that's it and you boil it all down these two it's the logic of Satan and the logic of heaven and and yes we can we can apply some of those laws and principles and do those things when we are working in this world but really there's a higher logic there's a higher reasoning there's a higher imagination there's a higher cause in effect amen it goes beyond physics goes beyond possibility goes beyond unbelief those ruts of unbelief in those ways that we've always thought there's a seed inside you that's pushing you out of those ruts right now pushing you out but you've just got to fight and if you keep fighting you're gonna keep growing cuz you're gonna start enjoying your prayer life you're gonna start enjoying your Bible studies you're going to be caught up in the thoughts of God hallelujah now how that manifests is different in all people I'm not saying that people that don't do what I do and jump around it's not the same not that's not what I'm saying but these are is a place for the believer a real place it's a good place and it's a place where you're in communion all the time hallelujah I'm gonna read one thing I'm gonna pass a lot here I don't want to bet I will we will amen I'm gonna finish up of this Elijah yeah why did I have to I have to touch this because otherwise it just doesn't put the context and maybe I'll pick it up again another time I probably will actually but why did God have to reintroduce the Messiah when we read in the book of Hebrews that and that sundry times and in divers manners God spake to us through the prophets but now through son and the headship came to the body and in the measure that he came to the first church all but the broke open book had everything the open book seals were not loosed in that day but the book was purchased but there was seven ages the book was opened in that age they would have taken a rapture remember that because they would have eaten the thing that Adam and Eve because what do you realize what you're eating this is not just like I said I keep repeating myself but this is not just another ministry it's not just mysteries you're eating if I can if you just get one thing tonight maybe you're eating the tree of life just you just think about that get caught up in that for practice how to get caught up in the Ford of God and you'll be jumping oh you'll be jumping brother branham had to vent in he would run around the trees and do whatever he said if you saw what I was like you'd think I was going to go and mad because he got caught up in the fall you're eating the tree of life now why did God have to reintroduce Wow so here's Christ leading the church the hip leading the church and we know that the angel of the Lord as he is now right he's doing again but but because of the book of Acts when the book of Acts is in its environment he's an angel but angel of the Lord the same angel that led the children of Israel through to promise man God said my name is enough Paul says I might who I am I actually I'm owned by this angel I serve them because this angel is actually Jesus Christ an angelic form leading his church okay so he's leaving the church and they've got all this so why would at the end time another forerunner have to reintroduce Christ that's already here I tell you he's here 1 John 4:3 and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God you see the entities and this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world so yes it will fully manifest them become a person and later on it would become the beast and all those things right but it was already there the spirit of Antichrist what the spirit of I'm gonna come I'm gonna give you a new word I made this word of Acts I couldn't there's probably a real word for it but I made a word up so this the spirit of Antichrist wants to historicai the Lord [Laughter] there's probably a real word for her like to put something that's meat to be right now and make him historical so so the spirit of Antichrist wants to history and the way you historicai him as by mixing his word mixing it up because his word of spirit in life so the moment you start mixing it mixes word and you have no power and if Satan thinks that's pretty good he'll put her spirit in it that's what he's done with all these funny cults and you know the you know you notice a cult or you notice like a you know a movement of God not God sorry well it may have been but it been it turns what happens is there's a particular thought inside that group and it just seems to propel that group into another big thing and it's arrogant and every time you fellowship they just get straight to them cuz it rolls them because it was a it was a hybrid thought and they mixed something together and Satan was like well I'm gonna use that it's like a tumor and he hops in cider and then he just grows and the people live for that one thing they live for that and seventh-day adventists every time you ever talk to them every book they ever write it always goes straight to that seventh day and it's just such a minor thing and the whole grand scheme of everything but devil got hold of it and this is exactly what happened yes Christ was leading the church yes it was all going good but the season wasn't for them to go in the rapture they came to such a point that if they win any further they would have had the open book the book the seals would have come open and they would have gone on the rapture and we wouldn't even be here maybe we'll just bypass this whole of me because we'd have to be somewhere because we were already in his mind but but we had to be expressed in this earth for a purpose of redemption and to to reciprocate the love of our Savior of our God and His Redemption oh my but yet so the church actually hybridized everything and it became governed by man and organized religion and and it's it and what happened was all the power the altar got broken now the altar was broken and Jezebel I have and all the prophets of bail started rolling the church that's why she's in the book of Revelation that doctrines of Balaam and Jezebel this false prophetess raising up Roman Catholicism and all these things to kill millions and millions of people Satan starting to rule over the people in the name of religion religion Christianity and religion and you know and it grew and grew like a cancer crushed down the word crush down the the seed until it was just a stump that's why God had to reintroduce the reality of himself because he became veiled over with men's traditions man's Jesus is you worship in vain to the people of their Daisy howbeit you worship in vain because you teach for doctrines the commandments of men when you start teaching the commandments of men your worship is vain because it just gets cancerous the Lord when this church form said if you remain humble I will draw my people into my rest in my word shall go forth from this place you know that humility and the true fivefold ministry humble so that it's Christ that can operate the gift not man any when man gets ambitious Satan goes oh I might use this guy you know and it'll this is where historicize the Lord because now something changes and that gift is no longer being operated I love the divine love of God now being operated by fear or operated by ambition and it pulls the people out of the takes Christ out of the prison it takes you know God's moving he moves his church he does this and he moves here and he wants to pour this and he wants to reveal that he's doing this and he'll move he's the hit he's the general his campaign it's his burden he gives little parts of his burden to the ministry that's humble that'll walk with him and move when he moves but then an ambition comes up and then it takes the people into history or that another ambition will take the people into the Millennium already or into some funny thing but a humble gift will keep the people walking with God but Church this is why we read in the book of Kings because remember the Book of Kings and Jesus Bell and a have types the very end time I'm not gonna get him to that we can get brother Adrian to do that he's very good at those things those right into the details of all of the gears Abell religion and prophecy and all that stuff so I'm not gonna help the head at all but I just want to show you the purpose of Elijah you see when Elijah comes he challenges the spirit of the age so here's the church in this morbid condition you know God started moving and working and bringing the people gradually out of Rome but they keep bringing Roman stuff with them and they keep dominating and God wasn't finished you see what I mean he's the church look you don't have to serve the church to be saved I mean he started but but but they brought all the Catholicism all the bevel on with him all the ideas of men still came there one thing so God winked at they're ignorant because he was doing something but he didn't want them to just get a hierarchy as soon as they formed a man's government they died because the Holy Ghost was not fast moves on again and he keeps moving on and moving on and bringing the people further out of Roman Catholicism further out of Babylon but every time they started getting comfortable stopped it put a government over it and set it in stone and God moved on and they died the real Messiah had to be reintroduced without any Roman thoughts without any man's ideas that's why yeah but let's just look at it the condition was the approach to God was broken the you know the real approach to God when we boil it down true baptism baptism and the name of Jesus Christ the revelation of real the real God who Jesus Christ really yes you know those fundamental foundations of faith Satan just took it right out of them they don't have it they just don't have it the altar was broken Jezebel was ruling all all of her daughters all the 450 denomination prophets of bail and the false prophets of the Lord all of them rolling stiffen Elisha amen Elisha snibson God needed someone that could challenge that Jezebel spirit challenged that spirit of the age someone to push in and just only Elijah could do that it's that nature so here comes Elijah I read this in a more finished things eating and Elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar see this is the Ministry of Elijah to repair the altar what's the altar the approach to God to bring the people back into a real relationship with God the altar has to be restored who broke it down the Bale province they just neglected that they were focused on the doctrines of Balaam and all these other things and it sees an Elijah took 12 stones I'm sorry and he repaired the altar which had been of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the son of Jacob now remember we are founded on the doctrine of the apostles and prophets the foundation 12 foundation stones okay so when Elijah comes and turns your heart back to the Apostolic fathers your turn back to the that to that true altar again your turn back to the twelve stones the Epis taluk faith the Apostolic Faith is John's message of going around in circles but it's to show you something that it's a person that we're being that there's an altar that's been restored now this is here and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord hear me O Lord hear me I'm dropping down to verse 37 hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again this is Old Testament now are you seeing the parallel here turn their heart back again this is the the nature of that ministry to challenge the Jezebel spirit to to rip the foundation from under the prophets of bale and all they Babylonians thought all those cultures quicken the seed and turn their hearts back to the true and living God turn their hearts back again now then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice now God has restored melter he's restored an altar in our day all the 12 stones their hearts been turned but there's an sacrifice that needs to fall on that altar you know who that sacrifices you know I know who that is brother bin knows who it is I'm sure you know who it is it's you if you want everything that God has got for you in this message you need to fall on the altar that's been restored you really need to fall on the altar if you want the fire to burn out all of the Babylonian stuff to cleanse you completely back to your origin and empower you for your for your commission and everything that God's called you to do you need to fall on that altar cannot bring any of your denominational thoughts you cannot bring any of your ideologies you cannot bring any of your ambitions and I know I'm preaching to myself right now because you know I you know we all have our things and yeah so I fall on the altar oh Jesus help me help me Lord oh my that else has been restored do you realize this is you've give approach the approach to God the real approach not some rosary beads or some crawling up steps on on your knees or some you know shake the hand with the preacher some baptize three face forwards for backwards and sideways and whatever but the real Christian apostolic approach to God has been restored and the alt has been repaired and the heart to be turned back and the realest direction pal has been released in the open books here and he's knocking on doors will you open he's got a book he's got some wine what's the change you're thinking Amen you know if you drink enough wine you'll change your thinking all right amen you'll be talking that you'll be speaking the truth by parcel reasoning hallelujah hallelujah this epistemic faith drunk they came out of that room and they were stumbling and they were just they know what hit them and this is how God say melt Twelve Apostles foundation else has been restored fall on it and people lay your life completely everything ok you'll go beyond the veil can I have the musicians please your song about them falling on the altar or something huh see we probably don't know it though I let's sing it's sing that song Lord prepare me a man to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried injury man Apsara you're playing it's free this one structure here Romans 12:1 it says I beg you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and finally Matthew 7:21 about the will of God here not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which so therefore the will of God as the manifested design in your hour in your day in your generation God has a will God has a plan and if you want to know the plan if you want to know the world if you want to know what God wants for you to do in your life right now in this generation if you want to find the will of God fall on the outter that's been fall on it

of mysteries or teachings but there's a person calling a bride the message of John was calling the bride John was the best man he was happy to see the bridegroom and his voice sounding and the same thing is repeating again for there's nothing new Under the Sun can anyone say that this hasn't happened and that it won't happen again these same things repeat themselves as the Soliman see and father I pray Lord that you just touch life and if there's anybody in here just show to the Lord with uplifted hand if there's a big bit there's an altar for you to follow it's been restored the approach has
