[3:30] I
[3:34] [Music]
[4:46] praise the Lord welcome to church this
[4:49] morning it's good to see you
[4:51] [Music]
[4:53] all you know something it feels like a
[4:56] little
[4:58] uh Mar phone near my heart when I'm down
[5:02] there it would be going slowly
[5:06] like boom
[5:09] boom this never gets old coming up here
[5:11] it's always a bit nerve-wracking you
[5:12] know with then the minute I walk up here
[5:14] it starts
[5:15] going if you could hear
[5:19] it but it's a good thing you know we we
[5:22] don't want to get common when we
[5:24] approach the things of God like it it
[5:26] always should be something that we
[5:30] are sincere about and that that that we
[5:33] reverence you know I think I'd start to
[5:35] get worried if there wasn't a a
[5:38] nervousness in me when I'm walking up
[5:39] here if it was just like no thought at
[5:42] all I'd be quite like worried about
[5:45] myself like I'm in a bad way you know
[5:47] but but I think I think God sees our
[5:50] heart like that and he realizes these
[5:51] people are sincere before me and he and
[5:54] he he feels welcome because he's
[5:56] actually a
[5:57] gentleman he never pushes in never never
[5:59] never intrudes he he only comes where
[6:01] he's wanted you know and when he sees
[6:04] that feels that he's wanted he actually
[6:06] cuz he so wants to come he so wants to
[6:09] meet and when he feels welcome and
[6:10] wanted then he comes in he's always
[6:12] there always always comes where he where
[6:15] he welcome so we we were just praying in
[6:17] the um room just before the service here
[6:20] and you know one of the prayers was that
[6:22] we would you know through that that we
[6:25] would hear from the heart of God this
[6:26] morning and I believe that's what we are
[6:28] going to
[6:30] you know what what will happen and we we
[6:31] we just prayed Lord May the May the
[6:32] praise and the worship just get us into
[6:34] a place to where we can connect with
[6:36] your heart Lord and and hear from you
[6:37] this morning Lord because the Lord's got
[6:39] a heart that he wants to share and and
[6:41] we want to connect with that this
[6:42] morning and I pray that you know he'd
[6:44] bless brother Ben is brother Ben would
[6:46] also be nervous but may may he step out
[6:49] of the way and let the spirit of God
[6:51] come and just speak the heart of God to
[6:53] us this morning you know such a great
[6:54] responsibility but I'm so glad for a man
[6:56] that that is willing to put himself as
[6:59] decid to do that this morning and I just
[7:01] want to pray a blessing on the the those
[7:03] of us the the the Brethren that are a
[7:05] part of us that are away this morning
[7:07] even though you know even though you're

[37:31] the same said unto me upon whom Thou
[37:34] shalt see the spirit descending and
[37:36] remaining on the same is he which
[37:38] baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw
[37:42] and bear record that this is the Son of
[37:43] God again the next day after uh John
[37:46] stood and two of his disciples and

[38:47] so father we thank you we can come into
[38:49] your presence this morning we don't take
[38:50] it for granted Lord that we can stand in
[38:52] the presence of the almighty Lord Of
[38:54] Glory the high King Of Heaven father we
[38:56] thank you Lord for this privilege and we
[38:58] ask that you'll take the service under
[39:00] your Great Divine control Lord we don't
[39:02] want to gather just to see one another
[39:03] though that is wonderful but we want to
[39:05] see you Lord You're the one we've come
[39:07] to worship praise adore and tell tell
[39:09] how much we love Lord is you so dear God
[39:11] as we've read your word we're asking
[39:13] once again you being the great Eternal
[39:15] author of your word may you come live it
[39:17] Lord in our lives interpret it to our
[39:19] hearts father may you grant it we love
[39:21] you Lord we also want to remember those
[39:24] who couldn't be here today they're

[39:27] especially want to remember oh my Robin
[39:29] father unwell this morning dear God has

[39:33] your body Lord whatever is wrong Lord we
[39:34] know that you know all about it so
[39:37] father may you diagnose the case may
[39:39] touch your life Lord because we're
[39:40] believing as we can look into Moses's
[39:42] great medical chest Lord and open it up
[39:45] and it says I'm the Lord that heals all
[39:46] Thy Thy diseases so father May touch you
[39:49] Lord anyone else who's um unwell as well
[39:51] Grant it father For Your Glory in Jesus
[39:53] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[39:56] friends you can have your seats this
[39:58] morning so I want to speak on blessed
[40:00] are the pure in heart for they shall see
[40:02] God amen amen now this is one of the
[40:04] most outstanding when when John would
[40:07] stand here and say Behold the Lamb of
[40:09] God and we know when uh Jesus was
[40:11] baptized you know John saw the spirit of
[40:13] God descended upon him like a dove and
[40:15] brother Bram would say this is the one
[40:17] one of the most outstanding events in
[40:19] Scripture that heaven and earth United
[40:22] that man and God became one and as Jesus
[40:26] would say in the be udes blessed are the
[40:28] pure in heart for they shall see God now
[40:30] to me this seeing God is Not Just well
[40:32] one day in glory we'll see him but no
[40:35] this is in everyday life you shall see
[40:37] him so the pure in heart will see God
[40:39] the impure in heart will not see God so
[40:42] I pray that we're all pure in heart this
[40:44] morning and if we're not by the end of
[40:46] the service we'll we'll really say Lord
[40:48] purify My Heart Lord amen so this word
[40:51] pure has got a many many different uh
[40:53] definitions but just want to take this
[40:55] one you of course it means clean pure
[40:57] purified by fire and different things
[41:00] but free from uh every ad mixture of
[41:02] that which is false it's sincere it's
[41:04] genuine now as we heard on Wednesday we
[41:07] know there's many devices in the man's
[41:08] you know you in a man's heart but I pray
[41:11] that our heart of hearts is is genuine
[41:13] it's not a mixture of things it's not a
[41:15] mixture of true and false or or carnal
[41:18] and and and divine but it's all God now
[41:21] we understand I'm just going to go
[41:22] through some things before we go into
[41:24] some more serious things but you know we
[41:26] know that we're living in the age of
[41:27] ladyo and now I I just Googled protest
[41:30] things and I thought this is the one
[41:31] that doesn't stand on anyone's toes
[41:33] where they uh this is in America they
[41:35] you know they're they're uh protesting
[41:37] against different things and then
[41:38] there's that guy who's honest who says
[41:40] we have no idea what we're talking about
[41:42] you know but you see the thing is this
[41:44] is the age of Lady oia this is the age
[41:46] of people's rights but we've got to we
[41:48] got to understand that in the you know
[41:50] and many many things people protest for
[41:52] they are just and good but I can
[41:54] guarantee you people who get deep into
[41:56] anything they'll never be remain pure in
[41:59] heart they will always begin to come to
[42:01] a place where they justify lying for
[42:03] their cause no matter what it is it can
[42:04] be a very good cause it can be right but
[42:07] those who get too deep in it they will
[42:09] end up lying for their side they're no
[42:11] longer pure in heart so there's a
[42:13] challenge in this day can we live in
[42:15] this world but not of this world can we
[42:17] live un untangled by everything that's
[42:20] going on around us there's a lot going
[42:22] on around us different things are going
[42:24] on but can we can we stand in the midst
[42:26] of it falling from both sides like the
[42:28] prophet said saying there's a better way
[42:30] to live which is in the resurrection
[42:32] power of Jesus Christ The Living Word of
[42:34] God you see so it's like you know
[42:36] politicians I don't you know or any
[42:38] social justice Warrior or
[42:39] environmentalist or whoever it may be
[42:41] you know I doubt very much they start
[42:44] with the intent they're going to become
[42:45] Shady crooked people like people who get
[42:48] into politics I don't think that they're
[42:49] there to say let's Wrangle a deal let's
[42:51] do something that's crooked no they have
[42:53] a genuine desire I want to make my
[42:55] country better I want to to solve
[42:57] problems I want to you know create
[42:59] Solutions I want you know all those
[43:00] things but they get into the spirit of
[43:02] politics and you see where they end up
[43:04] amen so they don't stay pure in heart
[43:07] and no one in these things does stay
[43:08] pure in heart sadly doesn't matter how
[43:10] good the person is they always lie for
[43:12] their cause we never want to lie for our
[43:14] cause whatever our cause is right we
[43:16] don't need to lie for this message
[43:18] that's for sure God brings his word to
[43:20] pass he interprets his word right he
[43:21] proves his word but we never want to get
[43:23] so entangled by things that we're no
[43:26] longer pure and heart but the world
[43:28] wants to entangle you that's for sure I
[43:30] guarantee you that much amen so now as
[43:34] you read the purpose the purpose of
[43:36] being pure and heart is that you'll see
[43:38] God and not just every day I mean sorry
[43:41] not just one day but you'll see the
[43:42] supernatural hand of God every day in
[43:45] your life now Jesus is our example right
[43:48] who wants to be like Jesus amen I I
[43:50] believe that's why we gather we want to
[43:52] be like him now Jesus you if I could say
[43:54] this as a man he saw God every day in
[43:56] his life he saw the spirit of God
[43:59] leading him he said the son can do
[44:00] nothing till the father shows him and
[44:02] what the uh father does the son does
[44:04] likewise so he was led by Vision you say
[44:06] well I'm not I've never seen a vision in
[44:08] my life and some of us will never see
[44:10] Visions but there should be a pulsation
[44:12] of the Holy Ghost in our hearts that
[44:14] directs us guides us corrects us amen
[44:17] and that's the same as seeing God right
[44:19] because you see God's hand in your life
[44:21] so he was you know we know Jesus as as
[44:24] as John would say Behold the Lamb of God
[44:26] that takes away the of the world and his
[44:28] so his heart he was he was a lamb right
[44:31] he had the same emotional realm like we
[44:33] do he was a man like us right so he
[44:37] wasn't made different in that sense he
[44:39] he could be sad angry bitter jealous
[44:41] Envy Strife malice hatred he could have
[44:44] all those emotions he could hold grudges
[44:46] if he wanted to he was built that way he
[44:48] was built like you and I friends you
[44:50] know sure he was born sinless but yet he
[44:52] had that same he could have been a
[44:54] bitter man yeah he had every right to be
[44:56] an angry butter callous man he had every
[44:58] right Amen to to be that but no he knew
[45:01] he was the Lamb of God and he stayed as
[45:04] the Lamb of God Amen and we know that
[45:06] the reason that he stayed the Lamb of
[45:08] God is because he was our sacrifice
[45:11] right but then also he had to be the
[45:13] Lamb of God that the dove of God could
[45:15] descend upon him the Holy Ghost and
[45:17] brother Braham teaches it very well that
[45:19] he says that you know a lamb and a dove
[45:21] have the same kind of a nature that a
[45:23] dove would never descend upon a wolf
[45:24] never would descend upon any kind of
[45:26] Beast of you know a hyena or some kind
[45:28] of wicked creature no it's got to have
[45:30] the same nature their Natures must blend
[45:32] together and if the natures are contrary
[45:34] then the Holy Ghost would never have
[45:35] descended upon him I trust you're with
[45:36] me this morning right so he had to have
[45:38] a lamb nature and brother Bram tells us
[45:40] that that the reason that we don't see
[45:42] God in our lives is because we don't
[45:44] have that lamb nature anymore amen the
[45:46] joy of our Salvation the peace of God
[45:48] goes out of us because we let that
[45:50] carnal nature we're born with rise up
[45:52] and take preeminence and the dove takes
[45:53] her flight amen but he says now that and
[45:56] and and so when that happens you won't
[45:58] see God in your life right well then
[46:02] what do you do and I'll come to the end
[46:03] of my service just become a lamb again
[46:06] right just become a lamb again amen
[46:08] because you want his nature to match
[46:10] your nature you say well I know all the
[46:12] doctrine of the message that's all fine
[46:14] the devil does too I know the Bible back
[46:16] to front that's good the devil does too
[46:18] but he can't have the nature of a lamb I
[46:20] mean he can't have God's Own nature and
[46:22] the Bible says that we would be
[46:24] partakers of the divine nature I mean
[46:26] what is is that that's a lamb nature
[46:28] amen
[46:30] amen hallelujah see we got to we got to
[46:34] allow the lamb nature to take over and
[46:38] stay in in charge CU we are the Lambs of
[46:42] God right remember the Book of
[46:44] Revelation says his wife you know the
[46:46] marriage of the Lamb has come so what's
[46:48] going to a lamb will marry a lamb same
[46:51] Natures will blend together right and
[46:52] this is the marriage season is going on
[46:54] right now and so brother Braham says now
[46:56] you know sometimes I wonder if that's
[46:58] the reason there's so much trouble in
[46:59] the church if we are the Lambs of God we
[47:02] should have the nature of a lamb if we
[47:04] expect the dove to abide you believe it
[47:07] I do now if you'll watch the dove the
[47:09] reason it stayed on the lamb because
[47:11] their Natures was the same and the
[47:13] reason that the dove stayed on stays on
[47:14] a Christian he will stay there as long
[47:17] as he is a lamb but when he takes a
[47:19] different nature the dove will take its
[47:21] flight you see this Dove was first a
[47:23] spotless lamb the Bible said he was a
[47:25] spotless lamb and the lamb could not
[47:27] depend upon his own travel a lamb had to
[47:29] be led or guided or shepherded you see
[47:32] and we always as I've said before we are
[47:34] always will be the Lambs of God doesn't
[47:36] matter how old we are how experienced we
[47:38] think in our Christian Life we always
[47:40] will be Lambs we always need to be led
[47:42] brother brah says the big problem is we
[47:44] get our heads so full of Christian
[47:45] knowledge we think we can lead ourselves
[47:48] the dove takes its flight when you are
[47:49] dependent upon yourself the Holy Ghost
[47:52] takes its flight you say well you know
[47:56] does that mean I lose my salvation no
[47:58] but you'll sure lose your Victory you'll
[48:00] sure lose your joy and you won't see God
[48:03] Amen but we want to see God don't we in
[48:05] everyday life Lord I want to see you
[48:06] live I want to see your word manifested
[48:08] I want to see you prove yourself amen
[48:10] that's what we want amen and brother BR
[48:12] would say you know he said and um I've
[48:14] heard it but now I see you know brother
[48:16] Jack Moore would say to him you know um
[48:18] you know I guess you you he said one of
[48:20] the greatest messages you ever preached
[48:22] in Shri Port was the lamb and the dove
[48:24] but he'd say well I guess you know uh
[48:26] but your message being so strenuous
[48:28] today you don't get to preach those kind
[48:30] of things and then brother R said well
[48:32] when I miss that I miss my
[48:35] message so if we if we forget this part
[48:38] we've actually missed the message of the
[48:39] hour Amen to be the Lambs of God amen
[48:43] amen because we want to see God
[48:46] now as as would say in Timothy you know
[48:49] but all those henceforth there is laid
[48:52] up for me a Crown of Life of I me crown
[48:54] of righteousness which the Lord the
[48:55] righteous judge shall give me at that
[48:57] day and not to me only but also to them
[48:59] that love his glorious um appearing I
[49:03] mean that love is appearing now brother
[49:04] says the appearing is going on now what
[49:06] is that happening that's God proving his
[49:08] word in our lives I mean you shall see
[49:11] God you shall see the supernatural
[49:12] you'll see the power to forgive you'll
[49:14] see that you can't hold a grudge why
[49:16] because you see God Amen you see the
[49:18] Lord moving right amen because you know
[49:21] see we have to have a pure lamb heart
[49:25] anything contrary to that nature the the
[49:28] you know the dove will never abide and
[49:31] so we can't be a wolf we can't have
[49:32] anything that's contrary to the nature
[49:34] of a lamb not a goat that kicks and you
[49:37] know kicks kicks against everything and
[49:38] eats anything right we don't want to
[49:41] have that God of a nature right no we
[49:43] can't be as cunning of a um as a fox you
[49:45] cannot be cunning as a fox in your heart
[49:48] right no we got to have a pure heart
[49:51] amen see see the Holy Ghost wants to
[49:53] take your soul that that it is his AB
[49:57] Abode forever amen see so we got to be
[50:00] willing to surrender our schemes and our
[50:01] plans surrender our own ambition Amen to
[50:05] be the greatest Church we've got to
[50:07] speak about a see many say well I have a
[50:12] a a pure heart but they forget the
[50:13] purpose of why they're doing
[50:15] things I mean see see what what what are
[50:18] we here for that the last one will come
[50:21] in what are we here for that God will
[50:24] prove his word in its completion amen
[50:26] everything God spoke of the Christian
[50:28] Church would be manifested here right
[50:31] but we've got to have a nature of a lamb
[50:33] for it to happen amen see do we love his
[50:36] appearing do you love his presence in
[50:38] your life does it mean more than life to
[50:40] you to have his presence in you to know
[50:42] that he is your God and he dwells in
[50:44] your soul is he more than your next meal
[50:46] to you is he more than whatever your
[50:48] plans are over Christmas does he mean
[50:50] more do you love his appearing amen I
[50:53] say if you're pure in heart you will
[50:55] love his appearing amen but it takes a
[50:57] pure a pure heart to do it a pure heart
[51:00] does not have any selfish gain in it
[51:03] Hallelujah it does not do anything based
[51:05] on what it wants to
[51:08] do
[51:10] now there is an occasion in the book of
[51:12] Acts where where where um where in uh
[51:15] the uh city of Samaria there was a
[51:17] revival going on and there was a man
[51:19] there called Simon the Sorcerer And he
[51:21] was he he was you know he was a great
[51:24] man uh among the city but then he got
[51:26] caught up in what God was doing and even
[51:28] says in the scripture that he got
[51:29] baptized he became one of the Believers
[51:31] and then he and then when Peter uh Peter
[51:33] came down into the city he laid his
[51:35] hands on the Believers they received the
[51:36] Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost didn't
[51:38] fall on him and he was wondering you you
[51:41] know he he even thought well maybe if I
[51:44] give some money you know I can get this
[51:46] gift and then I can impart eternal life
[51:48] who doesn't want to impart eternal life
[51:50] that's right as a Believer but what's
[51:52] the motive in doing it you see his
[51:54] motive is look I can I can ear ear a bit
[51:56] of bit of coin out of this
[51:59] deal right I can earn a bit of prestige
[52:02] what will people will think highly of me
[52:04] oh I'm a spiritual I've really deep cuz
[52:07] God Lives I've got the mechanics and the
[52:09] Dynamics I've really made it that's
[52:10] selfish ambition I guarantee you that's
[52:13] not the dove leading you that's a wolf
[52:16] nature leading you but you see even even
[52:18] Peter would because he came to Peter
[52:20] says look you know can I buy this I want
[52:22] to I want to be part of the Believers I
[52:23] want to be an afficial part of the body
[52:25] of Christ
[52:27] but Peter says look your heart's not
[52:28] right in the sight of God you're you're
[52:31] all bound up with B the gall of buness
[52:33] and the bond of iniquity see his heart
[52:36] was not pure see he saw what God was
[52:39] doing supernaturally but he did not see
[52:42] God's plan and that's a big thing we can
[52:45] see God move but you got to see the pure
[52:46] in heart will see God they will see his
[52:49] Plan of Redemption they will see what
[52:51] God wants done in their
[52:53] lives praise the Lord amen amen see we
[52:59] got to be careful many people do the
[53:01] right thing because it's expected of
[53:03] them so outwardly they do it because
[53:06] it's expected of them but what's going
[53:08] on in their heart what's their motive
[53:09] what is your motive in serving the
[53:12] body I just say I'm going to throw some
[53:14] questions out there sorry this is this
[53:16] is not a dialogue but I just want you to
[53:17] think about these things what is the why
[53:19] do you serve the body that people will
[53:22] think you're something will people will
[53:23] think you're servant hearted or are you
[53:25] genuinely servant hearted
[53:27] I mean do you do it because you know
[53:29] well it's expected of me and then you
[53:30] feel sorry for yourself that's not a
[53:32] pure heart a pure heart is Lord I get to
[53:35] serve the body of Christ your redeemed
[53:37] ones I get to come in contact with the
[53:40] with the promise of the ages the bride
[53:42] of Christ the finality of that bride I
[53:44] get to serve part of that body I get to
[53:46] rub shoulders with the Eternal amen amen
[53:49] amen I get to rub shoulders with the
[53:51] prophecy fulfilled the word being made
[53:53] flesh amen so a pure heart you see
[53:56] brother BR would make this uh you know
[53:58] make this comment he says now I can't I
[54:02] can't see nothing but the grace of God
[54:04] that's my makeup I always did believe in
[54:06] grace I'm just Grace all over that's all
[54:09] of it isn't even in my life when I was a
[54:11] boy I couldn't see nothing but Grace
[54:12] Grace Just Grace Grace they say I'll
[54:15] scratch my back and I and I'll scratch
[54:17] yours well that's an awful expression
[54:19] I'll say that's not a lamb expression
[54:21] that's a wolf expression that's a self-
[54:23] ambitious expression I don't care
[54:25] whether you scratch mine or not if yours
[54:27] needs scratching I'll scratch you anyhow
[54:29] see grace yes sir see grace works by
[54:31] love I mean if you need it regardless of
[54:34] if you've never done nothing for me if I
[54:36] don't have one thing to do with you um
[54:39] sorry I don't have one thing to to do
[54:42] with you if you need it I'll do it
[54:44] anyhow Grace be be because that you need
[54:47] it he says look I'm not looking see a
[54:50] pure heart is not looking to see what it
[54:52] can get back it just wants to give you
[54:54] need a hand I'm here I've got two yeah
[54:57] right you know you need a help I'm here
[54:59] you need a someone to pray with you I'm
[55:00] here you a selfish heart a pure heart
[55:03] does not look at what it can get in
[55:06] return I mean a selfish heart wants to
[55:08] look a pure heart I have trust I don't
[55:10] get this mixed up but you know what I
[55:11] mean right a pure Heart's Not Looking
[55:13] for return it's not an investment I sew
[55:17] into my life therefore you've got to sew
[55:19] back into mine right no that's a pure
[55:21] heart never looks that way I mean a pure
[55:24] heart does not feel sorry for itself
[55:26] when it it's
[55:27] helping it's motiv is Lord praise God I
[55:31] can bless I can bless your bride amen I
[55:34] can bless your people Lord praise the
[55:36] Lord amen I get an opportunity to be
[55:38] good to your bride hallelujah
[55:41] hallelujah because I Love You Lord
[55:44] that's my motive that should be our
[55:46] motive should be the love of God Amen
[55:48] see a pure heart helps without thinking
[55:51] of recognition yeah well you know
[55:54] brother B says he likes recognition it's
[55:56] nice when people say you did a good job
[55:58] right we're human but we don't help
[56:00] because of those things oh my
[56:02] recognition Tally's gone down this week
[56:04] this is not right I'm not you know no we
[56:06] should never think that way a pure heart
[56:09] don't get offended if it's not thanked
[56:10] enough or at
[56:12] all well that I didn't get what I
[56:15] expected that's not a pure heart am mean
[56:17] a pure heart is not offended if they're
[56:20] not even mentioned or seen it's the
[56:23] behind the scenes things that are
[56:25] important but we should never think well
[56:26] no one recognized me doing it God sees
[56:28] you remember we should do everything to
[56:31] each other as unto the Lord because many
[56:34] times we look back and say man I wish
[56:36] Lord I could wash your feet when your
[56:38] feet were not washed in Simon's I wish I
[56:40] could have kissed you and made you feel
[56:41] welcome Lord I wish I could have
[56:43] welcomed you in under you from from from
[56:45] out of the hot sun into the cool of the
[56:47] room and made you feel so welcome we can
[56:50] when we when we serve one another we're
[56:52] doing that if you've got a see the pure
[56:54] and heart will see God they'll see God
[56:55] and one another they'll see the word and
[56:57] flesh in the body of
[57:00] Christ amen so we can't go back and say
[57:02] I wish I could have done that for you
[57:03] now and you don't do it here right
[57:06] because the pure in heart they just they
[57:07] just do it as unto the Lord am mean a
[57:10] pure in heart is not offended if someone
[57:12] doesn't shake their hand or greet them
[57:14] or talk to them at church there should
[57:16] be no offense in us oh that brother
[57:19] didn't shake my hand so that sister and
[57:23] why do you come do you do you come to
[57:24] church just to get your hand shaking
[57:27] I'm just making it sound ridiculous
[57:28] because it is people get offended and
[57:30] they stop coming to church because they
[57:31] didn't get greeted enough brother
[57:34] cabin's there that's all the greeting I
[57:36] need all
[57:38] week he makes me feel welcome you know
[57:41] praise God
[57:43] Amen but even if he didn't shake my hand
[57:46] doesn't mean I'm going to quit and I'm
[57:47] not coming to this place anymore no I'm
[57:49] not come I don't come here I'm not I I
[57:53] don't want to make this a joke but you
[57:54] got to think about it people actually
[57:56] literally stop coming to church because
[57:58] they feel offended because people don't
[58:00] shake their hand
[58:02] really and you go you go all other kind
[58:05] of places you don't get
[58:10] offended see well that brother or sister
[58:13] snubbed me so what if they
[58:17] did Brother BR makes a statement he says
[58:20] that God will allow the whole church to
[58:21] turn against you to see what you'll
[58:25] do what are you going to do oh well I'm
[58:28] going to go off on my py party that
[58:30] ain't going to help you that just breeds
[58:32] more wolves in your lives I don't want
[58:33] to pack of wolves or a pack of dogs in
[58:35] here I want them all dead I want the
[58:37] Lamb of God just to reign supreme in
[58:39] everything I do amen see why do we why
[58:42] do we come to church I come here to
[58:44] worship God you say well no you come
[58:46] because you're the pastor I'll guarantee
[58:48] you if I was not the pastor of this
[58:49] church I'd be here am mean if I never
[58:52] had any kind of public kind of thing in
[58:54] the front F in the back the time I'd say
[58:56] praise God cuz I would want to he I
[58:58] would worship God in spirit and in truth
[59:00] I come to church to tell tell this world
[59:03] this is this is the side I've picked cuz
[59:05] God found me when I was lost and undone
[59:06] so I'm I'm telling the world this side
[59:09] I'm on this side I'm on jesus' side the
[59:11] words called me to stand by his sight
[59:13] say Lord I'm here amen that's why that's
[59:16] why I come to church I don't come to
[59:18] church cuz I'm the pastor of the church
[59:19] it's got nothing to do with it amen a
[59:23] pure someone who's pure in heart they
[59:26] friendships with brother and brothers
[59:27] and sisters in the church are not based
[59:29] upon the office or influence that person
[59:32] holds because the Bible says to have
[59:35] respector if person is sin absolutely
[59:38] right so you don't buddy buddy up to the
[59:40] whoever you think are the important
[59:41] people in the church just because they
[59:42] are that
[59:43] way all right I'm just reading through
[59:46] these points a pure in heart does not
[59:48] name
[59:49] drop someone who's an authority to push
[59:52] their agenda or distorts what they might
[59:53] have said I remember like yesterday this
[59:56] is a four-year-old but but adults do it
[59:58] too
[59:59] okay William came out to me can I do
[1:00:02] whatever I said no you can't maybe it's
[1:00:04] jumping on the trampoline cuz he wanted
[1:00:06] his turn I said no not now okay then I
[1:00:09] hear him run outside girls dad said I
[1:00:14] can jump on the trampoline now what is
[1:00:16] he doing he his he's a four-year-old
[1:00:19] okay he wants to jump on the
[1:00:22] trampoline right human nature I want
[1:00:24] something okay but what did he do he Nam
[1:00:28] drop someone in Authority I've just told
[1:00:31] him the opposite or it's not his time
[1:00:33] but he'll name drop me to get what he
[1:00:35] wants I say that's not a lamb nature
[1:00:38] lamb but he's a four-year-old you expect
[1:00:40] four-year-olds to be like that a cuz
[1:00:42] they're fall right but then you get
[1:00:44] adult what they call mature Christians
[1:00:47] who will name drop Pastor pastor's wife
[1:00:49] Deacon Deacon's wife whatever and say
[1:00:50] well they said this and and really if
[1:00:53] people took what people said of what
[1:00:55] what we have said they think men they're
[1:00:57] crazy but they name drop to what to to
[1:01:00] sway things how they think things should
[1:01:02] be oh hold on maybe I need to release
[1:01:05] some press statements or something this
[1:01:08] is the official you know like was it in
[1:01:10] America they have their political ads
[1:01:11] and you know I Donald Trump approves you
[1:01:13] know approved this message kind of deal
[1:01:15] you know but the thing is there's a
[1:01:16] problem it's not a pure nature it's not
[1:01:19] a nature of a lamb to use people in
[1:01:21] authority to swing things your way
[1:01:23] amen amen we should not do that say to
[1:01:28] be pure pure in heart is to do the right
[1:01:32] thing just because it's not
[1:01:34] expected amen we do everything as unto
[1:01:37] the Lord our whole makeup and motive and
[1:01:39] objective should be Lord I'm just
[1:01:41] thankful you found me that should be our
[1:01:44] life that should be the motivation of
[1:01:45] your life Lord I'm so thankful you saved
[1:01:47] me you found me I wanted to go the other
[1:01:50] direction I sure did but goodness and
[1:01:53] mercy followed me got a hold of me
[1:01:55] turned me around and I'm so thankful he
[1:01:57] did not quit on me so that should be the
[1:02:00] motivation of our life that that will
[1:02:01] give you a lamb nature when you think
[1:02:03] about that you wanted to go that way God
[1:02:05] said no I'm not going to let you go you
[1:02:08] can't go that way you go my way thank
[1:02:10] you Lord amen glory amen now David would
[1:02:15] wait here where are we here making sure
[1:02:17] I'm lining up here
[1:02:20] now David was called a man after God's
[1:02:23] Own
[1:02:24] Heart what a test Tony wouldn't wouldn't
[1:02:26] you like God to say that about
[1:02:29] you she or he was a was a Believer after
[1:02:33] my own heart amen that shall see I have
[1:02:36] found David the son of Jesse a man after
[1:02:38] my own heart which shall fulfill all my
[1:02:41] will amen I want to fulfill all of God's
[1:02:44] will not just part of it all of his will
[1:02:46] all of his word Lord fulfill it in my
[1:02:48] life Lord amen concerning a Believer now
[1:02:51] if you look at the heart of David David
[1:02:53] had David had the nature of a of a lamb
[1:02:56] he had a nature of a lamb see he was he
[1:02:59] was the kind of a man he said Lord as
[1:03:01] the heart panth for the water Brook
[1:03:03] after the water book so panteth my soul
[1:03:05] after thee Oh God see he wanted to be in
[1:03:07] the presence of God and knew that the
[1:03:09] you know the heart the which is the deer
[1:03:11] you know thirsts for life it needs water
[1:03:14] if it's been torn by you know maybe a
[1:03:16] wolf or something and it got away it
[1:03:18] must get to water to drink it so he knew
[1:03:20] that that this desire in his heart was a
[1:03:22] life or death kind of desire he said my
[1:03:24] soul thirst is for God for the Living
[1:03:27] God When shall I come and and and appear
[1:03:29] before him then he'd say in Psalms 84 he
[1:03:32] said for a day in thy courts is better
[1:03:34] than a thousand I'd rather be a
[1:03:36] doorkeeper in the house of my God than
[1:03:39] dwell in the tents of wickedness now you
[1:03:41] think about this a doorkeeper doesn't
[1:03:43] even go
[1:03:44] in a doorkeeper keeps the door so it's
[1:03:47] like for example if I was a doorkeeper
[1:03:49] of here I'd be standing outside the
[1:03:51] front door I'd welcome everyone but I'd
[1:03:52] be outside I wouldn't even come I'd be
[1:03:55] on the side but he said I'd rather be
[1:03:57] that guy in the house of God than dwell
[1:04:00] in the tents of wickedness I'd rather
[1:04:02] just be there see he was pure in heart
[1:04:04] he was just satisfied just to be around
[1:04:06] the Lord amen that was a satisfying
[1:04:08] portion Lord to be in your presence that
[1:04:10] makes me happy that that satisfies me
[1:04:14] see a pure in heart don't care what part
[1:04:15] of the body of Christ they are they're
[1:04:18] not they don't have selfish ambition to
[1:04:20] be the main one have the main influence
[1:04:21] be the be the public whatever no they
[1:04:24] don't care about that all they want want
[1:04:25] to do is serve God Amen
[1:04:29] see this is this is what this is what we
[1:04:31] should be amen we shouldn't be upset you
[1:04:35] know whatever God has made us we should
[1:04:37] just be content Lord Lord I'll be a one
[1:04:40] day in your presence is better than a
[1:04:43] thousand amen amen hallelujah this is
[1:04:47] this is how we you say
[1:04:51] well how do you get into that kind of a
[1:04:53] heart as I said before Lord I'm so
[1:04:56] thankful you found me I'm so thankful
[1:04:58] you called me I'm so thankful that I
[1:04:59] could hear your word in in my day I
[1:05:02] could see the I could see the Mighty God
[1:05:03] unveiled in my life in my day I can see
[1:05:06] your Plan of Redemption in me I'm not
[1:05:08] just looking back in history and say
[1:05:10] well God did this and brother BR no I
[1:05:12] see him today God today Lord I'm so
[1:05:14] thankful you saved me today I'm so
[1:05:16] thankful that salvation is real
[1:05:18] Redemption is a reality Amen to be Sav
[1:05:21] from sin is a reality amen that's what
[1:05:23] I'm thankful for amen that's not just a
[1:05:25] changing of a mindset trying to trying
[1:05:27] to do what's accepted no but to actually
[1:05:29] be changed from the inside by God that
[1:05:32] he can live in my life that that
[1:05:34] satisfies me that satisfies me Lord your
[1:05:37] goodness of Mercy has followed me all
[1:05:38] the days of my life that satisfies me
[1:05:40] Lord
[1:05:42] hallelujah amen just to be around where
[1:05:44] you're at God I'm happy it's like
[1:05:46] brother BR would tell the story of a
[1:05:48] there's a colored brother um America and
[1:05:50] he and you know he's on his on his
[1:05:52] deathbed and they thought he had died
[1:05:53] but he came back and they asked him MOS
[1:05:55] where were you he said well I was there
[1:05:58] in glory and an angel came and said Moos
[1:06:01] here's your here's your crown and your
[1:06:03] robe well done and he said don't talk to
[1:06:05] me out about a robe and a crown I just
[1:06:07] want to see him Hallelujah to me that's
[1:06:10] a that's a lamb nature who cares about
[1:06:14] rewards just to see him Hallelujah he's
[1:06:17] already paid it in
[1:06:19] full I feel so rewarded anyway if you
[1:06:22] care but no just to know him as life
[1:06:25] see a pure in heart that's all they care
[1:06:27] about they don't care about rewards
[1:06:29] don't care about recognition they just
[1:06:30] want to see him I want to said the Bible
[1:06:33] says in Revelations those are are sealed
[1:06:34] with the mark of God in their forehead
[1:06:36] shall see him face to face I that's more
[1:06:38] than a satisfying reward for me just to
[1:06:41] see the one who died for me I'm very
[1:06:43] happy with that
[1:06:45] hallelujah amen now you look at David
[1:06:48] David was an incredible man so you think
[1:06:50] about it there came a there came a stage
[1:06:52] in his life because remember his desire
[1:06:55] was he just wanted to be in God's
[1:06:56] presence that's all he cared about
[1:06:58] really more than being King more than
[1:07:00] whatever he just wanted to be where God
[1:07:02] was then he came to a stage in his life
[1:07:04] where where God gave him rest all around
[1:07:07] about him he was older in age now he
[1:07:09] hadd been you know running from Saul was
[1:07:11] over he was crowned King he you know the
[1:07:13] kingdom had been established all these
[1:07:15] things so he came to a stage where he
[1:07:17] says Lord I want to build you a
[1:07:19] house you've given me a great palace
[1:07:22] I've got this I live in a house of Cedar
[1:07:24] but God you dwell in tense I want to
[1:07:26] make you a house so you think about it
[1:07:28] here he is he has rest he doesn't have
[1:07:30] to go fight battles he's got the ability
[1:07:33] the resources and the time to build what
[1:07:37] he really wanted to do for God anyway
[1:07:40] think about it but then God turns around
[1:07:42] and tells him
[1:07:43] no you can't do this this is not your
[1:07:47] lot I'm not allowing you to do what you
[1:07:49] really want to do in life what you're a
[1:07:52] sole ambition is life I I'm not going to
[1:07:54] let you do it
[1:07:56] now David if he was not pure in heart he
[1:07:58] would have thrown a big hissy fit he
[1:08:00] would have built it anyway he had the
[1:08:02] Revelation he had the plans he had all
[1:08:04] those things God gave to he was said no
[1:08:06] I'm just going to do it anyway and as um
[1:08:08] you know someone clipped out I think
[1:08:09] brother Donnie Reagan asking a question
[1:08:11] can we be no
[1:08:13] Christians like David was a noch
[1:08:15] Christian God told him no and he said
[1:08:18] yes Lord yes Lord can we be that kind of
[1:08:21] a Believer this morning I mean when God
[1:08:23] says no even though because God knew
[1:08:25] David heart God knew you know it wasn't
[1:08:28] a shock to God that David said Lord I
[1:08:30] want to build you a house he would have
[1:08:31] seen this seen this desire building over
[1:08:35] the years I mean that's why he would
[1:08:37] have be David was rejoicing when the ark
[1:08:38] was carried into a city because he would
[1:08:40] have thought praise God now the I can
[1:08:43] come back into the city I can build him
[1:08:44] a temple he can have a place to dwell in
[1:08:47] worthy to his name greater than tent
[1:08:49] greater than this little you know
[1:08:51] Tabernacle and all these things no I can
[1:08:53] build him something that you know that
[1:08:55] that reflects what I think of him and
[1:08:58] yet God would tell him no and he and and
[1:09:02] God actually told him no to such a
[1:09:03] degree he said you'll never see
[1:09:05] it when you die your son will do it now
[1:09:11] can we be that kind of a believer that
[1:09:14] God God even knows it's our desire but
[1:09:16] he tells you
[1:09:18] no can you be that person that's a lamb
[1:09:21] nature Lord you're leading me I wanted
[1:09:23] to go this way and do the SE he wasn't
[1:09:25] doing anything contrary to his word he
[1:09:27] was doing something according to his
[1:09:28] word he wasn't going out into sin no
[1:09:30] he's wanting to do something for God but
[1:09:32] God said you can't do it and what did he
[1:09:36] do and you think about
[1:09:38] David can we be a no
[1:09:40] Christian balum was not a no kind of a
[1:09:43] Christian he worshiped God he knew God
[1:09:46] when God spoke to him he didn't say who
[1:09:48] are you he knew exactly who he was and
[1:09:50] God remember remember Moab hired balam
[1:09:53] to come and curse Israel right and then
[1:09:56] and then so so so the moabites um went
[1:09:58] to go get balum and balum said I'll pray
[1:10:01] about it that night God said don't do
[1:10:03] it now he didn't have a lamb nature he
[1:10:06] had a wolf carnal nature see he used the
[1:10:09] gift in his life for his own
[1:10:11] ends I pray none of us are in that
[1:10:14] condition that's a miserable horrible
[1:10:16] place to be that's a wolf nature see
[1:10:18] we're all born with a gift of respective
[1:10:19] of we you know got a lamb nature a wolf
[1:10:21] nature all gifted people and so balam he
[1:10:24] was told no by God God but he decided
[1:10:26] he's going to go anyhow you see and so
[1:10:28] he wasn't pure in heart he did not see
[1:10:31] God's Plan of Redemption he failed to
[1:10:33] see the smitten Rock following Israel he
[1:10:35] failed to see the brass serpent he sure
[1:10:37] did not hear the shout of the king in
[1:10:38] their Camp am mean he did not see the
[1:10:40] Plan of Redemption for Israel he did not
[1:10:42] see salvation had come to them they
[1:10:44] going into their inheritance he saw none
[1:10:46] of it because he was not pure in heart
[1:10:49] amen he was he he he did more than what
[1:10:53] God told him to do God told him no he
[1:10:54] says going anyhow can we be those kind
[1:10:57] of people where God says no we say yes
[1:10:59] Lord because you think about it when God
[1:11:02] do we have it here see you thy days will
[1:11:04] be fulfilled Thou shalt sleep with thy
[1:11:06] fathers he says now out of your own bals
[1:11:08] will come a son and he shall build a
[1:11:10] house for my name now David what did he
[1:11:14] do when he heard that he praised God and
[1:11:17] then he didn't just say now well he can
[1:11:20] he can sort it out because a pure and
[1:11:23] heart wants the best for every
[1:11:24] generation
[1:11:26] they never want to hold you say well you
[1:11:28] know David could have been well I had to
[1:11:30] fight my enemies I had to run from the
[1:11:31] king I had to go through hardship well
[1:11:32] my son can go through the same thing
[1:11:34] that's not pure in heart you know people
[1:11:37] like for example people have you know
[1:11:39] you know difficult newborns oh actually
[1:11:42] every newborn is difficult they're a
[1:11:43] baby and then people who are not pure in
[1:11:46] heart they'll say well I didn't have any
[1:11:47] help no one helped me with my children
[1:11:49] our difficult they can suffer like me
[1:11:51] that's not pure in heart pure in heart
[1:11:53] should be Lord I remember was like I
[1:11:56] don't want them to walk that way I want
[1:11:58] them to have it easier than I did amen
[1:12:00] and that's what we should be for the
[1:12:01] next Generation Lord I want to I want to
[1:12:04] make it easier for them I don't want to
[1:12:06] make it as sure we all had rugged roads
[1:12:08] maybe previous generations but they
[1:12:10] don't have to go through the same things
[1:12:12] see someone's got to break the cycle
[1:12:14] where it's Lord may I be a stepping
[1:12:16] stone for them that they can go higher
[1:12:18] than I can ever go may they they can
[1:12:20] climb higher than I could ever achieve
[1:12:21] Lord may I be a stepping stone you see
[1:12:24] the pure in heart will be that way David
[1:12:26] was pure and hard he said Lord well if
[1:12:28] I'm not going to build the temple I'm
[1:12:30] going to get all the material together
[1:12:32] and he did and he didn't just do that he
[1:12:35] L he said Lord inspire me to write songs
[1:12:38] that I will physically never hear when
[1:12:40] your temples built but Hallelujah and he
[1:12:42] didn't just do that but he called the
[1:12:45] singers and got them trained that when
[1:12:47] the dedication meetings came they didn't
[1:12:49] have to work out what to do that's right
[1:12:51] he got everything ready for that Temple
[1:12:54] to be built he made it so easy for
[1:12:56] Solomon that's right to fulfill the word
[1:12:59] of God should we not be the same way
[1:13:02] should we not have that same Heart Lord
[1:13:04] I want it easy for my children to serve
[1:13:07] God lord I want it easy for them to come
[1:13:09] into your presence Lord I want it easy
[1:13:10] for them to get victory in their lives I
[1:13:13] want it easy Lord for for you to move
[1:13:15] Among Us amen not that we you know they
[1:13:18] should never have to repeat the things
[1:13:19] we went through that's right we went
[1:13:22] through them for a for a for a purpose
[1:13:26] but that was
[1:13:27] us we don't ever want it just to be a
[1:13:30] repeat see David David could have David
[1:13:33] could have
[1:13:34] seriously uh what do you call it he
[1:13:38] could have sabotaged the temple being
[1:13:39] built because he was he was told he
[1:13:41] couldn't do it but he's pure in
[1:13:43] Heart Lord help
[1:13:46] us Amen brother Brown would speak about
[1:13:49] those who had gone on before him they
[1:13:51] would you know the early Pentecostals
[1:13:53] how they would stand on the um Street
[1:13:55] corn has been eggs throwing at that made
[1:13:57] fun of all those things the street
[1:13:58] meetings they had that he could stand in
[1:14:00] Auditorium and he could you know he
[1:14:02] could preach the way he did he said they
[1:14:04] paved the way for him are we paving the
[1:14:07] way for our
[1:14:09] families are we doing that I pray the
[1:14:11] pure in heart will because you know I
[1:14:13] doubt very much that the um you know you
[1:14:15] know those early Believers there kicked
[1:14:17] out of their churches they had to meet
[1:14:19] in Barns or or basements or on the
[1:14:21] street whatever more I doubt very much
[1:14:23] they saying Brethren we're Paving the
[1:14:25] away they just wanted to serve God they
[1:14:28] were just interested in Lord you have
[1:14:30] revealed your word to me amen I want you
[1:14:32] to live Lord I want freedom to worship
[1:14:34] you they weren't all all this big kind
[1:14:36] of this no they just they just were
[1:14:37] walking with
[1:14:39] God are we doing the same
[1:14:41] thing their motive was Lord I want you
[1:14:43] to
[1:14:45] live
[1:14:48] hallelujah praise the Lord a pure in
[1:14:51] heart will realize all things work
[1:14:53] together for good
[1:14:56] amen if you're pure in heart you realize
[1:14:58] yes Lord this is for my good amen even
[1:15:02] to have difficult look I think literally
[1:15:04] all of our babies were difficult
[1:15:06] babies I see people with newborns I
[1:15:08] don't think man well they better get
[1:15:10] what I
[1:15:11] got no my prayer is Lord may they have
[1:15:14] easy
[1:15:15] children amen and and if they're
[1:15:17] children are difficult Lord help them
[1:15:19] how can we make it easier for them
[1:15:22] because that happened to us for our good
[1:15:25] y God was molding Us in those days amen
[1:15:30] everything works together for our good
[1:15:31] see the pure in heart will say yes Lord
[1:15:33] you say well do you know what it's doing
[1:15:34] in your life that moment no do I need to
[1:15:38] know do I need God doesn't we don't have
[1:15:41] a stand up meeting every morning and God
[1:15:43] says now this and this is this is going
[1:15:44] to happen the pure and heart says Lord I
[1:15:46] trust you I don't understand but I Trust
[1:15:48] You Lord You're my shepherd you've
[1:15:50] proven yourself in the past you'll prove
[1:15:52] yourself again and you are proving
[1:15:53] yourself amen that's the pure in heart
[1:15:55] should be amen no they don't say well if
[1:15:57] they got difficult children they deserve
[1:15:59] it and all these things no the pure in
[1:16:01] heart says Lord how can I help see the
[1:16:03] pure and heart do not despise those who
[1:16:06] have it easier than them or or it's
[1:16:07] perceived that's a pure and heart they
[1:16:09] don't get resentful cuz others have an
[1:16:12] easier road than them we all have
[1:16:14] different battles not one battle is
[1:16:16] actually harder than the other because
[1:16:18] it's for you it'll be your hardest
[1:16:21] battle right someone may look over and
[1:16:23] say oh that's nothing cuz they've had a
[1:16:24] hard battle but you may look at their
[1:16:26] trial and say that's
[1:16:27] nothing cuz it's an individual walk we
[1:16:30] can never see the pure in heart does not
[1:16:32] judge one another by one another the
[1:16:35] pure and heart does not judge a church
[1:16:37] by a different Church we're all
[1:16:38] different this is not a franchise
[1:16:41] folks praise God this ain't a franchise
[1:16:44] friends every church is Sovereign
[1:16:46] because every church has different
[1:16:48] battles every church has different kind
[1:16:49] of people every church has is in a
[1:16:52] different
[1:16:53] location praise God so the word is
[1:16:56] preached slightly different at every
[1:16:58] church to meet the need in that
[1:17:00] church
[1:17:02] amen so we got to realize everything
[1:17:04] works together for our good
[1:17:09] Lord praise the Lord now the impure in
[1:17:13] heart will compare the impure in heart
[1:17:16] will will get
[1:17:18] jealous Saul had a jealous heart you
[1:17:21] notice this here this is after see when
[1:17:23] David returned from the slaughter of the
[1:17:24] Philistines sorry yeah uh that the woman
[1:17:28] came out of all the cities of Israel
[1:17:29] singing dancing to meet King Saul so
[1:17:32] they weren't even there to sing for
[1:17:33] David they there to sing sing for Saul
[1:17:36] amen then they sung the song D you David
[1:17:39] slaying his 10,000s and Saul is slain
[1:17:41] his thousands you see the pure in heart
[1:17:43] if Saul was pure in heart he said praise
[1:17:46] God praise God the next generation is
[1:17:49] mightier in battle than me praise God
[1:17:52] that they can breakthrough and prayer
[1:17:53] better than me praise God that God lives
[1:17:56] in their life more than me praise God
[1:17:58] they've seen more of the supernatural
[1:17:59] than me praise God their character is
[1:18:01] more like Christ than mej that should be
[1:18:03] the pure in heart you see but Saul was
[1:18:05] impure he got jealous he eyed David from
[1:18:08] that day forth you think about that how
[1:18:10] how Saul could have had it such a better
[1:18:12] way where he could have realized I have
[1:18:15] God's anointed champion in my in my Army
[1:18:20] in my nation I've got so I've got God's
[1:18:22] anointed man Hallelujah see if he was
[1:18:26] pure in heart he would have rallied
[1:18:27] around that gift and said God sure I
[1:18:29] failed you but Lord I'm going to build a
[1:18:31] platform this man will never fail you
[1:18:34] Hallelujah but you see people care so
[1:18:36] much about their reputation and what
[1:18:38] people think about them that's not being
[1:18:40] pure in heart you should care about what
[1:18:42] God thinks about you amen your
[1:18:44] reputation in heaven means a lot more
[1:18:45] than upon the Earth cuz the whole world
[1:18:47] could love you but what about in
[1:18:49] heaven that or the whole world can hate
[1:18:52] you but what about in heaven you see
[1:18:56] Saul did not have he wasn't he wasn't
[1:18:59] pure in heart see we should rejoice when
[1:19:03] the younger generation sings better than
[1:19:04] us am preaches better than us prays
[1:19:08] better than us is more Christlike at
[1:19:09] their age than we were Hallelujah
[1:19:12] shouldn't we be happier but man man you
[1:19:14] look at these young Fells here man I
[1:19:16] wasn't that guy when they were that you
[1:19:18] this age thank God you see I hear people
[1:19:21] that you know older one yeah well older
[1:19:24] than me but you you know you know
[1:19:27] they when their when their children go
[1:19:30] from being just children in the family
[1:19:32] to their identity now their own they
[1:19:34] become adults and then people start
[1:19:36] comparing well at that age I was better
[1:19:38] than that
[1:19:39] guy that's not pure in heart I was
[1:19:42] earning more money at your age then
[1:19:45] what's that got to do with with the
[1:19:46] price of fish who cares but it's an
[1:19:48] impure heart comparing I'm better than
[1:19:51] you that's the whole no we should be
[1:19:53] Lord I want them to be better than than
[1:19:55] me amen I want them to know you better
[1:19:58] than me Lord I want them to earn more I
[1:20:00] want them to have everything more than I
[1:20:02] have praise God that this how we should
[1:20:07] be if you do not have that heart you do
[1:20:09] not have the nature of a lamb if you get
[1:20:12] jealous of your children because they do
[1:20:13] better than you you have a wrong
[1:20:16] nature amen that's right praise God see
[1:20:19] it doesn't go about we are just thankful
[1:20:22] you know when we see God move we don't
[1:20:24] get jealous when it's in someone else's
[1:20:26] life and not our own the pure in heart
[1:20:28] just want to see God Amen And when they
[1:20:30] see God move they they're like Simeon of
[1:20:32] old in the temple when they picked up
[1:20:34] baby Jesus said Thank You Lord mine eyes
[1:20:36] have seen thy salvation we're just
[1:20:37] satisfied Lord You're fulfilling your
[1:20:39] word
[1:20:41] amen praise the
[1:20:44] Lord
[1:20:46] amen but you see David had
[1:20:52] moments we got to be careful how we
[1:20:55] treat one another the pure in heart do
[1:20:59] things without any selfish
[1:21:01] motive we don't want to be good to one
[1:21:03] another because then we can hold that as
[1:21:07] leverage as we read the quote earlier
[1:21:09] ago brother said I don't care if you
[1:21:11] scratch my back I'm just going to
[1:21:12] scratch yours because I'm graceful
[1:21:14] over now David David David In This
[1:21:18] Moment here
[1:21:21] see he actually I'm just going to jump
[1:21:23] back and forth to this
[1:21:28] because he said after he did
[1:21:30] this his heart smok him because he had
[1:21:33] cut off Saul's skirt so he was convicted
[1:21:36] because he because you realized In This
[1:21:38] Moment his men are saying look now you
[1:21:40] can you can end this thing we know
[1:21:42] you're anointed king this man is the
[1:21:44] obstacle standing in the way of your
[1:21:46] ministry this man is in the way of God
[1:21:49] fulfilling his word in your life this
[1:21:50] man's the problem look what he's done to
[1:21:52] you he's done this and this and this and
[1:21:54] this and David thought well you know he
[1:21:56] didn't want to kill him but he thought
[1:21:58] I'll just get one over him cuz Imagine
[1:22:01] The Leverage now that little rip piece
[1:22:02] of garment held that's
[1:22:05] right right Saul you see what I did to
[1:22:09] you you know what I could have done to
[1:22:13] you some people say they forgive but
[1:22:16] they don't
[1:22:17] forgive some people let things go they
[1:22:19] don't let things go in their heart they
[1:22:21] actually don't let it go it's leverag
[1:22:23] now against that person
[1:22:25] it's not pure in heart I'm not looking
[1:22:26] at anyone particular it's not pure in
[1:22:27] heart you see when you really forgive
[1:22:29] you forgive you say Well it still hurts
[1:22:31] but then you have a but in your heart
[1:22:33] you feel sorry for that person before
[1:22:36] the throne of grace you can actually
[1:22:37] pray for them right but you see this is
[1:22:40] why his heart's motive is because he was
[1:22:42] convicted because he went there with a
[1:22:44] wrong motive because he he did that to
[1:22:46] have leverage over Saul and this is why
[1:22:49] he is
[1:22:53] convicted see David David genuinely
[1:22:56] loved
[1:22:57] Saul he was pure in heart he did not
[1:23:00] hold he did not hold what Saul
[1:23:04] did against him when he died now we're
[1:23:07] just going to Sor we're going to find
[1:23:08] this
[1:23:11] here David no wait do I have this here
[1:23:15] is this
[1:23:19] wait all skirt no it's not there one
[1:23:25] here we
[1:23:26] are when David heard that Saul
[1:23:30] died he did not rent his clothes and
[1:23:32] weep because it was expected of
[1:23:34] him he did not he did not see see those
[1:23:37] who are in Pure Heart they don't just do
[1:23:38] things which are expected they do it out
[1:23:41] of a pure heart their motive is right
[1:23:42] it's not a selfish motive so when David
[1:23:44] ripped his clothes and rent them
[1:23:47] likewise his men did all the same
[1:23:48] because he was genuinely grieved that
[1:23:50] Saul his brother had fallen I mean David
[1:23:53] was grieved out of a pure heart for soul
[1:23:56] how do we feel about people that
[1:23:59] fall how do we feel about people that go
[1:24:01] into the
[1:24:02] world how do we feel do we have a
[1:24:04] genuine grief in our heart for that
[1:24:06] person or do we say well they deserved
[1:24:09] it they reap what you know you reap what
[1:24:11] you s see an impure heart will always
[1:24:13] bring scripture into it too just like a
[1:24:16] pure heart brings scripture impure heart
[1:24:17] brings scripture as well when when we
[1:24:20] see people fail when we see people fall
[1:24:23] do we in our hearts do we do we say well
[1:24:26] basically I told you so you know they
[1:24:29] they're now reaping what they sowed so
[1:24:31] they deserve it you know they should
[1:24:32] have listened to me is this how we feel
[1:24:35] or we genuinely grieve like like like
[1:24:38] David was see David David Grieves all
[1:24:41] out of a pure heart he was my brother in
[1:24:43] Christ the anointing of the Lord was
[1:24:45] upon Him amen the same Prophet that
[1:24:47] anointed me anointed him we're in the
[1:24:49] same Fellowship together amen he was a
[1:24:52] good pastor he paved the way for me
[1:24:55] he did he did pave the way for David
[1:24:58] right see David but David what about all
[1:25:02] the evil that he tried to do to you he
[1:25:04] tried to kill you more than once he
[1:25:05] hated You Without a Cause but a pure
[1:25:08] heart doesn't look at that amen it's
[1:25:11] mourning because love covers a multitude
[1:25:13] of
[1:25:15] sins amen so let's ask the question how
[1:25:18] do you feel when something terrible
[1:25:19] happens to
[1:25:21] somebody well they deserve that you
[1:25:23] repot your so all this nonsense no you
[1:25:25] should be genuinely
[1:25:27] grieved like David was for
[1:25:32] Saul amen he says here David could have
[1:25:35] rung his neck a few times speaking of
[1:25:37] Saul he could but he just let it go he
[1:25:40] never said nothing he sure could have
[1:25:42] done it he went over and cut off the
[1:25:43] tail of his coat one night came back and
[1:25:45] said look here you see yes sir he could
[1:25:47] have done it but he just let him alone
[1:25:50] he could have broke his congre up and
[1:25:52] Scattered them he started an
[1:25:53] organization of himself if he wanted to
[1:25:55] but he didn't do it he just let Saul go
[1:25:57] on let God do the fighting the pure in
[1:26:00] heart lets God take control of the
[1:26:04] situation cuz we going to
[1:26:07] realize we forget what Spirit we're of
[1:26:10] as uh brother Isaac put this up on
[1:26:12] Wednesday how how the disciples they
[1:26:14] weren't welcome into a certain Village
[1:26:16] so they asked Jesus should we call fire
[1:26:18] down from heaven like Elijah did they
[1:26:20] realized that the same anointing that
[1:26:22] was on Elijah was on them same anointing
[1:26:24] which is Christ right but they're asking
[1:26:26] can we use it this way like he did and
[1:26:29] Jesus said you don't know what manner of
[1:26:30] spirit you're of see the son of man has
[1:26:33] not come to destroy men's lives but to
[1:26:35] save them and they went to a and they
[1:26:38] went their way to another Village you
[1:26:39] see the son of man is revealed in the
[1:26:42] church now right he says you forget what
[1:26:45] manner of spirit are so when you get
[1:26:47] angry and Kindel and resentful against
[1:26:49] someone you forget what Spirit you're of
[1:26:51] when you hear something goes wrong to
[1:26:53] someone's life say they deserve it you
[1:26:55] forget what Spirit you're of we should
[1:26:56] never have malice or hatred or Envy or
[1:26:58] any kind of negative thought against
[1:27:02] anyone that's how we should be amen I'm
[1:27:05] going to I'm going to wrap this up with
[1:27:07] this
[1:27:08] now a boy a boy was a country boy he
[1:27:12] asked us you know he heard about this
[1:27:14] great God remember the pure in heart
[1:27:16] will see God right and so he ask his
[1:27:20] mama mama can any man see God he's so
[1:27:22] great she said ask the pastor
[1:27:24] how would you expect me to know well he
[1:27:26] went to the Pastor said pastor could any
[1:27:28] man see God said no son no no man can
[1:27:32] see God and live he went to a Sunday
[1:27:34] school teacher and said she said no no
[1:27:36] one can see God and live uh he loved
[1:27:38] nature there was an island just above us
[1:27:40] called a six mile island uh and old man
[1:27:44] fished up there just gone to Glory
[1:27:46] recently old white beard and white here
[1:27:48] one day the little boy had been with him
[1:27:50] up the river coming back down the river
[1:27:52] it it come a rain and the sun was going
[1:27:55] down in the west and causing a rainbow
[1:27:57] in the east as the old fisherman tipped
[1:28:00] along with his OES tipping the water is
[1:28:01] only a Boatman can appreciate nature and
[1:28:04] when he be to tip them like that the
[1:28:06] first thing you know making a noise as
[1:28:09] he tipped along like that he looked up
[1:28:11] all the leaves was washed off from the
[1:28:13] dust in the midsummer and seen the
[1:28:15] rainbow he he sat pulling again he
[1:28:18] stopped his Z he let them tip as the
[1:28:19] boat sailed along and after a while the
[1:28:22] little boy sitting in the stern of the
[1:28:23] boat noticed noted on the Old
[1:28:25] Fisherman's face tears rolling down his
[1:28:28] white beard the little boy got all
[1:28:30] excited run up to the middle of the boat
[1:28:31] fell down at the Old Fisherman's lap
[1:28:33] said sir I'm going to ask you a question
[1:28:35] my father could not answer my pastor
[1:28:37] could not answer my Sunday school could
[1:28:39] um could not answer my mother could not
[1:28:41] answer I said what's that Sunny if God's
[1:28:44] so great why can't we see him he just
[1:28:47] pulled the OES in his lap and commenced
[1:28:49] crying put his arm around the little lad
[1:28:50] said sunny all I've seen for the past 40
[1:28:53] years has been God see so much God in
[1:28:56] the old man's heart that he could see
[1:28:57] him everywhere he looked if you get him
[1:29:01] in here you can see him out there that's
[1:29:04] right he will use your eyes to look
[1:29:06] through you'll not see harms and dangers
[1:29:08] and faults and things you'll only see
[1:29:10] God whatever it is hallelujah why
[1:29:13] because the old man was pure in heart
[1:29:17] Hallelujah and so friends we just leave
[1:29:20] it with this if you're just seeing harms
[1:29:23] and dangers and faults
[1:29:25] what nature have you got what nature is
[1:29:27] living I say it's not the nature of the
[1:29:29] Lamb am mean because if you got the
[1:29:31] nature of the Lamb on the inside sure
[1:29:33] all the dangers and harms and faults are
[1:29:35] around you but you don't see them you
[1:29:36] see God and mean because the pure in
[1:29:38] heart shall see God Amen so we should
[1:29:41] never be caught up in those things if
[1:29:43] you're caught up in those things of life
[1:29:45] you you need to let God change your
[1:29:47] nature amen back to back to the nature
[1:29:50] of a lamb again amen because friends if
[1:29:53] we're If we're honest with ourselves we
[1:29:54] say Lord I want to see you I want to see
[1:29:57] you Lord I want to be pure in heart amen
[1:29:59] that Lord when you spoke the Beatitudes
[1:30:01] about the pure and heart shall see you I
[1:30:03] was on your mind when you spoke that
[1:30:04] word am me because you because you knew
[1:30:06] Lord that when you spoke that there'd be
[1:30:08] someone to fulfill that and you thought
[1:30:10] of me Lord that I'd be pure in heart
[1:30:12] that my heart would not be full of
[1:30:13] malice and jealousy and self ambition
[1:30:16] and pride and what I can get out of life
[1:30:18] and what you know how I can be seen
[1:30:20] among the Believers but Lord that my
[1:30:22] life would be pure that I just want to
[1:30:24] serve you whatever position I'm in
[1:30:26] whatever I'm called to do Lord I don't
[1:30:28] do it out of a selfish motive I don't do
[1:30:29] it out of a motive of trying to be
[1:30:31] looked at and seen and appreciated but
[1:30:33] Lord I want to do it as unto you Lord
[1:30:35] that my whole life is not unto me Lord
[1:30:38] it's not me living no more Lord It's you
[1:30:39] living in me Lord because I want to see
[1:30:41] you in my life I want to see your
[1:30:43] Supernatural hand I want to see your
[1:30:45] word fulfilled I want to see the power
[1:30:47] of God on you demonstrated Lord I want
[1:30:50] to see you I want to see your Plan of
[1:30:53] Redemption I want to see my part in your
[1:30:55] Plan of Redemption Lord I want to see
[1:30:57] you I don't want to see a selfish motive
[1:30:59] or a selfish ambition or some shady deal
[1:31:02] I pull over like some social justice
[1:31:05] Warrior or politician trying to lie for
[1:31:07] their cause I don't want to be like that
[1:31:08] Lord I want to be pure in heart ask you
[1:31:11] the question do you want to be that way
[1:31:12] this morning amen well then what is the
[1:31:16] solution for it just become a lamb
[1:31:20] again go back to that time when you
[1:31:23] first met made him yeah I mean go back
[1:31:26] to that time when the world seemed new
[1:31:29] that the sunrise seemed so much more
[1:31:31] better than Sunset so much more better
[1:31:33] rainbow just just the small things like
[1:31:35] there would have been plenty of rainbows
[1:31:37] you know there where fishing but that
[1:31:41] man had so much of God on the inside
[1:31:44] he's still God you know you think about
[1:31:46] rainbow that's God remembering his
[1:31:47] Covenant when that rainbow goes out
[1:31:49] maybe he started crying about that when
[1:31:51] he was roaring said Lord you put that
[1:31:53] bow in the Sky many years ago when you
[1:31:55] when you put it there for Noah and you
[1:31:57] put it there that you would remember
[1:31:59] your promise to man that you'll never
[1:32:00] flood the Earth again and Lord you've
[1:32:02] given us a greater Covenant than that
[1:32:04] about a flooding of an Earth but you
[1:32:06] gave us that Covenant that day on
[1:32:07] Calvary and I'm part of that Covenant so
[1:32:09] Lord when I see that rainbow I see that
[1:32:11] promise of Calvary I say thank you Lord
[1:32:13] I'm a beneficiary of that maybe he
[1:32:14] started crying because of that Lord and
[1:32:16] then as mine went back to when he first
[1:32:17] met God many many years ago why because
[1:32:20] his heart was soft and tender it wasn't
[1:32:23] callous with strife and envy like a wolf
[1:32:25] hardened it was soft I said friends
[1:32:29] let's go back there I want to go back
[1:32:31] there I don't want to have a wolf nature
[1:32:33] I don't want to be oh you say well
[1:32:34] there's all these burdens of life and
[1:32:36] things that should not change the nature
[1:32:38] that we are
[1:32:39] of right Jesus was a lamb in in front of
[1:32:44] the Sanhedrin he was a lamb on the Sea
[1:32:46] of Galilee he was a lamb serving his
[1:32:49] father as a carpenter he was a lamb on
[1:32:52] the mount Transfiguration he was a lamb
[1:32:53] here's a lamb in Hell amen here's a lamb
[1:32:56] everywhere heures a lamb resurrected
[1:32:59] Triumph it over hell death in the grave
[1:33:01] we can be the same way he went through
[1:33:03] far more but brother R makes a story he
[1:33:06] says about a man who um maybe we just
[1:33:08] had the musicians come but you know U
[1:33:11] brother B tells a story of uh of a um of
[1:33:15] a man and he's actually from South
[1:33:17] Africa and you know they were they were
[1:33:20] there and they were having a church
[1:33:21] split all this fussing and fighting had
[1:33:23] gone on and you know he was walking up
[1:33:25] the hill to walking up the hill to the
[1:33:27] church and then he heard a man walking
[1:33:29] behind him and this man was struggling
[1:33:32] you know walking like this and he had
[1:33:34] this big massive weight on the back of
[1:33:36] his back of his you on his back he's
[1:33:38] walking up this hill and he turns around
[1:33:41] this man sees him and and and he sees
[1:33:43] the man carrying the big weight and he
[1:33:45] re and and he sees nail scarred hands
[1:33:48] and he realizes he's in a vision and
[1:33:51] this man asks a question he says Lord
[1:33:54] are you carrying the sin of the world he
[1:33:56] says he says no I'm just carrying your
[1:33:58] sin up the
[1:33:59] hill it changed his
[1:34:01] life made him back a lamb again there's
[1:34:04] all this fussing fighting going on in
[1:34:06] the church but when he had that Vision
[1:34:07] he didn't care said Lord you're packing
[1:34:09] my sin up the hill Lord You're the one
[1:34:11] who's carrying me all the way Lord and
[1:34:13] he became a lamb again can't we do it
[1:34:15] friends can't we let God sweeten our
[1:34:19] Spirits once again I'm speaking about
[1:34:21] myself too Lord I don't want to be be
[1:34:23] critical and angry and frustrated and
[1:34:26] all these things Lord I want to be sweet
[1:34:28] forgiving understanding I want to be
[1:34:31] humble I want to be kind I want to turn

[1:34:38] thankfulness Lord for what you have done
[1:34:40] for me friends if you feel that way if
[1:34:42] you say Lord I don't remember the time
[1:34:45] of your sweetness anymore it seems like
[1:34:47] a very far thing away where where where
[1:34:49] there was that time where I could
[1:34:51] forgive I could let go
[1:34:54] I could say Lord not my will but thy
[1:34:56] will be done do you want to go back to
