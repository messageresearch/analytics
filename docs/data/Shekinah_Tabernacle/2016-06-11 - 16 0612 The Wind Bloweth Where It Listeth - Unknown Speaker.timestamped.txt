[53:50] blessing amen praise the Lord amen so
[53:54] John chapter 3 and we're just going to
[53:55] read verses uh 1 down to verse
[53:59] 8 and I know this is very familiar but
[54:03] it says
[54:05] now there was a man of the Pharisees
[54:08] named
[54:09] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[54:12] Jews amen we all
[54:16] there uh the same came to Jesus by night
[54:19] and said unto him Rabbi we know that
[54:21] thou art a teacher come from God for no
[54:23] man can do these miracles that thou Dost
[54:26] accept God be with him Jesus answered
[54:29] and said unto him verely verely I say
[54:31] unto thee except a man be born again he
[54:33] cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus
[54:35] saith unto him how can a man be born
[54:37] when he is old can he enter the second
[54:39] time into his mother's womb and be born
[54:42] Jesus answered verely verily I say unto
[54:44] thee except a man be born of water and
[54:46] of spirit he cannot enter into the
[54:48] kingdom of God that which is born of the
[54:51] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[54:53] the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I
[54:55] say unto thee ye must be born again the
[54:58] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[55:01] hearest the sound thereof but cannot
[55:03] canest not tell from whence it cometh
[55:05] and whether it goeth so is everyone that
[55:08] is born of the spirit amen let's just go
[55:12] to Genesis 1 and verse
[55:22] 1 it says here
[55:25] in the
[55:27] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[55:30] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[55:32] void and darkness was upon the face of
[55:34] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[55:36] upon the face of the waters amen you may
[55:39] be seated may the Lord bless his word
[55:43] now I want
[55:44] to I want to try and I know I've
[55:47] preached along these lines before but I
[55:50] want to uh speak about the you know the
[55:52] you know the wind you know the spirit
[55:54] moves through well will you know you
[55:56] cannot tell really where it comes from
[55:57] where it goes but after God blows into a
[56:00] place things are very different from
[56:02] when they first were amen and we can see
[56:04] this even in Genesis chapter 1 that you
[56:07] know it says the Earth was without form
[56:09] and void and darkness was upon the face
[56:11] of the deep but then when when when when
[56:13] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[56:15] the waters he had an intention and that
[56:17] was that you know that that there would
[56:19] be an Eden you know there'd be Adam
[56:21] there would be Eve and that would have
[56:23] dominion over the Earth that was his
[56:24] attention when he began to brood over
[56:26] the face of the Earth and we know he
[56:28] separated the light and the Darkness and
[56:29] he brought the land forth and he you
[56:31] know the seeds came forth and he created
[56:33] the animal life and everything then he
[56:34] put man in the garden and you know this
[56:37] was his this was this was God's desire
[56:40] is that his children would be there
[56:42] because God you know and it's the same
[56:44] with with with every believer before
[56:48] they meet God they're not satisfied with
[56:52] whatever life they may find themselves
[56:54] in there's something in them that is
[56:56] just not really satisfied they might
[56:58] tray all kinds of things they may go
[57:00] from church to church or they might just
[57:02] be in the world in some place but
[57:04] they're never truly happy there's just
[57:06] something in them that is just looking
[57:08] for something more I trust you you're
[57:11] that's been your experience and it's
[57:13] because there is you know as brother
[57:14] baram he would he would preach a sermon
[57:16] called The Deep calleth unto the deep
[57:18] and he would take that from the Psalms
[57:19] the Deep calleth unto the deep and he
[57:22] would say a very simple thing but a very
[57:24] powerful thing that if there's a deep in
[57:26] here that means there's a deep to
[57:28] respond and before there's a deep in
[57:30] here there was a deep out there amen so
[57:33] he said if you know if there's a longing
[57:35] in here for more of God there's more of
[57:37] God to have and the very reason you can
[57:39] actually one of the eviden is people say
[57:41] how do you know Jesus is real well we
[57:43] could go spend many times speaking of
[57:45] his Supernatural hand but you could say
[57:47] because there's a longing in here for
[57:49] God that means there's a God out there
[57:51] someplace that is there to be met amen
[57:53] because the Deep calleth the I mean the
[57:55] Deep calleth to the Deep amen so now God
[57:59] when he brooded over the face of the
[58:01] Earth he there was a deep calling in him
[58:04] that he didn't just want to be by
[58:05] himself with his thoughts and his
[58:07] attributes but he wanted to express them
[58:09] he wanted to have a people upon the
[58:11] Earth that he could make himself known
[58:12] to that he could have relationship with
[58:15] that he could share his heart's desires
[58:17] with and he could share the very deepest
[58:19] part of himself he would have a real
[58:21] love relationship with them and that's
[58:23] why he brooded over the face of the
[58:24] Waters amen
[58:26] hallelujah now brother Bram says and I'm
[58:30] just going to I trust this all goes
[58:32] together so in the identified Christ of
[58:35] all
[58:36] ages he says this in just as opening
[58:39] comments he says so this is before he
[58:42] reads the scripture he says I was
[58:43] thinking on the subject of what we're
[58:46] here
[58:47] for
[58:49] amen and then and then he then he goes
[58:51] and reads John chapter 10 and then he
[58:53] says you know I want to read uh you know
[58:55] an old familiar text Hebrews 138 but I
[58:58] was you know this really jumped out at
[59:00] me you know he was thinking on the
[59:01] subject of what we're here for and and
[59:03] some people remember we read in John 3
[59:06] that which is born of flesh is flesh
[59:08] it's natural but that which is born of
[59:10] the spirit of spirit it's very different
[59:12] kind of thing and then so now he was
[59:14] thinking along why are we here this he's
[59:16] thinking on this subject and he's about
[59:17] to preach a service the identified
[59:19] Christ of all ages and he's going to
[59:22] declare that same God that was back
[59:23] there as here right in the building I
[59:25] mean that same God that declared himself
[59:27] back there is here to declare himself to
[59:29] you and he's actually saying now the
[59:31] reason you're here is that there's a
[59:33] deep calling and he put it deep in you
[59:36] and then he came from eternities and
[59:37] revealed himself to you that he'd make
[59:39] himself known and you to enter into a
[59:41] relationship Hallelujah this message is
[59:44] not Doctrine only it's not just a form
[59:46] of religion or it's not a church it's
[59:49] God declaring himself through his word
[59:51] amen that he would make himself known
[59:53] he's a personal God amen I trust that
[59:56] you you know you know him you know if
[59:58] cuz if you know him that which is born
[1:00:00] of spirit is spirit amen if you've been
[1:00:03] born of God you're of God it's really
[1:00:05] that simple hallelujah hallelujah amen I
[1:00:08] I just trust you this if you know him oh
[1:00:11] you have all the frustrations of life
[1:00:13] and the ups and the downs and all these
[1:00:14] ins and outs but if you know him and
[1:00:17] mean remember he had an intention when
[1:00:19] he brw it over the Earth he didn't just
[1:00:20] do it because he because he thought I
[1:00:22] wonder what happens in his mind as I
[1:00:24] want my children there and I want to
[1:00:26] make myself known to them and then and
[1:00:28] then I'm going to jump down a few
[1:00:29] thousand years into this day where gross
[1:00:32] Darkness covers the people but he says
[1:00:34] that arise and shine for thy light has
[1:00:36] come and the glory of the Lord has risen
[1:00:38] upon you but he said Gross Darkness
[1:00:40] covers the people and I'll say you were
[1:00:42] born in that Darkness amen you were
[1:00:44] living in that darkness and you thought
[1:00:46] this was just how life was but then
[1:00:48] light began to shine he said let there
[1:00:50] be light and there was light amen and he
[1:00:53] opened your eyes I trust he has he's
[1:00:55] declared himself and he did that because
[1:00:57] he wants to know you not that you just
[1:01:00] have someone else's testimony I trust
[1:01:01] you have your own
[1:01:03] testimony I'm not this is not pie in the
[1:01:05] sky or whatever you want to some thing
[1:01:07] you cannot obtain Jesus comes to where
[1:01:09] you are remember that you don't have to
[1:01:12] climb to where he is he comes to you and
[1:01:14] it doesn't matter what depths of Despair
[1:01:16] or wherever you may be he comes to
[1:01:18] people like that he doesn't come to the
[1:01:21] people that are doing real well and they
[1:01:23] are you know overcoming all the time and
[1:01:26] no he doesn't come to just those people
[1:01:28] he comes to those who are wounded he
[1:01:30] comes to those who are broken he comes
[1:01:32] to those who are struggling Hallelujah
[1:01:34] he finds those people he finds the
[1:01:37] Wayward amen he comes down Adam and Eve
[1:01:39] were sure Wayward he was they had
[1:01:41] dominion over the Earth the very
[1:01:43] intention of God was that they would
[1:01:45] have dominion over the Earth and God
[1:01:47] would come down and speak to them and
[1:01:49] then they sure went Wayward but he came
[1:01:50] to them you Lord am mean he made himself
[1:01:53] real to them he came down they didn't
[1:01:55] know him as Redeemer said I'm going to
[1:01:56] show you what I what's really in me
[1:01:59] Hallelujah I'm going to I'm going to

[1:02:07] going to send the seed of the woman and
[1:02:09] and he's going to UND do everything the
[1:02:11] serpent just did it wasn't your fault
[1:02:13] Eve was deceived amen you're deceived
[1:02:16] you you were born this way you couldn't
[1:02:17] help it Hallelujah you just might as
[1:02:20] well come to the recognition I couldn't

[1:02:23] that's just your first first birth don't
[1:02:26] don't lean on your first birth lean on
[1:02:28] the second amen lean on the second of
[1:02:31] God has become real to you amen
[1:02:33] hallelujah lean on that birth that which
[1:02:35] is flesh is flesh but that which is
[1:02:37] spirit is Spirit hallelujah what does
[1:02:40] that mean if you have been born that
[1:02:42] which of spirit is spirit so if you have
[1:02:44] been born of God hello that means you're
[1:02:47] part of him thank you Lord
[1:02:50] hallelujah amen so don't lean on your
[1:02:53] first birth amen God comes to the
[1:02:55] waywood he says a he says a bruised re
[1:02:59] you know you know just just a re that's
[1:03:00] just not even smoking he won't quench
[1:03:03] the flame I mean a bruise really won't
[1:03:06] break and sometimes we come to places in
[1:03:09] in our walk where we think the fire's
[1:03:11] going down and we think how are we ever
[1:03:14] going to come out of this condition
[1:03:16] hallelujah thank you Lord but he says he
[1:03:18] won't he won't extinguish what's there
[1:03:21] am mean that life he puts in you he
[1:03:22] won't take away he won't kill it doesn't
[1:03:25] matter how much the devil tries to Snuff
[1:03:26] it out amen he'll he'll blow again amen
[1:03:30] he'll blow in the ambers and Flame will
[1:03:33] come again and he'll put a life on you
[1:03:35] to bring you standing right up remember
[1:03:37] it's not him that falls it's not him
[1:03:39] that comes under a strain amen him that
[1:03:42] gets back up again hallelujah amen we
[1:03:46] can live in Victory friends we have the
[1:03:49] victory ask not one day and maybe I'll
[1:03:51] get there you have it you possess what
[1:03:53] you need maybe sometimes you just need
[1:03:55] to lay aside your thinking and how you
[1:03:57] do things and try things a bit different
[1:04:00] Hallelujah isn't that true amen so he
[1:04:04] says I was thinking on the subject of
[1:04:06] why we're here
[1:04:09] now God has placed us upon the Earth he
[1:04:13] that he would know us personally amen
[1:04:15] hallelujah amen that's why we're here
[1:04:18] friends oh that you know that that the
[1:04:21] god from the the Eternal one will come
[1:04:23] down to your level that he would take
[1:04:25] you up to his level amen that's the very
[1:04:28] purpose of redemption is to raise up
[1:04:31] amen redeem that which was lost
[1:04:34] hallelujah amen and that's why we're
[1:04:37] here now God made man in his own image
[1:04:41] in Genesis chapter 1 as a spirit man man
[1:04:44] and woman and so in that in that Spirit
[1:04:47] man was a wood was a woman hidden in
[1:04:50] that man amen and then he put that then
[1:04:55] they put that Spirit man in a
[1:04:58] body and then he took then he took now
[1:05:02] the woman out of the man I know this is
[1:05:04] very Elementary but I just want to
[1:05:06] maybe uh just look at a bit different
[1:05:08] now Adam was by
[1:05:11] himself and Adam you know God saw Adam
[1:05:14] and he says it's not good that man
[1:05:15] should dwell alone and he was actually
[1:05:18] what he said about Adam he was actually
[1:05:20] speaking about himself it's not good
[1:05:21] that I'm alone I don't want to be alone
[1:05:24] amen oh then what do you mean how can
[1:05:26] God the Supreme Being that fills all
[1:05:28] time and space and made all things and
[1:05:30] you know how can he be alone he was
[1:05:33] alone but he didn't want to be alone he
[1:05:35] wanted to be a father he wanted to be a
[1:05:37] husband he wanted to be he wanted to
[1:05:39] someone that he could someone who was
[1:05:41] made in His image that he could actually
[1:05:44] know and they could know him amen
[1:05:48] hallelujah amen so now Adam Adam was
[1:05:51] there and then Eve was taken out of Adam
[1:05:54] now I just want I I just I pray the Lord
[1:05:57] help me just now if I put this in words
[1:05:59] just right but when now
[1:06:02] Adam yeah no this is just me but when
[1:06:04] Adam came back to him you know CU he put
[1:06:06] a deep sleep on Adam he took the rib out
[1:06:09] you know he took the feminist Spirit out
[1:06:10] of Adam made a body out of the rib and
[1:06:13] then put the you know feminist part of
[1:06:15] Adam into this into this body now when
[1:06:19] Adam woke up he would have
[1:06:21] felt pretty different to when God put
[1:06:24] him and it wasn't because he was missing
[1:06:26] a rib you know ribs are the only bones
[1:06:28] that can actually
[1:06:29] regrow amen that's why you know you
[1:06:32] count them and they say oh but men don't
[1:06:33] have one less rib well it's actually
[1:06:35] because ribs can
[1:06:36] regrow amen but then he would have felt
[1:06:40] different because the feminist part of
[1:06:41] himself wasn't in him anymore and he
[1:06:43] would have had now a deep
[1:06:46] calling and the only deep he could find
[1:06:50] was the
[1:06:51] woman amen because remember God has a
[1:06:54] deep longing for you amen that's why
[1:06:58] that's why he makes himself known is
[1:07:00] because there's something in him he says
[1:07:01] there's parts of
[1:07:03] me and I know where they are and I've
[1:07:06] been broing over them and then there
[1:07:09] comes a time when you begin to
[1:07:11] recognize I'm not from this place amen I
[1:07:14] Come From Another Place amen amen
[1:07:16] because there's a deep calling to the
[1:07:18] Deep amen So Adam because now remember
[1:07:21] you can take how God deals with us and
[1:07:24] you just bring it down to the husband
[1:07:25] and wife and there should be because
[1:07:27] there's a deep calling to the Deep amen
[1:07:30] yeah there's a deep in Adam and the only
[1:07:33] thing that could satisfy that deep was
[1:07:35] Eve because remember the Deep calling to
[1:07:39] the Deep it's actually that one thing
[1:07:42] just separated into two calling one to
[1:07:44] the other that's right hallelujah amen
[1:07:47] that's amen that's why that's why
[1:07:48] there's a longing for God in hiss
[1:07:50] because it's that part of you that came
[1:07:52] from the eternities that's calling back
[1:07:54] to the Eternal one so now there was
[1:07:57] there was the there was a deep calling
[1:07:59] to the
[1:08:00] deep and that's how God
[1:08:03] now and then that's why that's why when
[1:08:07] when when Adam came he named all the
[1:08:10] animals but he never said to any of the
[1:08:13] animals who came out of me he never said
[1:08:15] to any of them you know even like the
[1:08:18] chimpanze you know the chimpanzee he
[1:08:20] named the chimpanzee he named the he
[1:08:23] named The Serpent
[1:08:24] amen you know and even even the you
[1:08:28] know um where do I have it here this is
[1:08:33] from the Scientific American I'm just
[1:08:34] going to you know um I know I repeated
[1:08:37] the you I said this last last week but I
[1:08:39] was want to bring it out again so the
[1:08:42] chimpanzee they have 99% the same DNA as
[1:08:46] us yeah and the gorillas have
[1:08:51] 98% well and and they say well it's the
[1:08:55] 2% that is different that gives us the
[1:08:58] ability to walk you know on on just two
[1:09:01] Limbs and go to
[1:09:03] Mars no no no it's not that it's it's
[1:09:07] the soul that's in you cuz a chimpanzee
[1:09:11] you can go back you know you go back to
[1:09:13] Roman times the chimpanzees were doing
[1:09:15] the same things then as they do today
[1:09:18] but man is doing very different things
[1:09:19] today they were doing that then the
[1:09:21] Romans never went to the moon they
[1:09:23] didn't have nuclear weapons they didn't
[1:09:25] have they didn't have Facebook they
[1:09:27] didn't have all these things you know
[1:09:29] they didn't have Hallelujah I mean they
[1:09:31] didn't have all these all this
[1:09:33] technology they didn't have the ability
[1:09:35] for a man to stand in one place and His
[1:09:37] Image and his voice be beamed over the
[1:09:40] globe they didn't have those things but
[1:09:42] a chimpanzee was doing the same thing as
[1:09:44] he does today he was doing back then
[1:09:46] because there's a Sol in man amen
[1:09:49] there's there's a soul animals don't
[1:09:51] have a soul and God put that soul in you
[1:09:55] that there there' be a deep calling amen
[1:09:58] that's why we're different it's not
[1:09:59] because we got 2% different DNA it's
[1:10:02] because God put a soul in you hallelujah
[1:10:04] amen and that's the real you you know
[1:10:06] what you really are is it's not your
[1:10:08] body it's not your spirit it's your soul
[1:10:11] that's you that's the bit that's
[1:10:13] redeemed your spirit's not redeemed your
[1:10:16] your body's not redeemed yet it's your
[1:10:19] soul amen and he put a he put a calling
[1:10:23] in
[1:10:24] there and then now there's a deep
[1:10:26] calling to the
[1:10:27] Deep And So Adam now when he when he
[1:10:31] sees
[1:10:32] Eve he says now this is bone of my bone
[1:10:36] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[1:10:38] woman because she has taken out of man
[1:10:41] therefore shall man leave his father and
[1:10:43] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[1:10:44] and they shall be one
[1:10:46] flesh amen so he never said this to the
[1:10:49] serpent who was close enough like a man
[1:10:52] to mix with the man but he never said
[1:10:55] your bone of my bone he only said this
[1:10:57] to the woman and it's the same thing
[1:11:00] remember it wasn't Eve saying to Adam
[1:11:02] your bone of my bone I mean I'm I'm bone
[1:11:04] of your bone it was it was Adam saying
[1:11:06] your bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh
[1:11:08] so it was actually Adam declaring this
[1:11:11] is your part of me yeah and then now God
[1:11:14] comes down I'm just jumping from here
[1:11:16] just to now amen then then God comes and
[1:11:19] meets you whenever he met you in your
[1:11:21] life's journey and he begins to reveal
[1:11:24] himself to you and what is he actually
[1:11:26] saying he's saying your bone of my bone
[1:11:29] Flesh of My Flesh life of my life amen
[1:11:32] you're part of me you came out of me
[1:11:34] that's why he becomes real to you
[1:11:36] because he's telling you you came out of
[1:11:38] me hallelujah amen if that just sunk in
[1:11:42] a little bit down here I think the whole
[1:11:44] world would change I mean if you could
[1:11:46] just recognize that that you're part of
[1:11:49] him that's why there's a deep calling to
[1:11:50] the
[1:11:51] Deep Hallelujah
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:56] now the spirit blows where
[1:11:59] listeth now
[1:12:02] Adam God breathed into Adam's nostrils
[1:12:05] it says the breath of life and he became
[1:12:07] a living Soul so he started brooding
[1:12:10] over the Earth but then the end of his
[1:12:13] end of his creation as he he breathed
[1:12:16] God breathed into Adam and he became a
[1:12:18] living soul and then now that was the
[1:12:21] first I mean so that was the first Adam
[1:12:23] coming into into being and then now the
[1:12:25] second Adam who is God himself is there
[1:12:28] and in and in John chapter 20 he
[1:12:30] breathed on them his disciples after he
[1:12:32] rose he breathed on them and said
[1:12:35] receive ye the Holy Ghost and then so
[1:12:37] now the first creation finished with the
[1:12:40] Breath of God into his children and then
[1:12:43] now the beginning of the new
[1:12:46] creation amen because remember we are a
[1:12:49] new if if if you've been born if you've
[1:12:52] been birthed really birthed by the
[1:12:55] spirit of God you're a new creation all
[1:12:58] things pass away I mean old things pass
[1:13:00] away and All Things become new remember
[1:13:02] you're you're not a patched up person
[1:13:05] you're not someone with a big spiritual
[1:13:07] Band-Aid put on you you're been C you've
[1:13:09] been created again amen you have been
[1:13:12] birthed again you got to recognize this
[1:13:15] because the devil he brings up your past
[1:13:17] he brings up your old nature he brings
[1:13:19] up how you used to do things and you
[1:13:21] really got to look him in the face and
[1:13:23] say that's not me that guy's dead I can
[1:13:27] show you where he died Hallelujah here's
[1:13:30] his Tombstone that guy is dead I don't
[1:13:32] know who you're talking about he doesn't
[1:13:34] live here anymore there's a new person
[1:13:36] in this house thank you Lord you say
[1:13:39] that's a bit bold no it's not it is what
[1:13:41] it is if if the Apostle Paul could say
[1:13:45] such things I'm sure we can just Echo
[1:13:46] what he said because that was God
[1:13:49] writing through the Apostle Paul this is
[1:13:51] what I've done this is what I've done to
[1:13:53] you and then now God when he declares
[1:13:55] himself in this age this lady and church
[1:13:57] age that the world is in he says the
[1:14:00] author he says the beginning of the
[1:14:02] creation of God declaring his deity and
[1:14:06] that beginning is actually means the
[1:14:07] author of the new
[1:14:09] creation amen so he says here's and he's
[1:14:13] declaring himself he didn't declare
[1:14:15] himself like this in former ages but he
[1:14:16] says now in this age I'm declaring
[1:14:19] myself as the author of the new creation
[1:14:22] that's distinct from the past
[1:14:24] creation amen I trust this means a
[1:14:27] little bit to you amen and see so so
[1:14:29] here's here's God now coming into this
[1:14:31] evening hour and saying now I'm going to
[1:14:33] I'm going to make a new creation and
[1:14:36] where does he start that new creation he
[1:14:38] starts it in his people amen his
[1:14:40] creative power you know has has been
[1:14:43] spoken upon the Earth and that's why
[1:14:45] it's so it's so important this this
[1:14:48] message we've received you know it
[1:14:50] wasn't just God saying well I'm going to
[1:14:52] show what it's like for cre to happen or
[1:14:54] I'm going to show what it's like the you
[1:14:56] know he was showing now the words that
[1:14:58] came out of that Prophet messenger's
[1:15:00] mouth when he stood there and he's
[1:15:03] hunting and and and the anointing comes
[1:15:05] upon him and God ask him what do you
[1:15:07] need well I'm hunting squirrels and he's
[1:15:10] in a you know he's in a place and and
[1:15:12] there was a what Sycamore Thicket or
[1:15:14] something where squirrels never go and
[1:15:16] he says well how many do you want God
[1:15:18] asked him how many do you want I said
[1:15:19] well I want five or whatever it was and
[1:15:22] then and he says well let there be one
[1:15:23] on this branch and it just it was there
[1:15:25] and he shot it he and he's just like he
[1:15:28] can hardly believe what's going on he
[1:15:30] says well let the next one go down here
[1:15:31] up down here down here down here like
[1:15:33] this you know through through places
[1:15:35] scrs never go and there's a just there
[1:15:40] it then he shot it amen and then now his
[1:15:44] wife has got a Tuma the size of a
[1:15:46] grapefruit in her side and then he's
[1:15:49] praying she's going to have the
[1:15:51] operation she's being PR for surgery and
[1:15:54] that same Spirit comes upon him and
[1:15:56] basically says ask what you will and it
[1:15:58] shall be and he says he says before the
[1:16:00] surgeon touches her May that tumor
[1:16:03] disappear he was I don't know how big
[1:16:06] grapefruits like this just disappeared
[1:16:10] and then and then the surgeon was
[1:16:11] shocked what
[1:16:13] happened that was creative power amen
[1:16:16] and then when he spoke the storm out of
[1:16:18] existence in Colorado and you know gave
[1:16:20] the fish its life back and all you you
[1:16:22] the different cases had he write Sons
[1:16:25] receiving receiving eternal life it
[1:16:28] wasn't the prophet that that that
[1:16:29] actually activated that you just think
[1:16:32] about this for a second remember the
[1:16:33] same God oh that was back then the same
[1:16:36] God is here and the same power and the
[1:16:39] same ability and the same strength and
[1:16:41] the same Redemption you know we sung the
[1:16:43] song I'm just going on a tangent for a
[1:16:45] while we we've sung the song you know
[1:16:47] you know there's power in jesus' name
[1:16:49] and we have seen that power demonstrated
[1:16:52] cuz Jes Jesus means Jehovah savior
[1:16:54] Jehovah's salvation we' have seen real
[1:16:57] salvation we' have seen real Redemption
[1:16:59] we have seen the transforming power of
[1:17:01] God hallelujah we've seen wounds be
[1:17:04] healed not just physical but spiritual
[1:17:06] wounds amen we' have seen things the
[1:17:08] devil tries to destroy families and
[1:17:10] those families are still there
[1:17:13] hallelujah amen that is the power of
[1:17:16] jesus' name it's not just you know we've
[1:17:18] had you know I was just thinking sitting
[1:17:20] back there our first Camp you had you
[1:17:22] know sister Bethany Reed come along and
[1:17:25] in her heart was well if this is real
[1:17:26] God you better show yourself otherwise
[1:17:28] I'm just going to throw this message
[1:17:30] away amen she comes and she's never been
[1:17:32] the same cuz she's in the presence of
[1:17:35] almighty God hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:17:37] we have more like that come amen where
[1:17:39] the power of jesus' name has been
[1:17:41] demonstrated not just talked about
[1:17:43] demonstrated Hallelujah and he's the
[1:17:46] same today and then so brother brandham
[1:17:48] standing there telling the stories of
[1:17:50] the squirrels being created and here's a
[1:17:52] little woman brother Bram doesn't know
[1:17:54] it's going to happen but she something
[1:17:56] quickens in her heart that's true amen
[1:17:58] because she recognized what he said over
[1:18:00] the pulpit and God came and backed it up
[1:18:02] then it would be the same out of the
[1:18:04] pull pit and she recognized that's
[1:18:05] nothing but the truth brother brandham
[1:18:07] and that caused God to come down that
[1:18:09] caused God to give the salvation of the
[1:18:12] two boys who weren't even interested in
[1:18:14] God at the time amen she caused that to
[1:18:18] happen it wasn't brother bam it was her
[1:18:22] amen oh that's just a nice story no
[1:18:24] that's showing he's the same I'm
[1:18:27] contending this morning he's the same
[1:18:29] yesterday today and forever but the
[1:18:32] devil will come and say no he's not oh
[1:18:35] no he's not oh no you'll never have
[1:18:36] things like that happen to you how do
[1:18:38] you know right do you think this you
[1:18:41] think Satan wants you to believe he
[1:18:43] wants you to be discouraged he doesn't
[1:18:45] want you to be encouraged he doesn't
[1:18:47] want you to be rejoicing he doesn't want
[1:18:49] you to have be full of faith and feel
[1:18:51] like you can just go down to H yourself
[1:18:53] and kick him in the face he doesn't want
[1:18:55] you to feel like that amen that's why
[1:18:58] that's why he discourages you amen don't
[1:19:01] listen to shake off the discouragement
[1:19:03] amen amen how do you do that Paul says
[1:19:07] whatsoever things are good is his oh
[1:19:10] you're not a Christian today is that
[1:19:11] good no don't think about it whatsoever
[1:19:14] things are lovely oh you'll never get to
[1:19:16] make it to Heaven is that
[1:19:18] lovely no kick it out amen whatsoever
[1:19:21] things are pure any things he says are
[1:19:24] not
[1:19:25] pure amen I know this is you oh he comes
[1:19:30] along this is what he does amen amen
[1:19:32] don't think it's strange don't think
[1:19:35] it's strange when he comes to you and
[1:19:36] bombards you and says you're never going
[1:19:38] to make it and you think you're a
[1:19:39] Believer and you think you're going to
[1:19:41] you know Jesus G you know he came to
[1:19:44] Jesus in the desert if thou be in other
[1:19:47] words do you really think you're
[1:19:49] him he didn't clown he didn't form he
[1:19:53] just quoted the word amen and he did
[1:19:57] that to show that you can take the same
[1:19:58] scriptures because all those things
[1:20:00] Jesus said are in the Bible amen you
[1:20:03] know man shall not live by bread alone
[1:20:05] that's in
[1:20:06] Deuteronomy amen and you know all all
[1:20:08] those are scriptures that he quoted so
[1:20:10] he just he just took the Bible but he is
[1:20:14] being the word so he didn't need to do
[1:20:15] that and he just opened you you know he
[1:20:17] didn't need to say I think it says this
[1:20:18] and he read it and says here devil it
[1:20:19] says this here amen and he did to show
[1:20:23] you can take the same word and say the
[1:20:26] same things and you'll get the same
[1:20:28] results what is the result and the devil
[1:20:30] left him
[1:20:32] hallelujah amen so now these things the
[1:20:37] creative power was demonstrated to show
[1:20:40] now remember I'm speaking he's the
[1:20:41] beginning of the creation of God so it
[1:20:44] wasn't brother Bram it was God coming
[1:20:45] down into a prophet speaking words and
[1:20:49] those words have creative power now it
[1:20:52] doesn't matter what other people have
[1:20:53] made of the message I just take what he
[1:20:56] says and believe it for what it is and
[1:20:58] then you'll get the results for what it
[1:21:00] was intended to do amen amen hey the
[1:21:03] Catholics have made Jesus and Mary and
[1:21:05] Joseph and all kinds of things they've
[1:21:07] made they've made most of what we love
[1:21:09] and adore into into into all kinds of
[1:21:12] things it doesn't mean we throw away
[1:21:14] Jesus Mary Joseph and whatever that's
[1:21:17] right it doesn't mean we throw the
[1:21:18] communion out doesn't mean we throw you
[1:21:20] know having church out because of what
[1:21:22] they made it amen and then if you just
[1:21:25] bring it way closer to home just because
[1:21:27] people quote the message and they quote
[1:21:30] different things and they it doesn't
[1:21:31] mean you throw it
[1:21:33] out amen you just got to believe it for
[1:21:35] what it is you know don't worry about
[1:21:38] what they say God what did you say
[1:21:41] because you have to have confidence if
[1:21:43] you've got the holy ghost that spirit
[1:21:45] will lead
[1:21:46] you and just because someone else says
[1:21:49] it it doesn't necessarily make it's
[1:21:51] wrong but if it's not real to you just
[1:21:53] keep walking and say well Lord if it's
[1:21:55] if it's you I'll just keep walking and
[1:21:57] and then and then when you want to show
[1:21:59] me you'll show
[1:22:00] me amen is this all right don't but but
[1:22:04] but don't pull the other way cuz there's
[1:22:06] two ditches on the side of the road and
[1:22:08] both are just as bad that's right and
[1:22:11] you don't want to start you know because
[1:22:13] people they find themselves in a ditch
[1:22:15] but then they think they're doing real
[1:22:17] well and then they put in sandbags then
[1:22:19] they concrete out and they dig the ditch
[1:22:21] a little bit deeper they make a trench
[1:22:23] then they have their weapons and they
[1:22:25] put gun imp placements that's what
[1:22:27] people do us for no more
[1:22:30] amen it's true this is what it is are
[1:22:34] you
[1:22:35] sure amen keep walking with God whatever
[1:22:39] you do just because someone else says
[1:22:41] something you know how does now I was
[1:22:44] thinking about this how how do complexes
[1:22:48] form okay sometimes okay complexes they
[1:22:52] all start with someone or something
[1:22:55] doing something to you that is bad or
[1:22:58] impacts you badly and then that turns
[1:23:01] into
[1:23:03] resentment yeah you resent that and you
[1:23:06] don't forgive them and that forms a
[1:23:09] complex you can see in brother bram's
[1:23:11] life when he said after the opening of
[1:23:13] the seals um you know he got a complex
[1:23:17] that he lost his love for the people how
[1:23:20] did that begin because they were
[1:23:23] rejecting what was being said and he
[1:23:26] began to resent
[1:23:27] it amen and he resented it he didn't
[1:23:32] forgive them amen and then he formed
[1:23:36] that
[1:23:37] complex amen and it all happened because
[1:23:41] he
[1:23:42] didn't it's perfectly human to resent
[1:23:44] something you just subconsciously
[1:23:46] sometimes you just do it but then now
[1:23:48] what do you do after that see if you do
[1:23:50] not forgive remember if you forgive
[1:23:54] someone it actually releases whatever's
[1:23:57] holding you
[1:23:59] back amen you it says in Hebrews do not
[1:24:03] let a root of bitterness grow into you
[1:24:05] well how does a root of bitterness come
[1:24:07] there's a resentment then there's some
[1:24:09] unforgiveness amen and then it forms
[1:24:11] into a complex what what what's
[1:24:13] happening now our root is starting to
[1:24:15] grow amen and it doesn't 100% of the
[1:24:19] time it doesn't affect the other person
[1:24:21] it affects the person that's got the
[1:24:23] root amen and then they start living
[1:24:26] life according to that root of
[1:24:28] bitterness or whatever complex is there
[1:24:30] look brother braham's whole life was now
[1:24:32] changed because of a complex I want to
[1:24:34] go be up in the Northern British
[1:24:36] Columbia I want to be a hunter like I've
[1:24:38] always wanted to be you know and then
[1:24:40] when God gives me a word I'll stomp out
[1:24:42] like an Old Testament Prophet say thus
[1:24:44] sayith the Lord and go back why all
[1:24:46] because the people were resenting what
[1:24:48] he said amen and it formed a complex
[1:24:53] Hallelujah and that's why but what
[1:24:55] happened he didn't forgive them Jesus on
[1:24:58] the cross father forgive them they don't
[1:25:00] know what they
[1:25:02] do and I think I've said it before Oh I
[1:25:05] have they planned
[1:25:07] it they actually it says in the Bible
[1:25:09] they actually had meetings how can we
[1:25:10] destroy him that's right they planned it
[1:25:14] they knew what they were doing we know
[1:25:16] th are a teacher come from God but we're
[1:25:18] going to crucify
[1:25:20] you amen
[1:25:23] but Jesus recognized like the words of
[1:25:25] the Apostle Paul if they really knew
[1:25:27] that he was the Prince of Life they
[1:25:29] would never have crucified him amen but
[1:25:32] he could say father forgive them they
[1:25:33] don't know what they do amen you're fine
[1:25:37] 100% the time it'll be a resentment that
[1:25:41] forms into a complex and if you're not
[1:25:44] careful then that just grows into a root
[1:25:46] of bitterness and it sayso not let a
[1:25:48] root of bitterness come into you because
[1:25:50] many are defiled because of it it amen
[1:25:54] so you have to have the ability from
[1:25:56] your heart oh they but but but brother
[1:25:58] Ben they have never asked for
[1:26:00] forgiveness it doesn't matter right amen
[1:26:03] Jesus wasn't hang there saying do you
[1:26:05] want to um ask for
[1:26:08] forgiveness he just said father forgive
[1:26:10] them I know it sounds ridiculous but
[1:26:12] that's what that's that's how we we're
[1:26:14] on a cross and see many times we are
[1:26:16] made fun of and we're ridiculed unjustly
[1:26:20] he had no right to be there they should
[1:26:22] have they should have lifted him up amen
[1:26:26] here's the king of glory they had to do
[1:26:28] it because we had to come in you
[1:26:30] understand oh what manner of love is
[1:26:32] this amen amen but you see we we
[1:26:36] sometimes there on a cross and and we
[1:26:38] think this is
[1:26:40] wrong you know you should ask me to
[1:26:43] forgive you you've done me wrong oh I'm
[1:26:46] not going to forgive you because you
[1:26:47] never asked for it it doesn't matter
[1:26:50] doesn't matter if they never come and
[1:26:51] acknowledge they're wrong it's you and
[1:26:54] God Amen and you can't help someone if
[1:26:58] you have resentment towards them how
[1:27:01] does how does brotherly love love
[1:27:03] between the Brethren go away the Devil
[1:27:06] comes in shoot someone with something
[1:27:08] and how does it normally start a
[1:27:11] misunderstanding and then oh then the
[1:27:13] rose tinted glass go on and they always
[1:27:15] do something wrong
[1:27:18] amen
[1:27:20] hello amen and and it but it always
[1:27:23] starts with a misunderstanding and it
[1:27:25] can be the most smallest thing right
[1:27:28] amen or what if it's a massive thing
[1:27:30] what if it's a life-changing thing you
[1:27:32] still have to forgive them it doesn't
[1:27:34] mean they're in the right but you have
[1:27:36] to be able to actually because that how
[1:27:38] do you let go of pain
[1:27:41] forgiveness how do you let go of hurts
[1:27:43] you forgive because when you forgive it
[1:27:46] releases it you're not actually holding
[1:27:48] it because the devil you know puts it
[1:27:51] down your throat wrote he says look at
[1:27:53] what they've done and look at what it's
[1:27:54] caused you and look at all the pain that
[1:27:56] may be true I'm not you know the the one
[1:28:00] who does the damage I'm not saying
[1:28:02] they're all squeaky clean but I'm
[1:28:05] talking about you yeah amen because
[1:28:07] remember Jesus said don't try and take
[1:28:10] the toothpick or whatever out of your
[1:28:12] brother's eye say Lord take the beam out
[1:28:14] of my eye and then when the beams out
[1:28:16] then you can help your brother amen and
[1:28:19] it's the same remember if something's in
[1:28:21] my eye my vision is clouded I can't see
[1:28:24] like I should and it's the same thing
[1:28:26] now if I have a complex in me I can't
[1:28:28] see or walk like I
[1:28:31] should
[1:28:33] amen and then well then how do I get rid
[1:28:35] of it you have to
[1:28:37] forgive you have to you know you
[1:28:39] actually from your heart forgive that
[1:28:40] person they didn't know what they
[1:28:43] do
[1:28:45] amen amen and so if you do that because
[1:28:48] it says here let's go to let's go to um
[1:28:52] Psalms chapter
[1:28:56] 1 he says this here remember the wind
[1:28:59] blow blows in amen maybe we yeah maybe
[1:29:03] I'll just say this the spirit of God
[1:29:05] Moves In in particular seasons yep and
[1:29:09] there will be a Revival Believers will
[1:29:11] come
[1:29:12] in and then sometimes the wind stops
[1:29:15] blowing there's a season where God
[1:29:17] gathers his children and it doesn't just
[1:29:19] happen one time but there's just a big
[1:29:22] move of the spirit through a community
[1:29:24] and people come in and then there comes
[1:29:27] a season where it doesn't seem to be
[1:29:28] happening again and then the wind will
[1:29:29] blow again remember there's Seasons
[1:29:32] where God does things and then so now
[1:29:35] you'd say well you could actually say
[1:29:37] the wind has blown here amen I'm talking
[1:29:40] about a spiritual wind we know the
[1:29:41] natural wind always blows but there's a
[1:29:43] there's a supernatural wind blowing
[1:29:45] through this place amen and now we're
[1:29:48] here but then now we want to we want to
[1:29:52] walk in such a way that we continue in
[1:29:55] the faith amen because I believe the
[1:29:59] wind's going to blow again Hallelujah
[1:30:00] that's my heart's desire it's not us for
[1:30:03] no more it's us for and everyone else
[1:30:05] will come it's it's I want to you know I
[1:30:09] want to go on a Rapture who wants to go
[1:30:10] on a
[1:30:11] Rapture we're here until the last one
[1:30:14] comes in oh that's on some foreign soil
[1:30:17] someplace who says it's not next door
[1:30:20] because the mission field is definitely
[1:30:22] to New Zealand amen am mean not just on
[1:30:24] the plane but this this country needs a
[1:30:27] lot more missionaries than Africa does
[1:30:29] amen amen then you look at Australia it
[1:30:32] needs a lot more than we
[1:30:34] do amen
[1:30:37] now blessed is the man now we're in
[1:30:39] sorry Psalms 1 and one blessed is the
[1:30:42] man that walketh not in the counsil of
[1:30:44] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:30:47] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:30:50] scornful well how do you you how do you
[1:30:52] find yourself in that place you resent
[1:30:55] something amen I just want to keep going
[1:30:58] down this road because you got to
[1:31:00] understand why do I you may have an ill
[1:31:02] feeling against someone why do I have
[1:31:04] that ill feeling because something they
[1:31:06] did in their Humanity you
[1:31:09] resented amen and they may just continue
[1:31:12] and walk on like nothing ever happened
[1:31:15] amen but then you're still sitting with
[1:31:17] the baggage you're still sitting with
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:19] bomb amen
[1:31:22] and now you're the one pinned down by
[1:31:24] this thing why is that because he says
[1:31:27] blessed is the man that doesn't sit in
[1:31:30] the seat of the
[1:31:32] scornful yeah so you're blessed if you
[1:31:35] do not sit in remember we're
[1:31:39] human now I'm just going to talk about
[1:31:42] just misunderstandings there's been a
[1:31:43] lot worse things happen among Believers
[1:31:45] than just a misunder understanding but
[1:31:47] we're human and iron sharpens iron amen
[1:31:51] amen so our
[1:31:53] Humanity God makes us in such a way and
[1:31:57] he makes polar opposite uh what do you
[1:32:00] call it personalities and he brings them
[1:32:03] into a fellowship hallelujah amen
[1:32:06] because there's got to be a a
[1:32:08] sharpening
[1:32:10] hallelujah amen and whether you like it
[1:32:12] or not you should say thank
[1:32:15] God Amen and you should never you should
[1:32:19] never say well is that person bright or
[1:32:21] is this person what are they that's up
[1:32:22] to God don't waste these top two inches
[1:32:26] with thinking about as this person in or
[1:32:28] this person in don't worry about them
[1:32:31] worry about your own household worry
[1:32:33] about yourself first amen that is that
[1:32:36] is the most important thing amen and
[1:32:39] then worry about them but pray for them
[1:32:41] don't say well are they in or they out
[1:32:43] look at them I don't know just pray for
[1:32:45] them amen because they may be living
[1:32:48] under a
[1:32:50] facade amen
[1:32:52] they may appear one thing but be another
[1:32:54] thing deep down but deep down they want
[1:32:56] to be the real
[1:32:58] deal amen but by but by res you know but
[1:33:02] by saying are they in and out just say
[1:33:05] well I don't
[1:33:06] know it doesn't matter
[1:33:08] really
[1:33:10] amen Jesus even called Judas
[1:33:14] friend yeah he called Judas this was a
[1:33:17] son of predition Amen brother Braham
[1:33:20] speaks about there Adam and there was
[1:33:22] the serpent in the garden he said there
[1:33:25] are the two
[1:33:26] trees I mean sorry there was Christ and
[1:33:28] you know and and and the devil and then
[1:33:31] then then came down all the way down
[1:33:33] through the two grew all the way down
[1:33:35] through then there's
[1:33:36] Jesus who was God's Masterpiece the
[1:33:39] second Adam and then there was Judas
[1:33:43] which was the devil's
[1:33:45] Masterpiece amen you can see it all the
[1:33:47] way down you know all there's a True
[1:33:48] Vine false Vine all the way down through
[1:33:51] and Jesus knew that Judas was going to
[1:33:54] betray him he says he you know he called
[1:33:57] him friend Jesus didn't say one thing
[1:33:59] and think another
[1:34:01] thing amen he genuinely considered him a
[1:34:05] friend but he knew that he was going to
[1:34:08] betray him and he knew he was going to
[1:34:10] his going to go to his place and Jesus
[1:34:12] knew I came from God and I go back to
[1:34:15] God
[1:34:16] Amen and but Jesus treated because
[1:34:19] remember Jesus you know they're sitting
[1:34:21] there at the Last Supper that means they
[1:34:23] had suppers before that and then he says
[1:34:26] one of you is going to betray me and
[1:34:28] then they're all shocked who is it Lord
[1:34:31] they didn't
[1:34:32] know why is that okay I think part of it
[1:34:35] is because Jesus treated them all the
[1:34:38] same and apparently I think brother
[1:34:40] Billy Paul said this I might be wrong he
[1:34:42] said brother bradam treated his enemies
[1:34:45] and his friends the same way you
[1:34:48] couldn't tell who is his enemy and who
[1:34:50] is his friend by how he spoke about
[1:34:53] people
[1:34:55] hallelujah
[1:34:57] amen so if if if that was the second
[1:35:01] Adam if that was our example Jesus
[1:35:03] Christ calling judah's friend and then
[1:35:06] he took a redeemed son and that was how
[1:35:09] a redeemed son that came to his position
[1:35:11] treated everyone how much should we
[1:35:14] follow that
[1:35:15] example amen how much should we follow
[1:35:18] that example and so we should follow
[1:35:21] that example that it doesn't matter
[1:35:24] where those people end up we should
[1:35:25] treat them the same way with the same
[1:35:28] love and respect and
[1:35:30] concern amen because what if we resent
[1:35:33] that person then the next thing you know
[1:35:36] you begin to talk badly to other people
[1:35:39] about that
[1:35:40] person and this is what the devil wants
[1:35:43] to do it's just you know you you know
[1:35:44] the prophet says it comes in so
[1:35:47] easily amen and then you talk
[1:35:49] badly to these people and then they talk
[1:35:52] to that person then this person talks
[1:35:54] and the next thing you know everyone
[1:35:56] sitting in the same building singing the
[1:35:59] same songs listening to the same word
[1:36:01] but they don't trust each other yeah I
[1:36:03] mean they won't have nothing to do with
[1:36:05] the other person but there's meant to be
[1:36:07] a unity and love between the
[1:36:10] Brethren
[1:36:12] amen and this is important because if
[1:36:15] there's disunity then God can't have his
[1:36:18] way am amen and God can't do what he
[1:36:22] wants to
[1:36:23] do amen we want God to have his way
[1:36:27] Hallelujah that's why it says you know
[1:36:30] doesn't sit in the seat of the
[1:36:32] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:36:35] of the Lord which is his word we know
[1:36:37] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:36:40] night that's why Paul said whatsoever
[1:36:42] things are good pure lovely think on
[1:36:44] those things are true you know you and
[1:36:47] he shall be like a tree amen planted by
[1:36:51] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:36:54] his fruit in his season his Leaf also
[1:36:58] shall not wither and whatever he doeth
[1:37:01] shall
[1:37:02] prosper so this is what a person's like
[1:37:05] who does not stand in the way of Sinners
[1:37:08] pardon me or sth in the seat of the
[1:37:11] scornful they'll be planted by the one
[1:37:14] River of many Waters speaking of the
[1:37:16] Waters of the spirit now amen and his
[1:37:20] Leaf won
[1:37:21] he'll bear his fruit in his season amen
[1:37:24] and the Lord shall prosper I mean his Le
[1:37:29] and what whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:37:32] prosper
[1:37:35] now we are living in a season where
[1:37:38] there's a people who are exactly like
[1:37:40] this
[1:37:43] amen because you see some
[1:37:46] people and you come in their presence
[1:37:49] and you spend time with them you feel so
[1:37:50] refreshed
[1:37:52] Fred why is that because you've come
[1:37:54] under their shade
[1:37:56] tree amen you've come under their shade
[1:37:59] and you're taking a
[1:38:01] rest Amen brother B speaks of the
[1:38:03] restoration of the Bride tree and he and
[1:38:04] he takes this scripture amen he says he
[1:38:07] says there's there's real Fellowship I
[1:38:10] mean you're not all worn out and
[1:38:11] stressed because you've been with them
[1:38:13] but you feel
[1:38:14] relaxed amen but then you can talk to
[1:38:17] the same I mean another person and they
[1:38:20] may believe exactly the the same thing
[1:38:22] they may say exactly the same thing and
[1:38:24] do the same kind of thing but you don't
[1:38:26] feel that
[1:38:27] refreshment why is that maybe the other
[1:38:29] one's a bit withered
[1:38:31] up amen and the other one's
[1:38:35] not so we don't want to come and but I
[1:38:38] say if you're all withered up you don't
[1:38:41] have to stay withered up amen you don't
[1:38:45] how do I get unwithered get off the seat
[1:38:47] of the
[1:38:48] scornful amen don't stand in the way of
[1:38:50] sin just if they don't accept it just
[1:38:52] let them go on Amen but but get off that
[1:38:55] seat and then you'll see then you'll see
[1:38:58] the leaves start to come back again amen
[1:39:01] hallelujah then the fruit will come in
[1:39:03] its
[1:39:05] season
[1:39:06] now what's time okay so
[1:39:10] now this is what we call and so when the
[1:39:13] spirit when the wind moves this is what
[1:39:16] it
[1:39:17] produces amen and brother Braham also
[1:39:20] says it's like a tree when when the wind
[1:39:23] comes in and really shakes the tree then
[1:39:25] the then the roots can get a bit deeper
[1:39:27] into the Earth and it can grip down into
[1:39:29] the soil deeper he the same thing with
[1:39:31] the believer when the Winds of
[1:39:32] persecution come and hardship comes and
[1:39:35] Trials come they blow in it may shake
[1:39:38] the tree but it just causes your roots
[1:39:40] to go down deeper onto the Rock of
[1:39:42] Ages
[1:39:44] hallelujah amen but the secret is when
[1:39:47] the hardship come you know it's always
[1:39:49] people you love the most hurt you the
[1:39:51] the
[1:39:51] most amen so it's people that you even
[1:39:55] may look up to yeah I'm you I'm just
[1:39:58] talking family hurts you the most but
[1:40:01] people in church that you respect and
[1:40:03] look up to the most they will hurt you
[1:40:05] the most amen and it's normally hardship
[1:40:09] hardship when hardship comes from that
[1:40:11] way that's when it shakes a tree the
[1:40:13] most yeah amen I just want you to think
[1:40:17] about these things because we don't want
[1:40:19] to sit in the seat of the scornful amen
[1:40:21] we don't want to be bowed down by
[1:40:23] hardship and all these things we don't
[1:40:24] want to hold bitterness against our you
[1:40:26] know against our fellow believer we
[1:40:28] don't want to hold resentment and we
[1:40:31] don't want to
[1:40:32] because normally if people justify their
[1:40:36] actions and they do things bad it's
[1:40:37] because there's a root of bitterness or
[1:40:39] something in them that they need to just
[1:40:41] actually forgive someone and just let it
[1:40:43] go because remember if it's in there
[1:40:45] it'll affect everyone badly not just the
[1:40:47] person who caused it to happen amen
[1:40:51] amen so now the wind
[1:40:55] blows and God God has come down in this
[1:40:59] evening hour in such a way that he wants
[1:41:01] us to be trees planted by the river of
[1:41:04] waters amen he said he's called he
[1:41:07] called it the restoration of the Bride
[1:41:09] tree and he speaks you know he speaks
[1:41:12] about how that tree that fruit tree that
[1:41:15] he planted there you know in the book of
[1:41:17] Acts was chewed down into a little stump
[1:41:20] you know and then and then after the
[1:41:21] Dark Ages you know it begins to grow
[1:41:23] again and he says now in this end time
[1:41:26] it's growing back into its fullness you
[1:41:27] should go listen to the sermon and then
[1:41:29] he speaks about ezekiel's dry bones and
[1:41:33] he says about how how how the you know
[1:41:35] the bones came back together there's
[1:41:37] like four stages of the restoration of
[1:41:40] that great Army and the last one is that
[1:41:42] when when when God says to Ezekiel son
[1:41:45] of man prophesy and he prophesied then
[1:41:48] the wind be to blow amen and life went
[1:41:51] into them and they stood up as a great
[1:41:53] Army and he says I wish I had time he
[1:41:56] says prophesy son of man and so he's
[1:41:58] actually his I
[1:42:01] trust there himself in that position
[1:42:05] amen when the last stage of the
[1:42:07] restoration is when the son of man
[1:42:09] prophesies and the wind blows and life
[1:42:12] goes into them and they stand up like a
[1:42:14] mighty Army Hallelujah and here we are
[1:42:19] you've come under the sound of that
[1:42:20] Ministry
[1:42:22] amen you've come under the sound of you
[1:42:24] know the the transforming creative power
[1:42:26] of God because there Creation in his
[1:42:29] word I trust this is not over your heads
[1:42:31] amen because you say well how's your
[1:42:33] creative power go back to your life
[1:42:35] before you heard it and then bring your
[1:42:38] life to where you are and you can see
[1:42:40] the things you used to do there's
[1:42:42] nothing in you that wants them and the
[1:42:44] thoughts you used to think you don't
[1:42:45] think them anymore and the nature you
[1:42:47] even had then you don't have now why
[1:42:50] you've been created over again
[1:42:52] Hallelujah all because you've heard a a
[1:42:55] voice amen and you haven't resisted The
[1:42:57] Voice you say yes Lord mold me and shape
[1:42:59] me I give my life to The Potter's hands
[1:43:02] amen and then so he says so now the wind
[1:43:05] blow this is so the wind is
[1:43:07] blowing
[1:43:09] amen and the and the purpose maybe I'll
[1:43:12] just kind of try and wind it up but the
[1:43:14] purpose of him speaking this word over
[1:43:16] the Earth is to bring you
[1:43:19] forth
[1:43:21] amen so the wind is blown you don't know
[1:43:24] where it came from exactly it came from
[1:43:26] heaven but then it then it blows through
[1:43:28] and then everyone who is born of the
[1:43:31] spirit is the same
[1:43:33] likewise amen where a Revival comes God
[1:43:37] has blown friends amen he has he has
[1:43:41] come amen not just I'm not just talking
[1:43:44] about here it's all over the earth I
[1:43:46] mean brother Tim DoD said when they had
[1:43:48] a Revival there in the universities and
[1:43:50] things they had 150 Souls come in from
[1:43:53] without and within they had a Revival
[1:43:55] but now he says it's over but but you
[1:43:59] know those things have happened before
[1:44:01] there in the past amen and then so God
[1:44:04] blows and then he cses people to come in
[1:44:07] and then he establishes them in the
[1:44:09] present truth I trust you can say that's
[1:44:11] been me amen and then the wind blows and
[1:44:13] then that happens and then now we're
[1:44:16] waiting that the wind is going to blow
[1:44:18] again amen and it's part of our
[1:44:23] expectation amen it's part of our
[1:44:25] expectation you know he says in this
[1:44:27] sermon that I quoted from in the very
[1:44:30] beginning um Christ identified in all
[1:44:35] ages he says
[1:44:39] this he says there's something in US
[1:44:42] reaches out for something that we know
[1:44:46] we come from
[1:44:48] somewhere amen so before you meet the
[1:44:51] Lord there's something in you just
[1:44:52] reaching
[1:44:53] out but then you meet him he becomes a
[1:44:57] living reality he's more real than me
[1:44:59] standing hereen amen he is a person and
[1:45:02] you must meet that person it's not
[1:45:04] mentally agreeing with some Doctrine you
[1:45:06] got to meet him exactly amen and he and
[1:45:09] he's
[1:45:10] present amen and there something
[1:45:13] something in us that just reaches out
[1:45:15] and I remember before I met God I I
[1:45:18] wasn't satisfied with the part culture I
[1:45:21] wasn't satisfied with University life I
[1:45:24] wasn't satisfied with with movies or
[1:45:26] music or sport there's just something in
[1:45:29] me that just wasn't satisfied cuz
[1:45:30] something was reaching
[1:45:32] out Hallelujah but then I heard this
[1:45:34] word hallelujah and then he became real
[1:45:37] I had to give myself to it but he became
[1:45:40] real and then when he became real
[1:45:42] something still reaches
[1:45:43] out amen but it's not for where are you
[1:45:47] it's Lord I want to I want more of you
[1:45:50] Hallelujah I trust that's your you know
[1:45:54] don't let the devil just think this is
[1:45:56] how life is and this is how church
[1:45:57] should be and now we're all got
[1:45:59] comfortable and that is not don't listen
[1:46:02] to that
[1:46:03] lie amen God is a god of
[1:46:06] Supernatural and he can do more than we
[1:46:09] can even imagine Hallelujah but what we
[1:46:11] need to do is just let ourselves go
[1:46:14] don't try and hold yourself back you
[1:46:16] know sometimes we well I need to be uh
[1:46:19] you know respectable and I need to
[1:46:21] behave and you know just let yourself
[1:46:24] go amen are with me amen because
[1:46:28] sometimes we actually you have to yield
[1:46:30] yourself and then whatever he wants to
[1:46:33] do just let him do it oh that can be out
[1:46:35] of order if God's doing it it's never
[1:46:37] out of
[1:46:38] order
[1:46:40] Hallelujah and so to me now there's
[1:46:42] something in me I'm not satisfied with
[1:46:44] the services we have and I trust you to
[1:46:47] say Amen hey they're wonderful but I'm
[1:46:49] not satisfied if IED with with with this
[1:46:53] amen and it's not that we need to find
[1:46:54] something greater we have the word we
[1:46:57] have the we have Jesus Christ he's found
[1:46:59] us he's gathered us but I want to see
[1:47:02] more than just words come out of her
[1:47:04] mouth and songs that are sung I want to
[1:47:06] see God live in a greater way I'm not
[1:47:08] saying he's not living we need to find
[1:47:10] him we he found us amen but but I want
[1:47:13] more I want the wind to blow again amen
[1:47:17] that we don't just you know I was so

[1:47:20] restoration of the brid tree and then
[1:47:22] they have a I think they have a prayer
[1:47:23] line or there's discernment and God just
[1:47:25] comes down and then you just hear all
[1:47:27] the people screaming and shouting and
[1:47:29] rejoicing and I was so moved I I was
[1:47:31] crying I said Lord we've had times like
[1:47:34] that I said Lord that's what I I want to
[1:47:37] see I don't just want services and we

[1:47:46] just got next to themselves and just
[1:47:48] worshiped how they wanted to worship and
[1:47:50] it wasn't just a bunch of noise God did
[1:47:52] things and that's what I want to see
[1:47:56] Hallelujah the wind blo where list as

[1:48:13] to be satisfied with
[1:48:15] this this is you know we are still
[1:48:18] growing into what we should be

[1:50:51] it into friends I'm not criticizing on

[1:51:41] want you to see a particular thing you
[1:51:43] don't see the rest of the stage and the
[1:51:45] rest of everything else it's like
[1:51:47] Hollywood Boulevard that's a dump
[1:51:50] but they just have a camera shot oh
[1:51:52] isn't this so neat they get their star
[1:51:54] or whatever they do you know in the
[1:51:56] concrete isn't this wonderful it's just
[1:51:57] a a dump of a street but it's a
[1:52:01] facade and you see people you see you
[1:52:04] know this whole world you know through
[1:52:07] the music through the movies they they
[1:52:09] project this is what life really is but
[1:52:12] then when you come to then you say well
[1:52:14] what is the reality of those actors and
[1:52:16] musicians Lives why do they die young
[1:52:20] why do they die of drug overdoses why do
[1:52:23] they go from one broken relationship to
[1:52:25] another broken relationship because that
[1:52:27] is the reality of what is being produced
[1:52:30] by the spirit that's upon them amen oh
[1:52:34] you say this has happened in the message
[1:52:36] I can't you know that doesn't mean this
[1:52:38] message doesn't produce real families am
[1:52:41] it doesn't produce real peace Joy love
[1:52:43] longsuffering goodness gentleness Faith
[1:52:46] amen but you look at the facade of
[1:52:48] Hollywood amen
[1:52:50] it's a facade amen amen there's nothing
[1:52:54] real there but people are so captivated
[1:52:56] by what the devil wants you to
[1:52:59] see
[1:53:01] amen and then he just brings that into
[1:53:03] the church and says now look at this
[1:53:06] person look at what they do wrong oh
[1:53:09] this is really how church should be and
[1:53:12] then most of the time it's just a
[1:53:14] facade cuz he doesn't he knows if you
[1:53:17] really step into the presence of God
[1:53:20] and really make contact with him then
[1:53:22] he's defeated remember the lifeline the
[1:53:25] lifeline is not just knowing quotes the
[1:53:28] lifeline is knowing him and the lifeline
[1:53:32] is where your strength comes from is the
[1:53:34] Lifeline where that is a stepping into
[1:53:36] the presence of God Amen brother Braham
[1:53:39] said about uh David's Mighty Men you
[1:53:42] know the story you know The Well of
[1:53:44] Bethlehem it's all garrisoned by
[1:53:46] Philistines and then David's there he
[1:53:48] says I just wish I could drink that cool
[1:53:50] water from The Well of Bethlehem they
[1:53:52] did when he was young and his three
[1:53:54] Mighty Men they they they they they
[1:53:57] picked up a bucket they took their
[1:53:58] weapons it was just like this it was the
[1:54:00] smallest desire it wasn't even a
[1:54:02] commandment but they took it as a
[1:54:04] commandment from David because they
