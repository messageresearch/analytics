on the same boat are we all going my way amen and i don't think anyone that's here tonight hearts desires not to meet the lord jesus christ so on that basis what can happen what can happen if all our

revealed to us your thoughts lord jesus so lord we come on that basis this evening we come to you as our friend lord and we know that you have a desire to meet here this evening lord we believe you're here in our midst now [Music] that's your thoughts towards us we can see lord by your actions what your thoughts are towards us lord and they're good they're righteous they're for us lord and we thank you that we serve a goddess for us lord before we were formed in our mother's womb you were for us before we came here you were for us lord when we were born you were for us before we knew you before we called upon you you were for us while we were in sin you were for us when we turned to you you were for us lord and as we walk with you you're for us and if god be for us and who can be against us so we thank you lord jesus that you're the almighty god this evening we just pray your blessed service lord jesus may you have the full control lord as we commit this service to you i rebuke every wrong spirit and hear in the name of the lord jesus christ yes the gates of hell will not prevail we're the victims in jesus christ this evening and i declare that he is here thank you lord in jesus name amen amen praise the lord god bless you all this evening just while you're standing i've got one scripture i want to read it's mark verse 4 chapter 4 verse 37 to 41. this is jesus when he's out on the water in a boat and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hindu part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and said unto him master charist thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked to the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him what manner of man is this and that's my topic this evening is what manner of man is this but it's also adoption so may bless your word lord and we just give you full control of the service now in jesus name amen you can take your seats um this evening it's good to be here it's good to be amongst um friends i find it very easy to talk with friends you know when you've got a good friend you can just go in there and you can sit down and talk and even if you don't talk it's just relaxing you know it's not there's no pressure and i feel that way this evening amongst this fellowship and i always do you know i feel there's no pressure we can just relax and um and i believe the lord's going to move in our midst tonight and i've got um i have intentions i have intentions declare that to declare that the lord is here and i have an intention to declare to all of you what the lord is going to do for all of you and i have an intention to let satan know that the greatest force that he's ever seen in his existence is coming upon him the greatest force he's ever seen and the existence of his time is coming upon him his kingdom is going to shake like he's never seen it shake before and he's not going to know what to do with it that's the program that we are in that's our program and that's his program and this is not made up to make you say amen but you're saying amen from your hearts because you believe it because you know this is what's happening this is the time that we live in and this is the season that we live in this is god's season for all of us and it's such an exciting time to be in and i want to declare to you all tonight you're on the winning team you're on the winning team and god is going to work through you like he never has through any other people on the face of this earth that's the truth when jesus went to the fit the wedding feast the wedding and they drank the wine and then at the end he turned water into why when they ran out of wine and the man said you've saved the best wine till the end usually you put it on at the start that's what this is the best wine has been saved for up for the end and satan's kingdom is going to shake like he's never known it and he's going to meet the most powerful people that he's ever met and he's going to meet a number of them and you are all them the world knows there's something happening the world knows there's something going on at the moment it's panicking you know when someone gets a bit scared maybe it's night time and they get a bit scared and they're on edge and they can't see anything and they hear something in the distance what do they do because they're on edge they panic what is that is someone there because they're already sensing something's happening something's happening something's going on they start to panic this covert thing is nothing but people are panicking because they know something is going on this world is a supernatural world it's not a natural world it's supernatural everybody knows there's something going on when they sit down it's just themselves in their thoughts they know there's something going on they know it's coming to a place where it's the end of all things people know and we know what is going on amen we are not walking in this confused and god has got a plan for you and for me a victorious plan none of you are here by chance you're not here because you just happen to stumble in you're part of the greatest force that's ever struck this world nobody no group of believers ever is going to have the power has got the power that you've all got ever in existence nobody it was promised now it wasn't although i was promised as a general promise when this enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard against it now that's not just making us feel good that's the way that this thing works that's the reality of what this is when the enemy comes in at its most powerful point god will raise up a standard more powerful than that more powerful that's what that scripture says when is the time where the most powerful forces come upon the church upon the believers when is the time now when all the demons were released when they're all around you you see satan all around you we're dwelling in satan's eden like we never have before all around us all around us people know it's like that too everybody knows us like that all around us but fear not amen you don't have to be scared there has been a standard raise up to combat and to easily defeat that enemy that's all around you easily do you remember who used to play computer games when they were small because they don't play them anymore we used to get cheat codes now and then and you just you can't beat this certain whatever it is and then your friend tells you i got a cheat code for that you just type on this and then you become invincible and you can just go in there and nothing they can do will harm you you can just go in there and you just beat them and it's like so easy it becomes boring you're like let's took all the fun out of it didn't i just walk in there and beat this person or this whatever this thing is you know that that's what we have we have a force so powerful that it becomes boring that we just win easily don't fear about all satan's what he's trying to do don't fear don't fear you don't have to fear at all there's a standard being raised up now more powerful than anything satan can throw he's got a real powerful force heading his way and it's you and it's me and we are coming into becoming adopted sons and daughters of god adopted okay now adoption when we talk about adoption i'm going to say i'm going to talk about this because you will know what i'm talking about but i just want to bring it through so we can talk about this because our understanding of adoption is you know you're not part of my family and i go to somewhere and i see a small child and i think i really like you and i will adopt you into my family then that child is not related to me whatsoever but i will adopt it in and then it will become my son or my daughter that's how we would think of adoption but there's a term called adoption that is not that type of adoption for us it's not that the true term of adoption that when brother branham was here he was preaching for everyone to come into that he was saying church you've lost your way you should be coming into adoption you should be coming into this place you've lost your way somewhere he was saying that now we realize it's for the bride this adoption is for the bride it wasn't for the whole church it was actually for the bride and i think he understood that as he went on it's for the bride now adoption can i stop here for a minute okay i'm going to start right way way back at the start all right and then i'm going to end up back there okay then i'm going to tell you something that i haven't told anyone before so we serve god you know but i want to take you through a bit of our christian walk that we go through we're all at different stages but we have a christian walk that we go through and the road is the same for every person they that's why pilgrim's progress struck such a chord because anyone could read that and realize well that's the same journey i took because it is a pilgrim's progress there is a road that we all take the lord leads us a certain way he has to do it he does it always the same way although the different people different circumstances generally it's it's there is the same path we all take it's it's like a tree a tree has to grow slowly god's got a way that it would grow that it would become strong and it he doesn't just have a tree shoot up overnight because he knows it's not going to be strong it's got to be slowly grow it's let its roots go down the wind blows it when it's small it gets a bit stronger when the wind shakes it gets stronger it grows so when it's big it can withstand powerful winds he doesn't just have it grow in this weak thing that falls over so god's got a system of doing things so we're all on our road as a christian and at one point in time we get a inkling maybe there's something else out there there's more to earth to life than what i'm doing at the moment you know if we didn't know god or if we didn't know god we maybe we're running away and we don't know whether we're going to serve him but at some point we decide to serve him we say some force i'm going to call it god the goodness of god causes us to want to serve and we say okay yes i will now that's the goodness of god that led us to repentance we say lord the path that i've been going down whether it be bad or really bad or not that bad at all because let's face it some of us were really bad some were not really that bad at all that's the truth right in terms of what we thought you know some of us didn't come to god with a big broken life we just said lord i just i just have a desire to serve you now we all had a broken life to some degree but you understand what i mean somewhere from here somewhere from there but we all come to that point and and a lot of people come to that point to want to commit their life over to the lord and then they start serving but what's the first thing that happens they get a bit of resistance and what happens to some of the people they fall away they get resistance they fall away and then but those of us that want to stay on we carry on and we say lord i'm going to carry on serving you you know the resistance comes the resistance says suddenly we can't be if we're young we can't be cool anymore because christianity is not not it's not generally accepted as we're not in the in crowd we're on the out crowd so young people have to suddenly grapple with this idea oh no i'm not going to be socially accepted anymore so what see in our mind we think so what as long as i'm accepted by god i don't care you know that's that's the way we we we get this pressure that our friends turn on us so what long as the law doesn't turn on me i don't care you know we we suddenly can't chase after money like maybe what we used to so what as long as the law's my provider i don't care we have different challenges we can't turn to things that we used to turn to for satisfaction we don't want that we just want the satisfaction from the lord see there's a price we all pay and the lord meets the lord asks everybody because he wants to see is this real what's in your heart are you going to pay the price that's why i went to the rich young ruler the rich ruler said i've done all these things from my youth you know i've kept all the comments i've done all this but he knew the thing in his heart was he wanted all his money so he had he hit the spot where he he thought this is where we will prove if you want to serve me or not by the thing that means the most to you and we all go come to that point all of us get quick get get pointed at that what is the thing that's the most important to you and will you be willing to give that up the same as abraham with a son what is the thing that's the most important to you will you be willing to give it up to serve me because that's what god wants is will you give up everything to serve me that's why when he came to the rich wrong ruler he said sell all your goods and give to the poor and come follow me you know and he went away sorrowful because he didn't want to pay that price see and we all get that choice and i believe you're all here because you paid that price the lord tested you on that one thing and you said yes now that's not the only thing you'll get tested on in your life but that's the most significant thing for you at that time enough to show that if if you're willing at that point in your life to surrender the most significant thing that shows that you will keep on doing it in other situations because from what you knew you were willing to surrender 100 from what you knew because we we walk on for two years and we think wow i thought i surrendered there now i've done all these other things but that didn't matter because at that point you surrendered all to what you knew right so you didn't get offended by what you had to sacrifice but what you had to what the cost was going to be you said no lord i'm going to carry on come on may like peter said lord we forsaken all to follow you he said come follow me i'll make you fishers of men he said okay threw his nets left his boat and left went that's what we do we need we say lord i want to serve you he says do you do you okay then do this and we say it may hurt us a bit but then there's always something more powerful than us that says i'll do it because we have a destiny to fulfill and that is to become adopted sons and daughters of god we have a destiny we have god has a plan and a purpose and he knows it in us lies that in us lies an adopted son or daughter of god that's what lies within us so then we serve god and then we start to have this thing called faith we think we understand why we can ask god for things because now we're feeling pretty good about ourselves and early in our christian walk we ask god for things and you know what happens we get them straight away we think wow i'm taking you on a journey right a christian journey we get it straight away and we hear young young people testify well i prayed for this one young man in australia he was at his work and he didn't like the radio always playing because they're blasting out this music in some factory he works and he said lord i just don't like that radio plane could you just make it turn off and then the radio stopped working and the guy that was always there trying to play it he was he's up there messing with this radio trying to get this thing going i think it didn't go for a couple of days you know until they maybe got another one but he had faith to believe if i can just ask god he was a new christian then i'll get it straight away right because now i don't want to put it like this but i have to put it like this when you're a baby a baby goes ah cries and they get what they want straight away or within a period of about five minutes because you they're just crying so much and they generally just want something simple watching some food or get changed or get put in bed you know they're quite simple things to look after they only want simple things and a new believer the lord treats him like that you don't you don't leave a new baby crying asking for something and crying and crying and crying you let him cry for a bit then you give it to him you know and that's the way it is for a new christian you get stuck straight away who's experienced that we started serving the lord and you'd ask the lord lord we need a place to live the next day you've got a place to live praise the lord and you're thinking man this is how it always works i just ask god for things and they just i just get them straight away but when you get it it increases your faith you think i believe this lord thank you i trust in you so then you're happy now the next stage comes on is one day you ask for something and you don't get it right and it's a bit confusing to you because you think well i've always just you know this is not really the way it's supposed to be i've always asked for things and i just get it straight away uh what's going on here you know and we start to question why didn't i get it did i do something wrong or god why aren't you hearing me you know we start to get like that but god doesn't want us like that he wants us if we ask we just wait he doesn't and he doesn't want to have to pamper to our every need or quickly i better get it to the more they'll cry that's called a spoiled child you know i'll get him what it wants so they'll cry you spoil people when you when they're like that you give them everything they want and they get so used to it so he has to get us out of that frame of mind and actually get us to a place where we actually have faith because if we just have faith when it happens then that's not real faith because it just happens we have to have faith when it's not happening and think it's all right it's going to be all right so now we go through the next phase of our walk now i need to interject here and say this is just our journey we all have our sanctification baptism um infilling of the holy ghost at different times i can't say you'll get yours here and you'll get yours you'll do that there it may be at the start that you get that in some experience like i believe shannon got hers and experience when she first met the lord just all and then happened then she got baptized then her walk her process began there other people that have maybe been brought up in church you know about the things of god that the things of god are not new to you so it's harder for you just to have this big light bulb experience well there's a god because you've been going to church for 15 years you're not going to suddenly think there's a god you're going to have to have some sort of other experience somehow and it may not be i want to say this that may not be a massive experience that you think well i it was here it may not be i don't know how god works he some people are not because they probably had that experience and that that's the way that god has chosen to work with you other people didn't know god and they meet god like brother andy there's a god wow i didn't know this you know it's different me i was brought up in church you couldn't surprise me with god when i was 15. i knew there was a god i just had to figure out god had to make his own way for me to surrender to him okay so when i'm talking about that process i'm not gonna this whole process i'm talking about your journey within how the process of being baptized and sanctified and receiving the holy ghost is all is going to be different for all of you it's it's not the same but the journey we go on through that is always the same because we have to become these these believers that are full of faith because that's our journey as faith so so we start asking for things and then we don't get them anyone had that and our life starts to go bad anyone had that and we don't know what's going on we don't know why do you throw it all out or do you say lord i don't know why but i believe you i don't know what's going on but i trust you right now if you haven't had that experience yet don't worry you'll get it you'll get it guaranteed everything will go wrong and you won't know why nothing will go right until you perceive it but have faith in god that's all part of your learning and your building and the molding of your faith because you must learn to trust in god above anything else and be at peace always be at peace that's what we must that's what god is trying to teach us to trust in him so we sometimes this phase is a long phase i've been up here song leading and maybe i even preached one day on a sunday and then i've been dragged into court on a monday and i think lord this is not even becoming of a believer and i'm sitting in the courthouse in lower heart waiting there for my hearing i'm thinking lord this is this is not really funny if the brethren knew i was here doing this this is not really what a believer does on monday in court some charges that that the lord knows i didn't do them or it's like oh why this is not i didn't i didn't purposely end up here i haven't done didn't go out to maim somebody or hurt them and then end up here because of you know it's you we don't know why but we trust in god and and but we have to learn to have faith in god and so you're going to go through that stage where everything is going to go there will be a time where things just won't go right for you whatsoever right but that's to mold your faith to mold and strengthen your faith because your faith has to be strengthened now you it's good there you know you're starting to get a bit stronger but but believers all through the ages have had been through this this is not a new journey this is not a new journey but i want to bring it now to the next step further after that after you've been through however many years i don't know what it is but for us because we live in the time that we live in for us here because there's such an onslaught of satan on every hand brother branham when he was here he said if i had a tv in my house i'll blast it out with a shotgun right now this is almost comical we've got a fridge with a tv on it in the fridge you connect your phone and you watch tv on the fridge you know he was talking about it in in the lounge now there's one in the kitchen on an appliance you get to keep food cold that's the world that we live in now we can laugh at that but through all these devices satan is coming in at every avenue and there needs to be a way that we rise up against that and and can combat that and overcome it easily easily there's got to be a way and there is there's an all-powerful god that's raised up a standard that we are going to defeat all of this easily all of the onslaught of satan from every hand all the fear that he's trying to put on at the moment all the confusion we're going to overtake that easily and the method that we have now which brother brandon was preaching when he was here is adoption as a placed son of god or a daughter of god a place son of god now jesus when he was on the ship he was he'd been preaching all day he was maybe a little hoarse he was tired when they got into the boat he thought i want to have a sleep i'm tired it's been a big day maybe he didn't eat all day maybe he just had some food that evening and went to sleep and he wanted to sleep and so he lay down in the boat and he went to sleep now satan thought oh here's my chance i'm going to drown him and his disciples in the middle of this sea so he started he can do this he started making the wind blow and everything and churning it all around and the sea was churning and the the disciples were starting to panic and they were trying to bail out the boat and put this sail in the right way and stare towards the right way that their sailing skills would tell them this is the way we've got to go now the wind's blowing this way turn this way there maybe they were disputing that a lot of them will fish them and they were boats when they they were figuring out how to do it and then they started to panic so much that they they were upset with the lord because he was with jesus because he was asleep in the boat they said master don't you care that we perish and he got up and he had a desire in his heart he knew a few things and and we need to catch this but i'm going to talk about this again he had a desire in his heart which was he wants to get some sleep yeah i'm tired i want to sleep he had another thought in his heart i have a desire to end up at calvary at this particular place that's my end not here right amen so he wakes up and he's he he wants to have a sleep he wants to sleep in a nice calm boat and he wants to the boat to gently drift to another shore in the morning he gets out and carries on that was his desire so then as a son of god what does he do he wait he gets out he stands up and he says rain stop wind stop that's right i'm going back to sleep right that's what he does he just says stop and he late then he lay back down and went to sleep the disciples said what manner of man is this what manner of man is this that even the wind and the waves obey him what manner of man what was he he was that was god in flesh a placed adopted son of god that had a desire so he just expressed it because what was happening was contrary to what he wanted to do and what he knew he was supposed to do so he just said when stop waves stop i'm going to sleep he was a place adopted son of god as are all of you amen you are the same if you were in the boat and you knew i've got to go to such and such a place and i'm actually quite tired an adopted son of god can stand up in the boat and say when stop waves stop i'm going back to sleep what manner of man is this see at that time there was one man causing trouble to satan's kingdom let me tell you there's going to be a lot of people causing trouble what manner of people is this because an adopted son of god is no different than god and flesh no different no different you're no different that's exactly what you are when jesus was walking along i just want to say one more but i'm going to carry on where jesus was walking along and there was a fig tree up ahead and he was hungry but it was about let's say folks come in the summer it was maybe it was like september and there were no figs on there because it wasn't the season for the figs but he walked past the tree he he did want some fruit though in his heart i want some fruit he saw the tree and for some reason i'll just say that for some reason he said no one's gonna eat any more fruit off you because he wanted some fruit there was none on there he just said no one's gonna eat any more fruit and carried on they went to the city did what they did they walked out the next day the disciples walked past the same fig tree and it was dead it was withering up and dying and they said he just spoke to that yesterday that no one's gonna eat any more fruit today we walk past and it's dying what manner of man is this what manner of man is this okay now i want to go back to the adoption idea right we go through this journey in our life in our christian walk and god tests us and tries us he tests and tries us because he wants to get us to a place where we have all authority and power everything he wants to get us to a place exactly like what he was when he was here that's that's his plan and purpose for us is what he was when he was here you tell me why it's any different you tell me why you tell me why if you wanted something off a tree you can and you were up i wouldn't say upset because i said i don't know why he did it no one will eat fruit off you anymore that tree will die or there'd be no fruit ever growing that tree ever again right now because adoption we go through this walk but god tests us and tries us because he wants to see is there characteristic like my characteristic are they going to act in situations like what i would act that's why we will go through hard things we'll go through challenging times we'll be tested in ways things like our judgment will be humiliated so we understand righteous judgment all of the pride will be beaten out of us because we have to understand righteous judgment we have to be humble god has to get us out the way so that he sees they're all out of the way he'll humiliate us in life if we're prideful he'll let us go through things to humiliate us to get that out of it whatever that thing is in us that that that if that got a hold of power then that would go the wrong way with it he has to get all of that out of us that's why the believer is going to go through hard things you're going to wonder why you you're going to be tried and tested like jesus said to that too that moses said to the church god said to moses look i've brought them these 40 years to try them and test them and see what's in their heart and that's the process we're all going through as you're being tried and tested if you're not you should be now i'm going to get back to back god tries and tests us because the purpose to he wants that we have to get to not not we might get to what we are into i'm going to say into as an adopted son of god now they have a ceremony in this tradition the actual son is has a tutor which is and brother brown typed at the holy ghost but they have a tutor and they are taught and trained in all different things and the tutor goes back to the to the father and he says i've been seeing the sun the sun's been doing really good all the door's been doing really good they're doing this and this and this he says well that's good i'm happy with that that's good um yep keep going though because i've seen a few things so he goes back and he what he's doing is the the tutor knows what the father's character character is like and he knows what the father's intentions are and he knows how he runs his business he understands that and his job is to impart that same method characteristic and wisdom to the son that's his job or the daughter that's his job so he so this tutor will keep going and he'll keep training and the father is watching this happen and he's seeing his own characteristics coming to his son now his son's not in charge of nothing yet his son could ask father i need this could i get it i suppose you can yes here you go another day father i'm i'm you know i'm feeling really sick or might say that like i i would like to to buy this new horse may i can you give me some money to buy it yeah i guess you need a horse here's something okay he will ask for things right he will ask don't miss her see he will ask could i have this could i have that because he doesn't he doesn't own the father's wealth yet he's not the leader he his father is here he's here he asks could i have this could i have that you understand what i mean we asked lord could have this thought could i have that jesus didn't say lord may not eat from that tree he said tree no one will eat from you he got up to the boat and he said wind stop rain stop he didn't ask anybody because he was almighty god he just said stop he's in control of it all this is the father the father just say stop tree die that's what the father says he doesn't ask oh would that treat her who does he ask that's the apex of authority he's the apex of authority he doesn't ask anybody he says what he wants and it happens that's the way that it works now how are we any different when we come to the place of adoption how are we different than that no different we're no different so god at a certain point after been through all these things we decided to serve the lord we've said lord i'll give up everything and he knows we mean it we've gone through these trials and testings and all of these this prideful thing this that whatever it is in our life has been taken out and we've been tried and tested sometimes we don't know why but it's hard and it's listen to that don't worry about all that just keep going through it and at a certain point at a certain point at a certain point now now for all of us this is the bride's this is us at a certain point god looks at you he looks at you you you you he looks at you and he says i can see exactly that if you had all of my authority and all of my power if you had all of that at your disposal you'll do exactly as i would do if you had everything that i have what you speak goes every devil there were ten thousand devils ten thousand devils that were trying to sink that boat he just got up and spoke wind stopped rain stop why because he had absolute authority that's what i'm saying there's a force coming against the kingdom of satan that he's never encountered before when a people have absolute authority they just say stop they don't have to work themselves up and try and they say stop they don't even say it loud stop it's not about how loud i can go i'm going to go louder so you might be fearful of me no it's a position a positionally placed son of god has all the authority of god everything you don't have to ask you don't ask you say lord please stop this rain no no rain stop amen when brother branham was up the mountain he wanted to go hunting he got up the mountain he said to the brothers if it starts snowing you head back down because it's going to come in real fast and snow comes over we can't see nothing get out you'll be you'll be lost in the snow he was up there and it started snowing and he thought i better get back down but he had a desire to go hunting i've got a desire to hunt i'm disappointed i have to walk back down this hill because i came all this way to go for a hunt now god was for the hunt god was also for the hunt you know what i think it's a great idea you go for a hunt there he was for the hunt you go for a hunt god's for the hunt he's for the hunt now he's walking back down the hill not hunting something wrong with this picture god said there's something wrong with this picture go back up there you're hunting didn't you go hunting you want to go hunting so he walks back up the hill now this didn't happen so we can talk about it oh we serve a miraculous god this happened to show us who we are and what we have as positionally placed sons of god it wasn't to tell a story it's not i'm here telling you the story and we praise god because he did that although it's praiseworthy it's not for that and so we can understand this is us he stood there and god told him you can just tell that storm to disappear amen tell it to go so he said wind go rain go storm go you go away till i finish hunting here then you can do what you want after that you're free from my word you're free from the word that i've spoken when i finished here now what happened the wind the rain the clouds disappeared the snow it all stopped now now a positionally placed son of god if he has a desire can speak and that is what happens now that those things like with the squirrels i'll have a squirrel go from there to there he didn't ask for it he just said okay there to there and it went there a positionally placed son of god you know what you're saying you know what you're doing and what you say goes it's not it's not second guessed there's no committee that it goes to oh he said this shall we let it through shall we let this request through there's no committee it goes through a positionally placed son or daughter of god when they express a desire from their mouth it happens straight away it happens like they say it's going to happen because it came out of their mouth do you understand that's why elisha he had he had a touch of this and he cursed those boys and the bears went and got them that's why we're going to be tried and tested but when we our our program for all of us all of you you are this amen okay you are this this is what you all are i'm going to declare in jesus christ you're all adopted sons and daughters of god you are if you're not here if if you're not there yet you will be there's a ceremony that's going to happen with you with all of you a ceremony and god is going to say yes now is the time okay that's an occasion that's not something we make up that's an occasion that happens it's an event it's an event and it doesn't happen today and it's not here tomorrow it happens and that's you you're an adopted place son of god or daughter of god your life is never ever the same ever amen ever i want to tell you a little story so the camp was a powerful time for me who had a powerful time at camp and i'm just gonna i'm gonna tell you the story that i'm gonna close the camp it was very powerful i got back from camp and i was on such a high that i didn't perceive how how much of a spiritual place i was in not to say that i'm anything it's just that there was a powerful presence of god at the camp and and i guess when you're just a bathing in it you you just it doesn't feel it feels normal because it's just been you're around her but i think when you go away and you're not around it it's a different you realize well i was actually and this this is quite an uh a spiritual time you know so and i'm going to declare something and this is a bit of a declaration of war to satan but you've got to lay out you've got to lay it out at some point so this is that we're going forward is it because this is the path we're all on this is not we're not just here to play we're not just here to you know come along we are the most powerful people in the face of the earth and satan's going to know all about it so after about two days i was three days whatever day it was maybe it was tuesday night we got back on maybe it was thursday night or whatever this has happened a couple of times and three or four times you know you in my life you just feel like i need to pray about something i mean you feel like to pray all the time but sometimes it just comes on strong and you you can't do anything you've just got to go and go and pray right you just gotta say lord you don't know why you just think i just have to there's something the lord wants to say something i don't know what it is now i don't want to appear like i'm spiritual but we all are spiritual and god can speak to each one of us doesn't matter how non-intellectual we are goggles but god speaks to all of us this is the way he deals with me he just puts this little feeling and i just have to go and lord and it's not made up i think i i'm going to try and make up this feeling and i don't think any of you do the same thing when you have your experience with god it's not made up it just happens a certain way and i was i didn't know what it was and i was sitting in in the office in my office and i sat down and and i had four words come to me that didn't make any sense at all and i wrote these words down on my phone because i thought that i would try and get away from the words and i'd just keep writing the words again this is strange words why would i write these four strange words so i just typed them into my phone and i sat my phone on my desk and i just started praying and just just meditating and forgot about the phone and it was a very powerful time because i was sitting there and i'm sitting there just not knowing about the phone and i this whole thing started happening this that out of the blue this whole lord i said that these thoughts started coming and like the lord is speaking because you're just in a and he's taken me through the process of adoption now make of what you want i'm sitting there and the lord showing me these things he says now is the time and he said he's saying it's hard to describe but something is dif something understands differently it just happens a certain way it just goes you can just and you understand he says this just happens once and then you're it you're never ever going to think the same again you can never do the same things you've ever done it life for you will never ever be the same this is happening and it's going to change your whole life you'll never be the same never and you start to get you you're thinking of this and he's saying and you then thoughts come and you start to think then what does that make me if i'm that then i can just speak things then how powerful does that make my tongue i'm thinking lord i'm thinking then you start to think of jesus you think when he was anything that's why he just said true uh fig tree don't grow anymore you understand the i think well i could do that i'm not saying and but you understand i see why he could just walk along and say that and carry on and it dies because that's what an adopted place son of god does and you start to understand this is why i've been going through all that stuff so that it's like how do i even open my mouth anymore how do i speak anymore this is such a powerful thing what i say goes right because what jesus said went is that correct now a place to adopt a son of god that has all the authority every single bit of authority of the kingdom of god what happens when he speaks a desire what is entwined in that desire everything all authority is in and when that word comes out what is that that comes into the existence of this natural realm what is that it's the third pull it's the it's the power of god it's the place adopted son of god just speaks um and i'm there thinking this is kind of a little bit i'm not thinking it's too intense but i'm thinking this is a strange thought and then i think lord i and i don't remember what i've written down the four words and i think lord what did i what did i write down i said maybe maybe there's something in there because i genuinely didn't remember god as my witness i didn't know what i wrote down i see maybe there's something in there that ties in with this because if it is i'll know this is from you if it's not i know i'm just don't know you know so i read my words that i wrote down that i i'm just saying i wasn't going to say anything about this but i'm just going to declare that he is here and that this is all of you and that this is that satan's got adopted sons and daughters of god heading his way with all the authority and the power of god so the first word i wrote down was grass i think lord i've just i've you know this is not making any sense the next word i wrote down was once the next word i wrote down was words and the last word was speak and it the lord's and this was i didn't know what grass meant but when i was having that experience the lord said this is just this just happens once life is never ever ever the same after this never you it doesn't that god doesn't think oh actually uh you did adoption thing the other day um yeah uh actually can we just backtrack on that i'll just grab the paperwork back and we'll i've decided to you know do it a year's time he doesn't do that it's once it doesn't and your life is never the same words because you start to understand the how powerful is this jesus when he was there he just spoke when god created the world he had a desire for some light he had a desire there so he said spoke out let there be light and there was light he didn't have to go to work didn't make it he just said let there be it was words and then speak we just we control everything by how we by what we speak not just not positive speaking but actually as a place adopted son of god right and i'm and i couldn't really talk for a couple of days i didn't say things yeah but i could talk a little bit but she wondered why i was going all funny because i thought lord this is hard how do you possibly engage with people like if this thing is so powerful how do we engage right you understand like if jesus was walking along and he said that house is such a silly house i wish that house wasn't there that house would fall down if he just like if he had a genuine desire it would fall down do you understand so it puts us in a predicament what of all this how do i engage how do i talk you can't even i still have to converse i've got things i've got to do i've got to deal day-to-day stuff how does this all work after a couple of days i went parked up at the river and i just looked down at the grass and i i thought you know we can i can probably just talk about the grass like it's just grass this grass is green the grass has to get mowed now and then the sheep eat the grass we pull out the grass you know it's a it's a subject that is just grass we we go to work we are involved in this so this piano is if i'm a piano sales person yeah this is piano it was a casio it's got this many keys it's you know it's black it costs two thousand dollars it's just it's just words it's just grass we can just converse like it's grass this here is a seat but if i had a desire in my heart for that piano and and and i and and it made it through and i thought i want that piano i could speak out i want that piano in my house now that's different because that's coming now from a desire right when god said let there be lightness because he had a desire for there to be light so he said let there be light but jesus would converse with his disciples how did you sleep you sleep well did you you know yeah have some of this would you like some i've just finished cooking this here would you like something it's just conversing it's just grass it's just factual things that because we have to still converse this is where i thought how am i gonna even operate in this world like this but as soon as we have a desire and we want it we can that's different because that comes from a desire and when that comes out that's now that's different than talking about that piano as black do you understand me it's different it's actually it's coming now from a place of desire and we can have it and not not not we can have it that's it and you think differently because when you when you think of something let's say jesus because he wanted to go to calvary and he was in the boat he could just speak his way there okay one stop rain stop i'm going over here we're the same because we know where we're going if we know what the lord's purpose is we just speak and he said that we had a certain issue and i said i thought no that this has got to be this way for this thing i'm trying to achieve for the lord i said that will be this particular way he said to me because he didn't know i haven't i've mentioned this to me said are you speaking that by faith or did god tell you just as a passing conversation and i said what's kind of the same thing but you understand because when you when you're fully surrendered to the lord and you serve the lord then you just speak it there's going to be like this and i'll tell you what to this day it's like that it's like that now this is not me this is us this is what brother branham preached this is this is all of us this is our journey satan thought he had trouble with one man jesus christ walking around he thought he had trouble that's why i say he's got a force coming against him that he is not going to know what to do with the most powerful force to hit him is on its way at the door and he's not going to know what to do with it why because i'm looking at about what 40 here 40 people that are just like jesus christ exactly the same exactly the same power exactly the same you are god and flesh placed adopted sons of god that's who you all are imagine that's why this that the song says there's a bride rising up amen because they are placed adopted place sons and daughters of god that then don't have to fear anything don't worry about anything you just walk and if you know where you're going and something's not the way it should be what do you do lord make this this way yes kind of but why can't you say this is gonna be that way this will be that way that will be that way jesus said that when he was here this will be that way see now that we've now that we've brought this out satan's going to be all upset right but this is who you all are this is what brother brown's desire was for us to become placed adopted sons of god and he said to the church this is where you're all going wrong you're going off and all this other stuff you are all supposed to be here this is where you're all supposed to be then you realize it's actually for us so that's why i declare this is what is for all of us placed adopted sons of god you are no different than jesus christ walking on earth no different absolutely no different at all and you can't make it up you can't it's not that it's god and it's surrendering your life completely to god and god knows and he he i can see my son i can see myself in them now and that's it and life is never ever ever the same never because there's a difference between saying father could i have that over there versus i want that do you understand there's a there's a there is a difference these are not the same now when you're over here what chance does satan have i talked about the cheat code that i'm closing now what chance does he have he's going to be sitting waiting oh no what are they going to say we're going to try and get them this way when they find out what we're trying to do what are they going to say because satan's always trying to trick and sneak in and do things careful guys as soon as they see us we're done as soon as they find out our plan we're done because as soon as they speak it's all over it doesn't matter how many devils every think about this now is my last thought think about this every single devil in hell every single millions and millions of them could come against you everything the whole of the the kingdom of satan could come against you and you could just say go back amen amen that's right right it doesn't have to be all this there's the whole kingdom i'm going to need a couple of guys here now it doesn't work like that they were you understand yeah it doesn't work like that you just say you who are you and if you and you will speak what the desire of god is now that goes without saying right you can't you won't get there without just being able to then suddenly oh make this world make that it won't happen that way but it just like paul he was harassed by that lady for days days after a couple of days maybe the lord said okay tell her to go sit down go you know it's like that you don't just speak stuff you think man what i speak goes i'm not just gonna speak stuff i'm going to just you you wait you think lord when and then now and then you get a desire say this and you know when you say it that's it it's a cheat code i shouldn't call it that but it's just it becomes too easy and as the pressure comes on more you just if you get real hungry this is what now this is what i'm getting to know like if you get really hungry that's why you can just speak your dinner onto the table i desire some food i'm quite hungry and i don't believe i'm going to die of starvation because i believe i've got to go to the air to see brother sign so that's my calling and i'm quite hungry today and i'd like this for dinner you think that right so you think and if it gets through you think yes i can get that you just speak it and we'll be there dinner this is not a made-up story this is the force that satan's got coming against me trying to starve us out you know let's let's not let them get any food no we don't need to put supplies in our cupboard stack up on cans we've got the the manna from heaven the jesus feed the five thousand he just said okay pray for the food and and he said to them distribute the food we just we can say okay president line up amen seconds you see that's who we are that's that's the force that satan's got there is no angle he can come that he can get us and it's and this is just one person one person this whole kingdom cannot defeat one person one place adopted son of god they one person think of the trouble he's gonna have this whole bunch of them if you can't even defeat one single person that's what i said at the start he's got something coming on to his kingdom that he's never ever ever seen before in the existence of his whole time he's been here his whole miserable time and amongst this whole peril that he's trying to create the satan's eden right in the midst of that god raises up his standard and says here's my final operation here's my final force and it's more powerful than anything you can ever do when the spirit of when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard against it it's over all of the stuff and you just walk along humble it's going to be i'm going to read you one poem then i'm done this is the poem they wrote about brother brown and then i'm finished okay because here's here's the characteristic of an adopted son and i'm going to say daughter of god he's not a man of stature at all this is what the brethren wrote about him that knew him they wrote it and they put it on a read this and you'll understand this is what an adopted son of god looks like he's not a man of stature tall nor lofty in his way he sounds himself no trumpet as he goes from day to day has no desire for wealth or fame but none his place could fill he's just the way we want him our own dear brother bill he teaches us with faithfulness the undiluted word no fancy ways no love for praise just following the lord his speech is soft and gentle he raises not his voice except to cry against the wrong and then he has no choice never got a lot of learning from colleges and schools but he knows what's important and he's sure nobody's full for the knowledge he has given is eternal from above he has no creed except for christ in the law but sovereign love there was no great announcement to his lowly humble birth but to us he's the greatest man who lives upon the earth they don't mean outside of christ we count it more than privilege to know him as a friend we cherish all he stands for and will write to the end he says he's not a preacher he's modest as can be but get him in the pulpit and it isn't hard to see he was for ordained a prophet let men call it what they will god granted us great favor when they gave us brother bill now remember this is not stories this is reality he was that first wave she's offering amen he was the first one that's why he said wind go back to where you were for three days why because he's saying this is what the rest of the the crop is going to look like this that's it that's why that's that didn't happen that's why it didn't happen to tattoo so we say wow that was a great miracle no to show this is you squirrels go here cancer go to show this is you that was the wave sheath that's and that's all of us that's god's plan for all of you people here it's going to be the most fantastic series of years whatever it's going to be the most fantastic time the believers ever had and we all get to be a part of it and we're all on that journey it's going to be where the world is going to go to complete chaos and we're going to be having so much fun we're going to be just relaxing and enjoying you know just just walking with the lord it's going to be we're in for such a good time this is the greatest time that's why brother branham said lord i'd rather live now than any other time this is the most exciting time don't fear fear not little flock it's my father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom don't fear amen i'm gonna let's just stand tonight i'm gonna ask the musicians to come and we'll just pray tonight lord we thank you lord that you have cared for us so much lord that while we were yet sinners you died for us lord and that we are we've been recipients lord of your of your force of love towards us lord that has pursued us lord jesus that's all we can say lord when when we sit back we're overwhelmed lord by the by the pursuing love of god lord that that loved us when we didn't deserve love lord that that was for us when we weren't even for you you
