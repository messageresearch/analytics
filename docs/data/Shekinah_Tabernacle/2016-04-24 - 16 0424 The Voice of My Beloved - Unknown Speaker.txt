amen praise the Lord you can take your seats here this morning that's it for John um yep oh sister Shannon in my heart that the for our children and I don't know what I would do if I was not Christian and have children it is is hard even to be a Christi children is and US few with children one was was baby he W him up too much and he was going through time he was feverish anyway my w up and then when I went and checked on you know anyways he just wouldn't stop and everything was coming out of him he was too hot he was anding and all the liquids just completely poured out of them and um you know when they lose control thees of their eyes show and here's Isaac and I were just going what's going on we didn't know what was going on because we're firsttime parents never even come across this stuff so guess what I did I tried to feed Isaac wrapped him up in a blanket and we walked around with him praying he should have died you know he should have died we did completely the wrong thing you should have been brain damage um but but in our in the prayer the Lord knew what what he was doing and through the prayer he's even too smart for his own good now so and the Lord just looked after him and the other the other time was quite a um miraculous heing um I given him some um medication later on they pulled it off the shelf but um he was just had a snipple and i' given it to him and I was I I was feeding a baby and when I turned around I given Jessie a piece of like white bread while he was laying there you know not feeling well and I turned around after feeding and I looked and um he was just lying there de pretty much the the his eyes or she just wasn't responsive at all and I thought oh goodness tried waking him up and then that wasn't working so I um went downstairs and I you know maneuvered him to get the bread out that came out but no response whatsoever put him under the shower no response by this time it was you know a couple minute old seemed like ages anyway so when all fa I lifted up up and I cried I cried out and I said Lord help me but I was like a furious like oh Lord he's going to die any um he came to right then his eyes started coming back and he started breathing again and then I just held him for a while and and he came back he came right and then Satan came creeping in my head and go you know it was that it was just because you did that and I was like no can I just start I I thank the Lord of course I was singing and thanking the Lord but that that little bit of Doubt came in you know oh you know wasn't I open my bible right you know how sometimes you just flip open your Bible and you want to hear from God and this is what I turn to straight away read this in my distress I Cried unto the Lord and he hurt me and there are countless times countless times where the children come off and they say oh this person fell from a tree and you know how high up the leaves can climb I'm like okay and you just say thank you Lord for watching over our children and he does it every time never fa and so [Applause] good Shannon during the i t one of my s in chur another just to say how I you and then I get these long voice memos back so it took about half an hour to listen to it and she just started okay this is what the Lord's been doing and she decied and as I was listening I was thinking that's what I'm going that's I'm going I'm going I was just thinking how much we need each other and the body of Christ that actually um we all go through similar things and like it's funny at the same time brother was pring in the Lord and Andy was just that just on a Wednesday night was simple just Delight the in the of it and then while was preaching and just and it was funny the sister that I text one of her testimonies was she said I actually to get in contact with you but I had I had um done it yet but then she messaged me to that she had been going through some trials as well and she put her hand in her pocket one morning because she noticed that she's been walking around with she she just felt more discouraged and she said my joy you know I wasn't looking with a smile I Wasing with a she said Lord what is the key now

bless you friends amen it's good to be in his house hallelujah amen if if you got your Bibles handy let's just go to the Song of Solomon I want to go to chapter 2 amen The Song of Solomon Chapter 2 and verse 8 just read down to verse 17 [Music] the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he he standeth behind our wall and lookth forth through the W uh he he lookth forth at the windows showing him forth through the lattice my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for Lo the winter has passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth and the time time of the singing of birds has come the voice of the turtle and actually means turtle dove the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape uh give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs of The Rock and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for thy for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is come take us the foxes the little foxes that spil the Vines for our Vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and I am his he Feth me among the lies until the day break and the Shadows flee away turn my beloved be thou like a row or a young heart upon the mountains of Betha amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may be seated I want to I want to try and there's always things that you look in the word and you think it's far beyond a grasp of a human I feel definitely that way you know there's something there's something about the about the word that speaks to you like only God can speak you know it's more than just a this is more than this is more than words on paper it's more than a history book in some moral guide of life but God has so put himself in print form that we can read his word and no doubt many people have picked up the Bible and many people have read the Bible and many people have memorized the Bible but we understand it's a love letter to you that God would would so hide himself even in his word he's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent Jesus would thank the father he said thank you Father that these things are hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but revealed unto babes because here he was the word himself made flesh and he was standing there and you know among the most religious people in all the Earth and they should have seen him for what he was because they had the word they had had the word since you know you know since Moses would write it down and Moses was inspired to write the you know Genesis and the creation and all the way down the first five books of the Bible and you know they had the Prophecies of Isaiah they had the Prophecies of Jeremiah and all the prophets all the way down and they spoke of Christ Hallelujah they spoke of the word that had become flesh in their day and here he was standing in front of them interpreting the word he was the prophecies fulfilled he was the Old Testament fulfilled and he was standing there and they didn't recognize him for what he was am me because this was just a bunch of memory to them it was just something they had learned by memory they had you know those those ones and the old test of those scribes and Pharisees it said that they knew their Torah so well that when they rolled it up that when when they put a pin through the pages if they ever would do such a thing they could tell you the the the character on every page that it would pass through that's how well they knew the word was put together but that didn't give them eternal life Jesus said to them search ye the scriptures from them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me amen so that he said you think you have eternal life search the scriptures and they did search the scriptures they were very knowledgeable in the scriptures but it didn't give them eternal life amen amen because they had not entered into a relationship ship with the author of the book 66 books in the Bible written over thousands of years but yet it's imp perfect continuity one does not contradict the other amen someone would speak of Prophecy here the other would enlarge on the prophecy here and then we can see it coming to its fulfillment further on the road Hallelujah this book is not just the writings of man or some moral ideas but this is God in print for amen do you really respect this just think about we have the word we have we have thus sayi the Lord in print form amen we have the voice of our beloved has been written down in in ink Hallelujah and he's been given to you amen and not only you can just read it but you can hear an audio version you can go wherever you want and you can hear the voice of God am mean you can hear the word for yourself amen but to you you but to some people and the very reason it doesn't mean that much to them they may think it's a wonderful thing they may even some people they get caught up in how well it's put together and they get caught up in the types and the shadows and they get caught up in the doctrine but it goes beyond just understanding Doctrine and types and shadows even though we should see these things and understand those things but it when it comes when that voice comes to you amen and you enter into that relationship for yourself amen where the voice of God means more than information to you or more than just church teaching or more than coming to a Sunday and just coming to church or or opening the pages but there's something in that voice amen Hallelujah there's something in the voice of God that can only that speaks to a person like only he can speak and notice I said he can speak not like not the word because he is the word amen he is the word he is a person and that person became flesh in Jesus Christ and then now but many people think well he finished speaking there and what what Peter James and John and Paul they wrote well that's just kind of their musings and things and maybe some people think well he stopped speaking there but God is the same in every generation amen he's the same yesterday today and forever we understand that it says in the Book of Revelation where where where where John is John is instructed to write to the write to the churches and we understand that you know you know in chapter one and then in other places in the Book of Revelation it's called a book of Prophecy so it is a prophetic book and it's speaking of future ages of the church it's not something that was fulfilled back there or it's going to be fulfilled one day today but we are in the midst of that book being fulfilled that's right and John am me let's just go to Revelations chapter 1 if you've heard the voice many people heard Jesus preach but they didn't hear the voice many people heard John the Baptist and there in the River Jordan and and preach repentance but they didn't hear the voice they heard desels you know they heard sound W strike their ear but they didn't hear the voice that was behind the voice and speak to their heart amen many people heard Jemiah and Moses you know Moses preached to Millions literally millions of people 2 million came out of Egypt I think it was he preached to millions of people but yet only Caleb and Joshua heard the voice behind the voice in his you know in their generation and they said that's for me Hallelujah because God it's so I just I was just sitting there last night think how can I put this into words how God he he he he he projects things you know you know prophecy he kind of he kind of paints an image paints a picture and puts it before you amen you know you know like a prophecy Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth Emmanuel you know unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and he should be called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God that was God putting forth an image in front of the people through through Isaiah he was he was painting a picture with words and many people thought that that was an incredible thing how how could a woman ever bring forth a child never knowing a man but yet God was putting something before the people and and it took 800 years for it to be fulfilled but one day there was a predestinated little girl a young woman was upon the Earth no doubt when Isaiah said those things every every every man who had a young daughter about the age that could have a child they would think it's going to be my daughter amen it's going to be my daughter but God just let it linger there for 800 years but the picture was always there then finally there's a predestinated girl there amen amen and they would have they would have maybe the rabbi was inspired one day to pick up the scroll and open it to Isaiah and go to Isaiah what we call 9 and verse six and speak that scripture and and something something would have anchored in Mary this is more than a just coming to church for her that day it was more than just coming to the synagogue and maybe just more than hearing the word but something anchored in her heart Hallelujah something became alive to her I trust you can put yourself in those shoes as well am mean when you've heard the word something just just just just just something spoken to you like nothing else has spoken to you before and you know she would probably you know speak to Joseph say Joseph that was a different kind of service amen I mean there was a different kind of meeting I've never you know I've read that scripture before I've heard that scripture before especially now how we everyone's under expectation that the messiah's going to come amen but yet something that day spoke to me Hallelujah and then after that you know I'm just kind of dramatizing a little bit more but then you know just to make it you know the prophet dramatizes the word just to try and make it a bit more alive to you amen amen and then and then she would have been walking down am me to get water from the well maybe and there was a man about 200 lb 6ot strong looking man you know shoulder Hing lay H uh hair you know white robes and she you you know he said to her Hil Mary he had never he had never she met him before in her life and and and then but there was a presence around around this man that was very different to every other men she had ever walked in front of and and then he began to say to her I'm Gabriel sent from the presence of the Lord You're going to have the promised son she says how could this be I've never known a man he says yeah he said the holy spirit will overshadow you and you'll bring forth the Messiah and she just said Let It Be unto me according to your word hallelujah the image had been put in front of her Hallelujah and she just accepted what God God was telling her and she just stepped into what God had said Hallelujah that's the same thing even in this day when you know I was thinking of you know brother Brown preaching the future home and he would begin to describe the you know the great New Jerusalem that came you know you know was going to come out of God from Heaven it's going to rest upon this Earth and you know he would begin to go in how how God you know redeems the Earth the same way he redeems you amen how he baptized and then Peter picks us up in the scripture he said you know you know how you you how in Noah's Day the Earth was baptized with water that's right amen but sin came over in the ark it's the same thing with the believer repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so the Earth was baptized with water but then sin still came over in the ark and we understand that it did and then Jesus came and he Sanctified the Earth by dropping his blood upon the Earth and and Paul says by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified amen hallelujah so so so he Sanctified the Earth he cleansed the Earth but sin is still here amen and you can be Sanctified God can take the desire isn't that incredible I'm just going to be at home today isn't it Incredible God can just take a desire out of you amen we know you know people down in Nelson brother Maru and brother Clayton they were years at you know you know Alcoholics Anonymous and they were and and and their motto is once a once an addict always an addict that's that's that's AA and see the see the devil always throws something in front of you and it and it looks good but it's always living below your privilege amen and so so so that kept them that kept them from drinking but there was a desire but then one day they came into the presence of the Lord amen they you know they went to a little church where the word was being preached and the desire just left them hallelujah hallelujah amen see God can just take things from youen Hallelujah and then so now and then so he Sanctified just like we are repent and be baptized and we're Sanctified by by the blood of Jesus Christ and then God comes and dwells in us for service amen and then it's the same thing but then the thing is we're still in these Fallen bodies so remember your body is not redeemed yet amen your soul is redeemed this guy still wants to do things this guy I've got to drag him to church I've got to drag him along to listen to the word I've got to drag him along to read the Bible and pray he doesn't want to he's very comfortable Hallelujah because he's not redeemed but I trust there's something in here that is greater than this amen amen and then many times you know you know we may wrestle with things and fight against things many times just say Lord give me a desire that is greater than this desire that's in this thing and and if you do that he'll give you that desire and that desire will become greater Hallelujah you look at people that you know you know they lose incredible amounts of weight one day they had a desire for food and they went down in that direction but then there came a stronger desire in them to lose all that weight and then they lose the weight so so which desire wins the desire to lose the weight it's always the stronger desire will overcome the weaker desire amen amen so then now he fills us with the Holy Spirit I trust you can say I've had that experience my life has never been the same and then but then the thing is it's like at the end of the tribulation the Great Tribulation there's an atomic war amen and then of course we know you know there's the Millennium now in the Millennium there's still sin but it doesn't have an effect upon the Earth because Satan is bound by a chain of circumstance amen but there's still sin but it's bound yeah and then it's after that there's the great white Throne judgment and they're thrown to Lake of Fire and then sin is done away with so it's the same thing with us God comes down and dwells in you and then he takes a chain of his spirit and he binds this thing that it doesn't allow this thing to work anymore yes I am still wrestling well I trust you can look back and say I'm I'm gaining ground every day I'm winning battles things I used to fight against I've got victories and then greater victories and then greater victories what's happening there's a chain being put around oh hallelujah hallelujah so there's a chain of circumstance because the life of God comes into you and then sin can't operate it wants to do you think Satan just wants to sit back and watch the Millennium unfold if he could get his Filthy Hands in that place he would try and destroy it he'd try and destroy you if he could amen he would if he could he'd take your own personality and use it against you in such a way that it would drive you insane yes if he could hey he would he's not a gentleman he doesn't play by the rules he has no respect for anything amen I trust that there's a chain there and then of course now after the after the what you know great white Throne judgment then now there's a holy fire vaporizes burns up the earth the earth is still here but it's burnt off of the Holy Fire that not only the attributes of sin are burnt off but the devils are burnt off as well and then the New Jerusalem comes down and then there's no sin it's the same thing these bodies they need a they need a change they needed a Redemption amen but as as soon as as soon as now these bodies are changed the devil has absolutely no way of even getting a hold of you Hallelujah so remember we're still going to be these bodies are going to be changed amen these atoms are going to be changed same body it's going to be changed amen hallelujah just like the Earth same Earth but it's going to be renovated amen and so he begins to tell us about these things and he begins to paint a picture amen he's putting something remember he's taking scripture cuz all this ministry is is to reveal Christ in here it's not another Bible or some other thing it's revealing Jesus Christ in here amen so so so he begins to paint a picture about what the new heavens and new earth will be like and how we are redeemed in the process of redemption and he's and he's putting that out there because he's wanting you to see this is what you this is what you potentially are this is what you are and this is where you're going amen hallelujah I trust there's something in it when you just think of you think of that place and you know it's not just because you want to escape sin and this life is bad but you want to you want to go to be where he is amen amen amen you want to see him for as he is you just don't want to hear about him or even it's just not enough sometimes we feel his presence you know we may be anywhere in life we may be here but you just feel the presence of God come you feel that sweet humble feeling come over you and you know it's him and you love it and you just long for more of it amen hallelujah and even that because we know there's always more amen amen that's just a little foretaste of what we'll have over there but yet it's the same God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so he begins to project those things he begins to speak about an invisible Union you know you know between Christ and his bride and many people take that as a very hard sermon but he but he's speaking in you know spiritual ways and you know he's throwing something in you know you know before the people you can become one with him you can be United with him you can become as he's the word you become the word I mean the word word becomes one you be you you you become one with Christ and then he begins to say about before the foundation of the world he slipped on a wedding band of unmar predestinated Grace upon your finger Hallelujah what's he doing he's painting a picture for you to step into Hallelujah are you following me I trust I trust this is a blessing cuz it sure blessed me when I was just thinking about he began to paint a picture and then something in us just says yes the voice of my beloved behold he quickly comes Hallelujah now I just want to read I just want to read a quote this is now this is from from that time as brother Bram going into an insane institution to pray for people he says here some time ago I went into an emergency room in a certain building and there was supposed to be um um the insane when I walked in the door there was a lovely pretty young woman about 25 years old sitting there looking at me I said how do you do and some of them in straight jackets and beds um um over their faces and cursing and oh filled with demon power and I looked at her I said well it's kind kindly hard to tell where to start praying first she said if you don't mind I wish you'd start with me I said with you said yes sir I said uh you're not a patient she said I am sir I said well what's wrong with you said uh I suppose I'm insane I said you sure don't look it she said could you listen to my story I said certainly and she said when I was a young girl brother bam I was raised in a real Christian home and I started going with a boy that smoked and said the first thing you know I was smoking and one night he spiked a coke with whiskey and that started me drinking and and she said I started from that to prostitution and she said I lived in the very gutters of the blackest hell she said I served four years in the Catholic institution good Shepherd's home said and there I turned a new page I said when I get out of here I'm going to go straight said I meant it but as soon as I got with the crowd again it was all over then said I did two years in a woman State uh uh Penitentiary here in this state she said there I thought truly I was reformed I come home and joined another church I told the pastor we went down to the Altar and talked it over but she said I just can't keep from it said it started one night I said lady now notice he's going to he's going to project a he's going to paint a picture for her lady don't you want to be a real lady and have a hubby and babies like a real woman was she said oh with all my heart she said but look at me now I said I've tried and tried but you haven't tried my Lord yet she said yes I have too brother brandham I've signed pledges and vows and made promises to God and and I said that's not what I'm talking about I said as oldfashioned it may seem to be it's a devil she said I've always believed that I said he drives you to do things you don't want to do she said I believe that and she said where uh uh would there be a hope for me me certainly and we knelt down to pray and after a while she raised up beautiful woman great soft looking eyes looked up tears running down her cheek she said now brother brandham I believe I'm going to go out and and and make a new life he said this is the grace of God I said sister dear you just simply turning a page I won't it won't do any good I said you've done that so many times I said just stay here until God speaks back to you amen hallelujah we got down there together and prayed and I left her praying went on pray with the other people and after a while she rose up from there and looked around the room those big eyes looking at me she said something happened to me I said now you've got it now you've got it you don't have to turn new pages now it's happened you've got it and from that time she was a changed person person she's married got a lovely home and two children now you and she can point her fingers to a time that something happened to her that was Immortal hallelujah hallelujah see see she said who would you know you know he he paints a picture for her don't you want to be a real woman and have a you know family and all these things and she says with all my heart Hallelujah I mean there's something in people that they just want a real life I mean they just want something that's wholesome and real and but then she said but then who would she says but look at at me now Look at me now and so many time you know she was in her state of despair and maybe you're in that position just now and you would look and you would you know because you read the scriptures and you read the you know you hear the message and brother BR begins to say about how the bride is bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him you know they are one husband and wife or one great is the mystery and you know he's painting a picture of this is this is what the bride is and and and you know sometimes we can look at that then we can look at ourselves but then we would think but look at me now amen who would you know you know why would he take me now I'm in no state for him to take me now but that's not the you know you know you're looking at the wrong thing hallelujah amen you're looking at the wrong thing you got to just look at what he's painting the picture in front of you remember God is not mean he doesn't wave something in front of you and then when you make a mistake gives you a gives you a smack gives you a box law he's not mean like that but he but he puts something in front of you because he wants you to become this this is what I have in my mind for you to become just step into what I have Hallelujah step into what I have for you amen and she said but you know you know but I've tried he said well don't just try and turn over a new Leaf stay there till he speaks to you amen stay there till he speaks to you she got emotion sometimes when we think we get emotional in prayer we've really we've really got through but not all the time amen stay there till he speaks to you amen hallelujah and she amen she was something happened to her that was Immortal amen her in her condition she'd think there's no way someone would want to marry me there's no way I could ever be free of this thing that drives me around as soon as you recognize it's not you that's right you can get rid of it but if you take ownership of it well that's just my nature this is how I've always been you know you the woman at the well thought the same kind of thing and she had you know six husbands she was with another man at that time and she was an outcast in her Village you know the story very well you know you know brother brah repeats it many times because he's wanting he's wanting you to see now this is the kind of people that God is looking for and because she knew more of the Bible than the scribes and Pharisees did because when he be to tell her go get your husband she says I have none and then he begins to discern her life and says that's right you've had five and the one you're wor now is not yours you know she be to recognize this is more than a man standing in front of me and she be to say we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and then so and then so she said he that uh he said to her he that speaks to thee am he and she didn't debate she didn't fuss she didn't say can any good thing come out of Nazareth she just believed what he said dropped her water ran into the village there said come Behold a man come see a man that's told me everything I ever did is this not the very Messiah but yet the scribes and Pharisees they heard the same things they saw the same things being done they were in the meetings amen they were in the meetings but they said this is babab have away with such a fellow and here was the word made flesh and now the voice meant one thing very much to one person and it changed her entire life where she could not break that cycle remember just like this woman something in her was driving her to do things that she didn't want to do it's like you're a prisoner and you're being dragged around do this do this again and you hate yourself for doing it and no doubt she she would lay down at night and maybe she thought she would found happiness with this man but he's different from the other men but she ended up in the same predicament amen and then in the same predicament again and she was driven she was looking for the right thing in the wrong places then finally real husband showed up says I need to go by the way of Samaria and he began to speak words amen never a man spake like this man Hallelujah and it changed her life she never went back to that old life again she went into a new life and brother Bram tells us that the word when it's interpreted when it comes to pass it becomes light amen so when God said in the beginning let there be light it wasn't manifested it wasn't light yet till it actually became light it was just word and then it when it came into manifestation then it was light and Jesus even said to John the Baptist he was a bright and Shining Light and you're willing for a season to walk in his light what was John the Fulfillment of the scripture behold I S before you Elijah the prophet the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord Isaiah I think 40:1 and there somewhere the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was that scripture being made manifest so he was light amen amen and so now and so and so brother bam tells us now when when when Jesus spoke to the woman at the well he said that was light and it redeemed her amen but it blacked out the scribes and Pharisees because down in her was a seed of predestination and when the light came across its path it came to life but the but the scribes and Pharisees all they had was intellectual knowledge they didn't have a seat of predestination so when the light came across their path it just blacked them out completely that's right Hallelujah because one both Heard a Voice but one said that's the voice of my beloved Hallelujah the other said well do away with this Renegade we will not have this man rule over us and he is the word hallelujah now wait let's just go to let's go back to the song of just a little bit again because the scripture as I said in the beginning this Bible is not a book of history and then a moral way of living a moral code but this but the scripture is written in such a way that all the scripture is actually prophesying of today amen you can find where we are in every story in the Bible amen you can you go back into Genesis and then how God when it says let there be light and actually that if you go to the Hebrew it says for light to appear and it's actually now the whole world's covered in darkness and water covers the earth and then he says let there be light in other words let the light appear and then now it's all a separation of the darkness now there's the light then he separates the water from the land brings forth the land and then he brings forth the trees and everything there it's because the seeds if you go read it the seeds of those trees and the all the vegetation they already in the Earth but they just needed for all the stuff to be separated from them that now the light can shine and the life can come forth and that's exactly you amen you are born in this Dark World this is the darkest age has ever been but yet there was a seed down there and God said let the light appear Hallelujah and that's why he said arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee amen hallelujah and so you were here in darkness and and then God callus a separation he said I want that son or daughter to come forth and what they should be amen hallelujah and then the light shine and then try and stop it living try and stop that seed living in you you can run like Paul Paul tried to persecute the church he saw a light he saw stepan oh Steven being stoned that was Jesus being made manifest in his bride and that never left him right amen he was a man under under conviction but light was shining and then he's on the road to Damascus and then the and then the True Light Shone upon him who art thou Lord I am Jesus whom thou persecutest Hallelujah he never Paul was never chasing a pillar you supernatural being I'm going to put you in prison no he was persecuting the true church that Jesus was dwelling in amen and so by persecuting the people that God was dwelling in the body of the Lord he was actually having a go at God Amen that's how much regard that God puts upon you if God dwells in you he's actually saying you're my body amen you're part of me you're not someone who's just coming to church and now have this religion no you're part of the Living God hallelujah you know if someone if someone cut my arm I'd be angry at that well i' pray but I'd be angry at that person I wouldn't trust that person amen but if then if someone if someone maybe had to go at you I would be angry but I might not be as angry because you're not part of you're not might you know I can't feel the same pain as you as as I would I trust this illustration makes sense you see and so God now he sees you as his body amen now so there was light now as I said every scripture and then so we could spend the next forever we can go into David's life we can you know we can go into Ezra and Nehemiah in the time of restoration and this is a time of restoration amen amen you can go you can go everywhere in the scripture and you can actually bring it into the into our day because it's prophesying of our day that's why Paul Paul used to type he was a typologist and he would speak in Hebrews 3 and 4 and he would say about how you're paralleling the Journey of Israel out of Egypt into the promised land speaking it as a Christian journey and he speaks about the same thing even in Corinthians and then Peter would I mean and then he would write to Timothy and it's saying the last days perilous times will come and he comes down he speaks as Jenis and jambus withstood Moses so they of repr probite mind will resist the truth well who's that now then Jenis and jambus with stood Moses they were the magicians that did the same things that same Supernatural signs that Moses did and then so now you can you can go back into that and he's not just getting illustrations and grabbing them and putting them in the scripture he's actually saying those times will live again that's right the people will be different but the spirit remember God and the devil they take the man away but their Spirit remains you take Jesus and Judas Judas Judas went to his place Jesus went into Glory then now the spirit that was in Jesus came and dwelt in the church amen and then John says that the Antichrist has already come the spirit of antichrist he says don't look for it to come it's already here working among you amen so that same same time the Holy Ghost came back the spirit of antichrist came back amen and then you can go to Cain and Abel and that same everything there is being lived out this all the speaks of today amen that's right and it's that's not not farfetched yes that's why that's why you know they speak about in Judas how it speaks about they've gone the way of balum you know you you're on the gain sayings of of Kora well then what happened there balum you know the who knows the story of balum and Moab yeah so Israel is journeying they go through the land of Moab they wanting to go into the promised land Moab the king he knows he can't beat them with his armies because the Israelites defeated other other nations and so he finds a prophet that can curse that can get God to curse them CU he knows if he can get God to curse them then he can have Victory so he hires balum of course God speaks through balum saying I cannot I cannot curse what God has blessed and I have blessed and I cannot reverse my blessing that's God speaking go read numbers 22-25 it's in there and then so they even had even even uh even balum and God um and and Moses they had the same approach to God in terms of sacrifice and the spirit of God was working in the same places it says in there that the spirit of God Came Upon balam and he prophesied three times The Same Spirit that was on Moses Came Upon This false guy who sold his gift for money amen and because he couldn't curse the people he says well just have a feast because you know have a feast because Moab remember you came from lot's daughters and lot so you're related to Israel anyway and so just have a feast and marry together then God will curse them that's exactly what happened then how then and then you come into our day you go back into the Dark Ages what calls the Dark Ages there paganism and Christianity were were United together at the Council of NAA amen that's right and the same thing the same thing you go back into this day the Pentecostals come out of Egypt amen they were remember the church has journeyed as it died remember it died in the days of persecution went down Underground in the in the Dark Ages but then God said I will restore amen amen and then so Luther came forth and it was they had all they had was just shall live by faith amen but that's all they had but then now God was restoring back to the original and then and then so they came out that just shall live by faith and then the wesle we know their their message was sanctification a method of sanctification so they were in the desert and then now the gifts were restored and then so what was happening now is that the Pentecostals now we're going to go into the land and brother bam speaks about this but what happened now is they didn't have the faith that they could do it and they died in the wilderness amen and now what's happened to the Pentecostal Church they've United with the world just like Israel did in the beginning amen and then we can go to David as a rejected King you can just go through all the Old Testament it's all speaking of today amen that's why you can see the things that Nehemiah and isra fought against during a time of restoration we fight against those same things amen David being rejected the things that fought against David we're fighting against the same things Moses the same things amen now where were we Revelations chapter 1 oh no actually sorry we're in Song of Solomon Chapter 2 again then we're going to Revelations chapter 1 now Jesus says in Matthew 24 now see I want to show you here I didn't just pick this cuz it sounds nice wasn't it lovely the voice of my beloved I trust it means more to you than just a nice verse but here we have if we go down now let's just read it again the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fear one come away and then and then and then why ises he saying this foro the winter is passed the rain is over and gone the flowers what comes after winter spring yep spring the flowers appear on the earth the time of singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle which is the turtle do if you look in the Hebrew is heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with tender grape shall be a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one Come Away now let's go to Matthew 24 we just gonna have a little bit of a Bible study just now I'm gonna so I'm going to show you what we've just read is actually prophecy of today yeah just like the Book of Ruth you can go into the Book of Ruth you can I trust you can find yourself in Ruth you go into the Book of Esther exactly the same thing what Esther lived out we're living out what Ruth lived out we're living out you say how can this be it's because Naomi t the you we're going to get there but Naomi types the you know Orthodox Israeli church amen and Ruth is the Gentile is the bride and then so there comes a season where Naomi comes back into her Homeland and then at the same time Naomi comes back into her Homeland Ruth is coming back as well and it's a n you know after the second world war there's a stir and there was a stir before that now is the time we're going to go back into our homeland we we must have a nation again speaking of Israel first time in over 2,000 years we must have a nation what's that Naomi going back to her Homeland amen and then when she comes into her position now that causes Ruth remember our inheritance our homeland has never been a piece of real estate but our homeland is our position in the word amen so as now Naomi is going back into the Homeland into her inheritance then Ruth's Redemption is tied in with Naomi amen so now as n so as Israel's declared we're now a nation God said God comes as the angel of the Lord and speaks to his Prophet says take these two signs of healing to the Nations amen it starts the postor War II healing Revival why is that because now a sign is being done to attract the attention of the people because now the bridegroom is coming to declare himself Amen brother Ram says I would not Point myself to me no way I always appoint you to Christ I appoint you to the word and that's what a true Messenger will do he won't he won't form a following of himself but he points to the people to the word and that's why when you hear the message it reveals Christ in the Bible amen and so so so now Naomi is coming back Ruth is coming back into her position but then now it takes the Gentile to come into her position before Naomi can fully be redeemed that's right amen because he had call the people out the Gentiles for his name yes and what does that mean he will call the people of Gentiles to marry them to be United with them amen amen and then so here's Ruth as a moabitas and now she finds herself in the field of Boaz now I'm just I'm probably saying too much in a very short time but I want you to see that the scripture is not just a story this Bible is not a bunch of stories but it's actually speaking of you it's speaking of Christ in you it's speaking of Redemption all the way down through amen amen it's speaking what the devil did back there he does today and then you can you can say what is the enemy doing in my life go back into the Bible and then if you can identify him there you'll be able to see what he's doing here that's right amen that's why that's why brother R says when the seals are open it it not only reveals Christ but it exposes The Works of the devil all the way down Hallelujah so we're not walking in darkness we know what the enemy is doing but most of all we know what our bridegroom is doing amen amen and so now she comes into the field of Boaz and I know you know the story if not go read it but then now Boaz is a mighty man of wealth he is he is from the lineage of Judah you know and so he redeems Naomi to get Ruth amen so at the cross now he he redeemed Israel to get us that the blessing would go on to us amen and then now but there came a time now where not only that he would pay the price but he would lay claim on Ruth marry her have a child by her and then now the child that son was now given back to Naomi amen what do well what does that mean it means now that when God produces himself in his bride amen as not just gifts not just a part of himself but he'll produce himself a life will be produced amen oh my amen when that life is produced then however it happens that that life will be passed back back to the Jews because the scripture tells us that in one day a whole nation will be born amen that he'll come and they'll say where did you get those wounds he said in the house of my friends and there will be a person apart weeping and wailing recognize they had crucified the Messiah amen but but it's just like Joseph Joseph told his brothers he said you sold me into slavery that life would be saved amen and we can go into the life of Joseph as well and then Joseph went down to Egypt and he married a gentile bride and when she's in the palace and he reveals himself to his Brethren so when we're up at the wedding supper he comes down to Israel and he reveals himself amen it's all being lived out you look why is this world why are the economics of this world falling apart God's in control that's right God caused a famine remember you got to see what's happening and then look into the Bible and you'll see what's happening you'll be able to understand what's going on in your life Life by looking into the word amen amen it's not by trying to work it out in your own mind you got to try and look into the scripture and see cuz there will be a character in The Bible a circumstance in the Bible that you will see yourself in amen and you have to see it that way because if they lived out if they were prophesying of you how they were victorious you'll be victorious amen what what they're fighting against you'll you'll fight against and overcome amen and so now Joseph remember there was a famine there why was the famine there because God had to get Israel back had to get them from there and back from the promised land and had to get them down into Egypt so the economics of the world were falling apart and Joseph actually orchestrated the whole thing that the Egyptians basically ow Nothing by the end of the famine yeah because they ran out of food and then they gave their money they ran out of money then they gave their livestock and then they basically sold their land to him you go read the story so all the economics of the whole world were orchestrated by Joseph amen and that was all done that his his whole family would come down amen into Egypt cuz they had to be there CU there was a prophecy that they had to be there 400 years and then they' be delivered with a mighty hand and go back into the promised land amen I trust I trust you're following me but there's all these things it's not just stories I'm not just trying to say oh I know all these no it's not what it's about but if you can see yourself in character you can see how to overcome amen cuz if they overcame you're sure going to overcome amen amen that's why you delight yourself in the Lord amen cuz you can I'm sure you can see yourself in that scripture and then you can see David overcame and then what you've overcome am amen delight yourself in the law amen amen so Matthew sorry 24 now we read in Song of Solomon the fig tree put forth her green figs and the vines with a tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away it says for the winter has passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth at Springtime now Matthew 24:32 Jesus speaking of the time of the end yeah I'm I'm basically going to put Song of Solomon I'm going to bring it into here amen it's speaking about the same thing now learn a parable of the Fig Tree we just read about a fig tree when his branch is yet tender he putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verely I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled now what well what is the Fig Tre now the safe time we won't read it but go read Jeremiah chapter 24 if you're taking notes he sees a vision of two baskets of figs do you remind us and one is a good one one is a good basket of good figs and the other basket is actually called Naughty figs evil figs and the interpretation of was the basket of good figs they'll all be sent into you know they'll all be taken away into captivity but the Bas of good figs will return again and you go read the chapter because it interprets it I'm not just making this up but then the naughty figs they'll be taken into captivity but then they'll be scattered never return again Jeremiah CH 24 yeah so figs in the scripture is Israel in Prophecy amen and you can even go into Nebuchadnezzar I think it is in Daniel and he is actually referred to as a big tree amen and that's actually speaking of his kingdom yeah are you all following me amen amen and then so now when the Fig Tree puts forth its Branch it's actually when a nation is is growing again you know that summer is night so when an Israeli nation is growing again amen oh haven't we seen that happen Hallelujah you know that summer is night that's what he's saying he's not just Jesus just doesn't throw things out there then you have to guess it interprets itself the word interprets itself and then so when you see that happen you know summer is night what does he speaking of a summer he's speaking of a millennium amen he's speaking of a Redemption he's speaking of you know eventually a new heavens new Earth after that he says so this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled he's not speaking of the generation of of the Apostles there like people you know I picked up a book in wiill one time and they said about failed end of the world prophecies and they took this scripture and said Matthew had a false end time prophecy no they just don't understand what they're reading cuz he says this generation not the generation that Jesus is speaking to there Peter James and John on but the generation that sees Israel become a nation and that's happened amen so now the Song of Solomon what we just read is coming into our day yes I trust it's not just stories I'm so glad it's not just stories amen so now wait let's just go back there Song of Solomon how have done so now the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a roow or a young heart behold he standeth upon our wall he lookth forth at the windows showing himself through the lettuce what's a lettuce you know it's like a you know a lettuce you can't quite see the whole depends how tipe the lettuce is built you can't see the whole picture amen unless you put your eye really through the hole so we see him because we're in the these bodies we don't see him really as he is but when we shall see him we'll be like him the scripture says amen see we've heard of heaven we know God's real because we feel his presence and he's changed our lives amen amen we know that it's not us and our Humanity being Believers but we know it's him in us doing it that's against even what I want in spite of what I wanted in life I'm a Believer well how did that happen I just yielded my will to him and then let him do what he wants to do and so we don't you know we don't see pillars of fire you know in the meeting God's presence like that some people do many don't it's like brother bam in the service he says can't you see that light over that person not everyone could because it was in another realm amen it was in that realm that only a prophet can see but yet we feel his presence it's like a blind man he's never seen the Sun but he feels the sun rais and it takes someone who can see to say that's the the sun affecting you like that and then we may not be able to see him remember these angels here the spirit of God is here all of Heaven is is here in this room Hallelujah just think of it oh I want to see him and he's here amen but we don't he's veiled behind flesh and we can't see the angels in the other realm but they're here amen amen what is that you know you just going through your daily life and just a thought slips into your heart just about him just just out of what is that that's God amen amen so we may not see him and see the Angels but the word tells us angels are here we could say welcome Angels where do you want to sit amen we could cuz the word says they're here but yet we don't see them but yet we feel the effects of the spirit of God hallelujah now that so that's why we're looking through a lettuce we don't see him perfectly as he is amen but when we see him when he fin finishes his coming and we see him then we shall be like him oh hallelujah amen Now Behold so my beloved spake remember God God's relationship with his bride is intimate amen there's something as I said in the beginning there's something about his voice that speaks speaks to you but it's the same thing with husband and wife there's something about your spouse's voice that's very different to every other voice I trust you can say amen I would be talking to Christine on the phone this is when we were just quing and I'd just be crying because there was something in her voice that just moved me this is true Hallelujah that's true there's something in her voice that just moved me like no other woman's voice had moved me amen it's the same thing with the voice of God there's something in the voice of God that moves the bride like only his voice can Hallelujah Hallelujah that's true because God is very intimate amen hallelujah that's why we can say this is a love letter oh my now the flowers appear on the earth So speaking of Springtime and then verse 13 the Fig Tre put forth her green figs and the vines do tender grapes which are good which are a good smell Arise My Love so now now is the season Arise My Love My Fair one and come away Hallelujah so you seeing now when when the Fig Tree put forth his buds now is the time where he says Arise My Love my fear one come away what is that that is the rapture I can't stand it anymore you must Arise My Fair one Hallelujah and then now let's go to Psalms chapter 27 amen I trust you don't mind all the reading but you see it's not when so the song of Solomon it's the voice of the Beloved that moves the bride amen and it causes the bride to come away amen amen and there's something and there'll be something when he when he when the dead in Christ rise these bodies are changed and he calls us up there'll just be something in us that we can't resist it amen amen you you know you won't say oh Lord but what about this you'll say he's called The Master's called I must go Hallelujah there's nothing holding me here hallelujah hallelujah amen now so psalms 27 and we this is very significant this chapter because brother brandom at the end of his ministry when he preaches on the divine order of the Rapture he doesn't go to first Thessalonians 4 first but he opens his sermon with Psalms chapter 27 so and this speaks of the condition of the believer that is ready to go in the Rapture that's right amen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear hallu tell me what can I should I fear this world should I fear the all of Hell amen I got nothing to fear Whom Shall I Fear amen the Lord is the strength of my life he is my he is your strength I can't go on he's your strength amen hallelujah of whom shall I be afraid I lose my job I lose everything don't be afraid amen Don't Be Afraid of Anything Hallelujah when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell now I know I've said this before but there was a time in life when you the enemy came against you just like the woman read about in the quote and we can go to um maybe will in Ephesians chapter 2 and show you but he says he says in Ephesians 2 too but you were you have he quickened yes who are Once Dead in trespasses and sins who used to walk according to the power the prince of the a the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience so he said one time you walked according to the spirit in this world one time you did but he's quickened you that you're no longer under the headship of this world you're under the headship of God himself amen so one time that Spirit drove you did all kinds of things why do people not have peace you see I feel sorry for people like Prince who's gone to his reward other people like if if their lifestyle is so wonderful why are why the vast majority of them have to go through rehab or die of drug overdoses what if it's such a wonderful life why do they end up in that condition amen if it was such a wonderful life they'd never end up in that condition but you see they have no peace they're tormented I feel sorry for them they're slaves amen why did Elvis dive a drug overdose and so many because they were tormented with the because the devil had they have gave themselves to it number one but then now they're in Chains and they dragged through life doing certain things if it was a wonderful life they wouldn't have to try and Escape it by substances and all different kinds of things amen so now so there was a time when the wicked even your enemies Came Upon me eat up your flesh you stumbled and fell there was a time I know there was a time in my life but it's very different now when the life of God comes into you when your enemy comes against you he stumbles on Falls Hallelujah he stumbles on Falls Hallelujah and though host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident Hallelujah I'll be confident in this one thing here's a was confident in one thing he was restoring the kingdom to worship God hallelujah and he had a confidence that God would not let him fall because he was standing for God and to me I love the story because the enemy comes along says look all the places we have we have taken and the Devil comes along and no doubt will come to and say look at all these denominations that we have taken amen look at all these places we've been we've got the Presbyterian we've sure got the Catholic we got everyone under Heaven they're walking in darkness well they being bound to the mother whall I know it's strong words but it's Bible language they are where they like or not and it's not the people it's the system dragging the people there many good people but they just have to come out cuz that's what it says in Revelations 18 come out of her my people and be not partaker of her sins Hallelujah and so the You Know The Enemy can say look at all these places we've been and we've taken every one of them they started off walking in the light but then they made a denomination put God in a box and now they've become a trophy on the devil's wall but then now there's a people hallelujah Jerusalem amen who have stood under the word and they know the devil cannot take them Hallelujah they know the devil has no right to come on their ground Hallelujah and then that's why Hezekiah could stand hallelujah hallelujah amen and that's why Hezekiah could stand and and God he didn't have to fight anything I just came down I'm going to show my power Hallelujah don't be scared if the devil's pinned you into a quarter God wants to show us power God wants to show something in your life to display himself don't be worried Hallelujah of Whom Shall I Fear th host should encamps against me my heart should not fear that war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple we know that does the house of the Lord doesn't mean this building amen it means going into the holy of holies becoming one with him amen for in the time of trouble and it sure is a time of trouble he should hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and then Jesus said to the disciples Upon This Rock I'll build my church and if you read the chapter the rock is not Jesus the rock is not Peter the rock of is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed this to thee but my Father in Heaven has revealed it what was it Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Upon This Rock the spiritual revelation of who Jesus is in his season amen that is the rock everyone can say Jesus died on Calvary that's just a historical fact but when God comes upon the scene in your generation you have to see him as he is amen that's been the challenge all the way down through why would it be different now Paul even wrote them that are spiritual among you let them acknowledge that the Commandments I teach you are the Commandments of the Lord there was a challenge now all we believe in Jesus we know the holy spirit's come but what's these letters Paul are writing yes they had to actually acknowledge God was using Paul to lay Place Christ and Grace and all these different things positionally place the Bible yes amen they had to acknowledge it and all the way down has to be the same thing amen you know you know the scribes and Pharisees they said we are Moses disciples and Jesus said if you had known Moses you'd know me CU because Moses wrote Of Me amen but they didn't know Moses they recognize the one Moses was writing about so this rock is always the revelation of Jesus Christ in the season that the people are alive in amen I trust that's not too that well we'll come to that later and now shall my head be lifted up actually I'll just mention it now at the end of the church Ages Every Church age Revelations 2 and three to him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit speaks not has spoken but speaks to the churches amen so God is speaking through every age from Calvary down to now God is speaking and him that has an ear amen oh Hallelujah him that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is speaking but we understand that the truth true voice of God will not deviate from the work that's right amen and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing y sing praises unto the Lord now here oh God when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me now listen when thou sest seek ye my face arise remember arise my fear and come away seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek there's something in The Believer when God speaks to them it's actually the remember the heart is the is the seat of the affections as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so it's not in here it's in here something in here responds back to his voice and says your face Lord will I seek yes I me so when he speaks the you know when the voice of my of of your beloved comes your way there's something in here that responds Hallelujah that's why it's an intimate walk it's not a just a head knowledge thing Hallelujah hide not thy face far from me put not thy uh servant away in Anger thou Hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother for uh uh forsake me then the Lord will take me up and if you forsake father and mother for my sake I'll give you father mother husband land you know as teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in the plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of my enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord you see this is a time of trouble we are not comfortable in this world right God doesn't want us comfortable if you've ever wondered why is the world falling apart because he wants us to anything holding us here he wants to break it free now that doesn't mean quit your job live in the hills and make a monastery I'm not talking about that we're in this world world but we're not of the of this world Amen so he's he's speaking here so so notice I want to just get to that verse mainly in verse eight seeky my when when thou said seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek because it's now the voice means more the voice of God to the believer means more to the believer than than than anything that's right amen amen hallelujah now we got to Revelations chapter 1 and then we'll I'm sorry time has slipped away now John I'm just going to drop this in but John let's just read from verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things was must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear a record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now I want to okay let's let's just drop down well actually let's just keep reading John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they which also pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen now remember this this every eye shall see that's not the Rapture because he comes like a thief of the night and a bad thief causes everyone to see him amen but he says I'll come like a thief of the night so this is not when he comes for his bride this is when he comes to Israel amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is which was and which shall to come the almighty and I John who who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ now I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me as a great voice as of a trumpet now John this book The Book of Revelation is a book of Prophecy which we've also read and then it's also a book of symbols that's right yeah because he he has told what you see so this is verse 19 write the things which thou H has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter and he's told to write it oh sorry verse 11 saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeth write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia remember those churches in Asia are Gentile churches in the southwestern part of of turkey there not so it's not it's not addressed to the churches in Jerusalem the Israel uh the Jewish churches it's speaking to Gentiles so John so what you see WR in a book so when he sees a horse rider or he sees something that's what he sees and he writes it down so it's a book of Prophecy but it's also symbolic but now John says John in verse 10 says I in the spirit on the Lord's day now the Lord's day is not Sunday amen but we gather on Sunday because it was the day after the Sabbath Jesus arose just to honor the resurrection but the Lord's day is not a Sunday the Lord's day is after the church ages are over amen so so it's during the Great Tribulation that is the day of the Lord because if you read about Jacob's trouble and all the other Prophecies of the day of the Lord it's a great day of Vengeance of our God it's when his wrath is poured out that is the day of the Lord that's after the church is raptured that is the day of the Lord and so so so John so John's there on Patmos but he's actually been transported into the day of the Lord amen by vision and then I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet so then now we're not you know read the whole thing but just the same time so here's John here's John and he he's a on the Lord's day and he hears a great voice behind him as a trumpet so he turns around because the voice is behind him and then he sees one standing in the midst of the golden um uh in the midst of the seven candlesticks that's that's verse 13 so he turns around and he sees one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and that seven golden candlesticks or actually lampstands they are the seven speak of the seven churches which are periods of time from Calvary to now so John and I'm not sure how I'm going to get it uh uh wind this up but so John is here in the Lord's day he turns around and he sees the son of man Christ glorified in the midst of the Gentile churches which is the church ages so now John is here but then he turns around and he now he begins to tell and see what God has been doing from Calvary into where he is yeah so John now John is not where when when John is recorded in the Book of Revelation he's not speaking of himself but he is a symbol amen he is symbolic of a group of people and I'll show you that in a second so now here's a group of people that are at the end of the end of the church ages and what happens at the end of the church age there's a voice of my beloved says behold my my fair one come away amen there's a Rapture takes place that's right I mean so they hear a voice arise my fear one come away so he's there now basically you are John in the Book of Revelation go tell John amen amen you are John in the Book of Revelation and then so now you are there and then he shows you in the Book of Revelation what he has been doing for seven Church ages amen that's why that's why he's here and he hear a voice behind him that's unusual because normally the angel appears in front of a person normally if you go talk to someone you you you you look them in the face hey you don't nor come behind them say Hey you know but it's because John is actually in in time but a future event from where he is and then so he's called now and he looks and he sees Christ among the seven churches and then now the Book of Revelation is he God begins to show John this is what I've been doing and now so he's showing you remember the I I wanted to bring this out because remember this is not many people think Old Testament History New Testament moral code book of Revelation scary I don't know that's normally it but this book is a special book amen because it tells where you're going and where you're from where the devil's going and where he's going where he's from and he's well he's he's going to leg of fire anyway that's what I mean you know and so God's written this in such a way remember the voice of God is special to the bride it's a very special thing and so now John now God Jesus Remember The Book of Revelation is not the revelation of John the Divine like I have in my Bible cuz chapter one says the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right so it is actually the only book in the scripture that Jesus actually writes but through a scribe amen so now he is called so he sees that now and then he begins to detail through the church ages what the true church has been doing and what the false church has been doing and then now there comes if you come to the end of let just go to Revelations 4:1 and then we'll wind this up he's here now and he says after this what's after what the seven Church ages he's just seen after this I looked and behold the door was open and Heaven and the first voice which I heard as it were a trumpet talking with me said come up hither and I'll show you these things which must be hereafter so that voice that he heard behind him and he looks now that same voice speaks from Heaven saying come up hither and what is that that is the rapture of the bride at the end of the ages amen so it is the voice so so God is saying so God puts emphasis now on the voice the voice that spoke to me amen because the voice that spoke to John was very important to John amen so now we're here you're John you're John in the scripture now I don't think this is going too far but if you go to the end of Book of Revelation John fell down to worship the angel revealing the truth yeah that's what and he says don't worship me I'm one of your fellow Brethren the prophets okay so what it is now is actually a prophet revealing things to John of of what has been what is and what shall come amen and then at the end of it he falls down to worship he says no I'm not because the word angel in the scripture means messenger amen Galatians I think 4:14 Paul says you receive me even as an angel of God a messenger of God so it's not necessar an Angelic being I could say even this morning I am an angel because I'm bringing a message amen someone who's written a song and preaching through song they are an angel cuz they're bringing a message amen amen so now so so this Angel is speaking to John as a prophet and then now when you go into the message and and and then when when like in the Book of Revelation it says about the new heavens and new earth it actually says about the angel says come and see and so and and there's more than one place where the angel says come and see this and he showed John certain things and then when you go into the message now brother Brown speaks on the new heaven and new earth amen and then he reveals everything that that that that is spoken of in the Book of Revelation the angel says come and see the same things brother BR preaches on am remember I'm trying to make this book a lot more personal because it is a lot more personal oh that's just a bit up here no it's not because if there's a prophet at the end of the ages that reveals the truth then not only will his ministry be in the scripture but you'll be in the scripture and there's certain reasons why remember Jesus Jesus every day of jesus' life was Ed so it was predestinated that he'd go here he'd say this here he'd go here he'd say this here he'd go this say this here just like Paul's Journey as as the New Testament was unfolding to Paul it was an ordered Revelation by God the same thing with Moses Moses received the law on the you you know Mount Si but then God Contin tells Moses and Moses say thus sayth the Lord when you do this do this and this needs to happen when you do this and they're off the mountain amen they're not not there the whole time and so God is re unveiling more of himself as they're walking with God that's right amen this is not oh this is just adding no it's not Paul when Paul started preaching he didn't preach the book of Ephesians amen he was writing different Epistles and then the word was opening to Paul as he was walking with God just like Isaiah or Jeremiah or any of the prophets they didn't get their whole Revelation then slowly drip feeded out to the people what God revealed to them that's what they told yes amen amen and then so we come to this final age and then it's actually and then this is why you'll see I trust you can see yourself in the Book of Revelation where because John one man in a one man is a symbol as a whole people amen come up hither that's the Rapture of the church you see John as a as as a man is a symbol of you amen and it's the voice actually directs him to what he's seeing and doing amen you can see the same thing in Revelations 10 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go take the little book and eat it become one with the become one with Christ amen so it's the voice that's guiding him as he walks and it's because there's something in the voice of God that's why I've been saying these whole things I trust it means something to you there's something in The Believer when they hear the voice of God Amen it speaks them like only he can and that transcends to me that transcends well I understand this and this is where I'm at in life this is what I know the Bible to be amen but if there's something in you the voice of my beloved how how how does he become a beloved because someone tells you no because you fall in love with him amen you you enter into a love relationship with him and that and because he is your beloved as I said maybe a couple of Sundays ago you just give yourself to him and your whole walk with him and how you live is because you love him he's my beloved's voice you know he is he is my beloved my beloved is mine and I am his and his Banner Over Me Is Love Hallelujah amen maybe we'll just leave it there forgive me but we have some musicians but I trust I trust you personally he is your beloved amen there's just something when you think about him because remember you say well we shouldn't go by emotion anything without emotion is dead amen anything without emotion you see them on the book of you know you read about the Church of the book of Acts this is not see this is how many people think it would be in modern churches or maybe more older churches and the spirit of the Lord sound of a Russian Mighty Wind came in Acts chapter 2 sound of Russian Mighty Wind and then clovered tongues of fire appeared on all of them this is how some Churches would be and they all said amen and they walked out very sensibly and well that's how many people are but something happened to them that was like a house on fire and a windy day they were so happy and rejoicing because this was that spoken by the prophet Joel amen and you see it all the way down through now we don't just go on emotion but if you know it's like if I didn't love my wife and have feelings for her when I think about her when I see her then there's something wrong with our relationship that's right I mean if it was just all Form and Function now Mrs glin here this this is what we'll do today and all very a good amen there's something very wrong amen and it's like the believer in Christ if it's all form and functioning well Lord I'll say my prayers and say the same kind of prayer and then I'll read my maybe one chapter or some memory verse a day and I'll go to church and I'll walk out for the rest of the week and I'm in there's something wrong am amen that's that's why and what was the complaint against the Ephesian Church you have left your first love you got to read it acts chapter I mean um Revelations 2 so there should be something in you that when you hear the voice of God it should move you like only it can amen more than anything else and if it doesn't move you like other things then you should pray Lord give me a desire that is for you and your word that is stronger than this desire that's causing me to be away from your word amen amen that's all you need to do hallelujah amen amen uh I wanted to sing living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away can we sing that do we have the chords is this all right no let's just wing it would you like all stand with [Music] me amen I just wanted to sing the song all day we have a projector okay we warm up but you know what I mean there should be a love in you you say well I don't really have that desire say God give me a desire give me a burden give me a love one day when heaven was filled with his Praises one day
