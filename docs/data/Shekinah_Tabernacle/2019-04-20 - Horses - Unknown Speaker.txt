to dwell on your kingdom going to be to be a part of your almighty kingdom Lord and may we find our place in your kingdom Lord and dwell in harmony with you yes Lord may we not wrestle against you in

and you came down to become one of us it's Lord to pay the price of our sins Lord you became us that we might become like you Lord Jesus you left all your glory Lord and you you died the most cruelest death that there was not because you had to Lord but because you knew that it was the only way that we would receive salvation what it was the only way for us Lord Jesus and we what we want to give you praise and glory for that Lord we just thank you for this time we can remember not that we set it aside for a certain weekend of the year Lord Jesus because we were always grateful of what you've done for us Lord but and this time when we recognized Lord that there was a time when you died it was a time and in relation to our time of here on earth thought there was a time when you died Lord and then there was a time when you rose again Lord Jesus and today Lord is the resurrection day Lord when different ones went to find you in the tomb Lord and they got a report saying he's not here

god bless you or you can take your seats this morning I mean Thank You musicians thank you brother James I mean we've got smaller working group here this morning to kind of operate all the different things but by the grace of God at all works amen amen okay am i coming through okay we all working yeah good okay crazily how is everyone doing this morning good feels like a nice um like a little family environment this morning nice and like we can all be quite a place you know you can sort of move up to the front and maybe you can sit in the seat there you wouldn't otherwise get to sit in think about that you know when you when when there's just a regular church so ever seen the regular people come they kind of have beer you know that's their spot it's not really bare spot but they always go and sit in that spot so you can't really take that spot maybe when a visitor comes they don't know who's the spot is and they go a certain someone else's spot and then the other person thinks oh there's someone in my spot but it's not really this one but you're at Liberty today to take the spot you've always wanted to take but someone else is being here apart from like the regulars like you know this seat here is taken but I saw you there before in the front was that you Shannon with you I'm not a narc I must okay prays a little bit um it doesn't really matter about these things really does that that's just a human that's a human thing that we do humans operate a certain way and they kind of we're creatures of habit you know we just have actually do things a certain way I always try and change it like I'm a regular at the subway and um Rima Tucker and I always go there and get like a coffee in a subway and after about a month of getting the same thing like every second morning they they they they say to me their usual and I'm like that now that let's change it and then you know I'll mix it up just to advise you feel like you're stuck in a rut you know if you you reckon if you're doing if you're just doing the same thing you feel like you feel like you're getting old and like you know this but we're not getting old we're actually getting younger our spirits are getting younger you know the more we receive Christ into our life the more younger our spirit becomes we don't Christians don't get old their body just as telling you lies because it's not getting old their spirits wherever I have them are freshly like a five year old they've got the enthusiasm towards life of a five year old I love little children they're so positive towards life you know they're so excited about things you know you you say we're going to go to the park and yes if you had a cent you know we we don't get as excited when we get older but unless we're a Christian we do we get excited about waking up and doing life amen praise the Lord okay I've got a I've got a funny thought here this morning it's not so much of an Easter message because last week brother Ben said he'll preach the eastern message okay so he took Easter last week so okay so this week the you know my story I'm just like the spare tire sort of ministry when brothers go they they get the answer you know that after the new modern cars have those little biscuit tires on them the small ones that are not really designed as a spare tire and they're designed to you put the thing on and you drive 40 kilometres from there to the nearest station to get a change you know that's the not like the old days the spare tire was as good as the new tire you know you could it didn't matter if you had the spear or the new tire on it was all the same you could you know go for it but so I'm one of those little spare tires but the thought that I've had this morning as a thought called horses s I just get this little seems to do it that way I had this funny of this thought of horses so I've just been looking into the subject of horses has been okay it's been add quite an interesting little subject for me to look into and I think I always get more out of the subject then maybe you guys do because I research it look into it and I get a lot out and I hope that you'll be blessed in a way from this okay we're going here David we got one last little technical hurdle to get over and then we've had a successful run is that I'm see if this guy you see if these are the batteries man I think these um they are triple A's who's had a good week had a good week praise the Lord we're gonna we'll stand up this morning we'll just read the verse bring the next one up Dave well they're getting that ready okay the scripture I've got which is not overly related to the topic and yet it's just one about horses that I I like and it's probably to me the scripture is a very balancing scripture in my own life if you're dealing in natural and spiritual things I like this scripture here and it's proverbs 21 verse 31 and it says the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the Lord you know like this in our in our natural life there's certain things that we have to you know we do and we think we arrange things and that but you know we've got to make sure we keep in context all the time that that it doesn't matter what we can do or how well we think we've got things arranged and everything's going to work out all right it's not really the case we prepare these things in our life we get things ready and we think we've got things organized but you know safety is of the Lord if we think our we've prepared all this therefore everything's going to be all right that's wrong we prepare these things but safety is of the Lord the overall victory is because of the Lord not because of anything not because we've prepared everything to go well okay let's try that one again okay we might have right it's all you Dave okay let's just pray this morning once more Lord we just thank you for your word Lord and we just thank you Lord we thank you for how you pre-ordained all things Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world Lord and we just commit this thought to you we've come at your word Lord to you and we just pray you take full control of the service in Jesus name Amen Rob this you can take your seats again this morning when I do that you go yeah okay stay on here so now horses who likes horses amazing creatures they're horses they're such great graceful animals and I thought I'll get some pictures of horses up here and I could probably look at pictures of horses all day they're just so nice to look at like they're so well designed the Lord's design this amazing creature it looks like it just looks beautiful these ones here running horses they just have some sort of like a graceful element to them of horse another one and if they're running it's always better a and like and the water you see there what is going up like we would run through water and not look as good as a horse well like imagine a sheep running through water you know or a cow wouldn't look as gracious as a horse like a giraffe but a horse just has a it's got a presence about it you know it's been it's a design of God that's been designed in a special way you know just it's got this something about it and it's actually been designed with humans and mind I more so than I think any other creature like when God made a giraffe or an elephant he wasn't really thinking you know they're gonna be a real buddy of me and although people do have drafts and they write elephants in that but there's creatures like a like a horse or like a dog that kind of have been in a way maybe even a cat but I'm not too fond of cats but they've been designed with people in mind you know I think God had people in Rome and he designed a horse he had people in mind he didn't just have our this thing we just go unnoticed like a skank you know that all these funny little creatures you know they don't really have much of a bond but horses horses have a bond they've just got something special about them and I think after doing this and you're looking at the horses for a week I kind of get to like horses I think I must get me a horse one day by the end of it yeah I like this one doesn't he look amazing he's just but you wonder what he's thinking sometimes they what's that horse thinking they portray this idea of what they're thinking but and I think they're actually portray they're thinking what they're portraying but I'll show you that later on okay so so now about two summers ago two Christmases ago something happened to me at Christmas time I became a cowboy so I was given this authentic american-made cowboy hat for Christmas and I became a UH that was me I was a real cowboy who's wanted to be like a cowboy you watch little all the boys like yeah you know you're watched when you're young you watch cowboy movies you think man I'm gonna be a cowboy and I'm big but most of us never quite get the array but we we just hang on all the way through life we're gonna be a cowboy one day you boys are still got hope man you're young you can do it but I finally got there when I got this hat you know so I became is that what makes you a cowboy there's a few little like minor details like that I don't that I lack like horse saddle boots Spurs pistol workless ooh cows any sort of horse riding experience or any sort of farm job hey but aside from all those minor details we'll call them I'm actually I'm a cowboy I've made it because I've got the Hat hey the real head and as a result because this sort of cowboy you know runs in the family all my children are now you know they're all cowboys and cowgirls too so we've got a real strong family tradition of you know so if you wonder where I'll get my authority to speak on these things about horses it's because I'm quite clearly a horse person right but well but luckily luckily somebody in the family we finally made it someone in the family finally actually managed to get their hands on a horse which was my daughter Hannah we actually prayed that the Lord would provide a horse and the Lord provided this horse here for Hannah so she's actually so we're kind of our where we're us it's within grasp now this whole cowboy thing as long as I can that right-handers horse so Hannah's got this this little horse here I think I'm pushing the button but I'm not so now now this is where the thought comes from this idea of horses so so here's his Hannah's horse called our Missy right just and the paddock in there a landlord which lives over the back we were talking to him about horses and his wife as a quite a good horse rider she's done horses all her life in and we got talking about the horse and we were looking at the horse and this picture here and we asked ourselves one question which would which is maybe not a question usually asked but when you ask it it's kind of obvious you think why didn't I think of that question before why don't houses do that and the question that we wondered was why doesn't the horse just jump over the fence and go wherever it wants to go have you ever thought that about a horse my horses can jump most horses and most of the fences that get built and not like a deer fence like if you see a paddock with deer and they've got to build these fences you know as high as the wall there because the deer will just jump over the fence they have this nature they just jump jump you don't get away get away even tame deer will just jump over fences but horses you'll build a fence this way and they were just 90% of the time now there are there are exceptions but and as a general rule horses will just stay in the paddock they just even if they're a show jumper like it and they're used to jumping six foot high fences he'll just they won't jump this fence and and he said you know it's a funny thing with horses they're horses they they're actually they're actually quite lazy and I read you a quote from a horse person they've generally a they're quite lazy but B they don't really have a strong willed to do things like that in the if so and this a rider gets on the back and says through this go and jump that fence and and enforces that's well upon the horse the horse burn it just says hey why put effort in to try and jump the fence it doesn't have enough will to jump the fence therefore we just stand the paddock it's made that way it's not it's well as designed that it unless you really tell it to it doesn't want to go and jump this fence that's how a horse is designed it's a very it's like a servant type of an animal we're in this it gets told to do something and put an effort and it will just sit back and actually quite lazy I'll read this so this is actually from a horse person to to explain what I mean and it it sums up reason they'll be ok so this lady says horses are naturally pretty lazy animals and this they have a really good reason they won't see a need to jump out of their enclosure now here's the small proportion that that do of course this doesn't apply to every horses if your horse some horses just really want to be with your buddies and work very hot past your fences other horses see many jump him for no reason but actually these horses aren't the Grand Prix jumpers horses that are trained to jump big are trained to listen to their riders if the rider isn't telling them to use all the energy and jump over the fence why bother it's like someone asking you to run cross-country 50 miles or 100 kilometres at a run some people would do this just because they love it but most people wouldn't go anywhere near it and this it was some big prize at the end right it's the same so you're saying it's the same with horses though so now we begin to you understand the concept of horses they're as it's powerful and strong as they are they've got so much energy harnessed inside them that that is and they're such fearless animals and yet they're actually quite lazy at the same time and this someone harnesses their energy and makes them go forward and use it they just won't use it they will just you know oftentimes you walk part yeah when do you when do you see a horse and a paddock running around and when you see it standing most of the time you just see them standing there right now and then you'll see them gallop but they generally just stand around now there's a reason why I want to show you this because this is a first type that I want to get into so is anyone know this song I'm not gonna base my doctrine on a song but this is a concept do you never know the song there's something within me got a hold of the reins no uhit's just a Christine would not if she was here she knows all the old songs so this may be these some of these songs were written back and like if you take back a while ago when a lot of people would sail on ships you know then a lot of the songs were about ships and you know going into new lands and and the wind blowing and storms in it because men and women were used to going on ships and so that was how they talked a lot of these songs but but there are a lot of songs about the rains you know likes Jesus the Lord taking the reins of our heart you know that something's got a hold of the reins and typing us to a horse cuz these people would have rented a lot of horses and they understand you know I control this horse and I take it where I wanted to go therefore I want to be the same with the Lord he can take the reins of my heart and direct me where that I want to go so this is actually quite a nice loooong maybe we'll introduce it to the church one day right but now so I want to type the first thought about a horse as that and the type of you and I we're actually we are quite you know we've got a lot in us we've got a lot of talents we've got a lot of ability to do things but you know we're actually I'm not going to say we don't do anything but we're actually quite lazy and we won't really do much right we just sort of sit around but I'll let you know that when we get to a certain age no one remains unbroken you know you get a broken wild horse that does its thing nobody in this world remains unbroken no-one's a wild horse free spirit of no one's riding me and I know every horse gets broken by somebody something right that's why there's so much turmoil in a teenager's life far beyond that time because here's this horse that's coming to the age of accountability in a sense someone wants to hop on that horse and use it for themselves to write it use all the use someone wants to use the talents that that person's got they want to use the energy they've got they want to use their abilities and this this is God or Satan as after that to take control of that horse and that's what's that's what happens in in and out in our lives someone once someone is going to break us in and write us now we may change riders later and we might get this Satan and then later on we think they would know we don't want you and we let the Lord come and take control but only you know in every person's life somebody has got the reins of your heart and is riding you we say well I'm my own person I control my own thoughts every thought you have was given by somebody whether it be the Word of God or Satan's thoughts we're governed by thoughts and those thoughts of the reins that guide our life because it's thoughts that guide our life and God's Word is just a thought we read on a paper but it's just his thought and it's taking that thought in our mind and letting that thought Gladys net thought will guide us through life and the spirit that is associated with that thought will guide us through life therefore it's the same with satan's thoughts what you're anti God they say you can do this and do these other things the negative things and the same spirit that gives those sorts will also guide you it's this so I've got the scripture here just to explain about a horse at some 32:9 SBE not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding that's us whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle s that come nigh unto thee now I don't want to downplay what humans are but we all know that's the truth now we get type like sheep all are like sheep have gone astray you know God doesn't really give us much wisdom B says has any lack wisdom let him ask of me and I'll give them wisdom you know so now we can become wiser than that but it's only by the wisdom that God gives us and ourselves that we're left to ourselves where do we garner wisdom from you know where do we gather it from so the scripture here is what I wanted to which which portrays the the type of a horse Romans 6:16 says know you're not there to whom he yield yourselves servants to be his servants he are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness see so he's saying whichever person you let ride you and control you that's the best that's their going to take you where they want to go I go where I want to you know you don't you get led we get lit around and you know and and we've got so much energy within us to do things right we've got a lot of energy we're actually very powerful creatures and God uses man and soda Satan because we've got powerful ability to go and do things but same as a horse a horse is very powerful but you see even in the paddock myself but just stand there not won't do anything you get a writer get on that horse and say right this is what we're going to do that horse will go day in day out day in day out we can week at year in year out for that writer doing whatever the writer since brought to do now and I want to say this Christians aren't the only ones that do great things non-christians do as well but they're because someone's using the energy their talent to do a great thing for him for his kingdom and and the Christian lets God come and control us and use our talents use our skills use everything that we've got for his kingdom use the strength that we have and I've got a few stories about some horses just to just to type like you know maybe see yourself in the picture or just to get just to get the example that these horses that we're going to talk about generally if they didn't do this they would have been sitting in a paddock somewhere doing nothing and they didn't actually choose one day right I'm gonna go out and do this thing someone came up to them and said right I want to take you and we're gonna go and do this and I think I like conflict stories because they and times of conflict that seems to bring out something in people that it brings out quite strong situations yeah this one no wars are nice I don't agree with wars whatsoever I think there I'm glad and hearing there be no wars cuz Wars cause so much trouble down the line so much pain for generations and generations our war causes but for this story this is the actually the Korean War this is in the fifties and so so these these um these guys they they were using these certain these sort of guns and they took they took big um rounds of ammunition and these guns were up on hills cuz they would shoot across to the enemy on the other side and the the Americans had a big job of getting these big bullets ammunition things up to where there where the guns were and I guess one soldier could maybe take one of these things and he'd have to walk it all the way up and come back down take another one up because they were very heavy so they thought okay this is too much work for us and it's slow process and we're using a lot of resource getting these these guys these things up here so they so they said right let's hit with one a guy came up with an idea to just go and buy a horse and we'll just we'll train this horse to bring this ammunition so they're gonna they were going to strap these um we're just gonna call them big bullets right we're gonna strap them onto the what do you call them rounds yeah there must be a name haven't been in the army so don't know big bullets and so this horse could get four or six of these things on it so so they stake they got this horse and they started training this horse to to have the pack settle on it and you know run this ammunition but they were training the horse that when it heard a when it heard a big shot it would go down and you know get down into a bunker and different things and the soldiers with the humor their head they they called it hoof camp you know say we humans have boot camp so they said we're gonna take the horse through hoof camp okay so they they trained this horse excellent and and and this horse would go a few kilometers with this with these this ammunition on his back and go to the the wherever the gun wasn't come back and and this horse would do this all day they said they trained this horse to to firstly to not worry about the the gun fire what after a few times of a lot of explosions the horse would there'll be explosions all around and the horse would just be rummaging through the the soldiers bags trying to find some food you know after a while but this horse formed quite a bond with these soldiers and that the soldiers they all like the source after a while before they sent it out and it would it would just have free reign within the camp you know they could just go through round the camp and the soldiers would feed it all their rations all the time there'd of a feed coke and feed it lollies and feed all these things and it would go and sleep on whichever team that wanted to sleep in we just walk in a tent sleep in there one day I think it one guy had all these some speech the thing that his family has sent over some spiritual lolly had a big beggar than the source just eight haulers lottie's but but they treated this horse well there's a lesson in that these soldiers treated it well it was a no one was allowed to ride it that was a it was one of the buddies you know and they weren't to just must treat it they would you know if it wanted food they give it food and it just had free rein within the camp and they all like the source it's probably as biggest achievement was firstly what they what they would do is they would take the horse and show it once weird had to go and then come back and once it knew the way once then it would just do it by itself all day walking back and forth all day one day it made 51 trips back and forth during a three-day battle and one day it made 51 trips back and forth to this this some gun and it would carry ammunition up and then they would strap winded soldiers on ass back and it would carry them back down and it made 51 trips back and forth all day this horse went back and forth in it it had obviously helped the army to keep shooting and then it brought back wounded soldiers and they this sauce over its course of a Slifer got promotions its name was sergeant reckless then I think it got corporal sergeant or it sort of they they did special ceremonies for the source but I think these guys meant it they like hey man this horse was actually he he fought as hard as we did you know he helped us and then win the war furnace they wanted to get it back to America and they had to fill out a lot of paperwork to do so and then they they put it on the list of goods to go onto a ship and and then when they got to the ship the captain of the ship see there's no way that horses coming on here because his ship had just won the cleanest ship for two years in a row he see there's no way the horse is coming in their shed and unless they said you signed for it horse and all its belongings but it was called sergeant reckless he obviously didn't read all the fine print so he had to take on the sauce and it actually vomited all over his dick but but then it then a winner went back to America they just let it retire and they they were feeding it goodies but I think the vet said oh only one cup of coke per day for the source because it was yeah so that horse would have just been sitting somewhere doing nothing right but and it didn't actually want to go and do all those things that didn't say I want to do that but it but someone came up to it and said I'll take that horse and and and let's go and do this thing and then as a result that horse did all these things that's the same in our life we don't decide I'll go and do these things the Lord comes to us and says this is what we're gonna go and do I've got one more this this is Gallipoli World War one now they these next one so this it was a horse called Bell and this was an Australian horse and he tracked the time back in Australia this horse was a very fiery horse and nobody could ride it so in one of the I guess the drafting stations where guys would come to sign up to go to the war they would use this horse to test out each person's horse riding skills I say you say can rode a horse all right um bring out bill and they would ride try and try and ride bill you know and if they could sort of stay on there for 30 seconds it was okay one guy stayed on there for two minutes they said yet you've you're you can come with us they found that later he was 14 he's 14 year old boy saying they were growing him in but that was the longest anyone had stayed on the source for was two minutes they just he was a strong world he wouldn't let anybody ride to him you couldn't tame him he was just he was just angry and didn't like anyone but he was a really strong horse he looked strong and I think that's what kept every when these guys keeping him they thought well if nothing else he'll just be a pack horse you know we'll load things on them he'll go up and down and that's what we use them for cuz nobody can ride him so so that's what they did an Engel up early and World War one they had hundreds thousands and thousands of horses that they use all around the place and so a place like Gallipoli would be a horse would just can't supplies up the hill and come back down and and this horse was very strong and it would just do this all day and while they were there about seven kilometers away there was a maybe the the where the British were and they had to get news back and forth to tell them let them know Heather there's another camp to let them know how the war if it was going because it was before they had radio shows either a pigeon or a horse rider so but sometimes they would need to bring mail letters back and forth and it was probably letters for the soldiers as well but they would come to this other camp and then they would have a guy write on a horse to the main camp and the soldiers would always put bits on you know if the soldier would be shot on his way there or not because that the enemy tooks will be at the top and they would be shooting at the sky running along the beach yeah with the horse and that was always the bit will he make it will he not so they wager on if the guys going to make it through but one British quite a well quite a good horse rider he for some reason these guys all wanted to ride the horse to take the mail through you know risk getting shot but they they all sort of you know through the name out of the Hat yes I'm the guy that gets the ride and bring the mail I wouldn't want to do that if you know half the guys get shot but that's what they did and then so they said right you can ride bill as well because they just thought you know and so when people who heard they are riding bill this guy was gonna ride bill and he thought he could do it cause he was a you know good jockey they made a bit will he will the ride a tune up there will the horse and rider tune up there or will just the horse tune up there you know there was what they see with this one with Bill and sure enough after a while the horse chucked the guy off but then he carried on to the station so the mal got three but the guy unfortunetely didn't make it they say when he got to the station he the horse got shot along the way and and yet there was a um there was a guy there and he'd heard about this horse and had and didn't like anyone or anything like that but but he you know this guy started to he befriended the horse and he started going to it and bring it little treats and just being nice to it he was he was a they call him now a horse whisperer because back then I think people would just must treat the horses a bit but he started being real nice to the source and bring it treats and go and visit it and looked after its wounds and over time this horse learned to trust this man and so much so that after a while he would let this men right on him but nobody else if he no-nos tried to hop on bill he'd kick them off but as soon as this man did he could he could ride him and I think that's the way the Lord does it with us and even the most stubborn angry strong-willed people you know the Lord's got away - well his unconditional love to reach down and touch our hearts you know till we're even the even the most strongest strong world of people will submit to the Lord that's how the Lord can do it so now this man had convinced they would go from Gallipoli over to Egypt and they were going to fight in the and the campaign there and so this man was going there - and he asked if he could take bill on that campaign with him and so he was able to take bill on that campaign and this was the one where the light horsemen Australian light horsemen took Beersheba which was essentially the start of Israel coming back - to the children of Israel because the British got it then they gave it to Israel so the the that was the last major campaign but bill didn't write a net campaign he wrote in another campaign but they would essentially line up on their horses and make a charge on guns and you know hopefully they get they get to the place before they'll get shot and they can go on fire it was a wee bit harder I think than the old times where the guys only had arrows and Spears they had least Hansa getting shot but these guys were going against machine guns so after this the horses weren't used as much in battle but they were in this campaign so over the course of a night that's one heavy night of fighting day and night that this is how strong bill was that this guy wrote him all night but I think was 17 hours just all-around or you know 24 hours a whole day another hall another general over the course of one light went through 17 horses because they were just getting too exhausted but this horse just went and went and went but when the sky was and amongst all the battle he saw there were 4 soldiers the next one he saw there were there were 4 soldiers their horses had been shot and they were just out in the open so this go on top of Burrell he went over and picked up these four soldiers so one stood and once stirrup me held on another one stood on one stirrup and held on the other side and another two guys hopped on his back so this horse was carrying five people and they were all holding on for the source and this horse ran a few kilometers and took these guys back to the the medic station and then this guy dropped them off and carried on that's how strong and and how much Willis was had and after while the the guy actually got shot in the leg Michael got the things the name was he got shot in the leg and the horse notice after a while that he wasn't getting any commands from the source from the rider so he actually turned around and went back to the medic station and dropped them off at the medic station and this guy this guy loved go the next one but he lost his leg in the process but the horse saved his life so this is probably one of the most famous Australian war horses but this horse didn't want to do anything like that he had no interested in people riding him were doing anything you know but when this guy showed him a bit of love in and he submitted his will to this guy then then he did these things next one they've made this um this guy's made a big bronze thank you out about I just sort of show you that it's quite interesting okay next one now I just want to read you this this is think about this quote as we go through something else this is just this is why a person that wrote about another popular horse but I just want to get the idea of this and I'll explain to you something later on he says we can be too sentimental but what has been obvious I think and particularly the reaction I've had about warrior because he was doing a display abouts Wars because horses can't speak there's a noble uncomplaining inspirational stoic isn't about the horse going about his work it doesn't have a choice but will go and work for you and in many cases die for you it's kind of sums up the way that we would think that a horse is like they just they're quiet they just go and do their thing all day every day and they seem to just do it uncomplainingly all right now wanted to tell you if your other stories ever want to go to something else this is brother Brandon beyond the curtain of time I think he liked this horses and that's got him in a bit of trouble cuz people said well there's no horses in heaven you know but he said hey my horse was there when I went there that's what I saw he said well isn't this wonderful and then I thought isn't that wonderful I heard something Nick oh like a horse I looked around and my little saddle horse that I used to ride little prince I thought so much of him he was here standing there by me and put his head over my shoulder to hug me like I used to give him sugar you know I think he had a good bond with us or skim a little bit of sugar I put my rounder arm around him I said Prince I knowed you'd be here next one this is an amazing story if you can take into context what we've talked about horses have a nature of if you love them they know it and they actually love you back they can sense the way you're feeling and and they you can break a horse and buy by force and it will actually its will will be broken by force too but that's the way many people used to do it but you can break it in by love and they will be broken in and submit to and say okay there's these two different ways you can do it and this is an amazing story this one rather BMC is I've walked I used to do a lot of riding I've rode for many years and roundup and so forth and I walked into wild horses and some here in a few minutes he'd have his he had laid over my shoulder I just put a blanket on him and walk him around a little with a blanket on him why were the blanket on him then throw the saddle on him then the first thing you know I'd be riding him along see he loves you and if he and if you really love him he knows it this is a completely wild horse now he's saying that he could actually go there and just love the source and it would just come over to him and he would just show love to it and the horse will let him ride it a wild horse that's what he said that's the way that horse is a I'm gonna tell you one more story just real quick this is a there was a an Indian guide and he was he had actually gotten he went to a different area in the states where he didn't usually go and he was having this horse got lost at and it was summer and there wasn't much water and they were trying to find water and then he walked the horse you know they were going going down a path and he thought you know this main path will be with the water as it'll be down this way so so he was he was walking down and then as they were walking down the path this horse started to want to go down this little side path and this man thought no the main way to water is down this main path so he was pulling the horse back and the horse woman want to go and he would bigger Spurs into the horse and make it want to go down this other way and I'm just going to paraphrase it for the sake of the story so he was digging his Spurs into it trying to get it to go down the certain way and it wouldn't go in almost to a point where where he was um the horse was like always falling underneath the guy you know and it was the side was bleeding from the Spurs bring the next one I read this and the horse knew also it was on the child to water had God gives unsink to the dumb beasts and down the trail that went finally a few turned off to one side just the rear a few off the beaten path the horse wanted to turn that way but coy thought different he tried to keep it in the main blaze trail and he started down and the horse would not go he spurred it in a nick and started the other way and it started rearing up she was too weak to back him off so he started pulling the Spurs to it again until he cut the horse next one so excited to get to water his life would be spared until the horse stood quivering bleeding he looked down look down there and she was quivering like that and almost falling under him and he looked down it here and seen the blood on her side he was a Christian and he see it to a source he said I've heard that that wild beasts had an instinct that don't look like that little bitty bunch or that path turned off there would be going to water it looks like this great path here would lead to where they go constantly for water but see it if you've cared me faithful this far I'll follow your instincts oh I think of that about Christ the way to destruction is posted and blazed all the way but there is a narrow road that leads to life few there will be they find it only not instinct but the Holy Spirit will turn you aside to their order of life I think it's brought me safe thus far I'll take up the rest of the way though sorry one before that so now the carry on the story so he went down this path and he found water this is a true story they down that little path they found water and the horse and him were jumping in the water and drinking and then after a little while he heard a yell from some from some guys and just down but from them was some old gold miners you know rugged old gold miners they see and they they saw these guys were hungry that the guy on his horse so they they gave him some food and then after a while they said to the guy here and I have some some whiskey and he said to them oh no thanks I don't I don't drink and then the guy said Knight have some whiskey you know what these guys are like and he said no no I've never drunk I don't drink and he said oh you can eat our beans but you can't drink our whiskey is that what it is you know and so this man started getting angry at him and after a while you pulled out his gun he said you're gonna eat them without drink the whiskey you're gonna die you know you've got two options you know I know you do good as you know there was nothing wrong with me so and his name was Corey I think he when he realized it was all up he said look okay I was gonna I'm not gonna drink the whiskey but just before you shoot me I'm gonna tell you why I don't do it he said my my mother when she was where before I live she told me that my father he died at a gambling table with a pack of cards in his hand in a in a whiskey you know and that was the life he loved and and I made a promise to my mother that I'd never touch the stuff she said that's the way your father went don't touch it so I made a promise to it and I'm not about to break it now kept it all my life through and I'm not going to break it now and then the man says I won't that slats going to be then and then he had the gun in one hand I guess the pistol and the whiskey and the other and just says he was going to do something shot rang out and one of the other guys that are sitting down with them and the camp had shot the bottle out of his hand with his gun and this man said look I made the same promise to my mother years ago but I hadn't kept it you know and I've just gone down this road he said now we're not gonna touch this man and this is a true story that man at that place did all those men to Christ there they all surrendered to the Lord there and you know that started from a horse thinking I'm gonna go this way but that was actually God directing it to go the certain way that's the way God's made a horse now so now we're going to go into a few a few horse stories that are really quite interesting and brother Aaron talks about these abut this is the bureau and his army chasing after the children of Israel so they all come to the Red Sea we know the story and and there's a pillar of fire there by day and night the sifrits or two and then God opens up the Red Sea that's what happened and the children of Israel went across and then when they were near the other side the God moved away over and then the Pharaoh's army with the horses see it okay now is their chance I find this amazing we're going to run through that and catch these guys I find that amazing that you know if you see a ridge if you see a seedpod and people walk across I say look you guys could go on me out of here this no no this is there something more happening here but these guys the heart was so hard and they said get them and now we're gonna run through this open sea this is beyond belief right now I'm gonna read you a quote from brother Branham next one notice walking light-footed and here comes the pretenders behind them these fellas coming along these Egyptians all loaded down and we find out their their wheels broken and they got drowned you know what God did he scared them horses them horses no they were doing wrong they were packing a bunch of sinners across the path why don't we even have horse since they knowed they were wrong please saying I'll read the scriptures and I'll explain to you Exodus 14 says and the Egyptians pursued and went and after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses and his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked through the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and off the cloud and troubled the hosts of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that drove them heavily that they drove him heavily so that the Egyptians he let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fighters for them against the Egyptians so the Lord troubled the hosts but the only ones that recognized that were the horses they were troubled they were spooked they were probably running this way in that way the Egyptians because their hearts were hard and they didn't feel this troubling from God they just pursued on unaware that God was troubling him but the horses were sensitive and they they were frightened and spooked and run this way and probably the chariots were moving around smashing into each other and everything's dad to fall apart because the horses were spooked next one we read the Quran from this quote them horses know they were doing wrong there was packing a bunch of centers across the path why don't we even have horse since they know they were wrong there was an old mule packing a backslidden prophet one time he got scared of the angel he could see the angel Balaam and these horses know they were doing wrong and the Bible said and that makes it right after Bobble see that the Bible said that he frightened Pharaoh's horses they were so long going they didn't know this is the Egyptians they were so long going they didn't know but the horses know knew more than they did may we have a sense like a horse those to recognize when the Spirit of God is troubling us about something thanks ma'am so now this is an interesting story this one who knows the story of Balaam now and the context of horses now now I want to read you the passage of of Balaam right in the context of the understanding of horses but I've changed their word ass or donkey their horse because it's kind of it's the same thing but just for what we're doing here it's like saying a chihuahua and a Great Dane you know there's still a dog they just look slightly different so he was actually unlike had more of a donkey thing but they've got the same the same thing so I've just put horse okay let's read through this and God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for aniversary against them so Balaam has been going against God and he's going to go and prophesy that they against the children of Israel he was going right and and God was angry with him because he didn't want him to go that way to do that this is where we pick the story up now Balaam he was riding upon his horse and two other servants with him and the horse saw the angel of the Lord and the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the horse turned aside out of the way and went into the field so he's walking along on his horse and only the horse sees its angel with a sword draw him because that's God doesn't want Balaam to go that way and the horse turns aside right and Balaam smoke the horse to turn her back into the way go in the right way what are you doing but the angel of the Lord stood in the path of the vineyard a wall being on this side and a wall on the other side and when the horse saw the angel of the Lord she thrust herself against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall and he smote her again stupid horse and the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and when the horse saw the angel of the Lord she fell down under Balaam fell completely down said I'm not going any further and he smoked the horse with a staff now as far as I can read and my research and the Bible as he ever another time where an animal has spoken to a person oh yes different no this so there's one aside from that thank you so from that after that in the whole of the Bible that horses have unique place in the Bible because there are things that only your horse has ever done and from my understanding aside from the serpent there's been no times where an animal has actually spoken to a person this might sound strange but this is what happened right and the Lord opened the mouth of the horse in then the horse said unto balaam what have I done unto thee that thou has smitten me these three times now Balaam has an argument with his horse and Balaam said unto the horse because thou has mocked me I would there were a sword in my hand for now I would kill thee and the horse answers back and a horse said unto balaam am I not thine horse Epona which thou has ridden since I was dying unto this day he's saying you've had me since I was little every took morning you've woken me up of I've you know you've ridden on me every day I've just served you faithfully every day he said was I ever want to do so unto thee he's saying I've I've we've been with you for years carried you around have ye ever done this to you before if I ever done this to you before and then Balaam's about to lose an argument with a horse because Balaam said no now that I think about it no this is strange you've never done this before what's the problem you lost an argument with a horse then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and a sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the Lord said unto Him wherefore has thou smith and nine horses these three times behold I went out to with Stanley because there was perverse before me and the horse saw me and turned it from me these three times unless he had turned from me surely now also I had slain Lee and saved her life and Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord I have sinned for I knew not that they are stood us and the way against me now therefore if it displeased as they all get me back again next one and the angel of the Lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that I shall speak unto thee that shall speak so Balaam went with the princes of Balak interesting game may we be like a horse while there but that's the only time that I've that I know now go to the next one I've got this quote here again because now what this guy talked described about a horse we've actually had this unique insight to get into the mind of a horse because the horse spoke right we've had a persona Reedus quote again we can't be to submit since we know what's been obviously I think here particularly the reaction I've had about warrior because horses can't speak there's a noble uncomplaining inspirational stark ISM about the horse going about its work it doesn't have a choice but will go and work for you any many cases die for you they pretty much summed up their horse correctly because Balaam's horse didn't say look I'm sick of riding for you if you're gonna beat me I'm out of here but just see I've done this all my life have I done this before no it wasn't it actually didn't complain or anything it just I just kept on it wasn't gonna change anything it was just gonna stay there and take whatever it had to take but it was it was just saying have I done anything right I'll go next one I've got another unique thing of a horse can you think of another animal in the Bible that and the natural sense that God has made a supernatural example of it and the natural aside from a prophetic vision like prophets would see visions right but but in terms of actually seeing a natural animal and a supernatural state aside from a horse I can't think of any other and this the taboo thinks of one well we're talking about this I can't think of any any other animals that the Lord has actually and essentially in public outside of a vision was a horse I want to read you this one this is Elijah and Elijah was following Elijah and it came to pass and Elijah was going to go and Elijah he lied she was going to go and he'll I sure knew that and the Bible says and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah sit down to Elijah asked what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from there and he'll I she said I pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said there are there has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I'm taken from the head shelby say unto thee but if not it shall not be so so Elijah is not going to take his hands off Elijah so they're walking and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and a fire imparted in both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elijah Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof so I've been god-like sources he made himself a one out of fire a supernatural one to come down you know he could have just carried him up in some other form but he thought now I'm gonna make a horse and a chariot and I'm gonna have a horse and a chariot come down and pick him up he did it twice actually any light any in in that time then birth to the next one this is Elijah when he was with them his seven I think it was gazer yeah and the the Syrians were were after them and had encamped about the city we picked it up here and he said go and spy where he is we where Elijah is the king of Syria that I may send and fetch him and I was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore scenting he thought the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compares the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host encamped the city both with horses and chariots in other words they came during the night and the morning when he woke up he went looked outside and all around the city were the horses and chariots of the Syrians and next one and a servant said unto him a last my master how shall we do and he and Elijah said fear not for they be more with us well they that be with us are more than that be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray the open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around about Elijah I just think that's amazing that you know the Lord of all the things he could have made he makes the horse and I think there's the only times in the Bible where he makes a supernatural being of a natural animal it's a horse can you think of me we might be onto that one but there's something about a horse this is something about it this is my last point that I want to bring up my last type you know the three horses in the book of Revelation you've got the white horse red horse the black horse now they're actually four but the fourth horses essentially the fourth or says the three all together so that's a the Trinity of these horses there are four but the fourth one of these three and the the you know if we've if we've read the seven seals we know that is that the white horses you know that they had the rider and then I'll just read yukos the next one I read this quote first notice a change of color of these horses same rider change of color of horses and a horse as a beast and a beast and the Bible under a symbol represents a power the same system on another color power from the innocent white to the bloody Red Sea watch him now he's coming now a horse and this sense is representing a power so once again this something has got energy and something else is going to harness the energy and use it right and Satan uses this he uses these different powers to work his will upon the earth to overcome the saints so that so the horses are typed again is this beast that's got power but it won't just use its power it would just sit around but this the Antichrist came on it and the first one was the the white one it was a spiritual power it came and like spiritual you know an innocent and the rider was upon it the second one was a political power when it went and he threw the Roman Empire when it killed all the Christians who slayed people the third one you could say was probably more financial because you know barley for a you know that the scales net it was it was more but the enemy used use these powers and God typed them as horses so you used these different horses next one now he rode on his white horse cunning there he then he was then he was give power he took peace slaughtered the millions that's the red horse that's what he was going to do as soon as he rode on through and he still does it now here he is about honors black horse now coming forth Dark Age that was the time just about the time after the church got set up and gone in power they smothered out everything else the Roman system and went through about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and every and every reader knows as what every reader knows is the dark ages heavenly knows that so we're talking about the dark ages where that the church had full control over the over the basically everything and you could you couldn't really serve the Lord the way he wanted to there was too much control over the whole thing it was a it was a real dark time that was that the power that was represented in this black horse one more I just want to say this because I've got a better type than this right but I just have to go through this one notice the Antichrist now is on a pale horse mixed colors a horses of beasts that represents of power his power has all mixed up why it's politics it's natural powers it's religious powers its theme and powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse and mixed pale horse was he's got all kinds of power and that's what he's doing today he's on this pale horse using all these different types of powers to to to achieve his goal of just to wipe out the Saints and to take control he's on this pale horse with religious power financial power all these different powers you know spiritual power all these different ones is he's the Antichrist as as on his own horse because he needs to any some sort of he's got this desire he needs that power to run that through to now want to change course slightly here he's a quote now want to say something here you might not believe this but I looked it up to be sure there's only one original color everything else is mixed oh there's no one original color and that's white how many knows that there is only one original color anything else is mixed Christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning amen amen every color would be white of some chemistry hadn't broken into it amen glory every church will be standing on the Opera on the Apostolic doctrine of the word of God and confirming it if you didn't have Creed's or denominations and mixed into it then you are oh brother Evans I feel good right now yes sir yes sir next only one original color that's white it never mixed with denominations of Creed's no sir and remember his Saints their clothes and white robes not mixed with denomination in Creed's now we find out the denominational Creed's here is what you got your mixed color but this is the original color he's writing it's talk about a horse now original color is honest people and they've been dipped in blood that cleanse that gum and it sent it right back you're on to see that's right go the next one I want to just I'm gonna work this for a little bit and I want to show you my point now now we we saw the through the three horses right the first one was white but it wasn't really what it was a deceptive it was deceptive this is about the same way Satan deceives people was white red black you know like he deceives with shows it's all okay makes it look good makes it look like it's all okay let young people us find out where everything is gonna be fine you'll have fun you'll like this and a spiritual sin so this doctrines fine don't worry about it's all good you know you'll be happy he he comes in deceitfully and then reared as when he gets you and then black is gone that's the this is the order that he goes and this is how his power works and this grand scheme of the world or just down into our into our lives he does the same way with us if we if we get this Evo him and that white that we're talking about like this source here so I wanna read this one from Corinthians it says but what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that we're in their glory they might be found even as we talk about these people for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works so when we see a white horse in this context we're not talking a pure white pure horse we're talking deception right this that's what we're talking about this Satan can transform himself into an angel of light and deceive people but that's the source here now when I was looking into this I got slightly sidetracked and I just want to run through this for five minutes because I just thought this was so amazing I knew this before but looking into it it was I looked at the callewaert because I sinking in maybe I wanted to look into colors you know because there's something about the color white a true color white so I actually I ended up going to the light spectrum which is you know the colors that are in light I think Isaac Newton when he discovered this I think he had a Jubilee because he was a Christian he would have thought this is amazing you know the these these scientists back in those times most of them were Christians now so who's had it who's done a prism at school you know your son a light through it you do a prism it's cool I think this is amazing you shine a white light white light then to a prism a prism what a prism does is that it essentially reflects all those lights and they're different colors have different wavelengths and so it bounces off one side and off the other side and the different wavelengths of colors cause the colors to separate out so short or color that red has a certain wavelength and the up one and the other side has a longer wavelength so it separates out the colors now I'm not a physicist but that's just it's the way that this thing works so when it comes out the other end now people always thought that I it looks like that because the prism is kind of disrupting the white and it's making some other some other color it's making these colors appear but but Isaac Newton realized no there's a there's a color called white and all these colors actually mix together in it and it's the color is white but then these colors come out of that color so if you mix all those colors together and paint you wouldn't get what would you write but you mix all these light spectrum colors together and you'll get what I just think that's amazing and there's seven colors it's not six it's not 8 it's not 10 this 7 there's seven colors you know people try and argue about God but the more you look into it God's everywhere you know and you know what he what Isaac Newton did after there was he said actually there's no color black and the light solution is no black black doesn't exist he did away with black before that maybe they had black b/c no there's no black with black he didn't even put whitening but white as a combination of all of those colors and that's pure white you know it these colors come out of white you know but there's no black black black doesn't exist go Nixon now if you if you guys want to do a like a science experiment to confirm this you can actually you have to do it a certain way you've got to get a torch three torches and got to put three different cell phones over them colors and you've got a shot and onto a point and the middle point where these three combined will be white amazingly well that's how they make your computer RGB of the three colors but they your white color comes from mixing these colors together you wouldn't think this would happen but when you when it's all together it's white I think God's amazing right go your next one but I just want to tell you about these colors so they so so why is it you didn't see blacks not a color and it's not a color it's only the absence of light that causes everything no matter what it is to go black that's what that's what that's what black is it that's it's it's only there because light is taken away and the more light you take away from something they're more blacker things up here there's a lesson and that might sound simple but there's a major lesson and that the more light you take away the more blacker that thing actually becomes it's like that in our own lives with the light of God and their own lives it's like that in a spiritual sense when the light of the word of God comes even from a fellowship from a people the more the light is taken away the more blacker what is in there becomes just like this that's the principle of this whole thing black is just the absence of light of white and a light since next one and I just I just when I was thinking that the scripture came up which which doesn't say this specifically but when you think about it Solomon the wisest man in the world he was essentially saying this thing in the natural this may not seem like it connects but it does it says in Proverbs it says all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart has a continual feast right and and in terms of you know affliction and that comes from Satan when when you know when we when we even when we drift away you know and we we have less of God we we start to get afflicted but someone that's that's if you're walking in a place of it you can type a flexion to like you know essentially a void of light because we're there's light and is not really a flexion right when you get into that state this isn't a natural sense in our lives we can actually things we can be looking at the same situation but comprehending it definitely because of our flexion that's why people can be next year saying life is them and you can be there saying praise the Lord I'm so happy right that's because you've got light in your life and you're actually looking out at every situation things are seeing color and you see so many beautiful things but if someone can be next to you looking at the same thing and but if they're if they're in darkness all the days of the afflicted are evil because they can't they won't they win there's darkness it just makes everything everything appear dark you not I mean yeah this you know life is such a beautiful thing when we walk with the Lord we see God everywhere we see it just it's so vibrant it's so full of color but you can't have color without light Caesar you take away God you lose life loses all its color that's why today people are getting more and more depressed because they've pushed out light and they're losing all the color they're just becoming so down and afflicted that's just darkness it's things that should be light a dark because it's a lack of color it's a lack of light it just that's what's happening so now this is my point now we want to now the white that we're talking about the light the white is this white we're not talking about this deceptive white like yeah the other horse was even though it's appeared like a white horse not it's not a true white horse right there's what brother BMC is here but we're now Lord appears here on earth he'll be riding on a snow white horse and he'll be completely fully the Emmanuel the Word of God incarnate and a man that's just how much different there is in them that's the difference of them notice the Antichrist is on a pale horse mixed colors a horse as a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics its national powers its religious powers its demon powers it's all kind of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse was he's got all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes it's on one solid color horse the word amen so now we're gonna type this now to this white horse that Christ is on is the word it's just pure it's not its it was the it was a white horse back then it didn't change to a red horse and a black horse it was a white horse back then it's been a white horse all the way through it's been the same all the way through pure not going to change it's a one solid white horse the word now keep that type in mind next one notice well this group is writing making this else ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with him there's another group being made ready after a while so the pale horse and all that demons are coming in being right really after all revelation 19 the next time the churches said she comes also not exactly upon horses but the Bible says he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses that right so now Christ is riding on the white horse of the word the pure word that's the power that's carrying him and then he and then of us when when we appear in Revelation rather I'm saying we are type we're on that same white horse so we were riding upon the same word the white horse of the word that that that's the power that we have to move forward amen one more quote here they're gathering now to do it bringing up subjects from the four corners of the earth riding pale sickly sickly three-colored mix horse amen now in Revelation 19 not only is he going is he getting ready but Christ is getting ready to meet him the battle is going to be hot and here be Christ in Revelation 19 crisis get as gathered his not from the four corners of the earth because he's going to be a little bitty remnant was he doing he's gathering them from the four corners of heaven we'll get him souls under the Alpha tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not four corners of heaven on a snow white horse he also has a name not death but the Word of God life amen God wrote on his thigh here the Word of God that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life there is Zoey that's right and here and he has got life riding on a white horse and here is the man with three different powers mixed up called death gathering his earthbound delegates in crisis gathering his heaven-born subjects Saints he has got death road on whom Christ got life Road on him those with them are on white horses also white horses of the word and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen they're the faithful to the word a mean fuel I like that call chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all simulated with new wine and oil you mean just riding right along coming down to meet them so that's the power that we have right as the power of the word that's the white horse that we wrote on that's who that's that's that's what all the saints all through the ages have written on the white horse of the word now yeah you can say this not I want to say the words lazy but you think about the word of God in this sense what does it do when no one's using it it just sort of it doesn't just go out and it just sits there but we gone right on that white horse of the word you know and it will take us through it will meet any enemy now want you know keep that in mind I want to read this last scripture about these horses about what our horse is like this is one of my most favorite scriptures in the Bible because it's it's powerful okay the next one and this concept oh I sorry keep going Dave oh sorry that one so I read this one here and then we'll go to the next one and we're near fears of white horse he has the word then to mix anything with there any kind of creed add one word to it take one word away from it is to pervert the whole thing oh my keep me with my word Lord that's this other horse the perversion is this other horse mixed and all changing not God don't mix anything with it just keep it the white horse keep it pure all the way through next one now this is the scripture I want to read and keep this in mind as you're thinking you're on your white horse of the word you know you this is this is the thing that you have to bring you forward God's talking to JoVE and he says hast thou given the horse strength as their clothed has NIC with Thunder Kenz they'll make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible next one he poor earth and the valley and rejoices and his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men he mock us at fear and is not a freighted neither turneth he back from the sword the quiver Ratliff's against him the glittering spear and the shield he swallows the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that is a stet it is the sound of a trumpet next one he SAS among the trumpets ha ha and he smell us the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting now let me say this the Word of God if you hop on that word of God that word of God is fearless it'll ride into any enemy anywhere anytime hit on it's not going to turn back at any point it's got this fearless attitude about it you think about it if you've got a situation if you've got some sort of something you need healing for you can get on this word of God Horse and it will just take you straight towards that thing regardless no fear you've got a family issue something something that that you think you know it seems big this word of God it's not worried by a single thing it's got no fear if you put that horse towards it and go towards it it's got no fear whatsoever that's the type of a horse that will just go right towards that I think any situation you've got in your life of thisor if you've got a financial trouble if your guys given you a promise you can go towards that with the Word of God anything in your life that's the horse that we write on that's the you think about that and and that's the promise that we have and that's the horse that we ride on this white horse of the word that is fearless that will take us through any situation anytime anywhere I'm glad that that in this message that we've we we haven't hopped on this other horse this other perverted horse that we know it's deception I'm glad that we've been shown what this white horse is that we can write upon this white horse of the word and they're pure unadulterated word that we can hop on and that's the same horse we're gonna ride all the way through if you get a horse call it word if I get a white horse on a call of word because that's that's really what we are let's um let's stand this morning we'll just pray and then we'll just some my last brother James to sing a few songs Heavenly
