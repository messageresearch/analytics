[27:44] all for us we didn't deserve it we
[27:47] didn't even think we were in the in the
[27:50] picture but then God brought us in the
[27:53] picture amen we're going to um just
[27:56] quickly open up with a word of pray but
[27:58] we want to remember um sister Joyce
[28:01] she's in the hospital with a blood CL
[28:03] clot in her lung you saw that on the
[28:05] brothers and
[28:06] sisters I do believe there's more of us
[28:09] here and if the Lord is with any one of
[28:13] you and inside of you then there's more
[28:16] power in this room to move this Earth
[28:19] Hall amen if if one person can speak a
[28:23] world into
[28:24] existence and brother brandom said you
[28:26] can do that and you can go live on that
[28:28] world if you really want to but see if
[28:30] that faith is here tonight what is
[28:33] impossible for God so let us just bow
[28:35] our heads and let open up in a word of
[28:37] prayer if you have a need tonight bring
[28:40] it before the Lord he sees every need
[28:43] even before you even realized you had
[28:45] the need he knew it was there so he sees
[28:48] everything he knows everything you don't
[28:50] have to worry he is here so let's just
[28:53] bow our heads and raise up your hand
[28:55] lift up your hand to the King of Kings
[28:57] defy gravity
[28:58] say our lord
[29:00] Jesus we have needs Lord we see sister
[29:03] Joyce right now Lord as in hospital
[29:05] father Lord and we cannot be there right
[29:08] now because we Believers Lord we know if
[29:10] we were there we would just lay our
[29:12] hands upon the sick and they shall
[29:14] recover cuz that's your commission
[29:16] that's your promise for us Lord and
[29:18] Faith obtains every promise Lord and we
[29:21] know Lord that by Faith Lord Jesus we
[29:23] can Touch the Hem of your garment Lord
[29:25] in your promises the key of the whole
[29:28] Bible Lord to unlock it is that you're
[29:30] yesterday today and forever the same
[29:32] Lord Lord you cannot change Lord so it's
[29:35] the same recipe for us as Believers
[29:37] father even in the ones that came before
[29:39] us Lord if we believe and we speak to
[29:42] this mountain and it shall be removed
[29:44] Lord father we believe and we come Lord
[29:46] and just want to say we've got a sister
[29:49] in hospital we still have Brother full
[29:50] mending up Lord Jesus each one of us has
[29:53] a need with an uplifted hand father we
[29:56] ask to come our way Lord Lord Jesus just
[29:59] come by our way Lord and Lord we know if
[30:02] you were here you wouldn't even be able
[30:03] to heal us because you've already done
[30:05] it but Lord just encourage our faith
[30:08] strengthen it Lord and give us such a
[30:10] such a a a resolve in your word to know
[30:13] that you can do it father and if we have
[30:16] unbelief we ask that you would bring it
[30:18] to the surface so it can be exposed so
[30:20] you can get rid of it Lord cuz we want
[30:23] nothing between us and you we want
[30:25] nothing to hinder the moving of the Holy
[30:27] Spirit Lord so Lord we come tonight Lord
[30:29] and say help our unbelief Lord we want
[30:32] to say strengthen our faith Lord give us
[30:34] a greater measure of it Lord Lord give
[30:36] us a greater measure of you tonight lord
[30:38] it's Wednesday night it's cold outside
[30:41] father but once more we have gathered to
[30:43] a place Lord we we can give you
[30:45] preeminence because we only came here
[30:47] for you Lord so please would you just
[30:49] take this evening Lord into your hands
[30:52] Lord may you just anoint speaker and
[30:54] hearer Lord May the words be your words
[30:56] words of eternal life Lord l words that
[30:59] bring life Lord Jesus and that would
[31:00] just give a new birth father and give
[31:03] strength and courage to those that need
[31:04] it Lord Lord you said that my yoke oh
[31:08] Lord it is easy and my burden it is so
[31:12] light if you can just take my yoke upon
[31:14] you oh Lord may we just sell out Lord
[31:17] and take your yoke upon us tonight Lord
[31:19] father and just help us by the grace of
[31:21] God to walk in the pages of Time Lord in
[31:24] the pages of your word father and just
[31:26] teach us your way we pray this in the
[31:28] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[31:32] amen
[31:34] amen well brother Jimmy he took my line
[31:37] where's brother Jimmy he took my line he
[31:40] said well you made it it's Wednesday
[31:43] you're here you made it so brother Jimmy
[31:45] that's copyrighted
[31:48] hey okay we're all cont musicians thank
[31:50] you very much so you going hand of
[31:52] Applause for
[31:54] them here's a reason we do that don't
[31:56] don't ever think that this job is an
[31:58] easy job David had no easy job when he
[32:02] was looking after Saul with his heart so
[32:05] sometimes these magicians come in and
[32:07] they have a great battle of their own a
[32:08] whole day they had to fight all their
[32:11] battles and then they have to all
[32:12] surrender that to the side and play some
[32:14] good music so that we can come a little
[32:15] bit closer to God it is an absolute gift
[32:19] and God uses it bless you all for doing
[32:21] that don't think it strange that these
[32:23] musicians they are gifts of God placed
[32:25] in Obits amen so let let's go there to
[32:28] the Book of Matthew Matthew 23 and we're
[32:31] only going to read verse 11 and verse
[32:36] 12 so I promised the Lord I said I'll
[32:39] make as many notes as I can but I
[32:40] promise I won't look at
[32:42] them I think if you've done everything
[32:45] you can then the Lord has to do now the
[32:47] rest so you just pray for me and uh if
[32:50] there's any Pips there in the pie don't
[32:52] stop eating the pie just keep eating the
[32:53] pie eh I don't think there would be but
[32:56] keep eating the apple pie
[33:00] Matthew 23 verse 11 it says but he that
[33:05] is great among you shall be your
[33:07] servant and whosoever shall exalt
[33:11] himself shall be abased and he that
[33:14] shall humble himself shall be exalted
[33:17] may the Lord just add his Blessing to
[33:18] the word you may be
[33:22] seated we're also going to turn the to
[33:24] the book of uh I'm just going to get it
[33:27] man this is a tongue twister I practice
[33:29] it this
[33:30] afternoon Thessalonians is that right
[33:34] the book of Thessalonians in Africans we
[33:36] say tessens is it NE yeah so that's a
[33:40] bit of a tongue twister so trying to do
[33:42] that and thinking Africans say it in
[33:44] English it just sometimes don't happen
[33:46] we're going to go to there to verse
[33:49] four 1 Thessalonians 4 and we're going
[33:52] to go there to verses 14
[33:54] please how are you all feeling tonight
[33:56] amen don't fall asleep on I'll make it
[33:58] short and sweet and hopefully we can
[34:00] just uh give the devil a couple of
[34:03] punches because the thing is we're at
[34:05] War here and there's a battle ranging
[34:07] and you can decide which team you're on
[34:09] so if you're feeling you're falling
[34:10] asleep I'm telling you the enem is
[34:12] winning so just pull harder I always
[34:15] tell you the story and I'm going to say
[34:16] it many a times there's a big lake of
[34:18] fire and the devil wants to pull you
[34:20] inside there and it's a big tug of wall
[34:23] and you're on the one side and he's on
[34:25] the other side he's pulling as hard as
[34:27] he can to tonight but guess what if you
[34:29] start pulling as well and you take some
[34:31] of the word you'll put him in there
[34:33] that's his place that's where he's going
[34:35] to end up so if you pull you'll receive
[34:38] don't don't want to end up in the Lake
[34:39] of Fire for whatever reason so we're
[34:41] going to start then and it says thereby
[34:43] verse
[34:45] 14 my title for tonight is the missing
[34:48] puzzle
[34:49] piece for if we believe that Jesus died
[34:52] and rose again even so them that also
[34:56] which sleep in Jesus
[34:58] will God bring with him so remember
[35:01] Saints don't die we just sleep yeah okay
[35:05] don't sleep on the
[35:06] job go rest but while we're here we
[35:09] fight okay when we get up there we rest
[35:12] okay amen amen can I add amen for that
[35:16] amen so while this day let's let's make
[35:18] some hey hey for this we say unto you
[35:21] that the word of the
[35:23] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[35:26] unto the coming of the the Lord shall
[35:28] not prevent them which are asleep for
[35:31] the Lord himself shall descend from
[35:33] heaven with a shout and with a voice and
[35:35] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[35:38] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[35:41] first amen and then they which are alive
[35:46] will remain shall be caught up together
[35:49] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[35:51] in the air and so shall we be forever
[35:55] with the Lord can I get an aen amen
[35:58] there amen so that's your scripture
[36:01] that's my scripture that's when the the
[36:03] message of the hour was released upon
[36:05] this Earth I never understood that
[36:08] scripture because it never actually
[36:10] spoke about me it was just some saints
[36:13] that's going to become alive again yeah
[36:16] but when the prophet came and he
[36:18] preached all the sermons that he's
[36:19] preached for us everything that he's
[36:21] given us he opened the book that
[36:23] scripture became more and more my
[36:25] scripture because before that I didn't
[36:27] know if it was going to be a Jew or if
[36:29] it was going to be a gentile or is it
[36:31] going to be is this just a is it a is it
[36:33] a physical going up in the clouds and
[36:36] you're trying to work it out by mind but
[36:38] and all the scholars everybody has their
[36:40] own opinion on it so we really did need
[36:42] a prophet just say this is going to
[36:44] happen just like the Bible says the
[36:46] wonderful thing about the word Prophet
[36:48] is it brings us back into the word oh
[36:50] yes okay because he will not take us
[36:53] away from the word he will not add to
[36:55] the word he will just say it as it is
[36:57] but makes the word du tail he makes the
[36:59] word come together and that's what the
[37:01] gift was that God sent him is to bring
[37:03] the word together now we all here
[37:06] together this is your scripture brother
[37:08] Ben said it so nicely everyone will
[37:10] fulfill their scripture for their day
[37:13] this is your
[37:14] scripture I I want you to realize
[37:16] there's people that going to walk off
[37:18] the face of the Earth this is your
[37:20] scripture see don't worry about the news
[37:23] don't worry about agendas don't worry
[37:26] about your next meeting just remember
[37:29] this is your scripture you don't have to
[37:31] figure it out you don't have to work it
[37:33] out Enoch didn't work that way he just
[37:35] knew that this if it was said in
[37:37] Africans or it was said in English or it
[37:39] was said in Su perana whatever this was
[37:43] his scripture and he lived for that
[37:47] scripture but it's not just your
[37:50] scripture I want you to think of it this
[37:53] is not just everybody in this place of
[37:55] scripture because there's many out there
[37:58] still that needs to fulfill the
[37:59] scripture cuz if all of us fulfilled the
[38:01] scripture guess what we wouldn't be
[38:04] here when the bride is ready and in a
[38:07] position we would be up there so there's
[38:10] still a little bit of work to do isn't
[38:12] there amen or else if if if the word was
[38:15] fulfilled and the Lord brought the last
[38:16] one in then we should be walking the
[38:19] Trump should sound the grave should open
[38:22] we should be having a jubilee with all
[38:23] the saints of old we know things were
[38:25] happening but because it's not happening
[38:27] it means there's still something going
[38:29] on and there's still a responsibility
[38:31] there is still a missing puzzle piece
[38:35] amen amen so Job 38 God goes and speaks
[38:38] to job and job you know he went through
[38:42] a lot of Trials and and God bless him
[38:44] you know like he really he went through
[38:46] the ringer and just before he really
[38:49] felt sorry for himself and he started
[38:51] rehearsing the word of God and just
[38:53] thinking about these things because
[38:54] that's what we do when things go really
[38:55] hard we start thinking about scriptures
[38:58] we start thinking about Lord what what
[39:00] can I get from this I I don't want to be
[39:02] in this trial too long but while I'm
[39:04] here what are you trying to tell me
[39:07] there's something that's happening you
[39:08] need to talk to me Lord and then he says
[39:10] to to job and you can go Job 38 verse
[39:13] three just go with me there cuz I read
[39:16] really badly and you check up if I'm
[39:18] doing it right okay you can be the
[39:20] teacher tonight Talia you can put that
[39:22] up he says G up now thy loins like a man
[39:27] [Laughter]
[39:29] so God comes to jeah and goes shape up
[39:31] bro come on wake up G yourself up you
[39:36] know you like we feel sorry for
[39:38] ourselves but there's a time where the
[39:39] Lord just wants to go can you just shake
[39:41] yourself off can you just get beside
[39:43] yourself there's a greater purpose here
[39:46] and we so on a pretty party and we feel
[39:48] so bad but all God wants to tell you is
[39:50] I want you to step out of this trial for
[39:52] a second I want you to come up a little
[39:54] bit higher yeah I need to talk to you
[39:57] but when you come up higher don't feel
[39:59] sorry for yourself because then you're
[40:00] still in the previous state you've been
[40:02] in when you come up higher let's just
[40:04] get it all tucked in and stand U right
[40:06] Andress me like a man because when I'm
[40:09] going to talk to you is going to be for
[40:11] the edifying of your and my body because
[40:14] remember we're all the body of Christ
[40:16] and sometimes he gets you attention
[40:18] because he wants a one-on-one
[40:19] conversation with you to say Shape Up
[40:21] amen okay and he speaks here to to um
[40:24] job not that job did anything wrong but
[40:27] just remember he was in a really bad
[40:29] State and and he he was went through
[40:31] trials but God says stop feeling sorry
[40:33] for yourself I want to remind you of
[40:35] something and we carry on he says and
[40:39] answer thou me so now he's asking you
[40:41] should talk to me he says where was thou
[40:44] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[40:47] declare so he's respecting a response
[40:50] now here this is this is hard questions
[40:53] you know now think about you in the
[40:54] trial don't just think about Paul o Joe
[40:56] put you in his choose we fulfill
[40:58] scripture and some days you're going to
[41:00] walk in this part of the scripture and
[41:02] this is going to be your portion and it
[41:04] is hard to walk there when because job
[41:06] walked there because it's a testimony
[41:08] for you so it can help you in that time
[41:11] but you're walking in that scripture
[41:12] God's asking you now hey declare unto me
[41:16] okay where were you when I formed the
[41:19] foundation of the
[41:20] earth so when God says you're going to
[41:23] come back to me in the Rapture God's
[41:25] also telling you you were there before
[41:27] before the Rapture even began so he's
[41:30] telling job and he's taking him now
[41:31] outside of time outside of what we know
[41:34] is time and he's taking him into the
[41:36] internal realm and he says before all
[41:38] this time
[41:40] began Before Time even began where were
[41:43] you so if you believe you're going to
[41:45] fulfill first
[41:48] Thessalonians then you should also
[41:49] believe you already fulfilled this part
[41:52] where were thou when I formed the
[41:53] foundations of the
[41:55] Earth because he asking job a very
[41:58] serious questions the sons of God the
[41:59] stars of gods were shouting for joy and
[42:01] rejoicing where were you so he's taking
[42:03] him out of time can you step out of your
[42:06] time and walk with God or are we so time
[42:10] bound that God cannot do anything in our
[42:12] life Lord help us Lord because when we
[42:16] time bound we can't wait for an
[42:19] answer when we time bound when we on our
[42:21] knees it takes too long to
[42:24] pray when we time bound and our sons and
[42:27] daughters are doing something silly we
[42:29] can't wait for them to stop it because
[42:30] we want to go on with our normal life
[42:33] but see we're not time bound I want you
[42:36] to realize this we are in time but we
[42:38] are not time bound we are Eternal beings
[42:42] amen you have a
[42:44] theophany keeps clocking on that's your
[42:47] home with God he says Heaven is my
[42:50] heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot
[42:52] stol but where's the place of my rest
[42:54] that's in The Believer Hallelujah so so
[42:56] we're inti just because God wants to
[42:58] express his Plan of Redemption in US you
[43:00] all follow me so you got put in time
[43:03] because God has a plan for
[43:05] you you didn't get put in time because
[43:08] you just happened to be in time so
[43:10] remember the author that says you're
[43:12] coming in a Rapture is the author that
[43:13] says where were you when the foundations
[43:15] were formed Hallelujah in God part of
[43:18] God lord so his promise for
[43:21] us is that I will not leave you so in
[43:24] the book of Isaiah 493
[43:27] he says Sing oh heavens and be ye joyful
[43:29] o Earth and Break Forth into singing oh
[43:33] Mountains for the Lord have comforted
[43:36] his people and he will have mercy upon
[43:39] his
[43:41] afflicted that's his
[43:43] promise he says but the very next verse
[43:46] says but Zion yeah but Zion said the
[43:49] Lord ha forsaken me the Lord have
[43:52] forgotten me so we represent Zion
[43:57] we are the bride of Christ and sometimes
[44:00] you're in a trial and it feels like God
[44:02] has forgotten about you God has forsaken
[44:04] you but see God didn't say that just go
[44:06] one back there
[44:07] Italia he said sing oh heavens Break
[44:09] Forth and be joyful oh Earth break into
[44:12] singing oh Mountains and the Lord has
[44:15] comforted his people and he has mercy
[44:17] upon his afflicted yeah full
[44:21] stop so no matter where you find
[44:23] yourself that is God's promise to you he
[44:25] says don't worry about just keep singing
[44:28] amen just keep rejoicing it's not about
[44:31] the trial I know what's going on you can
[44:33] go on the next verse Lord so Zion
[44:36] complains next
[44:38] one he says can a woman forget her
[44:40] suckling child that she would not have
[44:43] compassion on a son of her womb yay they
[44:47] may
[44:48] forget a mother might forget her son but
[44:52] I will not forget thee Hallelujah
[44:58] you I'm so mindful of your situation I
[45:01] just want to say I cannot forget you
[45:03] next one sister Talia he says behold I
[45:06] have Graven thee on the palms of my
[45:11] hand that's why I died so that you can
[45:15] remember that I'm thinking of you amen
[45:18] it's not just to cover sin that's great

[56:18] board and I forgot Mo's
[56:21] name totally forgot Mo's name not on
[56:24] purpose I actually forgot Mo's name
[56:26] and I was writing all the names on the
[56:28] board and it was Sunday school and you
[56:29] know and ab stopped and he goes where's
[56:34] Mo I said man that's so good because you
[56:38] are your brother's keeper
[56:40] amen and mo wouldn't have been there and
[56:43] got onto that name if nobody called that
[56:48] name okay follow me we're still going
[56:51] that was the that was the nice part so
[56:54] in the church we have gifts of and
[56:58] callings and the gifts and callings is a
[57:01] couple of things but we've got deacons
[57:03] which is now let's say we've got
[57:05] positions in the church and it's deacons
[57:08] and and we've got uh trustees Sunday
[57:10] school superintendent Sunday school
[57:12] teachers then we've got the treasurer
[57:15] then we got the edifying of the body the
[57:17] cooks they make us food the cleaners the
[57:22] musos these these different people
[57:24] that's just bringing all their they
[57:26] gifting and doing it naturally and doing
[57:28] it really good and God anoints those
[57:30] gifts for the edifying of the Body for
[57:33] the helping of the
[57:35] body but that's just us being the body
[57:37] of Christ together then we've got the
[57:40] fivefold ministry who knows who's the
[57:42] fivefold
[57:43] ministry
[57:45] pastors
[57:46] teachers
[57:48] evangelists prophets Apostles okay those
[57:52] are ordained men of God they're not
[57:55] gifts
[57:57] there are men that God plac in that
[57:59] position it's a
[58:01] Ministry and those ones are also like
[58:03] brother brandham said and I'll read you
[58:05] the quote now for the edifying of the
[58:06] body and he gives them to us to help us
[58:10] to guide our way through this PL because
[58:12] the whole body is Jesus Christ and Jesus
[58:17] Christ cannot go in a Rapture and take
[58:19] his body and fulfill your scripture if
[58:21] the last part of his body is not
[58:24] there now follow me I've got to a point
[58:27] I'm getting
[58:29] there then in there there's spiritual
[58:32] gifts spiritual gifts where the Lord
[58:35] sends the spirit and the spirit of the
[58:37] Lord manifests through different gifts
[58:39] like wisdom there's nine spiritual gifts
[58:43] who can name them who knows you about
[58:44] wisdom discern
[58:48] discernment
[58:50] prophecy I'll help you go to 1
[58:53] Corinthians 12 this is a little bit of
[58:56] Sunday school but go there cuz you need
[58:59] to understand where these things happen
[59:00] and and where they lie and if you
[59:03] understand where these gifts lie then we
[59:05] understand that those gifts are for
[59:07] you and God uses the gifts but you have
[59:10] to surrender that gift hey
[59:14] AB you have to surrender that
[59:17] gift because God cannot use you if
[59:20] you're not a perfect mute if you're not
[59:22] a mic so you might have a real good of
[59:24] music
[59:26] but that doesn't mean you're using it
[59:28] for
[59:31] God you might be playing in the
[59:34] church but that doesn't mean you're
[59:37] using it for God it's just still a gift
[59:39] of
[59:40] music so songs though you know those
[59:42] those um musicians that when they sing
[59:45] they try to be Pitch Perfect all the
[59:48] time with this massive vocal range and
[59:49] they do have it that's a gift I try that
[59:54] I will fall apart it's a gift and it's
[59:57] for the body of Christ but if you use
[1:00:01] your gift for lifting yourself up God
[1:00:04] cannot use you because it's for the body
[1:00:06] of
[1:00:07] Christ so we're all the body of Christ
[1:00:10] so your whole mentality should be Lord
[1:00:13] how are you going to use my gift to
[1:00:15] reach your people absolutely so it is a
[1:00:18] little bit of just bear with me we're
[1:00:20] coming to a point where it's very
[1:00:21] important that you surrender this gift
[1:00:25] fully to the Lord and while you do it
[1:00:28] yourself as well or else it's just a
[1:00:31] gift and gifts are calling us without
[1:00:34] repentance that means nothing but when
[1:00:37] you can surrender your gift and God can
[1:00:39] come and anoint that gift he can reach
[1:00:41] his seed he can reach the last puzzle
[1:00:43] piece which we're all looking for
[1:00:45] because we still sit here am so that
[1:00:49] means whoever needs to be there is still
[1:00:51] not there because we all still here
[1:00:56] so we're not here to have church we're
[1:00:58] here for the missing puzzle pieace amen
[1:01:02] so now we're there with the spiritual
[1:01:04] gifts look what it says in verse 7 1
[1:01:07] Corinthians 12:7 it says but the
[1:01:09] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:01:12] every man to profit with all the
[1:01:15] manifestation of the spirit so that
[1:01:17] means you're not a
[1:01:19] prophet you've got the gift of
[1:01:22] Prophecy but you might have multiple
[1:01:24] gifts and brother Brandon was going to
[1:01:25] say said I'll say it now he says you
[1:01:27] have multiple gifts some might have two
[1:01:29] some might have one some God might only
[1:01:31] use once and never again it is for God
[1:01:35] to manifest through that gift to reach
[1:01:38] his members Amen to get the hand to be
[1:01:40] where the hand is and the fingers to be
[1:01:42] the fingers because we're cutting with
[1:01:44] KN he says for one is given the spirit
[1:01:45] of the word of wisdom another the word
[1:01:48] of knowledge to the other faith and the
[1:01:51] spirit that gives the other one healing
[1:01:53] healing is a spiritual gift
[1:01:56] and it's not always just a physical
[1:01:58] healing it's a healing brother Ben has
[1:02:00] got that
[1:02:01] gift and God uses it through his life
[1:02:04] God bless you brother Ben because he's
[1:02:06] got a heart for the people and God can
[1:02:08] see the sincerity and he can use that
[1:02:11] and healing comes because when we were
[1:02:13] broken when we had to give all our
[1:02:15] rubbish which we had inside of us get it
[1:02:17] out we needed to go somewhere to get
[1:02:20] counseling to help us for healing and he
[1:02:22] put a pastor with that gift there he's
[1:02:24] not just a pastor there's a healing gift
[1:02:26] in him and my body didn't need healing
[1:02:30] but my body needed healing I needed
[1:02:33] healing amen so God will use that gift
[1:02:36] if you can surrender that gift to the
[1:02:38] Lord amen so you come to church every
[1:02:41] Sunday and you think why am I here why
[1:02:44] does nothing happen
[1:02:46] ever it's your
[1:02:50] fault it's your fault you're not
[1:02:52] surrendering your gift you're majoring
[1:02:55] on a minor God wants to use your
[1:02:58] discernment but when it comes to using
[1:03:00] it you shy away because oh maybe
[1:03:03] somebody says something you are limiting
[1:03:06] God from using you as a vessel to reach
[1:03:09] his P bride they must be the last puzzle
[1:03:13] piece could be sitting here right here
[1:03:14] tonight and God wants to speak in
[1:03:16] tongues and corrects them and he wants
[1:03:18] to interpreter but you're to scare to
[1:03:20] step out of your
[1:03:21] bubble because what if the guy next to
[1:03:23] me says
[1:03:24] something you have a gift God has placed
[1:03:27] it here for the edifying of his body
[1:03:29] amen not to keep for yourself so we as
[1:03:33] as as brothers and sisters must realize
[1:03:36] the person next to you is just if not
[1:03:38] more important than you because remember
[1:03:40] what we said in Matthew you be his
[1:03:43] servant and if you realize that a
[1:03:45] brother can say something under
[1:03:47] inspiration to you at the right time and
[1:03:49] God could break that thing amen but if
[1:03:52] you think about that guy anything
[1:03:54] outside of a tool in God's hand
[1:03:56] hands a weapon in God's
[1:03:59] hands you have belittled him and his
[1:04:01] gift is worth
[1:04:02] nothing so remember there's a reason
[1:04:04] there's gifts there's we've got the
[1:04:06] ministry and everybody always looks at
[1:04:07] the prophets and the teachers and the
[1:04:09] and all the big things what about the
[1:04:11] gifts in our church what's going on here
[1:04:16] shakina what's going on here are we
[1:04:19] really using our gifts for for God and
[1:04:22] it's not I'm not fighting with you it
[1:04:24] dawned on me when I did this I thought
[1:04:26] Lord am I actually digging in deep and
[1:04:28] saying Lord whatever you want to do you
[1:04:31] do it through me I Surrender it
[1:04:33] all are we that serious about God's
[1:04:36] kingdom are we that serious about going
[1:04:38] home cuz I want to fulfill that first
[1:04:40] Rapture I want to ful first scripture I
[1:04:42] want to go in the Rapture he says then
[1:04:44] as well then then there's tongues and
[1:04:47] interpretation
[1:04:49] healing he says prophecy Discerning
[1:04:52] tongues interpretation but all these
[1:04:54] work that one and the same self Spirit
[1:04:57] which is God dividing to every man um
[1:05:02] severely as he will for as the body is
[1:05:06] one he has made members and all the
[1:05:09] members of one body being many are one
[1:05:14] body also as Christ is or also is Christ
[1:05:19] so guess what the guy sitting next to
[1:05:21] you that you think he ain't going to
[1:05:22] make it God can use him more than you
[1:05:27] but guess what if he's the puny and
[1:05:30] we've got the rest of the body here you
[1:05:33] can't leave without the CU God ain't
[1:05:36] going to leave any of his body behind so
[1:05:39] when you can see him as God's body as
[1:05:42] someone that that is a part of God
[1:05:44] without the circumstance right
[1:05:47] now then you can win him for Christ amen
[1:05:52] I'm about to close don't worry I don't
[1:05:54] want I don't want to go too long
[1:05:56] Luke 18 there was a certain blind man
[1:05:58] and I want to speak about this quickly
[1:06:01] go into you you don't have to go into
[1:06:02] your bibles if you want but Luke
[1:06:04] 18 so Jesus comes to comes to
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:14] um he's on his way there to
[1:06:19] Jericho and uh you know there where
[1:06:22] Jesus goes we there at verse um so Luke
[1:06:25] 18 and we pretty much there at verse 35
[1:06:27] if you want to follow in what I'm say so
[1:06:29] he comes to Jericho and there's this
[1:06:31] blind man that's there at the at the
[1:06:34] gate and he's asking for for arms okay
[1:06:37] so it says and it came to pass that he
[1:06:39] was Come N to Jericho a certain blind
[1:06:41] man sat there by the way begging and
[1:06:44] hearing the multitude passed by he asked
[1:06:47] what it
[1:06:48] meant now you're sitting at school now
[1:06:51] you think why would I go here you're
[1:06:53] sitting at school there's a blind guy
[1:06:56] coming your way but you just had an
[1:06:58] awesome Sunday and you're buzzing and
[1:07:00] you're happy and he goes to you why are
[1:07:02] you
[1:07:02] happy why are you different what is the
[1:07:06] difference between this blind man that
[1:07:08] cannot see the light of his day to the
[1:07:10] guy at your school at your workers
[1:07:12] asking why are you
[1:07:13] happy cuz we're talking now about the
[1:07:15] gifts we're talking about God placing
[1:07:18] you in a body but the body is here but
[1:07:20] the body should be moving together in
[1:07:22] unison so that we can get forward
[1:07:24] momentum so that we can re that last one
[1:07:26] because without him the puzzle piece is
[1:07:28] not complete we as a body is worth
[1:07:32] nothing no matter how good you sing No
[1:07:35] matter how good you preach you're
[1:07:36] actually currently with nothing until we
[1:07:39] get the last one and then we can fulfill
[1:07:40] our scripture the picture is complete
[1:07:42] then we can go home isn't that the whole
[1:07:45] purpose so this man is asking what
[1:07:48] what's going on hearing the multitudes
[1:07:51] and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth
[1:07:53] is passing by
[1:07:56] I went to
[1:07:58] camp and the Lord got me at camp and he
[1:08:01] saved my soul amen and he brought my
[1:08:04] wife in am you know what I believe a
[1:08:07] message that has life I saw sick healed
[1:08:10] am I saw cripples get healed I saw blind
[1:08:13] people I heard the gospel being preached
[1:08:16] the word being open man come and see
[1:08:18] amen come and see cuz there's there's
[1:08:21] desperate people out there that wants
[1:08:23] this word that God is sending you to
[1:08:25] preach this word and you don't have to
[1:08:27] preach to them share your testimony tell
[1:08:29] them how you candle god letter but do
[1:08:31] something it's not about Works you're
[1:08:34] not going to work your way we're not
[1:08:35] seven day Adventists here you're not
[1:08:37] working your yourself into heaven amen
[1:08:40] but man you found Grace in the sight and
[1:08:42] your friends are asking you why are you
[1:08:44] different amen and if you're not
[1:08:46] different then I was saying your friends
[1:08:47] are asking you why you not
[1:08:50] different why you just like the other
[1:08:52] guys you know these guys that ask my son
[1:08:55] the one day they said to him why are you
[1:08:57] not like that one that goes to the CH
[1:08:58] he's a Christian too
[1:09:01] yeah you should just say to them come
[1:09:04] and
[1:09:05] see Jesus has passed me by amen amen and
[1:09:09] we go on he says and he cried saying
[1:09:14] Jesus thou son of David have mercy upon
[1:09:18] me because remember this guy was blind
[1:09:21] he can't help himself to follow Jesus
[1:09:23] wherever he's going but he his testimony
[1:09:26] of those multitudes says Jesus is coming
[1:09:28] by and he would have heard many of
[1:09:30] stories about Jesus before many of
[1:09:33] children testifying that hey in our
[1:09:35] church we don't just fall asleep man God
[1:09:37] moves in my church when when when God
[1:09:40] comes in we sing and we worship and we
[1:09:42] allowed to lift our hands and we allowed
[1:09:43] to dance to the left and we right and
[1:09:46] dance to the left your left we are
[1:09:48] allowed to do that we can do whatever we
[1:09:51] want in the in the order of church under
[1:09:53] the holy spirit's anointing we're not
[1:09:56] dead we're not formal we're not some
[1:09:57] dead bones that brother Isaac wrote
[1:09:59] about he's the ones that come alive come
[1:10:02] and see man
[1:10:04] amen but but but what happens is when we
[1:10:06] get out in the in the world we kind of
[1:10:09] forgot our identity we forgot our
[1:10:11] purpose we forget why we're here we
[1:10:14] forget that we're not just a church
[1:10:16] member we're a
[1:10:17] body and if we're all here tonight
[1:10:20] where's the
[1:10:22] rest so testify talk to them share the
[1:10:25] goodness of God if brother Colin and 100
[1:10:29] times you tell someone that and they
[1:10:30] still don't believe you just keep
[1:10:31] telling it you're doing a good job CU
[1:10:34] God's using you as a
[1:10:36] witness and there will be a hung blind
[1:10:39] man looking for Christ that would call
[1:10:42] out where's that Christ and he'll come
[1:10:43] and
[1:10:44] see and it says and when they went
[1:10:46] before him the people rebuked him they
[1:10:48] say a come on man the message of the
[1:10:50] hour is just a bunch of nonsense days of
[1:10:53] Miracles are passed it's just a they're
[1:10:56] all looking to a
[1:10:57] man Moses was a Man Too Elijah was a man
[1:11:01] too Daniel was a Man Too Paul was a Man
[1:11:04] Too yes I'm looking to a man but it was
[1:11:06] more than a man it was an anointed man
[1:11:09] for his
[1:11:10] time no man spoke like this man and I
[1:11:14] believe you when Paul started preaching
[1:11:15] and you were under Paul's Ministry you
[1:11:17] would have gone no man speaks like that
[1:11:20] man amen he doesn't even sound like the
[1:11:22] Pharisees but he used to be one yeah
[1:11:25] used to be all Pious and great no man
[1:11:27] spoke like this man and I can only tell
[1:11:30] you by the re Revelation that God gave
[1:11:32] me that this message has overcoming
[1:11:34] power why cuz it works amen I'm
[1:11:37] overcoming every day the things I used
[1:11:39] to do that was that that that col sister
[1:11:42] that said I ain't I ain't what I want to
[1:11:44] be and I ain't what I ought to be but
[1:11:46] thank God I ain't what I used to be but
[1:11:49] every time I walk with God and every
[1:11:51] tape I listen and every sermon I'm here
[1:11:52] I just keep eating and pulling and I
[1:11:54] just keep growing and growing and Faith
[1:11:56] just takes a hold and God just gets
[1:11:58] bigger in my life because why this
[1:12:00] message works because it's not
[1:12:02] introducing me to a man it introducing
[1:12:05] me to the man of Jesus Christ the person
[1:12:07] of the holy spirit because remember
[1:12:10] we're one
[1:12:11] body so whose body is this I'm asking
[1:12:14] you whose body William
[1:12:16] brandom body of who Jesus Christ so what
[1:12:20] did William bradam do he surrendered his
[1:12:22] life and all his gifts the gift of
[1:12:25] prophecy the gift of bringing it all and
[1:12:26] being a major prophet surrendering
[1:12:28] himself to God and saying Lord use me to
[1:12:31] reach your
[1:12:32] bride and he did that and then from
[1:12:35] there on God moved him off the scene and
[1:12:37] now he's dealing with us and he says if
[1:12:39] you have any doubt about any Scripture
[1:12:41] which all the other guyses and
[1:12:42] theologians don't even know about and
[1:12:44] think they know about just listen to the
[1:12:46] message I got some good food in due
[1:12:49] season for you that would help you
[1:12:50] overcome but I find that we we don't
[1:12:53] overcome because we don't spend time in
[1:12:54] the world
[1:12:55] we don't spend time in the message and
[1:12:57] don't take it back to the word and then
[1:12:59] we forget our purpose and all of a
[1:13:01] sudden we go why are we not fulfilling
[1:13:03] first Thessalonians 4 why am I not
[1:13:06] walking like Enoch because we're seeing
[1:13:08] it but why am I not doing it well
[1:13:10] because we're not doing our
[1:13:12] job we're not doing our job we got so
[1:13:15] used to be under a under this this a
[1:13:18] brother Ben said it's so nice he likes
[1:13:21] preaching where the rubber hits the
[1:13:22] road we we have so many quotes and so
[1:13:26] many things that we say but we have no
[1:13:29] life I'm being honest because if you had
[1:13:32] the life and a blind man walk past you
[1:13:34] or a kid at school would say hey what's
[1:13:36] going on you would say come and see but
[1:13:37] you would compel him to come and see
[1:13:39] because you know that Jesus has the
[1:13:41] answer he's done it for Blind Men before
[1:13:44] he can do it for you amen and this blind
[1:13:46] man after the people rebuked him and
[1:13:48] told him how bad the message was he
[1:13:50] screw out oven more he said Jesus oh son
[1:13:52] of David have mercy upon me amen cuz he
[1:13:55] wanted to be have mercy on how many
[1:13:58] times should your friends ask you about
[1:14:00] God how many times how many they
[1:14:03] desperate to know him and all you do is
[1:14:05] you keep quiet because you're scared
[1:14:08] what would happen to you but then Jesus
[1:14:11] walks and he hears this man and he
[1:14:12] stands still he says and he stood and he
[1:14:17] said bring that man to
[1:14:19] me see now something
[1:14:22] happened you said come and see your
[1:14:25] friend walks in here and he comes and
[1:14:27] sits down or your person at
[1:14:30] work and God is in his channel that day
[1:14:34] and he's preaching and he's knocking on
[1:14:35] his door see Zaki has come out the tree
[1:14:38] cuz that just happened after that
[1:14:40] tonight I'm going to dine at your house
[1:14:42] and stuff got real for zakus because
[1:14:43] zakus just wanted to see God he really
[1:14:45] wanted to see God it was pressed upon
[1:14:47] his heart but this bind man SC and Jesus
[1:14:50] goes to the blind man and he says to him
[1:14:52] what would you want what would you want
[1:14:55] want me to do for
[1:14:57] you and he says I just want back my
[1:15:00] sight he says what Willl thou that I
[1:15:02] shall do unto
[1:15:04] thee and he said Lord that I might
[1:15:06] receive my
[1:15:07] sight that this veil of tradition this
[1:15:11] this doctrines of man the word of a
[1:15:14] Preacher the the depression the things
[1:15:17] that's keeping me away from your word
[1:15:18] from your joy the things that people
[1:15:20] might tell us that oh days of Miracles
[1:15:22] are over see the the the one thing about
[1:15:25] denomination is it it made sure it tried
[1:15:27] to bury
[1:15:29] Christ with my opinion a second opinion
[1:15:32] a third opinion they got a whole book of
[1:15:34] opinions but they don't have the Living
[1:15:35] Word and when you start quoting The
[1:15:37] Living Word they tell you those words
[1:15:39] weren't
[1:15:42] inspired they do oh oh that's not that's
[1:15:45] not because in the Old Testament they
[1:15:47] did it this way and they hide it behind
[1:15:49] words but they don't want to take
[1:15:50] everything and here I'm saying in front
[1:15:52] of you Jesus of Nazareth have passed
[1:15:54] through
[1:15:55] that voice that came that he spoke of
[1:15:58] that was brother
[1:16:00] Brenham that shout was the angel that
[1:16:02] came down there was the ministry this is
[1:16:04] this message going forth we spoke to it
[1:16:06] on the ministers meeting that's the
[1:16:08] message that went forth that's a shout
[1:16:10] getting the bride ready so remember with
[1:16:13] the five foolish and the five wise
[1:16:15] versions there was a shout when that
[1:16:17] case is the bridegroom cometh get
[1:16:19] ready they was a
[1:16:22] shout that's brother brenham's Ministry
[1:16:24] then the voice of God is the one in
[1:16:26] Revelation 10:7 that is making the
[1:16:28] mysteries of god good and it's coming
[1:16:30] now and can we turn off the heat here as
[1:16:33] well a bit because it's pretty hot
[1:16:35] brother
[1:16:36] ID and that voice came back don't worry
[1:16:40] everything's fine The Voice came and
[1:16:42] that voice is speaking to you every day
[1:16:45] that voice is leading you and guiding
[1:16:47] you and before that voice will get you
[1:16:49] into a place where you can get that
[1:16:50] Trump and you can and the dead will rise
[1:16:52] and we will go back to Glory
[1:16:55] so just remember that but what you need
[1:16:58] to remember is the blind man is asking
[1:17:02] where is the Lord your blind friends and
[1:17:05] your blind family and blind everyone is
[1:17:07] asking where's Jesus I want to see and
[1:17:11] all I'm asking you is are you taking
[1:17:12] those conversations serious enough to
[1:17:15] know that that might be the last missing
[1:17:17] puzzle piece that will add to us so we
[1:17:20] can go
[1:17:21] home does it make sense I know it was a
[1:17:23] little bit all over I was trying to just
[1:17:26] get the two thoughts together blind man
[1:17:29] got there because someone turned around
[1:17:31] and says Jesus is passing by he didn't
[1:17:33] start testifying how good Jesus were he
[1:17:36] just said Jesus is passing by and that
[1:17:38] was all that that blind man had to see
[1:17:40] because he had enough scripture and
[1:17:42] enough gumption in him to know that if I
[1:17:44] can reach that man I can shout out to
[1:17:46] that man he'll hear me he will heal
[1:17:48] me so it's not a rebuke and it's not a
[1:17:51] fight because we don't want to come here
[1:17:52] for that I just want to remind you
[1:17:54] where's the last puzzle
[1:17:57] piece cuz we need to go
[1:17:59] home amenallah so I I will encourage you
[1:18:03] I got something to finish with so you
[1:18:04] don't all think I just made a gave you a
[1:18:06] pxl CU that's not what it's
[1:18:08] about yeah
[1:18:10] yeah there's a song that that a artist
[1:18:14] wrote and I think it's Casting Crowns
[1:18:16] and it says city on a hill and it says
[1:18:19] each one thought they knew
[1:18:21] better but they were different by Design
[1:18:25] instead of standing stronger together
[1:18:27] they let their differences
[1:18:30] divide what happened with these
[1:18:33] people he says they all made up their
[1:18:35] minds and they left it all behind they
[1:18:37] walked
[1:18:38] away they were sitting in church and
[1:18:41] they thought the guy next to him wasn't
[1:18:43] that gift that God could use and God's
[1:18:46] saying I want to prophesy he's saying I
[1:18:48] want to sing I want to dance I want to
[1:18:50] have knowledge and discernment and ab
[1:18:52] and or them shouldn't jump in the river
[1:18:55] somebody said don't jump in that over
[1:18:56] the waters too fast and all those things
[1:18:58] there's gifts in our church that God is
[1:18:59] warning and want to use but we're
[1:19:01] holding behind because we're not staying
[1:19:03] in his word and we're not
[1:19:05] fortified behind his word and God can
[1:19:08] only use you when you surrendered and
[1:19:10] how do you surrender I leave it with
[1:19:12] this how do you
[1:19:13] surrender you say Lord I'm sold out I
[1:19:18] have no will of my own I want your will
[1:19:20] just work through me I want to get that
[1:19:23] last one and then when you're at school
[1:19:25] and you walk into class the very first
[1:19:26] thing that's in your mind is who's the
[1:19:29] last one how can you help me Lord to
[1:19:31] reach that last
[1:19:32] one it's not a it's not a tool it's
[1:19:35] because you want to do it you don't have
[1:19:37] to do it you want to do it let me finish
[1:19:41] musicians you can come
[1:19:43] up it is quite hot up here leave
[1:19:47] over he says the trouble of it brother
[1:19:49] brandom Cy and zachi as the businessman
[1:19:51] and that's actually where it all came
[1:19:52] from is trouble of this is
[1:19:55] today we're not thirsty enough there is
[1:19:58] not enough thirst and hunger for the
[1:20:01] people I believe the church ought to be
[1:20:04] a little bit more saltier than what it
[1:20:07] is salt creates a thirst salt is a
[1:20:11] savior and it contacts but if the salt
[1:20:15] has lost its savior it's hence for no
[1:20:18] good for nothing and to become an
[1:20:23] organization that that's right but you
[1:20:26] got a little bit of savor in it and the
[1:20:29] Savor of the salt gives it its strength
[1:20:32] back he says if a man sees Christ Living
[1:20:35] in you it will make him thirst to be
[1:20:38] like you it will make him see Jesus in
[1:20:41] you it will make him see
[1:20:47] God so the puzzle piece is are they
[1:20:51] figuring out that they the last puzzle
[1:20:53] piece and are you figuring out that they
[1:20:56] the last puzzle piece do you treat them
[1:20:58] like the missing one and if you do you
[1:21:02] will come humbly behind and say Lord
[1:21:05] show me let me be a servant so that I
[1:21:07] can lift them into your presence so that
[1:21:09] they can meet you so that we all can
[1:21:11] become servants amen we can all just
[1:21:15] stand up there
[1:21:18] um brother Jimmy you can come forward
[1:21:21] too I I don't like I didn't preach it
[1:21:24] because I wanted to preach something
[1:21:25] strong I want you to realize that if we
[1:21:28] got used to just being us for no
[1:21:32] more then uh we're not going home that's
[1:21:36] the truth of it brother
[1:21:38] Jimmy and if you do find my puzzle
[1:21:41] pieces anyway please um just give it to
[1:21:44] Sister Chantel so we're just going to
[1:21:45] close quickly in a word of prayer can
[1:21:47] you see um play hide me now then hide me
[1:21:53] now okay
[1:21:55] amen bow your heads we just end in a
[1:21:56] word of prayer say Lord Jesus be before
[1:21:59] we going to sing tonight Lord uh I love
[1:22:03] you Lord and uh I know there's a lot of
[1:22:04] blind people out there Lord that's
[1:22:07] really just looking for you my lord and
[1:22:09] uh we sometimes get so busy with life
[1:22:11] that we forget to talk to those blind
[1:22:13] people we forget to to tell them what
[1:22:16] you have done in our life Lord Jesus you
[1:22:18] we forget to testify and say hey but God
[1:22:21] rich and mercy came my way one day and
[1:22:23] he and he saved me come and see we kind
[1:22:25] of get too scared of our religion we
[1:22:28] kind of get too ashamed of you Lord we
[1:22:30] can't pray for our our meal Lord and and
[1:22:32] we think that if we around people and we
[1:22:35] have to display some form of religion
[1:22:37] Lord that they would just rebuke us or
[1:22:40] they would make fun of us father but
[1:22:42] that Lord that shouldn't be the case
[1:22:44] Lord we should really just say Lord
[1:22:45] thank you for everything you do for us
[1:22:48] Lord because how would the blind man be
[1:22:50] able to see one day if nobody told him
[1:22:52] about you how would the lame be able to
[1:22:54] find strength if there's no testimony or
[1:22:56] witness Lord to go to and say hey I'm a
[1:22:59] bit lame I need help introduce me to
[1:23:02] Jesus how would the the ones with
[1:23:04] depression Lord Jesus get over it if
[1:23:07] there's nobody to go to them and say hey
[1:23:10] but I used to be depressed one day Lord
[1:23:13] how is that Miss puzzle piece going to
[1:23:15] come in father if the bride is just
[1:23:17] happy with where she's sitting tonight
[1:23:18] in her place all happy but forgetting
[1:23:22] Lord that there's one missing
[1:23:24] Lord and they're looking at the ones
[1:23:26] missing and everybody can see the ones
[1:23:27] missing but there's nothing that's being
[1:23:29] done to catch that one there's nothing
[1:23:31] that's being done to serve the one that
[1:23:33] needs the love and the
[1:23:36] help Father I ask that you would forgive
[1:23:38] us for this Lord because that's not why
[1:23:40] we're here Lord we're here because we
[1:23:42] love you and we want to Worship You Lord
[1:23:44] and we want to tell everybody about you
[1:23:46] father because the the change in our
[1:23:48] life we can see is so major lord it's so
[1:23:52] big father that we never walk the same
[1:23:54] way Lord when we wrestled with you the
[1:23:56] angel of the lord we wrestled Lord you
[1:23:58] touched us and we walked different but
[1:24:01] Lord sometimes we trying to hide the
[1:24:03] limp because we're scared we get told
[1:24:06] off or we get
[1:24:08] rebuked but Lord I ask that you would
[1:24:10] just help us Lord to to keep looking for
[1:24:13] that last puzzle piece Lord to keep
[1:24:15] pushing the battle Lord and pressing on
[1:24:18] Lord to look at each other in the Pew
[1:24:20] not like hey Lord work in his life but
[1:24:22] actually say Lord how can you use me
[1:24:24] to work in his life father to instead of
[1:24:27] saying oh I'm glad I'm not like this man
[1:24:30] to say Lord how can I help this
[1:24:33] man Lord Jesus change our attitude
[1:24:36] please father and the way we do things
[1:24:38] Lord so that we would be so mindful of
[1:24:40] and be used by you Lord and inspired in
[1:24:43] such a way Lord that we could speak a
[1:24:44] word in season father I know you've got
[1:24:48] many your gifts in this church itself
[1:24:50] father and they're laying dormant Lord
[1:24:52] because we're not surrendering them to
[1:24:54] you father I pray Lord that you would
[1:24:56] just help us and forgive us if we have
[1:24:59] Lord and help us to Le these gifts being
[1:25:01] on display Lord that you could work
[1:25:03] through US Lord not worrying about what
[1:25:05] the neighbor sees Lord but asking what
[1:25:07] you want us to do the will of the father
[1:25:10] Lord Jesus I ask that you would forgive
[1:25:12] us Lord just being so hard and cold and
[1:25:14] starchy some days and get used to rby
[1:25:18] and netball and cricket and all these
[1:25:20] other things that keeps us busy and
[1:25:22] running after our children but not
[1:25:24] running after the elected the ones
[1:25:27] that's there Lord father this world has
[1:25:29] got a great program to keep us busy Lord
[1:25:31] but we ask that you would remove that
[1:25:33] from our minds right now in the name of
[1:25:35] our Lord Jesus Christ Lord and that you
[1:25:37] would give us the purpose Lord to go
[1:25:39] preach this gospel and live this gospel
[1:25:42] and represent this gospel with every
[1:25:44] fiber of our beings Lord because Lord
[1:25:47] that's what we want to do is we want to
[1:25:49] represent this message with all of our
[1:25:51] fibers Lord this introduction to the
[1:25:53] living God Lord that gave us overcoming
[1:25:56] power the spoken word returned to man
[1:25:59] Lord let us not be busy with other
[1:26:01] things father I pray you'll forgive us
[1:26:03] if we
[1:26:04] was but I ask tonight Lord that you
[1:26:06] would just come once more Lord and just
