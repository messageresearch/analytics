seats this morning at the band and with isaac have a special force amen okay hello god bless you all um so the band have been practicing and um what what we've been working on our own songs because it's a bit more interesting than doing someone else's songs so um yeah each week we're practicing on some new new songs that we've written so this was this was one that actually we wrote some of it during the song service and then we've kind of worked on it and got the rest done you i think we tried to do it about two weeks ago a brother andy tried to do it didn't quite work but we've got the words up so what we're going to do is we're going to do it once and then we will teach it to you guys so you can sing the second time through and then we'll just carry on with the worship after that um we're going to do it twice this the faster version so let's just do the chorus once through like we'll just do it the same both times and during when song leaders thought they can do it how they want to and also there are words here that are interchangeable so the song leaders can whoever does it on the day can change the word that they want to change it to you'll know the song um so where's lataba is she you're singing what no no come on you gotta come up here and um debra so i want to try and do a fast song and a slow song every two weeks so next week in two weeks time out our new song we're going to teach you a fast one and then it's going to be a slow one fast slow so yep and then we want to for the song leaders too we want to try and keep these songs do these songs during the services so we can kind of learn them as well okay [Music] bring the words up too can you see that the words go on the right the son of god [Music] redeeming love you paid the price myself [Music]

the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not sorry and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest israel therefore i am come baptizing with water and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him brother braham says one of the most outstanding pieces of scripture right there god and man amen let's just bow here's the word of prayer this morning if you've got a knee just want to slip your hand up to the lord and let's just talk to him together shall we oh lord i just so thrills our souls we can say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name lord we're so thankful we can lord we know you you are our father lord you brought us to the earth lord jesus you've expressed us to the earth and you've made yourself real to us and lord is so glad lord we can say what condescension bring us redemption when in the lack of night no faint hope in sight lord you came lord when we could not come to where you were you came down to where we are oh god you reach down your hand for us lord i just want to give you thanks this morning we can gather one more time and worship and praise you lord we know many many churches around the world are unable to meet in this fashion lord because of because of covert 19 and lord just pray for all those who are affected by that virus and all sickness around the world lord i pray you touch each one for your glory and may they know that you are god and lord you just pray father lord that you would meet us here this morning may touch our lives lord i pray that you'll lord we know many times when it comes to operations on the body there can be tumors and cancers in certain parts of the body where the doctors say they are inoperable because the doctors can't reach it but i'm so thankful lord that there's no part of our being lord our body or our spirit any part of us that you cannot touch lord that's too difficult to you nothing is too difficult for you father so i pray you just reach down into places wherever we think cannot be touched may you touch us oh god change us and mold us and make us more like you lord you've seen the hands that have been raised lord you see the needs that everyone carries the burdens maybe the questions and different things lord i pray you would meet those needs because you know those needs lord you're not lord you are mindful of us in our situations and we thank you for that dear god i pray you bless each one here lord may you go touch those who couldn't be here today as well father maybe if they're sick and body or lord lord if they're traveling somewhere lord may be their portion today and we just want to commit the reading of your word into your hands lord i pray you bless the reading of your word as we've just read your word and may take the service under your divine control lord for your glory lord mate leave human control and go into your control we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so i want to speak about uh it's a very simple uh subject but i want to talk about becoming a lamb and um brother braham says this and uh i just want to jump to this as as i've said i don't like slideshows because they never start you know brother bram i'm sorry i think sister julie hazeldon put this on the sisters chat then christine sent it to me i thought it was very outstanding says you brother you say brother brown what is the way back to the old-fashioned meetings just become lambs again that's all just get back to being sheep the dove hasn't gone very far he's just waiting for a chance to get back there's the road back to azusa street now we'll talk about that later but you know we shouldn't shun when people say let's i would like to have azusa street we're not going back to azusa street because god has gone on but god doesn't take away he adds right we believe in justification but even a greater way than luther preached it and then he added sanctification but we believe in sanctification a greater way than weasley taught it because wesley just thought it's a human method to being sanctified but we know the blood of jesus christ cleanses us sanctifies us and we know we have the gifts of the spirit and we have the giver of the gifts as well hallelujah so there's a road back to azusa street that's the place back back to the azusa street meetings again it should turn to a lamb nature again so what's those old-fashioned meetings where god just takes over service leaves human control goes beyond what the notes are here or what we think or whatever and god just takes over that's that's the meetings we want and to me that's why we gather is not that because church is not to be man controlling man it's god controlling man amen says god is remember i'm really i think it was jason watkins said this he said so he's the pastor of his church but he said he's now the assistant pastor of the church because the pastor is jesus christ so in reality i'm just the assistant pastor of this church i'm not the one who's leading this deal and that's the lord jesus christ who is you know in in control but you know we want to go to have those meetings again where god just just takes over hallelujah so he said the way back to that is just to become a lamb again now there's this so i'll just throw that in there and we'll go back and we'll get there again and you know here we are so um anyone who reads fast don't read too fast now so jesus now brother braham said that this was the most outstanding one of the most outstanding pieces of scripture where god and man became one now we know that jesus he was the god man but by his blood amen god cleanses us in such a way that god can now come dwell on us once again and to me it's such an incredible thing we think that god can take take people where the bible says not one man seeks after god no not one it's not even in man's heart to seek after god and you know we we come into the world you know we're born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's putting a few scriptures together just condensing it and that's how we're fashioned that's how we're upon the earth but yet god and his infinite grace and mercy will cleanse the people in such a way that he can now dwell on the inside of the inside of them and he can live his life through them and now all the way down through the scripture god has had sheep it's not just new testament it's bad it's your old testament has been cheap as well but as if god and man can stay reconciled because jesus he never had a wolf nature he always had a lamb nature he was born with that nature because he was born without sin he was tempted on all points like we are but yet without sin he didn't have a fallen nature he did not need to be redeemed amen he was always a lamb but we are born with a jewel nature we have a wolf nature that we have with our first birth it doesn't matter how kind someone can be they still need redeeming and then once we're born again we receive a lamb nature we receive god's own nature but that wolf nature unfortunately this thing is still alive otherwise it would be six feet under somewhere you know there'll be a tombstone you know and and that's why we're looking for body changes because we want these bodies to be changed harley the guy you look in the mirror every morning i want this guy to be changed that's why the world is full of self-help books and different things well the best self-help book really is is the scripture i mean will you yield to it and say lord just change my nature change my life to match yours amen as the scripture says that we would be partakers of his divine nature and to be a partaker of his divine nature is not you trying to mold yourself into it it's not us trying to push ourselves into a form and say no i'm like jesus it's us surrendering to his word and he molds and shapes us you know sometimes that process can be very frustrating but you know eventually we get there you ever seen a little baby trying to roll over or crawl or walk or talk or there's there's moments of frustration but there's a desire i want to walk i want to be big you know i want to join my siblings and run around and you know and it can be like us we can see how the lord is in the word and you know and the message and and we can get frustrated ourselves but as long as we just remember if he started a work he's going to finish that work hello and he's real determined i'm going to have a people made in my image they're not going to be just a patch up job or you know sometimes we do a job and i'll confess sometimes we think well that's good enough and someone else comes along and says that's not good enough god's not that kind of good enough kind of god he's going to do a thorough work he's going to do a thorough that no one can say no that's not good enough it's good enough hallelujah so there's this battle now to to to stay as a lamb now you remember when you know if you if you read through church history you know god moved in a powerful way at azusa street we can't take away from that that was a work of god and for years before that the whole whole city of los angeles all the christians were actually praying for revival there was actually a great hunger and a thirst to see god live god was preparing people and then and then at um at azusa studio in the house in the zeus street mission god came down in a powerful way and it spread around the world but then what happened is man become to come in because remember god i mean the devil he doesn't want us to be rejoicing he doesn't want us to have camp meetings all the time he doesn't want himself to be cast out he wants to find a toehold somewhere because if he can have a toe hold you ever seen someone climbing like free climbing a cliff they really they go they test and they try the holes and especially those people that climb up some crazy hundreds of meters up they've got no harness and it's like a wall that's like this and they're you know they're they're they're looking for a grip that's like the devil in our lives he's looking for a place he can put his feet and get leverage and climb higher and you know so he doesn't like being thrown off the cliff but we love to see him being thrown off don't we that's why we have church we like to see him just get thrown off get out of here devil you you've been evicted hallelujah but you see he always tries to make it that he can get a toehold so so azusa street started off in power but it quickly turned into a denominational move where where the power of god basically left and it just just went everywhere but it wasn't the magnitude of was what it was at the beginning and why was that because there were lambs but then the enemy came in and brought up that wolf nature and it caused division and arguments and then and then it became not let god live and let god lead us into all truth of the scripture but it was now no i'm right and you're wrong and then what happened then the power of god lifted off because god does not dwell anywhere he how could how could you know jesus he was his nature of a lamb and the nature of the dove have same kind of natures what if john said behold the wolf of god that takes away the sin of the world jesus would have got baptized there wouldn't be no spirit of god descend upon him because the dove would look at him say i can't land there we got nothing in common hallelujah but those at azusa street when when when god put his spirit out they were lambs they were yielded they were hungry they they just got rid of all their mouths and strife and trouble whatever more and god said i can dwell on those people but then the enemy came in scattered all those things and like brother bam even said and christ is a mystery god revealed you know you're one big sweet humble group now but the devil's gonna bring someone and shoot them with poison spread it through the church cause divisions you know because the devil's not going to let you stay this way and he warned them that it would happen and it happened unfortunately just like paul would say in the book of ephesians he said i've been warning you for three years with tears that after my departure some among you are going to raise up and scatter the flock see and they were sitting under paul's ministry and he was warning this is going to happen but paul didn't know who it was he said but the devil's going to try and come in and destroy and that's what he does try to destroy but now the challenge is now can we stay surrendered to the lord that the devil tries to get a toehold in our lives and he just can't do it it's like we're teflon covered you know he just tries to grab and you know have you ever seen someone covered in grease or you try and grab them and it just doesn't work and you know we should be greasy by the holy ghost talia that the devil can't get a grip that's how we want to be hallelujah if that's safe that's how you get out of church i want to be greasy hallelujah you know we know we are his body upon the earth the apostle paul would say that uh that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us would who believe according to the working of his mighty power who he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right handed in the heavenly places far above all principality and power might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come you know i love that song you know not today i just think that quote brother says house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ hallelujah you know we know where the word of god is being manifested that is that is where the name of jesus christ is i mean so here in this place you can say you know when you come along you should be able to say the devil give way to the name of jesus christ basically give way to the spirit of god within me amen nothing can stand in his way as we just read there everything in this world next world amen it must bow to the name of jesus christ that's why we shouldn't have to put up with anything of the devil hallelujah amen and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all you know to me if something fills something it's full you know this bottle is not full there's a gap but if it was full it would be full and there's no room for anything else in this bottle if it's full of water so so that no oil can go on there nothing can go on there because it's full so if we're filled with the goodness of god there ain't no room for nothing else amen there's no room for gossip for malice for strife for ill feeling funny feeling towards one another you know you know contention river maybe i'm sorry i'm full the devil tries to give give you some box of rattlesnakes of gossip or hatred malice you know whatever say sorry the house is full you know you look around i know brother cabin probably has the trouble with his warehouse he looks around this place is full where is this going to go and he has to make it fit because it's stuff he ordered but when his stuff he maybe didn't order he said sorry return it to sender there's no place for it hallelujah same thing with the devil he tries to give you sickness gives you trouble gives you whatever you say i'm sorry i didn't order this and my house is full hallelujah glory now um noah here would send out two birds when you know after the flood while the waters are receding and he and he and he sends out two birds to see if there's dry land and he sends out a raven he sends out a dove now notice that he so so he seemed for the raven which went to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth and he sent a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the earth so so these birds are sent out to see is there anywhere to rest is there any light you know is there anywhere where these ones can land and if they can well they will and if not they'll come back now the dove found no place for the soul of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were in the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark so now this raven we know it's a scavenger they're a bunch of dead stuff have you ever seen a flood after a flood you know there's you know there's silt and there's dead animals and you see like a flood go through farmland all the sheep and cows that drowned are pushed against fences and there's debris and it's just death now a raven would fly out no doubt because he's stuck in the zaki flies out and says oh boy i'm going to have a good time all the things i wanted to eat now i'm going to eat them go eat a giraffe and whatever and you know and because but the reason that he didn't have to come back to the ark is because he could be identified with that death because his nature was i'm a scavenger i can eat anything that's dead doesn't matter what it is he can just have a big time you know filling his belly because the nature of the raven was associated with dead things but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot because the nature of the dove does not does not match with death he saw the same bloated maybe dead cattle beast the raven saw the raven said here's breakfast the dove said that's not breakfast i can't eat it i'm not built my nature does not associate with this dead animal but the ravens did so you know you know his brother umpol was preaching on wednesday to me it was tremendous about hunger and the hunger of the raven was satisfied with dead rotting things because it's hunger because it's nature manifested in a hunger so its nature was for dead things so that so that transferred to a hunger and wanted to eat dead things so so its hunger was satisfied with dead riding things but the but the nature of the dove was not of death so it couldn't associate with hunger for dead things so it couldn't eat them they could not find a place you know that that raven could rest on the dead cattle beast there's a good place to rest the dove said i can't sit i can't put my claws on that thing and i had to take his flight so dove the dove could not find rest with dead things and it couldn't eat dead things see the dove was looking for signs of life now remember he's the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and the spirit of god descended upon him like a dove right so here is now you can say the spirit of god going upon the earth to look for a place to rest as as he said in the book of isaiah heaven is my throne earth is my footstool but where's the place of my rest and we could say here i am lord i'm the place of your rest the soul of man is the place for god to rest so this dove was looking for a place to rest but it found no place because it was looking for signs of life now it's to me it's interesting that the dove would would find an olive leaf and pluck it off now we know no no this is just me and my mind but you know we know that we are the wild olive grafted into the tree you know just as you know israel's a natural natural olive branch was pulled out and we were grafted in so now the dove representing the holy ghost came to where the olive tree is hallelujah so now that dove so we should be an olive tree right where the spirit of god can descend and abide and find rest hallelujah i mean so so the dove found a place to rest eventually which was that olive tree a place of life but the raven already found a place which was dead things now as you know the spirit of god can only associate with life not with death not with blackness and skulls and all that dark stuff which you see out there god kind of god that is not god being identified right he says i can't you know but he only associates with life and we know life grows it has a force behind it you know actually you know it's wholesome it grows it matures it gets more and more it doesn't it doesn't decay you know death just decays and rots and gets worse but life actually increases now i said that god has always had lambs moses i i just use this example moses was to me one of the first lambs but he had to get into a condition you know harry so this is him and you know and you think what an incredible process god had to put him through to get to this spot here he is this is after mount sinai and god spoke with them they've come through the red sea all those things have happened and he says now moses was very meek above all the men which are upon the face of the earth so he so so he was a very meek man but he didn't start off this way can you imagine being raised as the prince of the house of egypt being the meekest man in all the earth no because remember pharaoh was considered a god he was the god of the egyptians manifested in human flesh he was a god to them so you think this you know the man who could potentially be the next pharaoh do you think he'd be a meek fellow here make way for moses prince of egypt and all the trumpets and he walks out carries himself like he's you know made of gold and you know that's not a meat kind of man proud and he has a personality where people look at him say this is more than a man amen but he had to come to a place after 40 years on the back side of the desert with a high tempered wife and all this trouble and different things going on god knows how to mold us you know we're we may be going through real troubles in time god's molding and god's working hallelujah you know brother brown would preach a sermon called the unchanging god coming in an unexpected way unexpected time and he says normally when trouble sets in that's when that unchanging god is going to meet you you know brother brown would say he'd go out in the woods he'd pray and you know the birds would chatter too much and the mosquitoes would bite them and different things going on and he said i know when that's happening god's about to speak hallelujah because the devil's trying to distract and all these troubles goes on and you know he's praying you're the mosquitoes land he just says fill up boys come and have your fall because i'm going to be praying hallelujah no i wouldn't recommend that necessarily but you know but but what he's saying basically is he wasn't going to allow those distractions you know i was i was sitting here last night preparing and and i i literally nodded off a couple of times just there and i and i i just i just pray i said i rebuked the spirit of tiredness i'm not going to fall asleep here and i just became wide awake again you know i'm not going to fall asleep well i'm glad anyway but you know we shouldn't you know we should expect trouble you know oh hardship's here well god's trying to get to us but the devil's trying to ward off his visitation i mean so moses after to me after he met the lord in the burning bush he became the meekest man in all the earth because because what happened was moses received the law by revelation he didn't go to a school you know god did not tell moses now moses go up to jerusalem and there's a bible school there and you're going to learn this course and you're going to get this degree and then you can go deliver the people no he met god he met the one who gave the promise to abraham he met the god that same god was come to fulfill the promise he said moses you're here to fulfill the promise i've come down i've heard the cry of my people i've come down i'm sending you to do the job so because moses had all the excuses i can't speak i can't do this i can't do that and god just got mad at him who made the mouth to speak many times we say how can i ever be the bride of christ who made the bride of christ amen who's who's the workman working on the house you know we get frustrated our humanity and our troubles we have our ups and downs and rounds abouts and trust me i have a lot of them you know you look at yourself and say lord why he said well no no don't ask why just say thank you thank you you called me hallelu thank you you called me amen hallelujah so you know moses because he received the law by revelation he became the meekest man in all the earth because remember to have a meek character like this that's part of the character of christ so when someone receives revelation you'll see the character of christ coming out of them in a greater way hallelujah that's why we should pray for revelation revelation is not just a whole bunch of learning you retain in your mind right it actually produces the character of christ in our lives you say well what about the scribes and pharisees well they were proud arrogant men because they just went to a bible school they didn't meet the god that gave the law you know hallelujah so that's why we don't want to be we should study the bible study the message but let it become a revelation it will produce a character of christ in us hallelujah so moses became a lamb now we know there were parts of his life where he stayed a lamb where god told god told him i'm going to wipe out israel i'm sick of them and i'll start with you and he stood in the gap saying lord blot my name out of the book that was being a lamb he was standing in the gap for the people he knew all their trouble he knew all their fusses he didn't say to god god they're really not that way he said just block me out lord instead of taking them that's a real lamb stand in the gap remember jesus was our lamb he's our sin barrier he stood in the gap for you and i he's our advocate today he's still standing in the gap for you or not his blood is still there for you and i hallelujah he's our intercessor he's our mediator he is working on your behalf hallelujah hallelujah so you know but then there were times where he reverted back to a wolf he got mad at the people you bunch of rebels do i have to get water out of this rock and he took the rod and he smoked the rock he's meant to speak to it why because he reverted to that wolf nature now that's just under the blood of bulls and goats under the blood of bulls and goats he could never be free of that wolf nature but under the blood of jesus christ that's why so it's so wonderful maybe there's a line of temper in your family you don't have to live with that or unforgiveness or indifference whatever you don't have to live with that kind of thing jealousy whatever it may be you don't have to live with that kind of thing because the blood can take it from you highly aware where you know the things you once did you do them no more you know just like brother braham said yeah he said he was part irish high tempered passionate and before he met the lord he wanted to kill some boys who beat him up who knows the story but the gun wouldn't go off amen and then there was that you know but then the lord saved him years later and then there was that guy who and i mean but also before he met the lord there was that man who killed one of his dogs and his dad actually stopped him because he got the same well probably the same rifle he wasn't and he was going to go after him to kill him and his dad stopped him doing it but then after he met the lord he led that same antichrist hallelujah hallelujah amen i'm glad the lord is working on me i need work you know you know some you know i joke about william having a grumpy face i said it got it from my side of the family i don't necessarily mean feel grumpy i just get this look so never judge a book by its cover you know he's having a bad day i could be having the greatest i'm just focused on something i've got to do this and do this and do this and i get that you know anyway praise the lord we'll get there one day hallelujah i'm glad we're going to be in heaven eh this thing will be you know all the all the troubles and trials will be out of the way and we'll be we'll be surrounded you know we'll surround the great king of glory's throne and hallelujah that's going to be soon amen hallelujah so moses became a lamb now joshua had to become a lamb as well amen that's the only way see he tried in his human ability thinking he was already commissioned and joshua won be strong and very courageous as i was with moses i'm going to be with you now in order for him to be with joshua as he was with moses joshua would have to get into the same condition moses was in amen that's why you see this you know there comes times in the scripture where there's a cycle of revival and death and the reason death comes after revival is the people don't stay in revival and it's to to stand revival is a condition of the heart it's not going through motions and doing the same kind of thing it's the condition of the heart will bring we'll keep a revival going on and we're living in the bride's revival the books openers and we have all things but you know this is not a time of just a three years of you know i was told you'll only have revival for three years and i just sort of my little head that may be your experience you know people try and give you their experience yeah and you know and i just say well that hasn't been my experience you know you're like yo the devil always tries to give you his experience you'll never make it well why not he can't make it you you can't forgive those people why not because he can't forgive those people you know you'll never get to heaven you're never going to rapture why because he got kicked out of heaven he can't go into rapture so he tries always to give you his experience i say devil stop trying to give you my experience i mean stop trying to give me your experience i've received the experience of the lord jesus christ holy so i'm going to walk according to that experience amen jesus went up into heaven i'm going up into heaven and then jesus conquered hell death in the grave and because he did i'm going to conquer it hallelujah so i'm going to live according to his experience you know jesus has never done anyone wrong man has done people wrong sure but the lord has never done any wrong hallelujah and we come you know i don't come to church to worship you guys i come to worship the lord jesus christ i mean so i'm going to worship according to what he has done for me and not what other people have done to me because jesus has never done me wrong he's never hurt me he's never been mean to me he's never you know tried to put a complex on me he's always tried to do me right and he always has amen isn't that true saved me when i was lost he kept me on the road i wanted to deviate he put me back on the road again i mean he corrected me when i needed correction he delivered me when i needed deliverance hallelujah heal me when i was sick aiming i mean he's done so much hasn't he so you know i think we should just worship god according to who god is hallelujah hallelujah amen the world's falling apart well should my should my walk with god fall apart no that should just get stronger hallelujah amen so joshua had to get into the same condition that moses did in order for him to continue on the ministry of moses so so here here is joshua he's walking around jericho i know you all know the story really well but no doubt he's trying to figure out how am i going to take the city and then the one who actually was there to lead the whole campaign just comes down and josh are asking me for forrester against it says no i'm not for you i'm not against you i've come to take over i remember the only way and then look what look what joshua did and joshua fell on his face on the earth hallelujah hallelujah lord shave off my own human ability shave off what i think we should do shave off my plan to take jericho i want to receive your plan to take jericho lord and not just jericho but the whole of our walk into the promised land as the same thing with you and i you know we've got a rapture to take hallelujah we've got devil to overcome we've got unbelief to cast out amen we've got we've got promises to obtain hallelujah so how's it going to be done and then the lord comes down and said lord share off my ideas i mean share all of me take all my rights everything i am hallelujah make me a lamb that you can manifest yourself through my life hallelujah isn't it incredible where god will take a people you think about we are his body amen we are a channel you think about the bride of jesus christ the believer is a channel for god to work through upon the earth highly aware you know you you read the book of acts the incredible things god did you know god could have done it himself but he sent them and he lived through them however the incredible things that they did amen raise the dead cast out devils healed the sick i mean saw visions had visitations of angels god came down upon the earth through their through those people's lives and i'll say we are the same way amen because remember this the believers around the world are writing another book of acts i mean this is not a not another book of act i mean this is not something else this is the same book of acts being rewritten where god is doing the same things hallelujah casting out devils healing the sick raising the dead the name of jesus christ is magnified people receive the holy ghost lives are changed hallelujah i mean when you read the book of acts i trust you can say i've had that experience and i've had that experience hallelujah like when the when the uh enemy brought them before a council tried to intimidate them don't preach anymore in the name of jesus christ they were beaten whatever more and you know the devil trying to put a complex on them don't witness no more don't live this life no more you stop doing what you're doing stop believing this message and then they went and had a prayer meeting and god came down and filled them shook the place and they went out with boldness hallelujah i'm sure you've had that kind of experience i mean with devil says stop believing this just do what everyone else is doing i said no i'm going to do what heaven's doing hallelujah it's worth that's a that's a good wicket to be on hallelujah so you know who said that kind of thing that's from the book of acts who's seen the devil cast out that's from the book of acts seen people be baptized named lord jesus christ that's the book of acts people's lives transform book of acts hallelujah amen because the power of god has put us forth and and we'll get to the quotes on that and the god is writing another book of acts and i love the book of acts because it's the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles it's not the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles and this book of acts is the axe of the holy ghost and the bride hallelujah i like that don't you amen so he fell down on his face to the earth and did worship him he says loose thy and then we're just down to verse 15. loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where and thou standers is holy and joshua did so that's the same commandment that moses was given amen so joshua had to become a lamb hallelujah now the lord we know jesus was a man but he's also god right he had to be he had to be fully manned because he had to be a kinsmen redeemer to become one of us to redeem us from under the curse of the law from under the power of sin right but only god could do it no man could keep the law no man could be sinless and actually be the perfect lamb no one could do it but only god becoming a man but so as a man he was led he says but jesus answered them my father worketh here unto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but also said that god was his father making himself equal with god then answered jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he saith the father do what things soever he doeth there also doeth the sun likewise so jesus was led by vision that's why when he went to the pool of bethesda and he saw the one man who was there for i know how long he was led by vision to that one man he stepped over cripples and different ones and he went to that one man he's led by vision hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i we see the father do then we do hallelujah amen but he had to stay remember jesus could have really been a very bitter man he had the right you know he had a he had a bad name to begin with because joseph met you know normally the firstborn looks really like the father the most everyone's got yes really isn't that right but jesus i don't believe would have looked like joseph because god was his father so you know so oh definitely mary was with a roman soldier and this is how this you know jesus came and all these things he you know he lived with that kind of black name everyone forsook him the ones he you know he came to his own his own received him not right he died of a broken heart he was a man acquainted with grief right isaiah 53 so he knew grief really well if you're acquainted with someone you build a relationship so unfortunately he built a relationship with grief he's a man of sorrow tears in agony but yet he could walk in such a way that none of those things actually hindered him to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him it didn't matter what people said about him what his enemies wanted to do he knew they wanted to kill him and they knew that he knew they would kill him amen but none of those things crippled his walk with god if i put it that way you know he cursed the fig tree he could have he could have wiped jerusalem off the map he could have done it he could have turned carefully he could just made them all disappear sent them straight to hell he could have done it but he didn't do it now jesus says i'm the good shepherd and i know my sheep and i am known and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so i know the father and laid down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd yeah i read this i thought i'm in the bible hallelujah because i'm one of the other sheep holly had to come find me you're sure i was 2000 years down the road but there i was hallelujah bleeding in the wilderness somewhere just scrambling around he said no i've got other sheep and he was thinking of you when he was speaking these words too hallelujah hallelujah because he knew on the inside of the insider he was a sheep nature doesn't matter what your natural birth yo yo you inherited from your natural birth on the inside the inside he's a sheep nature hallelujah remember we don't come to christ because we're perfect i didn't become a you know no christian becomes a christian because they're exactly like jesus they're they're just this word being manifested and then i'll make them a christian now no it doesn't work that way we come basically you know his brother johnny de moff said a wool um yo yo sheep with a pig skin wrapped around them who remembers that you know the you know hallelujah and you know we come that way you know we come with that kind of nature but your god knows that we'd come this way and he doesn't hold us hold it against us he knows on the inside of the inside of us we have a sheep nature it's just got to come to life but a sheep must stay a sheep now this is probably very elementary but it doesn't matter what nation you go to under heaven a man marries a woman this is traditional marriage and a woman marries a man you can't i can't marry that keyboard i can't marry my i don't have a dog was just having i can't marry a dog i've got to marry the same species as me amen and it doesn't matter if just say you take i don't know what the cultures would be but you take two cultures and races upon the earth that a polar opposite and tradition and everything and outlook they can still get married right because we're all the same so like has to marry like right as i said i can't marry the synth i can't marry that plant i can't can't marry a dog i have to marry female i'll go i gotta marry a human right so now if the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready we're in verse seven that like has to marry like so jesus is looking he's the male lamb he's looking for a female lamb so he's looking for the same nature this is what he's looking for just like the dove coming down upon the lamb of god they had the same kind of nature he's looking for a people that have his nature hallelujah and he gives us his nature by his grace by the working of his spirit in our lives but you know so we so this is why we have to become lambs amen hallelujah i'm not saying we're not lambs right but we have to become lambs and stay lambs because the battle is not necessarily becoming a lamb the battle is staying a lamb that's the challenge of the christian walk because you know we know if you've been filled with the holy ghost you're on your way to heaven right you're sealed into the day of your redemption amen you can't be lost you can't even miss the rapture because you've been sealed in to the day of your redemption no one can break that seal the devil can't break the seal remember brother kaija at camp with the seal he said you know nothing can this one's pretty much full but you know nothing can break the seal if the seal is unbreakable so the devil can try and break that seal off your life he he can't do it so in terms of eternal security i believe in eternal security if you're eternally secure in christ you're eternally secure in christ but now the difference is now so so i trust all the fear should go out of that am i going to make it well if you're part of the word for today if the holy ghost is in you you can't miss it right you can't you have to go but the amount of victory you have in your christian walk is up to you right so the amount of victory if you want to kill every devil that comes against you or you want him to beat you up it's up to you and it's up to if you stay a lamb if you become a wolf i want all the victory i can get amen right why not hallelujah why not why not conquer everything that can be conquered you know why not take every devil that should be under our feet and put him under our feet and if he moves just stand on his head again hallelujah if unbelief comes in cast it out doubts worry strife whatever it may be just get rid of it we can by the blood i can do all things through christ jesus which strengthens me and to me that doesn't mean i'm going to win the 100 at the olympics i don't care about that i'm running a real race that race is for glory i mean so if he says we can do all things through christ i can do all things how i can overcome all things hallelujah amen by his spirit i'm glad i'm glad we serve an unlimited god you know there's not he's not a limited god he's unlimited in his ability and his power amen brother abraham says in church in its condition i'm just trying to find a screen that i can read off you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature and i was just speaking naturally i believe loving has to unite with love a husband and a wife has to love one another if they'll ever make the grade family has to love one another if they ever make the grade something to be loved you search everywhere finding a girl to be a wife that you love she searches finding a husband that she could love god searches trying to find a soul that he can love so he represented think about that god's searching for someone to love him infinite god who knows all things he's searching across the globe trying to find someone will you love me and and and i just think of my little two inches here how could you not love him how could he not give you all to this great one who just you know he's not a mean god he's not a god of we know he is a god of wrath but he's not a god of wrath i don't know him as a god of wrath i know i'm a god of mercy and grace and love and forgiveness and you know stability and that's how i know amen so you know god searches trying to find a soul that he can love so he represented himself here on earth as a gentle dove and a gentle lamb now if that lamb would be one minute ever taken on the nature of a snarling wolf that dove would have took her flight immediately she would have got away now another thing the lamb is the lamb is willing to submit its rights now god wants us to be lambs but there's so many times we don't want to submit our rights forfoot our rights so many of you say well i've got rights brother barum that's true but are you willing to fulfill your rights are you willing to give your rights that god could lead you that's what's the matter with our churches today in the great majority that the gentleness of the lamb of god we are supposed to be lambs we're supposed to be every um but we have become everything else but lambs that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude the dove of the holy spirit takes her flight and leaves what kind of rights are you talking about i'm not necessarily talking about here and dressing all those things and about you so i have a right to hold this against this person this person did me wrong this these people did me wrong i have a right to hold it against them that kind of attitude wherever if the lamb of god would have made the first snail like a wolf or done anything contrary to what the gentle dove would have permitted the dove would have took her flight she would have left in a minute and that's the reason today we're wondering what's the matter with the pentecostal church i could say what's the matter with the message church if i can bring it on home it's because we have taken on a different nature we have taken on a nature that we want our rights we're going to do what we know that's right to do and we become arrogant we become hostile we become indifferent we let temper come in we let selfishness come in that pretty much just covers everything well i'm not egg um i'm not arrogant but what about being indifferent what are being what about being hostile you know being hostile is not necessarily punching someone in the face you can have a hostile attitude towards someone and you can hold that you know things against we become indifferent and different to who to the lord we let temper come and we let selfishness come in now these these wolves are not smiling we show teeth when we smile dogs don't when they show teeth they're not smiling they're not happy these these wolves are snarling and this is where it can become where fellowship can be around something that's always negative have you heard what brother so-and-so did and sister so said this and this person oh that one you saw then why did you go see them and it's all like negative stuff and what have they got people become like wolves snarling kind of nature and all it is is to take a carcass of someone and tear them limb from limb we don't want to become this kind of people yeah but the challenge is you know not to become these kind of people because can you imagine the dove of the holy ghost resting on these guys you know you can't it just wouldn't work he wouldn't come close it's the same thing we don't want to let hostile yeah we don't want to become indifferent let temper come and let selfishness come in we don't want to become this way remember we want to see god live who wants to see jesus live that's what to me those old-fashioned meetings brother brown is talking about is when god takes supreme control of the people and god manifests himself how he wants to manifest himself i mean because you you look at if the books come open the whole contents of the book has come open then he wants to manifest to hold much not just justification not just sanctification not just the gifts of the spirit amen but the fullness of himself filling all in all hallelujah amen isn't that what he wants to do so we don't want to become like this you know it can it can start so easy just with a sideway sideways remark about someone you know these wolves now this is how a lot of i think humanity just remembers people these wolves they look like they're angry they're fussing they're fighting what if these wolves were actually actually fully domesticated and they and actually have the nicest nature that'll that a dog could ever have excuse me like i was saying like we had a labrador growing up golden labrador and you could body slam him you could push him around you could do all kinds and he just took it he never bit no one he was gentle he was kind you know but but so what if they actually had that kind of nature but the only way we remember these wolves is like this they're vicious they're biting they're angry you know and this is how a lot of people remember other people they remember like a photograph of how they once were and they think they're still the same isn't that right we don't want we don't want to remember people by how they maybe were what about how they are now and then when you meet them you got this image in your mind they're like this and they don't like me and they think this of me and they're arrogant and they're maybe a bit bit bit short with their words and you know what if they're different because remember haven't we changed we're not a static image eh you know our i trust we become more like the lord we're more like him every day we you know the word puts on flesh in a greater way and you know so we're not a static image why would why should we remember other people as a static image you know and and to me it's you know astounding where sometimes people have more faith that god can speak to someone who's a prodigal or a sinner out in the world who's not it has no fellowship with god people have more faith to pray for those kind of people than they do for believers that's right you know don't you think god would have greater ability or it would be easier for him to talk to someone who's walking with him right but some you know for some reason believers get in their mind that it's easier for god to speak to someone who has no fellowship with him who's far from god and god can deal with them easier than god can deal with believers we shouldn't have that kind of attitude you know what does it help snarling over someone's carcass what about slipping away and praying for them shouldn't that be the right answer have you heard about what this is doing what these people are doing i'm really not interested you know i always well maybe i joke to myself i say i'm not part of the grapevine it kind of stops about here i just never connect you know have you heard down the grape i know well it kind of doesn't there's a there's a gap and i don't want to build that gap i'm pretty happy just whatever's going on let it go on you know we should just just walk with the lord and if people try and bring up stuff while you i think it's a good idea saying well have you prayed for those people have you really left the you know brother braham says it one no mortal can condemn another mortal in the presence of god so when you really go into the prince of god see many times people become like this is because the lack of the spirit of god in their lives because the spirit of god makes us gentle humble meek loving makes me love everybody the old-time religion right but when people leave the spirit of god they become like this their first nature begins to rise again because they're no longer feeding the inner man amen so you know that's why it should be the question well have you slept away and prayed for them because if you're only in the prince of god how can you condemn someone maybe they've just just blatantly just murdered your character around the whole globe and you know they did and they know they did but when you get into the prince of god and you how can you condemn that person when the one who forgave you of all things you're now in his presence hallelujah see if we just stand the prince of god you think lord you're so great i want to be a lamb i don't want to be a wolf i don't want to have my indifference or whatever against anyone i just want to i want to be loving i want to be gentle i just want to turn the other cheek i don't want to yo they want to steal my coat i give them the other one you know hallelujah it says engrave not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed and to the day of redemption he says before this let him not steal that stole still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give it to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceedeth out of your mouth you talk negative about someone else that's corrupt communication that's not just swear words but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers we know grace it means a divine influence upon the heart and its reflection on the life so we want to speak things that are good use of edifying that it would actually minister the divine influence of god upon the person's hearts amen he says and grieve not the holy spirit of god where by your seal to the day of your redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now i've seen i you know i like to just look at definitions of words and you know this word bitterness it actually means a uh um accelerate um acidity especially a poison so it talks about bitterness so talk about gossip put that away it's just a poison and wrath and anger and clamor clamors and outcries like a tumult of grief it's just a bunch of noise and evil speaking put it away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you so he says don't grieve the holy ghost so we can grieve him but he says but whereby your seal to the day of your redemption so just to grieve him doesn't mean you need to receive the holy ghost again but you can grieve and the brother bram says because he's like a dove who just go up into the rafters and you'll be walking on but he's waiting for you to get back into the right condition again that he can come and make his abode again as i said it doesn't change your eternal destination but it will change the victory you have in your christian walk hallelujah because remember god gives us choices amen you know we don't have to pray continuously god should i have breakfast today or should i have lunch or dinner or what should i eat you know he he allows you to make those choices and if you make the choices that you just you know live on mcdonald's that's your choice you know oh i need prayer i'm sick well why are you sick well i've been eating this well that's why you're sick it's not a supernatural thing it's just you making the wrong choice so you know god makes gives us choices but we shouldn't grieve the holy spirit he says and that's the only animal that a dove could sit on which is a lamb what if that lamb would have snorted like a wolf the gentle little dove would have taken her flight and you wonder what's the matter with the prayer meetings when you got saved you was a lamb but when you started snorting like a wolf and hating your neighbor and fussing and fighting the dove just took her flight and went away from you and now you wonder what's the matter that's what's the matter if a dove won't stay on if a dove won't stay on a goat it won't stay on a wolf fussing fighting steering ups and downs and arguing and denominational barriers the holy spirit just took her flight you say brother bram how do we get it back just come back to a lamb she's just sitting up there on the roof somewhere she'll come back right i shall come right back when you take the nature of a lamb this is what i opened up before what's the way back to the old-fashioned meetings just become lambs again just get back to being sheep the dove hasn't gone very far he's just waiting a chance uh to get back there's the road back to azusa street brother is preaching i think the 50th year anniversary of that there's a place back back to the azusa street meetings again is to return to a lamb nature again now jesus says i'm the true vine and my father is a husbandman i won't be much longer i don't think every branch that is in me beareth not fruit he taketh away in every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit he says and ye are now clean through the wood try spoken unto you he says abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except that abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i the vine the other branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing and he says herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so that so you shall be my disciples so the father hath loved me as i have loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's command commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full what's he just said you're the branches and i'm the vine and i'm gonna give you my life i'm gonna pulsate my life through and bear fruit amen that's why that's why your joy that's why our joy will be full amen now and now how will he be known how will we know him by his nature what he does his works he said i so he's not known by argument he's known by his nature by his works and he said i am the vine yeah the branches now the branch bears the fruit not the vine the vine energizes the branch and if the branch ever brings forth or the vine brings forth a branch it has grapes on it the next vine comes out or a branch out of that vine will have grapes on it if the first church that came off of that vine was a pentecostal church with all the gifts if that ever puts forth on another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it and that's what they had in the days of the apostles and the apostolic age has never ended that's in 1964 after the seals were open he says here he says the church has got so many orders and things to keep us so busy prayer meetings is left out we need to draw nigh unto god so he'll draw nigh unto us friend that's right but everything else has took the place of the prayer meeting everything else has took the place of the real spiritual worship oh maybe two or three minutes in church but i just love to lay and bathe before him don't you love that oh just lift up your hands and drink from the fountain until you can't drink no more but bubbling over in his sweetness and his and in his goodness hallelujah he just get so full of his goodness he says now i was talking so i don't really think this very well i was talking to a noted evangelist my brother t.l osborne um he said i was thinking brother braham of how that my whole objective is to save souls and to give all my time to save souls to christ i said then i happen to think what about my own love and devotion to christ christ loves him too he loves us we put a lot of time in things but god wants us to come apart and just sit down and worship him and talk with him and talk it over i love that oh that sweetness that's the greatest time of anybody's life is just sit down and meditate take everything off your mind if you would do that there wouldn't be so much nervousness around the country if we would just think on god hallelujah draw nigh unto me and i'll draw nigh unto you you ever got to that place you know you think about the lord and his goodness you know all the stress just seems to leave all the trouble seems to leave and the nervousness and and i need to do this i'm busy with this and this is going on here and what about these people here it's just all leaves because you're in the prince of the king hallelujah amen there's a psalm here psalm 45 sorry i'm just rushing through these it says to the chief musician upon um for the sons of korra uh michelle a song of loves says my heart is in in indicting a good if you if this is a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king now this word indicting here or ending or heavy say it means to gush so he's saying here my heart is gushing a good matter this guy's full hallelujah he's full of goodness yes he's not just sitting there and thinking well i'm going to write some things no his heart's bubbling there's a gushing coming forth there's a price coming for there's a worship coming forth and he's going to pet it down he's full of the goodness of god hallelujah and when something is being is is gushing it's not forced out there's a force behind it pushing yes amen have it you know there's something pushing out causing it to gush and it's because something is flowing in yeah you know you never see the hut river about to burst its banks when it's been sunny for more than you know it's it's because water's coming in it makes the water levels come up i mean you see waterfalls the reason waterfalls get great is because something's being poured in holla and it gushes out i mean it's the same thing with you and i something should be pouring in i mean the holy ghost should be pouring in i mean not just a little localized revival here and here but now we're part of the inexhaustible fountain of christ he's on the inside the inside of us and these are gushing out hallelujah there's a bubbling stream coming out hallelujah isn't that right with the word you just get so full of the goodness of god are you so happy about it hallelujah i mean you ever seen water gushing out of a dam that's full this pud just paused anything down on the rocks it's gonna get washed away hallelujah should be the same thing with us yeah the devil tries to put his mold and his mildew and his stuff and little rocks and you know frogs and stuff in the bottom and you know but then there's a gushy cup it just sweeps it all all away mouths and strife and tries to make camp no no you're not making camp here you're going to get washed away hallelujah that's how it should be you know our hearts should be so full of his goodness nothing else can fit amen hallelujah amen thou prepares the table before me in the prince of my enemies they are anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over hallelujah so it goes to show it doesn't matter what's going on around you david didn't say they'll prepare us a table before me in my stronghold where there's no enemies where everything's fine everyone loves me no no they'll prepare us a table for me in the prince of my enemies so with those people who want to kill me they hate me they don't think very highly of me you're gonna put a table right there lord and i'm gonna feast and i'm gonna enjoy it i'm going to praise you and my cup's going to run over hallelujah because why he gets full of the goodness of god when i think of the goodness of jesus and all that he has done for me my soul cries out hallelujah thank god for saving me hallelujah that's the way back to becoming a lamb you just think about how good he is hallelujah amen i waited patiently for the lord he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit i was in a slimy horrible pit oh boy out of the mirey clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god how there many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to us would they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more that can be remembered hallelujah you think of testimonies you know it's sometimes just too many amen hallelujah god's just done so much he's been too good glory hallelujah you know someone used to sing i think we sung it this morning count your many blessings name them one by one someone you say count your many blessings name them ton by ton amen hallelujah i think that's true we've got many many many blessings do we not he's been so good to us and if he's so good to us why should we hold or carry anything that's contrary to his word amen why should we hold you know lord help me now but we should be able to think about anyone upon the earth and think of them in the same way right so even our greatest enemy if you have an enemy or your greatest critic if you've got a critic or your best friend or your spouse you should be able to think about the love you have you shouldn't have any ill feeling you just name a name shouldn't be any ill feeling it should just be i actually love that person it doesn't matter what they've done to me i love that person oh there should be there shouldn't be any ill feeling towards anyone because those ill feelings cause causes to turn into snarling wolves hallelujah you say can you really live in such a way that you love everybody absolutely amen the love of god is about now in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us you can walk in that love you can be drunk on the spirit of god every day until you leave this world where everything's just good god is good all the time doesn't matter what's happening god is good oh these people hate me but god is good and because he loved me and his love's in my heart how could i not love them how can i not want the best for them how could i not want them to be in heaven with me hallelujah [Music] well i don't feel that way while i say friend you need a sharing remember real forgiveness is to surrender the right to hold that against somebody if you really forgive them you actually surrender the right to hold it against them that's real forgiveness that's just saying i forgive you brother i forgive you sister praise the lord and in reality you got a knife you know no no no well that's really what people do that's not forgiveness that's just putting up a facade we don't want to have a facade we don't want to have a church or a message face or whatever we want to be what we are in our hearts we want to be on the outside hallelujah so we need a sharing on the old fashioned meetings again and and i place myself in this too i've been crying thinking about this lord shave me off lord i want the i want you to live i stood by a sink when i first got saved the love of god filled my heart i said
