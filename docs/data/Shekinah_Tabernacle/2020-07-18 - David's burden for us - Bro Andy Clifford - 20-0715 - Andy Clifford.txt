========================================

[Music] amen do you believe that can you believe that oh glory well saints you can have your seat i see we've got do we have a testimony of sister belinda [Music] amen um that you've offered up and i'm thankful to the lord for answering every single one of them and it's just been so amazing um because my husband's sister passed away last week and i was just and i didn't think of going at all there was just too many things why i shouldn't be going and then i thought um well we pray about it and i put out the prayer requests and i know it was the prayers you know of everyone and also those that came i just want to thank everybody those that came to say you know came along to our house to visit those that gave freely i just want to say thank you everybody and just wanted to give it to sorry i get nervous and all that sorry but just wanted to say it's quite it's not always easy going on to these murals you know and i've been for 15 years now in this country and i went to several marae's over the years and there's quite a protocol to follow and it's a lot of um as i say it's like a lot of spirits you can be dealing with as well so i just wasn't sure if i'm up to it you know so that's why i say thank you for the prayers because it went really really well you know the lord was really good and even the traveling there when we got to taihape we just thought we'll stop for a quick quick stop there at a cafe and i'm glad i'm glad we did because there was a truck accident just in front of us basically so the road was closed and we just had our lunch and then by the time we came out there was a lot of cars blocked up and we're just like oh where can we go so that just look we went a side road and it actually said the road is closed but there was nobody and we just said we'll just keep on driving so we drove all the way up and the road was not closed it was all the way open there was only one car that came came towards us and there was it so we went all the way up there and then we got to where the desert road starts and that was supposed to be closed because of all the snow and it opened three minutes before we got there it was an update saying the road is open so like praise the lord you know so that was amazing and um and then we got there on the day we got there was the day of already where the because it goes over several days those funerals and it was the actual day for the service the coffin was already closed because she decided not to be embalmed so you can only keep it open for so long so when we got there the protocol on this mother was all the females go first so i couldn't actually go together with my husband and so i had to just go with all the other ladies then you have to wait until they call and whether they allow you to come on and all that so the coffin was placed outside and i just walked up there behind these other ladies we were allowed to go so i just thought okay i'll just say hello to the people and greet them and i didn't realize that all the group basically already went to the left-hand side where all the all the visitors were seated and um the other sister-in-law was sitting here it's quite a few people sitting by the coffin right but and she called me up to to come to her so i took my shoes off and went up to say hello and i didn't realize the ceremony already started and then i basically sit right in front there with all the other ones right by the coffin i had a bright green color shirt on which you know usually you're supposed to to wear black and it can be like as i say the traditions can sometimes be that people might be offended if you don't wear the right colors you know so the lord was good i didn't realize that was her favorite color she was wearing that color and i didn't see it because the coffin was already closed but someone told me afterwards that lime green was the color she was wearing in the and i thought well praise the lord you know because other people were like not wearing the right colors and they anyway it was the most peacefulest funeral i have been to in all these years of going to maurice because there's always bound to be someone upset you know and families they fight and they get emotional and there was nothing like that it was such a lot of peace there and that was the lord i believe you know because even others said this was the most peacefulest funeral they have been to so i've been to some of their funerals they fight they physically fight each other you know and they drink and all this but there was nothing like that and i thank the lord for that and then afterwards going to meet some of these in their homes we had a really good time especially one of the nieces she had gone through a lot of hardship and just i had gone through some stuff two years ago and took me a long time to get over it getting out of it and just talking from my heart and she cried and said hey man you're hitting something in my heart and it just released her and um and of course we prayed with them as well and um we just continue to pray she will find the lord because it's not so much about just a spiritual journey somewhere you know to some spirits it's to meet the lord so we pray for that and also the oldest sister we went to yeah just i don't know how to say it it's just when the lord is there um you reach out to them just in the things you say the life you live and i just felt it was the right time to go and yeah just thank you everybody for your prayers and thank the lord for being there at that time god bless you sister belinda for sharing that yes it could be can be hard and cultures and spirits of familiarity and old routines and yeah we come there with a with a with a liberty that we have in christ you know and sometimes maybe you could feel bound you can maybe feel well out of place but i think it's needed that we need to go outside our comfort zone you know go outside and just be light be salt make them salty and then glorify the lord while you're doing that right and with that liberty let's have the winds of faith and set your wings and you can just fly away we'll start with the chorus eh set your wings to the winds of faith [Music] you will fly to a higher place do not struggle it's by grace [Music] set your wings [Music] to the winds of faith you may take [Music] one by side one by faith take the word of god oh what you see [Music] what you believe is what will be that's true saints set your wings to the winds of faith to a higher place do not struggle it's by grace your wings to the winds of faith watch your need make it known to the lord what's your cry oh what's your mountain [Music] much by and by it will i set your wings to the wind [Music] do not struggle it's by grace set your ways to the winds of faith okay eagles come on watch the ego [Music] in the sky he does not struggle [Music] and he does not [Music] is you will fly to a higher place do not struggle [Music] it's by grace [Music] [Music] winds of faith you will fly to a higher place do not struggle [Music] do not struggle [Music] it's by grace said your wings winds [Music] amen lord may we just stay in this atmosphere with jesus welcome holy spirit just move among us lord and as you prepare now our minister's heart lord that's coming now may we just say oh sweet jesus thank you lord that we know that

but while i didn't hear i was having a praying up a storm in there so maybe it's already been spoken but we appreciate brother ben so much amen god bless brother ben and the glory family amen hallelujah well it is a wednesday night so we're not going to keep these entreaties too long we'll go straight to the word so if you could turn with me please to 1 chronicles chapter 28 verse 11 to 14 amen and then you will be able to have your seats amen hallelujah you know tonight thank you musicians really appreciate that you see amen the lord will use them and work through those talents to build the house he will build his house amen hallelujah he'll build you but he's building a bigger house he wants that house to come down on the earth one day it will amen that's your glorified body amen the great house that he's built you the mansion that's waiting for you hallelujah shall come down amen and he will come down and he will build a beautiful house a temple on the earth once again amen hallelujah but you see it's the gifts it's not the people it's not the humans but yet there's gifts in our lives and we are actually stewards we're stewards and it's a very very serious matter very very serious i can't stress it enough that we're stewards and we will be answerable to how we are stewards of the gifts that he's placed in our life because he's got a plan amen and this sermon sermon's called david's burden for us i love david who loves david man i just think about david i think man i can't wait to meet him he's going to be he's just such a nice guy you know but powerful and just just everything just so excitable and so just just you love the lord and you know and every time i read about david i just think my my you know wow hallelujah amen so uh one chronicles chapter 28 verse 11. it says here amen it says then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlors thereof and of the place of the mercy seat now that's key because we've also been given the revelation of the place of the mercy seat we've also had a david god's manifested in the flesh and our generation and actually he's still manifesting in the flesh and that mercy said still being revealed to given the pattern where it all is and all of those things but it's for a purpose let's carry on and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit see by the spirit of the courts of the house of the lord and of all the chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of the god of god and of the treasuries of the dedicated things also for the courses of the priests and levites and for all the work of the service of the house of the lord and for all the vessels of service in the house of the lord amen see it's all being placed it's all there for a purpose it's all been revealed now there's going to be gifts and talents that will cause it all to happen and it will be god and the people and now that's the old testament and now we're in a repeat of what's all happening right now in a far greater measure a far greater measure amen that was just a type but we're in a season where these things is happening again hallelujah a very serious time a very powerful time amen hallelujah now it says here he gave of gold by weight for things of gold for all instruments of all manner of service silver also for all instruments of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service and here in one chronicles 28 verse 19 just jump down to 19 it says here sorry this is a long reading i've kind of abbreviated because yeah there's so much reading tonight so i prayed the lord would just you know that's his word so he can i've prayed he will anoint his word and the quotes and we'll just see the lord move amen and not man but god amen hallelujah hallelujah all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern hallelujah works of this pattern not just some theology but there's a works there's some action there's there's energy he furnishes the energy for the things to take place and says now one chronicles 28 20 it says and david said to solomon his son be strong and of a good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed i don't know what just made fully means but it's not a good thing but just don't be distracted or don't be sad and something might happen to you in your life and it causes you to get upset about something and it can block you from the vision real quickly and easily that you get dismayed off and that's why he says that to joshua he says it to all these people when god says don't be dismayed because things will happen to dismay you we don't want to be dismayed so if you are feeling dismayed tonight the altar in your heart is opened in your pew right now you can get rid of the dismayness right now lay it down right now like just lay it down because this is the time amen god can use you hallelujah he's not finished with you he's not finished with us amen so for the lord god even my god amen i love david's god david's god is my god amen hallelujah will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord amen hallelujah and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship and i love this key here every willingness skillful man let me say that again every willing skillful man hallelujah hey god doesn't want to force nobody yeah man he's looking for willing hearts and and and skillful meaning there's a gift in your life and it's the skill that will build the house of god here amen but he's looking for a willingness for you to say lord here it is i know it's in there somewhere it might be buried under this moment of fear but just lord here i am tonight tonight tonight whether you're a child teenager or a granny or whatever right now this is you can it can happen the second no time you know you can just it's all about your mental attitude tonight and any night for that matter god doesn't deal in time per se he just he's eternal he's powerful for any manner of service also the princes and all the people will be holy not as an h-o-l-y but holy you're reading it obviously holy at the commandment circus completely amen god bless you you may be seated hallelujah there's still more so i'll just read it while you're sitting down hallelujah so one chronicles 29 1. you can turn there or you can just read it on the screen furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation you see david had a burden david had a real burden he was a man of vision he was a man under inspiration he was a man under his it wasn't david per se it was god god had a vision god had a desire amen god was writing prophecy he was writing a type that would bless you tonight and it would bless the bride for all the way through and not just that it's far more than that it's just god he's so powerful he's so glorious how he just does these things and i'm not even going to touch the sides of this subject but we're just going to hit something amen hallelujah but you can go and study it and pray and just enjoy it amen hallelujah i'm so excited about this it's so powerful and glorious amen hallelujah i've been waiting for a long time actually for the lord to inspire this one because this is hap the lord showed me this a long time ago but now is the time amen hallelujah the lord works it all out hallelujah for furthermore david said david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god has chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord amen and this is the vision that we're in we're building the lord's house amen hallelujah god's building the lord's house but he's using us he's looking for a willing heart he's looking for willing hearts tonight hallelujah hmm and the work is great for the it's not for man but for the lord god now i have prepared with all my might i love that i've prepared this is david now he's handing over the reins and the greatest burden of his life was to build the house of the lord and this house that he would build was not just any house this house that he would build would be magnificent and it would be a house that was wonder for all the earth and that all the inhabitants of the earth would wander at this great house hallelujah and that this house would bring god down into a corporal condition the the holy ghost the the presence of god amen would come down and it would inhabit this place and it would change the nation it would change the congregation it would change them and it would cause peace to happen amen now i'm telling you now this i'm not preaching about that coming into you tonight okay that's you it's happened already we're in the age we're in that season the holy ghost is coming to the people he's still waiting for some and once they get it we're going home amen hallelujah but yet and so i'm not saying now i'm it's a holy ghost into you but i'm looking at a higher level of prophecy that i'm talking about the spirit of god coming back to the earth the lord coming back down into the earth but he's looking for a people to build that house for him to prepare now that preparation happens in our life on a personal level but it also happens on a collective level it happens in a local body in a local vision and he's looking for talents to come out of the earth because talents get hidden in the earth very easily very quickly the slightest little tinge of fear or some pride or arrogance or anything amen it happens so quickly and then god can't use you he can't use the talents that he's placed in your life and even if you try and you go and do something it may not be gold silver or bronze it may be wood hay or stubble and we don't want wood hail stubble wood hail stubble is a human effort it's an element that god said it cannot handle the fire but all our works will be tried by fire i'll get ahead of myself so i'll just keep reading now i have prepared with all my might thou shalt love the lord with all thy heart all thy strength all thy mind amen all thy might for the house of my god the gold for the things that be made of gold and the silver for the things of silver and the brass for the things of brass the iron for the things of iron and the wood and wood for the things of wood and on its stones for the stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colors and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance you know living stones coming together stones building up the temple amen to a collective vision that will cause the glory of god to descend upon the earth that will cause it to happen a collective revelation that comes together a people that is ready amen to leave the earth and meet the lord in the air so that he can finally come down and manifest for his glory on the earth hallelujah amen but he's looking for willing people he's looking for people to be honest and be transparent and to realize that this is a service of supernatural manifestation realize that this is a time where right now all the things that's troubling you can be dealt with and things that is holding you down or hiding your talent in the ground can be dealt with tonight amen hallelujah says here moreover because i have set my affection these are key things here i've underlined these but i wish i'd just done a slideshow so i could show you what i emphasized but i'll say it again moreover because i have set my affection where's your affection tonight is it on you or is it on the law is it on your education or is it on jesus amen hallelujah is it on sports or is it on jesus is it on your children or is it on jesus oh my is it on your creature comforts or is it on jesus it's either them or jesus you cannot have both and if anything is displeasing to jesus anything my don't let it get in the way don't let it hold you back don't let it hold you down because there's talents in your life that need to come out of the ground okay because i've set my affection to the house of my god amen now you know it's now you know really if you think about it this this is everything to us this this is everything all that out there is rubbish your education is rubbish rubbish it is a waste of time but you need it because you've got to work and earn money of course i want to be in balance there but it's rubbish it is a waste of your life really but you'll earn money for it and don't get me wrong you need to go do it but this is everything this god doesn't care about that stuff he'll provide for you you don't need to worry about that he made a provision so powerful so supernatural that you never have to worry about that as long as this becomes everything to you this is his vows this is his vision amen our life you know we live so far away these days but back in the old days we could say the church was the center of civilization the center of everybody's affection and all they did that was it now it's everything else almost churches on the back burner you know it's just uh you know life is a nine or five sunday wednesday you know you go and have your taste of god and maybe you pray each night but there's more there's more far far more that god is wanting out of you but he doesn't want you to try and force anything he just wants you to be honest tonight he wants you to be honest and just say lord i know these talents in my life and maybe it's been years and nothing's happened why lord what is in my life that's what's my attitude towards your word or what is it lord does anyone ever ask the lord what is it you say lord is there anything you know the bible says consider your ways we should consider our way every day every morning every night every day live in a state of consideration lord consid i i want to consider my ways tonight lord i i i don't want anything in between nothing between my soul and my savior amen so that he can take over you see you have there is if you could say the tree of life right he says i'm the vineyard the branches so out of the vine comes all the branches and and each each person is like a little branch right you're a branch you're all a branch you're in it you know and and there's only only you fit onto one spot and he's waiting for you to get on the spot we just got to get on the spot because there's sap amen that will make fruit happen in your life he will furnish it all of that now i'll go back to what i said this is everything really let's put it in perspective this is this is what the lord's doing you know all that stuff he says just put me first i'll make all that stuff happen for you you can have your houses whatever you need for you whatever the lord allows and you need in your life i'll give it to you you can have it but for now focus on this focus on the lord where does the lord where do i fit in building this house where's my talon where is it is it hiding in the ground or am i trying to produce it because you there's you can go on the other side of the scale and you can say i'm trying to live a message like i'm trying to produce and i'm trying all these things but it's just not bringing anything or you're just burning out and then you go off and have an episode on the other side but there is a balance in the middle there is a perfect balance amen hallelujah says here because i have set my affections to the house of my god i love i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given to the house of my god over and above i think isaac spoke on that at the meeting you know you can you don't you can't out give god if you're a real man of faith you'll have no trouble giving to the house of god no trouble and actually if you don't you're cursed take it or leave get cursed financially i don't know what else but definitely your pockets will be empty and the holes in the bottom your bed clothes will be too short and your feet will stick out the end because everything you try and do will never be enough until you realize the importance that our god is able to supply every need we don't have to worry about money we don't have to worry about education we don't have to worry about anything if you just put him first he will bless your work he will bless your education he will bless everything according to his perfect will for you you don't have to worry or try and pull it all to yourself that's the unconverted nature of man and we see it in children a lot you know especially a selfish dispos disposed child everything's always to them they're always going to get the biggest step or you know and you see it and that's a human nature not all children is like that in in abundance some is the opposite and you never know everyone's a mixed bag but human nature's like that come on all that i have prepared i i just love that over and above you see david he was a man of faith he was a man of vision he realized that this was the most important thing this was the crescendo of his whole life was that the house be built amen and i'm praying tonight that maybe the lord will use these chopped up words and the burden that he's placed in me to share the words of god and you overlay your own life and say lord i'm considering my ways tonight if there's anything in your life that is that that's not overlaying nicely then just lay on the altar and let him overlay the word on your life so that your life and his life is like a pattern and it just works together and it's do not struggle don't have a struggle about it it's grace grace is here tonight the supernatural power of god but there's promises coming across now promises and brother brandon says the right mental attitude towards any divine promise will bring it to pass hallelujah do you want it to be brought to pass amen hallelujah open the channel of your mental attitude say lord some of these things is for me amen coming off thank you bro and how about i sweat in the winter and the summer man well praise god he says here even oh my amen i have given to the house of my god over and above hallelujah amen now i'm not talking just it's not just about money now it's not just about finances but everything your whole life you know when you really really have something real tremendous happen in your life where god just comes in the holy spirit the purpose of the holy spirit it changes your whole thought process it changes everything that you think about and your whole operating system for those that know about a computer your operating system gets changed tonight you can have a new operating system an operating system that will give you joy unspeakable and follow glory an operating system that will love to see god manifest himself in this place because this is what he's building he's building a body he's building a house amen he's building a house that's ready a man to leave amen and he's calling for talents tonight he's calling for gifts in the body he's calling for children he's calling for every age he's calling for a willing people skillful to let the house be built and he's furnishing the grace amen he's made provision he's cleared the land for you he's wiped out all your enemies he sent a prophet and gave it all that you could shine he made all the provision and he destroyed your enemy your enemies on the ground hey man he's just a liar he might be he's on the ground but he's still lying he's lying on the ground and he's lying to you always that's what he's doing if you believe it then you'll come under that power but i believe that so much truth has been ministered so much truth is coming into your ears because you have a burden and that's why you listen to tapes that's why you listen to the prophet because you realize because the holy ghost inside you tells you that it is that is what's going to clean you and prepare you and and bring you out i'm so glad the lord brought me out amen hallelujah and if you get in a trap or get stuck or some your talent gets hidden in your earth again because it can go back down you can be right up and ride in a place of god and then something happen something goes on and all of a sudden that talent's back in the earth again don't leave it there hey man it's serious and we're gonna read the talent type if we ever get there it's quite far down we may not get there but we'll try we'll see how the lord leads amen because i have set my affection to the house of my god and i just pray if you get anything out of tonight i just pray not out of humanity but just say lord what does that mean if a man in the old testament under the blood of bulls and goats can have such a desire and such a passion for the things of god for the house of god for the for the vision for god's heart is here this is god's heart and when this gets to a place where it's completely pattern on pattern with the lord word upon word amen truth upon truth amen spirit of a spirit together amen then the more coming can go out there because that's part of the talents as well the gifts there's gifts in here that can be out there talents that can be out there singing in the markets whatever it may be out there at the universities hey man we go there only two or three people come come on what's happening where's your affection where is it now i'm not trying to rally you in a humanistic way but consider your ways consider it and say lord now don't when you ask him because many of us probably go lord should i be there should i go i've got all these other things busy got all these other things to do got my own stuff my own hobbies lord should i be there the lord knows your heart you can't ask god like that he's looking for a willing heart hallelujah totally neutral totally neutral and say lord what is my talent where am i at hallelujah because you can go out there amen maybe you need the holy ghost maybe it's time tonight to get the holy ghost maybe there's one little thing in your life that's holding you back and it's just that one little thing and he's been wanting for years to pour his spirit on you hallelujah the lord is here tonight to show you what it is you can he can show you that's what the bible says hallelujah amen you know and we talk about talents i'm just way ahead now but that's all right we talk about talents now and you think okay these gifts in the spirit the prophet says that the gifts should be operating in every local body every local body and there's been seasons where they've been fully operating all the time here now we say lord is there something is there something in my life that's holding back this or am i sitting here with a humanistic attitude or what is it lord and we pray lord jesus here i am you want to be a vessel that he can just come upon any time and prophesy speak or tongues interpret the gift of wisdom the word of knowledge healing it's all there for a blessing it's all there to bless and edify the body but if it will not happen if it's hidden in the earth and it's time tonight to go digging jesus locking the wise man to dig deep hallelujah and build his house upon the rock amen dig deep it's time to dig dig out those talents and present them to the lord and say lord here it is it's covered in dirt right now lord but lord jesus i need this to be cleaned up i need this i know this is what i'm really meant here for this is why i'm on the earth this is my whole purpose amen all the other stuff like i said really it's going to pass away you'll never even remember it it's just the vapor we're only here for a little time hallelujah so let's get our perspective right hey man don't focus on anything else in your affections don't let it become a an obsession it's a means to an end that will be blessed and it will be provided for you as long as you put him first and you see that this is his heart this is what he's doing this is it not that but this will go and get that when there's elected seed out there and people that need to come in and meet jesus who wants people to meet jesus amen who wants people to have what you've got oh my i want g i want people to have this man there's so many broken hearts out there so many ruined lives and you see there's a talent in here that can go and find that ruined life they can go and rescue that ruined life but there's a body that needs to work together it all is it's not just one or this it's everyone it's everyone hallelujah i have of my own proper good gold and silver over and above i've given even three thousand talents of gold and of the gold of affair and seven thousand talents of refined silver amen refined silver i like that to overlay the walls of the house with all the gold of things of gold and the silver of things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artists there's artistifiers in here tonight there's artisticers in here that god wants to get a hold of and he will and you know what all that you're trying right now all your life it may just you know you're not made you might not be made for what you're trying to do right now but when you when you when that talent comes into god's hands when that gift in your life when that gift or whatever it may be that's in you gets in his hands there's no greater joy there's no greater peace there's no greater satisfaction i'm telling you now amen there'll be trials there'll be hardship because the moment that that comes into its position then you get the attacks then the devil tries everything and he's trying everything anyway he'll try everything to keep you from it and then once you get it he'll try everything to keep it in the ground amen but you see as you progress and you have to progress don't delay the inevitable it's going to happen if you're elect if there's an election in you it's going to happen don't delay it get through these things god wants to deal in your life he wants to change you but you need to front up and be a real man or a real woman of god stop being a fearful but be a real man or a real woman of god full of faith the provision is here for you to go beyond warming a seat to go beyond sitting there and doing nothing for the lord and just wondering there's got to be more than wondering you've got to fight for it the kingdom is taken by force you have to take it because the devil will not let you just take it easy but there's a captain hallelujah there's a captain to come down and he speaks a word and there's a people in this room that is in their position functioning with an anointing and that's the captain's voice that will crumble your life that will crumble down those things to help you rahab get out of your old life get out of those old things that are holding you down that's holding your talent on the ground so that you can rise and walk and seize the everlasting prize and come into your position and and live hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah amen david says and who then is willing to conquer consecrate his service this day unto the lord and i ask you this question who then is willing to consecrate his service or her service to the lord are you willing tonight are you willing in your heart you let the lord know you tell him don't just think it either you tell the devil you tell everybody i'm willing i'm willing to do it i want this i'm sick of halfway i'm sick of being tossed to and fro i'm sick of being double minded i just want to be real amen hallelujah just to be real and have the real holy ghost not a religious spirit not a resentful spirit not a troubled spirit not a bruised spirit but the holy spirit he promised it to you hallelujah and you can lay hold of it and there's an anointing in here to crumble the walls holding you down hallelujah oh my hallelujah one corinthians 3 11 to 13 for other foundation can no man lay that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones would hey stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so you see here we have two we have a middle of the road which is a surrendered vessel full of the holy ghost right and god is inspiring and he's using the talent that's in their life and they're connected and then there's a people that are doing it out of pride or out of fear or out of whatever and then there's a people that is unfair and hidden away that's in the ground let's come to the middle tonight come to the middle tonight you know your heart you know where you're at don't be troubled maybe this isn't for you guys maybe it's for someone on that camera but whoever it's full come to the middle come to the middle we're about to go home amen creation's waiting for you creation is waiting for you let's go to heaven why not me why not now why not you why not now i love that line it's so decisive why not what are you waiting for there's nothing else to wait for you gonna wait for the devil no jesus is waiting for you the captain he's there standing there with the sword open in his hand ready for your walls to break so that you can be the real you that you're created to be you're made for it you're made for it so you're saying come to the middle come to where the jew drops a mercy upright amen you know you think oh my help me lord this is we're very very very privileged people do we realize how privileged we are to be sitting here i think about it every time i sit there and i think oh man how did i get here how did this happen is it is it too good to be true that i'm in here in here and then there's people sitting in here that's just a normal thing you know oh yeah i just gotta chew no you don't just go to church you don't just go to church you're in a blessed place you're right where david's heart is king the son of david you're right with jesus heart you're in his vision you're right you are the closest family of jesus christ you're his closest family you are you're his you're you're he's jealous over you and he's gonna move walls and cities and mountains and planets and stars so that you can realize who you are and let the walls crumble down let l come free amen you see rayo had to believe she believed it was faith a man shouldn't do anything else other than she acted upon her face and got anyone in coming and then god acted hallelujah amen you know 2 titus 3 1-5 it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come hello we are here perilous times you're in perilous times and the devil is trying to infiltrate your life on every front everywhere you look he's trying but remember greater is he who is in you and he who is in the world amen but it doesn't mean you're exempt from the attacks exempt from every front hallelujah but let me ask you one thing did david lose hallelujah did the temple get built yes because he trusted in gold the captain that was there for rahab came back for david amen it was that same angel that showed him where to build the temple that revealed all these things to him amen because he was the one that was his heart was in it that's the angel of his presence this is jesus he's here tonight and he's concerned about your redemption he's concerned about your health he's concerned about your mental health he's concerned about your holiness he's concerned about your rapture and condition his concern and he's waiting to act on your behalf he's our advocate amen he dealt with all you certainly dealt with everything he cleared the title and everything oh man so that he can now deal personally in time right now in your life because when we look at these things on a higher level yes on a dispensation no it's all finished and done but what about here and now in your life it can happen it's just a switch in your mind lord i'm sick of fighting this i'm sick of resisting this i'm sick of just sitting in church and not getting anything i want something i want something real tonight who wants something real tonight amen hallelujah you know we don't have to leave the service the same in jesus name i don't even know how the song goes but i like that song amen i won't come here like leave here like i came in jesus name amen for he's ever the same or whatever but amen have that you know expectation is faith you've got to believe it's not just oh i'd expect something to happen but you actually actively believe it's going to happen expectation is i expect i'm believing that god is going to come to my pew today he's going to deal in my life he's going to deal with my children he's going to deal with my family he's going to deal so that i can be positionally placed because i'm sick of this or whatever condition it may be we've all got battles amen has ever got a right punch on you keep it covered keep it covered you know when you're really close to the lord as he loses his effect all of those things that are hounding you when you're close to the lord but you've got to drag that sorry flesh of yours and let it make it do to church but don't just drag it to sit down drag it to worship amen make your flesh praise god make it worship hallelujah go beyond this thing that's not good this thing will hold your hands down and fold it like you're at primary school in a photo shoot that's what it will do that's what the flesh will do but go beyond the camp tonight hey man go beyond it oh man that was somewhere in the notes drag your sorry flesh it doesn't want to do anything good for god but you can make it and when you make it you will be blessed amen hallelujah you know this is my own testimony but i sometimes just praise god i don't feel like it i'm tired or whatever or had a real bad day but i just dragged the sorry flesh and it praises god anyway and i don't leave here like i came amen and it's those little things you start to overcome amen the bible says let not sin rain in your mortal body to obey it in the lust thereof the lust to sit there and wait out the service no go beyond it tonight now make the decision amen hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my hey hallelujah the spirits we fight without natural affection or for men shall be lovers of their own self covetousness boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents children be careful really just give the lord praise tonight children obey your parents for this is a this is a commandment with promise god has promised to give you a long life if you just obey your parents in the lord amen if your parents try to pull you away from the lord well that's a different story you need to put the lord first in those situations and actually to balance this it's actually you and god even as a child now as you and the lord as well you and the lord it's your relationship with god that matters you don't you have your relationship through mommy and daddy you have a relationship directly to him and then it'll be easier to obey your parents it'll be easier the disciplines will go down amen amen and the praises will go up amen your grades will go up school will become easier life will become easier as a child if you put god first samuel was a young boy and one day he had a visitation and the word of god came and stood in his room who wants to any is there any children in here that would like the word of god to come and stand in their room and say noel noel annalise annalise i've got something to tell you god can do it amen hallelujah he loves children amen hallelujah we're not too young we're not too old we're there today is the day amen don't delay what you can have right now because you'll realize how much i should have had it already oh my anyone that gets the holy ghost anyone that really meets jesus realizes my goodness oh my how come i didn't get this sooner why did i delay oh i want it now i want more hallelujah oh it's the greatest thing that can ever happen to a human being because that is what we are here for that's what adam lost he lost that do you think he felt good when he lost that no man has been seeking that for so long and the devil has tried to trade it out for something some corrupted thing but you can have the greatest real thing we want the real thing amen and the holy spirit is the real thing amen the only what is that the only proper thing i ever done amen how does that song go again the only oh my what is that yeah the only thing i ever done was that was right amen because then everything else makes sense oh my you know we're only through the opening scripture amen okay prophet says this and how should i what are you scared about what's you so scared you're afraid seem like that you just can't step right out there and toe the line with the enemy or call anything the devil says a lie let god's word be true see people are scared what are they scared of they're scared of losing this or something else happening there failing to believe that god is supernatural he can work those things out you don't have the reason if you put him first the supernatural can take place i'm telling you now he's never failed me never fail me oh my no matter what's happened no matter what come my way he never failed me hallelujah the lord by grace allowed me to put him first 10 11 years ago and he's never failed me he's always provided he's given me everything that i need of naturally but greater in the spirit oh just humble yourself under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time to where you need to be because you are royal seed of abraham sons and daughters of the king the one that created and he wants to condition you and prepare you to rule and reign with him amen don't you want to have a longer experience under that great leadership don't just fall into it right at the end but come now don't delay get serious it's time today is the day don't be scared don't be fearful of losing stuff don't be fearful of this or that or anything that's just the devil's reasoning oh man toe the line tonight toe the line toe the line you say devil here's the line come eyeball them and deal with them hallelujah this is the line devil we ain't crossing it and i'm not coming on your camp no longer this is where i stand me and my house will serve the lord hallelujah watch what happens oh my all the angels come down and you have a glorious time because you've decided to toe the line with the enemy deal with fear so that your talents can come and shine again and god will give you the desire of your heart when you delight yourself in him amen hallelujah prophet says this you know we want to see the the the anointing of god the supernatural of god in the service in the church so each gift you've got a gift and and those that are in their ministry or or are kind of there's more you see that talent needs to be completely in the hands of god and your affections and that needs to be focused in on what god is wanting to do amen hallelujah so because you see when the talents of uh are focused and with the zeal of his house and with the the passion of christ the same passion that caused them to go to calvary that saw you comes upon the believer comes upon you so that you can function in the body a place a service where god can come down where you see and this is just me but many times i feel like we're only operating at 30 percent you know prayer meetings are 30 whatever that could be higher but it takes conditioning in your own life what are you doing with the talents in your life what are you doing with them when you come to churches your talent shined up and ready or is it still is it covered in muck and maya because you've been you tubing and boob tubing and whatever tubing you don't want to be doing that it's wrong it's wrong don't do it refrain because there's a greater joy for you there's a greater joy for you than soccer there's a greater joy for you than rugby you might have a good time don't get me wrong you might have a great time but there's a greater time right here in your room amen god can come down hallelujah when we go to church amen you might you can be you can having a glorious time a glorious time and it's time i believe it's time it's so time that those of you that are in an office or in a ministry or in a in anything because every part of us there is something for you to do there is a perfect place for you there is a your talent needs to be used and and we want to give it and surrender and say lord everything i am i lay it in your hands everything i take my hands off and say here lord here it is i give it to you completely and i'm going to train around this if my talent is bass guitar i'm going to be bass guitaring i'm going to be praying and i'm going to play it with faith i'm not going to play it to look good i'm not not picking on ketu i'm just that was there and but anything whatever you do if you're song leading and isaac went through it be a good song leader don't just don't just sing songs up the front but find out lord i want you to operate in that so powerful that the glory of god comes down in them in the spirit and the songs that the holy ghost once sung our son it's not just some mechanical and i'm kind of i should really repent because i told jeremy just to find a list but it was you know it was a bit of a last minute so you know sorry lord we're all human right but sometimes we just have to do things but if you really think about it right there it's got to be more there is more and the talent that you have can operate in a higher capacity so much that when people come every talent can be under a prophetic anointing so that god can operate through you and speak the mysteries and the living miracles of god and testify and sing a song that's exactly what that person needed to get the holy ghost all in a channel of inspiration because this is a supernatural church we serve a supernatural god and we're going to a supernatural heaven so why don't you relish in your inheritance now take hold of it take hold fight for it amen drag your sorry flesh into it hallelujah amen drag it into it you may be tired but don't go beyond that hallelujah go beyond it amen hallelujah hallelujah we're just going to close in a minute very soon hallelujah he says here in a prisoner i think this was read out and some minister preached this but it really really moved me and i found it again in in the research and the study says god is looking for prisoners he's always done it throughout time and memorial hallelujah and you i don't want to go too far on one angle but he'll he'll drag you somewhere or another you'll get there why not just submit why not just surrender to the greatest person of your life the one that loves you more than you love yourself or love anything else that anyone could ever love you he loves you he's a real daddy and he's a real bridegroom he's a real everything oh my he's the greatest he's so good he wants a prisoner he wants somebody now here he says he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to christ has has to be a prisoner to christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but christ as a prisoner even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with christ and him only then god can use you until then you can't now that doesn't mean that you don't have relationships actually your relationships get better way better you can handle life a lot better you become a stable engine that never missed fires amen hallelujah because you've got the right fuel amen the spark plugs are going amen hallelujah it's got the turbos going and everything hey man supercharged hallelujah nitrous everything is all in there to perform amen 70 times 7 horsepower whatever you know real good stuff so much amen buddy what is what he's saying there is you don't want to be led by a human opinion by a human family trait or some ideology or some political view or anything nothing you don't want to be swayed by anything because it's all can lead you the wrong way and it may even lead you a good way if it's a christian leader or whatever but he doesn't want you to be connected in that way to them he needs you to say lord 100 neutral 100 surrendered and say lord here's my talent lord what do you want to do with me here i am i'm i'm at the end of my own self i die to myself i just want you to live because i've tried and i've failed you know those of you that has the holy ghost you know you come to the end of yourself and you tried and you tried and you went up and down in and out everything and then one day one glorious day amen oh my one glorious day and then it began your journey hallelujah and a little by little you get the land and you come into a glorious place so that your focus and your connections can change so that all of the stuff out here don't you see the reason he made that provision in matthew 6 it's also that you can realize this is everything this this is his heart god's heart is this is it you're as close as family he may have uh foolish virgins and whatever second resurrection people sheep coming up at the judgment but you are his closest family and he's really jealous over here and he wants to see your talent shining amen amen hallelujah let's just finish if the musicians could come you know our action affects those who are without us are not yet complete it says in hebrews 11 there's a whole array of saints of every age that are waiting for us and your talent when it's in the hands of god will play a part in finishing the house of god finishing the work of god and so i'm encouraging you today encouraging you out of haggai verses 1 uh sorry haggai chapter 1 verses 7 to 8 he says here thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it amen and i will be glorified saith the lord you see he is looking for a house he is looking for theophanies to come down he's looking for that great house mansion to come down upon each one of us one day so he can build his house amen all those stones coming together holy priesthood seed what are they living stones coming together to form a house where is your affection where is your focus because there's talents in your life that must come out of the ground for the talent that was hidden in the ground the man was condemned and went out of the presence of god so you see there is dire consequences and sorry to finish on such a negative tone but you got to be lit there is dire consequences even in the right intention yes he just thought i've got to preserve this he preserved it by fears he was scared he was fearful of losing something or gaining us or or losing that or maybe maybe as a child you're scared of what the others in the church will think about you right here right now hello maybe you're scared all the others are gonna think i'm a wuss or a because i hold my hands up in church and i and i've got the holy ghost you get the holy ghost children and you watch the others they'll love the experience yes they'll love what you've got so don't let their opinions lead you never never look at other people and behave because of what they think but look unto the lord and seek ye the lord with all your heart and get the holy ghost tonight hallelujah don't worry about what you've got out there or what's going to happen or if you're tired or not hired just get the holy ghost tonight get the holy ghost right now ladle down give your life to the lord and don't give up amen even as a young child don't be led but consider your ways only be led by the holy ghost amen listen to mummy and daddy just be led by the holy ghost because it's between us and jesus and you know there's peer pressure this one thinks that and this one i got children i hear all about it oh this one doesn't like me or this one doesn't that and this and all my and i just say just get the holy ghost just give your life to the lord only folk just focus on what he has for you and get so filled with him that the atmosphere around you will attract your real friends and that's like that for all of us don't you want a divine atmosphere in your life that's real attractive to me not some pretty eyes or pretty body or whatever but the holy ghost that's true attraction that's what will attract your real wife husband friends whatever because you put god first the holy ghost will attract the real one for you and your real friends will come and your joy will be full who wants fullness of joy tonight stand with me please amen what do we have as we gather amen let's sing that song but just pray it to the lord amen we gather may your spirit work within it has began to make me we will be blessed because we will be [Music] [Laughter] his mercies [Music] every morning [Music] the mercy of god is here tonight and you have an opportunity tonight [Music] don't worry about anything outside of this but just think about the words that's been spoken tonight and let your focus change but let him come and change it tonight the spirit of the living god is able he he's no man's deader and he can help you tonight out of your situation if you really really really want to he knows the heart of your heart oh boy he knows the fight in your flesh right now he knows the reasonings that's going on and i'm just encouraging you tonight cast down reasoning don't reason nothing right now don't reason all of those things out or this or that but you know if your talent is hidden in the ground tonight and i'm encouraging you let god bring it out tonight whatever is hiding it whether you're filled with the holy ghost or not if there's a talent in there it can come a little higher tonight amen make proficient for the lord make provision for the talent he's calling you to there's practical things that you can do you can give your time and devote your time to truly possess the land and possess what that talent and surround it the practicalities that tell us the skills the knowledge that would surround that talent to make it shine given time don't just stumble into your position half-hearted but give your whole heart hallelujah this is the time the enemy has pulled out all the stops he's giving his best shot at destroying you and killing the vision and holding down because when you and your talent comes into his position he brought out and completely my circumstance you see as this body comes together and functions at a hundred percent capacity when god comes down and prophesies in the supernatural takes place all the time and it becomes a reality hallelujah in every life every home every family altar when it happens the devil has nowhere to room he got no elbow room you've got all the elbow room amen as you rise up he comes down as you come to your position he loses everything as we go in the rap2 he comes and bound by circumstance a thousand years and watch the golden age take place there watch what happens when the house is built together and when we come together and function in full capacity oh lord jesus father we just come humbly before you lord i've delivered the message lord i pray father you would take these words and anchor them and just stir it up father i believe lord that you caused david to address all the princes and kings and all the leaders of israel and and lord there was a burden on david's heart and and the spirit of god caused the burden to come upon others and come upon the congregation and come upon the shoes of stone and come upon the singers and the priesthood and all of the talents that would cause your house to be built and tonight lord jesus i pray lord on a greater measure that the holy ghost will come upon the talents in the church and come upon the gifts in the body and come upon every calling in every office and it would function like it was in the book of acts and perfect love would come and operate every gift oh jesus father i pray lord that you would vindicate these things the lord this is not man but this is you and i believe lord jesus that you ordered this you wanted this and i pray lord that you would deliver it beyond my words beyond what i say but you would confirm it in the gifts confirm it in the congregation oh jesus father let the fruits the word father be born in our hearts and lord may you stir every office in every gift to function in its full capacity for lord if our life doesn't reflect the books of it there's serious things wrong and lord it's time that we got to dealing with it it's time that we got serious and said lord why is my life not like a book of acts why have i just got a nine to five sunday wednesday i want more i want to have a fullness of cold while we're going into

and if you want to continue these things one day lord at your will your least desire is our greatest command we love you committed to you and humble ourselves under your mighty hand in jesus christ's name [Music] amen [Music] new every morning new every morning great as thy faithfulness oh lord great is thy faith [Music] great is thy faithfulness [Music] that you love me i'm amazed how you care
