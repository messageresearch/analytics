[49:49] Hallelujah I'm not fighting against you
[49:51] you're not fighting against me we're
[49:53] fighting against one
[49:55] enemy and that is the devil Lucifer the

[50:03] don't believe that the devil or or
[50:06] different things are real well let me

[50:30] Spirits God and
[50:32] Satan and either you're surrendering
[50:35] your body to him which is God or you're

[50:40] enemy and tonight if you're like this
[50:42] your like this see right now amen the
[50:45] atmosphere can go up and down because
[50:47] there are two kinds of spirits
[50:50] present a spirit of Faith which loves
[50:53] God or a spirit of unbelief that doubts
[50:56] God God Amen but I want to say tonight
[50:59] greater is he that is in me than he that
[51:03] is in the
[51:05] world my God is
[51:11] real Hallelujah y'all got to get ready
[51:13] for that

[51:18] think about joining an army or being in
[51:20] an
[51:20] army and you get you an examination the
[51:24] first thing they do when they examine
[51:26] you
[51:27] they examine your
[51:30] mind the prophet of God said the
[51:32] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[51:36] mind and if you are not stable up here
[51:40] you're not stable in
[51:42] Christ catch it stable in Christ because
[51:47] real learning means nothing if God is
[51:49] not the absolute that's why the Bible
[51:52] says let this mind be in you which was
[51:55] also in who Christ I want my thinking to
[51:58] be God's thinking I want my thoughts to
[52:01] be God's thoughts Hallelujah I want my
[52:03] actions to be God's actions what's going
[52:06] on in your
[52:08] [Applause]
[52:12] mind
[52:14] Hallelujah and some of you are very
[52:16] confused in your
[52:18] mind one being you feel like a soldier
[52:22] and you marching and the next minute
[52:24] somebody talk about you and then you
[52:27] start having
[52:30] issues you start one of the greatest
[52:32] things the devil use amongst young
[52:34] people is mind
[52:38] battles I'm not good enough I'm not tall
[52:41] enough I'm not light enough I'm not dark
[52:44] enough just all kind of stuff playing
[52:47] with your
[52:50] mind you ever thought somebody you heard
[52:54] that somebody said something about you
[52:56] you heard that somebody said something
[52:59] about you and then you get to get with
[53:01] that person and talk to them about what
[53:03] you heard and they say no I ain't never
[53:06] said
[53:07] that oh that ain't never happened to
[53:09] y'all what happened to
[53:12] me or should I say you didn't hear it
[53:16] the way he they meant it there we go we
[53:19] got you now H you heard it different
[53:22] than how it was said and we do that all
[53:25] the time somebody can say well brother
[53:27] DS is loud and I hear that part loud and
[53:30] they walking out the door and they say
[53:31] but I love it and all I heard was them
[53:35] saying brother DS is
[53:37] loud and now I got an
[53:40] issue and the devil has created an Open
[53:43] Door well I got a complex because I
[53:45] didn't hear the whole
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:51] story and young people get complexes
[53:55] because you don't allow God to give you
[53:57] the whole
[53:59] story all you hear is what the devil is
[54:01] saying the devil said this the devil
[54:03] said that do what I do you know what I
[54:05] do when he's talking I say shut up
[54:08] devil don't receive his
[54:11] thoughts don't receive his mind
[54:15] Hallelujah because that's a Battleground
[54:18] you say brother what are you talking
[54:19] about because you see the mind is a
[54:21] Battleground because you can have your
[54:23] mind made up to do something and have
[54:25] one obstacle and say no I'm not going to
[54:27] do
[54:28] it Hallelujah that's why I say it's a
[54:31] Battleground or it could be something
[54:33] tough and you say no I ain't do it but
[54:35] you think about it we going we going to
[54:36] battle Hallelujah we going to battle you
[54:39] got to have the right mindset H you
[54:42] can't you can't not in my not in my Army
[54:45] you can't be one of them people fighting
[54:47] one day and then you like ah I'm
[54:49] scared no every day we going to battle
[54:54] every day we going to possess land
[54:57] every day we going to kick the devil out
[54:59] until we conquer the whole
[55:04] land hallelujah amen you know sometimes
[55:07] I be at my church Hallelujah you know I
[55:10] got a pastor and you know sometimes I
[55:13] see things that I don't like and you
[55:16] know I I look at it and I be thinking
[55:20] why is he letting them do that what's
[55:22] wrong with the pastor that's what's
[55:25] going on in my mind
[55:26] like he letting them do this he letting
[55:28] them do that I
[55:30] just I want a piece of it
[55:33] bad you know but then God had to deal
[55:35] with me and like brother Steve talked
[55:37] about the pastor evangelist but mine is
[55:39] a little bit more simple Hallelujah you
[55:42] know the difference between a pastor and
[55:44] evangelist they all they both have a big
[55:46] gun H not a 22 not a pop but a
[55:55] AK-47
[55:57] automatic Hallelujah you don't have to
[56:00] reload to the clip
[56:02] empty
[56:03] amen AK-47 H and they see as a pastor
[56:08] the same thing I see as an evangelist is
[56:11] just two different
[56:12] gifts but the thing of it is hallelujah
[56:16] he's looking at what I'm looking at but
[56:18] there's one difference his gun has a
[56:21] safety mine
[56:22] doesn't
[56:25] Hallelujah
[56:32] I was born to shoot and shoot and shoot
[56:35] and shoot and shot and shot and shot and
[56:37] shot and shot and shot and shot and
[56:40] blast and blast shot and shoot blast and
[56:43] blast shoot and
[56:46] shoot
[56:50] hallelujah
[56:53] hallelujah I was born to attack amen
[56:57] that's my makeup my makeup is to
[57:01] attack tell the devil I'm coming after
[57:04] you I'm Bor to attack
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:21] hallu
[57:25] w
[57:28] God has people in his camp that are not
[57:32] afraid of the
[57:33] adversary that are not afraid to get in
[57:36] the trenches Hallelujah and say devil we
[57:39] know where you're coming from and I'm
[57:41] going be here waiting on
[57:44] you
[57:46] hallelujah
[57:49] hallelujah and we going to deal with the
[57:52] issues that you've caused in this war
[57:57] Hallelujah am I boasting no I just know
[58:00] my
[58:02] purpose and I'm comforable with that
[58:06] Hallelujah but you know the first thing
[58:08] they do they examine your mind make sure
[58:10] you are
[58:13] sane now when you get in there they make
[58:16] you
[58:18] crazy but they want to make sure that
[58:20] when you're doing that examination that
[58:23] your mind is in the right
[58:25] place they examining somebody and they
[58:27] talking to them and they sit there doing
[58:32] like you think they going to enlist that
[58:34] person in the Army no because their mind
[58:37] is someplace else hallelujah how is God
[58:40] ever going to use you when your mind is
[58:42] in the
[58:45] world hallelujah how is God ever going
[58:48] to strengthen you when your mind is
[58:50] someplace else Hall the Bible says amen
[58:53] think on these things and it says bring
[58:56] every other Hallelujah bring those
[58:58] thoughts into captivity Hallelujah bring
[59:00] it under subjection cast down
[59:04] imagination
[59:07] Hallelujah and you know after they deal
[59:09] with your mind amen if you pass that
[59:11] test and they say okay you know how they
[59:13] make sure your mind together they hold
[59:15] up pictures they say tell me what you
[59:20] see simple pictures that everybody knows
[59:24] about if they P up a cat and you say a
[59:31] bear they they they'll say let's do this
[59:34] again pull out another picture and this
[59:37] time they hold up a bear and you say a
[59:44] cat you say he's crazy and you know what
[59:48] they're saying we can't trust him with
[59:51] this kind of
[59:54] power we cannot put the the weapons of
[59:56] warfare in his hands because he won't be
[1:00:00] able to handle that power because the
[1:00:02] prophet of God said power without
[1:00:04] character it's satanic and there are so
[1:00:07] many people that want the power but
[1:00:09] don't have the character they want to be
[1:00:12] pastors they want to be preachers they
[1:00:13] want to be this they want to be that but
[1:00:15] does not have the spiritual
[1:00:18] character God never give you a church if
[1:00:21] you don't have the
[1:00:24] character
[1:00:27] wo we wonder why we don't see the the
[1:00:31] the gifts of the Spirit moving in our
[1:00:33] church because people do not have the
[1:00:35] spiritual character for God to show them
[1:00:38] things about somebody else's life and
[1:00:40] for them not to do something
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:45] crazy you think God going to show you a
[1:00:48] dream or somebody or vision of
[1:00:50] somebody's life and you ain't got the
[1:00:51] character to pray
[1:00:53] for oh man God show me he committed
[1:00:59] adultery and you tell everybody else in
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:02] church God can't trust you with that
[1:01:06] power H amen how is God ever going to
[1:01:10] use you young people hallelujah if he
[1:01:13] can't trust
[1:01:15] you
[1:01:17] H oh my I feel so much so much of a poor
[1:01:21] wonderful my thoughts are going
[1:01:24] everywhere but let's let's just deal
[1:01:26] with this
[1:01:27] Army you know if you pass the Mind test
[1:01:30] they say okay oh he list and the next
[1:01:33] thing they do I'm going down then they
[1:01:36] check your
[1:01:38] eyes you want to make sure you got the
[1:01:40] right sight you want to make sure you
[1:01:42] looking at the right thing Hallelujah
[1:01:44] and if Hallelujah if you can't see what
[1:01:47] God see God can't use you Hallelujah you
[1:01:50] have to be able to tap into Hallelujah
[1:01:52] the vision of Christ young people
[1:01:54] hallelujah if your eyes are on Facebook
[1:01:57] all the time your eyes are on Instagram
[1:02:00] your eyes are on this movie that movie
[1:02:02] and this movie star that movie star your
[1:02:05] eyes are all in the wrong place you know
[1:02:07] what's going on the Bible says that the
[1:02:09] light of the body is the
[1:02:14] eye so if your eyes are in the wrong
[1:02:17] place you'll lose the battle if you're
[1:02:20] looking at the wrong thing you'll lose
[1:02:21] the battle why because spirits come in
[1:02:24] your body to your
[1:02:27] eyes evil spirits come through your body
[1:02:30] by what you looking at why do you think
[1:02:33] people have
[1:02:34] nightmares because of something they
[1:02:38] watched Hallelujah one time I was in a
[1:02:42] church and I was preaching about having
[1:02:45] rest and I say it's a shame you supposed
[1:02:48] to be Christians and you can't even get
[1:02:50] a good night's sleep cuz the devil
[1:02:52] tormenting you in your own
[1:02:54] bed I said because you sitting at
[1:02:57] watching some old horror picture you're
[1:03:00] watching somebody kill somebody or shoot
[1:03:02] somebody and all kind of stuff let me

[1:33:56] power over you cuz you can never go on
[1:33:59] and if it was a man you can never look
[1:34:01] at a man and expect him to love you

[1:34:32] brought it to God and God dealt with it
[1:34:35] God took away that pain God took away
[1:34:37] that hurt and they no longer live in
[1:34:40] that world because they allowed God to
[1:34:43] deal with that issue and close that
[1:34:47] door and now they're in the army
[1:34:52] fighting Lord close those
[1:34:56] doors sometimes things like that happen
[1:34:59] when you get hurt no it's not your
[1:35:01] fault it was a demon that did that to
[1:35:06] you
[1:35:08] amen hallelujah let go of that hurt let
[1:35:13] go of that pain it's in here let it
[1:35:16] go thank you Lord Let It
[1:35:18] Go hallelujah it's not your fault am Let
[1:35:23] It Go
[1:35:24] and that's what happens people will run
[1:35:26] from God because of their
[1:35:28] fears they've been hurt they got issues
[1:35:30] they got pains so they they they'll run
[1:35:33] from God and they'll say well Lord you
[1:35:35] don't love me and Lord You're not real
[1:35:37] and all these things because of the
[1:35:38] things that happened in that life right
[1:35:41] what you have to do is deal with that
[1:35:43] issue and close that
[1:35:45] door sir cuz as long as that door is
[1:35:48] open Satan will keep walking back in
[1:35:50] right amen he'll keep stirring up that
[1:35:52] hurt H and I know we got
[1:35:55] a diversity of people but you know in
[1:35:58] the US amen y'all understand what
[1:36:02] slavery was all about you know I know a
[1:36:05] lot of Africans are here South Africans
[1:36:07] you understand what slavery was all
[1:36:08] about but this is the thing amen if you
[1:36:11] never been a part of it you can't
[1:36:14] understand
[1:36:15] it so you can't take my feelings for
[1:36:18] granted what you have to do is try to
[1:36:21] understand me if you never lived in my
[1:36:24] world you don't know what I'm
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] battling so you can't come and tell me

[1:36:49] didn't teach them about black history
[1:36:53] like I didn't teach them about slavery
[1:36:55] and all that stuff because bringing up
[1:36:57] that past would only bring up those
[1:37:02] spirits and teaching them about the
[1:37:04] march at Montgomery and all the stuff
[1:37:06] and then they'll start looking at you
[1:37:08] funny and looking at other people funny
[1:37:11] that never did anything to them because

[1:37:16] hurts and now my child's living through
[1:37:19] my
[1:37:22] pain and they Wen even a part of it but

[1:39:18] powers close those
[1:39:22] doors don't let the devil tell you you
[1:39:25] was born that way yeah you was born what
[1:39:27] you are and you look at it in the
[1:39:32] mirror you know I like to say it like
[1:39:34] this it's so just forgive me for being
[1:39:36] frank but it's so
[1:39:38] stupid they're fighting over bathroom
[1:39:41] laws in the states bathroom laws the
[1:39:44] right to go in this bathroom because
[1:39:46] they a guy woke up one morning like Oh I
[1:39:48] Feel Like a
[1:39:52] Woman
[1:39:55] I I want the right to use the women's
[1:40:00] bathroom and a woman wake up one morning
[1:40:03] oo my voice kind of my voice kind of
[1:40:08] deep I think I'm a
[1:40:14] man the power of
[1:40:16] perversion Satan's messing with their
[1:40:19] mind and he can't use your mind when
[1:40:22] it's perverted and you're trying to get
[1:40:24] in the army but let's look at it let's
[1:40:26] look at the real substance of it because
[1:40:28] they'll say you I like the show y'all
[1:40:30] know I'm an actor not a
[1:40:35] Pharisee y'all know I dramatize things
[1:40:37] but let's look at it let's look at what
[1:40:39] they really want you know you take a man
[1:40:42] who wakes up one morning and he has this
[1:40:44] battle in his mind oh I'm a woman and
[1:40:47] he's 6'
[1:40:52] n
[1:40:56] 6 with
[1:40:59] nine with a size 21
[1:41:03] [Laughter]
[1:41:06] ft it could be but I ain't met a woman
[1:41:10] yet with a size 21
[1:41:12] foot I'm just
[1:41:15] saying I'm just saying it could exist
[1:41:17] but I'm just saying I I ain't I ain't
[1:41:20] never hard you know 6'9 21
[1:41:23] foot I I feel like I feel like I'm a
[1:41:26] woman I want to go in the women's
[1:41:28] bathroom so he fight for those right or
[1:41:31] she or he whatever it is fight for those
[1:41:34] rights fight for those rights because
[1:41:36] the world is telling them that liberal
[1:41:38] you can be whatever you want to be so
[1:41:41] he's fighting to be what he thinks he
[1:41:43] wants to be he's still 6'
[1:41:47] n he still got a 21 siiz foot he can't
[1:41:52] change that
[1:41:54] he can't make his foot he can't go
[1:41:56] through a foot
[1:41:57] transplant and get smaller
[1:42:00] feet he can't go to some doctor and tell
[1:42:03] a doctor cut him in half make him
[1:42:07] petite he can't do
[1:42:10] that it's an issue it's a
[1:42:16] perversion so for the for the for the
[1:42:19] sake of of just making a point let's
[1:42:21] just say he wins he
[1:42:24] wears I can go I can go in the women's
[1:42:27] bathroom and he he he he struts his
[1:42:29] stuff in there he 6' n so his hand is
[1:42:32] probably way up
[1:42:36] here so he walks in he gets in the
[1:42:39] bathroom you know and he feel like he's
[1:42:42] liberated he's won the battle you know I
[1:42:44] got rights the same rights as a woman
[1:42:46] I'm a woman in a man's body and then he
[1:42:49] goes to the stall and uses it like a man
[1:42:56] he fought to be a woman but when he got
[1:42:59] there to do the actual act he still was
[1:43:02] a man that's
[1:43:06] right so what did he really
[1:43:09] accomplish
[1:43:13] nothing
[1:43:17] stupid same thing with the women what's
[1:43:20] up man what's
[1:43:21] up what's up

[1:43:41] man I'm going to men's bathroom and she
[1:43:43] feel like she won look in the mirror
[1:43:45] yeah I won and uses the bathroom like a
[1:43:49] woman so what did she
[1:43:51] accomplish nothing
[1:43:53] right nothing it's just issues and open
[1:43:57] doors right close those
[1:44:00] doors let me tell you something young

[1:53:29] there she cut all her hair down but God
[1:53:32] start dealing with her God start
[1:53:33] restoring her and now her hair was
[1:53:35] growing and she remember the principles
[1:53:37] of keeping her hair alone and uh she was
[1:53:40] sitting in the chair where she normally
[1:53:41] go to Beautician and and and and and and
[1:53:44] and and she told The Beautician don't
[1:53:45] cut my hair she said it real nice don't
[1:53:48] cut my hair and The Beautician says I
[1:53:50] can do it in a way where nobody you know
[1:53:54] she said that lady never said anything
[1:53:56] like that
[1:53:58] before it was a
[1:54:00] demon trying to keep that door
[1:54:04] open and she says she knew the way she
[1:54:08] said it it wasn't strong enough so she
[1:54:11] she didn't know if the lady really
[1:54:13] understood or not but she said when she
[1:54:15] was sitting in the chair such conviction
[1:54:17] came over her she knew God was standing
[1:54:21] there and then the Lord said said if you
[1:54:23] cut it if you cut it you do not get to
[1:54:26] choose your
[1:54:30] judgment see that's what we don't
[1:54:32] realize about playing with
