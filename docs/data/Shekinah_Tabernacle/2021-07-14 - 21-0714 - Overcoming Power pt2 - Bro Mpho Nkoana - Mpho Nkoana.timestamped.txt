[27:06] man i felt so guilty when i passed you
[27:09] and you passed me again you were talking
[27:11] to me but i was on the phone
[27:14] so i thought this this sister looks
[27:17] familiar
[27:19] so we came from the same bus i think
[27:22] so the lord bless you amen so
[27:26] if it was possible i was going to be
[27:30] commending on each and every one of you
[27:32] individually
[27:33] you know just to show you that you are
[27:35] so special before the lord amen i was
[27:38] going to start from brother isaac
[27:39] and and say welcome and each one of you
[27:42] but we haven't got much time to do that
[27:45] so we need to redeem the time while we
[27:47] have the little bit we have amen
[27:50] how many how many are happy to be in the
[27:52] service tonight
[27:53] let's just put everything aside anything
[27:56] that can come in your mind in your eyes
[27:58] in your memory anything
[28:00] put it aside just for now just pause it
[28:05] let's focus on the lord amen i'm happy
[28:07] to be here
[28:08] it's a wonderful privilege brother isaac
[28:10] thank you so much for the songs tonight
[28:12] may god bless you i think you can take
[28:14] the comfort of your seats
[28:16] you and the crew god bless you richly
[28:18] for
[28:19] bringing us in thank you boys god bless
[28:22] you
[28:23] and now you're leaving me here alone and
[28:26] exposed
[28:28] but i believe you're leaving me with the
[28:30] lord jesus amen
[28:31] i believe as the word of god says where
[28:34] two or three i get that in my name
[28:38] i will be in your midst amen and that is
[28:40] a promise of the word of god
[28:42] uh the lord is so happy to have you here
[28:46] this evening
[28:47] so that he can fulfill his weight
[28:50] and then uh oh yes yes before i go far
[28:53] happy birthday to our dear friend
[28:55] brother jonathan
[28:58] you can see tonight he's even wearing a
[29:00] tie
[29:02] amen happy birthday my boy god bless you
[29:05] and uh i would like to
[29:08] just make just just set up the time if
[29:10] you don't mind last time
[29:13] i preached very long
[29:16] and and and i felt wrong i felt
[29:20] condemned afterwards because
[29:22] though you know at home when we eat
[29:27] every home the mother dishes the food
[29:29] and some bring big plates some bring
[29:30] small plates
[29:32] so the one who brought the big plate get
[29:35] a lot and the one who bring a small
[29:38] plate also go
[29:39] get according to the plate
[29:42] so but sometimes the mother just feel a
[29:44] bit you know that i don't want to give
[29:46] him too much
[29:48] so some once more someone's a little bit
[29:51] someone's but
[29:52] we must just try to accommodate everyone
[29:55] but there's one person that we have to
[29:56] accommodate this evening
[29:58] and that is the lord jesus christ
[30:00] because he he
[30:01] opened everything and accommodated us
[30:04] so i believe tonight you have not come
[30:06] to see me
[30:08] and you have not come to to see one
[30:11] another
[30:12] we have come to meet the lord jesus
[30:15] christ because if you have come to see
[30:16] me
[30:18] i'm afraid you're going to go back home
[30:19] disappointed
[30:21] because for me i've got nothing to give
[30:24] you
[30:24] nothing absolutely zero
[30:28] only the lord jesus he's the one who can
[30:31] give you something here tonight
[30:33] even if we just speak for five minutes
[30:36] the lord jesus christ can give you just
[30:37] one way that is so powerful
[30:40] to turn your life around that is so
[30:42] powerful
[30:43] to give you a a long lasting testimony
[30:47] he is able to do that so before
[30:50] we go any far any further let me just
[30:54] get this brother ben i watch
[30:58] just to to guide me amen i've already
[31:01] greeted you
[31:02] let's read the bible and then we can can
[31:04] sit down
[31:06] so um yeah um
[31:10] i would like us to i wonder how many how
[31:12] many
[31:13] can tell me what are we talking about
[31:15] today what is our title today how many
[31:18] knows
[31:20] nobody knows
[31:21] [Laughter]
[31:23] my girls in the front what did i say
[31:27] last time
[31:29] that we were talking about overcoming
[31:33] power
[31:33] part one remember
[31:37] how many remembers okay i forgive you
[31:41] but at any rate last time we spoke about
[31:44] the overcoming power
[31:46] and we said not by might not by power
[31:48] but my spirit says the lord you recall
[31:50] now
[31:51] does it click so that's what we spoke
[31:53] about
[31:54] and then today we are speaking about the
[31:56] overcoming power part two
[31:59] we want to focus on what really it takes
[32:01] what does it take
[32:02] to get that overcoming power what does
[32:06] it take
[32:07] let's read john 1st john chapter 5.
[32:12] first john chapter five and
[32:16] oh yeah thank you
[32:19] what
[32:22] yes now i'm in control now thank you
[32:25] first john chapter five and we'll read
[32:27] the verse
[32:29] 4 and verse 5. if you are there just say
[32:32] amen
[32:35] now the bible says for whosoever is born
[32:38] of god
[32:38] overcometh the world and this is the
[32:41] victory
[32:42] that overcometh the way the world even
[32:45] our faith
[32:47] who is he that overcometh the world
[32:51] but he that believeth that jesus is the
[32:54] son
[32:54] of god let's just pray heavenly father
[32:58] once again dear lord um
[33:02] we feel insignificant we feel unworthy
[33:06] to read this word lord but we know
[33:09] master that
[33:10] you are the only one who can even
[33:12] interpret it into our hearts
[33:14] you are the only one lord who can speak
[33:17] the spirit of the way of the lord in
[33:20] this word that we have read
[33:22] anyone can open the bible and read
[33:25] but master it takes your inspiration it
[33:27] takes your anointing father
[33:29] lord it does not even take what i can do
[33:32] or read or anything it takes you lord
[33:34] jesus
[33:36] to come tonight and anoint your weight
[33:39] to the hearts of your children
[33:41] so we prayed here father that you come
[33:42] at this moment even according to your
[33:44] promise
[33:46] because lord you said you will be with
[33:48] us you said where two or three i
[33:50] gathered in my name
[33:52] and here's your people lord we are
[33:53] gathered under no other name
[33:56] but the name of our lord jesus christ
[33:59] and lord we have believed in your weight
[34:01] and we know that your weight will never
[34:03] go out and come back to you
[34:05] empty and i pray dear lord that you
[34:07] bless it
[34:08] to the lives of your children to their
[34:11] hearts
[34:12] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[34:13] master we also pray
[34:15] we don't want to forget lord to say
[34:16] father forgive us
[34:18] forgive our wrongs lord our mistakes our
[34:21] trespasses
[34:22] understanding that we are still wearing
[34:24] this flesh
[34:25] that is so weak that is so susceptible
[34:29] to so many errors and mistakes that is
[34:31] so weak
[34:33] and we pray dear lord that you forgive
[34:34] us where we have wronged you where we
[34:37] have
[34:37] where we have mistaken you lord where we
[34:40] have let you down and disappointed you
[34:42] so that father we can be free and ready
[34:45] to eat from your table tonight
[34:47] lord even as we forgive anyone who has
[34:49] wronged us
[34:50] we forgive them unconditionally father
[34:53] that's the attitude you gave us
[34:55] in the lord's prayer we ask that you
[34:57] help us tonight
[34:58] as we commit the saviors and your
[34:59] children in the name of our lord jesus
[35:01] christ we pray
[35:02] and the church all say amen you can
[35:06] enjoy the comfort of your seats
[35:08] and as i've said that we we're going to
[35:11] speak about
[35:13] that title overcoming power and
[35:16] you know the prophet teaches us that
[35:19] when we come with the right attitude
[35:20] before god
[35:22] when we come with a and you know the
[35:24] right attitude is a positive one
[35:26] are we together today i'm not going to
[35:28] be jumping around i'm hoping there will
[35:30] be no muscle pulls
[35:32] there will be no cramps today hallelujah
[35:35] how many confess is that today there
[35:37] will be no claims of the devil
[35:41] and he teaches us that
[35:44] you know when you come i'm hearing some
[35:47] echo but
[35:48] i'm hearing myself speaking after myself
[35:53] he says when we come with the right
[35:54] mental attitude you know we can get
[35:56] every promise of god fulfilled in our
[35:59] lives
[36:00] if we come with a right mental attitude
[36:01] so the right mental attitude
[36:03] i want to believe that is a positive one
[36:07] the right mental attitude the right
[36:08] attitude is not the attitude when you
[36:11] come with a preconceived idea
[36:13] how many how many knows what is their
[36:15] preconceived idea
[36:17] you know a preconceived idea brother
[36:18] john is when i come
[36:20] to you to talk to you but i already have
[36:23] a conclusion
[36:25] preconceived idea is the one when i come
[36:28] to speak to you i already have
[36:29] a perception towards you i already have
[36:32] a
[36:33] a view no we come
[36:36] viewless tonight the only view we are
[36:39] going to
[36:40] hear is the view of the lord because
[36:42] because we want him to pour all
[36:45] of him in us we don't want him to pour
[36:48] himself in us
[36:49] and find out ah there's still a little
[36:50] bit of
[36:52] in there how will he fill that cup when
[36:55] there's still
[36:56] a bit of me in there no preconceived
[36:58] idea
[36:59] only positive arty my girls
[37:03] god bless you so we we we we we
[37:06] we want to look at what we want finish
[37:10] this is such a big salmon this is the
[37:12] word of god is a mountain of bread we'll
[37:14] never finish it
[37:16] we will eat it and the more we eat you
[37:18] know it's like it's increasing
[37:20] because it's so massive you can't finish
[37:24] it
[37:24] so we are just going to bite a little
[37:26] bit that we can buy to fill our bellies
[37:28] for tonight
[37:29] and we go home when we come back another
[37:32] minister will
[37:33] preach here and we fail again we want
[37:36] more
[37:37] and more and more of god every time as
[37:40] long as
[37:40] every time we come we come with an
[37:42] expected heart
[37:44] so the bible we read there in the book
[37:46] of john it says for whatsoever is born
[37:49] of god overcoming the world
[37:52] whoever is born of god overcome ever
[37:55] well
[37:56] we'll talk of a few things that are
[37:58] going to be showing
[37:59] us what is it what it takes to overcome
[38:03] what what
[38:04] what happens what what should
[38:08] you actually be doing for you to get
[38:10] this overcoming power that's what we're
[38:12] going to talk about
[38:12] just a few and then we'll go home when i
[38:15] mean few
[38:16] i mean few few slides just
[38:20] you see those you see that that outline
[38:22] that outline has got only seven points
[38:25] and you know seven is a powerful number
[38:27] are we together
[38:28] so each one of those topics there or sub
[38:31] heading
[38:32] has got only two slides
[38:35] maximum two not not more than two but
[38:38] mario two slides
[38:39] on average or one per topic
[38:42] then we go home isn't that lovely i
[38:46] think we will be full at that time
[38:48] those who want more they can stay then
[38:50] i'll continue
[38:52] so we'll we'll just look at
[38:55] what do we fight for
[39:00] what exactly are we fighting for
[39:03] it's not just victory we are fighting
[39:06] for life we are fighting for a kingdom
[39:08] we are fighting we are we are fighting
[39:12] who can tell me what we are fighting you
[39:13] know there's so much
[39:15] that is on our plate that is at stake
[39:17] that we are fighting for tonight
[39:18] i just put victory there but there's so
[39:20] much amen
[39:22] but when you're fighting for victory
[39:25] when you're fighting for faith when
[39:27] you're fighting for healing when you're
[39:28] fighting for answer
[39:29] when you're fighting for understanding
[39:33] for revelation for anything
[39:36] you go by the rules of the
[39:39] game that's the next aspect that we look
[39:42] at
[39:42] because if you don't go by the rules of
[39:44] the game you're going to
[39:46] fail you're going to be disqualified
[39:49] you'll be kicked out
[39:50] of the game because you are not
[39:52] following the rules of them
[39:54] so god also has got the rules of the
[39:56] game those rules of the game
[39:58] they are built in in his weight
[40:01] right we'll look at that then we look at
[40:04] uh how to keep on eating or drinking
[40:08] the weight because you cannot get this
[40:11] overcoming power
[40:12] if you are not eating it when i give the
[40:15] child food i expect him to eat in order
[40:18] to
[40:18] grow if he does not the opposite happens
[40:23] are we together you understand children
[40:25] i want the little ones also to follow me
[40:26] tonight
[40:27] i don't want you to sleep i don't want
[40:28] you if i see you warning two times i'll
[40:31] call your name
[40:32] amen okay then we'll look at number four
[40:35] a purpose-driven life
[40:37] the prophet teaches us that you know we
[40:39] we must have a purpose
[40:41] yes you know in life
[40:45] physical life the life here on earth
[40:47] we've got the purpose
[40:49] you know we've got a vision but now here
[40:52] in
[40:52] in this economy of god you must also
[40:54] have a purpose
[40:57] we'll talk about that we'll talk about
[41:00] uh
[41:01] the purpose for the things of god you
[41:03] know like saving
[41:04] testifying living the life in such a way
[41:07] you know having a purpose
[41:09] waking up every day with a peoples
[41:12] amen then we look at when do you get
[41:16] when do you get your overcoming your
[41:18] overcoming i meant to put an are there
[41:20] when do you get your overcoming when
[41:23] actually
[41:24] when do you start to get your overcoming
[41:26] power
[41:28] and i said that when you start to take
[41:32] your impossibilities head on
[41:35] the impossibilities i mean those things
[41:37] that that
[41:39] according to the flesh they are not
[41:41] possible
[41:42] when you start taking those things
[41:44] sister jenny
[41:45] you need to get healed when you start
[41:48] taking them head on because it doesn't
[41:51] matter
[41:53] if we take them head on or not
[41:56] the fact of the matter is that one of
[41:58] the tumors happen
[42:00] win or lose if we don't take them head
[42:04] on
[42:04] as the lord has told us then we lose but
[42:07] if we take them head on regardless of
[42:09] our circumstances
[42:11] you'll find that we win because the
[42:13] prophet said confess
[42:14] and confess and confess it until another
[42:17] songwriter said
[42:19] no matter what the circumstances or what
[42:21] i see
[42:22] or feel the word is working mightily
[42:26] in me that's the word of god
[42:29] so it doesn't matter what the face value
[42:32] is
[42:33] what the outside what the doctor
[42:36] what the work doesn't matter whether
[42:39] it's winter
[42:40] or summer the way it was spoken and it
[42:43] has to come
[42:44] to pass so my job is to confess it is to
[42:47] is to speak it as if it's already there
[42:50] so we'll talk we'll talk about that
[42:52] then we also talk about letting the
[42:54] pilot
[42:55] to do his work
[42:59] and that pilot he we must let him
[43:03] pilot this aeroplane we cannot go in the
[43:06] cockpit and try to help him
[43:10] you'll see because if you try to start
[43:12] to interfere with the that's why
[43:14] if you go in the airplane they lock that
[43:17] door
[43:18] to the cockpit it's locked so that i
[43:20] must not disturb i must have full
[43:22] confidence
[43:24] in the pilot to pilot this aeroplane
[43:27] then lastly we'll talk about the power
[43:29] to enforce what god spoke
[43:32] it needs to be enforced we'll talk about
[43:35] it
[43:35] so let's just start off the all these
[43:37] slides i've just typed what the prophet
[43:39] said
[43:40] i'm not gonna say much of my words but
[43:42] we'll just be reiterating
[43:44] knowing very well that you read and you
[43:46] listen to them
[43:47] but just to refresh us just to remind
[43:49] ourselves
[43:50] are we together as you know i'm not that
[43:52] much of a
[43:54] an international preacher i'm just a
[43:56] simple local brother
[43:58] so now here the prophet says
[44:02] so so many people today i find when they
[44:05] join a church
[44:07] here especially in america especially in
[44:10] new zealand
[44:12] they just become drifters
[44:15] do you know what is a drifter last time
[44:17] we spoke about
[44:18] a dead wood that looks so nice
[44:22] and big in the but but surprisingly it's
[44:25] just floating
[44:26] in this in this hard river and when you
[44:29] go to it you
[44:30] you check oh this is hollow inside
[44:33] yeah we mustn't be like those people we
[44:36] mustn't be like those people who are
[44:37] just
[44:38] drifters they are just well praise god i
[44:42] met brother branham and i've got say
[44:44] and i got saved and i put my name in the
[44:46] book
[44:47] and that's all all i've done just
[44:49] drifting
[44:50] we don't want to do that we don't want
[44:53] to do that
[44:54] no it's better if we don't get in the
[44:57] river in the first place
[45:00] it is better to do that because it's not
[45:02] helping you
[45:03] to float and not be part of the river
[45:06] you need to have some substance in the
[45:08] word of god amen you never got saved
[45:10] just to be a member of a church just to
[45:14] be a member
[45:15] no we are not looking for members are
[45:18] you brother ben
[45:19] we are we are not looking for any
[45:21] members brother andy
[45:22] yeah i believe for the cuban even if
[45:24] here we can just be seven
[45:26] huh i'm talking to the elders now
[45:29] brother
[45:30] brother phil even if we can just be
[45:32] seven of us
[45:35] we'll be sufficient isn't it i'm not
[45:37] saying go away
[45:38] i'm saying we are not looking for
[45:39] members
[45:41] god last time we said he does not look
[45:43] for count as according to
[45:45] numbers he weighs us
[45:49] so it's not help therefore just to be a
[45:52] member
[45:54] just to come to church i'm talking also
[45:57] to you young people
[45:58] just that's to say no no mom and papa
[46:00] are going my man dada
[46:01] okay uh where do you fellowship stokes
[46:04] really where what
[46:05] um what is your church
[46:09] you see when you grant those into stocks
[46:10] very no no no tell the person what you
[46:13] believe
[46:14] tell them that jesus christ that i serve
[46:17] he's done this and this and this and
[46:19] this and if you come to my church you'll
[46:21] find that kind of a life
[46:23] and my church by the way believes we
[46:26] believe
[46:26] i believe that god has sent a message
[46:30] today
[46:31] because the kingdom of god is is upon us
[46:34] he said what
[46:35] yes brother this world is about to
[46:37] finish we were told
[46:38] many many years ago why are you not told
[46:40] no
[46:41] just know that you are very lucky that
[46:43] i'm meeting you the world is coming to
[46:45] an
[46:45] end that was told to us secretly
[46:48] but it was revealed and told to me i
[46:50] want to tell you now
[46:52] it's coming to an end this world huh
[46:56] but have you been baptized dude what do
[46:58] you believe then you start to get the
[47:00] inroads
[47:01] but the more we don't tell then the
[47:03] people won't know what we believe
[47:05] find a way that god will express it
[47:08] through you i'm not prescribing
[47:10] how but i'm just saying just be open
[47:13] with what god has done for you in your
[47:15] life say what you believe
[47:17] you will never send anybody away by
[47:20] telling them what you believe
[47:22] if they go away and they don't accept it
[47:24] it was not meant to be
[47:26] but you have done the part you have done
[47:28] you have fulfilled the commission
[47:31] hallelujah so
[47:34] where was i you you got you got saved to
[47:38] work
[47:39] that's what we got saved to do not just
[47:42] to come
[47:42] and fill up the seas and fill up the
[47:44] numbers we got saved to work
[47:46] in this economy of god that's what we
[47:49] don't dress
[47:50] an army up just to lay around on the
[47:52] corner
[47:53] and fled with the girls huh with pretty
[47:56] uniforms on
[47:57] can you just imagine about it that's the
[47:59] prophet is not me i never read those
[48:02] let me just have a disclaimer at the end
[48:04] the prophet
[48:05] priesthood we we just we don't dress the
[48:08] soldiers
[48:09] in an army and spend you know the budget
[48:11] for the military is always the highest
[48:13] it's a huge military budget in every
[48:16] country
[48:18] why because they mean business we have
[48:20] to fight when there's a need
[48:22] when there's a time to fight we fight so
[48:24] we don't dress them and put
[48:26] spend so much just for them to be
[48:28] working in town and we say
[48:30] look at our army that's our army no
[48:33] they are supposed to fight and you and
[48:36] me what were we safe to do
[48:40] because the lord jesus showed us why
[48:43] he came here on earth and we are
[48:45] supposed to follow
[48:46] on his footsteps he was crucified
[48:49] we're supposed to be crucified he was ah
[48:53] was the weight he was ridiculed we must
[48:56] be ridiculed
[48:57] he suffered we must suffer
[49:03] so he lived a life we must live a life
[49:06] he was a simple man we must be simple
[49:08] men and women
[49:09] so everything that the lord jesus christ
[49:11] went through we must go through
[49:13] even more than that he said right so i'm
[49:15] gonna move with speed this is the only
[49:17] slide
[49:18] for that for that title so that's can
[49:20] you see
[49:21] my promise was true now we train
[49:24] our army to fight and we are not at a
[49:28] picnic
[49:31] beautiful country we live in with lots
[49:32] of parks and where we can have picnics
[49:35] but spiritually we are not in a picnic
[49:38] we know the day we fight every day we
[49:40] are on a battleground
[49:42] we are right here facing the enemy of
[49:44] our lord jesus
[49:45] and the enemy of our souls let us be up
[49:48] and doing with the heart
[49:50] of any for any strife
[49:53] that's what the prophet said that was
[49:55] taken from that message there
[49:57] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[49:59] our faith
[50:00] will be quoting from that a tape
[50:04] if we're changing the tape i'll tell you
[50:05] which one right
[50:07] so we need to be able to to come to a
[50:11] point where we fight for our victory
[50:13] and we must understand that this is a
[50:15] war and a war is not something where in
[50:17] the morning one day you wake up and say
[50:19] ah today i don't feel like fighting no
[50:22] it's a permanent situation until
[50:25] one of the sites say i surrender
[50:28] i'm defeated peace and raise a white
[50:30] flag
[50:31] that is going it's our lifetime and
[50:33] that's what we signed up for
[50:35] we signed up for that and now and and
[50:38] the lord promised to be with
[50:40] us and help us right let's move on
[50:43] what are the rules of the game you know
[50:46] today i didn't make a powerpoint so i'll
[50:47] be looking
[50:49] here and there if i can't see there i'll
[50:51] look here you don't mind it
[50:53] i know you're very nice people you don't
[50:55] mind for me to look here
[50:56] and give you my my back but i'll turn
[50:58] around and talk to you
[51:00] if i can't see there now
[51:03] and that's what that's the way we have
[51:05] to do the race
[51:07] of life that we are running now it has
[51:09] to be played according to
[51:11] god's qualifications and we
[51:14] will lose when we get there we will lose
[51:17] when we get there whether we are the
[51:20] president
[51:21] whether we are the governor or the
[51:23] minister or what church we belong to
[51:26] and what denomination the rules of the
[51:28] game has to be kept
[51:30] what are the rules of the game
[51:36] can tell me what are the rules of the
[51:37] game can somebody just take a try
[51:43] the word of god thank you brother who
[51:46] said that brother ben
[51:47] did you say that sister lita
[51:50] oh sister naomi thank you my sister the
[51:53] word of god is actually
[51:54] our rules we often here say oh
[51:58] you know we we are not a what do they
[52:02] call it
[52:02] liberal or oligar legalistic
[52:06] you know church
[52:09] we are not legalistic or liberal that's
[52:12] fine that's all good
[52:13] or we are liberal or we are not that is
[52:15] not the issue the issue is
[52:18] god has got rules but you see god's
[52:21] rules
[52:22] are not like the rules of the world the
[52:24] rules of the world are the do's and
[52:26] don'ts
[52:27] you know it do and don't thou shall not
[52:29] and thou shalt no
[52:31] the rules of of god are his word
[52:34] and because we signed up willingly
[52:37] by repentance to this we took god's word
[52:40] and it operates in our lives it's not
[52:43] something that we see as a burden
[52:45] as a load no no that's the rules that's
[52:48] how we operate
[52:49] the bible somewhere says you know god's
[52:52] mind
[52:53] is so strange it's different from our
[52:55] our physical mind
[52:57] god does not operate i like that message
[53:00] that brother isaac preached one day it
[53:01] blessed me so much
[53:02] it was like he took me back to before he
[53:05] came here on earth
[53:06] and i was imagining i was dramatizing
[53:08] seeing myself saying oh
[53:10] actually oh that's how it happened and i
[53:13] was like that
[53:14] and we now we are here i seem to have
[53:16] forgotten what happened then
[53:19] because there was a life before here
[53:22] and we came here and we've come in in
[53:24] this situation and we seem to
[53:26] we don't remember but the word of god is
[53:28] here to remind us
[53:29] now the rules these rules that we are
[53:32] talking about
[53:33] is that we must run it fair and we must
[53:36] play it by the rules we must
[53:38] preach the word we must do it willingly
[53:43] i've never heard about a woman who they
[53:45] say she got married
[53:47] okay it happens in some other cultures
[53:50] but that's not a legit marriage
[53:52] where she just get involved in a
[53:54] relationship unwillingly
[53:58] we are not that bright we got in
[54:00] willingly sister k
[54:01] isn't it we got in willingly and that is
[54:03] why we can't
[54:04] cannot come in willingly and then start
[54:06] to drift
[54:08] and we are going to operate according to
[54:10] the word of god which is the rules
[54:12] of the game otherwise we will be like
[54:14] that man who came in
[54:16] through the window and when when the man
[54:19] of the wedding saw him he said how did
[54:21] you come in here
[54:22] because he did not have a rope and he
[54:25] said to the messengers they must take
[54:27] him out
[54:28] and they kick him out so we don't want
[54:31] to be disqualified like that
[54:32] we come according to the rules and those
[54:35] rules
[54:35] are the word of god right we must preach
[54:38] it so and tonight
[54:40] as born again christian as believers
[54:42] here at the end time
[54:44] i believe we are in the end time now
[54:47] we've got to play the game according to
[54:50] the rules we've got to run
[54:51] with patience the race that is set
[54:53] before us looking
[54:55] to the author and finisher of our faith
[54:58] which is christ jesus and and he's the
[55:00] rule setter
[55:02] he does not set the rules that he can do
[55:05] himself
[55:06] no he's a very fair god he's a very fair
[55:10] empire or captain or whatever you can
[55:12] name him
[55:13] right he has not set the rules and say
[55:15] hey you will carry this thing there
[55:17] today but he doesn't carry it himself
[55:20] he's not like that
[55:21] he's a very fair
[55:24] employer i made a statement last time
[55:27] the other time i said you know we are
[55:29] not employed our satellites are not paid
[55:31] by our current employers
[55:34] if you know promotion it does not come
[55:36] from our our current employers brother
[55:38] brother brother cooper no our promotion
[55:42] our bonus our pay slips are paid from
[55:44] heaven
[55:46] not from our even our jobs i told my
[55:48] former boss many times ago many years
[55:50] ago
[55:51] i said you know if you don't want to
[55:52] hire me and a god wants
[55:55] me to be hired there's nothing you can
[55:57] do about it
[56:00] is i said yes that's the god i said
[56:04] if he wants me there and you
[56:07] don't want you can do nothing i'll be
[56:10] there
[56:12] he was amazed and i said to him
[56:16] if you don't if you want me there
[56:19] if you want me there and my god does not
[56:22] want me there
[56:23] there's nothing you can do to bring me
[56:25] there because my god does not want me
[56:27] there
[56:28] so that's how we operate those are the
[56:30] rules of god
[56:31] we hear from our head office our head
[56:33] office
[56:35] it's not here we've got a head office so
[56:37] in that whole head office i've got rules
[56:40] the rules that are not according to the
[56:42] rules of this earth
[56:44] and that's the word of god amen we are
[56:47] going back as brother andy says it to an
[56:49] idiotic condition
[56:50] how things were in eden in eden the
[56:54] rules were different and that's why we
[56:55] are go
[56:56] we are just almost there we are almost
[56:59] there
[57:00] we can feel eating almost we can feel it
[57:03] the rules of eden are already in
[57:04] operation here in our lives today
[57:07] we are just about to finish the last
[57:09] slap and we are in
[57:10] and it will be that will be fully there
[57:12] now this flesh will be out
[57:15] so those rules we are not going to start
[57:17] to practice them today
[57:20] they start here those rules
[57:23] is not rules like no you must hold your
[57:26] arms
[57:27] no it's not like that it's the rules
[57:29] that you must be free in the spirit
[57:32] ah my sister analysis i'm sorry to pick
[57:34] on you
[57:35] because he was falling arms but those
[57:37] rules are very different we cannot even
[57:39] think
[57:40] how those rules are because those rules
[57:42] are the word of god
[57:43] and is there given all we do to live by
[57:46] the rules
[57:47] we just leave the word of god on a daily
[57:49] basis
[57:50] are we together we'll jump to the next
[57:53] point
[57:55] keep on drinking and eating the weight i
[57:57] cannot over emphasize this point
[58:00] this is said over and over on this
[58:02] pulpit
[58:04] and we need to really remind ourselves
[58:06] that it cannot just be taught and
[58:08] preached
[58:09] taught and preached and then we don't do
[58:11] it
[58:13] john said we must be doers and not only
[58:15] hear us right so we must
[58:16] be able to come to a point where we eat
[58:20] until we get to be like enoch
[58:24] what is to eat the word of god you know
[58:28] you just that just by listening just by
[58:31] listening
[58:33] listening to the word of god and hearing
[58:36] it
[58:37] right and and consuming it with your
[58:39] spirit
[58:40] right in other words internalizing it
[58:44] okay i pray the lord will help me to
[58:46] express it the way that
[58:47] that that that i want to express it
[58:50] you know sometimes you i talked about
[58:52] the marion or i talked to
[58:54] brother phil
[58:58] andersen but you can hear that this
[59:00] person is not hearing you
[59:02] he say brother do you hear me why
[59:05] why do you say that when the man is
[59:07] looking at you
[59:09] because you can hear he's hearing you
[59:11] but he's not hearing you
[59:14] so we must when we eat the word of god
[59:15] we must really eat it
[59:18] eat it fully consuming it through
[59:22] getting through your system how can i
[59:23] put it through your spirit
[59:25] down into your soul we cannot eat it
[59:28] selectively
[59:29] like when other children don't want hey
[59:31] i don't want this vegetable
[59:33] i want no no no no we eat everything the
[59:35] whole lot
[59:36] sweet and bitter we eat it and we we eat
[59:39] it and swallow it
[59:41] so that it can benefit us that is why
[59:43] here the prophet says
[59:45] oh then what do you have to do is to
[59:48] drink
[59:48] drink and keep on are we there
[59:52] we have to drink and drink from this
[59:54] fountain and keep on drinking
[59:56] because that is where our growth that is
[59:59] where
[1:00:00] our rapture lies don't don't just stop
[1:00:04] when you join a church and baptize
[1:00:06] and then you just keep on just keep on
[1:00:09] drinking
[1:00:10] you have faith that for this and faith
[1:00:13] for that and
[1:00:14] faith for this and push out until all
[1:00:16] the manifestations of the holy spirit is
[1:00:18] living in a
[1:00:19] church that's what will happen if we
[1:00:22] keep on drinking and drinking and
[1:00:24] drinking
[1:00:25] by drinking i don't mean you don't
[1:00:26] listen to the tapes i don't mean you
[1:00:28] don't eat your weight
[1:00:29] but consume it
[1:00:34] i'm licking the vocabulary to express it
[1:00:36] to eat the word of god
[1:00:38] is not just to just to listen
[1:00:42] absentmindedly or listening it
[1:00:45] because the pastor sent someone for us
[1:00:47] to listen
[1:00:48] there's no compliance you know
[1:00:50] compliance
[1:00:51] [Laughter]
[1:00:52] those who work in the auditing and fine
[1:00:54] finance you know every month we must
[1:00:56] submit the financials or
[1:00:59] every year the auditors must come and
[1:01:01] they take the boxes oh no
[1:01:02] we've complied with that you know all
[1:01:04] those who are in safety builders they
[1:01:06] know
[1:01:07] when we put those talents that vanille
[1:01:10] you know
[1:01:10] it must be according to the rules we
[1:01:13] must comply
[1:01:14] so some people when they do the jobs we
[1:01:16] just do it for compliance
[1:01:19] if the inspector come and open whoa
[1:01:22] underneath there like but the end was
[1:01:24] saying it's just vanilla on top
[1:01:26] at the bottom
[1:01:30] you don't want to see there so we are
[1:01:31] not doing compliance whether
[1:01:33] i'm with someone whether the pastor sent
[1:01:36] a tape in fact
[1:01:37] we must remind the pastor hey pastor you
[1:01:39] have not sent the tape i'm ready to
[1:01:41] consume
[1:01:42] huh we must be ready last time we spoke
[1:01:46] about hunger
[1:01:48] so we must be ready thirsty and hungry
[1:01:51] to
[1:01:52] consume and to drink
[1:01:55] from the inside from the very inside
[1:01:58] not selectively i i i you know when i
[1:02:01] grew up
[1:02:02] and don't love it i say when i grew up
[1:02:05] we used to eat meat
[1:02:07] brother queen you know those who grew up
[1:02:09] poor
[1:02:10] when we eat meat because it was only
[1:02:12] coming once in a while
[1:02:13] we eat that bone of a chicken and and it
[1:02:16] is smooth
[1:02:17] if possible you you break even that bone
[1:02:20] and eat it
[1:02:22] you see so i don't believe it i must eat
[1:02:25] if there's a bone you must throw it away
[1:02:27] no that bone must not have a piece of
[1:02:29] meat on it
[1:02:30] it must be clean if you see that you are
[1:02:33] eating and you throw some other bones
[1:02:35] with meat i'm sorry if you do that
[1:02:37] and you throw in the bin some bones
[1:02:39] still have meat you're actually wasting
[1:02:41] you are wasting why did we give you meat
[1:02:44] for you to throw away
[1:02:45] no it has got bones with bones
[1:02:48] in the bone if you care
[1:02:50] [Laughter]
[1:02:53] make sure that that bone has got no
[1:02:55] piece of meat otherwise
[1:02:56] why is papa going to work every morning
[1:02:59] for you to eat
[1:03:00] so make sure you eat limbo
[1:03:07] spirit on the spiritual side that's what
[1:03:09] i'm talking about we need to make sure
[1:03:11] that we
[1:03:12] drink we eat because
[1:03:15] that is what is going to bring the
[1:03:16] manifestation of the spirit
[1:03:18] in the to the living i mean to the
[1:03:20] living church of god amen
[1:03:22] that is what because and tonight we
[1:03:24] understand that if you plant a tree and
[1:03:26] you irrigate it
[1:03:28] it it to drink and it draws its strength
[1:03:31] from the water on earth
[1:03:33] until it pushes out and bears fruits
[1:03:36] and that's what we want that's what we
[1:03:38] want that a child must eat and grow
[1:03:41] and start to push and help branches and
[1:03:43] start to have their fruits
[1:03:45] and bear fruits because if
[1:03:48] my mother is a farmer if she plants a
[1:03:51] tree
[1:03:52] she's got like green green hands they
[1:03:54] say green hands
[1:03:56] she can plant anything if she plans and
[1:03:58] it does not
[1:03:59] start to do what she wants she takes it
[1:04:01] out
[1:04:03] if he does not grow properly and he can
[1:04:06] this one is going to waste my water
[1:04:08] and my soil food it must go out she
[1:04:10] plucks it out
[1:04:12] gets the right tree that will bear
[1:04:13] fruits
[1:04:15] one day she even planted a he planted a
[1:04:19] an orange tree and it grew nicely
[1:04:22] and bare fruits oranges but when we ate
[1:04:25] those oranges they were not sweet
[1:04:28] ah she she looked at these cheese what
[1:04:31] can i do
[1:04:33] i she didn't plug it out because it was
[1:04:36] bearing fruits
[1:04:38] she went and bite and bought 12.5
[1:04:40] kilogram of sugar
[1:04:46] the next season she put it she put it
[1:04:47] there on the tree
[1:04:49] that's sugar now strangely enough
[1:04:52] that sugar was processed by the soil it
[1:04:55] was processed
[1:04:56] when the oranges came they were so nice
[1:04:59] [Laughter]
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:03] so so so we must not do that that's what
[1:05:06] my mother did but
[1:05:08] we must bear fruits that are even sweet
[1:05:12] not just the fruits that people use ah i
[1:05:14] don't it's already
[1:05:15] so we must bear fruits that are sweet
[1:05:19] and that can only happen if we drink and
[1:05:22] we eat
[1:05:23] the word of god right and we bear those
[1:05:25] fruit it draws
[1:05:26] more than its portion more than
[1:05:29] here in the gospel we work according to
[1:05:31] different rules
[1:05:32] in the gospel in the message in the word
[1:05:35] of god when a child
[1:05:36] is too much like brother brother a
[1:05:40] brother the failure was listening
[1:05:41] yesterday to their service he said we
[1:05:43] are we are latinas
[1:05:44] you know we we we don't we don't we
[1:05:46] don't reprimand children for eating too
[1:05:48] much
[1:05:49] according to the rules of the world they
[1:05:51] must eat until they can't eat anymore
[1:05:54] but in the world they say no no no don't
[1:05:56] eat you'll be obese
[1:05:57] in the word we want you to be obese
[1:06:02] can you see different rules there it's
[1:06:04] not there is different rules
[1:06:05] of the game in the world we want you to
[1:06:08] so so that we can expand the door
[1:06:11] through there so that if you can't fit
[1:06:12] we expand it
[1:06:14] for you and the lord will make a big
[1:06:17] door
[1:06:18] double door for you to come because
[1:06:20] you'll be strong in the way
[1:06:23] you will be able to create another f
[1:06:26] that's that's what that power of the
[1:06:27] word will give you you'll be there i
[1:06:29] want another planet there because you'll
[1:06:32] be so strong
[1:06:33] you'll be so big and it's so simple
[1:06:36] because ah that one he was that one
[1:06:39] johnny
[1:06:40] i know no that one is the one who go to
[1:06:42] him to pray for you
[1:06:45] go to john to pray for you he said john
[1:06:48] from taranaki
[1:06:49] yes that one you mean
[1:06:59] then he said yes go to him he'll pray
[1:07:02] for you
[1:07:03] if you go according to the rules you're
[1:07:05] going to go brother john the lord said i
[1:07:06] must come to you to pray for me
[1:07:09] not how i know you not how i hate about
[1:07:11] you not how i see you no
[1:07:14] the lord said i must come to you to pray
[1:07:15] for me
[1:07:17] didn't he say that king must go to
[1:07:19] abraham
[1:07:20] but abraham just lied yes
[1:07:23] and he said go to abraham to the men who
[1:07:25] lied
[1:07:26] yes why because he's the son of god he's
[1:07:29] full of the fruits of god
[1:07:31] if you go to him if you go to brother
[1:07:33] branham yes
[1:07:35] with his mistakes go to him
[1:07:38] he's your prophet that one who no no no

[1:07:43] yes that one that one you're saying you
[1:07:46] can't dedicate himself that's for you
[1:07:48] but you go to him to pray for you
[1:07:52] those people in sakana tabernacle is
[1:07:55] there pastor benny
[1:07:56] those ones yes those ones those are
[1:07:59] yours that's
[1:08:00] brother adrian said at the last camp he
[1:08:01] said you know we've got
[1:08:03] we've been given the authority we are
[1:08:05] the only access to eternal life
[1:08:07] not in a proud and boastful way but we
[1:08:10] are the access
[1:08:11] to eternal life for people of the world
[1:08:13] and the sooner we realize this the
[1:08:15] better
[1:08:18] are you in agreement elizabeth you and
[1:08:21] me
[1:08:21] have been given the power access to give
[1:08:24] people to teach them eternal life for
[1:08:27] you
[1:08:28] eternal life eternal life eternal life
[1:08:30] and you can't say no yeah i can't give
[1:08:32] you no
[1:08:32] eternal life you give them because we
[1:08:34] have been given access
[1:08:36] to give them and you are going to do it
[1:08:39] with love the way the lord jesus did it
[1:08:43] amen let's move on
[1:08:47] now a purpose-driven life this is a very
[1:08:50] passionate topic even in the world
[1:08:52] because the world says it from the time
[1:08:53] from from the approach and perspective
[1:08:56] of being you know successful
[1:08:59] of being you know you know being you
[1:09:01] know
[1:09:02] properly oriented about what you want to
[1:09:05] achieve
[1:09:06] but you see to be a purpose to have a
[1:09:08] purpose-driven life
[1:09:10] is have a mission an intended goal to
[1:09:13] achieve
[1:09:14] that's merit that's me who wrote there
[1:09:15] that's not the prophet that statement
[1:09:17] right for example to save souls now
[1:09:21] now each and every young person
[1:09:24] we expect you to have a purpose
[1:09:28] fathers and mothers i used to tell
[1:09:30] people that
[1:09:31] you know families a family of us have
[1:09:34] its own mission statement
[1:09:36] what do we want to achieve as a family
[1:09:38] and the end of the year
[1:09:39] there's a an annual meeting that brother
[1:09:41] isaac holds with his family
[1:09:43] and he changed that meeting he's okay
[1:09:45] guys jesse come
[1:09:46] what did we achieve this year what what
[1:09:48] was our mistakes
[1:09:50] and we checked that and we we then we we
[1:09:52] re-strategize
[1:09:54] now we have to have a purpose-driven
[1:09:58] life with christ and the christ have
[1:10:01] already given
[1:10:02] us the peoples amen the church today
[1:10:05] has got a bigger building than it ever
[1:10:07] had
[1:10:08] better churches better dress people
[1:10:10] better living people than ever ahead
[1:10:12] but oh brother there's not the thing
[1:10:15] that's not
[1:10:16] the thing those things will perish
[1:10:19] we've got the big we've got the victory
[1:10:22] we've got to fight
[1:10:23] we've got to do something for the
[1:10:25] kingdom of god
[1:10:27] that's where our people's lives our
[1:10:29] purpose
[1:10:30] should be about
[1:10:36] that's supposed to be our purpose i
[1:10:38] understand everything else of the flesh
[1:10:40] that's well and good in any case it's
[1:10:43] only coping from the spiritual
[1:10:45] so it's the spiritual side it's our
[1:10:47] spiritual life first
[1:10:48] then our purpose in life physically
[1:10:52] will be lined up so we need to have a
[1:10:55] purpose
[1:10:56] me this year my new year resolution
[1:11:00] there's nothing wrong with a new year
[1:11:01] resolution
[1:11:02] no my new year resolution can be this
[1:11:05] year
[1:11:06] my new year resolution lord with your
[1:11:08] permission with your will

[1:11:49] you know because because let's make no
[1:11:52] mistake we sit down and spend a lot of
[1:11:54] time

[1:11:57] should be what we want to achieve
[1:11:58] what what you want to work hard towards
[1:12:00] every day even before you sleep
[1:12:03] and talking to honey say honey oh you

[1:12:35] a purpose for we've got to
[1:12:38] purpose in our hearts we've got to do
[1:12:40] something now you say oh
[1:12:42] we are having a revival yeah we are over
[1:12:47] in the eisenhower school auditorium
[1:12:50] that's where they were during this
[1:12:51] message
[1:12:52] don't let that be you just floater and a
[1:12:55] drifter
[1:12:56] you can't you can never amount to
[1:12:58] anything like that
[1:12:59] let's get up to do something about it
[1:13:02] let's put our shoulder on the wheel
[1:13:05] let's see that our chest
[1:13:06] prospers let's get the kingdom
[1:13:09] prospering
[1:13:10] the economy of heaven that's what we
[1:13:13] need to do
[1:13:14] and never underestimate that is too
[1:13:16] small i can't do it
[1:13:19] are we together how many agrees with the
[1:13:22] prophet
[1:13:24] now purpose driven life is still
[1:13:26] continuing
[1:13:27] we've got to pay for something we've got
[1:13:29] something to do with it something to do
[1:13:31] for the purpose that's why john said
[1:13:35] don't let's not just be do us i mean
[1:13:37] hear us
[1:13:38] but do us do us it goes even beyond
[1:13:42] how i live my life it means to go around
[1:13:46] giving people
[1:13:47] what i was freely given until people can
[1:13:50] say ah
[1:13:52] he's here the pastor they call you
[1:13:55] pastor
[1:13:57] when you are a lady i don't know what
[1:13:58] they will call you
[1:14:01] you know some of us are giving names
[1:14:02] whenever we arrive and you don't know
[1:14:04] who told them they just already know
[1:14:06] that oh no no
[1:14:07] you know samsung that was that that
[1:14:09] picture guy
[1:14:11] so they must give you names and if you
[1:14:14] know that now i'm doing a great job for
[1:14:16] god
[1:14:16] i'm giving names which means i'm doing
[1:14:18] some work for god
[1:14:22] and we'll go to the next slide because
[1:14:24] i'm checking my time carefully
[1:14:25] find your ambition have a purpose that
[1:14:28] you are going
[1:14:29] to be healed for the glory of god you
[1:14:32] see
[1:14:33] that's where the key is everything that
[1:14:35] we ambition
[1:14:36] everything that we prop we propose it
[1:14:38] has to be for the glory of god
[1:14:41] if we come with that approach we will
[1:14:43] find that we are successful
[1:14:45] because we don't want to bring praise
[1:14:47] unto ourselves
[1:14:49] we are doing it for the glory of god
[1:14:51] right if i want to come and stand here
[1:14:53] and brother ben says preacher say yes so
[1:14:55] that i can be praised
[1:14:56] wrong so that they can say hello
[1:14:59] oh brother oh brother no no wrong
[1:15:03] it must be for the glory of god or else
[1:15:05] sit down
[1:15:07] right it must be for the glory of god
[1:15:09] otherwise who am i
[1:15:12] who am i it must be for the glory of god
[1:15:16] for the economy of our father for our
[1:15:19] kingdom
[1:15:20] i'm going to receive it and you'll get
[1:15:22] it yesterday
[1:15:23] you will get it if you come with
[1:15:25] attitude that i will get the healing
[1:15:27] i will i will do this for the lord i'm
[1:15:29] determined the lord
[1:15:30] is willing he has given his word for me
[1:15:32] to do this he will do it
[1:15:34] and he will achieve it by his help amen
[1:15:38] right when do you get your overcoming
[1:15:41] now this is very interesting because
[1:15:44] there are certain things that when the
[1:15:46] world look at them they are impossible
[1:15:49] there are certain things that our flesh
[1:15:51] does not agree with us to do
[1:15:53] there are certain things that when when
[1:15:56] we start to think of them even our
[1:15:58] our mind go against that
[1:16:01] but the moment we start taking those
[1:16:02] things the moment we start
[1:16:04] heading taking them head on the
[1:16:07] impossibilities
[1:16:08] according to the world impossibles
[1:16:11] that's when we start to overcome that's
[1:16:13] when we start to get the power
[1:16:15] the moment we start to to you'll see now
[1:16:17] in the last slide
[1:16:18] when we talk about enforcing the moment
[1:16:20] we start taking
[1:16:21] mountains there's a song that i wanted
[1:16:23] to sing for you that you know
[1:16:24] that have you got rivers that are
[1:16:27] uncrossable
[1:16:28] do you have them have you got mountains
[1:16:30] that that that that you cannot
[1:16:32] climb you've got a god who can tunnel
[1:16:36] who can tunnel them through
[1:16:38] god can take you through the rivers that
[1:16:40] are uncrossable
[1:16:42] he can do that but the moment we we go
[1:16:45] according to our mind and say oh no
[1:16:47] no no let us start to take our
[1:16:49] impossibilities
[1:16:51] because those things before god they are
[1:16:53] possible
[1:16:55] all things are possible the only thing
[1:16:58] that is not possible
[1:16:59] is that he cannot fail so we don't even
[1:17:02] have to talk about it because
[1:17:04] that one is not even a discussion with
[1:17:07] god all things are possible the only
[1:17:10] thing is that he cannot
[1:17:11] fail everything that he says
[1:17:14] will come to pass so my job is to just
[1:17:17] keep on doing it
[1:17:18] keep on believing it amen
[1:17:21] look at these guys and er not these guys
[1:17:24] sorry
[1:17:25] i don't like the way guys unless i'm
[1:17:28] talking to guys
[1:17:30] but if i hear my daughter saying guys i
[1:17:32] said ah you're saying to me and your mom
[1:17:34] guys
[1:17:36] you know the young people nowadays they
[1:17:37] say okay good night guys guys
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:42] so but that's where we are brother isaac
[1:17:45] they say to us
[1:17:46] good night mom and dad instead of that
[1:17:47] it's a good night guys see you tomorrow
[1:17:50] guys so
[1:17:54] these are not the guys these are the
[1:17:57] clouds of witnesses
[1:18:00] something happened in the office when i
[1:18:01] was preparing there i'm preparing and
[1:18:03] finalizing
[1:18:04] then this slide is number nine if i'm
[1:18:07] not mistaken
[1:18:08] and when i come to talk about these
[1:18:10] people these brothers
[1:18:11] brothers and sisters here i didn't put
[1:18:13] sisters here or that
[1:18:15] but i didn't put them but then i found
[1:18:18] that
[1:18:19] that slide was number nine even in the
[1:18:22] previous semon was number nine
[1:18:24] when i talk about these people it came
[1:18:26] on the same slide
[1:18:27] i said how did this happen i want to
[1:18:30] talk about these people
[1:18:31] and they are there these people here
[1:18:33] noah
[1:18:34] they took the impossibilities because in
[1:18:37] the days of noah it was not possible
[1:18:39] what no wanted to do what noah was
[1:18:41] preaching was not possible
[1:18:43] but noah did not look at that noah
[1:18:46] looked at
[1:18:46] what god said not what his possible
[1:18:49] mind reasoning was saying that's what
[1:18:52] noah did he
[1:18:54] he was a fool in the language of that
[1:18:57] day he was a stupid
[1:18:59] how can you say you are building an act
[1:19:01] to put people in
[1:19:02] how how can you say that we must believe
[1:19:04] you that's gonna go up in the rapture
[1:19:07] what what are you talking about that's
[1:19:10] how they'll ask you today
[1:19:12] same with abraham i mean sister bronwyn
[1:19:15] she's a nurse isn't it
[1:19:17] you know that a woman when she passed a
[1:19:20] certain stage
[1:19:21] of life he cannot bear children anymore
[1:19:25] now how can you tell us that you are
[1:19:27] going to have a child
[1:19:29] when you are already this age and your
[1:19:31] wife let's just think about that
[1:19:33] that is impossible but abraham took that
[1:19:37] impossibility head on
[1:19:39] because why he did not look at what is
[1:19:42] possible according to
[1:19:43] the worldly language what is possible
[1:19:46] and what's not possible he just looked
[1:19:47] at what god said
[1:19:48] and if we come like that today
[1:19:52] i do not talk about only abraham i want
[1:19:55] to say today
[1:19:56] if you've got a situation or you're in
[1:19:58] your life or something that is a problem
[1:20:03] what's wrong in coming in the same
[1:20:05] attitude yeah
[1:20:07] what's wrong what's wrong in just
[1:20:10] standing
[1:20:10] and just just becoming a fool for christ
[1:20:13] and say me
[1:20:14] i'm gonna stand here i'm not moving i'm
[1:20:16] going to stand here
[1:20:17] and that's what god said in his word and
[1:20:20] i'm going to believe it and confess it
[1:20:22] let me be like abraham and see if my
[1:20:24] eyes cannot come i'm going i'm not going
[1:20:26] to move
[1:20:27] even if i die i'm going to stand here
[1:20:30] because god said he will save my family
[1:20:32] and i'm gonna stand here
[1:20:36] why can't we enforce that because we we
[1:20:39] are too quick to speak about abraham
[1:20:42] we are too weak to say moses took his
[1:20:44] wife and children and went to egypt
[1:20:47] it's easy for me to say that but we want
[1:20:50] the moses today
[1:20:51] to say ah my father is sick my father is
[1:20:54] healed
[1:20:55] i'm standing there i'm refusing
[1:20:58] that my father can be healed that must
[1:21:00] be our attitude
[1:21:02] isn't it joshua you can think about them
[1:21:04] sangha do you
[1:21:06] is it is it reasonable that one man
[1:21:09] can can beat a whole legion of
[1:21:12] philistines one man
[1:21:13] and they killed 600 is it sometimes the
[1:21:16] thing that the bible says
[1:21:17] that's why it's unbelievable it's
[1:21:20] unbelievable
[1:21:21] now the opposite of unbelievable is
[1:21:24] believable
[1:21:25] now we are on that side of believer bull
[1:21:28] we believe it we believe in
[1:21:31] unbelievables
[1:21:33] so that's what we need to do we must
[1:21:35] take it
[1:21:36] as it happened i mean let's not go too
[1:21:38] far
[1:21:39] in the days of brother branham when he
[1:21:41] was here on earth
[1:21:42] he prayed for the people right
[1:21:46] and they got healed and he made a
[1:21:49] statement and said
[1:21:50] it is not me it is your faith so today
[1:21:53] we need to we're not going very far
[1:21:55] we're not going back to abraham
[1:21:57] we are just going to here in 1962 1662
[1:22:01] in the message uh
[1:22:05] restoration of the bride tree he was
[1:22:07] praying to the people
[1:22:08] telling them that you are mrs robertson
[1:22:11] you are missing sorry so you come from
[1:22:12] alabama
[1:22:14] huh why can't why can't that happen
[1:22:17] among us today
[1:22:18] are we the bride we are the bride that's
[1:22:21] one number one
[1:22:22] and the point number two we that must be
[1:22:25] our daily
[1:22:26] purpose lord bring us to the days of
[1:22:29] brother branham
[1:22:30] bring us to the days of abraham enough
[1:22:32] we shouldn't be struggling about ah
[1:22:34] ah is that sister is that one who spoke
[1:22:36] no no
[1:22:38] those things of who's speaking about who
[1:22:40] about what
[1:22:41] are not even supposed to be ahead among
[1:22:44] us the fast and skews and problems
[1:22:47] of here are delaying us we are supposed
[1:22:50] we have been called with an expensive
[1:22:52] calling a high calling
[1:22:55] that's our calling and at the moment we
[1:22:56] realize oh
[1:22:58] i have been underprivileging myself
[1:23:03] i'm supposed not to be there to say
[1:23:06] yes tell me brother i knew he hates me
[1:23:08] tell me
[1:23:10] what did what did she say about me
[1:23:12] sister no noelle
[1:23:14] i've always seen her that she doesn't no
[1:23:15] no come on adults
[1:23:18] come on now those things are not even
[1:23:21] supposed to be ahead among us
[1:23:22] in this today today earning initiation
[1:23:25] and sleeping we are not even supposed to
[1:23:28] be preaching about those things
[1:23:30] right now we are supposed to be hey
[1:23:33] standing up
[1:23:38] saying hey we want more
[1:23:41] we want the pastor to go and dig brother
[1:23:43] and all the ministers to go and dig
[1:23:45] deeper to bring to us the food
[1:23:48] that's why our focus and our purpose
[1:23:50] every day is supposed to be that is how
[1:23:52] enoch
[1:23:53] did it yes that's why eventually he just
[1:23:56] walked with god
[1:23:58] no no no no we're not supposed to be
[1:23:59] fast we look at that
[1:24:01] check check your pastor if you want to
[1:24:03] see the position of the church
[1:24:05] check him i look at him maybe he's not
[1:24:08] aware but i check him
[1:24:09] i look at him carefully how he works
[1:24:12] when he walks like this then i also walk
[1:24:14] like this
[1:24:17] you see that's what you must do that's
[1:24:20] what you must do
[1:24:21] when when when when he's crying before
[1:24:23] the lord cry before the lord
[1:24:27] because because he is our sharepoint we
[1:24:30] are not uplifting him as a man the
[1:24:31] spirit that god to put in the church and
[1:24:33] on him
[1:24:34] so that's how we need to do this thing
[1:24:36] of saying
[1:24:37] we are too independent we are too much
[1:24:39] on laodicea we are
[1:24:40] we are taught that we are now in bright
[1:24:43] age
[1:24:44] bright age is no more about interested
[1:24:47] about what did brother phil say about
[1:24:49] you
[1:24:51] sisters
[1:24:56] and brothers brothers no
[1:24:59] no no let's not understand ourselves
[1:25:03] let us not sell ourselves too cheap
[1:25:07] the bible says we have been called
[1:25:10] with i'm talking about situations where
[1:25:15] even if you're not talking to someone
[1:25:16] but you're thinking about it
[1:25:18] in your mind you say yeah you're
[1:25:20] entertaining that thought
[1:25:22] about that sister negatively why
[1:25:26] why why must i be saying no yes
[1:25:30] no i'm supposed to rebuke satan the
[1:25:33] moment he comes to my thought about mr
[1:25:35] melissa
[1:25:36] i'm supposed to go and say my sister
[1:25:37] forgive me last night the devil gave
[1:25:40] me a wrong thought about you but i stood
[1:25:42] up
[1:25:43] and i prayed for you yes that's how it
[1:25:46] must be
[1:25:47] to expose the devil that's how it must
[1:25:49] be
[1:25:50] we are not supposed to be shallow we
[1:25:52] said
[1:25:53] last time in conclusion
[1:25:57] our impossibilities must mirror of those
[1:26:00] ones
[1:26:02] our impossibilities must mirror the ones
[1:26:04] of brother branham
[1:26:07] we must come to that point we we must
[1:26:10] come to the point where
[1:26:12] even us because otherwise
[1:26:15] we are waiting for god to force us
[1:26:17] because one thing for sure
[1:26:19] is that we are god's children you are
[1:26:20] the bride and
[1:26:22] i do you want god to come and force you
[1:26:26] huh the king david said lord
[1:26:29] lord no no i cannot wait for that let me
[1:26:32] save you
[1:26:36] all my heart with everything that i have
[1:26:39] i'm better with you lord i'm better
[1:26:42] saving you
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:51] what what happened to them their task
[1:26:54] was to face them
[1:26:55] by faith those impossibilities because
[1:26:58] it was up to
[1:27:00] god to fulfill them
[1:27:03] it's not up to me whether and how
[1:27:06] my dad is going to be healed or how
[1:27:11] whatever problem whatever situation
[1:27:14] whatever
[1:27:15] the problem is that many times we want
[1:27:17] to solve our own problems
[1:27:18] we take god's job when he said to me
[1:27:21] believe me
[1:27:23] and if that's the problem then we must
[1:27:25] pray against it
[1:27:27] and cast it away so that we can have
[1:27:30] freedom to pray
[1:27:31] without any obstacles so that we can
[1:27:33] believe god without no questions
[1:27:36] that's why we need to come
[1:27:39] it's up to god what can we do we can't
[1:27:42] even heal ourselves
[1:27:44] not even a tooth pain yeah we cannot
[1:27:47] even what i don't want to demean you
[1:27:50] i don't want to make you small i i i'm
[1:27:53] trying to help you to show that you are
[1:27:58] small
[1:28:00] only him he's big and he can do
[1:28:03] everything
[1:28:03] for us ours is to surrender
[1:28:06] and just follow and believe his word
[1:28:08] fully yeah
[1:28:13] let's allow the pilot to pilot i've
[1:28:16] never heard
[1:28:17] of anyone who goes in the airplane and
[1:28:20] start to ask the pilot how is it is he
[1:28:23] going to do it
[1:28:25] the prophet says he dramatizes well now
[1:28:28] when i go
[1:28:29] when i go overseas and i go and and i go
[1:28:31] here as big sheep
[1:28:32] sitting there a big airship seven times
[1:28:35] around and i flew
[1:28:37] this thing around i don't say say i
[1:28:40] don't go
[1:28:40] say hey hey pilot and before i go onto
[1:28:42] the ship you will tell me how much scope
[1:28:44] them
[1:28:45] how much you scope them each one of
[1:28:47] those props have
[1:28:48] give a has give me all the mechanics of
[1:28:51] how this plane
[1:28:52] will operate do you do that
[1:28:55] and tell me how high can you climb all
[1:28:58] the mechanics i don't ask all those
[1:29:00] things
[1:29:00] i know the ship went across the someone
[1:29:03] else if
[1:29:04] the ship went across with someone else
[1:29:06] it will it will go across
[1:29:08] me with me so i'll just climb aboard
[1:29:11] and get on my seat and sit down
[1:29:14] and it's up to the pilot to see that it
[1:29:17] gets there
[1:29:18] right even the doctor we just go
[1:29:22] there he says open your mouth you open
[1:29:24] close you close
[1:29:26] ah say that assistant another she'll
[1:29:27] tell you they tell them
[1:29:29] open white you open it wide close
[1:29:33] close huh
[1:29:36] wait and he take that little stick and
[1:29:38] he checked on the side you don't you
[1:29:39] don't say
[1:29:40] wha why why are you doing that no no you
[1:29:42] just open
[1:29:43] why because you believe in him huh he
[1:29:46] says raise up your head
[1:29:48] he said oh no sorry i forgot i mean your
[1:29:49] feet you raised
[1:29:51] because you believe in him that he's

[1:31:02] because you've got confidence and faith
[1:31:05] in what he's
[1:31:06] doing and that's how we should be on
[1:31:08] christ
[1:31:09] that is how how solid and faithful we
[1:31:12] are supposed to be
[1:31:14] on anything that we want
[1:31:19] the same applies to when you go to the
[1:31:21] doctor that's what i was trying to tell
[1:31:22] you now
[1:31:23] when you he give you a pill you don't
[1:31:25] analyze and ask him the chemical
[1:31:27] analysis of the tablet
[1:31:29] that is giving you or the pills you
[1:31:32] believe
[1:31:33] that don't you don't you brethren just
[1:31:36] accept it on the basis that
[1:31:38] god said so and let god be god again
[1:31:42] brother ben
[1:31:42] we does not have to accept it we must
[1:31:45] not be preoccupied about our ideas and
[1:31:47] wanting to help god no
[1:31:49] we cannot succeed like that we just have
[1:31:52] to accept it
[1:31:53] that god said so and that's how
[1:31:56] we will overcome that's how we'll get
[1:31:58] our overcoming power
[1:31:59] and that's the same thing about taking
[1:32:02] this
[1:32:03] gospel i like that you know
[1:32:06] when i saw that i said i must put that
[1:32:08] in red
[1:32:10] so that everyone can see a gospel tablet
[1:32:14] we must swallow it and drink it
[1:32:17] bitter or not bitter the better the
[1:32:20] better
[1:32:22] i can tell you all about that about it
[1:32:24] but i know
[1:32:25] it works it works right
[1:32:29] now lastly the power to enforce
[1:32:32] amen there come a time in the life of
[1:32:35] every believer where you must enforce
[1:32:37] the word of god now here i say the seal
[1:32:40] of god is the weight
[1:32:42] right of god now that seal of god
[1:32:45] you know i still still is something in
[1:32:47] the olden days you know like a stamp
[1:32:50] if you see that brother ben signed here
[1:32:52] and put
[1:32:53] you know that you can do it brother
[1:32:55] isaac
[1:32:56] that oh the pastor said we the testis
[1:32:58] can go and buy this this is his still
[1:33:00] yes we are not going to ask the church
[1:33:02] first and say brothers what do you think
[1:33:03] no the pastor put his seal
[1:33:05] huh there we go when i was working for
[1:33:08] brother andy
[1:33:09] i remember marion said no brother we
[1:33:10] just buy brother andy gave you still
[1:33:12] you just take the receipt to their
[1:33:13] sisters they will refund you
[1:33:15] and that happened and i was amazed it
[1:33:18] happened
[1:33:18] i've got the fun day isn't it mario
[1:33:23] so when they say seal the word of god is
[1:33:26] the seal of god
[1:33:28] it gives you got all the approvals you
[1:33:30] need in here
[1:33:31] all the promises the promises and all
[1:33:35] everything that you need has been given
[1:33:37] to you with the seal of god
[1:33:39] approved promise healing everything
[1:33:42] happiness
[1:33:43] what what you can name it right the
[1:33:46] solution
[1:33:46] is here so now now now the word was
[1:33:49] broken and sealed it has been fulfilled
[1:33:52] as it was spoken it is impossible for
[1:33:55] god's word
[1:33:56] to go out and and not be fulfilled it's
[1:33:59] impossible
[1:34:00] it is not possible for god's word to be
[1:34:02] spoken and not be fulfilled
[1:34:05] that is not even something we must worry
[1:34:07] about if he said it
[1:34:09] it will happen right now that seal of
[1:34:12] god
[1:34:13] is called uh two things judgment
[1:34:16] and promise but both of them have to be
[1:34:20] enforced
[1:34:21] as the word is being preached to an
[1:34:23] unbeliever it is
[1:34:24] judgment is being enforced
[1:34:27] but to a believer is a promise fulfilled
[1:34:30] you receive
[1:34:31] that which you ask for two things right
[1:34:34] so
[1:34:35] now those things are being enforced by
[1:34:37] the presence by the spirit of god
[1:34:39] right he says here the prophet enforced
[1:34:41] then we
[1:34:42] are there we have the privilege to
[1:34:44] enforce to satan
[1:34:46] to tell him that satan will rebuke you
[1:34:49] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:34:51] get out by the authority
[1:34:54] given to me in the word of god we will
[1:34:57] compel you
[1:34:59] to get out it's not us
[1:35:02] that's what god said to enforce have you
[1:35:05] ever had the police officer saying uh
[1:35:07] i'm thinking that you're uh you must
[1:35:09] come over here
[1:35:10] i was just asking if you can put your
[1:35:12] hands like this
[1:35:14] so that i can arrest you because i
[1:35:16] you're going through the speed limit and
[1:35:17] the red robots
[1:35:18] traffic lights and i was just saying if
[1:35:20] it's okay with you
[1:35:22] can you just bring your head no no the
[1:35:23] traffic officer don't do that
[1:35:25] he's going to enforce the law if you
[1:35:27] don't he's gonna pull you with your belt
[1:35:30] huh that's how we must do to the devil
[1:35:33] and handcuff him
[1:35:34] and tell him you go in that cell
[1:35:38] okay he says yes you say yes
[1:35:41] okay we shouldn't be next in the devil
[1:35:44] and
[1:35:44] and not enforcing the word of god
[1:35:46] because we are making god a failure if
[1:35:48] we don't do that
[1:35:49] we are supposed to fearlessly do it
[1:35:52] be deaf we must be happy when he says
[1:35:56] i'll kill you say yes
[1:35:57] go on if you kill me you're actually
[1:36:00] been helping me
[1:36:04] you see the devil is the biggest loser
[1:36:07] if he kills you he's a loser if he
[1:36:10] leaves you
[1:36:10] he's a loser so what is it for me and
[1:36:14] you to fear
[1:36:15] why are we letting the world to toast us
[1:36:18] around as if we are not
[1:36:21] the bride of god we are called by such a
[1:36:24] name
[1:36:25] do you know a bright a bright stability
[1:36:28] can you remember the day you were
[1:36:29] wearing that dress
[1:36:31] every eye was on you my sister
[1:36:34] every eye of course
[1:36:38] because the christ his eyes cannot be
[1:36:40] looking at no no he's looking at his
[1:36:41] bride
[1:36:42] the focus of the lord now is on us
[1:36:45] it's not what he said about satan and
[1:36:48] the word he doesn't focus much on that
[1:36:50] his focus that's why we are called the
[1:36:52] apple of his eye
[1:36:54] or you say april here the april of his
[1:36:57] eye
[1:36:58] is you his main focus
[1:37:03] is you that's what the brother phil says
[1:37:05] right you are busy
[1:37:07] putting on your waiting garment white
[1:37:12] pure white have you ever seen anything
[1:37:14] whiter than the snow
[1:37:16] snow is the whitest thing that we know
[1:37:18] here on earth but
[1:37:20] our wedding gown the weight everywhere
[1:37:23] the weight ah that's what we are putting
[1:37:27] on now
[1:37:27] and if you are even finished
[1:37:31] right that's where the focus of the
[1:37:34] bridegroom
[1:37:35] is everything else we leave it in his
[1:37:37] hands
[1:37:38] we leave it in his hands in prayer i'm
[1:37:41] finishing now
[1:37:42] my time is done
[1:37:46] oops sorry my time is finished
[1:37:50] but uh just gone over one hour now
[1:37:53] so therefore oh sorry i want to read
[1:37:56] this portion for you it's a very nice
[1:37:58] piece
[1:37:59] that's like a dessert god has
[1:38:02] a law and his word is a law and a god
[1:38:06] is the god in this word made certain
[1:38:09] claims to check to the church
[1:38:11] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:38:14] flames upon satan
[1:38:16] a light and say give it back
[1:38:19] yes i've never i'd say i don't know
[1:38:22] you know give it back that's for the
[1:38:24] children when they play no give it back
[1:38:26] it's my no it's my noise
[1:38:27] no no you're not arguing like that give
[1:38:29] it back
[1:38:31] and he's gonna feel it when you punch
[1:38:33] him he's gonna feel that hey that was a
[1:38:35] punch man
[1:38:36] give it back you're not playing with him
[1:38:38] you're punching it
[1:38:40] with that statement give it back if he
[1:38:43] doesn't listen to you say in jesus name
[1:38:45] he just ran and he has to do it because
[1:38:50] we can take god's agent the holy spirit
[1:38:54] go right down on our knees and say it is
[1:38:57] that said the lord
[1:39:00] he's got to give it up that's all
[1:39:03] cause the holy spirit is there to make
[1:39:06] him to do it
[1:39:08] amen so there's no laws with us
[1:39:12] we are playing a game where we don't
[1:39:14] lose
[1:39:17] whether we've got the injuries whether
[1:39:19] some of our players are
[1:39:21] out whether the enemies call them
[1:39:23] massive numbers
[1:39:24] we don't know our part is not going to
[1:39:26] lose
[1:39:28] we are playing a winning game
[1:39:32] that's where we are and we leave we we
[1:39:34] move from that point of departure
[1:39:36] brother ben
[1:39:37] we are winning okay now come let's play
[1:39:39] we won
[1:39:40] come let's play but remember i won
[1:39:45] just don't forget that i won you want to
[1:39:48] play
[1:39:49] come on you're for anyone yes
[1:39:52] i'm for anyone and i'm going to beat you
[1:39:57] that's our rules of this game because
[1:40:01] our our husband has already won it
[1:40:04] the devil even got perplexed he said ah
[1:40:07] let me make some chick they stole him
[1:40:09] from the grave no they didn't steal him
[1:40:11] he knew that he rose
[1:40:15] it's the biggest propaganda machine the
[1:40:17] devil
[1:40:18] a biggest liar
[1:40:22] the law of the land is to enforce the
[1:40:24] policeman enforce
[1:40:26] the law when you see brother kubin says
[1:40:28] sit there don't sit there
[1:40:30] obey does his job as the policeman of
[1:40:33] the church
[1:40:34] don't take your personally no no no no
[1:40:36] no
[1:40:38] okay let me leave it there
[1:40:45] but the law of the spirit of god is to
[1:40:47] force satan to give up
[1:40:48] that which he unrightfully deceitfully
[1:40:51] taken from god
[1:40:53] souls of man he took from god souls of
[1:40:56] women
[1:40:56] children sickness of the body he placed
[1:40:59] upon people
[1:41:00] now where god made them in his image to
[1:41:03] be like him
[1:41:04] and the church is given rightful legal
[1:41:06] rights by the bible to take the holy
[1:41:08] spirit
[1:41:09] and force it upon him that is in this
[1:41:12] seminar you can go read this one

[1:42:39] yours
[1:42:40] what is mine right but
[1:42:43] with the power of god with your
[1:42:44] testimony that's
[1:42:46] how you overcome by the blood of the
[1:42:49] lamb
[1:42:50] and and your testimony tell the devil
[1:42:52] he's got no strings
[1:42:54] tied to you even if he can show you

[1:43:38] seven days just say praise the lord and
[1:43:40] he falls

[1:43:48] and believe it for real from the bottom
[1:43:50] of our heart
[1:43:51] the best prayer the best genuine prayer
[1:43:53] that you are going to do
