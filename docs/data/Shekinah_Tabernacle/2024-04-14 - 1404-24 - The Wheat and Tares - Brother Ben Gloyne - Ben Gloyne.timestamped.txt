[3:54] amen it's good to good to be
[3:57] here one day Bruce you be up here
[4:00] opening in
[4:01] [Music]
[4:11] prayer think
[4:13] [Music]
[4:16] about 11 12
[4:19] 13 years
[4:22] ago I gave Bruce a Bible and I said I
[4:25] think you you you're better off being a
[4:27] Christian and here's your Bible
[4:30] about 13 years ago you still got that
[4:32] Bible Bruce oh there it
[4:37] [Music]
[4:41] is you know some people just have a the
[4:44] the the sons of God just have a certain
[4:46] way about them they just they've just
[4:47] got a certain Spirit about them and you
[4:49] can kind of pick it up now and then you
[4:51] just pick it up you think there's I can
[4:53] sense a kindred spirit so it's something
[4:55] that I always sensed and Bruce amen
[4:58] let's um stand and let's opening the
[5:00] word of prayer I believe we're in for a
[5:01] good time this morning we're going to
[5:04] there's going to be a mighty outpouring
[5:05] of the spirit of God yes and each heart
[5:08] is going to receive it because we're all
[5:10] going to be open to the spirit of God
[5:11] and just be refreshed this
[5:14] morning amen you know we get what we
[5:16] expect and
[5:18] and you know it's possible that we could
[5:20] actually have the outpouring of the Holy
[5:22] Ghost and not receive any for ourselves
[5:23] if we don't open our heart and receive
[5:25] it you know we could it could be all
[5:26] around us but we don't receive it so
[5:28] let's not be that way this morning let's

[24:52] is and we want to believe that he's
[24:56] faithful
[24:58] but he's already told us he is so
[25:01] sometimes you sing because we are still
[25:04] believing and just claiming

[25:09] done it when we see it we don't see it
[25:11] he's still

[38:32] time so amen really enjoyed that amen
[38:35] let's um we're going to go
[38:38] to um I want to go to First Peter 3 and
[38:42] verse 1-4 um just this I'm not talking
[38:46] about dress well I'm talking about a
[38:49] greater dress wear of the Holy
[38:52] Ghost so I'm not talking about natural
[38:54] dress wear you read this some people go
[38:56] like this no don't I'm not talking about
[38:57] that I'm talking about a greater
[38:59] dressing greater adornment amen so he
[39:02] says here likewise you wives be in
[39:05] subject to your own husbands that if any
[39:08] obey not the word they also May without
[39:10] the word be won by the conversation of
[39:12] the wives while they behold your Chase
[39:15] conversation coupled with fear whose
[39:18] adoring let it not be that outward
[39:20] adoring uh adorning sorry of plating the
[39:23] hair and of wearing of gold or putting
[39:25] on of apparel but Let It Be The Hidden
[39:27] man of the heart and that which is not
[39:29] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[39:32] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[39:35] of God of great price if God puts a
[39:38] great price on something I think that's
[39:40] an important thing to possess amen so
[39:42] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[39:43] prayer this morning amen let's go before
[39:45] the throne of grace and prayer gracious
[39:47] Lord Jesus how thankful we are we can
[39:50] truly say from the bottom of our hearts
[39:51] there is none like you Lord we love you
[39:54] with all our hearts today we thank you
[39:56] we can be gathered this morning Under
[39:58] The Shadow of Your Great wings and we
[39:59] just want to ask that you would touch
[40:01] every life Lord Jesus may we leave these
[40:04] when when it's all said and done the
[40:05] final dismissal song is sung and all
[40:08] Lord we go to lunch or go our separate
[40:10] ways may we leave more like you change
[40:13] renew closer to you dear God may you
[40:15] grant it father we ask that you would
[40:17] take every Spirit under your control For
[40:19] Your Glory may you have the prence in
[40:22] our lives in this service we just want
[40:23] to commit Our Lives into your hands be
[40:25] with those who couldn't be here today be
[40:27] their portion Lord we thank you so much
[40:29] we can commit all things into your hands
[40:31] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen
[40:34] God bless you friends you can have your
[40:35] seats uh this morning so I want to talk
[40:38] about the want to keep this thought
[40:40] about the uh anointed bride body of
[40:42] Jesus Christ but I want to talk about
[40:43] what we're dressed in because I I
[40:46] honestly believe with all my heart if
[40:47] you could really see what God has
[40:49] dressed you in already that you're
[40:50] already if you have been filled with the
[40:51] Holy Ghost you're Rapture Ready amen
[40:53] you're ready to meet your king amen
[40:55] there's nothing that is out of you are
[40:57] ready amen it doesn't matter if you're
[40:59] asleep or awake or happy sad mad or glad
[41:02] amen when that moment comes to dead in
[41:04] Christ raise your body's going to be
[41:05] change so I think if we could look at
[41:07] life with such a confidence amen that
[41:09] God has made us ready amen I think I
[41:12] think we could just go rejoicing no
[41:13] matter what circumstance we're in
[41:15] whatever trouble's going on in life amen
[41:17] we can still lift up our heads and
[41:19] rejoice amen so you know it's amazing
[41:21] when you look at through the scripture I
[41:23] just wanted to start with this here
[41:25] about how how the um uh the Lord is
[41:28] saying this this adornment of a Meek and
[41:30] quiet spirit is a a a sight of uh in the
[41:33] sight of God is is of great price so so
[41:37] you know God is saying it's the inner
[41:38] man that matters you know sure what's on
[41:40] the inside manifest on the outside we
[41:42] know all those things but you know you
[41:44] can dress the part you can play the part
[41:46] you can say the right things but yet
[41:48] still be stuck on the Earth when the
[41:50] Rapture happens but if you truly know
[41:51] him amen you are ready so you know as it
[41:55] as it says in Revelations 19 and and
[41:58] from verse 6 I heard as it were the
[41:59] voice of of a great multitude as it was
[42:02] the voice of many Waters and as the
[42:04] voice of a mighty thundering saying
[42:05] Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[42:08] reth let us be glad and rejoice and give
[42:11] honor to him for the marriage of the
[42:12] Lamb has come and his wife had made
[42:14] herself ready and to her was granted
[42:17] this is how she made herself ready see
[42:19] the legalists want to say now what must
[42:20] I do well what's given to you to put on
[42:23] Amen which is the word of God Amen the
[42:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost and to her was
[42:26] granted
[42:27] that she should be ar raay and fine
[42:29] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[42:31] is the righteousness of saints and he
[42:33] saith unto me write blessed are they
[42:36] which are called unto the marriage
[42:37] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[42:39] these are the true sayings of God am
[42:42] mean so if you've been called to the
[42:43] marriage supper of the Lamb you're a
[42:45] blessed person amen today now through
[42:47] the scripture there's always been a
[42:49] change in clothing amen it's very
[42:53] important see when men fa and they you
[42:55] know you know they fail and they
[42:57] realized they were naked they tried to
[42:59] make some clothing they tried to make a
[43:01] dress in order to be presentable when
[43:04] God would come because they knew God
[43:05] came down every evening they had church
[43:07] every night God would come down in the
[43:09] cool of the evening and he would have
[43:10] fellowship with his with his children
[43:12] saying how wasn't in the Garden today
[43:14] and they' say father it was so wonderful
[43:16] and you know he would they would Express
[43:18] to him everything they did and you know
[43:19] all the fellowship they would have and
[43:21] but they came a a a different evening
[43:25] where instead of being being robed in
[43:27] eternal life amen they were found
[43:30] clothed in fig leaves because so man has
[43:33] always tried to dress themselves to come
[43:35] into the presence of God but as soon as
[43:37] the voice of God came walking through
[43:39] the garden they realized their dress
[43:41] wasn't going to cut it I mean it wasn't
[43:43] going to meet their needs and it's the
[43:45] same thing with religion friends see
[43:46] it's so important we come into the
[43:48] presence of God Amen where where if
[43:50] we're falling short God will show us
[43:53] amen we don't need to guess anything if
[43:54] we're really sincere and and and genuine
[43:56] before God God will show us things God
[43:58] will show us what we need to get rid of
[44:00] or or or lay his feet amen God will show
[44:02] us that we're ready amen God you know
[44:04] brings stability he brings you know
[44:06] peace into our hearts but you see they
[44:08] realized that they were not dressed
[44:10] right and so God had to dress them and
[44:13] the first account of an animal ever
[44:15] being slain was was God killing a lamb
[44:19] to to to clothe his children and God
[44:22] would God would wrap them in that
[44:23] Covenant amen and say I'm going to undo
[44:26] what has happened this say I'm going to
[44:28] dress you right one day Hallelujah and
[44:31] I'm so thankful we're not looking
[44:32] forward for this dress where to come
[44:34] it's here amen the bride has made
[44:35] herself ready amen by by by by being
[44:38] being robed in what they were robed in
[44:40] before they fell we're been robed in it
[44:42] amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[44:44] so God God is always you know we we need
[44:47] to be dressed right Hallelujah and he's
[44:50] given us the right clothing to be
[44:52] dressed in amen now Jesus would tell a
[44:56] parable Jesus would tell a parable of a
[44:58] king inviting people to a great wedding
[45:00] supper feast and there was a man who
[45:03] came to the feast and when the king came
[45:05] out he wasn't dressed right right now
[45:08] these are just the words um um Christine
[45:10] was in Switzerland many years ago and
[45:12] and and and the Lord inspired to speak
[45:13] this to one of her relatives because
[45:15] they saying they're a good person and
[45:17] the and and and the Lord said you cannot
[45:20] get into heaven through the window of
[45:22] your good works that's right right you
[45:25] cannot see see this man was dressed
[45:27] strong and when the king came out he
[45:29] said friend why are you here without a
[45:30] wedding garment and the Bible says he
[45:32] was speechless he had no answer he had
[45:34] no way to justify now on Earth everyone
[45:36] has a justification you know the people
[45:39] who are liberal will say well she'll be
[45:40] right God understands me I'll be refined
[45:43] his blood's more than sufficient but
[45:45] without letting it change their lives or
[45:47] the legalist will say well I've done
[45:49] this I do this right I say this I dress
[45:51] this way this is how things they're
[45:52] trying to get into heaven through the
[45:54] window of their good works and Friends
[45:56] you'll be disint pointed on that day if
[45:57] you're trying to earn something with God
[46:00] saying well I was raised in the message
[46:01] I believe the message you know the devil
[46:03] believes this message you know the Bible
[46:05] says you believe in one God you do well
[46:07] the devil also believes and trembles am
[46:10] mean so just saying having a profession
[46:12] of Faith ain't going to do it amen no
[46:14] what you believe must be manifested in
[46:16] you amen that's that's absolutely
[46:18] Paramount amen now I trust we're okay
[46:20] this morning but you see see we will not
[46:23] be if we are not if we don't go through
[46:26] the door of Jesus Christ will not be
[46:28] dressed right to meet the king amen but
[46:31] it's on this side we get dressed right
[46:34] amen God's prepared all things for us
[46:35] amen amen to to be ready see this man
[46:39] was not adorned right he wasn't dressed
[46:41] right and so when the king came he got
[46:43] Thrust out of the thrust out of the
[46:45] feast now see it was this man he was
[46:48] speechless he couldn't say nothing and
[46:49] he was the bridegroom ordered him to be
[46:51] bound and cast into outer Darkness but
[46:53] he had uh but he had got in there all
[46:55] right now what did that indicate either
[46:57] he might have come in a window or come
[46:59] in the back door or he had come through
[47:01] some other way besides the provided way
[47:03] and he was cast out and there is a
[47:05] provided way today and it isn't by our
[47:07] Creeds or by any other thing but by
[47:09] Jesus Christ he is the way and the man
[47:11] comes to God through Jesus Christ
[47:13] receives the Holy Ghost and is robed
[47:15] just like the rest of them that comes
[47:17] rich or poor made all made alike no one
[47:21] can enter in only by him praise the Lord
[47:25] I'm so glad he's provided dress wear
[47:27] amen for you and I this morning amen so
[47:30] this this scripture here where it says
[47:31] to be adorned with a Meek and a quiet
[47:35] Spirit now the word meek you many people
[47:38] especially in this day you know people
[47:39] want superheroes or a super church or a
[47:42] super leader or a super military or
[47:44] super everything's got to be super in
[47:46] this day can't be average can't be
[47:48] subpar it's got to be super super super
[47:51] and people view meekness as a
[47:54] weakness people misunderstand people
[47:56] think weakness is are just pushed around
[47:58] and you know you're just like a tumble
[48:00] weed just get pushed around no that's
[48:01] not real meekness meekness is really
[48:03] associated with with
[48:06] humility and humility is a is a um sadly
[48:09] a very forgotten thing in this day but
[48:12] the power of God comes by humility amen
[48:15] it doesn't come by pride pride or
[48:17] arrogancy or self-sufficiency it comes
[48:20] by humility so this so this uh Meek
[48:23] spirit is is of great price with God
[48:27] so you look at the Lord Jesus you know
[48:29] you the Prophecies of him coming you
[48:31] know he was you know Isaiah would see
[48:33] that every Mountain will be made low and
[48:35] every low Place made High and the you
[48:37] know Mountains will clap their hands and
[48:38] all you I mean the mountains will skip
[48:40] like Rams and the leaves will clap their
[48:41] hands and all these things so no doubt
[48:43] when I when when John the Baptist was
[48:45] standing there you know he was preaching
[48:47] that this Messiah is going to come he's
[48:49] going to thoroughly purges floor he's
[48:51] going to you you know you know fan away
[48:53] all the chaff and do incredible things
[48:55] and here came the Fulfillment of the of
[48:57] the prophecy a Meek humble lowly Man
[49:01] From Galilee amen if you never knew who
[49:03] he was I doubt he could yeah yeah I
[49:05] believe he could just walk through a
[49:06] crowd and people wouldn't know who he
[49:08] was he looked like everyone else he was
[49:11] you know you you he only had one change
[49:13] of garment or you I think he only had
[49:14] the one change he was wearing you know
[49:16] he wasn't wealthy no place to lay his
[49:18] head but yet amen he was a Creator
[49:21] himself he was God made flesh the one
[49:24] who spoke the world into existence the
[49:27] one who prophesied he would come the one
[49:28] who gave life the one who you know you
[49:31] made made a way back to back to himself
[49:34] the very God who made all things yet he
[49:37] came the most humblest lowly Meek way
[49:41] hallu amen and it bypassed it bypassed
[49:45] all the proud The Arrogant the people
[49:46] who thought they had it all together it
[49:48] bypassed all those what did you and he
[49:51] stooped yet he became the lowest but he
[49:53] still reached out in his hand for me
[49:56] Hallelujah
[49:57] Lord amen so what man calls great God
[50:00] calls foolish but what God calls great
[50:04] man calls foolish see we want to we want
[50:06] to have our mind the same as God's mind
[50:09] I mean we never want to step over
[50:10] greatness so you look at you know you
[50:12] know Christian I were talking about it
[50:13] the other day you know you know brother
[50:16] Brandon if he was alive today or we were
[50:18] back in his day and you didn't know who
[50:20] he was do you think he would tell you
[50:22] who he was I'm Malachi 4 I'm Elijah I'm
[50:26] I've got the Capstone revelation of the
[50:28] word you know I'm here to turn the
[50:30] hearts of the people back I've got this
[50:32] great ministry do you think he would
[50:33] have been boasting about those things
[50:35] sir no you would have had he you would
[50:37] have said he's a nice sweet humble guy
[50:39] amen friendly good to talk to but you
[50:42] see yet Prophet messenger for the age
[50:47] amen but yet lowly Kian you know humble
[50:50] man amen why because humility brings the
[50:54] power of God it's not how much we shout
[50:56] and dance and scream and things all
[50:58] those things are fine but if it's not
[51:00] with a humble heart it's just a bunch of
[51:03] noise amen I believe in noisy times
[51:05] absolutely but there's got to be
[51:06] humility which has got to underp it all
[51:08] amen that we've got to trust in God that
[51:11] God must do it amen you know humility is
[51:13] being able to surrender to the word of
[51:15] God Amen and really let him live so you
[51:18] see these things here so so to be quiet
[51:21] now many people maybe are reading this
[51:23] maybe thought well quiet just means you
[51:26] don't say that's not what it means you
[51:28] know it means keeping one seat so you're
[51:32] fixed I'm serving the lord I'm walking
[51:35] with God I'm here Lord fulfill your word
[51:37] in my life be glorified in my life Lord
[51:39] I'm a Christian on my worst day I'm a
[51:42] Christian on my best day I'm still a
[51:43] Christian the world is falling apart I'm
[51:45] still a Christian everything's all
[51:48] together I'm still a Christian amen this
[51:49] is the thing that I'm fixed on this is
[51:51] my seat at the table God has called me
[51:54] here I am amen and that come to me the
[51:57] Lord says I'll no wise cast out so Lord
[51:59] I'm on your hands I'm your problem Lord
[52:01] Jesus Hallelujah so that's really what
[52:04] it means amen see it's one that is
[52:05] undisturbed or
[52:07] undisturbed you see sometimes people
[52:10] have a lot of problems and the and the
[52:12] common denominator in their problems is
[52:15] them so sometimes we got to look at
[52:18] where the where the three other fingers
[52:20] are pointing and say maybe maybe I'm the
[52:24] I'm the common denominator in this equ
[52:27] maybe if it's if I go subtract me plus
[52:30] God then no
[52:33] problem there is not a math lesson but
[52:35] you know don't carry any fives just but
[52:37] but it's simple none of him sorry none
[52:40] of me and all of
[52:42] him amen that's how it should be so but
[52:44] you see some are very disturbing they
[52:46] cause trouble they C and and it's not
[52:48] good trouble doesn't stir up to good
[52:50] works it just destabilizes causes Strife
[52:53] in a bad way but you see those who are
[52:56] both amen you see we've got to have more
[52:59] than just the right
[53:01] doctrin amen if the devil told the truth
[53:04] he would say it's all true but he's not
[53:07] saved he's not born again that's why it
[53:09] says in Titus here not purloining but
[53:11] showing all good Fidelity that they may
[53:15] Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in
[53:17] all things for the grace of God that
[53:19] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[53:21] men so this doctrine's got to be adorned
[53:24] there's got to be a life that really
[53:25] proves you know you know when people see
[53:27] your life they should ask you well what
[53:28] do you believe what's different about
[53:31] you because they should be able to look
[53:32] Beyond maybe how you dress maybe how you
[53:35] talk and say there's something there
[53:37] there's something different in this
[53:38] person something different in this
[53:39] family and sure they say they're
[53:41] Christians but but what is it what
[53:42] denomination are you none I'm part of a
[53:45] kingdom I was born into a kingdom amen
[53:48] the kingdom of God Amen so so the
[53:50] doctrine of God must be
[53:52] adorned with a good character it's got
[53:55] to be adorned with a with a life that is
[53:57] not just not just saying one thing and
[53:59] doing the other that's a bad adornment
[54:02] amen a good adornment is a person who's
[54:03] a person of their word if they're wrong
[54:06] they're wrong if they made a mistake
[54:07] they say it if they've you know said one
[54:09] thing and they can't do it they'll say
[54:10] they can't do it you know who's with me
[54:12] today amen amen so this is this is how
[54:15] we must be to so so the doctrine of God
[54:18] must be adorned amen showing you know
[54:21] showing all good Fidelity now this word
[54:23] per purloining sorry if you don't mind
[54:25] all the uh definitions but it means to
[54:29] to set apart to divide to embezzle to to
[54:33] keep back now we don't want to be as
[54:37] Paul say don't be poining don't keep
[54:40] things back and what and and what does
[54:41] that really mean you know to separate
[54:43] for oneself or to embezzle withdraw
[54:45] covetly it's to you know to appropriate
[54:48] for one's own use what that really is is
[54:50] to do something and appear to be more
[54:52] spiritual than you really are that's
[54:54] really what pining is because because
[54:56] the only time this word poining is used
[54:59] in the scripture apart from there is in
[55:00] Acts chapter 5 where anas and Safara
[55:03] they sold their land and they but they
[55:05] only gave part of it to the disciples
[55:08] the bad thing wasn't that they kept part
[55:10] of it for themselves that wasn't the bad
[55:12] part the bad part was they secretly did
[55:14] it and and professed to the church we've
[55:17] we've sold it this is the entire price
[55:20] so they appeared to be more spiritual
[55:22] than they really were that was pining
[55:25] and we know what happened to them they
[55:27] ended it 6t under because they lied to
[55:29] the Holy Ghost so if they just said look
[55:31] we sold it for this much we were keeping
[55:33] this much for ourselves they wouldn't be
[55:34] no issue but they're appearing to be
[55:36] more see they're advertising that
[55:39] they're more spiritual than they really
[55:40] were look at this great big sacrifice we
[55:43] doing look at this big thing that I'm
[55:44] doing if that were just honest it would
[55:46] have been would not have been a problem
[55:49] am we don't want to be like that but you
[55:51] see those who are meek and humble they
[55:54] don't go advertise who they are they
[55:56] don't don't try and project what God has
[55:59] made them to be the life within them
[56:03] lives and proves itself hallelujah amen
[56:06] so we're called to change reignment
[56:08] we're all born in the wrong
[56:11] clothes I'm not talking about Nike
[56:13] edites whatever your brand is I'm not
[56:15] talking about that guy I'm talking about
[56:16] spiritual clothing we're all born in the
[56:18] wrong clothing right we needed to be
[56:21] because you know this this age God would
[56:23] say it's naked miserable rich and blind
[56:25] and don't know it
[56:26] now I've never seen in my life not that
[56:28] I've looked but I haven't seen someone
[56:30] who's naked and blind and think they're
[56:32] fine naturally you know even a blind man
[56:35] who's naked knows he's naked naturally
[56:37] but this world has got to such a
[56:39] condition that it doesn't realize that
[56:41] it's not dressed at all that's right you
[56:43] see and so we don't want to go along in
[56:46] life and just think everything's fine
[56:47] but are we clothed have we really met
[56:50] the Lord this is really the question
[56:52] have we really met him well I haven't
[56:54] had thunder lightning but as he changed
[56:55] your heart has God done a work have you
[56:57] seen you can look back in your life once
[56:59] I was a sinner I didn't care about
[57:01] nothing and I was trying to do all my
[57:02] Shady deals and whatever more and live
[57:04] you know just all kind of trouble going
[57:05] on but then one day he came and I
[57:08] surrendered my life and he became not my
[57:10] parents God no more he became my God and
[57:12] His word became everything to me amen so
[57:15] so that's how you know you've really put
[57:16] on some new
[57:18] clothes Hallelujah because it says here
[57:20] King James it says for as many of you
[57:22] has been baptized into Christ has put on
[57:24] Christ uh contemporary English version
[57:27] says and when you were baptized it was
[57:29] though you had put on Christ in the same
[57:30] way you put on new clothes Hallelujah
[57:33] and I'll say when you put on this robe
[57:35] you can't take it off and you're
[57:37] actually part of the clothes you can't
[57:38] see see you can see there's you can see
[57:40] where the shirt is and where my skin
[57:42] starts right but this robe you can't see
[57:45] there's no there's no Gap hallelujah
[57:48] hallelujah because you are part of the
[57:49] clothes you you begin to realize this
[57:51] word fits me just right amen this
[57:54] message fits me real good amen it's
[57:56] tailored and I've been shaped amen so it
[57:58] fits me real good like Elisha when he
[58:00] was called by Elijah you know Elijah
[58:03] threw his mantle upon him that's right
[58:05] it didn't fit him just right so what
[58:07] happened is Elisha followed Elijah till
[58:09] they came to the Jordan after I don't
[58:10] know how many years amen Elijah was
[58:12] taken up in a Rapture right that same
[58:14] robe fell upon Elisha Elisha put it on
[58:17] hey this fits different now yeah what
[58:19] not that the mantle had been changed to
[58:21] to to match Elisha no Elisha was changed
[58:24] to fit the mantle it's the same thing
[58:25] with the word of God we don't want to
[58:27] change the word of God to fit us oh no
[58:29] oh no a True Believer wants God change
[58:31] me if I've got to lose a few pounds Lord
[58:34] I'm going to lose a few pounds I got a
[58:35] few pounds of malice Strife Envy Pride
[58:39] you know whatever it is arrogancy
[58:40] bullying whatever it is in me Lord if
[58:42] I've got to shed those take it off oh
[58:44] God hallelujah and you know what's
[58:46] wonderful about it you don't have to
[58:47] jump on a treadmill you don't have to
[58:49] work it off there's a gospel you take
[58:52] amen and it just falls off amen am mean
[58:54] you repent give it to the Lord and
[58:56] you'll find it's gone Hallelujah then
[58:58] you can walk about how you should really
[59:00] walk about not encumbered by all those
[59:02] things trouble in your mind all the time
[59:04] Hallelujah so this is a different kind
[59:06] of a and then what did he say he said
[59:08] and then Elisha said now where is the
[59:10] god of Elijah he took that same mantle
[59:11] smoke the same river and the same things
[59:13] happen Hallelujah and you look at the
[59:15] church of you know of the Living God
[59:17] today amen the same things that Jesus
[59:19] did we do he does through US rather the
[59:22] same Miracles the same power why because
[59:24] he's the same godah
[59:27] now here's a question what's
[59:31] that is it wheat is it only
[59:36] wheat now you can see we can't really
[59:39] see it but there's some there's some
[59:41] weeds up here the green ones that's
[59:43] obviously weeds but are they the only
[59:45] weeds in that
[59:46] field no there's tears in that field do
[59:49] you know how you tell what a do you know
[59:52] do you know how they can tell what a
[59:53] tear is it's when they both become the
[59:56] corn and the wheat become mature guess
[59:58] one guess which one doesn't
[1:00:00] bow the tear doesn't bow you see they
[1:00:04] can look the same sure if you examine
[1:00:06] you know there's um seed labs and things
[1:00:08] that examine seeds and so on they can
[1:00:10] tell them but when it's growing you
[1:00:11] can't necessarily tell so these ones who
[1:00:13] are sticking
[1:00:15] up that ain't wheat the ones that are
[1:00:19] bowing that's wheat amen so what does
[1:00:22] that got to do with you and I
[1:00:24] well On's the bow are
[1:00:28] worshiping what and when you see someone
[1:00:30] worshiping where does the attention go
[1:00:32] not the worshipper but the object of
[1:00:34] worship Hallelujah you see so ones who
[1:00:36] are really bowing who are really wheat
[1:00:38] they've really got dressed right they're
[1:00:41] bowing that in their life you don't see
[1:00:43] them you see Christ you see the word put
[1:00:45] on flesh amen but the tear look at
[1:00:49] me come under my shadow how many times
[1:00:51] have we been troubled by Tears I'm
[1:00:53] talking about SP I'm not talking about
[1:00:55] serpent SE things necessarily today I'm
[1:00:57] talking about anointings amen where
[1:00:59] people see see all that field enjoys the
[1:01:01] same weather enjoys the same Sunshine
[1:01:04] enjoys the same meetings enjoys the same
[1:01:06] camp enjoys the same prayer meetings
[1:01:08] enjoys the same
[1:01:10] message both of them amen right but one
[1:01:13] is bowing one is
[1:01:17] standing right and then but then Jesus
[1:01:20] said of course wait till the Harvest
[1:01:21] time then a separation is going to take
[1:01:23] place now I'm not calling anyone a tear
[1:01:25] here okay let's just let's just get that
[1:01:26] across oh he's calling me a tear no
[1:01:29] we're born we're all born tears
[1:01:31] Hallelujah we needed a change of
[1:01:33] clothing amen because we're all born
[1:01:36] lost Judas was born lost Peter was born
[1:01:40] lost the only difference is one went to
[1:01:42] Pentecost and got a change of reignment
[1:01:45] Amen praise the Lord Lord amen you say
[1:01:48] well predestinated seed absolutely but
[1:01:50] you know there's got to be a
[1:01:51] manifestation of that but you know you
[1:01:53] see so so the ones that bow they're weat
[1:01:55] the ones that don't bow they are tears
[1:01:58] see this is why the tears are not
[1:02:00] humble they will not they want to be the
[1:02:03] object of worship they want to be the
[1:02:05] main main thing they want to be you like
[1:02:08] brother Brown would say you'd see
[1:02:09] advertisements for meetings and he asked
[1:02:11] God God are the people coming to see the
[1:02:12] man or you and even asked about his own
[1:02:15] Ministry in those same kind of ways are
[1:02:17] we here to worship a minister or we here
[1:02:18] to worship God are we here to worship
[1:02:21] you know man or The God man the Lord
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ you see so so if we are
[1:02:27] born if we have been born again truly
[1:02:30] born again yeah there ain't any
[1:02:33] tear there is no desire to be known
[1:02:37] there's no desire to be a main part in
[1:02:41] history the days of big Ministries are
[1:02:43] over it's now body work right it's a
[1:02:46] different season see there was Caleb and
[1:02:48] there was Joshua and sure they had their
[1:02:50] part and taking the promised land but
[1:02:51] there was many unseen ones that fought
[1:02:53] the battles and took their inheritance
[1:02:55] right and we're living in that season
[1:02:56] the previous season was fine but we're
[1:02:58] living in a different season amen where
[1:03:00] the whole body is now advancing amen
[1:03:03] growing amen because we know now that
[1:03:06] it's see if you have the Holy Ghost in
[1:03:09] you you'll believe God you'll love God
[1:03:11] act like a Christian that's right it
[1:03:12] isn't see if it isn't you know them by
[1:03:15] the fruits they Bear by the fruits they
[1:03:18] bear that's how you know them so we can
[1:03:20] look at this feel and say well the ones
[1:03:21] standing up they're not humble they're
[1:03:23] not Meek they're not lonely because
[1:03:25] remember if Christ the head was meek and
[1:03:27] lowly yeah how much more you and I amen
[1:03:30] how much more his body upon the Earth
[1:03:32] amen none of us should be stuffed shirts
[1:03:35] thinking we're
[1:03:36] something the only thing we can boast in
[1:03:38] is the Lord amen he's the worthy one
[1:03:41] he's the great one Among Us amen it's
[1:03:43] not it's not any other Ministry or not
[1:03:45] any Min not even a church it's him amen
[1:03:47] he's the important one he's the man of
[1:03:49] the hour he's the messenger of the hour
[1:03:52] brother Braham says the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:54] the prophet of the hour amen do we de
[1:03:56] deviate to something else no we stay
[1:03:57] with the word but he is the mighty one
[1:04:00] who are we going to worship on that
[1:04:01] wedding supper day
[1:04:03] him Hallelujah whose Throne are we
[1:04:05] dancing around him but you see the devil
[1:04:08] wants his own throne and he has it in
[1:04:09] this day and he cannot understand
[1:04:11] humility because he's not made to be
[1:04:13] humble he's not made to be meek he's not
[1:04:15] made to be lowly cuz he's proud and
[1:04:17] arrogant he's lifted himself up saying
[1:04:19] look how great I am look how great y
[1:04:21] people are people are so y The Cult of
[1:04:23] celebrity is so strong in this day
[1:04:25] people want to be a seley they want they
[1:04:27] want worship you look at the great
[1:04:29] artists of the day they are worshiped
[1:04:32] they are like deities in flesh people
[1:04:34] think you know and so what has happened
[1:04:37] is that luciferian Spirit has come down
[1:04:39] into humanity and it's fully expressing
[1:04:42] itself now if that's the case for the
[1:04:44] tears what about the wheat what about
[1:04:47] the wheat Hallelujah because many times
[1:04:49] we say well the well the tears are
[1:04:51] mature look at the world what about the
[1:04:53] bride what about you and I the person
[1:04:55] you're looking in the mirror you say

[1:05:07] Rapture happened in this moment you got

[1:05:14] Humanity was baked out of me the things

[1:05:47] yes he's bringing stability in my life
[1:05:49] yes the trouble seem less Troublesome
[1:05:51] cuz I realize the god that's with me is
[1:05:54] far greater than the trouble like like
[1:05:55] Elisha you know you know he was in Doan
[1:05:58] there you know in the city and then you
[1:05:59] know his servant you know gazi whoever
[1:06:01] it was brother brah says when to take
[1:06:03] the milk bottles out in the morning we
[1:06:04] don't do those things anymore but you
[1:06:06] know and then he panics because he sees
[1:06:08] the Assyrian army gathered around the
[1:06:09] city he says basically to Elisha we're
[1:06:11] toast we can't get out and you know
[1:06:14] Elijah just prays god open his
[1:06:17] eyes his prayer did not bring the angels
[1:06:20] of heaven down no his eyes just his
[1:06:23] prayer caused his eyes open to realize
[1:06:24] who was already there
[1:06:26] and if we could realize in another
[1:06:27] dimension the angels are here God is
[1:06:30] here not to condemn you but to say
[1:06:32] you're my child ien you're actually
[1:06:34] wheat in my field amen you're not a tear
[1:06:36] you're part of me amen this is why you

[1:06:40] feel or the way you think your desire is
[1:06:42] you want more of him why because you're
[1:06:44] part of him amen and when I see a field
[1:06:47] of tears and wheat I just see me as a
[1:06:49] wheat Hallelujah because when I realized
[1:06:51] God you found me you saved me you
[1:06:53] redeemed me I wasn't looking for you but
[1:06:55] are looking for me you found me you
[1:06:57] washed me you delivered me from many
[1:06:59] evil unclean spirits I realized Lord
[1:07:00] what else can I do but bow what else can
[1:07:02] I do I say thank you Jesus what else can
[1:07:04] I do but say Lord you are the worthy one
[1:07:07] amen cuz he has dressed us that when
[1:07:09] we'll see that great king we're going to
[1:07:11] go to the city that great king

[1:07:14] moment aren't you friends amen
[1:07:16] hallelujah hallelujah amen you see the
[1:07:19] gospel glows in humility and meekness
[1:07:22] and humbleness and power you're powerful
[1:07:25] people this morning I don't I don't know
[1:07:28] if you realize but you you're more
[1:07:30] powerful than all the armies combined in
[1:07:32] this world and in hell you're a very
[1:07:35] powerful person amen your prayers can
[1:07:37] turn this world upside down if God Leed
[1:07:39] you to pray that way amen if God Leed
[1:07:41] you to pray that way you could create
[1:07:42] your own private world go live on it
[1:07:44] with the power that's within you already
[1:07:46] amen you could do it if God LED you to
[1:07:48] do it hallelujah amen why because we are
[1:07:51] the redeemed bride body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:53] now I just want you to see this here
[1:07:55] that many times people take this word
[1:07:57] peculiar they think we're a strange
[1:08:00] people and in a sense we are to the
[1:08:02] world we're odd balls we are the rebels
[1:08:05] as brother Jimmy preached a few Sundays
[1:08:07] ago I mean we're Rebels against Babylon
[1:08:09] we are the quirky group but this word
[1:08:13] peculiar doesn't mean that way cuz
[1:08:15] people get on their mind or the devil
[1:08:16] gets it on their mind we're strange
[1:08:18] we're funny we're going to have to stick
[1:08:20] out like a sore thumb no the world
[1:08:22] sticks out like a sore thumb amen we are
[1:08:25] the only
[1:08:26] a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost has
[1:08:28] a sound
[1:08:30] mind amen we are see never put on your
[1:08:33] children that what there a burden you
[1:08:34] got to Bear you got to be this way and
[1:08:35] it's hard no there should be such a joy
[1:08:38] I get to serve God I get another day to
[1:08:40] be a Christian I get another day say
[1:08:42] thank you Jesus and pray and and walk
[1:08:44] with the Lord this is this is a glorious
[1:08:46] life amen hallelujah is it easy not
[1:08:50] always but it's glorious amen hallelujah
[1:08:53] you know what I mean so let's not look
[1:08:54] at the negative let's look at the
[1:08:55] positive I'm a I'm a seed in his field
[1:08:58] I'm a wheat am amen so this word
[1:09:01] peculiar it means an acquisition you're
[1:09:03] being acquired amen amen amen by
[1:09:07] extension sorry extension a preservation
[1:09:10] you're a preserved people amen you've
[1:09:12] been obtained amen you've been purchased
[1:09:16] you are possessed by the Lord Jesus
[1:09:18] Christ and you are saved Hallelujah I
[1:09:20] like that don't you amen so you're not
[1:09:22] just no you're not a funny people no no
[1:09:24] you're preserved Jesus Christ you're
[1:09:26] saved amen you're his possession
[1:09:28] Hallelujah that's a glorious thing I
[1:09:30] think amen hallelujah that he would call
[1:09:33] us in robust in his righteousness
[1:09:35] now Hallelujah so saying the gospel
[1:09:38] glows in humility meekness and
[1:09:39] humbleness and power amen while
[1:09:42] Hollywood shines and everything
[1:09:44] everybody Haring and hollering and going
[1:09:46] to it see we don't need that now he's
[1:09:48] not saying we we don't need a shouting
[1:09:50] noisy service he's not saying that but
[1:09:52] he's saying that you know just Haring
[1:09:54] and shouting and who's ever seen like
[1:09:57] well you all have Christian music in
[1:09:58] this
[1:09:59] day it's It's Entertainment it's not
[1:10:03] worship easy contemporary what even
[1:10:06] oldfashioned stuff it's it's a worship
[1:10:08] of the Artist as opposed to a worship of
[1:10:11] God you see and that's why it says
[1:10:13] Hollywood shines that shines that's
[1:10:16] shiny false gold shines real gold glows
[1:10:20] amen F's gold is iron pyate there's no
[1:10:23] gold in
[1:10:24] it right we don't want to be fools gold
[1:10:27] we want to have the real gold that
[1:10:30] shines of deity of the Holy Ghost within
[1:10:32] us amen so the gospel
[1:10:36] glows there's a warmth that's with it
[1:10:38] there's a love that goes out there's a
[1:10:39] humility there's a you know there's a
[1:10:41] joy there's a presence there's a

[1:11:59] she is ordained not to fall Hallelujah
[1:12:03] that's incredible thing you say God's

[1:12:06] to change you need to put on some
[1:12:08] spiritual glasses amen he's kept you

[1:12:19] is the way you should go I mean you've
[1:12:21] been preserved and kept in many
[1:12:23] different ways and I believe that when
[1:12:25] we get to the other side there's going
[1:12:26] to be uh well there's going to be
[1:12:28] Hallelujah and glories then when God
[1:12:30] really unfolds what he kept us from it's

[1:13:12] a meekness and a humility amen
[1:13:14] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's
[1:13:17] not not not not self advertisement not
[1:13:19] China because remember these signs shall
[1:13:22] follow them that believe Amen to the
[1:13:24] life of the wheat the signs follow that
[1:13:27] life it's very different you take David
[1:13:30] and Saul signs LED Saul Samuel said to
[1:13:33] him you find the donkeys here you go to
[1:13:35] these prophets you'll prophesy with them
[1:13:37] this will happen here this will happen
[1:13:38] here signs LED Saul yeah signs follow
[1:13:41] David amen David got anointed by by by
[1:13:44] the same Prophet then he killed the lion
[1:13:47] he killed the bear he killed Goliath
[1:13:48] amen why signs were following his life
[1:13:51] when he went to the battle with Goliath
[1:13:53] he wasn't looking for a fight that day
[1:13:54] his dad just said take this food to your
[1:13:56] brothers amen he was serving in his
[1:13:58] family living maybe another kind of a
[1:14:00] day but yet God anointed him Amen in his
[1:14:02] everyday life and he down that giant and
[1:14:04] they had a great Victory what signs
[1:14:06] followed David amen that's why the wheat
[1:14:09] doesn't look for all these signs no the
[1:14:10] still small voice of God leads the wheat
[1:14:13] amen we don't need to try and work out
[1:14:14] things and sure it's nice to see
[1:14:16] rainbows and number plates and all these
[1:14:17] things but no it should be the word of
[1:14:18] God leading you amen not all these
[1:14:21] different signs because Saul failed amen
[1:14:23] cuz what he was led by signs amen no
[1:14:26] David the signs followed David amen this
[1:14:30] is why this we got to realize we have
[1:14:32] authority to cast out Devils I mean
[1:14:35] there's no Spirit we should be afraid of
[1:14:38] Amen we shouldn't be troubled by nothing
[1:14:40] the devil try and intimidate you and
[1:14:41] push it in your face now you can stand
[1:14:43] flat footed say my God is my strength
[1:14:46] devil you've got an expiry date you've
[1:14:48] come to the wrong house you've come to
[1:14:50] the wrong life you've come to the wrong
[1:14:51] mind you're going to get a
[1:14:53] beating Hallelujah
[1:14:55] this is because we're endued with power
[1:14:57] from on high am mean we're not some weak
[1:14:59] see the devil wants you to think that
[1:15:01] your weapon is equivalent to his weapon
[1:15:04] last time I read the book of Revelation
[1:15:05] he still got a bow no arrows he's
[1:15:08] nothing but a bluff he can intimidate
[1:15:10] how like who's read I think it's even in
[1:15:12] the Ukraine war now but especially World
[1:15:14] War II they would make fake planes and
[1:15:17] fake tanks that the Germans or the
[1:15:19] Allies will come and they drop their
[1:15:20] bombs on these fake tanks and planes and
[1:15:23] they think man we just destroyed an air
[1:15:25] field it was a bunch of fake stuff and I
[1:15:27] think it's the same thing today what
[1:15:29] it's but it looks probably from the sky
[1:15:30] it looks intimidating look at all these
[1:15:32] weapons where' they get all these tanks
[1:15:34] from well they just got some 4X tws went
[1:15:36] to M 10 they made a
[1:15:38] tank and it's the same thing with the
[1:15:40] devil it can look so real but it's just
[1:15:42] a bit of 4X two I mean there's no
[1:15:45] gunpowder there's no missiles there's no
[1:15:46] armor there's nothing in it it's nothing
[1:15:48] but a bluff but if you're bluffed by his
[1:15:51] bluff then his bluff works sometimes I
[1:15:52] think he says oh I can't believe that
[1:15:54] one worked
[1:15:55] yeah right but if we really test what he
[1:15:58] has you'll see it's just wood amen so
[1:16:01] when the Devil comes in and you put it
[1:16:03] to the test say no my God said this the
[1:16:05] word says this it is written you're
[1:16:08] putting his bluff to a test and you'll
[1:16:10] find it's nothing but a bluff remember
[1:16:12] Satan has to move yes amen he has to
[1:16:15] move we cannot just put up with him we
[1:16:17] cannot just say well this is how life is
[1:16:19] going to be this is how they're going to
[1:16:20] be this is how I am forget it amen Peter
[1:16:24] thought he was a fisherman he wasn't a
[1:16:25] fisherman he was an apostle he was a
[1:16:27] fisher of men amen all the disciples
[1:16:30] Paul thought he was a Pharisee how wrong
[1:16:33] was that guy he was real wrong he
[1:16:36] realized he was wearing the wrong dress
[1:16:38] though the wrong clothes when he met the
[1:16:39] Lord on the road to Damascus but
[1:16:41] sometimes we think well this is just how
[1:16:43] life has to be they probably thought
[1:16:44] that too how wrong were
[1:16:46] they amen so we should never back up to
[1:16:49] the devil we should never put up with
[1:16:50] him never tolerate him say Satan you're
[1:16:52] going to move in the name of Jesus
[1:16:54] Christ you're going to get out this is
[1:16:56] this trial has an End Amen this is not
[1:16:59] how it has to be amen are you with me
[1:17:01] today
[1:17:02] hallelujah amen cuz these signs shall
[1:17:05] follow them that believe amen we are God
[1:17:09] Has Lifted us up above the
[1:17:12] enemy but it isn't strange when you
[1:17:14] think about that we have the answer to
[1:17:16] the world's
[1:17:17] problems we have we have what the world
[1:17:20] needs amen right but yet if the world
[1:17:25] had what we have do you think I think
[1:17:26] they would act quite differently well
[1:17:28] actually they wouldn't cuz they' be
[1:17:29] changed like us but what I'm trying to
[1:17:30] say is if they had the same product
[1:17:33] imagine if some pharmaceutical company
[1:17:35] had a serum that made eternal
[1:17:37] life that would be advertised
[1:17:40] everywhere right but it wouldn't be with
[1:17:43] meekness or
[1:17:45] humility amen because we know what we
[1:17:47] car in our hearts right but Lord lead us
[1:17:52] to share it with others Lord create an
[1:17:54] opening that I can speak and if I've
[1:17:57] said too much pride me that I'll stop
[1:18:01] right why
[1:18:03] because we greatness is humility don't
[1:18:07] forget that church greatness is
[1:18:08] expressed in humility not how fine you
[1:18:11] can be he says I don't mean dirty I
[1:18:14] don't but I mean humble and spirit see I
[1:18:16] don't mean just go out and don't ever
[1:18:18] wash and clean up uh that you should do
[1:18:20] that you know that see but I'm talking
[1:18:22] about humility genuine humility not
[1:18:24] something is put on something that is
[1:18:26] its real
[1:18:28] humility amen this is see greatness is
[1:18:32] humility Jesus the greatest man to ever
[1:18:34] walk the earth didn't even have a peer
[1:18:37] he is
[1:18:38] unmatchable but yet meek and
[1:18:41] lowly and yet he'd stand there at
[1:18:43] lazarus's grave and say I am the
[1:18:45] resurrection and the life Hallelujah and
[1:18:48] he didn't just say it he proved it yes
[1:18:50] amen it's the same thing with the bride
[1:18:51] we don't just say it we God proves it in
[1:18:53] our lives amen amen there's not just a
[1:18:56] advertising or a words it happens amen
[1:18:59] amen glory to God hallelujah that's
[1:19:03] right am mean you see brother Bram says
[1:19:05] he's been in the company of Great Men
[1:19:08] who think they're great yeah who who who
[1:19:11] who wear all the finest clothes Drive
[1:19:13] the nicest cars all these things they
[1:19:15] think they're great but but they great
[1:19:17] men who are really great make the other
[1:19:19] person feel they're great so a great
[1:19:22] person isn't the amount of money in the
[1:19:24] bank account whatever they have stature
[1:19:26] whatever no it's not that great people
[1:19:28] make other people feel great that's
[1:19:31] right Hallelujah so if you want to see
[1:19:33] someone who's truly humble a truly great
[1:19:35] person they should make you feel great
[1:19:38] amen now that's just not pouring on
[1:19:40] empty compliments no there should be an
[1:19:43] atmosphere around them how they talk to
[1:19:45] you putting you above them amen should
[1:19:49] it should make you feel great
[1:19:51] amen but you see we must have with with
[1:19:54] with humility true humility brings the
[1:19:56] right attitude true humility brings the
[1:19:59] right attitude you
[1:20:02] see someone who is legal or liberal you
[1:20:06] know that person's that way because
[1:20:07] they're annoyed at the
[1:20:08] other if someone's legal they're
[1:20:11] anointed a liberal person if someone's
[1:20:13] liberal they get annointed a legal
[1:20:14] person but if you have genuine humility
[1:20:16] you're clothed with the Holy Ghost you
[1:20:18] love everybody amen you love everybody
[1:20:21] right you may see them that way listen
[1:20:23] liberalism legalism they are both
[1:20:25] ditches on the side of the road it's
[1:20:26] time to get out of the trench Walk The
[1:20:29] King's Highway amen amen who hey if that
[1:20:31] person's doing that that person is doing
[1:20:33] that love them the same remember we were
[1:20:36] unlovable once but God found us he loved
[1:20:39] the unlovable I was unlovable this Bible
[1:20:42] says I was his enemy and he died for me
[1:20:45] amen so we should never if we're truly
[1:20:47] humble say Lord you loved me when I was
[1:20:49] unlovable surely I can love someone else
[1:20:51] the same way amen so we should never
[1:20:54] ever have the wrong attitude that's amen
[1:20:57] praise the Lord because you can never
[1:20:59] cast a devil out by the wrong
[1:21:01] attitude you can never do it doesn't
[1:21:04] matter how much you think you know how
[1:21:06] much you do know if you've got the wrong
[1:21:08] attitude if you're annoyed at that
[1:21:09] person see this is so to me this is so
[1:21:12] astounding you never cast out a devil by
[1:21:13] the wrong attitude it takes love to do
[1:21:15] that and love is the most powerful force
[1:21:17] there is in the world now if you notice
[1:21:19] a devil is always hate hate is of the
[1:21:22] devil and then and when people hate
[1:21:24] someone remember it's a terrible devil
[1:21:26] to despise or dislike you mustn't do
[1:21:31] that Amen to me that there is like a
[1:21:35] yeah if you despise or dislike someone
[1:21:38] yeah that's a terrible demon influencing
[1:21:41] your life so we should never dislike
[1:21:43] anyone oh they did this to me they did
[1:21:45] that to me when Jesus was on Calvary he
[1:21:48] had no ought he had no anger he had no
[1:21:51] resentment the very ones who put him on
[1:21:53] the cross was spitting on him making fun
[1:21:54] of him he said father forgive them they
[1:21:56] don't know what they do I mean they
[1:21:58] looked beyond he looked beyond he looked
[1:22:01] beyond what they were doing and said
[1:22:03] father forgive them the lordu he didn't
[1:22:06] despise them he didn't dislike them he
[1:22:08] loved them this is this is our King and
[1:22:12] we're part of him are are we not amen
[1:22:16] amen and I you I know I've said it
[1:22:18] before but it's a you know it's a
[1:22:19] strange thing when he said they don't
[1:22:21] know what they do because they planned
[1:22:22] it yeah yeah humanly they knew knew what
[1:22:24] they were doing but God looked
[1:22:26] beyond cuz like the Apostle Paul summed
[1:22:28] it up if they really knew he W who he
[1:22:30] was they would never have crucified the
[1:22:32] Prince of Life so we should never
[1:22:34] despise it's a terrible devil to despise
[1:22:36] or dislike we should just love everybody
[1:22:39] if you just if you despise anyone
[1:22:40] dislike and say Lord take me to Calvary
[1:22:42] again take it from me Lord I want to
[1:22:44] have love for my enemies love for my
[1:22:46] friends love for everyone no matter what
[1:22:48] they've done am mean I want the right
[1:22:50] attitude towards everyone that Lord in
[1:22:52] your in your timing if there's something
[1:22:55] wrong if if there's a spirit there or
[1:22:56] something Lord you can anoint me to cast
[1:22:58] it out
[1:22:58] Lord hallelujah just like I said about
[1:23:02] that teenage girl on the Solomon Island
[1:23:03] screaming her name was Satan and
[1:23:05] thrashing about and all those things and
[1:23:07] I was asking God God what can I do and
[1:23:10] then this love and compassion came over
[1:23:12] me for her cuz I realized she's just
[1:23:13] another Soul like me my Lord Jesus died
[1:23:16] for her too she you know we have the
[1:23:18] same category and then I prayed for then
[1:23:21] that thing left amen what it's love that
[1:23:24] does it amen it's not how much you shout
[1:23:26] not how much you scream you see brother
[1:23:28] BR on the platform people come up before
[1:23:31] him he he just speaks he says Satan now
[1:23:33] you leave Satan the angel of the Lord
[1:23:36] commissioned me in a cave to say if you
[1:23:37] can get the people to believe me amen
[1:23:40] then then nothing can stand before my
[1:23:41] prayers I believe the people believe now
[1:23:43] get out amen and those things left you
[1:23:47] see why it was love and compassion I
[1:23:49] said God give us a good dose of love and
[1:23:52] compassion Lord in this Dying World this
[1:23:53] world that's hard and polarized and you
[1:23:56] know this world is building up am me to
[1:23:58] to tear itself apart in the Great
[1:24:00] Tribulation you see all the resentment
[1:24:02] past hurts and pains and strife between
[1:24:04] peoples and Nations it's simmering it's
[1:24:07] simmering that's why the world's so
[1:24:08] fragmented there's hatred between groups
[1:24:10] and everything because when the Holy
[1:24:12] Ghost leaves those things will just
[1:24:13] burst out and it's going to be a chaos
[1:24:16] of a world with the nations are split
[1:24:19] nations are divided you think there's
[1:24:20] going to be civil war everywhere it'll
[1:24:22] be World War II is and amateur
[1:24:24] tribulation compared to what's coming
[1:24:25] upon the Earth but you see it's bubbling
[1:24:27] up bubbling up bubbling up people hatred
[1:24:30] everything online polarized this group
[1:24:32] and that group you're not for us you're
[1:24:33] against us all these things and it's
[1:24:35] going to burst open amen don't be caught
[1:24:37] up in nothing political don't be caught
[1:24:39] up in nothing that's going on in this
[1:24:40] world you stay with the Holy Ghost you
[1:24:42] stay with the love of God whatever you
[1:24:44] do because if you're caught up in those
[1:24:45] things amen you'll be dragged into the
[1:24:47] tribulation but if you walk with this
[1:24:49] word you go up into glory amen so don't
[1:24:51] dislike these things that engineered to
[1:24:53] dis make you dislike someone well those
[1:24:56] people are my people I've been oppressed
[1:24:57] they've been oppressed those things may
[1:24:59] all be true but don't be caught up in it
[1:25:01] you stand in the middle say no there's a
[1:25:03] better way Brethren the love of God is
[1:25:06] the way amen he's the only one that can
[1:25:08] men this world the Prince of Peace is
[1:25:10] what this world needs amen it's not
[1:25:12] trying to write wrongs and whatever more
[1:25:14] yeah that's right amen no amen see the
[1:25:18] Jews back before Titus butchered
[1:25:20] Jerusalem you go read about that that
[1:25:22] was a horrible thing that happened there
[1:25:23] but you see imagine being a believer in
[1:25:26] those days being a Jewish believer and
[1:25:29] there's a big because it a it a
[1:25:30] political religious move to get rid of
[1:25:33] Rome yes and then now you've got a next
[1:25:35] door neighbor he doesn't see like you
[1:25:36] see he hasn't had a Pentecost like
[1:25:38] you've had he still believes in the
[1:25:40] blood of bulls and goats but yet you
[1:25:41] still get along or maybe he's even a
[1:25:43] Christian but he hasn't got the Holy
[1:25:44] Ghost yet and he goes to a political
[1:25:46] religious rally Rabbi Sono preached to
[1:25:49] us the other night we're going to get
[1:25:51] rid of these Romans we're going to we're
[1:25:53] going to our faith is going to bring the
[1:25:55] Messiah down because when we kick him
[1:25:57] out and purify the temple he's going to
[1:25:58] come to his Temple twisting the word and
[1:26:01] then but but we look at him say no
[1:26:03] that's not right that's right say what
[1:26:05] do you mean it's not right you're a Jew
[1:26:07] I'm a Jew we're in the same tribe you
[1:26:10] should stand with us what a Temptation
[1:26:13] look what the Romans did to your family
[1:26:14] look what they did to your brother look
[1:26:15] what they did to your uncle look what
[1:26:16] they've done to us as a nation you must
[1:26:18] stand with us yeah what a pressure yeah
[1:26:21] but you see that man who's got the Holy
[1:26:23] Ghost would say no I love the
[1:26:26] Romans how can you love them they're
[1:26:29] murderers they're brutal they're
[1:26:30] barbaric look what they've done to us
[1:26:32] we're going to Revenge we're going to
[1:26:33] get our Vengeance on them no but the
[1:26:35] love of God is controlling see his life
[1:26:38] is a worship it's not a tear sticking up
[1:26:41] saying we're going to do this no it's a
[1:26:43] surrendered life am me his life is
[1:26:45] reflecting of the one who redeemed him
[1:26:48] so then when Titus besieged the city the
[1:26:51] first time they lifted The Siege that
[1:26:53] man ran for the hills cuz he knew the
[1:26:55] prophecy of Jesus had to be fulfilled
[1:26:57] yeah you see but then when Titus came
[1:26:59] the third time no one escaped that's
[1:27:02] right it was a they were
[1:27:05] butchered that is going to happen on the
[1:27:07] World level yes yes they got caught in
[1:27:11] the city because they were caught up in
[1:27:12] a religious political move
[1:27:14] amen don't be caught up in that stuff
[1:27:17] don't be caught up in that stuff our
[1:27:19] lord Jesus was was rejected in this age
[1:27:23] right that's why the world's gone into a
[1:27:25] chaos walk out with him walk with him
[1:27:29] don't worry about anything else going on
[1:27:30] in the world social media is designed to
[1:27:33] divide right it's it's designed to
[1:27:37] divide you scroll for an hour what do
[1:27:39] you get out of
[1:27:40] it why do it I realized the other day
[1:27:44] Facebook's boring social media is
[1:27:46] actually boring why do you go on YouTube
[1:27:48] I list say that'll bless me
[1:27:50] am I'm looking for things to bless me
[1:27:53] I'm not looking for things to fill my
[1:27:54] time that's right amen you see so
[1:27:56] there's a reason it's not just stay away
[1:27:58] from it like a no legalist no stay with
[1:28:01] the word Spirits travel on those things
[1:28:04] to get your attention to put you into a
[1:28:06] false
[1:28:07] reality amen amen amen people want to
[1:28:11] live in a false reality why don't we
[1:28:12] live in the real one why don't we live
[1:28:14] in the one where there's a real God
[1:28:16] there's a real heaven we're going to
[1:28:18] there's a real wedding supper we're
[1:28:19] going to enjoy and we have all that and
[1:28:22] we can walk with God on this side amen
[1:28:24] we can see his word be fulfilled we can
[1:28:26] see his power see his glory be in his
[1:28:28] presence hallelujah hallelujah amen we
[1:28:32] don't just have some dead religion we
[1:28:34] have a living God Amen who really does
[1:28:37] save and redeem hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:40] thank you Lord Amen brother I know put
[1:28:42] this up on his WhatsApp I thought that
[1:28:44] is brilliant love makes you do things
[1:28:48] and when the church gets the real love
[1:28:49] of God in their heart they'll do things
[1:28:51] they won't be ashamed oh Christ don't
[1:28:53] want you to be it isn't so much to be
[1:28:55] loyal he doesn't want your patronage he
[1:28:58] wants your fellowship that's what God
[1:29:00] wants is to have fellowship with you so
[1:29:03] people say well I'm loyal to the word
[1:29:05] and I'm standing true for the word
[1:29:07] that's all fine but if there's no love
[1:29:09] in there it's just going through a form
[1:29:11] right or patronage I pay my ti I come to
[1:29:13] church all those things are fine but
[1:29:15] without the real love of God motivating
[1:29:17] you you see someone who has the real
[1:29:19] love of God to me that's the third PLL
[1:29:22] right someone who really takes the whole
[1:29:24] word of God and they genuinely love the
[1:29:26] Lord that is the third po of
[1:29:28] manifestation because brother Braham the
[1:29:30] angel the Lord told Brother Bram the
[1:29:32] third pole cannot be
[1:29:33] impersonated see you people can try and
[1:29:35] impersonate saying well I keep the word
[1:29:37] I believe everything all these things
[1:29:39] but without the love of God in their
[1:29:41] souls to motivate them it's just an
[1:29:44] impersonation yeah that's right
[1:29:47] right so to me this is the third pull
[1:29:49] you really love the Lord with all your
[1:29:51] heart well brother said well it's not
[1:29:52] love no but there's love in
[1:29:55] it what's your what's your motivating
[1:29:57] factor yeah Lord you called me I want to
[1:30:00] you want to walk with me I want to walk
[1:30:01] with you I want to have fellowship with
[1:30:03] you Lord amen I'm in your field your sun
[1:30:06] is shining upon me amen I want to you've
[1:30:09] robed me in your righteousness now let's
[1:30:10] walk together amen see God could not
[1:30:13] walk with Adam and Eve with a fig Leaf
[1:30:15] garment that's right he dressed them to
[1:30:17] walk with
[1:30:18] them hallelujah what about in this day
[1:30:21] we're not we are robed in
[1:30:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:30:27] hallelujah
[1:30:29] hallelujah amen let's
[1:30:32] just let's just go back to let's just go
[1:30:34] back to this shall we we'll

[1:30:51] but you're not a tear you may be having
[1:30:53] a lot of trouble in your life but you're
[1:30:54] not a tear amen you're a wheat amen

[1:31:03] Pentecost there was the there was the uh
[1:31:05] Feast of the first fruits where the you
[1:31:07] know where where the mature part of the
[1:31:09] field will be cut down a section of it
[1:31:11] and the priest would be given it and
[1:31:13] it'll be waved before the Lord and
[1:31:14] they'll be thanking God the rest of the
[1:31:16] field is going to come into the same
[1:31:18] maturity right because grain natural
[1:31:21] natural uh fruit and everything grain it
[1:31:23] matures at different levels it's not one
[1:31:25] day it's green next day it's all golden
[1:31:28] some parts are more gold than the others
[1:31:29] but it's all as long as that life is
[1:31:30] there it's growing up right so now now

[1:32:13] see yourself in the whole Bible amen but
[1:32:16] he says this look he was plucked up from
[1:32:17] the earth and is waved over the people

[1:32:22] quickening power of the first one

[1:32:29] fruit of them that slept he was waved
[1:32:31] over the promised seed that had promise
[1:32:34] of life amen so you were lying in the
[1:32:37] field one day but you had a promise of
[1:32:39] life thank you Lord hallelujah you had
[1:32:42] promise of life God wanted to fellowship
