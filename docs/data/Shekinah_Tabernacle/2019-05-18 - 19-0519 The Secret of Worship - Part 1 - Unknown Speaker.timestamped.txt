[59:44] that's just toilet paper money that's
[59:46] worth about two cents is enough to get
[59:50] you a drink of water
[59:52] brother you decided that he would
[59:53] utilize this resource and who tight
[1:00:18] brother age is gearing up for a fiery
[1:00:22] study so this church was the first place
[1:00:26] we went to brother Kwan
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:42] well I think it's quite
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:02:04] so that we went to another church and
[1:02:07] dom lasses a Baptist denomination and
[1:02:09] this is the first time they ever heard
[1:02:11] the message so we had one service and I
[1:02:13] got him brother Adrian got me to
[1:02:15] ministered here and share my testimony
[1:02:18] was received quite well
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:03:05] God's love is so great he will reach
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:04:01] he said this church this is the most of
[1:04:05] the church there quite a small Church in
[1:04:07] the middle just above Saigon down the
[1:04:09] south of Vietnam very nice people first
[1:04:12] time that ever heard anything more than
[1:04:13] Baptists theology so they were quiet
[1:04:15] they were quite blown away actually and
[1:04:18] they invited us back so yeah pray for
[1:04:20] these fellows I can't remember the guys
[1:04:21] name but he's actually from Indonesia
[1:04:23] the pastor there but they're quite open
[1:04:26] and so yeah just thank the Lord for that
[1:04:28] opportunity it was just that came up the
[1:04:30] guy in the midle beer with the white
[1:04:32] suit their brother Duong this brother
[1:04:36] here he he'd got us into there that's my
[1:04:39] translator fook and this was the pastor
[1:04:42] vir it's hard to see everybody but um
[1:04:46] yeah that was it went quite well and
[1:04:49] they felt connected to that with the
[1:04:53] whole thought was to connect this
[1:04:55] minister to the apostolic ministry and
[1:04:59] ye+ to get invited back you know so the
[1:05:02] Lord really undertook it was quite
[1:05:03] amazing it's hard to tell when you're
[1:05:06] not there but the atmosphere is
[1:05:07] different because they are not used to
[1:05:10] that type of preaching and they are used
[1:05:13] to a lecture you know they're used to a
[1:05:15] fable they're used to just you know
[1:05:17] laying out facts and putting things
[1:05:19] together and how good you should live
[1:05:21] and what sort of stuff so when they
[1:05:22] heard this it was all new for them but
[1:05:25] it was done in a simple way that they
[1:05:26] could they could understand it and that
[1:05:28] Minister could go man there's something
[1:05:30] more in the Bible you know
[1:05:31] amen as they're gonna continue on rifice
[1:05:33] top that by okay you can so now this is
[1:05:37] brother Adrian here we went to church
[1:05:42] and we spent three days with these guys
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:35] brother Adrian was quiet he didn't
[1:06:38] really like having all these people
[1:06:39] sitting on his bed the Lord knows how to
[1:06:44] deal in our lives
[1:06:45] I didn't really mind I was quite funny
[1:06:52] actually but now we had a really good
[1:06:55] time of these with three days about six
[1:06:58] meetings a day with these guys as David
[1:07:01] Fuchs Church and there they to place the
[1:07:04] Ministry of Elijah in Scripture and to
[1:07:07] see themselves in the scripture
[1:07:09] now we're riding out to the mountains
[1:07:11] we've now traveled up tune our trend
[1:07:13] which is about 8 10 hours north of
[1:07:17] Saigon and we're going up into the
[1:07:18] absolute remotest places in Vietnam up
[1:07:22] into the mountains it costs too much to
[1:07:25] get a Texan 45 degrees Bobo's too
[1:07:52] this is the only church fully
[1:07:54] established and like getting established
[1:07:56] in the message now in Vietnam so we had
[1:08:00] a wonderful time this is ministers two
[1:08:38] days of ministers needs and in a day of
[1:08:40] the whole church
[1:08:42] it's the pastor brother Bobo very
[1:08:52] powerful atmosphere was in these places
[1:08:55] really
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:01] so these guys are just coming into the
[1:09:03] third pool now just just like just walk
[1:09:07] again it's quite amazing they're having
[1:09:10] an awakening this brother here while
[1:09:15] while he was hearing the word he had a
[1:09:18] transformation in the Lord showed him
[1:09:19] that he was a caterpillar and he turned
[1:09:21] into a butterfly to fall like new
[1:09:23] birthright on the service his name as
[1:09:25] brother Jean but there was others as
[1:09:28] well but we didn't get to this was the
[1:09:30] only one he was one of the ministers
[1:09:32] that was there for the three days all
[1:09:33] the heaps of things happened in the
[1:09:35] service while we were preaching quite
[1:09:41] quite an outpouring of the Spirit
[1:09:43] actually happened in the service for all
[1:09:45] of the congregation as well and they are
[1:09:47] seeps of questions and things just the
[1:09:49] Lord really moved that was like their
[1:09:51] season now to come up another higher
[1:09:53] another level and come come right into
[1:09:56] the message right into the fullness of
[1:09:58] the word and come into that bedroom
[1:10:00] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:02] you know their intimacy was into the
[1:10:04] third Paul the tenth so yeah you can
[1:10:07] carry on now yes he testified he just
[1:10:14] had an absolute amazing awakening right
[1:10:16] in the service real nice brother
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:23] there are many people trying to be
[1:11:26] Christians
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:52] here's a great outpouring of the Spirit
[1:12:55] the whole church just raised up and was
[1:12:56] screaming out to God they just they were
[1:12:59] calling for the fullness of God in the
[1:13:02] new birth many things happened in that
[1:13:05] place very lovely people very simple
[1:13:07] people we've never been able to but
[1:13:09] that's the first time they've actually
[1:13:11] heard third pole preaching so it's
[1:13:13] always been very elementary just you
[1:13:16] know the fundamental foundations but
[1:13:19] finally they had actually grew into the
[1:13:21] position where they could hear the word
[1:13:23] now we're in Quan Chi 12 hours a normal
[1:13:26] of not ring this is a group of ministers
[1:13:36] like our fellowship the ministers and
[1:13:40] that's David he's blind he's our
[1:13:44] translator these guys hear a lot of
[1:13:51] stuff went down in Quang I that I got
[1:13:54] you guys to pray about and now the whole
[1:13:56] church they were too scared to tell us
[1:13:58] that they were they were already
[1:14:00] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but
[1:14:01] the Lord ordered that so that because I
[1:14:04] sensed and was directed that fear was on
[1:14:08] them so I was preaching against fear and
[1:14:10] separating from the Babylonian spirit
[1:14:13] and coming into under the headship of
[1:14:15] Christ and they got very strong
[1:14:18] evangelism basically and the church
[1:14:22] basically they were too scared to tell
[1:14:24] us that they were already baptized in
[1:14:27] the name of Jesus Christ because they
[1:14:28] thought our translator David was not
[1:14:30] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:14:32] if they said anything he was going to
[1:14:33] tell the superiors of the denomination
[1:14:36] in the area and so they were too scared
[1:14:38] to confess so it was fear that they
[1:14:40] didn't want to lose their job you know
[1:14:41] so yeah what happened was we just felt
[1:14:45] led of the Spirit to say an issue want
[1:14:48] to get baptized three baptized don't
[1:14:50] come to the next service don't come back
[1:14:52] and this you want to be baptized because
[1:14:54] we had been there for so long their
[1:14:55] years and trying to they're not telling
[1:14:57] us that they've already been baptized
[1:14:59] and they just don't want to take that
[1:15:00] step it was like what are we doing they
[1:15:02] don't want to get baptized they've heard
[1:15:03] all those preaching and Skype studies
[1:15:05] and everything
[1:15:05] they're not taking that step but I
[1:15:07] always knew that it was fear fear was
[1:15:10] holding them back as I was preaching a
[1:15:13] preaching case fear and brother Adrian
[1:15:14] was preaching about you know the event
[1:15:18] just pure evangelism around the same
[1:15:20] thoughts and they have what heaven was
[1:15:24] because they ultimatum pushed them into
[1:15:26] a corner and they loved the word they
[1:15:28] loved studying with us they love hearing
[1:15:30] it there but there was what they got
[1:15:32] squeezed into a corner and then one of
[1:15:36] the guys gave me a message he says we do
[1:15:38] believe baptism in Jesus name and I was
[1:15:40] like what does this mean why are they
[1:15:42] saying so I text another brother in the
[1:15:45] area choir and he he I see there's this
[1:15:49] like a cello fellowship are they
[1:15:50] baptized in the name of Jesus cry and he
[1:15:53] sent me a picture of them all being
[1:15:54] baptized and about three or to two or
[1:15:57] three years ago or something and and and
[1:16:01] and so David the translator rings the
[1:16:03] muffin says are you already baptized
[1:16:06] what's going on a seesaw yeah we were
[1:16:10] because you know I was baptized Oh what
[1:16:13] so you were baptized too but they said
[1:16:15] we didn't want to say anything because
[1:16:17] we thought you were would tell on us you
[1:16:18] know so the Lord removed that spirit of
[1:16:22] fear and opened up the channel now and
[1:16:24] now they want their half of their church
[1:16:26] rebaptised
[1:16:27] because there's only half of the church
[1:16:28] got baptized rebaptised now they want
[1:16:30] the other half done when we go back
[1:16:32] there and we've got two weeks of
[1:16:35] meetings of another Bible school there
[1:16:37] to go through in time prophecy and
[1:16:41] David's church the blind brother that
[1:16:44] translates for us he there's a move
[1:16:48] happening in his church too and they're
[1:16:49] they're wanting to start Skype studies
[1:16:51] and wanting because they didn't they
[1:16:52] weren't really interested and now they
[1:16:54] are and they starting to do tape
[1:16:56] meetings with the message and things
[1:16:58] like that as well to bring them up
[1:17:00] because there just hasn't been any
[1:17:01] movement so quo and I as these things
[1:17:04] happening there now which we actually
[1:17:06] went in there we thought we were going
[1:17:07] to leave and not come back you know like
[1:17:09] it's just not happening there and
[1:17:10] something's blocked there or whatever
[1:17:12] we've been pray for it but then all of a
[1:17:14] sudden right at the end because of these
[1:17:15] turns of events and the Lord moving in a
[1:17:18] certain way it opened up
[1:17:19] vision and all of a sudden everything
[1:17:21] opened there it was like a demon lift
[1:17:23] that was holding them all down and a
[1:17:25] sphere and it just lifted off them and
[1:17:27] then there was actual dialogue and you
[1:17:30] could talk to them and they weren't
[1:17:31] scared it was amazing so yeah and then
[1:17:35] at the end of our trip we went up to
[1:17:38] Hanoi and we met sister cherry who's our
[1:17:41] translator and this was the most random
[1:17:45] you wouldn't believe scenario that we
[1:17:49] can't put into here this guy here he
[1:17:52] invited us for meetings because has has
[1:17:54] his second wife he's got two living
[1:17:57] wives and he's married to both of them
[1:17:59] his second wife she's a Christian and
[1:18:01] his first wife as a Muslim and so he
[1:18:04] we're at his Buddhist wife's place and
[1:18:06] hid but we met him down in Saigon with
[1:18:10] his Christian wife and that we had
[1:18:13] served with Malaysians had many services
[1:18:15] there and and and he would always just
[1:18:17] kind of sit around at the back so he was
[1:18:20] there and he come he we have we carry
[1:18:23] their waste think we're gonna have
[1:18:23] meetings he's going to invite people and
[1:18:25] whatever I don't know what's gonna
[1:18:26] happen but then we set the air we him
[1:18:27] and we just sit down and we and and we
[1:18:30] find out that he's got two wives and
[1:18:32] he's smoking like a bong the Lord just
[1:18:36] puts you in these random situations you
[1:18:38] like what do you do you can't just
[1:18:40] preach to these fellows you know because
[1:18:42] they're not even ready to hear what are
[1:18:45] you gonna say so
[1:18:46] we're like oh man we can't even start we
[1:18:48] were going we're gonna have to go before
[1:18:49] Genesis you know right to the beginning
[1:18:52] of everything and start from the
[1:18:53] beginning so we we we brother Adrian
[1:18:57] started just speaking to him and then it
[1:18:59] came to came out that he's not actually
[1:19:01] ready to become a Christian you know
[1:19:03] it's not really he likes Christianity
[1:19:05] listens to sermons and things like that
[1:19:08] and he reads the Bible sometimes but
[1:19:10] he's not really to give us heart
[1:19:11] completely to the Lord and that's
[1:19:12] basically where the preaching boredom so
[1:19:15] we thought what what are we doing here
[1:19:17] and then his first wife she grabs a
[1:19:22] chicken and it's squawking and whatever
[1:19:24] she just bashes it on the head cuts its
[1:19:26] head off and pulls all the feathers out
[1:19:28] starts making us lunch you know just
[1:19:30] dices the whole thing up you know the
[1:19:32] whole bird
[1:19:33] throws it in the soup but the Lord kind
[1:19:43] of impressed on us you know just let him
[1:19:45] do it let him bless the bride let him
[1:19:49] bless her let him bless you and so we
[1:19:51] had they made us a feast and we had
[1:19:53] lunch and then we just said was the
[1:19:55] later and so yeah but then we spent we
[1:20:01] had a very powerful time in henan we
[1:20:03] actually we been a lot of had a bit of
[1:20:05] fellowship was just the cherry and it
[1:20:06] was a nice time and then brother agent
[1:20:09] and myself we spent a lot of time and in
[1:20:13] fellowship and in the presence of the
[1:20:15] Lord and some amazing things have opened
[1:20:18] up in the word and also it's just that
[1:20:22] that's that's an experience it's a
[1:20:24] circumstance that you you just never
[1:20:26] really get into you know like to be
[1:20:29] caught up in such an atmosphere without
[1:20:32] any distractions where anything it was
[1:20:34] like it was just ordered of the Lord to
[1:20:36] come into the place and of you know
[1:20:41] being completely separated unto the Lord
[1:20:44] on the backside of the desert you could
[1:20:47] say which was in the middle of Hannah we
[1:20:49] in this lake here it's like this is the
[1:20:52] central center of Hanoi Isaac would love
[1:20:55] the city center it's the perfect city
[1:20:57] center it's got it's got about a four
[1:20:59] column at a walk right around this lake
[1:21:01] and then on the other side of that is
[1:21:03] just all the shops right around it and
[1:21:05] they had this big festival here oh my
[1:21:09] goodness that was yeah just absolutely
[1:21:13] crazy but this whole place was just full
[1:21:15] of people riding around this lake just
[1:21:17] walking around so we'd walk around the
[1:21:18] lake and then one guy started talking to
[1:21:20] us so I shared the gospel with him and
[1:21:22] he was pretty interested so I just told
[1:21:24] him what to do and and if the Lord you
[1:21:26] know oh you can just stop that now just
[1:21:29] lifted in the Lord's hands really open
[1:21:31] I've got his number but I must have
[1:21:33] taken it down wrong so yeah I can't even
[1:21:35] remember the guys name and then another
[1:21:38] person came up we made a few people and
[1:21:40] started witnessing for different people
[1:21:42] and just made ourselves available for
[1:21:44] the Lord so yeah that's that
[1:21:46] the Lord's done many things lots of
[1:21:49] lives would change things were
[1:21:50] established

[1:22:16] first partaker of the fruits and so I
[1:22:18] believe the Lord allowed me to
[1:22:20] experience this and such a way to
[1:22:24] partake of the fruit that I'm about to
[1:22:26] speak to you about and I just trust the
[1:22:29] Lord will lead us and he will inspire us

[1:22:40] word amen amen

[1:23:01] spirit and in truth for the father

[1:26:06] amen I want to speak on the secret of
[1:26:09] worship part 1 so I don't know how far
[1:26:12] we'll get is there a clock somewhere
[1:26:16] mate this is not okay I thought there
[1:26:20] was a clock in here somewhere there was
[1:26:22] a clock out the array Oh mate we're
[1:26:27] going out of time into eternity then
[1:26:30] [Laughter]
[1:26:31] yeah amen
[1:26:33] but the hour cometh and now is when
[1:26:36] remember he now is right there but
[1:26:40] remember the church kind of went away
[1:26:41] and did its thing and the devil came in
[1:26:43] and he tried to take over everything and
[1:26:45] tried to starve out the truth try to get
[1:26:47] rid of all of those things but then God
[1:26:48] said I will restore so let me declare to
[1:26:51] you that the hour that he's speaking of
[1:26:53] now is again amen that's been restored
[1:26:56] we are right here right in the same
[1:26:58] thing right again amen and God is here
[1:27:02] lives are going to be changed this
[1:27:03] morning amen hello you just let him deal
[1:27:07] with you let him have his way Hey just
[1:27:12] open your heart open the aperture right
[1:27:14] up you know when you eyes go into the
[1:27:16] dark they adjust and the pupils go right
[1:27:18] open you know and they take in as much
[1:27:20] light as possible because there's not
[1:27:21] much light well there's a lot of light
[1:27:23] in this place right now and I want your
[1:27:25] heart to do what your pupils do amen and
[1:27:28] open right up and let the Lord deal amen
[1:27:32] don't reason don't dodge just receive
[1:27:34] Amen hallelujah because the Lord can
[1:27:37] work the Lord can deal to align us to
[1:27:41] align us because we think we're
[1:27:43] something no I don't mean about pride or
[1:27:45] anything we think we're a certain thing
[1:27:47] and we're we're thus invest and whatever
[1:27:49] and we behave that way and we live that
[1:27:52] way and we act that way and react that
[1:27:54] way and everything seems to be that way
[1:27:55] but it's not really who you really are
[1:27:57] amen you are an eternal being that was
[1:28:01] never beginning and it's that you start
[1:28:03] in the mind of God
[1:28:05] amen and that being has a certain
[1:28:08] culture a certain behavior a certain
[1:28:09] temperament a certain reaction to the
[1:28:12] word hallelujah because in eternity you
[1:28:15] reacted in a certain way to the Word of
[1:28:17] God hallelujah your thoughts were in the
[1:28:20] complete synchronization with the
[1:28:22] thoughts of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[1:28:25] because the bride and the bridegroom is
[1:28:28] the same Prophet declared she is him
[1:28:32] Amen hallelujah so I believe I'm looking
[1:28:36] at true worshipers that are on a journey
[1:28:38] that started in the mind of God and it's
[1:28:41] being expressed in mortal bodies for the
[1:28:43] purpose of redemption amen for the
[1:28:45] purpose to start in a certain condition
[1:28:48] crushed down by the the laws of man and
[1:28:50] under the depressions of this world and
[1:28:53] uncultured in a certain way by all the
[1:28:55] pressures of society but then God would
[1:28:58] come down with an open book to start
[1:29:00] speaking to you who you really are and
[1:29:02] if you open your heart and let him do he
[1:29:04] will actually bring you up and you will
[1:29:07] start to become just like you were
[1:29:08] before the world even began amen and and
[1:29:13] really you know we're going to be caught
[1:29:15] up in the secret of worship when I say
[1:29:18] the secret of worship this is a place
[1:29:20] that people we can all enter in the
[1:29:23] blood paid the way amen
[1:29:25] the Lord paid it in full there is no
[1:29:28] reason why we cannot be caught up into
[1:29:31] the Shekinah glory amen
[1:29:33] there's a difference now this - there's
[1:29:36] probably more but I'm going to two
[1:29:37] things right so one sometimes the glory
[1:29:42] of God just falls on the surface and
[1:29:43] everybody's affected amen and then other
[1:29:47] times there's just a few people that are
[1:29:49] affected by that glory because they are
[1:29:51] going into the glory that's been opened
[1:29:54] for them and the veils been rent and
[1:29:56] they're going in what others sit there
[1:29:58] like this and they're wondering why are
[1:30:00] they what's going on here I'm not
[1:30:03] feeling like that why is it why am I not
[1:30:05] feeling like that one person is starting
[1:30:07] to realign with their eternal image one
[1:30:10] person realizes they've got access
[1:30:12] hallelujah
[1:30:13] they got access and they can get that
[1:30:16] access anytime they want hallelujah amen
[1:30:19] and as we grow and as this identity is
[1:30:22] given as it unfolds to us and we open up
[1:30:25] and we allow it to affect us we allow
[1:30:27] the power of the thought to come into
[1:30:29] our lives the power of that thought to
[1:30:33] come down and start changing things amen
[1:30:36] these people start coming up into that
[1:30:38] place and you know someone might just
[1:30:41] say Jesus and all of a sudden power of
[1:30:44] God brings it personally a man like that
[1:30:46] guy that was you know stomping in the
[1:30:49] Attic hallelujah I like that story he
[1:30:52] just read a geography book come on
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:30:56] hallelujah just a geography book he was
[1:30:59] so into missus theophany hallelujah just
[1:31:05] to see how you know come on
[1:31:07] honestly hallelujah bless man there was
[1:31:12] nothing between him and her Savior
[1:31:14] hallelujah there was no cultural
[1:31:17] limitation no military way hallelu you
[1:31:20] know so many of us many of us have been
[1:31:24] been oppressed under military standards
[1:31:27] being oppressed under military
[1:31:29] upbringing or most of us because most of
[1:31:34] our parents were drafted for the wars
[1:31:35] and we've been through those things and
[1:31:37] they they got a certain leadership
[1:31:40] mentality impressed upon them and then
[1:31:43] they just did that to us it's how they
[1:31:46] did it to us but that's not like they're
[1:31:48] in the kingdom of God that military way
[1:31:51] that stalwart way is not the way of the
[1:31:54] kingdom of God when it comes to worship
[1:31:57] when it comes to connecting with our
[1:31:59] eternal nature hallelujah no we're under
[1:32:04] a restoration and so we're all in a
[1:32:07] different place we've all got different
[1:32:08] personalities we've all got different
[1:32:11] cultural inhibitions limitations and
[1:32:15] expressions and benefits the right word
[1:32:19] we'll just use benefits but the officer
[1:32:22] to limitation freedoms amen
[1:32:26] and some of them are good and some of
[1:32:27] them are not good but remember us we all
[1:32:29] come from an eternal culture we all come
[1:32:34] from a divine expression hallelujah the
[1:32:39] Lord took the bride out of the
[1:32:41] bridegroom on the cross because he
[1:32:43] wanted a lady to react to him he wanted
[1:32:48] some joy in the service he wanted when
[1:32:51] his word would be preached there would
[1:32:53] be joy coming back they would be
[1:32:56] rejoicing they would be shouting the
[1:32:59] oldest religion in the world is a
[1:33:02] shouting religion Amen I'm feeling it
[1:33:05] all over me it's a shouting religion
[1:33:08] amen / oh yeah Amen I'm gonna get ahead
[1:33:13] of myself but all the sons of God not
[1:33:16] some of them not most of them all the
[1:33:20] sons of God shouted for joy amen amen
[1:33:24] you know it and so when you become
[1:33:29] aligned to that image again you will
[1:33:31] shout for joy hallelujah it's a shouting
[1:33:36] message what did the Lord to send down
[1:33:39] to do he descended with a shout teaming
[1:33:43] and feet so that was a divine expression
[1:33:47] he descended with a shout and he's
[1:33:51] expecting one back he's expecting a
[1:33:55] appropriate reaction to that shelf
[1:34:00] hallelujah hallelujah okay let's go
[1:34:05] amen oh my lord of seeking that he's
[1:34:10] seeking such worshipers and spirit and
[1:34:15] enjoy people that have the money in the
[1:34:19] bank and can write the check
[1:34:21] amen hallelujah many times people can
[1:34:24] write the chick got no money or people
[1:34:26] go here some money and no no ability to
[1:34:28] write the check but the profits it all
[1:34:30] if we could only just unite those two
[1:34:32] forces we could only not unite these two
[1:34:37] realities
[1:34:39] we would see some good things going on
[1:34:42] hallelujah God seek her such to worship
[1:34:44] Him amen God is a spirit and they that
[1:34:47] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[1:34:48] and in truth now remember this there is
[1:34:52] a mandate on the devil the devil's got a
[1:34:55] word spoken over him that limits him
[1:34:59] from hurting the oil in the wine so
[1:35:02] you've got oil and you've got wine
[1:35:05] because our God came down in the evening
[1:35:07] time in the wedding time and he turned
[1:35:09] the water into wine in your life and
[1:35:11] he's turning water into wine right now
[1:35:13] if you open up the aperture if you open
[1:35:17] it up and allow him he will turn the
[1:35:19] water that's coming out of this mouth
[1:35:20] into one and I'm not just talking about
[1:35:24] some cheap wine from the bottom shelf
[1:35:26] hallelujah I'm talking about the best
[1:35:29] wine hallelujah
[1:35:31] now that wine is what's going to get you
[1:35:33] shouting me men their wines going to
[1:35:35] change your behavior that one's going to
[1:35:37] change your outlook and life then one's
[1:35:39] gonna change the way you speak you're
[1:35:41] gonna speak the truth hallelujah amen
[1:35:44] you stop behaving yourself unseemly or
[1:35:46] self style disappears all of those
[1:35:48] things then haven't you all gone
[1:35:52] hellooo you hurt not the oil and wine
[1:35:55] Satan that's what he says hurt not the
[1:35:59] oil and the wine amen because my Brides
[1:36:03] gonna come back to her image she's going
[1:36:05] to express she's going to react
[1:36:08] appropriately to the expression she's
[1:36:12] going to be in perfect harmony oh my and
[1:36:16] she's on her Road amen we're all gone
[1:36:21] that road and we may resist we may think
[1:36:23] no that's not me I'm this we may think
[1:36:27] no I've never done that so I'm never
[1:36:28] gonna do it but God has got a different
[1:36:30] idea hallelujah amen and there's a power
[1:36:33] in this room to raise you out
[1:36:35] oh yeah you know one day I'm going to
[1:36:39] the end of the sermon now one day
[1:36:43] someone's going to preach your rapture
[1:36:45] hallelujah hallelujah one day that words
[1:36:49] gonna become flesh hallelujah amen are
[1:36:54] you gonna start walking like Enoch came
[1:36:56] in when the Spirit of the Lord comes
[1:36:58] upon my heart I will walk like Enoch
[1:37:02] whoa hallelujah amen
[1:37:06] someone's gonna preach then unless
[1:37:07] you're gonna react in the same way it
[1:37:09] was preached you will react and the same
[1:37:13] spirit the same calibre hallelujah the
[1:37:17] same caliber of the expression of the
[1:37:22] rapture because the rapture comes from
[1:37:24] the thoughts of God the rapture comes
[1:37:26] from the mind of God and eternal reality
[1:37:29] and he in his mind when he thought of
[1:37:32] the rapture he was thinking of you
[1:37:35] because you are the rapture amen but
[1:37:39] he's just waiting waiting for people to
[1:37:43] get out of themselves to go beyond the
[1:37:45] camp of their own and inhibitions
[1:37:46] to go beyond the camp of what they think
[1:37:49] they are and start looking into the
[1:37:52] third call start going into the tenth
[1:37:54] version start spending time in the
[1:37:56] Shekinah hallelujah and let him lead
[1:38:00] hallelujah amen because that wraps are
[1:38:03] going to be preached and then is going
[1:38:05] to be a reaction brother Branham says
[1:38:13] fundamental doesn't mean too much it's
[1:38:17] the revelation of God amen
[1:38:20] it's a powerful quote it's very short
[1:38:23] but I thought well it was a lot more
[1:38:26] around it but I thought well this is
[1:38:27] just what I wanted to share their
[1:38:32] fundamental does not mean too much it's
[1:38:34] the revelation of God you can't do it on
[1:38:37] a halfway profession you can't do it on
[1:38:40] a knitted mind how many missing minds

[1:43:46] is a reality hallelujah don't dodge the
[1:43:49] bullets don't dodge them whoever you may

[1:44:13] I'll send you the invoice every divine
[1:44:20] expression has an appropriate reaction
[1:44:24] the level of your reaction to that
[1:44:28] divine expression depends on your
[1:44:30] spiritual condition that's right amen
[1:44:35] and it will get so strong that gravity
[1:44:40] will not hold you on that seat when you
[1:44:43] get caught up in the power of their

[1:45:01] you'll be like Jeremiah's burning in my
[1:45:03] bones Lord
[1:45:05] hallelujah because the divine expression
[1:45:08] is coming forth and it's expressing to
[1:45:10] you oh my and it gives so much when your
[1:45:14] thoughts come into that caliber with
[1:45:17] your thoughts go beyond reasoning when
[1:45:19] you receive this word straight into the
[1:45:22] heart
[1:45:22] oh my you're not afraid of nothing being
[1:45:27] a man because you've been sealed we've
[1:45:32] come in by the new and living way home
[1:45:34] and not a new and religious way not a
[1:45:37] new and boring way Amen but a new and
[1:45:39] living way hallelujah
[1:45:41] oh my there's a change in dispensation
[1:45:44] Saints hello Mary just you know she went
[1:45:47] to determine she thought she was going
[1:45:48] to see the mercy seat between the
[1:45:50] cherubim still like the Old Testament
[1:45:52] but she turned around and she saw a
[1:45:54] person she saw the mercy seat standing
[1:45:57] in front of because the mercy seat is
[1:46:00] not a shadow anymore hallelujah oh my
[1:46:04] the person amen let me just teach this
[1:46:12] some hindrances to the secret of worship
[1:46:15] you none of us none of us can dodge this
[1:46:19] not even me
[1:46:20] none of us we're all in this together we
[1:46:23] all have this flesh and we all have come
[1:46:26] up under some sort of a restricting
[1:46:28] culture but I just I I just encourage
[1:46:35] forget the culture forget what other
[1:46:38] people think and what you think other
[1:46:40] people think and don't behave because
[1:46:43] other people behave a certain way you
[1:46:44] live before an audience of life where
[1:46:49] these are some of the hindrances it's
[1:46:51] probably lots more but we're or what our
[1:46:54] affections are acclimatized and the
[1:46:59] Bible says set your affections on things
[1:47:01] above yeah and then because your I did
[1:47:04] and your life is hid with Christ in well
[1:47:06] not on things that the earth is the
[1:47:09] purpose for that we nice you might need
[1:47:12] to go do things but it might not be
[1:47:13] going through your affections channel
[1:47:15] what you let into your affections
[1:47:18] channel
[1:47:19] entertainment games all those things as
[1:47:22] soon as you have an element of joy on
[1:47:26] something that is not of God you're
[1:47:29] leading that spirit right and just like
[1:47:32] when you are sitting here and you've got
[1:47:35] joy right now anyone that's got joy
[1:47:37] right now because of the word is getting
[1:47:39] the power of that word and one day those
[1:47:42] inhibitions that are holding you on your
[1:47:44] seat and making you quiet will be broken
[1:47:47] hallelujah Amen when this whole church
[1:47:52] is shouting every person they'll be back
[1:47:55] in the image of what it was an eternity
[1:47:58] when the victory is preached now there
[1:48:02] may be some sadness preached there may
[1:48:04] be some conviction Proops I don't think
[1:48:06] they'll be shouting because it's not
[1:48:08] appropriate that's why the balance is
[1:48:10] there there's a balance you know I think
[1:48:14] there are probably you know there are
[1:48:16] some churches that are very very
[1:48:18] exuberant and no matter what the
[1:48:21] preacher says they're just up in there
[1:48:22] shouting and doing their thing even if
[1:48:24] it's they're getting preached at and
[1:48:25] they're getting convicted and whatever
[1:48:27] it's just the mentality or a culture or
[1:48:30] whatever but there's an appropriate
[1:48:32] reaction to every divine exception and
[1:48:36] the level of your reaction depends on
[1:48:39] your spiritual condition honestly
[1:48:42] because the thought is more powerful
[1:48:45] than your old culture
[1:48:46] the thought is of Gardner before of God
[1:48:48] is more powerful anything you can hold
[1:48:53] back knows nothing can hold back amen no
[1:48:57] Roman power no Romans seals no stones in
[1:49:00] front of tombs no grave clothes of
[1:49:02] Lazarus no nothing hold back our power
[1:49:05] when the resurrection comes forth oh ma
[1:49:07] Oh hallelujah
[1:49:10] did you know that you house oh oh oh oh
[1:49:18] lord help me
[1:49:26] be careful you may be sitting here going
[1:49:30] I don't know what this is all about I
[1:49:32] understand this preaching and it's good
[1:49:34] but where are your affections what have
[1:49:37] you enjoyed lately
[1:49:40] what entertainment has gone into your
[1:49:42] spirit and soiled what entertainment
[1:49:48] what are you attuned to you know when
[1:49:51] you turn the receiver and you tune into
[1:49:53] something you know we've got a receiver
[1:49:55] in here the wise virgin has a receptacle
[1:49:58] Oh hallelujah
[1:50:00] the foolish version doesn't have the
[1:50:02] receptacle but the wires version has a
[1:50:04] receptacle to receive oil a man to
[1:50:08] receive oil now that don't tune to these
[1:50:15] other things and affections and all
[1:50:16] those others you know hey maybe you're
[1:50:19] not gonna get in trouble for it but you
[1:50:21] will have trouble for because reason we
[1:50:27] live as - you know let's just generalize
[1:50:30] it into a very general statement as
[1:50:32] there is a divine expression it's the
[1:50:35] Word of God and it's come out in these
[1:50:37] prophecies around all of us don't spread
[1:50:54] your resource of affections you know
[1:50:57] it's a resource that God's given you
[1:50:59] it's a channel in your spirit where you
[1:51:01] can enjoy things now if you might have
[1:51:04] you let's say you spread it out too much
[1:51:06] and there are things that we need to
[1:51:09] spread it out on like our children
[1:51:11] family there are good things and I'm not
[1:51:13] saying that you shouldn't do those
[1:51:15] things they're very very important but
[1:51:18] we don't want to Mar our relationship
[1:51:21] the Lord Mar that image and it can be
[1:51:24] mad and clouded over all sorts of things
[1:51:29] many things in this world is critically
[1:51:32] designed to fill it very easily and the
[1:51:37] human nature will just
[1:51:40] very quickly
[1:51:42] oh my help me Jesus oh the gravitates
[1:51:46] you know you just become acclimatized
[1:51:49] when you get acclimatized to passive
[1:51:52] entertainment instant gratification
[1:51:55] instantly pleasure by all of these
[1:51:58] stimulations of the world when you come
[1:52:03] to church your affections are so-so
[1:52:09] you spend most of the service and
[1:52:11] sometimes by the end of the service you
[1:52:13] start feeling good sometimes it's you
[1:52:17] come into church and you're so full of
[1:52:18] all these worries and Leary's and
[1:52:21] natural thinking and Oh fears and all
[1:52:24] these things and the worship service
[1:52:26] starts to move and to clear those things
[1:52:28] but you're not attuned to above because
[1:52:33] there is an expression happening an
[1:52:35] eternity there is a divine expression
[1:52:38] it's like a broadcast or casting all
[1:52:42] over this place Amen if you are
[1:52:46] spiritually fit your affections are
[1:52:51] tuned in to that broadcast and when the
[1:52:55] word goes forth your reaction comes up
[1:52:57] and as United and theophany United and
[1:53:02] re in eternity and even if the glory
[1:53:05] doesn't all fall down in the service and
[1:53:07] everyone's affect your Amen Helen oh
[1:53:12] yeah because you came by the blood you
[1:53:18] have exits the veils torn the bales
[1:53:21] raped amen
[1:53:22] it's not Satan that holds us back from a
[1:53:26] pure reaction to the word it's us old
[1:53:30] nature it's I'm gonna talk about David
[1:53:35] soon when he saw the art coming Beck and
[1:53:36] McHale and how Macau is like his old
[1:53:39] nature you know our old nature and she
[1:53:42] was looking through the window and
[1:53:44] seeing her husband shamelessly
[1:53:49] uncovering his eternal image
[1:53:52] hallelujah shamelessly he didn't care
[1:53:58] what other people thought he got caught
[1:54:01] up in the vision he got caught up in the
[1:54:04] unfailing realities and the significance
[1:54:07] of this message became so real to him oh
[1:54:10] my he couldn't stand still he got so
[1:54:14] caught up in the spirit the prophets in
[1:54:16] his arms were moving in every direction
[1:54:18] oh my us all those things happen at the
[1:54:20] conviction hallelujah
[1:54:21] I saw those things happening already
[1:54:23] Amen there was a knock coming to New
[1:54:26] Zealand hallelujah Amen the ark was
[1:54:29] coming to Jerusalem amen this Jerusalem
[1:54:33] hallelujah there was a knock coming as
[1:54:36] somebody got excited somebody realized
[1:54:39] how important it is oh my
[1:54:43] there was nothing could hold them back
[1:54:45] there were people dancing they probably
[1:54:47] never does their life because McCall got
[1:54:51] to fear hallelujah I saw Bros dancing
[1:54:57] like in I said they've never danced
[1:54:58] before near life because they were just
[1:55:01] letting it loose and I rejoiced
[1:55:05] hallelujah there wasn't there was no
[1:55:09] style
[1:55:10] there was no smooth moves
[1:55:13] it was just loose in every direction oh
[1:55:20] my goodness there's what happens when
[1:55:23] the significance of the vision becomes
[1:55:27] reality oh I bet power pulls people
[1:55:32] right out of themselves that power of
[1:55:34] the Bob will pull you out of this
[1:55:36] dimension one day and God is
[1:55:39] conditioning you to get over your makar
[1:55:41] oh my let me read that we're uh here it
[1:55:46] is I'm just gonna read these and then
[1:55:48] get on to the scripture so says I D
[1:55:52] revolution your identification is under
[1:55:55] a revolution
[1:55:57] there's the revolt happening in your
[1:55:59] and it's pulling you out of your old
[1:56:00] nature pulling you out of yourself so
[1:56:04] you're in a strait betwixt two your
[1:56:07] natural heritage and your eternal
[1:56:10] heritage even after the new birth
[1:56:13] don't think when I cuz I got the new
[1:56:15] birth this is how I am and I'm gonna be
[1:56:17] like that an eternity don't kid yourself
[1:56:19] it's not how you are you're on a journey
[1:56:21] hey man hey man hallelujah
[1:56:25] selfish motives answer in the hearts
[1:56:27] that will inhibit your experience that
[1:56:31] will inhibit if there's anybody on here
[1:56:33] in here there has an answer in DeHart
[1:56:35] something in their life that they
[1:56:37] haven't given over you are robbing
[1:56:40] yourself blind
[1:56:42] you're robbing yourself more than you
[1:56:45] could ever imagine
[1:56:46] oh my you know you I'm having a good
[1:56:50] time I'm having a really good time right
[1:56:53] now
[1:56:53] now the Lord showed me one day cuz I

[1:57:05] was having a good time like that and the
[1:57:06] Lord just spoke and I don't even know
[1:57:08] when it was maybe it was after the
[1:57:10] service or at the service you can have
[1:57:12] just a good of time you can enjoy the
[1:57:14] service just like the preacher
[1:57:16] hallelujah because the preacher is under
[1:57:20] the same inspiration the same voice of
[1:57:23] the Resurrection that is inside you the
[1:57:27] same so just let loose and meet God let
[1:57:33] go of all of the self styles all the
[1:57:36] naturals thinking all of the old ways
[1:57:38] and let the expression fully effective
[1:57:44] Amen hallelujah
[1:57:47] you have guys you'll be up here come on
[1:57:52] hallelujah it was people bashing the
[1:57:55] stage on him like they were getting
[1:57:58] caught up men oh my it was some real
[1:58:01] things going on hallelujah approaching
[1:58:08] God through a mirage of past revivals
[1:58:10] and I'll help in a minute
[1:58:13] you understand what I mean by that
[1:58:14] approaching gods through a mirage of
[1:58:16] past revivals remember the gate as his
[1:58:19] name right the way you enter into
[1:58:22] fellowship the way you put your hand on
[1:58:24] the head of the Lamb is through the
[1:58:28] unfolding it's through the
[1:58:32] interpretation of Scripture we sing the
[1:58:34] song God interprets his word by bringing
[1:58:37] it to pass when it comes to pass that is
[1:58:42] the person doing it that hung on the
[1:58:45] cross if you want to be friends if you
[1:58:47] want the cross to affect your life
[1:58:48] you've got to come his providing way
[1:58:51] you've got to come through the gate that
[1:58:53] he puts his naming and that gate is the
[1:58:56] fulfillment of scripture for your day
[1:58:57] and if you approach God and the repenter
[1:59:01] costal gate under a charismatic gate
[1:59:04] under a Baptist gate under any
[1:59:05] denominational gate you'll just have
[1:59:07] your own faith and your own anointings
[1:59:09] and your own miracles and your own world
[1:59:12] and that you imagine God to show you and
[1:59:14] you're not ripped your worship is not
[1:59:17] truly accepted because you're just a
[1:59:20] historian and the cross is just history
[1:59:22] but if you come through the gate that he
[1:59:25] places his name where he's fulfilling
[1:59:29] his word you will transcend and deport
[1:59:32] yourself out of this realm into an
[1:59:35] eternal realm where it becomes a reality
[1:59:37] and the very sacrifice becomes real to
[1:59:39] you and you're born again and now your
[1:59:42] worship can be expressed amen oh my
[1:59:49] that's acceptable with worshiping by
[1:59:55] education or knowledge read these I
[1:59:59] promise our reactions should be
[2:00:01] appropriate to the expression preached
[2:00:04] or taught okay because otherwise you
[2:00:08] know people might think oh you've got a
[2:00:10] shot every time the preacher sees that's
[2:00:12] not like it's the thought that's being
[2:00:16] preached
[2:00:17] and the union the like-mindedness be of
[2:00:21] the same mind let this mind be in you
[2:00:24] did you know set your affection and let
[2:00:29] this mind is the same word
[2:00:31] it's the same word these two scriptures
[2:00:35] they set your affection on things above
[2:00:38] and not on these earthly things and let
[2:00:42] this mind be in you has the same word
[2:00:47] Amen let it be in you
[2:00:51] now there's another mind in you and her
[2:00:52] name is McCall that's your old cultural
[2:00:55] and Habashi
[2:00:56] we'll talk about that in a minute if
[2:00:58] we've got time let me see
[2:01:00] okay we should notice an increase in our
[2:01:04] development of reaction to match our
[2:01:07] eternal theophany we should notice that
[2:01:11] the way you reacted one year ago
[2:01:15] should be different to the way you react
[2:01:19] now and then you believe that the way
[2:01:25] that you approached God
[2:01:27] the the the experience the maturity of
[2:01:31] your reaction should be different than
[2:01:35] what it was a year ago if it's not
[2:01:37] you're leading McCall rule your life
[2:01:39] you're leading your cultural and her
[2:01:41] bitching all of these things take to you
[2:01:44] and it becomes an idol because it gets
[2:01:47] between you and God imagine if David did
[2:01:51] dead and said David as a man after my
[2:01:56] own heart
[2:01:57] oh and he's looking now the father
[2:02:00] seeketh such there's a bride
[2:02:06] that when she hears that word when she
[2:02:09] hears that preaching when she has the
[2:02:11] expression and it's so great it's so
[2:02:19] great that it was exactly what he's
[2:02:21] seeking that says for you I did and your
[2:02:27] lives are hid with Christ in God that
[2:02:30] means that McCall has deep
[2:02:33] she's fruitless you know brother Branham
[2:02:36] he had this experience and he said that
[2:02:39] after he let go of them a call and he
[2:02:42] let himself loose he said I had great
[2:02:44] victory after victory oh my that's
[2:02:50] profound me that is absolutely profound
[2:02:53] and you wonder why you sit there
[2:02:58] struggling struggling and yet you
[2:03:01] believe the word you struggle cuz you're
[2:03:07] not letting go because you're not on the
[2:03:10] Kim the old way and leading that's it
[2:03:16] the Prophet said he said you know
[2:03:20] someone cannot sit I'm so selfish I've
[2:03:23] prayed I've kept the devil's and he said
[2:03:25] it don't do that see through the
[2:03:27] opposite go and be extremely and selfish
[2:03:31] and it will re did your mentality amen

[2:03:40] opposite of what my call

[2:03:46] things that you thought you would never

[2:05:02] windows this is like you've been so you
[2:05:06] never did this before the people never
[2:05:09] did that before why why didn't they do
[2:05:13] it before because God is restoring back

[2:05:19] church is coming up hallelujah McCall is
[2:05:24] losing the battle hallelujah God didn't
[2:05:27] let the devil win amen
[2:05:30] oh my hallelujah Oh a supernatural

[2:05:39] and our ability to enter the secret of
[2:05:43] worship easy I'm telling you now we're
[2:05:49] just laying a looks like the whole
[2:05:51] sermon is the foundation but that's
[2:05:53] alright I was gonna just speak these
[2:05:55] things and then actually preach you know
[2:05:56] but yeah well the Lord has his own way
[2:05:59] set your affections on things above not
[2:06:01] on things of the earth for you I did and
[2:06:04] your life is hid with Christ in God oh
[2:06:06] my see that set your affection be of the
[2:06:10] same mind and let this mind be in you
[2:06:17] and Deuteronomy 16-5 now this is I'm
[2:06:21] only laying this as a foundation to show
[2:06:24] you the way in because that's the
[2:06:29] foundation it's the basis and if you had
[2:06:31] and the revelation of Jesus Christ as
[2:06:34] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and his
[2:06:37] Spirit has come in the form of a mighty
[2:06:40] angel with an open book with all of your
[2:06:43] inheritance all the past ages he had a
[2:06:45] limited inheritance for the people even
[2:06:48] the first church the book was still
[2:06:51] closed he came down but the book was
[2:06:52] closed amen
[2:06:54] there was an angel leading them and
[2:06:57] through the church ages he gave a
[2:06:59] portion a portion closed book closed
[2:07:01] book but then finally at the end he says
[2:07:04] I'm going to search my people right back
[2:07:07] and they're going to escape them mccall
[2:07:09] nature because I'm going to do an
[2:07:11] extract search hallelujah I'm going to

[2:09:07] season didn't say much but now things
[2:09:10] are changing because God wants you

[2:10:41] you right back to your origins amen
[2:10:45] oh my David did not care what McCall for
[2:10:48] she's gonna talk and she's gonna ramble
[2:10:51] but one day she's gonna leave hallelujah
[2:10:54] ain't gonna get so she gonna be out of
[2:10:57] her place
[2:10:58] hey man hello yeah you let us stay down
[2:11:01] in the Dead Sea because that's where the
[2:11:03] Jordan River should have taken her when
[2:11:05] you crossed over and got the Holy Ghost
[2:11:07] you meet to die to those things
[2:11:09] hallelujah but we don't always die to
[2:11:11] everything we don't everything we
[2:11:13] understand and we just surrender our
[2:11:15] whole lives but then as we come under
[2:11:18] the leadership of the captain that's
[2:11:20] bringing us back to eternity he takes us
[2:11:22] on a journey and he starts to bring
[2:11:24] these things out times are changing
[2:11:27] this is a change of seasons here is a
[2:11:31] real change taking place it might not be
[2:11:34] long States when you least expect that's
[2:11:45] when oh my we caught up hey man oh look
[2:11:53] the mayor's not sacrifice to Passover
[2:11:56] which were than any of my gate which the
[2:11:59] LORD thy God giveth thee but at the
[2:12:01] place which the LORD thy God shall
[2:12:02] choose two places named and there thou
[2:12:05] shalt sacrifice the Passover
[2:12:07] now just in case there's some critics
[2:12:12] the Passover was sacrificed once and for
[2:12:16] all I'm not talking about that we're not
[2:12:18] resurfacing
[2:12:20] he's already sick but it's
[2:12:24] how do we access and because you there's
[2:12:29] no point
[2:12:29] and you singing expressing reacting
[2:12:33] dancing or anything until you've had
[2:12:36] this until you have personally buy
[2:12:39] genuine faith and the name of Jesus
[2:12:42] Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:12:44] you've come through the gate of His
[2:12:47] perfect will for this day and he opens
[2:12:50] the gate and Nick she walks for eternity
[2:12:51] and put your hand that was taken and the
[2:13:00] power of God or my grants you divine
[2:13:03] access when ever you what don't have to
[2:13:09] wait God's given you access yes you wait
[2:13:13] on the Lord for your ministry you wait
[2:13:14] on the Lord for many things but he's
[2:13:23] hungry for you and he doesn't he doesn't
[2:13:28] hurt holding you back oh the mighty
[2:13:31] angel and he descended into your land
[2:13:36] when you crossed over and he put his
[2:13:38] feet because why she's going down
[2:13:44] why are those brazen feet are pushing
[2:13:46] her right down under your feet as he
[2:13:48] descends down into your life it's my
[2:13:51] call down there she's calling she's
[2:13:53] screaming she's telling you don't do it
[2:13:56] she does not want you to have all your
[2:13:58] privilege go beyond the camp
[2:14:08] through the opposite Amen you know when
[2:14:12] I first became a Christian and the call
[2:14:14] was going wild so he was telling me many
[2:14:18] things all the cast referred you look
[2:14:19] you've always ridiculed Christianity and
[2:14:21] you've always done listen now you're
[2:14:23] praying and now you're doing vision it's
[2:14:24] like don't you look silly and all the
[2:14:26] sort of stuff and I was it battling with
[2:14:28] listening but because I was too
[2:14:35] to certain thought processes and certain
[2:14:38] frequencies going down a certain line
[2:14:40] dying in a certain way always that way
[2:14:43] and you've got to come out of it and
[2:14:46] there is a power in this room to bring
[2:14:49] you out of it there's a perilous room to
[2:14:53] take your McCall nature and do away with
[2:14:55] it hallelujah you know do you understand
[2:15:00] what I mean
[2:15:01] the mighty angel himself because it's
[2:15:03] personal when you look at the book of
[2:15:05] Revelation and you see that and you see
[2:15:07] it kept coming to the prophet and the
[2:15:09] seventh angel
[2:15:09] that's dispensational that's the age but
[2:15:13] anything that happens dispensation needs
[2:15:17] to happen it needs to be a personal
[2:15:20] experience in the book of Revelation
[2:15:23] it's a pleasure
[2:15:23] showing a dispensational truth a
[2:15:27] fulfillment but then it has to become
[2:15:30] personal the same angel that came down
[2:15:33] with an open book on the sea and upon
[2:15:35] the earth must come down into you amen
[2:15:43] man I'm not going to get to the the I'm
[2:15:46] going to do a part two and I ain't gonna
[2:15:48] get to the very meat of this but amen
[2:15:53] maybe this is just the Lord's preparing
[2:15:55] I just I pray so much Lord how do i you
[2:15:59] know you prepare and everything and it's
[2:16:02] like Lord it's just such a burden but
[2:16:06] it's not my burden it's his burden he's
[2:16:09] he's got a genius from New Zealand ideas
[2:16:16] but remember you yes you've given God
[2:16:20] three minutes but you still make the
[2:16:22] final decision on whether you D throne
[2:16:25] McCall whether you and remember whose
[2:16:29] daughter she is saw you've already
[2:16:32] thrown Saul I hope man if you haven't
[2:16:35] the thrown soil man you're in trouble
[2:16:37] those are just blatant inferiority
[2:16:39] complexes going on that are restricting
[2:16:42] your experience this she still hold on
[2:16:45] it's spirit
[2:16:50] you with me you understand
[2:16:52] he runs clear but if we walk in the
[2:16:57] harem Doucet ruses name and beard thou
[2:16:59] shalt sacrifice the Passover and even is
[2:17:02] always an evening sacrifice identify as
[2:17:05] us at the end time as well at the going
[2:17:07] down of the Sun at the season that thou
[2:17:09] camest forth out of Egypt so if you
[2:17:12] haven't come this provided way you're
[2:17:14] still in Egypt no matter how much you go
[2:17:17] to church worship God and go all through
[2:17:19] and have an amazing worldwide musical
[2:17:22] experience and worship like Lucifer oh
[2:17:26] so good at worship here's the act was
[2:17:29] the Archangel of wish oh my those
[2:17:31] churches are under a big anointing
[2:17:33] alright but it's not the anointing of
[2:17:35] God my it's not the skill it doesn't
[2:17:39] have the ring it doesn't have the same
[2:17:42] except what Cain Cain's sacrifice in his
[2:17:47] worship probably looked a lot nicer than
[2:17:48] Abel's Abel's was so fundamental doesn't
[2:17:55] mean too much yes it's important but not
[2:17:57] too much
[2:17:57] it's the revelation he reveals himself
[2:18:01] in the form that he is manifesting in
[2:18:06] his page that's how he reveals himself
[2:18:09] and when you come in communion with him
[2:18:11] through that gate through that channel
[2:18:14] all of Calvary and everything he's ever
[2:18:16] done and all the promises that are in
[2:18:18] the book of Revelation
[2:18:19] hallelujah aren't you glad he raised up
[2:18:22] a light of a prophet and to walk you
[2:18:25] through the book of Revelation did you
[2:18:27] know that angel that prophet that led
[2:18:30] John through many of those pages was
