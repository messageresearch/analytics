everyone great to have everyone here this morning like welcome sorry here god bless you amen great to have you here god bless you amen amen let's turn to the scriptures uh let's go to revelations 15 and 1. and just a reminder we've got communion foot washing to uh this wednesday at 7 30. let's go to revelations 15 and one was going to read the first four verses and then we're going to go to first john 5 and then we're going to go to judges 3 and 31. amen trust everyone's well praise the lord by the way i'm saying you just can't lose being a christian amen so everyone's good amen revelations 15 and 1. and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues from them has filled up the wrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the hearts of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god in the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous of thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest amen and we're going to go to first john 5 and 1. and we're going to read just the first five verses here amen so first john 5 and 1 it says whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that lo that beget loveth him sorry and everyone that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that believer sorry who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god and we're going to judges just one verse in judges three and the last i believe it's the last verse of of chapter 3 which is verse 31 and it says an after him was shamgar the son of anath you know the prophet says that there's only one scripture written about sham gaba that's enough when you like one scripture written about you there's actually a whole book written about you and type and shadow reflecting you but says here and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines 600 men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a knee just want to raise your hands to the lord amen let's pray together shall we lift our needs before a throne of grace gracious heavenly father once again lord we are so thankful that we can only believe lord you've made us believers lord that all things are possible lord jesus and we dear god we thank you we can come into your presence one more time as a redeemed ransom body washed in your blood lord call by your name father i ask that you would forgive all of our sins and our iniquities our trespasses lord make every part of our life not just the bad the things we regret but even the good lord every part of us may we just be covered in your blood lord when you look upon us you don't see us but you just hear our voice through the blood may you grant it dear god we're not lord seeking for your judgment or we pleaders is for your mercy lord said father we just asking may you come down one more time in your great mercy may he speak to our hearts may you meet every need lord you see the hands that are raised and the burdens and the needs behind those raised hands dear god i pray that this would be the time this would be the hour where those needs are met father feel glory lord questions would be answered lord hearts would be mended father joy would be unspeakable full of glory in our lives father i pray that you'll just touch our lives like only you can may you anoint speaker and hear it one more time lord help me get myself out of the way lord that you can minister what you want minister today we love you so much we thank you and appreciate you for your goodness in our lives we also asking for those who couldn't make it lord today be their portion father if their second body may heal them lord jesus father lord may you lift them up for your glory we love you we thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats uh this morning the prince of the lord i'd like to speak about when you realize you're standing in victory hallelujah because you know we are stan the bride is standing in victory this morning hallelujah so now we read there in uh revelations 15 of a group of people and we know that they are the 144 000 because they sing the uh song of moses and the song of the lamb which is this is what the jews will sing but you know it says that they have gotten the victory over his image over the beast you know over his mark and the number of his name so gotten the victory is a is a past tense thing and it's very it's very wonderful to look back you know we could have a testimony really a testimony service is when we look at how god gave us the victory in the past right so we can look back and say god gave us the victory there but it's incredible when we can realize that we are standing in victory you may be in the worst part of your life right now the biggest battle the hardest time ever of your christian journey but if you can realize you have the victory in the battle that you already have the victory amen that then i believe the burden will be lighter you can rejoice knowing that you've already won amen that you are going to come out packing the victory because you are living in victory because i believe victory is not just a condition but it's a state of being hallelujah and i believe the bride this morning right now is living in victory amen so i trust that this will just lift a few burdens we can go shouting even even even in the greatest battle because remember being being victorious does not make the devil go away right he you know we we are not built just to rejoice when everything's good but we should be able to conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of god in the greatest trials that's our privilege to to hold have our shoulders back our heads held high thanking god that he's got it all in control and we face a defeated being this morning now i um uh we didn't read it but you know first you have to get victory within yourself before you can live in victory right so this is not just a well-eye victory but first you got to get victory within yourself now what i mean by this is that you've got to be you yeah i trust that as believers you can look back in a time of your life where you wrestled with the angel of the lord like jacob did and he changed you that's how you get victory within yourself right so you know we won't read it but but jacob you know he came to a spot in his life where where you know he was going back to meet his brother and we know that we we do reap what we sow and you know he he he showed a few things he was about to reap but you know god was god was in control of the situation because god allows things to come into our life that it's only us and him he will he will make conditions come into our life where we can't turn to nothing else there's no more excuses we can put our hands on or this person this one or this but it's you and him alone and because god had to change jacob from jacob to israel a prince with god we know jacob means supplanter and he tricked his brother tricked everyone around about him but then it came to a place where god said you can't you can't live by that name anymore because we know a name represents a life right you think of moses you think of the life moses lived you think elijah the life elijah lived jesus you think the life he lived you know the apostle paul the life he lived it's because it's in a name right so that's why his name had to be changed because god didn't want to continue on as a supplanter twisting the truth changing facts to try and get advantage over people you know embellishing things diminishing things half lies white lies whatever color lie you know trying to that's being a supplanter but god doesn't want us to be like that god wants wants us to be princes and princesses with god so you know jacob sent his family sent his livestock before him before because esau was on the other side of the river with i think 400 men and you know and and um you know jacob did not have any form of an army or you know he didn't know what was going to happen he thought if he just sends gifts trying to buy favor and this is what the world is full of these days trying to buy a favor brother ram says you can't buy friends you know people send money at billions of dollars overseas and try and buy a country's friendship it don't work right that's not what we should be doing but you know well two degree but anyway well you know we should see they didn't help one another you know what i mean but yeah you can't buy friendship that's what i'm trying to get it but you see so jacob came to a point where it was him and god alone and he wrestled with the angel of the lord until god changed him and that's what will happen god will allow pressure to come on in our lives he can even cause us to lose everything but in order to get our attention that there will be nothing but us and him but we have to hold on to him until we have been changed by him amen so god wants to wrestle with you in prayer in order that you lay your entire life down you surrender your entire will your entire heart that he changes you like he did jacob this is what he does with does with every believer yeah because he touched his thigh and he walked with a limp from that moment on so his life that he lived his walk in this world was changed because god touched him i mean maybe the next day when he when he when he crosses the river or whatever you know and you know goes to his family they could ask him what happened to you he said i've been touched by the angel of god now my walk is different he didn't need to say anything his walk was different he couldn't walk the same way i mean then from before because his life had been changed it's the same thing with you and i when god truly comes into our life not just being religious not just trying to be a better person but when god fills you with the with his presence with the baptism of the holy ghost you don't need to tell anyone everyone will see it hallelujah amen people will see a difference you know i remember when you know uh when i was at university and i you know i worked part-time in a kitchen and you know and but during that time i met the lord and then so chris and i got married and you know she worked there in the kitchen a little bit and um you know i didn't i didn't tell the people i worked with and i'd known them for about six years i didn't tell them i'd become a christian meet the lord but but their testimony was we are so happy when this is what they said to christine we're so happy when ben met his god because before he was empty he was depressed he was down but now he's different what happened i wrestle with an angel the angel wrestled with me rather he says you can't live the same kind of life you got to be changed hallelujah so you know jacob was changed to israel and you say when that happened he got the victory now he was living in victory beforehand he was trying to have victory by his own schemes but then afterwards he was living a victory because god had changed his life we don't want to be living in victory because of our own schemes and what we can work out that's being a supplanter right we want to be living in victory because god has changed our lives are you in that condition today i trust you are brother i'm saying the door inside the door in 1958 he says see but if god will just speak to your heart and open that door that your eyes can see that he's here and his goodness he will load you with it my prayer is that you'll open your heart tonight and i'll say this morning your understanding open your heart of faith open the door to the selfishness open the door to indifference open the door of malice that's in your heart and let christ come in and be the full lord and governor of your life he says let us pray with heads bowed pardon me eternal and blessed god such a wonderful audience we could just speak similarly all night but the hour is moving on we thank thee that thou dost still knock at the at man's heart's door we thank thee that thou art still willing to come in and sup and discuss with us any problem that we have amen if it's sin you'll discuss it with us if we've got pride you'll discuss that give us a cure if it's sickness thou art the great physician standing at the door knocking if it's a lack of understanding you'll open our eyes if any man lacks wisdom let him ask god that's the scripture father and we believe it to be thy truth i pray god that just now that you'll knock at many hearts those every heart that has a need may your holy spirit at the door now knock and say child or man open up your door and i'll come in and discuss this problem with you if you want more grace i'll give it to you if you want more faith i'll give it to you if you want your eyes of understanding to be opened i have sell for them i'm the great physician i'm the one who keep kept the israelites food all through the 40 years of journey i preserved their clothing till they never went thread bear that's what i mean by by wrestling with god in prayer you you wrestle with him you open your heart he comes in and discusses your problems with you and he's the one who fixes it he's the one who makes it right hallelujah that's and and then once that happens hey you're changed amen when god steps in and changes your life amen you are changed hallelujah now brother brahm says in victory day and you know if you want to hear a good sermon listen to victory day 1963. he says what the church needs to do is to do like jacob pray till you get a v-day which is victory day and right jacob had a wrestling party he wrestled all night long with the lord but he said i'm not going to let you go until i get this victory then about daylight one morning he had a v-day he didn't walk the same anymore but on his side he was see on this side this before he met the angel he was a great big strong fearful church member but on the other side this is after he was touched by the angel he was a little limping prince i mean with enough courage to fight the whole army esau said i'll furnish you an army he said i don't need it he had a v-day we don't need the organizations we don't need their stuff for this world we don't need i mean to have the tally and the things of this world we've had we've had a v-day we wrestled one day or one night um oh remember how i wrestled i then when i had to die to myself but there come a v-day amen when i got the victory amen when god's word become right the baptist church to me was no more than any other organization that's right i had a v-day god's word is right amen and when you have that victory day amen when you diet to yourself when the word becomes your real absolute becomes your foundation amen god comes and lives in your life now you're living in victory i mean so there's some of you here have not had that time with the angel amen you get a hold of him he's here he there's already situations in life where he's trying to get your attention i mean you should you should turn to him and say lord i want to hold on to you till you change me i need victory i need a permanent victory hallelujah he's here to give you that victory yes amen amen now so we realized so so for the believer now we're now living in victory amen amen and we have to realize that so because there's a big difference between praying to get victory which is what jacob had to do then praying from victory right because remember we are i trust as a believer on the other side where now you're now walking in victory because god is now in you now we have to realize that if if you're standing in victory then you are already victorious and you're fighting an enemy from a position that you are victorious already over him right he's a defeated foe right he's a defeated foe there'll still be a contest you know the devil doesn't quit the devil doesn't quit he knows he has but a short time right he knows he's going to burn in the lake of fire he fights it with everything within him he's very determined but he you know he doesn't just quit when when abraham was told by god your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land being egypt then i'm going to bring them here with a mighty hand you know the devil didn't quit he didn't inspire all the people of those lands just to leave now he began to inspire them to build jericho build the wall so thick that the chariot race could go around and fortify the people anoint them to make armies and things because the devil is going to put up a fight it's the same thing with you and i god touches your life one time the devil don't quit he doesn't wave a flag of yo's flag of strength to say well i might as well leave that one alone now that's when he puts your his guns upon you i mean but you've got to realize you have victory over that weapon hallelujah as it says in isaiah no weapon formed against you shall prosper why is that because you're standing in victory there'll still be battles there's still my you know you're going to realize every mind battle shall not prosper you're above that thing you know jesus has the name above every name so everything that can be named that name is beneath the name of jesus christ amen he has been lifted so high we're going gonna look up into the heavens and see he's been lifted up so high far above all principality power demon power sickness disease complex a past whatever it is our lord jesus being lifted up high above all those things but you've got to recognize we are you are a joint heir with jesus christ so if he's been lifted high above all things if you're a joiner you've been lifted up with him above every problem you may be facing he is in a victorious position and because we are joint here with him we are victorious as well you have got to realize this thing whatever demon power whatever thing is fighting your complex you're greater than the complex you're above the complex i mean whatever demon spirit may be moving whatever's whatever's fighting you right now you're above it because you've been lifted up above that thing hallelujah why we are victorious because he has made us victorious we need to realize that we cannot defeat the devil in our own strength man has tried to outsmart him for thousands of years and every time those men have failed so we can't defeat him in our own human ability it doesn't matter how much we know the message no we know the scripture how we can put it all together human abilities failure to begin with the prophet says that we are failures to begin with because we're born in sin shaped inequity come to the world speaking lies doesn't matter how good you are your intentions may be good you always fail but if god steps in then you're victorious if the victorious one steps into your life then you'll have the victory hallelujah amen the prophet says this he says he conquered the gate of temptation by the word this is the lord jesus remember we he said there's a promise that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy and that promise was passed down through the through the scriptures he conquered the gate of temptation by the word and the key was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all he conquered every sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death in hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're of a natural seed this is a spiritual seed he conquered the gates of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and now we're more than conquerors we're just we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything's defeated i say complexes are defeated regret's defeated i mean pain's defeated i mean whatever whatever thing guilt is defeated all these things have been defeated because our god defeated it all hallelujah and we're more than conquerors that if you're more than a conqueror you're living in victory we can stand right now in this present evil age and overcome hallelujah that's why we read there in first john 5 our faith overcometh the world so we may be standing in the darkest age there's ever been but we are victory and we already have within us the faith the revelation to overcome that's why you got to realize don't be intimidated by the devil sure he's intimidating he's a bluff he'll try and scare us do whatever he can but don't be intimidated by him you gotta say boo back yes and you know there's a variant of uh delta called boo apparently i say boo hoo we don't need to fear anything amen why because we're victorious god's made us victorious it's not you making yourself victorious see see we're going to get our you know we put pressure on ourselves to overcome no if he overcame and he's in us he'll overcome through you you've just got to let go and let god have his way amen amen we're dealing with now where were we yes we are dealing now he says here hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my i wish i was twice my size then maybe i feel twice as good i mean we are disputing with a conquered enemy no wonder paul could say when he was when they were building a block to chop his head off said oh death where is your sting show me where you can make me squirmer and scream grave where's your victory and you think you'll mold me out there i mean i'll point you to an empty one an empty tomb there and i am in him he'll raise me up for the last day a defeated enemy the royal seed of abraham now the natural seed could not point to that but the royal seed can conquer already conquered for he has gone before us and conquered every gate for us he is now after two thousand years he stands in the midst of us the mighty conqueror not only did he conquer sickness how many conquered temptation he conquered every enemy he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and rose up again and two thousand years later here he stands among us this afternoon i'll say this morning identifying himself the mighty conqueror amen he's still here alive vindicating his promise the royal seat of abraham oh my he will conquer the gates of his enemy i mean to those seed he stands there alive to vindicate himself to who those predestinated seeds that can see it so he's here to vindicate you who can see it who has eyes of understanding in this day so he's here to vindicate his promised word to you i mean because you see it he said in one place the world shall not see me but you'll see me that means that's how you know you're not of the world because you see him in this day hallelujah amen hallelujah he says this here that they were sealed he says he conquered that he says he will conquer the gates of his enemy to those seed he stands here alive to vindicate himself to who those predestinated seeds that can see it he conquered that who after his test of the promise of the word they were sealed by the holy ghost into the body of christ to them confirmed what hebrews 38 to be so they are sealed in there by the holy ghost that the holy ghost which was by abraham foresaw it by faith he believed it and now we receive it looking back to the promise of what he said and john 14 12 is made confirmed in this last days by the risen conqueror himself hallelujah amen we know john 14 12 he that believeth in me the works that i do he shall do also and greater than these shall you do because i go to my father hallelujah we're going to lay claim on every promise you know we may be living in victory but that doesn't mean we just we just quit we should press in we should press in amen amen he says and sirs we would see jesus he says brother foot footprints is possession he says ministering breath and i can say this for everyone don't be afraid to uh put footprints where god has told you to go so if god has told you to go buy a stripes i'm healed go there claim it he says the promise is for you and your children go there amen if he said that by his stripes i'm healed or i'm you know here's your peace go there whatever promise in the scripture don't be afraid to lay claim on it jesus died for you to receive it amen it's possession he told joshua everywhere the souls of your feet set that's yours amen we don't back up we take what god said and that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems how difficult it seems if god said so it's yours that we have a real enemy we're fighting right he's not just a thought he's not just an idea he's a real being right but he'll try and bluff you and try and intimidate you off your promises off your inheritance right so but it doesn't matter how big the opposition seems he can seem pretty big right how great it seems how difficult it seems i say how impossible it seems don't look at those things if god said it you say i believe it and i receive it and it's mine amen you go get it amen he when he gave it to joshua he never said i'll take all of the philistines and hittites and highways out of the land and give it to you joshua had to fight for every inch of ground but god was with him that makes a big difference right there amen if god be for me who can be against me hallelujah and every inch of ground you'll cover brother to make footprints you'll fight your way through but take the sword of the spirit brother and move right on foot step footprints is possession made a transition in his life he was born into victory because he was a covenant israelite circumcised believer living in the promised land he can be a lot like a lot of message folks today who really know god they can be living we can be sealed into the kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost living in our inheritance walking in faith but yet when the enemy comes in sometimes we forget who we are and shamgar didn't realize who he was because he allowed the philistines to come in every year and take his crops away dr brother brown dramatized it real well i mean where god would begin to work and your life would come forth in his land and you know he about yo he'd harvest all the crops and maybe he'd think well surely this winter we're going to get through but then he heard the same old stomp of the philistines coming down the road fully armed you know it's amazing the devil will send 600 soldiers against one man why because the devil was afraid if shamgar only realized who he was who he was right there that's why he said you think you think maybe one or two hey this is a farmer he's gonna why why why seen 600. it's because the devil's afraid if we really realize who we are who we are who god has made us already because the scripture says now we are the sons of god right now we are not one day we are right now and so the devil was afraid if this man really realizes who he is amen and shamgar came to a point in his life because he saw the need of his children he saw his you know maybe is the other dress of his daughter all ragged and she's all thin and skin and bony has looked into his wife's eyes and you know maybe he saw only distress and pain and worry how are we going to get through this year shamga maybe she said just with an expression but then he began to realize something god has made a covenant he made it with my forefathers abraham isaac and jacob and we could and we would sit around the fire we'd tell the stories of joshua and what god had done mighty things and and you know moses bringing the people out and the supernatural done and he began to realize i'm of that lineage i'm of these people i'm a believer in jehovah that same jehovah is alive today now he did not have a story of another man who took an ox code and killed 600 enemies but he realized who he was and the prophet said when he realized who he was that was enough hallelujah and notice it doesn't say in the scripture that he counted because the bible says one will chase a thousand he didn't stop there and say now mr philistines can you line up i need to count you to see if i can win this battle no he took his ox code which is not a weapon by the way i mean he jumped into the middle of the street or the road the prophet said and he killed every one of those philistines he downed everyone because he realized who he was so he went from a moment of living in defeat but born into victory you say well that was a natural lineage but this is a faith lineage this is a faith lineage i mean god gave a promise to the bride hallelujah we've received the same holy ghost the first amen the alpha bride received hallelujah and the same god will do the same things amen against the same enemy in your life hallelujah so he realized he was a believer and he killed every one of those enemies hallelujah why because he went from actually being born in victory but living in defeat to actually realizing he was in victory and then that victory manifested in front of him one dead philistine at a time could you imagine that feeling of saying you know one moment you're all distressed within yourself they're going to take everything how we're going to survive we barely survived last winter how's this going to happen and then you begin to realize i'm a son of abraham my seat will possess the gates of the enemy i mean this is our land jehovah's my god he's not just there god he's my god he'll give me the victory hallelujah and he runs and he kills them all hallelujah amen so he went from being in defeat being born in victory but being in defeat to being in victory and then getting the victory hallelujah hello shamgarh how are you today you're doing pretty good hallelujah so it doesn't matter what enemy you're facing today you've got to realize i have the victory right now the victory is in me if he is in you greater than you that he is in the world hallelujah no matter what obstacle circumstance condition we have the victory hallelujah amen now brother braham would he would say this about about shamga i'll just read this portion of it he says you know what sham god began to think you know i'm not a fighter but i'm a son of abraham i'm of the tribe in the lineage and i'm circumcised i know my god still lives and there's a crisis at hand and the spirit of the lord came upon me jumped out there in the middle of the road with an ox goat in his hand now that's a stick with a little knob on it where they could punch the ox and make him plow and he jumped out there with this ox goat in his hand and beat down 600 philistines why because he knowed he was an israelite he had a right he had a right to god given rights he was circumcised we are circumcised today by the baptism of the holy ghost we have god-given rights i mean when the enemy comes along you know we could have an amazing media incredible camp then the philistines will come along try and steal your joy steal your victory but you have a right to actually say devil get off my inheritance in the name of jesus christ you have no right to steal the word of god from me it's mine hallelujah amen and any man that's been circumcised by the spirit of god that's born again any of you people that's sick the devil he's a bluff he'll rob you he'll power your cheeks he'll do everything he can but you don't have to stand for it no longer amen you say i'm not a preacher but you're a christian he didn't know how to fight you say i don't know nothing about faith step out anyhow he never seen it done before but he stepped out anyhow based on who he was amen that's why you've got to step out of faith take god's word step out in faith anyhow hallelujah amen i love the story of arnold von winkler of switzerland i love this story there came a point where the austrians had come in and the swiss decided they're going to fight and arnold von winkler the you know the story goes because the swiss weren't fighters they weren't for i mean they weren't professional soldiers are just farmers and they had their you know they had their size and their axes in their whatever they had whatever implements they had and they gathered together and they were facing a far greater force in themselves these were trained men you know they were fighting a trained military against rather but then there was a man who stepped forth arnold von winkler and he said swiss brethren this day i'll give my life to switzerland for the homeland he says what will you do the you know the people responded he said down in the valley yonder is a little lovely home where my wife and little children are waiting for me to come back but they'll never see me again for this day i shall give my life for my country you know jesus said i'll just stop here you know jesus says i sanctify myself as in john for for for the disciples sake he chose to live a sanctified life there's a lot of things he could have done but he decided just to let those things go and be sanctified to god for the disciples sake what if we had that in our hearts that we let selfishness go what we wanted to go we sanctify ourselves for each other's sake amen i sanctify myself father for my family's sake for my children's sake for my brother's sake for my sister's sake for the old one's sake for the young people's sake for the marriage sake for the single sake i for my way with love once sake lord i sanctify myself to your service you know there is nothing and all things are possible to them that believe brotherham said this untapped resources in god untapped there's actually parts of god that have not been tapped into i believe being stored up for this season i mean your prayer is unlimited you know if god you know if we really if we really could just it would anchor in our hearts the power of prayer i mean the prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah where the whole world's course can be changed because of your prayer you say well that's too well but this prophecy is going to be fulfilled yeah but you could change someone's life the eternal destination of someone could be changed because of your prayer prayer is not let's not limit god amen prayer is powerful prayer moves things prayer changes things the prophet said it'll move kingdoms it'll change the economics of the world holy it causes people to move from one place to another place from one side of the world to another part of the world hallelujah you know christine when we first started church here i'm going to pray for south africans i want south africans in church and he caused people to move from one part of the earth to the other part of the earth hallelujah to come here you think you think that didn't cause people to move how are we people who have moved hallelujah hallelujah and they just thought well maybe it's a good idea so no god was moving because of prayer amen i don't think that's too far-fetched you know god can do anything he wants to but let him pray it through you look he's looking remember he is the vine but we are the branches the branches bear the fruit the vine cannot bear fruit it cannot manifest its own life within itself it needs a branch to manifest its life within it right that's why i said lord i'm a branch manifest your glory through me even if even if you know because the greatest prayers are once told in secret and you know you could be a mighty prayer warrior great things are moving the reason the church is a success because of your prayers we say nothing about it but then on the other side when the testimony roll is opened up holy see the power of the prayers amen of the saints hallelujah amen prayer is very powerful if you want to get a burden for prayer there's a booklet out there saying a call for prayer it's made by um brother harold beckett it's just all quotes of the prophet about prayer that's very powerful amen now he says this okay every one of you um he says now what will you do they asked arnold von winkler he said now every one of you that's got weapons come follow me and do the best you can fight with what you've got do everything you can with what you've got to do with see sometimes we think we need a great big super weapon but fight with what you got i've just got a little bit of faith i'm weak in faith fight with that faith fight with what you've got amen and he screamed he threw up his weapon said make way for liberty and he started towards that army he went right towards the thickest of the spares and when he got he he got right down to where they was a hundred gleaming spears to catch him as he come he threw up his hands he'd make way for liberty he grabbed big armfuls of those spears and threw them into his chest and each one of those swiss soldiers followed behind him he broke the ranks of the enemy and they won a victory like has never been won before and today you can mention his name in switzerland and their eyes will color with tears and their cheeks will flush for their hero that was one of the greatest heroes to my opinion that's been an army life but it's just a minor thing just a minor thing one day the sons of adam were standing defeated law prophets and everything had failed every approach they had made had totally failed and yonder in glory there was one stepped out called the son of god and the angel said what will you do he said i'll go down and give my life and this day i'll redeem the fallen sons of adam and he came to calvary he went to the thickest of the spares he went through the valley of the shadow of death and caught every dart of the devil and pulled it into his own bosom and called for the church to to take what they've got and do the best you can praise god on the day of pentecost a russian mighty one fell out of the heavens above and armed every man with a weapon amen if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost fight with what you got hallelujah and today brethren that every man whatever you've got let's do the best we can with what we got and fight to the last man because the enemy lines broke amen christ defeated satan stripped him of everything he ever had and he's nothing today but a bluff when he tells you you can't have another old-fashioned holy ghost outpouring of the spirit we can have it today because the lions of the enemy is broke and god rules and reigns today hallelujah the lines of the enemy is still broke when he says you can't have joy the lion's enemy is broke just run through where the lion's been broken holly you can't have the holy ghost today yes you can i mean run through where the lines are being broken you can't have healing yes you can run through where the lines have been broken you can't have salvation yes you can run through where the enemies lines have been broken because god is still alive today he still rules and reigns today amen those lines have been broken fight with what you've got oh my faith is small don't worry about what you think about your faith i mean you put it to action and see what see how many devils are on the run because of the faith you already have hallelujah i need more faith just ask god but fight with what you've got amen amen why because we're living in victory we are standing the bride 2021 is victorious we're in a victorious condition amen he says hallelujah i'm glad for an old-fashioned holy ghost experience of the living god hallelujah [Music] amen now we read there about in john where our faith overcometh the world that's the victory we have now to have victory means you've won right victory never means defeat it means you've won you have fought a battle and one hallelujah but the thing is today is people will take the scripture and they'll look at the season we're in and say well but we're in a different season but the word applies for today just as it's just as alive and fresh as when it was first pinned down or first spoken yes amen and brother man says and faith is our victory so let's just let's just settle this through if you who's got revelation not human faith but god has had has given you the revelation of who he is right you've got revelation faith that is the victory that overcometh the world so we are not like one day we will be like those on the sea of glass praising god because we've gotten the victory but we can have that same victory dance right now because the faith we have received overcomes the world we're living in it overcomes it doesn't matter how big the enemy is the faith the revelation in you overcomes it you say john when he wrote that he didn't have my troubles he did not have to deal with the folk that i deal with he did not have to go through the things that i do that's right he may not had to deal with the same folk he may not had to have overcome the same thing but he never excluded them for he said this the faith is the victory that overcomes the world the whole thing how is it get faith in it right above it when we have the written word of god lying before us and the holy spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of the lord jesus with the divine promises written here that whatever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it what do we have to do then have faith not just floating faith not a make-believe faith but a real faith floating faith has no place it anchors on oh that's a good idea i think that's a nice thing that's floating faith or a make-believe faith is a mental faith but a real faith is a revelation you know it so you're not it's not i hope it is you know it now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't it just isn't a peacemaker so there's nothing in faith that makes peace with the devil he's not built g our god is a god of war he's a god of peace but he's a god of war and he's a mighty man of war haven't you ever watched the devil come against one of god's children that devil's got to contend with jesus christ our lord hallelujah amen it's just not in god to make peace with the devil so why would we make peace with him it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now why because you realize you're in victory above it i mean it means that you have to overcome it you are you've whipped it you're greater than it is oh i feel religious right now what was first a sinner or a savior a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin what was first the healer of sickness see it couldn't be a healer at least he was over the sickness it is the healer that conquers the sickness amen and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your creed not faith in some man but faith in jesus christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it's the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is the victory i still feel sick but faith is a victory oh it overcomes the world hallelujah so you can be in the middle of the greatest battle but you'll realize no the faith in me is going to has already overcome this amen this enemy though he fights me is going to be defeated hallelujah your brother makes a statement in the church book it is he says it is revelation it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil so when you realize when god reveals you that you are his son or daughter that gives you authority over the devil remember the devil wasn't as a fallen angel and angels are servants they are never they are never the family of god so they're always lower than the family of god now so so the devil being an angel that's fallen that means he got fired from his job right so now he's a fired servant who tries to think make you think he's greater than you but he's actually out of the economy of god he's not even part of the kingdom of god he's been kicked out he's been fired right so why would we let a fired servant try and have rulership over us we've got to realize that we have authority over the devil and you can see why they who add or take away from it will be cursed that's the book of revelation it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it's that simple there is nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen hallelujah now webster will tell us that prevailing means to defeat an opponent especially in a long or difficult contest now this in in in in human years the christian life can be a long and difficult contest because the devil's fighting us every day right but if we have the revelation of the word of who jesus christ is who we are in him then we have prevailing revelation and that prevailing revelation will cause us to conquer every enemy that comes against us because there's nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so the devil will try and prevail against you but he will end up defeated right and you'll prevail over him and you'll walk out packing the victory why because we're already in a victorious condition imagine going into a contest knowing you're going to win imagine that but then really the only challenge would be what what kind of margin can i win by do i want to win by one point we'll just take a game for example you know there's some you know like like in rugby or the sevens you know there's some team will face a team that's they don't even know why they're there like the all blacks will play i don't know who's not very good these days but or whoever's good or bad you know but there's such a margin of skill between the two teams now the one who's who's way better knows it's going to win it can't lose but then the challenge is how much can we win by why not go for a record why not because we're going to win we can't lose this thing these guys don't have the skill now if you take that and you take it into the spiritual realm and now our opponent is already defeated he's been stripped of all power right he's nothing but a bluff we are already victorious because the lord has made us victorious right well how much can we win by now do you want to have a close run thing where we just kind of we're going to win but you just want to win by one point but it wouldn't buy a thousand you want to hit a record or you know just have a mediocre time on the field no i think i think we should go for a record because christ has given us the victory so why not go for a record against the devil like no other believers have had in the history of the world amen because remember the lord has given us all things amen so why not press the battle until we receive all things you may think that's a bit of a crude illustration using a game but it is like that we've won if you've had your victory day and you've surrendered your whole life to the lord and he's the king of your life amen you know your sins are all washed away he sealed you into the kingdom by the holy ghost you've won you've won the game of life i think brother isaac is saying yo you've won the game of life but now how much do you want to win bye we have one life to live one life to give let's go for the top score hallelujah hey this is the final round we might as well knock out the devil we might as well just do a victory lap while we do it oh yeah not in some arrogant way no christians humble because it's our god that fights the battle if you know it's him fighting your battle you'll never be arrogant but if you think it's you and all you what you are you're well that's arrogancy but if you know it's god fighting the battle amen you'll always be humble because you know the prophet even said i don't want the lord to lift his hand off me just for a minute and uh i want to be the same way lord keep your hand on me may there be no way the devil can get into my life because i can't beat him i mean i need you in my life to beat him hallelujah no satan as i said in the beginning is more than a match the prophet said there's a contest between god and satan he says satan is more than a match for us we know that we know satan is way more of a match for any human being don't ever try and do it with your wisdom and outsmart him you can't do it jesus knew this pardon me so he said to the church so satan could not outsmart them a place to be fortified he sent them the holy ghost and the church does not claim to be smart they just claim to believe hallelujah now faith as i s um from that previous quote i was going to read a bit then we'll go but faith can't just be floating faith or make-believe faith it's got to be real faith now our faith cannot rest upon nothing i mean yet now our faith cannot rest upon nothing a christian has to have faith his faith has to have a solid resting place you know that and the only resting place that a christian a true born again christian can rest his faith or hers is upon the unmovable word of god it isn't built upon the shifting sands of man's theology and doctrines and upon some church affiliation but a true believer his faith arrests solidly unshifting as he approaches the word of god i was saying something somewhere maybe a few nights ago i wanted to preach so bad i preached to my wife in bed till about 12 o'clock just telling you how glorious jesus was a text came on my heart it kept burning in me so great till i couldn't rest with it i said honey i want to preach you a little while and she roused up by grace you listen i said the christian faith is solidly is based solely upon rest that's right a christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at calvary that's right oh sickness may come and disappointments but the christian is at rest knowing this that god is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks and there is neither sickness sorrow death there is neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that's in christ jesus we're at rest just let the old chip toss any way she wants to the anchor holds so the believer's life is based upon being in rest well how can you be in battle and be in rest at the same time easy you're resting because god is living through you fighting the battle but you're fighting the battle because you've got a devil that you want to defeat but you're resting you're not worried is this going to work is my faith going to hold out of course it will the faith that was in him is in you paul said the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god his faith cast out the devils out of legion his faith calmed the storm his faith brought lazarus from the grave his faith raised a dead boy who has been taken from burial his faith raised dries his daughter his faith amen fed the multitudes amen his faith took him to calvary his faith amen took him out of the grave because he says no man takes my life from me i lay it down i'll raise her back up again now that same faith is in you so if his faith held out and that faith is in you and i it'll hold see it's not whether we hold on to god or not it's whether he holds on to us hallelujah so how our christian experience should be based solely upon rest now the apostle paul would speak in hebrew as you say speaking hebrews 3 and 4 paralleling the journey of of of israel from egypt to the promised land he parallels it with the christian journey he says in in hebrews 4 verse 3 for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as i've sworn on my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works are finished from the foundation of the world for he spake at a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the sabbath um god did rest the seventh day from all of his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my arrest he says seeing therefore it remaineth that some of us must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again you i've got to put the scripture up so so we're in hebrews uh four i'm just finding a place you get a drink too but it's good if you can see it i think because really the condition of your life if everything troubles you so much are you in rest if you try and take care of the situation yourself are you in rest i've got to talk to this one about this and this and to maneuver this and political things and this and talk to this person gain advantage over this and fix this no is that rest no that's human manipulation that's not rest amen if we worry and fret so sure we should be burdened there's a difference between worrying and being burdened right because a burden worry is just human emotion and the devil's distracting you with worry and fear but a burden is god is going to do something and you express that burden in prayer right now where are we in verse seven here we are again he limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice heart and not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterwards have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore rest to the people of god for he that enters into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his so what does that mean it's not you trying to be the christian anymore it's him in you so you so you have ceased from your own works trying to please god your own self and now it's he living through you doing the works amen let us labor therefore to enter into that restless any man fall after the same example of unbelief now the rest we're talking about here is the true rest which is the baptism of the holy ghost right so i said if you've had your victory day and god's met you you've entered into rest you've won right he was saying gee um jesus was saying matthew 11 28 come unto me all you that labor in a heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i meek and lonely in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light isaiah would prophesy this rest coming in isaiah 28 and 11 time things are quick here he says for with stammering lips and another tongue he will speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear she says with stammering lips another time will he speak to this people on the day of pentecost when the day of pentecost fully come they're filled with the holy ghost what happened 120 people entered into rest and they walked out praising god staggering jabbering stammering the people thought they were drunk with new wine but what had happened is they had entered into rest they had entered into a true rest we know the sabbath day of of of keeping a day of the week that was just a shadow pointing to a reality because remember our rest is not if we keep a day no our rest the true sabbath is receiving the baptism of the holy ghost you enter into rest he was saying colossians 2 and 16 let no man therefore judge you in meter and drink or respect of a holy day or of the new moon of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ so those things are just shadows the reality is you really meet the lord amen what's happened you are now living in the sabbath every day your soul is in a sabbath condition in a rest amen and if you're in a if you've entered into that rest you're living in victory i hope you're not being wary about this let's just let's just wind this up he says in broken systems i've got a few more things to read in broken systems brother um says that the believer the inexhaustible fountain of life is jesus christ why and who is he the word the same the word the life the fountain the same yesterday today and forever the true believer it's his supreme joy his supreme life and his supreme satisfaction is in christ no pumping no pulling no joining no bailing just believing and resting that's what he is to the believing amen you're just believing and resting why is that because you're in rest because you know god is fighting your battles you have ceased from your own works and god is doing the works through you hallelujah there's a victorious life brother brown would say in the token paul said the life i now live this is from galatians 2 20 he's referring to he lived a different life from what he once did is not me but christ liveth in me that is the identified token that god required now the token is the holy ghost okay identification with our sacrifice the life of our savior in us the holy spirit he says oh what a positive token there cannot be any more token oh my if you could only catch the thought of it if i had power this morning with words to express and place into your souls not your ears but your soul the guarantee of it it makes you so relaxed if we and now he doesn't say get lax and loose but it makes you so relaxed why because you're on your way to heaven shouting victory your eternal destination has been secured amen you know where you're going you're not wondering if you're going to make it you've already made it hallelujah you've just got to catch up to where you're going to be amen why because our souls are sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost and to the day of our redemption amen so because of this it doesn't matter now what the world throws at you why because the revelation you have received overcomes the world it overcomes the faith you now have it overcomes every evil spirit whatever the enemy throws at you sickness the faith within you overcomes ladies and everything in it amen hallelujah now brother graham says here in in the summer and church age he says now be thou faithful unto death now wait i'll just stop here people diminish the faith they have they think well i just you know what does it mean to be you know and and the world has certainly diminished believing you know because everyone's name it and claim it and all these you know i believe but there's no change in the life and don't let those things diminish real faith people say well i just you know i'm just living my life and i'm just continuing on nothing seems to be happening no there's a faith at work if you've met the lord there's a faith at work he says be thou faithful unto death now this is from the sumerian church age he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yeah millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in christ jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarbs and all the martyrs the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour blessed be god forever amen to the same faith they had to go to the lion's den go to the colosseum and you'll be be torn to pieces or or torture whatever that same faith we have to overcome every day amen amen he says the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour you know we think often how on earth is this rapture really going to take place how's this body going to be changed the faith within you is going to change the body amen and why it's supreme grace i mean the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour because when you read through the scripture when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises the standard hallelujah and before any of those instances maybe the people would think how on earth is this going to happen you know you think moses he's been he's been anointed by god to go get israel out of egypt but then yeah he said how's this going to happen well god told me so i'm going there's been no record of red seas parting your rivers turning to blood your darkness and the death angel there's nothing of those happen but whenever the enemy came against that word that was going to be fulfilled god anointed moses to overcome so he gave god gave us a uh god gave a supreme grace for a supreme hour joshua going around jericho no record of it ever happening before but when the enemy sealed up the city like that god gave a supreme grace for that supreme hour and you take that all the way through the scriptures and now in this end time where the world is so dark and fallen apart god will give a supreme grace for this supreme hour amen hallelujah so we can rest on that knowing that god has our lives in his hands hallelujah amen amen now i'll just finish with the we have authority by god's word to get angry with the devil god gives us a victory we got it now this is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith now i'm going to read this and i'm done what is it not them people the headship in the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they're one godless church is one christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed the reason he's called jesus he's the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proving manifested god like that body did and that body redeemed every bit of this these bodies and through their god works his threefold manifestation going to the kingdom risen paid the price we're redeemed god has proved it vindicated at sea and we stand justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he already judged that body speaking of the lord on the cross and which i'm part of oh how am i part of it here it is it's in me if you abide in me and my words in you amen then what you say ask the father anything of my name it'll be done there it is gloria justified glory to god oh if i could get the world to see that wine there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are the proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory it shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right we're bound right we're already potentially raised because we're raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of an eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself like that here that is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word comes down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that's the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down to the body down into the body vindicating they are one the husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life is life spirit of a spirit see amen how do you know it it bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs things that i do you shall do also oh hallelujah my hello we are his victory amen he is manifesting his victory through us amen so if that's the case we are living in victory that's the position you're in today amen i'm going to finish there after if the musicians could come this morning but friends i trust you can realize we don't have to if you're a real believer you don't have to pray to get victory you've got you're in victory hallelujah and now just let that victory manifest out of you but if you haven't had that time where you've really wrestled with the angel and he has changed your nature and changed your being why don't you wrestle with them out this morning let him take your life and change you that your walk is different your talk is different your dress is different once you the things you used to do you do them no more because the lord has touched you and changed your life amen i trust you're standing in victory this morning in spite of everything that's going on around you i mean you're victorious because the victorious one is in you hallelujah amen let's um let's stand to
