love with all our hearts we thank you Lord for this privilege to serve you in this life and Jesus Christ's name we thank you for it thank you amen amen amen Thank You musicians I mean praise the Lord hallelujah amen it's good to see everyone out tonight amen if you got your Bibles handle it let's just go to it's got a first first John sort of read a couple of scriptures one from we're just going to stay in the ball just for the opening scriptures will stay in the book of first John and if we just go to chapter two and we'll read verse 27 and these are these are familiar scriptures I'm sure but it says now but the anointing which ye have received a femme abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and there's no lie and even as it hath taught you a chela at it has taught you you shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear you may have confidence and not being ashamed before him at his coming and then let's just go to first John chapter 5 and will read from Justin verse 1 so whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth them that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love that that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments well this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his commandments are not Grievous for who so what for whatsoever sorry is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God I mean may the lord blesses would you you may be seated I want to I want to just speak tonight a little bit on on overcoming and I just want to take a thought from I thought from the church age book you I've been reading in the Smyrna church age and brother bran begins to speak about faith and there's a there's a scripture to that church age about be thou faithful unto death and then brother Brown would speak about now he does not so be there faithful unto death he does not say he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands J millions have died all the ages they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful murder they held not their lives dear unto death often we think it would be impossible to be a martyr yeah because we think of you you read who drew the foxes Book of Martyrs you know and you and you hear the great you read the great testimonies of those who who gave their lives willingly and they were tortured and our persecuted that tormented and you know burnt at the stake and you know you know all kinds of horrible things of them yet they gladly rejoice in the in the giving their lives in that way now often we would think that would be almost impossible to be a murder but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus as the same faith that upholds the poly cups and all the murders the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the Supreme our blessed be God forever amen so he says he says very simply says the same faith that we have will help will cause us to overcome as they overcame event so when we think of the martyrs we think it would be incredible to you know I don't know if I could you know if I could give my life and and and be tortured like like they did but we forget and I'm just basically rehashing what he said but we forget that the if you have the faith of the Son of God in you amen if you have the same if you have faith in you whatever the challenge comes your way you'll overcome it I mean that's why he says that the you know but we but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus as the same faith that upholds the poly cups and all the martyrs so we must rejoice in the fact that we have what we need to overcome the sage amen you know we we see in the book of Acts that there was an anointing that was released you know you're an axe chapter 2 and that anointing you know if you if you go from Genesis even down into this a that anointing upon the children of God has caused them to overcome amen it has caused them to overcome it doesn't matter if they were if they were they had to give their lives as martyrs it doesn't even matter if they had to maybe die of sickness because you know even Elijah Elijah died of sickness he had a double portion of the spirit that was on Elijah but it says in the scripture that that that he he became sick and he died from that sickness but he didn't die in unbelief amen he died in faith and it's a great victory for someone because many times you know we can get it so badly wrong where maybe a a saint has been you know you know cancer has has has jumped on them and many believers are healed of cancer but some are not I meant but it doesn't mean that the ones that die with cancer have any less faith in the ones that are healed because faith to overcome as faith that causes you to believe in spite of your circumstance Amen it causes you because the challenges we have in life are not or if will be healed if we will be delivered as that can you believe in every circumstance I mean can you hold on to God's unchanging hand in every circumstance because if you can hold on to God's unchanging hand in every circumstance then you're overcoming amen and that is the that is the great challenge that we face is that can we overcome this age amen now we talk about great big lofty things as the beast and the world powers and the end and everything the Antichrist is doing sure those things are there but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of life and how how that that enemy demon power 19 comes down and tries to affect you can you overcome it on that level Amen because you don't have to go storm the Vatican and and wipe them all out or do some great thing like that that's not what we call to do we are called to live a rugged life every day day in day out amen sent it on the centered on the face of the son of God amen but you must understand that the reason I read that scripture in first John to the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and so the anointing that the bride has doesn't just come upon the months in a while but the anointing that's in them as Christ himself coming and dwelling in your soul a mint and then when when faith is when when the enemy comes to challenge your faith then the then God steps to the battlefront amen it's like brother bear I'm the greatest trial he had in his life was when his first wife hope was dead and then his little Sharon Rose was there on the you know you know dying in the hospital and heap rates you know prayed with all this heart for both of them and then when she was dying you know he was saying God don't take my baby and then the devil came along because remember when he started to pray for just saw a black sheet fall down and you God just refused to hear his prints and then another devil came along devil saying I thought you said he was a good God you know I thought you yo yo yo I thought you see there's a healer and all these different things and then now so here's the greatest crisis of his life and he's come down coming down to a decision yeah because it's where the rubber hits the road Andy and he says I was just about to agree because the devil said to him what have you done you know you've given your life and after you work you go and preach on the street corners you go pray for people you just burn both you know the candle are both in so to speak and look what it's got you he says I was just about to agree but then something on the inside the inside came up and he says honey I'll bury you in the arms of mother which is basically i'm going to put your coffin on you know on top of hers this is the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and that was as great that was the great trial of his faith at that time was it wasn't you know because even says the devil couldn't tell him that God wasn't real it does he really cared as I really love you as it knows you really this good god do you speak about but it was a CD was just about to agree and that's why it's such an incredible thing where this thing can be totally contrary the devil can twist you around who's been there I've been there a few times recently the devil can twist this around but then something on the inside comes out amen and and the man on the inside the inside comes to the battlefront and defeats what Satan is doing a min and that is how you overcome earlier because the anointing which you have received of him abideth in You amen there's a lot of you know I said and I see the book of Acts anointing was was released of God himself putting on human flesh of his redeemed children the Antichrist anointing was released as well in that day and so the two powers were working down through the church but then we have come down to this time and the challenge is because we think sometimes we belittle because you're the reason that jumped out to me about the monitors murders as many times we we belittle what we possess amen because we help hold the martyrs and very high regard and I believe we should incredible worries of faith I'm in which had they didn't have what we have you know they were just plowing along for God not they're not you know they don't have the light that we walk in but sometimes we can belittle what we have and what God has done for us amen we can actually say well I'm just uh I'm just I'm just struggling through you know this lady I see in church age and I'm just going to make it we're not just going to be survivors I mean we're going to be overcomers and you must understand that you know the the anointing the believers of a certain age could only do what the anointing was given for that age a mint so in the days of the book of Acts with the first church that church was called the ephesian church because it aimed at the high quality in Christ but then it relaxed amen that's one of your emphasis means aimed at but relaxed so aimed at the high colleague they had the Holy Ghost but they ended the high calling but then the age began to drift and it began to actually aim towards the Dark Ages where the church was dead and buried underground and the truth was virtually smothered out so they could only they could only live according to what the anointing was to do because they were the first church it wasn't a harvest but there was a quick maturity of the believers but they were actually that was a manifestation to be planted in the ground in the dark ages amen because it was there maybe forgive me if I'm using too much terminology but remember we are wheat we are the harvest a mint so there has been a harvest there has been wheat planted 47 church ages there's been a harvest right but the first church wasn't a harvester terms of taking them into a rapture but the first church had to died and gone to the ground and then come forth again the church had to amen you following me because you see it's it's a harvest I mean I mean it's seed that seed has to be planted if it's play that will bring forth much fruit Amen Jesus spake of bad about himself but you can also see through the church ages that same principle happened so they had to be instead of them going in a rapture because remember when Paul was saying we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those which are dead in Christ but they'll rise first and we were trial on rent we caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air when he said we which are alive and remain he was writing thinking well as God riding through him thinking that it was we if I was here possible I'd be saying we which are alive and remain so he was believing that they was a group that were going to be there live and remaining ones but that was for us down two thousand years down the road so that first church was aiming at the high calling in Christ they were sealed in because member every age were sealed ins I'm not saying the unbelievers make believers what they were real believers but they couldn't live above what God was anoint the church to do at that time they had to a mat and relax and then gone to the ground eventually and I now as that is the principle in the first stage and you can see the you know we understand that there's been four anointings down through the church has been the line anointing which which is to combat the Antichrist writing forth and then after that when the Antichrist power went from deception so then it finally had had a political power behind it and they could use government with the sword to kill the Christians amen when when the Antichrist went from a deception writing forth so now was the red horse rider with a two-engine sword and that was a time where now the government was behind the false Church and they used a false I mean the false Church used the government to persecute the Christians and so it was a state-sponsored persecution and so the believers and that they were anointed by an ox anointing same Holy Ghost but in a different way and they are anointed and an ox is a beast of sacrifice yep so that's why they could give themselves willingly and joyfully and suffer the great death that they suffered is because they are anointed by an ox anointing amen so they could only live according to the anointing that was given to them I meant they couldn't do anything else are you following me and it's the same thing now when when when Martin Luther came the Reformation came and the anointing of man's wisdom came upon the church and there was great gifted men who knew a lot of languages and all these kind of things is because now but the church could only really operate under that anointing amen and then now you come down to down into our age where where the Prophet tells us when the seals were open the Eagle begins to Firefly so the anointing on the church changes from a man's wisdom anointing amen to now an eagle anointing I mean where there's a people that'll lift it up off the earth amen they can actually saw in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I mean that they can see now what the enemies do it you know what the enemies do it I'm and we can see him a far off amen we can see what he's trying to do and we can see it by the scripture I mean that's why the book of Revelation really is the bride's book Amen because it shows us not only where we are and where we're going but it shows what the enemy is and where he's going I mean so now there's an anointing come upon the church that we can see these things and it's not you know it's the anointing which we have received abideth in you and you need not that any man teaches you but he shall teach you well how does that work because there's because there's teachers in the body well someone will stand and they'll preacher they'll teach and there will be a witness in your heart saying that is true and that and the spirit in you will really put the wood together because ultimately it's just words coming out yep but if the anointing is not here to catch that and put it together then it just sits up here amen that's why you need it so that's why the anointing needs to be on both ends amen so now there's that eagle so so the Holy Ghost and this is why believers we can be we can be maybe you're the devil can try and lay a hold but there comes a time with something and use is now that's him amen because he'll try and trap you with all kinds of things but the Bride of Christ can never be completely entangled again amen amen now so the so the anointing we have received as this Eagle anointing which is that you know and that's why the church you see will Dwight the bright operates differently to how man man aged church used to operate amen that's why it's no more this is my territory this is your territory you stay out of my city this is my you know because that's all man's kind of thinking I mean that's why the breaking come together and it doesn't matter who's there or who's preaching or whatever more that's the same spirit all around the world and they just come in come all into harmony amen because we don't think you know geographic Lee in this well this person's from the Congo and this person's I'd rather listen to someone from America or something yo we don't think that way anymore I trust you don't I meant because it because it's God the same God in the congos the same God in America the same God in New Zealand or whatever country you want to put there and so we can work with other parts of the body amen if the anointing the same anointing that's an us is an M then we can work together and it's not a big guy and a small them or a big demand a small light whatever more the body just all comes together I met under the great headship of the Lord Himself but you see now we cannot live now the reason I said about the former aegis is because the believers you cannot live any other way than what the anointing you have upon you amen so as the first age had to die and go on to the ground the believers in the last stage do not they cannot die and go on to the ground I meant the believers in the last age cannot aim at the high calling in Christ relax and then slide down they have to cause the anointing that's in you you have to aim at the high calling in Christ not your own human ability but there's something in you that's not you pushing you on I met remember this is not if if there's any human instrumentality in your walk but what am I using Wizzle I'm saying if if there's any of you putting your own and put into your Christian walk it is not a Christian walk amen it has to be God and God alone remember you are his workmanship it is not a partnership between you and God saying how we're going to get this going to a rapture amen you are who's the Potter he's the Potter who's the clay you're the clay i mean the the clayton say to the pot of well I think my handle should be this way and I don't really want to be a I want to be a jug I don't want to be a bowl I don't want to be a plane I want to be this the clay doesn't say that to the Potter I mean the clay just yields itself Amy to the potter and the potter makes the claim to what the potter wants it to be and it's the same thing with you and i that's why i may sound ridiculous but I want to say yo it's not a partnership between you and God you yield your members to him and then he does what he wants to do amen and that is the only way member he is the author and the finisher of our faith amen as I see you on Sunday a perfect strength of perfect weakness we have to master human ability amen and that mastering is the realization you your human ability cannot do it amen now don't turn that and took into an excuse poses because God just got angry at Moses I can't speak I have nothing to say they won't hear me you know whatever yo yo has seven excuses whatever it was at the burning bush Moses I mean God didn't say it's all right Moses it's ok we'll be fine he just got angry at him Amen because God wanted Moses to realize I've commissioned you I've heard the cries of our people I have come down and I'm sending you I will deliver them i'm sending you you read nix this chapter 3 and so now Moses was trying to bring his human his he was trying to bring what he thought was human weakness and he thought that human weaknesses I can't do the job because of these amen so don't use what you perceive is your weaknesses as excuses amen because God called Moses God then this was God's evaluation of Moses I put the office of a profit in this man he is going to be my mouthpiece I'm going to bring my word through this man i'm going to use him as an instrument to be a serpent bruiser as a shadow amen I'm going to bring my people out of bondage and I'm going to take them to the promised land that was God qualifying Moses a mint and it's the same with you amen I put a previous age seat in my bride Amen I've called them by my name they are mine I'm going to make them in my image Amen they already have what they end they already have in them the power to overcome I just got to bring it to life amen and so we shouldn't say oh Lord I can't speak I can't do this I can't do this just just put that to one side you know perfect strength and perfect weakness is actually really perfect strength is imperfect surrender if you go under the swimmers what he's really talking about and so we cannot live we have can only live by the anointing that we have been given every church age the interpret a time now I may be jumping around but I'm actually speaking on something when you read the seven churches the interpretation of those passages you go see in history yeah see see the ephesian church age you can go read the church history or you know all of them you can hear about you know you can go read about Martin Luther and the Reformation that's the saddest you change amen so the lives that they lived was an interpretation of that church age yep you following me and so now they the life that they lived interpretate was the interpretation of the scripture and so the life that is lived by the Bride of Christ is the interpretation of the bright age amen it is the interpretation of the bride age and we have to understand that when it comes to maturity brother brad says the shock has pulled away and it has all the grain needs to do is lay in the presence of the Sun amen because what often happens is when we think about well am I mature enough who's had those thoughts am I mature enough am I am I really am i growing like the rest of the crop now if you have those thoughts you're trying to work in partnership with God Amen because now you're thinking now I need to put some human ability into this because if people think well I'm not where I should be I'm not mature like I think I should be mature they're thinking now i need to put him human effort into this but the secret is the shock has pulled away the wheat just needs to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen amen what does that what is the Prince of the Sun it's not natural sunlight it's spiritual sunlight amen so when so when we have services or we listen to the word or we pray and God comes what does that now sunlight amen at sunlight had it had it Moses become become root so he was royalty in Egypt and I've said this many times I want you to really think about different way he was royalty in Egypt rim yep the royalty in Egypt consider themselves God's the pharaohs were considered gods in go see it in history so if he was he was going to be the next Pharaoh he would have considered himself a god yep so how did he go and now if someone thinks that you know especially in those days if they think there are God they don't walk around humbly they have a persona they have a you know they walk around like they own the place and the Pharaohs did well that's what they thought how did he go from that to becoming the meekest man in all the earth amen because before the burning bush he wasn't mature amen after the burning bush after Mount Sinai he is very mature because maturity is shown by the character of God and you amen how did he go from that to that he lay in the presence of the Sun amen how'd he land the prisoners on his I Mount Sinai is it the burning bush God came and spoke to him it wasn't Moses is choosing amen at what Mel I'm just just trying to what what does that mean I just sit there and don't do anything know if you love him you want to spend time with them even if you're just driving and talk here in the shopping you're in the supermarket you can talk way to God in your heart or you know go around your daily business you can talk to him you can pray you know you can sing you know Psalms and songs in your heart that's communing with God amen so we shouldn't always get in our mind we have to you know literally well this is my prayer seat and this is where I listen and this is how long I listen all those things are good discipline nothing wrong with discipline but if we restrict God to working in just that Amen will actually miss the rest of the day I need to spend time and he says I'm never leave you nor forsake you amen and so Moses Moses went member it wasn't his choosing he he knew his men to be the delivery but he failed but every time God came to Moses I believe that was God's choosing amen she'll this your night to mean old your night to you but ultimately is God's choosing when he comes amen and so Moses was in the presence of the Sun and he ripened amen and the first five books of the Bible were a revelation to him amen but because he was in the prince of the Sun that would came to him but it became a revelation and that was shown because he became the meekest man in all the earth yeah but but that's what brother and says all we need to do now is lay in the presence of the Sun and it's the sun's work it's not the grains ability in itself to ripen I mean it is the conditions the grain is in amen you take natural that's why Jesus spoke about natural natural parables brother Bram did too because if you look at a grain crop why do some why do some grain harvests a bumper harvests why do some harvest fail it's not the grains fault it's the conditions the greens room Amen if it's sunny and then and the soil moistures right the temperature and all those things are right can you ever bumper harvest a min if it's if it's if it's terrible weather and the worst whatever can do worse season there is you get virtually no harvest it's not the grains fault it's the conditions amen amen well Lord you say well how do you well then you say well I want the conditions to be right amen if you love him I trust I'm not going out on a limb but if you love him you want to spend time with them i said thats everywhere all the time amen so we have to think about everyday things but you shouldn't let that consume you that's all now I've got to think about God now I mean I'm just trying to find a balance here but you understand what I mean amen but if we want to be mature remember what God that's what God views is maturity it's not our self-evaluation amen because it's not the clay that evaluates itself now I'm a pot well now I just need a handle or now I just need a spout or I need a bit of detail around the room to look pretty amen it's not us self evaluating ourselves saying well am i there yet God will have us here when he wants us there amen if he started to work when he finish your work amen remember we cannot live any different now I wonder supper I just want this too I just want you to ponder over these things we cannot we cannot live when he live any definitely only by the anointing that this age is received yeah so they aimed at member let's just go to Ephesians chapter 4 and this just read this because sometimes you know we we can look into the description I know I sometimes do and I just really thought about it this week we look at oh how can we you know we look at the promise but then we think how can we ever obtain the promise but what happens is normally is that a promise is thrown out there and then it's by faith we possess the promise amen but you have to know the promise is there because if you don't know the promises there you'll never buy face say lord thank you it's mine I meant just like the promised land if they didn't know what was in the promised land of the promised land was there there's lights would never you know God amen you know they had to be spies to go this is what the lands like well let's go get it you understand it has to be projected in front of you God puts forth something yep and then he puts that forth because now he's saying I want you to step into this amen he says now is the season and that's the reason he puts it forces because he wants you to walk in it they meant just like thee just like Israel are you following me amen Israel God sends Moses now you're going into the Promised Land or now it's time we've been waiting four hundred years for these things and the reason he's hitting Moses to say now as the seasons because he wanted them and the promised land amen now remember this is the book of Ephesians so this is to thee and not you know just to save time these believers were sealed unto the day of their Redemption so they were believers okay they had the Holy Ghost but now if we read from it's just read from verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some profits and some evangelists and some pasta some teachers for the perfecting of the saints which is a maturing or completeness of the saints not this is not spiritual perfect I mean this is not sinless perfection the blood of Jesus Christ makes us perfect sinless Lee this is speaking this perfection is a maturing a meant for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man until the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ there we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body gently a jointly sorry body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body until the edifying of itself and love so Paul is projecting this is the land we have to go possess we've come here you've been sealed unto the day of your redemption you're in the promised land yep but now we have to go from here and then we have to grow into the fullness of the statue of Christ so but remember they did not fully possess the inheritance because if they did there would have been a body change of rapture amen so there was a there was a portion there is a portion of it that they could not fulfill because they had to be seven Church ages yeah but they are anointed and they could not take the land because there are seven Church ages but now likewise we are anointed but because we're not anointed just a man in to relax were anointed that we have to go in and possess all things amen we have to live out this part of the work you understand we have come to a season where the bride has to fully possess everything God has for them it's like when Joshua bought the people into the land they didn't fully possess the promised land doesn't that right but then when David came upon the throne then they fully possess the promised land yep so there was a season where they aimed at it but they couldn't possess it but then when David came they didn't just aim at it but they possessed it amen and they couldn't do anything to do that under the kingship of David they had to fully possess the land they couldn't live any other way yeah and it's the same thing in this day we cannot know this is not just nice ideas amen we have to the believers in this day they must possess everything God has released to them amen so these things that will promise the Ephesians but they didn't they didn't obtain it the bride has to obtain yes and now the reason they say well that's a bit daunting how can I ever grow into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by faith amen by the anointing you have received you will grow into them you can't do anything else I mean the bride can't do anything else it has to grow into the floors of the statue of Christ and so if that is the case now then just by faith thank god you're on your way they meant because I said it is not human ability or now I need to be more like Jesus and then if you if you go down a work throat you just end up legislating yourself by your perceived failures you must never do that amen just walk with God lay in the Prince of the Sun amen and you'll mature amen is it really that simple yet us as we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another ice in God and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all sin first shot first John 17 amen but then also as you walk in the light the light ripens the green amen so as the as the bride walks with Christ you mature amen I'm just trying to hopefully I just take a better self ability load off here today amen just rest in him and walk with Him amen oh but the rapture may happen and I don't feel like I'm mature God will get you there just walk with god and if some people are having a glorious time and you don't seem to be feeling it just walk with God and if you're having a glorious time and no one else is feeling it just walk with God amen enough urine and the in-between time just walk with God Amen because remember it's not you the church in God it is you and God amen and every member i trust every believer that comes into this place it is them in god and it should always be that way it's not us as a body in him and by association we walk with them no it's not it's not their weights an individual fits you and God amen and as you walk with Him you will mature amen and now you say well what is that got to do with overcoming if you walk with him whoever is born of God overcometh the world yeah so those I think we should just order a Joyce from that one scripture whoever is born of God overcometh the world doesn't maybe overcome or attempts to remember overcome mr. wrestle with and get the victory they meant so whoever is born of God overcomes the world what does that mean believer verse world equals well defeated believer overcome amen that's the what happened in this war the believer overcame how they overcome because our born of God amen amen it is not you know as I see it you just got to take the scripture for that says I'm going to try and close on this for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world amen can I say it one more time should we say it together for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world amen who is born of God that means you overcome the world amen amen hallelujah and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen so your faith gives you victory amen but if you're born of God you have to overcome the world this is what we just read I can't you just make it sound a lot more exciting it is what it is amen if you are if you're born of God you overcome the world it's not a few born of God you fail and are defeated in this age or you just survive this age no you overcome the safe wrestle that means you're wrestle Worth and you get the victory amen and overcometh it means it's a it's past tense Amen overcometh is past tense yeah overcometh it's done it's not overcoming the world present or shall overcome it's overcomer if my King James English is correct that is isn't it past tense yeah okay they have overcome yo they overcome a thought do it it's done amen because if you're born of God you cannot become unborn of God I need some musicians to come otherwise we'll be here too long but you could understand you cannot you cannot be unborn you get born again but you cannot go from being born again to become unborn amen you can't it's impossible amen you understand so if you've been born of God for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world I think that is actually present in sorry but it's finished amen obviously my my King James English isn't that good but it is what it is amen so put that on your fridge say put that scripture on your frigid and say I have been born of God that means I overcome amen and that is the victory even our faith many times we yeah well we fight battles all kinds of things all the time but you got to remember my faith because if you're born again it is not your human faith operating as a faith of the Son of God in you amen so it's his faith in you operating you understand so that means it doesn't matter come what may is that faith as in you and that faith will cause you to overcome Amen Alleluia let's just sing faith turns the night into the day amen is it okay the bride has to overcome because we can't do anything else the bride has to take a rapture cuz she can't do anything else amen the bride has to walk out victorious because we can't do anything else because that's the anointing that's upon us I'm malicious sickness faith turns a night into the day love drives a doubts and fears away and now my heart is singing Oh with the door bells ringing all this to the peeling of its cars for faith wins the victory every time Oh hallelujah what a savior and just to know that he is mine Oh faith turns a night into the day oh I'm price of doubts and fears away oh now my heart is singing Oh with the joy bells ringing all it to the peeling love is charm Oh paint wins the victory every time Oh hallelujah what a savior and Justin oh there he is hi just one more time oh hey turns and I'd it to the day love rods and I'll send fear away oh now my heart is with your belfry all this to the feeling of God and faith where's the victory every time Oh hallelujah what a savior and God's and all that he ha allu you so I becometh as a verb it means to subdue literally or figuratively to conquer to overcome to prevail to get the victory amen Amy do not belittle what you have amen amen as he said I just want to read that again he says but did see often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a murder but there to recall that the faith we use that we daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the poly cups and all the martyrs the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the Supreme our blessed be God forever amen amen so so whatever challenge remember whatever the enemy tried to do through the ages the faith and the believers caused them to overcome amen so whatever the challenge comes against you the faith in you will cause you to overcome Amen hallelujah Amen let's just um it's just closing a word of Prayer shall we gracious Lord we thank you Father that whatever is born of you overcometh the world and father we're being

father because we know if we walk with you were laying in the Prince of the Sun and that's what you're prophesied all the grain needs to do now is lay in the Prince of the Sun to ripen and that's where we are Lord may we just keep walking with you just loving you father just help us to keep our eyes focused upon you and may we not get worried about what we may think is impossible but father

ourselves to you and walk with you Lord because you are one molding and shaping us into your very image and father may the words of our mouth the meditations of our heart always be acceptable in thy sight O Lord fathers may we always think upon you and wherever we go every day may we just pray to you and talk to you and sing to you Lord father made granted for your glory we thank you Lord that we have received faith to overcome us H Lord and we're not just going to scrape through Lord and at the end say I survived lady hacia but we are going to triumph over this age we're going to get the
