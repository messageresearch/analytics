[41:29] I'm not unto thee that if thou wouldest
[41:31] believe thou should have see the glory
[41:33] of God then they took away the stone

[41:38] and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
[41:40] father I thank thee that thou has heard
[41:42] me and I knew that thou hearest me
[41:45] always but because of the people which

[44:37] also we're having communion foot washing
[44:39] at 5 p.m. today as well I want to I want
[44:42] to speak about rolling the stone away
[44:44] you know y'all want to continue from
[44:47] from where I was speaking speaking last
[44:49] last Sunday how you know the yeah it's
[44:52] gonna recap really quite briefly but you
[44:55] know there was a death Lazarus Lazarus
[44:57] was taken for Mary and Martha's house
[44:59] and we know the devil was to rob us of
[45:01] what we have of our joy our peace our
[45:03] love our victory and the Holy Ghost and
[45:05] you know I mean and then the juice came
[45:07] along as comforters and the devil comes
[45:09] along after he stolen something from me
[45:11] then he then he comes along and wants to
[45:13] keep you in an atmosphere of unbelief
[45:15] and self-doubt and pity party and you
[45:17] know just inwardly looking downward cast
[45:19] eyes and you know and and and and they
[45:22] they created that atmosphere in the
[45:23] house but then Jesus came because we
[45:26] know when when Lazarus was getting sick
[45:28] the resurrection and the life was on his
[45:30] way to their house Amen it's the same
[45:33] thing with us you know the devil wants
[45:35] to rob us of everything you know he
[45:36] wants to take everything from us he just
[45:39] wants us basically just to exist in life
[45:40] but you know there's something about
[45:42] life it cannot be contained you know and
[45:45] I'm talking about eternal life you know
[45:46] we know natural life yo the other world
[45:49] Trust it puts us in a box and makes us
[45:50] to conform to some image and just
[45:52] basically fit their mold but we know
[45:55] that we're not called to fit the world's
[45:56] mold we're called to fit the mold of the
[45:58] word I mean we're where we would be
[46:00] conformed to him as his image I mean the
[46:02] image of the word so you know so natural
[46:05] life we know it can be contained to some
[46:07] extent but eternal life cannot be
[46:09] contained
[46:10] you know something about life it expands
[46:12] it grows that your it increases that
[46:13] matures it gets better I mean and and we
[46:16] know eternal life cannot diminish it
[46:18] cannot get less it cannot you know weak
[46:20] and it cannot pull back but it expands
[46:22] it grows it gets greater is the same
[46:24] thing with our Christian walk I mean it
[46:26] gets greater every day it gets better it
[46:28] gets richer I trust that's your
[46:30] experience I mean it's not just a common
[46:32] story of our Jesus died one day for my
[46:34] sin and isn't that wonderful but it's a
[46:36] it's a lie
[46:37] it's wonderful it means more to you now
[46:39] that when you first met him I'm in the
[46:41] resurrection a holy I'm coming out of
[46:43] the tomb that means more to you now than
[46:46] it did when you first heard it I mean
[46:48] there's not just a story but it's a
[46:49] living reality everybody you know
[46:51] because he rose out of the grave you
[46:53] have risen as well earlier because
[46:55] you're his body upon the earth
[46:56] hallelujah and if the head has risen the
[46:58] body must rise as well hallelujah
[47:01] brother Brahim sees in Christ and
[47:03] mystery God revealed he says his body
[47:05] was not held in the grave recognized
[47:09] with him in the resurrection same as he
[47:11] is now he says less than what means this
[47:13] his word which he is has been begin to
[47:17] be risen the word that down through the
[47:20] age of Luther Wesley see has begin to
[47:23] raise up to its power there it begin to
[47:25] move and when it moved a little more now
[47:28] it's coming up to a identification see
[47:31] now watch now it's the life and the body
[47:33] is a vindication that the raptures at
[47:35] hand when you see the headship and the
[47:38] body becoming one and the fullness of
[47:40] the measure of his manifestation shows
[47:42] that the body is about to be received to
[47:45] the headship so he says that the very
[47:48] proof that the rapture is at hand is
[47:50] that God's life is and his people
[47:52] I meant God is now tabernacled in human
[47:55] flesh hallelujah so now is aces when it
[47:57] comes to the full measure of his
[47:59] manifestation now we know that you know
[48:02] as Christ was the second Adam there must
[48:05] be a second Eva must him be a redeemed
[48:07] woman and we know that that speaks of
[48:09] the church amen so as he was the
[48:11] fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man
[48:14] now as the fullness of the Godhead
[48:15] bodily in a people hallelujah so that so
[48:18] that's why the body needs every part
[48:19] every joint supplieth every need I mean
[48:22] because he's a part of God and meat is
[48:24] the word and meat is the word in you
[48:25] when the word comes together then it can
[48:27] manifest or a multi-member body
[48:30] hallelujah I mentioned now you know to
[48:33] me it's so wonderful hallelujah he's
[48:35] alive holy and it's not just a
[48:38] historical fact he's alive I've made him
[48:40] in this day I mean he's not a God of
[48:42] history he's a God of the present amen
[48:44] he stepped out of history to me
[48:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:49] I'm simple it just makes me happy you
[48:52] know I'm glad he's not just a story or
[48:54] just a nice idea he's a living reality I
[48:57] mean so now we see that the you know the
[48:59] churches begin to rise in its power that
[49:01] you know we're not a downtrodden people
[49:03] no more I mean but the eyes of
[49:05] understanding have become enlightened
[49:06] he's opened our spiritual understanding
[49:09] I mean that we know that we're not just
[49:10] your trading on thin ice maybe we'll
[49:12] make it maybe we won't but we have a
[49:14] full assurance this morning
[49:16] amen that were being sealed into the
[49:18] kingdom by His Holy Spirit it is
[49:20] grieving not the Holy Ghost work by
[49:21] we're by your seal to the day of your
[49:23] redemption hallelujah so we have an
[49:25] assurance if you have met him you've met
[49:26] him and there's a purpose that he called
[49:29] you I mean that you'd become one with
[49:30] him and he cannot lose a part of himself
[49:33] hallelujah no I I'm just wanting to put
[49:37] these things out because we got to get
[49:39] to Mary Martha rolling the stone away
[49:41] okay so but you know it's such a
[49:44] wonderful it's such a wonderful realize
[49:47] and it's not in here it's in here to
[49:50] recognize that we have passed from death
[49:51] to life
[49:52] you know the sin questions been settled
[49:55] I mean the son questions been settled
[49:57] you know and what is that question have
[49:59] I been cleansed is there something that
[50:01] can cleanse me that I can gone to the
[50:03] prints of a holy God and not be
[50:05] condemned because you know only those
[50:07] without sin can enter into heaven
[50:08] hallelujah so now there's that question
[50:10] that we're all born with what can
[50:12] actually cleanse me can change me and
[50:14] mold me take my sin away that I'm born
[50:16] with my fallen nature that I'm born with
[50:18] what can change me to remove that that I
[50:20] can go to heaven now people do all kinds
[50:23] of things they try and reform themselves
[50:25] they try and you know oh but your
[50:26] alternative new page your new years and
[50:28] then then in a second and Jeff January
[50:30] it's turned back because they can't keep
[50:32] it there
[50:32] they make vows they you know you're they
[50:34] try and do all kinds of things but if
[50:36] the nature of the man has not changed
[50:38] then we will fall back into the same rut
[50:40] we kept tried to dig ourselves out of
[50:42] hallelujah so you know that's just how
[50:45] man is but I'm so thankful that that we
[50:48] have a perfect lamb we have something
[50:50] that's tangible that's real a faith a
[50:52] word that's real that can change us you
[50:55] know I'm just I'm just glad because you
[50:58] know you see his Lazarus was laying in
[51:00] the term there was someone on the
[51:02] present that could bring him out of the
[51:04] tomb I mean there's someone that has his
[51:06] body begin to be rotten you know that
[51:08] life that was in Marion Martha's house
[51:10] they rejoice again they grew up they saw
[51:12] him birth maybe you know then you was
[51:14] like to spend time you know that was not
[51:17] taken from him by the devil by death
[51:19] there was someone on the earth now that
[51:22] could take him out of the grave it
[51:24] wasn't now maybe one day one day will
[51:26] happen in the future no he was on the
[51:28] earth present palea the Messiah was on
[51:31] the earth then amen to race that man out
[51:34] of the grave and it's the same thing
[51:36] with you and I the devil do we have a
[51:38] glorious camp who had a glorious King
[51:40] who was shouting and then rejoicing in
[51:42] his fault let's just march into heaven
[51:44] right now
[51:45] hallelujah but the devil doesn't want to
[51:47] let you stay in that way he's determined
[51:50] he sees you rejoice he says no I'm gonna
[51:52] knock that out of them I'm going to take
[51:54] that out of them I'm going to bring them
[51:55] back down and I'm gonna get them to
[51:57] thinking their minds well that was just
[51:59] a camp experience but the devil wants to
[52:01] diminish because what God did at camp
[52:03] was eternal right he didn't just make
[52:05] you happy for the sake of it he wanted
[52:07] to show you the victory he's already
[52:09] given you but you need to recognize it's
[52:11] yours I mean if you know it's yours and
[52:14] if you've lost it you'll say I want to
[52:15] back Holly I want what I had or what my
[52:17] that feeling I had I want to be able to
[52:20] rejoice like that not just at camp but
[52:22] every day even in the presence of my
[52:24] enemies I want to rejoice I want to shop
[52:25] probably because I know the sin question
[52:28] is settled in my life the perfect lamb
[52:31] has come he's wash all my sins away I
[52:33] don't need to worry am I gonna make it I
[52:35] know I'm going to make it because he has
[52:37] told me I'm going to make it he's
[52:39] already told me in his love letter to me
[52:40] I'm going to make it because he's taking
[52:42] care of it hallelujah so you know but
[52:45] the devil doesn't want us to rejoice yes
[52:48] I'm not very expressive that's fine but
[52:50] what's going on in here hallelujah you
[52:53] know so so the devil wants to rob us of
[52:55] these things but now just as Lazarus was
[52:58] taken for Mary and Martha they came out
[53:00] of that atmosphere of the devil
[53:01] you're the juice you know comforting
[53:04] them you know keeping them in that
[53:05] darkness that depression that pity party
[53:07] they they left that atmosphere they came
[53:10] into the atmosphere the resurrection and
[53:11] the life and then but then finally Jesus
[53:14] asks a question where
[53:15] you laid him and then so they go to the
[53:18] tomb and and you know the the comforters
[53:21] the devil always follows along he's just
[53:24] looking for something to do he's got no
[53:25] original thought so he just tries to
[53:27] hang around where God is just trying to
[53:28] disrupt the program and so the
[53:30] comforters went went with with them and
[53:33] then Jesus Jesus called because we see
[53:37] here
[53:37] he didn't say Lazarus come forth and
[53:39] then get the stone rolled away that the
[53:43] roll the way the obstacle first and they
[53:45] had to do it and wasn't Jesus didn't
[53:48] roll the stone away he didn't say hold
[53:49] on and then he put his little frail body
[53:51] there and push it away no he was calling
[53:53] Mary and Martha the the members of the
[53:56] bride that had to what was taken from
[53:58] them to be restored to them I mean they
[54:00] had to physically put their hands to
[54:02] that trial had to put their hands that
[54:04] obstacle and they had to push it away
[54:06] you know it's very easy to rejoice when
[54:09] you know you know we talk about the
[54:11] Lord's of resurrection the life and he's
[54:12] here to break every chain and he's here
[54:14] to set us free but when he says now now
[54:16] you've got to take part not that you're
[54:18] the one that does it but you've got
[54:20] actually put your faith into action he
[54:23] follow me you actually have to do
[54:25] something and so he says to them roll
[54:28] the stone away you got to roll the stone
[54:30] away you know oh this this depressions
[54:34] beating me down you got to roll it away
[54:36] you've got to make a choice ain't gonna
[54:38] put up with it or the thing that's
[54:41] between you and your joy and your peace
[54:43] are you gonna push it away what are you
[54:45] gonna do
[54:46] it's the emember brother card really
[54:48] sure can't the power of decision you've
[54:50] got to make a decision ain't you gonna
[54:52] put up with a tombstone we can roll it
[54:54] away how thick is the thing that you
[54:57] lost is on the other side what are you
[55:00] gonna do oh jesus will do it no he'll
[55:03] give you the faith to do it right just
[55:06] like brother James is preaching being
[55:07] made in His image on Wednesday I'm so
[55:09] glad that God's given divine favor His
[55:11] grace is fallen upon us to become his
[55:13] word right hallelujah but you know
[55:16] you've got to lay your hands on it not
[55:19] anyone else you you've gotta you've got
[55:22] to push the thing away hallelujah
[55:27] it's not a nice idea when I talk about
[55:30] joy or peace or love whatever it is
[55:33] being restored it's not a nice idea it's
[55:35] a reality as a tangible something that's
[55:38] living hallelujah so now but you have to
[55:42] we have to put our hands to what's our
[55:44] obstacle what stands in your way
[55:46] you know Goliath will come just like
[55:48] against Israel he make his boast same
[55:50] enemies just come out in the open and
[55:52] they challenge and they challenge
[55:55] spirits come and challenge you others
[55:57] like the other thing was the Amalekites
[55:59] or the M right so it was coming and take
[56:00] Zig leg as the devil that comes in
[56:02] behind but what are you gonna do he just
[56:06] gonna live with that loss you gonna say
[56:08] it's mine I want it back you have a
[56:10] choice you have a choice but you see her
[56:14] reaction to that was but he's been dead
[56:15] for days it's been a long time
[56:18] physically physically he's rotten any
[56:21] and he did begin to rot they didn't
[56:22] embalm bodies in those days his nose
[56:24] priory fallen his brain was already
[56:26] rotting away maybe the you know
[56:28] everything was gone out they said yeah
[56:31] but but lord
[56:32] he's thinketh it's been a while since I
[56:34] had this life back in my house this joy
[56:37] this peace you know but Jesus wasn't
[56:39] worried about how long or the condition
[56:42] that was in even how far God heaven he
[56:44] said I just just roll the stone away
[56:46] put your hands short roll it away
[56:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[56:53] and then then only when the stone was
[56:57] rolled away it was them that did it then
[57:02] he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[57:04] forth and we know because he's the
[57:06] resurrection the life brother Bram said
[57:07] if he didn't call him by name there
[57:09] would have been a general resurrection
[57:10] right but he called that to come forth
[57:13] he called Lazarus to come forth but
[57:15] Lazarus came out bound and his grave
[57:17] clothes was a napkin honest he had all
[57:19] those things and now jesus said to them
[57:21] loose him and let him go so now the
[57:23] disciples had to Mary and Martha had to
[57:26] actually put their faith into action and
[57:28] loosen and let it go let it have its way
[57:31] hallelujah you get the peace of God in
[57:34] your life don't just leave it bound up
[57:35] don't just put it on the shelf
[57:37] loose it let it take control of you
[57:40] Paulo you get faith in your life let
[57:42] fight have a perfect patience have a
[57:43] perfect work let faith rule well what do
[57:47] you mean by that well you're gonna let
[57:48] the would govern your life I mean so
[57:50] when the enemy comes in I've been
[57:53] reading about the life of Daniel his
[57:55] faith controlled him amen his faith in
[57:58] God controlled his walk
[58:00] controlled his life it wasn't what the
[58:02] politics of the day was doing it wasn't
[58:04] about the kingdom about those enemies
[58:06] were doing no his faith controlled him
[58:09] he he made up his mind I'm gonna pray
[58:12] towards the temple the temple wasn't
[58:13] even there is just a charred ruin but he
[58:16] just said I'm gonna pray to it cuz
[58:17] Solomon prayed said God if he prays
[58:19] towards this place you'll hear so and
[58:22] then the edict came out no one's allowed
[58:24] to pray for thirty days but to the king
[58:25] or whatever did he let that change his
[58:27] walk no cuz he let his faith was loosed
[58:31] it was now it wasn't bound up something
[58:34] is bound up you can actually just you
[58:36] know this is bound up it's controlled
[58:39] you take a dog put it on a collar put it
[58:42] you know put it in a cage it's bound it
[58:45] can't run it can't do like dog things
[58:47] it's stuck in that but when it's loosed
[58:49] then it runs and it chases and it does
[58:51] cause it's loose and now that dog you
[58:53] got to watch out now come here boy
[58:55] coming here now cuz they own it now that
[58:56] has rain but when you've got in a cage
[58:59] now you've got control it's probably
[59:02] very crude expression to to compare the
[59:04] Lord to a dog but you gotta let him be
[59:06] lord over your life you let him take
[59:08] preeminence let your faith your
[59:10] revelation of his word rule you you
[59:13] following me so Daniel wasn't swayed by
[59:15] what was going on around him he said I'm
[59:18] gonna pray anyway so happens as windows
[59:20] towards Jerusalem hey cries out jehova
[59:23] rapha jehova lord god almighty elohim el
[59:25] satya hallelujah I had talked to you
[59:27] today are they guys that Holy Roller
[59:29] again talking to his God he didn't care
[59:32] why cause his faith was loose and it was
[59:36] now living it was functioning in his
[59:37] life he wasn't he wasn't worried about
[59:40] anything else so that's what I mean by
[59:43] your joy let's come out of the tomb
[59:47] don't leave a bound
[59:49] loose it let it go oh but I'm you know I
[59:53] was thinking about the war
[59:54] reserved people are reserved one of the
[59:56] definitions of reserved as saved for
[59:58] later don't don't let your don't be
[1:00:01] reserved safe for later why not now you
[1:00:05] follow me
[1:00:05] I'm not reserved in that way you
[1:00:08] understand anyway but you know Daniel
[1:00:11] Daniel was Daniel was a man where he was
[1:00:15] living at a time and he was so moved by
[1:00:18] reading the scroll of Jeremiah there's
[1:00:21] in Daniel 9 and and he began to realize
[1:00:24] that the prophecy of Jeremiah was was
[1:00:26] was was now coming to its fulfillment
[1:00:29] because it would it was nearly 70 years
[1:00:32] since Jerusalem had been destroyed and
[1:00:34] God said in 70 years I will restore the
[1:00:36] people back so he was so moved by that
[1:00:38] he was reading the scriptures about his
[1:00:40] day and he was so moved by the
[1:00:43] fulfillment of the word in his day he
[1:00:45] began to seek and pray pray to the Lord
[1:00:47] and find you know Lord when is this
[1:00:49] going to happen hallelujah whoa what was
[1:00:52] happening his faith was loosed he wasn't
[1:00:55] just reading the scrolls of Jeremiah cuz
[1:00:57] all Jeremiah did a lot of things needs a
[1:00:58] vindicated prophet of God now he was
[1:01:00] reading it saying now Lord because he
[1:01:02] began to see himself in the book he
[1:01:05] beginning to see himself in the scroll
[1:01:06] when he was reading that prophecy he
[1:01:08] begin to realize I'm part of that
[1:01:09] prophecy because I'm living in the
[1:01:11] season of the fulfillment hallelujah so
[1:01:13] now he began to seek God God when is
[1:01:15] this going to happen because he knew
[1:01:17] that he was part of that prophecy I mean
[1:01:19] so now his faith was loosed it wasn't
[1:01:22] behind a tombstone of Conformity or
[1:01:24] anything of oh yo formalism and so he
[1:01:27] was seeking God until God gave him the
[1:01:29] the answer that when it was going to
[1:01:31] happen
[1:01:32] and it's friends it's got to be the same
[1:01:34] thing with us
[1:01:35] you got to see yourself in this you got
[1:01:38] to see yourself in the word just like
[1:01:40] you can see Jesus Christ in every
[1:01:42] scripture you should see yourself I mean
[1:01:44] because just as he is the word we are
[1:01:45] part of his word because we're part of
[1:01:47] him right so the Bible's got to be more
[1:01:49] than a storybook it's got to be a love
[1:01:51] letter to your personal and the only way
[1:01:53] it can be a love letter is when you fall
[1:01:55] in love with the author I'm not talking
[1:01:58] about the human authors they pinned it
[1:01:59] down talking about the one that spoke
[1:02:00] through them the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:02] himself so he began to pray and seek God
[1:02:05] and he begin to you know see where
[1:02:07] these things would happen and the Lord
[1:02:10] came gabriel think was seen to him and
[1:02:12] began to give him understanding but now
[1:02:17] and then but then Daniel was Daniel was
[1:02:20] told win because he because he's not
[1:02:22] just shown that time be shown to the
[1:02:24] time of the end and then he begins to
[1:02:26] seek God and say witness is going to
[1:02:28] happen and then Daniel 12 is going to
[1:02:31] read from verse 1 says at that time
[1:02:32] shall Michael stand up the Great Prince
[1:02:35] which standeth for the children of thy
[1:02:37] people we're going to come back to the
[1:02:38] tomb by the way if you wonder I'm just
[1:02:40] I'm just going to go around this way the
[1:02:42] Great Prince which standeth up for thy
[1:02:43] people and there shall be a time of
[1:02:45] trouble such as never was since there
[1:02:48] was a nation even at the same time and
[1:02:50] at that time thy people shall be
[1:02:52] delivered every one that has found
[1:02:54] written in the book and many of them
[1:02:56] that sleep in the dust of the earth
[1:02:57] shall awake some to everlasting life and
[1:03:00] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[1:03:02] and they that that be wise shall shine
[1:03:05] as the brightness of the firmament and
[1:03:07] they shall turn many to righteousness as
[1:03:10] the stars for ever and ever but Thou O
[1:03:13] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:03:15] book even to the time of the end many
[1:03:17] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:03:19] be increased so Daniel because his faith
[1:03:22] was loosed it was loosed it wasn't
[1:03:25] hidden away he got an answer when's
[1:03:28] these things going to be but then II but
[1:03:31] then when the Lord comes to this part of
[1:03:33] the part of the fulfillment he sees no
[1:03:34] the books got to be sealed up because
[1:03:36] it's not the time but but we can see
[1:03:39] from reading this that you know his
[1:03:41] people shall be delivered every one that
[1:03:43] has found written in the book so God has
[1:03:46] a book in heaven we know that he's got
[1:03:48] the book of life in the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:49] Life we know the book of life records
[1:03:52] our earthly earthly walk so what we did
[1:03:55] in our flesh that's why in the Old
[1:03:57] Testament you read all the failures and
[1:03:59] the faults of the believers down through
[1:04:00] wow that's like the book of life but
[1:04:02] then now when the blood of the lamb has
[1:04:04] shed you read now what God's God's
[1:04:06] biography of those people were so we
[1:04:08] take Abraham Abraham back slidden
[1:04:11] he went down to Guerrero into another
[1:04:12] place and he says to Sarah Sarah you're
[1:04:14] a beautiful woman you know they'll kill
[1:04:16] me if they find out we're married and
[1:04:18] they want to marry you so would you say
[1:04:19] that you're my sister and
[1:04:21] he she caught it was because they were
[1:04:23] half brother and sister so now yeah so
[1:04:25] so all those fatties were there you know
[1:04:27] there was there was David with Bathsheba
[1:04:29] all these all these families of the
[1:04:31] believers were recorded away because
[1:04:32] that was their natural life being
[1:04:33] recorded right and it's like as we come
[1:04:36] to an age of accountability the book of
[1:04:38] life begins to write amen
[1:04:41] but there comes a point just like when
[1:04:42] you read about Abraham in the New
[1:04:44] Testament when the Apostle Paul's
[1:04:45] writing the Divine Comedy rivers life he
[1:04:48] doesn't pick up those failures he
[1:04:50] doesn't pick up the time where where
[1:04:51] Abraham laughed in the presence of God
[1:04:53] have you ever read that God comes down
[1:04:55] to Abraham says you're gonna be a father
[1:04:56] of Nations and he literally falls at the
[1:04:59] feet of God and laughs in his face it
[1:05:02] wasn't just Sarah that laughed he
[1:05:03] laughed too but when the Apostle Paul
[1:05:07] began to write about Abraham he said he
[1:05:10] staggered not at the promise of God but
[1:05:12] was strong in faith believe you're
[1:05:14] believing persuaded that he would do
[1:05:16] that he is promised why is that because
[1:05:18] now the blood of the Lamb was come
[1:05:21] hallelujah that actually washed away all
[1:05:23] of their natural walk and God only
[1:05:25] recorded their faith walk it's the same
[1:05:28] thing with us now that's the Lamb's Book
[1:05:29] of Life hallelujah so now here we are in
[1:05:32] this day we come to an age of
[1:05:34] accountability the book of life begins
[1:05:36] to write but when God takes your book
[1:05:39] and he washes it in the blood of Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ I mean all those things that
[1:05:43] remembered it's not in his records no
[1:05:45] more it's been all washed away
[1:05:48] hallelujah hallelujah CC is now that all
[1:05:51] those that are written in the book shall
[1:05:53] be delivered so what he's saying is that
[1:05:55] everyone that's in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:56] Life they're gonna come a time where
[1:05:58] they are delivered and that's why I want
[1:06:01] to say that's why you can look back at
[1:06:03] what you were and what you are now is
[1:06:05] what what was not what you were you have
[1:06:07] something's happened to you and it's not
[1:06:09] just a conformity but we you can say one
[1:06:12] time God meant you change your nature
[1:06:14] change your desires change how you were
[1:06:16] trains change your appetite what you
[1:06:19] used to love you cannot stand and what
[1:06:20] you used to hate you love
[1:06:22] hallelujah I would never have come into
[1:06:24] a place like this to be honest I would
[1:06:27] never have come to this you can invited
[1:06:29] me every day every day I would never
[1:06:30] have come but one day God came holy us
[1:06:35] listen to the message of one day God
[1:06:36] came and he washed my book wholly washed
[1:06:40] my life
[1:06:41] Holly and those things aren't attributed
[1:06:43] to me no more it's been washed and when
[1:06:45] someone's washed in the blood of lamb
[1:06:47] their wash how are their change you can
[1:06:49] see there's a difference in their life
[1:06:51] it's not them trying to be a Christian
[1:06:53] God comes into them and he's a Christian
[1:06:54] out of them hallelujah I mention is
[1:06:58] going to be a full deliverance for the
[1:07:00] people and we're living in that yo I
[1:07:02] just love you know that's like when you
[1:07:04] when you look outside it's sunny and you
[1:07:07] hear the weather report it's sunny he
[1:07:08] just rejoices I want something I already
[1:07:09] know but it's good it's just a
[1:07:11] confirmation of what you're experiencing
[1:07:13] right it's the same thing when you look
[1:07:15] into the word for yourself when you see
[1:07:16] the Liberty you have I mean see walk
[1:07:18] them lamb has done see what God has done
[1:07:20] for us we just rejoice hallelujah well
[1:07:25] it makes me happy anyway so doubt
[1:07:29] hallelujah so and then he says that they
[1:07:32] will and they that be wise shall shine
[1:07:35] as the brightness of the firmament and
[1:07:36] they shall turn many to righteousness as
[1:07:39] the stars for ever and ever now we know
[1:07:41] stars are in a position when God said
[1:07:43] Let there be Sun Moon and stars he knew
[1:07:45] where all the stars would be in the
[1:07:46] constellations they are orbiting all in
[1:07:49] the same way you know there's a there's
[1:07:50] a pattern that's why they can predict
[1:07:52] when there'll be a Blood Moon will there
[1:07:53] be eclipses whatever and they can be
[1:07:55] exactly accurate because the heavens
[1:07:57] keep turning as God has ordained them
[1:07:59] but we know shooting stars are just
[1:08:00] chaos running through the galaxy it's
[1:08:03] still a star but it's a falling star
[1:08:05] it's a shooting star it's not in its
[1:08:07] possession but he's saying now that we
[1:08:10] knows that many shall turn to
[1:08:11] righteousness as the stars for ever and
[1:08:13] ever
[1:08:14] what he's saying is those that God has
[1:08:16] has your turn to righteousness they'll
[1:08:19] be like a star in heaven they'll be in
[1:08:21] their position in the body of Christ
[1:08:24] just like the moon is there God said
[1:08:26] moon you're gonna be there Mars is going
[1:08:27] to be there they're in their possession
[1:08:29] and so God God turned to righteousness
[1:08:32] and they taxes and places and the body
[1:08:34] where we're meant to be
[1:08:36] hallelujah and actually quite often it's
[1:08:39] actually us come to the realization this
[1:08:40] is what we're always worming to be hey
[1:08:44] man that's why the body begins to
[1:08:45] function why everyone comes to their
[1:08:48] position and God can manifest himself in
[1:08:50] a far greater way in a body of people
[1:08:51] than just one hallelujah and that's we
[1:08:54] know we're living in the time of a body
[1:08:56] work now Mary Martha had to roll the
[1:09:02] stone away why do you talk about Daniel
[1:09:05] because there should be something in us
[1:09:08] god what have you given me we read about
[1:09:11] an inheritance hallelujah it's a great
[1:09:14] inheritance that's a great you know you
[1:09:16] think of what we have even just eternal
[1:09:19] life is incredible hallelujah
[1:09:21] isn't it gonna be wonderful there'll be
[1:09:23] a time where I shall still be and there
[1:09:25] won't be time will be eternity I'll
[1:09:26] still be there I'll still be here
[1:09:28] hallelujah but now it begins a but but
[1:09:31] he wants us to know our position in him
[1:09:33] what he's given us and he wants us to
[1:09:36] know that because now we can actually go
[1:09:38] possess it hallelujah just like the
[1:09:40] promised land Israel came out of Egypt
[1:09:42] you know but in the spies were sent out
[1:09:44] they had to actually give a description
[1:09:46] off the land so now what it did to the
[1:09:48] believers are you're of that generation
[1:09:50] it gave them expectation wow this really
[1:09:52] else has it really flowing with milk and
[1:09:55] honey other grape you know it was
[1:09:56] actually God was actually showing them
[1:09:58] this is what you're gonna go possess and
[1:10:00] I've already given it to you be it's
[1:10:02] gonna go possess it just go walk up and
[1:10:04] take it hallelujah surely be battles but
[1:10:07] you've already won you just got to go
[1:10:09] forward and take it hey mints that's the
[1:10:11] same thing with you and I God's given us
[1:10:13] all things in him hallelujah and to
[1:10:16] think we're living in an age where you
[1:10:17] know we're not just cool just a plateau
[1:10:19] in our walk which is it granted the
[1:10:20] fullness of God hallelujah you know
[1:10:24] we're living in that age so what yo to
[1:10:26] me I think what we should do is say well
[1:10:28] what's mine have you made a list of what
[1:10:30] I don't have a list right now but you
[1:10:32] should go go through the scripture and
[1:10:33] say what does God given me you're
[1:10:36] probably writing our vision of this
[1:10:37] whole book but that's good I'm glad it's
[1:10:40] not just what but you should go look
[1:10:42] what is mine and it's not about well do
[1:10:44] I have it right now no what is mine just
[1:10:47] like taalib whinnies in Egypt he
[1:10:49] had a resurrection mountain in the
[1:10:50] promised land it was his his name was on
[1:10:53] it but he was in Egypt but he said no
[1:10:54] I've heard a voice God seemed to
[1:10:56] vindicate a prophet gods come down in
[1:10:57] this day to take me from Egypt as a
[1:10:59] slave to be now in my position in the
[1:11:01] land see you said let's go take it
[1:11:04] hallelujah he didn't have it he didn't
[1:11:06] have a speck of that mountain but
[1:11:07] something I don't see it it's mine I
[1:11:08] want it and she'll be the same thing
[1:11:10] with you and I what does God give it
[1:11:12] doesn't matter what condition you think
[1:11:14] you're in right now what's mine
[1:11:15] hallelujah and then you find out what
[1:11:17] y'all you say Lord give it to me
[1:11:19] hallelujah
[1:11:20] guess that's gotta be be good roll the
[1:11:23] stone away
[1:11:24] hallelujah welcome to be a stone of a
[1:11:27] stone of pride a stone of selfishness as
[1:11:30] you know a stone of feeling sorry for
[1:11:32] yourself just looking at your state that
[1:11:34] you're in you know through much
[1:11:35] tribulation do we enter the kingdom of
[1:11:37] God
[1:11:38] that's what the scripture through much
[1:11:40] tribulation through much trouble it's
[1:11:42] going to happen we can't escape it so
[1:11:47] you must accept it we're gonna have
[1:11:49] trouble sure we're gonna have trouble
[1:11:51] it's gonna be worth it all hallelujah
[1:11:54] when we stand around the throne
[1:11:56] hallelujah and we place our crowns at
[1:11:59] his feet and we crown of king of kings
[1:12:01] and Lord of lords
[1:12:02] there will be no regret there'll be no
[1:12:05] even the darkest darkest part of your
[1:12:07] life you will not be regret being in
[1:12:09] that place
[1:12:10] police say Lord it was worth it going
[1:12:13] through that it was worth being that way
[1:12:15] even Legion will say it was worth being
[1:12:18] in the tombs
[1:12:18] it was worth it was worth being stuck
[1:12:21] there because you brought me out
[1:12:23] hallelujah it'll be worth it
[1:12:26] amen so you know we shouldn't
[1:12:29] let's not feel sorry for ourselves God's
[1:12:32] given us the ability a mint
[1:12:34] to walk through the trial and to
[1:12:37] overcome the trial hallelujah Amen but
[1:12:43] you got a wrong selfishness pride
[1:12:45] indifference roll it away
[1:12:47] resentment roll it away God's never done
[1:12:51] anything bad to anyone
[1:12:53] I mean God wants to show something to
[1:12:55] you in the trial holy just like brother
[1:12:58] Tim Dodson when his wife died years ago
[1:12:59] he said God show me what I should know
[1:13:03] he said Lord teach me what you want to
[1:13:05] teach me in this trial because I may
[1:13:06] never walk through this trial again
[1:13:08] that's why it should be even in a small
[1:13:10] thing Lord what are you wanting to show
[1:13:12] me because he wanted to show something
[1:13:14] about himself and something about you
[1:13:16] hallelujah and so and about how the
[1:13:18] devil works so next time it comes along
[1:13:20] well you just Chris through it
[1:13:23] hallelujah Amen yes like the devil
[1:13:26] tempted Jesus in the wilderness he
[1:13:28] didn't just leave him here he came back
[1:13:30] after a season came to trouble him
[1:13:32] stirred up the people whatever it was
[1:13:34] but because he was the word he didn't
[1:13:36] let he didn't let those things disrupt
[1:13:39] his walk it was loosed hey God was
[1:13:42] loosed his faith was loosed nothing of
[1:13:45] Jesus was behind it - on his earthly
[1:13:48] journey follow me so nothing nothing
[1:13:50] that nothing the devil could do it could
[1:13:52] affect his walk and his walk was
[1:13:54] fulfilling the Word of God for his life
[1:13:56] he knew for this cause to be the Lamb of
[1:13:59] God for this cause I've come into the
[1:14:01] world to be a sacrifice redemption for
[1:14:03] many how they are so because he knew
[1:14:05] what he knew what he had to fulfill he
[1:14:08] could walk the way he walked how about
[1:14:11] you do you know why you're here well I
[1:14:14] live here because of this or this job
[1:14:15] well this has brought me here my
[1:14:17] family's here no but what about you
[1:14:18] there may be all part of it but this you
[1:14:21] know my job is not the reason I'm here
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:25] you know this is why we're here we're
[1:14:28] here to fulfill our Scripture you were
[1:14:31] to see what part of the word you hear to
[1:14:32] fulfill and I can tell you I mean by the
[1:14:35] authority of God's Word it's not to go
[1:14:37] into a lake of fire I managed to take a
[1:14:40] rapture I need to take a body change of
[1:14:43] translation of the Living Saints with
[1:14:44] the dead hallelujah that's what we're
[1:14:46] here to fulfill amen but you got to roll
[1:14:49] the stone away don't leave that stone
[1:14:52] there between you and the promise you
[1:14:54] gotta roll it hallelujah just like Jesus
[1:14:58] when he began to ask his disciples you
[1:15:00] know who do men say that I am and they
[1:15:02] say well some say you're Jeremiah Sorel
[1:15:04] I saw you know one of the prophets but
[1:15:06] said but who do you say that I am and
[1:15:08] the Apostle Peter said thou art the
[1:15:11] Christ the Son of the Living God he said
[1:15:13] blessed art thou simon barjona son of
[1:15:15] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:15:17] revealed this to you but my father in
[1:15:19] heaven has revealed us to you so no man
[1:15:21] told you this you didn't work this out
[1:15:22] on your own accord God gave it
[1:15:24] sovereignly to you there's now upon this
[1:15:26] rock what is that the revelation of who
[1:15:28] Jesus Christ is I will build my church
[1:15:31] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:15:33] against now we know a gate I've probably
[1:15:35] said this many times a gate is stopping
[1:15:38] access to something that's what a gate
[1:15:40] is so he's telling those people who were
[1:15:43] who are who are built upon the rock of
[1:15:45] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:15:47] the gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:15:49] against them so there's no gate that can
[1:15:52] stop you there's no work of the devil
[1:15:55] there's no tombstone there's nothing
[1:15:57] that can stop the believer but it's your
[1:16:00] choice if you go through or not it's not
[1:16:04] the devil that stops us it's actually
[1:16:06] ourselves stop us possessing every
[1:16:09] promise he tries to stop us but who's
[1:16:11] greater Satan was thoroughly defeated
[1:16:14] that day of Calvary he doesn't have the
[1:16:16] keys to his own house he was stripped of
[1:16:18] every power he's nothing but a bluff he
[1:16:20] surelly defeated he's defeated he's
[1:16:24] still defeated today so who's the one
[1:16:27] that we've got a defeat this guy if I
[1:16:32] can get this guy out of the way what if
[1:16:34] Mary Martha said no I'm not going to go
[1:16:35] see Jesus I'm going to stay in the house
[1:16:37] with my comforters Lazarus would have
[1:16:41] stayed did the promise is there you've
[1:16:47] got to possess it it's up to you they
[1:16:50] had a choice you've got to make a choice
[1:16:52] make up your mind
[1:16:53] no don't be double-minded is this right
[1:16:56] is it really what it cracked that ball
[1:16:58] to be or is the world right are my
[1:16:59] friends right are those whispering in my
[1:17:01] ear right what's right you've got to
[1:17:04] know what's right God's right
[1:17:08] amen I thought you know I probably said
[1:17:10] before they gave me brother convinced in
[1:17:11] a while ago you know all the parents he
[1:17:13] said stand up he said now you children
[1:17:16] if the world is so great why are we here
[1:17:19] you know why don't we stand our drugs
[1:17:22] and our parties and our movies our music
[1:17:24] in the world and the bars and the pubs
[1:17:26] and the making homebrew whatever it was
[1:17:28] why didn't we stay there for so awesome
[1:17:31] because it's not awesome this is this
[1:17:35] living is awesome
[1:17:37] so you know so be gonna make up your
[1:17:39] mind but the thing is you have to make
[1:17:41] up your mind it's not your parents car I
[1:17:43] can't make up my girls minds as much I'd
[1:17:46] love to just pour it into them God's
[1:17:48] alive and he is alive yeah but I can't
[1:17:50] give them the experience they have to
[1:17:52] come to their own choice Here I am Lord
[1:17:54] Lord Jesus that that God you that my
[1:17:57] mummy and daddy tell me about come meet
[1:17:59] me
[1:17:59] holy I want to know you the same way and
[1:18:02] he will meet me in the same way if they
[1:18:04] come at the right heart with the right
[1:18:05] motive
[1:18:06] some people say Oh Lord if you're real
[1:18:08] reveal yourself but in their hearts they
[1:18:09] don't want to know and there's all God's
[1:18:11] not really didn't charms up was cuz in
[1:18:12] their hearts they weren't actually
[1:18:13] willing to meet him amen but you know
[1:18:18] we've got to we have to see what the
[1:18:23] word is for us to fulfill you look into
[1:18:26] the scripture say Lord why don't why am
[1:18:27] I here
[1:18:28] hallelujah now he sees certain he sees
[1:18:36] in 1st John 5 he says whosoever
[1:18:39] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[1:18:42] born of God every one that loveth him
[1:18:44] they beget loveth him also that is
[1:18:45] begotten of him but this we know that we
[1:18:49] love the that we love the children of
[1:18:51] God when we love and keep his
[1:18:53] Commandments for this is the love of God
[1:18:54] that we keep his Commandments and His
[1:18:56] commandments are not Grievous for
[1:18:58] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:19:00] world and this is the victory that
[1:19:03] overcometh the world even our faith who
[1:19:07] is he that overcometh the world but he
[1:19:09] that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
[1:19:11] God now when we talk about faith the
[1:19:16] Bible says in James turn nineteen now
[1:19:18] believe if there is one God thou do us
[1:19:20] well the devils
[1:19:21] also believe in tremble so the Devils
[1:19:24] have a have some kind of faith but they
[1:19:26] faith that John is speaking about is not
[1:19:28] the same faith as the Devils because if
[1:19:30] the devil's believe if they had the same
[1:19:31] faith to believer had that be saved
[1:19:33] right but the Devils can't be saved
[1:19:35] right but they believe that he is you
[1:19:38] know but they believe there's one God
[1:19:40] they tremble so they have a faith but
[1:19:41] it's not the faith we have right because
[1:19:44] the faith we have is God revealing
[1:19:46] himself to us make himself known we into
[1:19:49] into a relationship with him but he says
[1:19:52] that this is the now I didn't mention
[1:19:54] this last week but I just want to plow
[1:19:56] it in a book he says this is and this is
[1:19:59] the victory that overcometh the world
[1:20:00] even our faith now that word victory it
[1:20:03] means in the Greek it means a conquest
[1:20:06] it means the means of success so so the
[1:20:10] means of our success to overcome the
[1:20:12] world is our faith hallelujah
[1:20:15] so the revelation of who he is and who
[1:20:17] we are in him causes us to overcome
[1:20:20] hallelujah it actually causes us to
[1:20:23] overcome you know and that's why you can
[1:20:28] look at your life like Mary Martha they
[1:20:30] had revelation faith right they didn't
[1:20:32] believe like the Jews belief they
[1:20:34] believed he was the Christ and they had
[1:20:36] faith to roll the stone away right
[1:20:38] that's what caused him to overcome to
[1:20:41] receive one that was dead back to life
[1:20:42] again
[1:20:43] they had Revelation faith to overcome
[1:20:45] that tombstone that yo that that stone
[1:20:48] was man-made it was cut by man's handle
[1:20:51] was shaped it was a man-made blockage to
[1:20:54] keep something to come back to them that
[1:20:55] they had lost hallelujah so but they had
[1:20:59] they had faith the means of the victory
[1:21:01] to get Lazarus back from the dead they
[1:21:04] had it to roll the stone away now how
[1:21:09] about you if we're to overcome remember
[1:21:14] he's the overcomer in us brother Brahim
[1:21:15] says he is the overcoming he's our
[1:21:17] overcomer but if we're to overcome we
[1:21:20] have to go through some battles an
[1:21:21] invincible army is not yo your brother
[1:21:25] MC it the bride when she recognizes who
[1:21:27] she is and to actually identify the
[1:21:29] antichrist spirit working within her mix
[1:21:31] in to discern and with standard she
[1:21:33] shall be an invincible army and
[1:21:35] vincible army isn't just a bunch of raw
[1:21:37] recruits that have come out of the
[1:21:38] training and they're marching up and
[1:21:39] down the parade square and their gear
[1:21:41] that's not invincible army and because
[1:21:43] they've never been tested in battle sure
[1:21:45] they can pass the training but then you
[1:21:47] got to go into the field where it's not
[1:21:49] not just set up theater to work out how
[1:21:52] to use your weapons and work as a unit
[1:21:53] now you've got to face something that
[1:21:55] wants to destroy you on the battlefield
[1:21:57] and so it's only those that have really
[1:22:00] an invincible army has to go through a
[1:22:01] campaign has to go through a battle has
[1:22:04] to be tried by every spirit has to have
[1:22:06] trouble coming to stress different
[1:22:08] spirits come in and try to upset their
[1:22:10] walk and their victory you know this is
[1:22:12] what we have to overcome so an
[1:22:15] invincible army will go through a few
[1:22:16] campaigns hallelujah but you've got to
[1:22:20] be very careful that the scars that you
[1:22:22] receive from the battles don't become
[1:22:24] stones that roll in front of what you've
[1:22:27] lost you got to be very careful that
[1:22:29] they experiences you know people they
[1:22:32] receive you're like I think I said about
[1:22:33] my my my great uncle he fought in World
[1:22:36] War two you know he he woke up screaming
[1:22:39] virtually to the day he died because of
[1:22:41] the trauma he experienced in the battle
[1:22:43] he survived the war he was alive you
[1:22:46] know but but the scars he carried
[1:22:49] emotionally bothered him to the day he
[1:22:51] died you know he was never a believer
[1:22:55] that I know of he's a great man
[1:22:57] but you know we got to be careful we
[1:23:00] can't let trauma because you know when
[1:23:02] the devil comes in but didn't you see
[1:23:03] God come down and deliver do incredible
[1:23:06] things you know mind battles and he
[1:23:08] delivered God delivers of mine bells
[1:23:09] trouble comes in and you don't know Lord
[1:23:11] how's this gonna work out you see things
[1:23:13] are falling apart it's um how God does
[1:23:15] grace brings us back together brings
[1:23:17] healing and restoration and you rejoice
[1:23:20] in the victory but be careful that the
[1:23:22] scars the memory of it doesn't become
[1:23:27] like a tombstone
[1:23:29] hallelujah you got to be very careful
[1:23:31] cuz sure it's always every battle is
[1:23:34] good in this bed I don't know one
[1:23:37] veteran of or any war that just came
[1:23:39] through unscathed
[1:23:40] either physical wounding or emotional
[1:23:43] trauma so there's always you know we're
[1:23:44] gonna carry some trophies hallelujah
[1:23:47] when we go up into heaven remember hey
[1:23:50] there's the reason the Lord has to come
[1:23:52] and wipe away all tears from our eyes
[1:23:53] don't cry no more children it's all over
[1:23:55] right because we'll be carrying
[1:23:57] something up there that we experienced
[1:23:59] here but he's going to wipe that from us
[1:24:01] hallelujah so there's going to be and
[1:24:03] all we're going to remember is the good
[1:24:05] right but we're gonna take some bad you
[1:24:08] know some some trouble if I can put
[1:24:10] maybe I'm hope this comes out right but
[1:24:13] there's gonna be things he's gonna have
[1:24:14] to wipe from our memories that we won't
[1:24:16] cry no more you with us right but we've
[1:24:19] got to be careful don't let bad things
[1:24:21] be a tombstone and don't justify it
[1:24:26] being there Mary and Martha justified
[1:24:27] they said but he stinker that's been
[1:24:29] four days it should that he needs to be
[1:24:31] sealed in there don't justify a negative
[1:24:36] thought pattern don't justify a pity
[1:24:39] party don't justify well this person to
[1:24:41] listen this person to that and therefore
[1:24:43] I have legal right to feel this way
[1:24:45] against this person they may have done
[1:24:47] all those things but Jesus forgave you
[1:24:50] you should be able to forgive anyone
[1:24:51] Amen if we were enemies of God but yet
[1:24:54] he loved us and died for us and washed
[1:24:56] us and cleanse us I mean we're aliens
[1:24:58] from him we weren't even in the
[1:25:00] Commonwealth of Israel even in the
[1:25:01] promise of God but yet he died for us
[1:25:03] hallelujah and a fever if he can forgive
[1:25:06] me the poor wretched sinner that I was
[1:25:08] and wash it away and and he never holds
[1:25:10] it against me he never comes me say you
[1:25:13] remember what you used to do you
[1:25:15] remember that no no he doesn't remind me
[1:25:18] of that
[1:25:19] he says come come apart y'all there's
[1:25:21] more whew let's go rejoice this guy over
[1:25:23] victory hallelujah let's go fight this
[1:25:25] battle take this land take this part of
[1:25:27] my word holier push the devil off your
[1:25:29] ground hallelujah he said come on let's
[1:25:32] go let's go never reminds me what I once
[1:25:34] did
[1:25:37] we should be and if we have the mind of
[1:25:40] Christ
[1:25:40] who's got the mind of Christ today then
[1:25:42] you will think about other people to say
[1:25:44] where he thinks about you irrespective
[1:25:47] of what they've done hallelujah my
[1:25:52] hallelujah now I might just I might just
[1:25:57] read this and then oh then I'll close
[1:25:59] VCS going back to the lens book of life
[1:26:02] he says but thank every one of you in
[1:26:04] here today is got your name on the
[1:26:05] Lamb's Book of Life you never put it
[1:26:07] there and your preacher never put it
[1:26:09] there neither your church put it there
[1:26:10] but God put it there and when did God do
[1:26:12] it it's written in the lap blood of the
[1:26:14] Lamb how many believes that there isn't
[1:26:16] enough ink remover or whatever it is in
[1:26:18] the world to get it out there look God
[1:26:19] put your name on the book of life at the
[1:26:21] foundation of the world and the Bible
[1:26:23] said we're just nothing we never had
[1:26:25] nothing to do with it I never had
[1:26:26] nothing to do with it God Himself did it
[1:26:28] at the foundation of the world when he
[1:26:30] slew the lamb by foreknowledge he knew
[1:26:32] that Christ would be here and he was
[1:26:34] called the Lamb of God slain from the
[1:26:36] foundation of the world and the Beast
[1:26:37] will deceive all that dwells dwells upon
[1:26:40] the earth whose names are not written in
[1:26:41] the Lamb's Book of Life on the
[1:26:42] foundation of the world he's I wish you
[1:26:44] Pentecostal people could see that that's
[1:26:46] the one thing you shorten that's what
[1:26:48] brings fear and trouble to you oh you
[1:26:50] say brother am I'm afraid we'll go off
[1:26:52] on the deep end of eternal security in
[1:26:54] all this oh no you don't have to worry
[1:26:56] about it if you keep your heart in the
[1:26:59] Bible he says at won't see it's the Word
[1:27:02] of God we're to just get rid of all the
[1:27:04] fear what if I fail cuz we love him so
[1:27:08] we don't want to displease him just like
[1:27:09] any relationship you don't want to hurt
[1:27:11] your spouse or your children because you
[1:27:13] love them you don't want you don't want
[1:27:14] to disappoint them you don't want to you
[1:27:16] know put them in any way because you
[1:27:17] love them just like us it actually
[1:27:20] builds a tension in the believers life
[1:27:22] because we want to walk with God and we
[1:27:24] want to walk in a way that's pleasing to
[1:27:25] him right but don't let the devil ever
[1:27:28] push you off on the deep end that you're
[1:27:30] afraid to do anything because y'all but
[1:27:33] what if God's not displeased no as long
[1:27:35] as your hearts in the Bible as long as
[1:27:37] your hearts and him he will guide you
[1:27:41] it will guide you through how Lou yeah
[1:27:45] you know some people they say well if
[1:27:47] I'm there I'm there if I'm not I'm not
[1:27:49] I say that's just unbelieving I say if
[1:27:52] I'm there I'm there and I'm coming
[1:27:54] anyway probably although the father has
[1:27:57] given me will come and you look country
[1:27:59] or no wise cast out so here I am Lord
[1:28:01] Here I am let me in let me in holy
[1:28:05] that's how I just be you know I would
[1:28:07] never sit back and say well if I'm there
[1:28:08] I'm there if I'm not no God is a
[1:28:10] gentleman he's given invitation to all
[1:28:13] you want to come marry me come be part
[1:28:15] of the bride be part of my word
[1:28:17] hallelujah you make up your bones so
[1:28:22] Mary Martha had to roll the stone away
[1:28:24] you gotta roll the stone away if you
[1:28:28] have left your first love something came
[1:28:30] in and now it's all as this writer than
[1:28:33] this ride and does this work as this
[1:28:35] putt user so you know people get so
[1:28:36] caught up you know we have an order but
[1:28:39] if you're so worried like I'll put it
[1:28:41] for example you know talk about sound
[1:28:44] equipment because I've researched it so
[1:28:46] much and there and and like when I first
[1:28:49] met the Lord I never thought about
[1:28:50] buildings and architecture and size of
[1:28:52] rooms and sound and never thought about
[1:28:54] that stuff I just love the Lord who
[1:28:57] cares about the but it of course is the
[1:28:58] church you think about sound and you
[1:28:59] think the so you gone to a place what's
[1:29:02] your mind on this is me let speakers
[1:29:04] there are you to wear anywhere and your
[1:29:06] mind is all this and God's moving in his
[1:29:08] power in the service and you're looking
[1:29:10] at speakers how ridiculous this is me
[1:29:12] this is me and I comes to a place you're
[1:29:15] gonna get next to yourself who cares
[1:29:18] about that
[1:29:19] when God is present put kids about is
[1:29:22] this all the color of this or this or
[1:29:24] this or this
[1:29:24] don't worry about that we can talk about
[1:29:26] that later but right now God has him
[1:29:29] fully and this hat should me listen to
[1:29:31] me
[1:29:32] I'm here to worship God not sound
[1:29:34] equipment hallelujah we can have the
[1:29:37] perfect building perfect acoustics
[1:29:38] perfect everything but if God is not
[1:29:39] there forget it holy I'd rather be in a
[1:29:42] place like this where God is our then
[1:29:44] anywhere else in the world
[1:29:46] lujah you say but what what cause that
[1:29:49] there's a stone the devil took something
[1:29:52] from me because I got caught up in what
[1:29:54] I saw I have to roll it away I had to
[1:29:57] roll that stone away and God said God
[1:29:59] and it got cold first love come back
[1:30:02] come off hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:30:07] God what and something that our head was
[1:30:10] now restored to me and it doesn't matter
[1:30:13] if it's works that works who cares what
[1:30:15] works we can have a power cut we can
[1:30:16] have a rapture hallelujah who cares
[1:30:18] about that stuff hallelujah glory to God
[1:30:23] but I had to make a choice am I gonna
[1:30:26] let this eat me for no reason
[1:30:28] or am I just gonna have a good time
[1:30:30] am I just gonna worship the God of my
[1:30:32] salvation and you can take that in any
[1:30:34] aspect of your life oh this is wrong
[1:30:36] what about what's right the devil never
[1:30:40] says that's right in that's right and
[1:30:41] yet you've overcome and yeah I have no
[1:30:44] part in you and you have no part in me
[1:30:45] and you're gonna take a rapture and I'm
[1:30:47] gonna burn in a lake of fire and you're
[1:30:48] gonna win and you're gonna be on streets
[1:30:50] of gold I'm not going to be there I'm
[1:30:51] cast down and he never goes that knows
[1:30:53] he's not that's wrong in that's wrong
[1:30:55] and that's wrong and what about this and
[1:30:56] oh yeah forget him forget him forget him
[1:31:01] he's not going to be when the lamb takes
[1:31:04] the book and revelations five the
[1:31:05] devil's not there the kids with the
[1:31:07] brethren is cast down that speak of when
[1:31:09] the bride has fully redeemed around the
[1:31:11] throne
[1:31:12] there'll be no devil there and I'll get
[1:31:14] to the end of this book and he gets off
[1:31:16] into the lake of fire I keep going on
[1:31:18] this he goes exit stage left in the lake
[1:31:20] of fire
[1:31:21] I agree exit stage right up into glory
[1:31:23] hallelujah that's my end
[1:31:25] that's his end so why don't we just look
[1:31:28] at our end worried but you say well
[1:31:31] that's just a nice idea it's not a nice
[1:31:34] idea because the Spirit of God we feel
[1:31:36] among us
[1:31:36] it's declaring there's a future home to
[1:31:39] go to I mean the very reason that God
[1:31:41] has moved on your life and transformed
[1:31:43] you because you have an eternal body to
[1:31:45] go into nothing your one day will d be
[1:31:47] there it's there already and it's
[1:31:48] calling you I mean that's a step in -
[1:31:51] that's theophany that's why God speaks
[1:31:52] you the way he does this is God as
[1:31:54] telling you have an eternal home you
[1:31:56] have a place to step into it's not just
[1:31:58] a nice idea
[1:31:59] here hallelujah so don't look at maybe
[1:32:03] I'm just too narrow-minded but I've got
[1:32:05] a heaven to go I've got a king to see
[1:32:08] I've got a God to rejoice I got him to
[1:32:11] worship I like him to stand before and
[1:32:14] say Lord you brought me here
[1:32:16] I didn't bring myself here you got me
[1:32:18] here Lord you cleanse me you wash me you
[1:32:20] save me you're a demon you kept me on
[1:32:22] the narrow way when I couldn't find the
[1:32:24] way you kept me on the way hallelujah
[1:32:26] you defeated the devil every place every
[1:32:28] place I went you conquered every foe for
[1:32:30] me you're the one who's overcome
[1:32:32] hallelujah
[1:32:34] do I deserve it no I don't deserve it
[1:32:36] but it's not about how you feel about
[1:32:38] you that's what he has declared about
[1:32:40] you that matters
[1:32:41] hallelujah if it's how we feel we'd
[1:32:43] never get there but don't worry about
[1:32:44] how you feel
[1:32:45] shall we fail them every day but there's
[1:32:47] a blood there's a lamb we have an
[1:32:49] intercessor working on our behalf we had
[1:32:51] an advocate which is Jesus Christ the
[1:32:53] righteous and he's standing there making
[1:32:55] intercession for you even right now
[1:32:57] hallelujah so what have we got to lose
[1:33:00] they say Lord will you really take me to
[1:33:02] that place why is he called you here
[1:33:04] that's why it's not when we get to
[1:33:06] heaven we'll shout the victory no we can
[1:33:08] shout it right here and the presence of
[1:33:10] the devil we can shout and rejoice and
[1:33:12] say Lord you've washed me you've saved
[1:33:13] me you're taking me all the way
[1:33:15] hallelujah we don't need to wait till
[1:33:17] then now because what you are now is
[1:33:20] what you will be this doesn't change you
[1:33:23] you're still the same person over there
[1:33:25] wholly aside say Lord take me you got to
[1:33:29] die whatever is holding you back push it
[1:33:31] away you know because the propers up
[1:33:34] yeah I've met people they started God
[1:33:35] begins to deal with them but when they
[1:33:37] talk about the world at a positive light
[1:33:39] or I can still do this oh I love being
[1:33:40] this they love their former identity
[1:33:42] what's happened their heart is not
[1:33:44] surrendered to God they're still apart
[1:33:46] I'm saying I loved being met but it's
[1:33:49] like the Apostle Paul you got to come to
[1:33:50] a place or I count all things but done
[1:33:52] done hallelujah here's a Pharisee the
[1:33:55] Pharisee holy man so coool be seen oh
[1:33:57] that's done what were you the Apostle

[1:34:02] amazing all these great gamellia
[1:34:04] teaching you all these scrolls with
[1:34:05] that's done it was done hallelujah but
[1:34:10] God in His grace when he's been
[1:34:12] that's not done chriskiss Oh hallelujah
[1:34:18] you gotta roll the stone away just roll
[1:34:22] it away watch it roll and fall of the
