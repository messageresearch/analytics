in taranaki amen let's um yeah praise the lord so good good to see everyone here this morning amen happy father's day to all fathers god bless you i trust you got as cool the gifts as i got i got some real cool cards this morning so amen you know we only ever have one father it doesn't matter how good or bad he is you've only got one so cherish that one amen let's go to um oh can you put that slideshow up i just want to um this may i just want to read this is unusual probably but if i can find it this isn't the message of grace just like a husband taking a wife saying if you'll be a good woman if you'll take care of the house if you be true to me if you keep my clothes clean if you uh if we have children if you be a mother to them if you'll do things i'll work till my hands bleed to make your living if you'll do it but then think what if that woman turns wrong lives lazy won't work won't do nothing then it takes grace to keep that family together he says oh god it takes the grace of jehovah to keep his family together and that's the way where jehovah's family today is because of the grace of jesus christ we'd all be gone but it's grace oh grace amen so the grace of our our heavenly father keeps us together amen let's just let's just bow he's in a word of prayer before we read the scriptures this morning lord jesus lord because you live lord we can face tomorrow and i want to thank you lord that we have such an assurance that you live lord you've proven yourself alive over and over and over and over and over again lord and not just back in the 50s and 60s or 2000 years ago or but lord in 2020 lord you have proven yourself alive and lord is truly your grace lord by your grace you keep your family together lord i want to thank you for your grace that holds us lord it constrains us lord it leads us on and i just pray dear god may you just bless bless your word today lord may take these crumbs and multiply it lord and i just pray you bless your word to each one lord we're asking your blessings upon those who are not here today as well lord we think of the youth that have gone up to taranaki lord i pray they would have a blessed time together lord and may have a blessed service lord this morning as well lord be their portion lord and we thank you for our fathers lord jesus may bless them today o god and lord we especially want to thank you lord because you are the author of life lord you are our father and we thank you lord that i know how long lord each and every one of us was a different time in life maybe we're very young or maybe well up in years but we came a time we recognize you are our father you turned our lives around and changed us lord and we thank you for that lord thank you for your transforming power lord i just ask your blessings upon the word take the service under your control lord for your glory lord bind any contrary spirit to your word in the name of jesus christ and may have liberty to move as you want to move lord in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats oh no sorry we're going to read the words hold on let's not be too quick on the trigger to sit down let's go to psalms 91 amen we're going to read we're going to read the whole psalm amen amen i yeah i'm i'm plugged in i'm turned on i'm conscious i'm here i got friends in the back that look after me they just i get these eyeballs and yes i don't know the hangs hand signals some you know anyway psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will save the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the anoints and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand are at thy right side but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands thus thou shalt dash thy foot against the stone thou shall tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample undefeat because he has set because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name this is talking about you because amen i trust you have set your love upon the lord jesus christ amen he shall call upon me and i'll answer him i will be with him in trouble i'll deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and will show him my salvation amen and we're just going to read from exodus chapter 33 here just a bit of a context um well i trust and and we're going to just read from verse 8 down to 11. exodus 33 and verse 8 and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses till he was gone into the tabernacle and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of none a young man departed not out of the tabernacle amen i just pray the lord bless his word this morning may have your seats i'd like to speak about living under someone's shadow it's going to throw this definition out there and then we're going to um go into the service but so so living or walking in someone's shadow so it's a so there's just you know i just googled it there's a saying you know you're walking in someone's shadow and and it's to walk in someone's shadow this idiom is used to portray that something or someone is following in the footsteps of someone larger who is perhaps ahead of them in life this figure could be usually a father figure a business person etc but i want to talk about someone far greater than it's living in the shadow of the lord amen you know we know there's many shadows that someone can live in uh but i just want to focus on joshua here amaze it's amazing the incredible things i'm going to try and get out of first gear but you know oh boy anyway joshua lived an incredible life he you know many times we would we would think of joshua when when he was commissioned in joshua chapter one to be strong and courageous and you know place the people in the land but he was living under the shadow of moses for 40 years before this he he saw an example lived in front of him that was an incredible example because the scripture would tell us that you know there's no prophet like like like moses was where god would speak lip to ear to a man and and and and i put the scripture up here because it's incredible where where god would come down into the tabernacle and the people would stand in there you know you know and and watch this all take place but joshua was in the tabernacle with moses and he would see god come down and he'd see god speak to moses and and this this this was an incredible impression on his life and and i pray that you know we would be the same kind of god would live in our lives in in such a way that the younger generation would come under the same kind of and you know impression where you know it's amazing there is a saying that uh familiarity breeds contempt and it's not a scriptural saying it's just a saying that someone put out there where the more familiar you are with someone it can actually breed a contempt because you see all their strengths but you see all their weaknesses you see their good days you see their bad days you see their upside down days you see the days they wish they never got out of bed in the morning but you see all those days but so joshua saw all those days with moses he saw moses when he stood in the gap and said lord take my life blot my name out of the book that the people would be saved he saw moses do incredible things saw him open the red sea call the plagues do everything like that but then he also saw the days where where moses was stressed you know moses was having a hard day moses was you know feeling the strain of the people and you know and and he also saw moses frustrations he saw when he just got sick of it you know you know he got mad and he even even called the people of israel you bunch of rebels do i have to bring water out of this rock for you and he smote the rock and you know he saw when when moses would get in the mood and maybe moses was real tired and people were badgering him and calling on him and he saw maybe moses wrecked in the flesh quite a bit too i mean because brother brahm said you know when god came down it was god speaking through moses but after the anointing left and moses was moses and so and so joshua beheld the good the bad and the ugly of moses but this did not make joshua that this wasn't the shadow that joshua was living under when when when he was following moses you know because because joshua could look past i mean yeah joshua could look past the flesh of moses he could look past his humanity he could look past his troubles he could look past maybe how he would talk to people maybe in an off kind of way or i don't know how he addressed the people but you know he could look past what the other people found fault in and he could see god amen and that's the main thing i mean when we can look at one another and see look past our humanity look past our troubles look past our you know you know as i said maybe last sunday sunday ago you know they kind of all merged together nowadays but you know our children you know we are our best and our worst at home our best and our worst hallelujah we put on our church face we come to church hallelujah and we should anyway because god's good god yo my lord jesus has done nothing bad towards me so i should worship him with everything i have amen because he's only done good he's only loved for me cared for me guided me pulled me out of very many dangerous places so you know i've got nothing to hold against him that's why i come to church and praise the lord amen but you know but you know so so joshua saw the good he saw the bad and he saw the ugly of moses but he could look past that and see god and that's what made now so he wasn't living under the shadow of moses humanity there were other people in the camp that did corey and dayton would rise up and they'd just be offended and be annoyed at moses they say you think you're the only holy one in the place we're all holy and you know they would rise up and try and usurp authority and you know because they they were they were looking at moses humanity and they perceived the faults that were within him and he had faults we all have faults if you didn't say amen you're either deluded or you i don't know you know yeah yeah isn't there a little song you know um you know kids would sing it i am so great i am so glad everybody loves me or something i am so great who's had kids sing that no okay anyway i won't sing that one you know but you know some you know this anyway some people think that they just made of you know what i mean but you know we're all human and and moses could you know what moses had is good and his bad he saw this joshua saw the splits in the church he saw core and nathan rise up he saw trouble he saw you know people trying to wrangle their way in and do things you know he he he experienced the disappointment of katerspanier he saw the disappointment of wandering through the wilderness for 40 years and that whole younger generation experienced that they were living imagine that 40 years going around the same mountain 40 years we can't go on in our walk we're staying right here because our parents disbelieve the promise what an incredible shadow to be raised up in we're born imagine being born in the wilderness mommy and daddy where we're from where we're going why are we in this place and and they would have to tell their children the conclusion of the matter is we're stuck here because of our unbelief but somehow god moved on the hearts of the young people that they didn't live under that shadow of that disappointment but they actually received a heart of faith saying we're going to take this land we are going to break the cycle of unbelief that our parents are in and we're going to go on and possess every divine promise of god we're not just going to wander around and have church and go out and have church and go out but we're going to go on and take every promise amen they were living under a different kind of shadow you know what i love about living under a bad shadow you can come out of that shadow you don't have to stay under that shadow you know what i love about the weather it always changes even in this place it changes it's not always windy it's not always raining it's not always kind of cold there's the sunny days hallelujah you know people say you know you can never beat wellington on on a good day well it's probably because we only have the one good day you know but you go you travel north a bit and every day is way better than our best day but you know we have our good days the weather always changes so we can be living under a cloud but we don't have to stay under that cloud and we can be living under a disappointment you know it's not just people that we live walk in the shadow of we can walk in the shadow of regret something bad happened in the past we can be walking in the shadow of that we could be walking under the shadow of disappointment we can be walking under the shadow of pain you know people can carry something that happened to them decades ago can be carrying that thing because they're walking under the shadow of it we don't have to stay under that shadow hallelujah just like the weather changes you know i look outside it's raining well i know it's not always going to be raining it's winter middle of winter i'm sorry i'm not a fan of winter i love summer i love those baking hot days i just i just love those kind of days you know but i know the middle of winter where the days are real short you get up in the dark you you come home in the dark i know it's not always going to be winter there will be another spring there will be another summer right so it doesn't matter you may be going through the most gloomiest part of your life there will be another spring there will be even families go through cycles of of a summer time everything's going fine and then something just happens and you know then then there's a winter time and everything seems to be going hard but then there's a summer again right so so families go through seasons you know go through cycles and you know but we don't have to take the memory of of winter into into summer into spring we can say praise the lord i'm glad i'm not back there now if you love winter well you enjoy the snow you know it's pretty to see it fall but then you got to go live in it you know anyway maybe i was flatting too much in christchurch and freezing places and all the snow and it's so wonderful and then it's freezing and you can't feel your feet and you're inside and anyway you know but there will be another spring so people can live under the under the shadow of negative things for for for very long but but i don't want to focus on that but i just want to say you can come out of the shadow of that you can come out of it just like you know um even even as as as david would would would come to the throne and and he would he would um he would ask the question let's see any of jonathan's house alive and they found out that mephibosheth was was one of joshua's uh jonathan's sons rather and and he found out that he was alive and jonathan i mean sorry mephibosheth was crippled because when jonathan and saul died in battle the nurse picked them up and ran for ran ran ran for their lives and when he has been carried he got dropped and his feet became crippled so he was living under a shadow of being a crippled outcast for many years but then dave remembered his promise with jonathan and then he asked the question is any of jonathan's house still alive so what was happening david wanted to bring mephibosheth out of that shadow i want to bring him to my table i want to bring him to the king's table i don't want him to be far away somewhere living in this you know i'm a i'm far away from the throne you know i i was once living there because my my grandfather was the king you know but now i'm far away and you know sometimes we feel very far away from god and god's far away somewhere and we're just in a corner somewhere and he doesn't care and he does care it's the devil that wants to keep us under a shadow but then because david remembered his promise with jonathan he got mephibosheth and didn't want him to be a a a a servant he didn't want to make him make fun of him i mean in his court he wanted to restore him to his rightful place at the king's table and the beautiful thing about mephibosheth is he has crippled in his feet but when he was sitting around the king's table and the and the and the tablecloth you know came down over over his legs and everything you couldn't see his crippled places he looked like everyone else at the king's table amen so he didn't have to live under that shadow of the past anymore he was the same as everyone else at the table hallelujah what's that got do with living under a shadow god wants to pull us out of those places amen joshua would live under the shadow of moses he would walk with moses he would see what moses would do but the main thing is that same god that that that he would watch and come down and speak to moses he met that same god he knew that god was a you know god is you know many times we make promises to god god i'll stop doing this i'll start doing this i'll be like this we have to stop putting trust in our promises and start believing his promise right because it's his promise that will bring us out it's not us trying to turn a new leaf though those things are good because our attentions are good but it's not lord i'll do this and all this no no you just take faith in his promise and let him change you amen now so joshua lived under the shadow of moses and he saw beyond the humanity of moses and he saw god and then so now when it was ma joshua's time because remember god doesn't want us to live under the shadow he wants us to walk with him personally so it wasn't enough for god god wasn't satisfied just having joshua be be moses minister he had to come to his position in time amen and when he did amen the same god that that that moses knew joshua met hallelujah amen see the lord pardon me the lord has always been a family man he says it's an adoption he says so we won't read it but if you read genesis 1 it says and the lord uh god made heavens and earth but then when man's coming the picture says and the lord god so what's happening is he's called god that's elohim self-existing one but then the lord god means the self-existing one who reveals himself who has relationship and because that was always god's purpose he says but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am uh y h u j u v u h yahweh jehovah what does it mean i am the all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine glory why he gave man jehovah means he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family now some of us when we think of god as a father kind of cringe because of our earthly fathers but you know and and that you could say the problem and i'm very much preaching to myself is that how our parents i mean how our children see god they'll see it because how we treat them and and i'm i'm sorry that that's the case but that's the case but you know so so sometimes some of us cringe it you know god being a father but he's a father amen he's a father i mean he's not just a husband or a bridegroom or you know he's our father i mean so so he exists with his family allah elohim now now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now god made man to be the predominant over all the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his dominion he was god over the earth he would could speak and it would move it would be so he could speak this and it would be so old there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him he says there you are now maybe he said that as there you are that's what it means but to me says there you are jehovah with his family there you are amen because he's a family man and as a family man he wants his little ones around him hallelujah and as a family man he's a protector amen we may see the world falling apart but we are living under a different kind of shadow i mean we're not living under the shadow of fear the shadow of doubt the shadow of worry we're living under the shadow of the almighty that's why we read psalms 91. i mean they that dwell i mean let's just go there just because it's such a powerful a powerful um psalm he that dwelleth in the secret place the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty that's not a shadow of gloom that's not a shadow of doubt there's not a shadow of fear that's a shadow of the almighty amen i'll say the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and whom will i trust surely he shall deliver deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall covet thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler hallelujah so this is a great place to dwell amen this is where we're meant to dwell remember remember he is he is jehovah existing with his family and if he is a family man which he is he wants his family around him that's why he called israel out of egypt he says out of egypt i've called my son so he gathered them to himself and the purpose that he built the tabernacle is that he would dwell with his family hallelujah but we know that that was never meant to be the end you know the resting place of god but god didn't just want to be with his children he want to be in there in them amen that's why you know brother brown would say in christ is a mystery god revealed um if we can find that and i have it here i'm sorry you know me and well i'd probably say disclaimer every service the first thing god wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not he was too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin who had the question when they were young when did god begin amen yeah because we can't fathom eternity you know that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and go out into the infinite into the um eternity in a great creature uh that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do this brother brahms telling us this is you know because remember when he preached his service he said i'm going to tell you what was in the back part of god's mind before the foundation of the world and and i can't remember who said it but they said how he came with this service as he is he studied with the bible in a concordance and he gave us christ the mystery god revealed that's more than a man putting the word together that's god so so now now this is god revealing the back part of his mind to you this is what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son a man that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now do you get it congregation says amen see he wanted to express himself that that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself and cry secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people so before there is a molecule he says i'm a father i love fatherhood it's who i am and then he created all this universe and the milky way and the nebulas and all the different things and the whole purpose was to put you on this little speck and this whole you know there's way bigger suns than our sun there's way bigger planets than our planet but this one has life on it surely you know you think well there's way better people on the earth than than than uri sure there are but there's life and the believer there's a predestinated seed so his focus now i pray god saved him too don't get me wrong but there's a focus god has a focus right he has a focus on the earth the reason his life is here his children are here he didn't just make this place or you just to see if he could he made us and this earth for a purpose and that purpose is that he would walk with you and you would know him and love him hallelujah you would manifest his purpose upon the earth hallelujah why because he's a family man he cares about his family his whole purpose of being is for his family he's not selfish right he's not selfish but his whole purpose of being is for you hallelujah you know loneliness is from hell to feel alone is from hell because hell is full of lonely people there's no camaraderie there there's no you know we're in this together kind of thing no no everyone's alone there that's how hell is the feelings that creep into you know you know upon the earth now of being alone being depressed being being aimless having no purpose that's all from hell that's all from hell you know our our father's not distant we may have had distant fathers i'm not speaking for myself with that but you know you may have had the most distant father in all of ever our god's not like that you just may have had a father didn't care and was so absorbed in himself our father's not like that our god isn't like that hello he's not distant amen we're never meant to feel alone that's the devil trying to cloud us over it's amazing how brother brown would would would describe spirits in meetings and and i don't have it on me here but he says i want to write a book about demonology and he described different spirits of like looking like like spiders with long hair and tortoises and you know different different shapes of animals these spirits would take these forms as they're being cast out and you know and he'd see a gloominess of darkness over the people and you know of unbelief or hurt or whatever it may be trying to block them from the visitation of god or feeling alone or feeling numb or feeling indifferent you know that's all from hell we have to identify remember our the human the human being is not made to feel empty the human being is not made to feel alone the human being is not made to feel uncaring completely we're not ice blocks where do those feelings come from the devil but we have to recognize that's where they're from remember god is love hallelujah our god is love he's not he's not a god of just just wrath and judgment and destruction no he's a god of love hallelujah he doesn't want us feeling you say well god so far from me i'd say that's probably a demon spirit trying to block you god doesn't care about me well where'd you get that thought from you know i wish i had one of brother andy's curry pots right here i've been using that pot all week i hope everyone else has two and it hasn't burned on the bottom it still works real well hallelujah because we're going to stop and think why do i feel this way is this my father trump remember he loved fatherhood and a real father loves to spend time and and pour themselves into their children and you know love them and have relationship and talk to them and you know even though sometimes we find it difficult yeah we're not great communicators for some reason men in the fall they lost their ability to talk and you know sometimes but you know but but but our god is not distant he's not a person of stone or you know it just doesn't speak he wants to speak more than we want to hear brother brown would say you know he would say that he wants to give us the holy ghost more than we want to receive it hallelujah so you know all those things were to think now what shadow am i living under if that's going on i got one here now you can see this on film this is from the um you know 20th century prophet film this is the this is the prayer line but afterwards she she can see this this is not just on tape he said excuse me sister i have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're from you're from away from here you come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart and you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that so she's living under a shadow oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that's what that was a man who was professing divine healing the sister says yes sir and you can actually see she's actually crying if you if you who's watched that so she she recognizes not this man speaking to me this is more than a man speaking to me how can this one know my life our father knows all about us he knows everything about us the good and the bad he knows about your humanity he knows about your weaknesses hallelujah he knows about the weaknesses the things that we wrestle with so much and we and we hate so much he knows all about them hallelujah but yet he still saved us because he wasn't looking at our humanity he's looking at the seed that he put on the inside of us before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen now is that true see you've got a holster in your church or something another about it isn't that right so this is what a lie can do this man told a lie and it's now go it's not just her troubled with heart trouble now the whole church has got a stir about it oh we've got a witch inaudible it's a holster it's a lie one lie look what it's doing it says now it's not just her with the shadow this black sheet following you it's now the church or something or something another about it is that right your pastor's sick right now he has got polio is that right yes sir that's her saying that sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they are lying the only thing that's wrong with your heart is a nervous condition has got your heart worked up go on home in peace god bless you you're right god bless you you're not a witch hallelujah you know there's a saying sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me unfortunately that's not a true saying sticks and stones may break my bones but words can scar and damage me yeah that's just a lie and she was living in this condition because of a lie but the spirit of god came down her father came down saying no no you know you're not a witch the reason that this is troubling you is because this lies affected you in such a way and you're living under that lie see she was all stirred up i'm a witch this man this man professing divine healing so obviously she saw supernatural in this man's ministry that said you're a witch now she's all troubled i'm a witch but when god came down and the whole church was stirred up too but when god came down and showed no that's a lie this is why this is go on you're not a witch and then and she wasn't living under that shadow anymore why are you saying that well many times you think well people are shadowed to death with cancer or something big or it could just be a lie something that someone told them years ago and they believe that lie and they're living according to that lie how do you think she would have been in her heart i'm a witch why am i a witch what spirit's on me and she goes to church she's living her life she's all troubled thinking that she actually has a spirit of like a demon spirit in her making her a witch would have been tough but she came to the right source hallelujah why because our god is a father and he cares for us you may think well no one cares about me in the whole world even my own earthly father he cares our god cares he cares more than you realize hallelujah now brotherhood says as an influence he says and it was a lesson to isaiah isaiah was living under a shadow of king uzziah he was impacted by a godly king but that king we know he rose up tried to take a priest place got leprosy he must have put his eyes upon human beings for an example he mustn't put his eyes upon a human being for an example he must put his eyes on god now that's us amen we can we can lift each other up too much sure we should live an example you know what i mean but you know we can put oh that one can stand i can stand but god can calls that wonderful to say now what about you remember if ten thousand four on my one side a thousand on the other david said it's not going to come know me because i'm living under the shadow of the almighty so irrespective of what's going on around me i can still walk with god it's not if the church oh if the church stays together i'm going to rapture no no no god can cause this place just to close he can say i don't know this is done spread you out somewhere oh god will never do that he could remember never never never never tried to put words in god's mouth he said but we meant to have a church sure but what i'm saying is you know we're not going into rapture because this place looks fancy we're going to rapture because we are individually walking with the lord jesus christ amen i pray this place never falls apart if if god's hand remains on it i believe it he'll he'll keep it amen i hope that's okay now any man any man is subject to mistakes he is subject to error because he's human he's subject to the violations of god's laws he's subject to many things because satan tempts him and he's just a human being and if god ever lifted his hands we he would fall that's all and i've heard people say oh satan can't do that he's brother says yes you just let god lift his hand one time and watch what happens he says it's i constantly plead god don't send him have mercy on me keep away from me you see i need god's mercy we all need that and and and when did brother brown preach this after the seals after he's an adopted son receiving the sword in sabino canyon the word of god he's in his place in the body he's saying lord keep him away from me don't lift your hand off me hallelujah we don't want to get puffed up and say well i can do this now then god just lifts his little pinky off you and all hell breaks loose lord keep me under the shadow keep me under your hand lord keep me in your hand oh god hallelujah we're going to jump to the anointed ones at the end time brother brahm says i don't want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed up with mine i want my spirit to be pure and clean brotherly love holy with the holy spirit now if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right and though i might have the right to get back at them oh boy you know how you get ammunition i'm ready i've got it i don't want to i don't want that in my life no i want to have love i want to be ready to correct with love with love that absolutely answers out yonder for it so he says i don't want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed up with mine well how can we get such a spirit it depends what shadow that you're under you know eve eve came under a different shadow she was once under the shadow of god but then another shadow came into the garden another influence came into the garden and this anointed a creature called the serpent and now this serpent begins to ask her questions so she comes under a shadow and then they have a conversation and he asks a question you know you can eat of every tree and and but then the serpent says about that particular tree you won't die for god doth known the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil so here is now an influence coming into our life saying you know both good and evil and sometimes you know people can get a spirit on them that they want to know everyone's flaws to try and discern what's going on in someone else's life what is that i'd say that's actually the tree of knowledge of good and evil paul when he came to the corinthians says i don't want to know anything among you but christ and him crucified i mean so he wasn't interested in what was going on necessarily you know this one's like this and this one's like this you know but he was more caught up and i only want to see the lord amen you got to be careful what anointing comes on your life oh but but i need to help that person hold on jesus gave a parable or he gave a teaching why try and pluck the moat out of your brother's eye you hypocrite when you got a whole beam in your own get the beam out of your own eye and then maybe you can then you can help your brother so really if we want to help one another we need to say lord work on me get those big forceps and pull the trees out of my eyes lord jesus that i can see according to your word 20 20 vision and all those things and then amen and then when you can see correctly then you can help your brother or your sister but the serpent wanted to play i'll show you good and evil why did she need to know evil why do you know balaam balaam was taken by the king of moab when he couldn't curse israel he says i'll oh i'll bring you around and uh and i'll show you the hindu parts all of the bad parts of the camp not the nice big tents and the nice great things you know all the sin all the all the all the brokenness all the horrible part of the church you know balak took balaam and said i'll show you that part and then when you see that part then you'll curse them then god will curse them and that and and that's what you know that's what the serpent comes he says i want to show you the bad parts of that person's life i want to show you all the bad they've done and their and their humanity and you don't agree with that part of them because this is how your builders how people should be built and you know all those things but then when the anointing came down on balaam he says i cannot curse what god has blessed and he says i see no iniquity in jacob this was god actually god anointed balaam this wasn't balaam's attitude about israel now this is god this is god's testimony balak said look at all this stuff going on and god actually anoints balaam and says no this is what i see god says i see no iniquity in these people they had their sin they had their trouble they had their you know humanity and the things they wrestle with but god said i don't see iniquity with these ones because they're following my pillar of fire they're following the word amen they are on their way to the promised land hallelujah they're not stuck as a denomination just just there in the land no no they're going on into every promise and god would say i see no iniquity in jacob oh my i pray that that's god's testimony of me when the devil comes around says look at this and ben does this and this this is him and this is him and god does not i don't see iniquity in my family my family's perfect this is god's sake my family's perfect hallelujah amen because remember if he makes little ones of um of himself and he's proud of his family now we know he doesn't turn a blind eye to our failures in our sin that's why he made a way hallelujah i'm glad he made that way don't you hello i'm glad we're not under blood of bulls and goats but he made a blood his own blood i mean paul what's that was the blood of god that was on the cross we don't worship a jew or a gentile that was god made flesh hallelujah amen and there he was he shed his blood upon the earth amen then the life and that blood comes into the believer and changes us and we go from glory to glory hallelujah our father cares does he care more than we'd ever fathom he cares that's why we have to care don't sit in gloom or despair or whatever your whole life may have been a tragedy don't worry about that walk out of the shadow mephibosheth life that he remembered was a tragedy i'm a i'm far away from the palace here i am i don't know if i'm going to get killed or not because i'm from the house of saul not from the house of david he's living under this fear all the time and then the one that he was afraid of called him come to my table don't be far away wherever you are come to my table be at my bank wedding table you know the very one that you know many times the one that we're afraid of is the one that can help us it is the only one that can help us you know jesus you know i love that song that brother isaac uh wrote then you sang on wednesday with brother armand i just got the conclusion jesus is on his way jesus is on his way doesn't matter how bad it gets jesus is on his way the disciples were in their boat and they were worried there was a storm and then they saw the very one that could help them was walking on the water towards them and they were more afraid of the one that could help them than the storm itself you know we go through trials we go through hardship and then jesus comes walking out on that storm oh it's a spirit what's this going on they were scared of him and he said no it's me it's the master hell there why because jesus was on his way why because his children were caught in a storm and he didn't want them to drown he wanted them to get to the other side hallelujah we're going to get to the other side one day more than across the natural sea we're going to go into a rapture amen we're going to recognize jesus is on his way it doesn't matter how bad it gets how you know i love the story brother brown would would would tell i think it's from world war one there was that platoon of soldiers however many they were they were hemmed and they were pinned down by german machine gun fire and they tried to send a runner to you know because they knew they were going to get massacred they couldn't get out they were stuck there and and and didn't matter how many people tried to run out you know they'd get shot whatever so but someone had to carry a pigeon hallelujah and then so they wrote a little note and they pinned it to that carrier pigeons you know leg and that was their hope this is their only hope they released them into the heavens and they and they watch his carry pigeon go up and then the germans try and kill it you know and it gets wounded whatever but somehow it made it it made its way hallelujah to its destination and somehow landed in the headquarters and the someone picked it up took the took the um bit of paper read the coordinates help were under attack whatever send reinforcements hallelujah and then and then they sent reinforcements and that whole platoon was saved because of a carrier pigeon sending a message julia we had a laugh we had a dove of god one day when adam's fallen race was hemmed in hallelujah and he went up into glory with his own blood holy with a message hallelujah hallelujah yo what i love about the whole thing reinforcements came i say jesus came jesus was on his way hallelujah it's the same thing with you and it doesn't matter how much you know we hemmed him by the devil we can't get out he's pinned us to the mat you know we're in our last final moments we think jesus is on his way hallelujah jesus has purpose our father has purpose he's not just occupying time our god has purpose it must have been an incredible scene there in jarius's house this was his only daughter and she just got sicker and sicker and sicker she would have dries loved his daughter no doubt they would have got the best doctors they could have got no doubt they would have got a little a lot of meals the synagogue would have cared for them that you know he was well liked in society he would have got a lot of help but the one that he needed to get to he was told to stay away from because they were commanded if any man go to anyone go to his meetings they'll be excommunicated from the synagogue but jurassic he would go uh in disguisement brother brown would say and and he would go into the meeting secretly no one would identify who he was and he would watch the discernment he would watch the healing he would watch the wonders and he would begin to see this jesus of nazareth that the people speak against so much against i mean this is actually the messiah i mean this word that we have received that god has come down in this end time and he's revealed himself i mean it's more than healing it's the messiah it's jesus today hallelujah and so he would slowly watch his daughter get weaker and weaker and weaker and then finally he had to come to a point i can't go secretly i've got to go now i've got to go in the open and i've got to get him to come and touch her because otherwise she's going to die remember she was getting sicker and sicker and sicker by the whole time jesus was on his way yes sir sure they had a lot of sympathy in the house they had a lot of medicines they did all they could they prayed all they could pray but they needed him to come and then so here he goes he puts on his preacher's coat he runs out to where jesus is pushes through the crowd he doesn't care oh that's jurassic oh he's the leader of the synagogue all the whispers in the crowd because everyone talks about everyone you know he didn't care about that he didn't care about being exposed he was willing to come to the master hallelujah and then so she then then he falls down at his feet and then and then says you know fell at his feet and besought himself greatly yes what's a what is besotting him greatly that's not um my daughter's unwell can you please come we will be convenient to you no no it's jesus my daughter's gonna die come come to my house please come to my house jesus hallelujah my little daughter life at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live hallelujah and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and we know uh you know if you keep reading down i don't have the scripture on me but you know this is where the woman with the blood issue got healed hallelujah but jesus was on his way to driest house he he just had a burden i've got to get to jesus hallelujah and he got to jesus that's the thing we can get to jesus too you know even in a even in a very chopped up kind of service like this we can get to jesus uh we can get to him amen and and and he can meet our needs and then so he was on his way with jarius but as he was on his way finally draz is thinking the answer has come she'll be okay she'll be okay but finally when jesus was walking with him she breathed her last breaths gave up the ghost and died and all hope left the house because life had gone out of the body but jesus was on his way it became totally hopeless but jesus was on his way hallelujah and then so finally a a a servant comes running no doubt with tears down his face and distraught and you say don't trouble the master why and andres would say why what's wrong she died she died dries and then no doubt his little heart would have just fell like a lead balloon my daughter's dead but he had the resurrection the life with him and so here he comes into the house and we know the rest of the story puts everyone out calls it by name takes it by the hand and she lives but jesus was on his way to driest house hallelujah and i trust it's the same thing with you and i when trouble strikes jesus is on his way when sickness strikes jesus on his way where where things you save you don't know the end of it you can't see the light of the tunnel you can't see the answer jesus is on his way hallelujah amen so he he got to the master see this is our father in action there's a need of his children he goes meets that need you say well what if he doesn't appear to answer the prayer he knows then from the beginning we want it sometimes a certain way but god has his certain way hallelujah and we have to have confidence if our father can bring us to the earth you know even a natural birth is a miracle that's an incredible thing that life could somehow come and you know babies can grow and that's an incredible thing amen so if god can get us naturally here and then meet us and give us a new birth don't you think he can take us all the way don't you think our father can you know there's not a there's never a point in in his economy where it's a too hard basket kind of a job hallelujah he he doesn't have that he doesn't have that he doesn't have easy tasks and hard tasks you know you know the easy you know normally if we have a to-do list the hard ones are kind of just keep being shunted down the bottom of the of the list he doesn't have too hard and easy and you know they're all the same to him they're all easy nothing's too difficult for our lord jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah see i can hear his little heart sinking like that he looked around at his wife there standing seeing what he was going to say and looked over and seen his little dying daughter he said you might um you just might as well take her off because here i go take his name off the church book that's right i'm on my road he had a need rushing he must go now they said remember if you go you know what's going to happen you know our declaration yes i understand all about it but i've got a dying child here see when when when need really strikes who cares who cares what people think people say attitudes of people no no there's a need yes i understand all about it but i've got a dying child here and the very thing that i've hit in my heart all the time i've searched the scriptures i've attended his meetings under disguisement i've checked the scriptures and he is the messiah amen that's it amen that's the way too he says oh the church said now you remember if you um if you do well what's going to happen but dries had a need the need and brother if there ever was a time brethren that we ought to make our confession that he is the messiah the son of god that he is alive then and his power is just the same there's a need today today is the hour people are dying people are dying in churches amen he says people are oh my lord jesus hallelujah but we can live under a different kind of shadow joshua joshua lived under the shadow of the almighty he saw it in moses life he was impressed with such a life and then he and then he met that same god i'm just going to kind of wrap this up now timothy i'll just i'll just read this quickly timothy was told by paul this is the this is one of paul's last letters that he would write before he loo before his head is chopped off he says but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra and no doubt timothy when when when he read those different names he he he remembered the accounts of of what happened there i mean what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me so saying you have fully known my life because remember timothy was called paul will call him my son in the gospel so timothy was living under the shadow of the life of the apostle paul and it impacted him such a way amen that when paul's voice was silenced from the earth timothy just moved right on doing the work of an evangelist she said you've fully known my manner of life my purpose faith long suffering charity and patience my doctrine paul would have trouble in his in his flesh where where you know you know that you're that messenger of satan would would would come and buffet him so so he saw the trouble that paul would have you know in his own humanity but yet even that didn't sway timothy from from following the apostle paul because he looked beyond the flesh he saw god and he wasn't like demas who who had forsaken paul um who said well maybe paul's just washed up now maybe this is why his ministry's gone down so he did something wrong timothy stuck with him we need to be you know our god our our lord jesus he's a father don't live under the shadow of this world or trying to please someone you know people people are influenced by so many things they want to be like this guy and you know i think i've told you before you know there was a guy so i was at i was at boarding school the last four and a bit years of my high school career and and and in one boarding school i was in there was a guy in my dorm he wasn't my friend he didn't like me but i thought he was cool and i and and how he dressed i started dressing like him because i thought he was cool he somehow influenced my life what good did it do me nothing yeah but but we we let so many things influence us why don't we let the lord jesus christ be our influence live under the shadow of that don't live under the shadow of disappointment well i've done so many bad things in my life don't worry about them put them under the blood and move on although i don't know how this is gonna just just don't don't live under fear don't live under worry don't live under unbelief amen just live under the shadow of the almighty hallelujah remember he's our if he is our father he's going to take care of us amen amen if he is our father remember it's jehovah with us dwelling with his family that's what he wanted in the beginning that's what he's going to have in the end right and all the way down through time he's had his children and he's looked after his children sure some have gone through the fire and through the flood and some through a great hardship and they've some have been martyred whatever more but as their last breath leaves their body he takes them you know we're all going to go through a portal of death yes should the rapture not happen you know there was a story and and and we've been watching the cloverdale place and and i'll just finish with this but you know brother brown asked a question where did you come from where are you going where where'd you come from i'm not talking about naturally i'll say well i'm from gisborne no no that's not what he's asking where'd you come from where are you going and and brother brown would i think he mentioned it but but but they did a play about the 40 soldiers for christ who's heard that story so during the time of the romans i think it was the time of nero as one of the emperors when when when christendom was was was was coming to its forefront there was a decree made throughout the roman empire that every roman i think every just soldier they had to make a sacrifice to the emperor i think it was nero at the time i might be wrong because they the they believed that the emperors were gods but there were 40 soldiers in a in a legion they were christians and and the decree came out you are the sacrifice to the emperor make a sacrifice or you're going to die and they decided they're going to die and so so they were given the so so what they were did they were they were put in prison for a week and this one man looked after them in prison i think that's how the story goes because because the leader of the army or the captain whoever he didn't have the jurisdiction to to to execute these these prisoners now had to wait for the general to come and it took him a week to arrive then they had a court trial and this general tried to make them say yuri can't you sacrifice to the emperor or you're gonna die and how you're gonna die as you see that frozen lake out there you have to walk out on that lake you're going to go out there naked in the night and you're going to die you're going to freeze to death and and they decided no no no we are we are not going to sacrifice to the emperor because what good does an earthly man do what good can an earthly man do for you and i or a woman what good can they do you can give your whole life to some great hero of this world what good will he do when you come to the life end of end of life's journey but people live under the shadow of they're fans of so many different ones and and none of those people that they care about imagine imagine if i was just a big you know i think i think brother isaac used this illustration imagine if i loved darts and and all i lived i lived lived and breathed darts from some sunrise to sunset and i had all the famous people on my wall and you know all those things and i gave my life savings to go see them play in a tournament and this was my big ambition in life i want to see this talk this is the world chat this is the world championship man this is big this guy's going to play against this guy and you know how's it going to work out and all the stats and all those things you know but then i go there i see them play it may be the greatest bout of darts that's ever happened in the history of man but then i go home and i'm just living with a memory what's that going to do me and then i come to the end of my life and i've given my whole life to darts nothing against darts anyone who plays darts you know whatever but i'm just using it as an illustration because it's safe you know it's a safe thing to talk about but what good would it do me if i live and breathe darts all my life is that's going to take me into heaven it can't so what's good giving our life for some human upon the earth whatever the cause is it can't help me when i come to my last breath oh but jesus was a human but he was god and he still is god so so these soldiers said no no we'll go freeze on the lake so they put guards around the lake and they actually had a bath house that was right on the lake's edge and they had the fires all hot and they and and they told the soldiers if when you come and recant you come give your sacrifice to to the emperor in this bath house it's nice and hot but they march out on the ice 40 soldiers for christ 40 brave soldiers for christ and they go out there naked freezing and they stand out there in the cold and then and then all through the night they're singing 40 brave soldiers for christ and their but their voices get quieter and quieter because some begin to die and one of them looks at the bath house because they can see it from where they're standing on the lake because everything's dark but they can see the light of the bathhouse one of them actually half frozen makes his way back to the bath house and as he gets near the bath house he actually begins crawling because he's half dead and then he gets and then he gets into the bath house and he dies now what good was that that guy was telling girls last night that guy will be remembered for the guy who turned back he lived just as long as the others on the ice he was trying to pay homage to an earthly king that will save his earthly life but he that loses his life jesus says shall keep it yes and he that keeps their life shall lose it well what do you mean if you lose your life you'll keep it if you lose your life as and you give it to the lord jesus that my life is no longer mine i've lost it i've given to him i'll keep it at the end but if i keep my life to myself because i'm under the shadow of something else that's not god i'll lose it at the end but then does that happen there was one of the guards it was there's either one of the guards around the lake or or the man who was guarding them in the prison history says the spirit of god struck him he ripped off his armor and everything and he ran out onto the ran out onto the ice and said 40 brave soldiers for christ he was so he was living under a different shadow it was maybe just for a week he was living under that shadow but it so impacted him that he gave his life for this jesus that he just heard about hallelujah so what shadow are we living under we can live under the shadow of the world we can live under the shadow of pain or some some something from the past or we can come out of that and say lord i want to live under the shadow of your wings amen i would rather live under the shadow of the almighty i think that's the best place to be doesn't matter what comes what goes what happens i'm if i'm under his wings i'll be okay we'll meet those guys on the other side you know we'll meet those brothers hallelujah and as they overcame we'll overcome why because they are living under the same shadow as we are under the shadow of the almighty amen let's um musicians if you just want to come this morning and just leave it there i pray that the lord jesus would so be a influence on our lives that we just want to live under the shadow of his wings he's worthy isn't going to be wonderful one day should life leave these bodies we we don't need to be afraid hallelujah that holy ghost has been in us all our lives when we really met him will carry us into glory amen let's stand shall we this morning [Music] maybe let's just bow our heads and i just want to ask you the question do you want to come out from under a shadow do you want to come out from living under a shadow like mephibosheth and come and dine at the king's table if you want to be remembered and pray you say brother ben i've done so much wrong i've maybe my past but how i was raised or whatever's just crippled me up you don't have to live under that anymore if you want to be remembered in prayer you just want to raise your hands to the lord i mean let's just all pray together shall we lord jesus lord i'm so thankful there's a place under your wings lord there's a place for us there lord where maybe we don't feel welcome in this world anywhere but lord there's a place that we're welcome lord and that is under the shadow of the almighty lord i pray father your holy spirit would so impact us lord like joshua would see you come and speak to moses and so and so lord grip them lord jesus so impacted his life lord jesus that he could see beyond moses mistakes and he could see you live lord and then you brought him father lord you commissioned him to take the people into the land and let me think of timothy the same way with paul and lord jesus many down through
