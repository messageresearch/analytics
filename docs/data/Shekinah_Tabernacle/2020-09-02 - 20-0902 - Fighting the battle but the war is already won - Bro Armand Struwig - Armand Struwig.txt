evening i'm going to ask brother adamant to come up and do his item amen so i was brought to isaac to sing this song because it means a lot to me it means it's deliverance and every time i hear this song it gives me hope and the knowledge that it's it's already done and when i get to my weakest point all i cry out for is deliverance and he's there jesus is there so yeah if you feel if you feel you want to sing it with us more than welcome brother can you turn me just a little bit down please a little bit thank you it's the sound i hear in the valley when hopelessness surrounds me and everywhere i turn there's no way out it's the sound i hear in the battle when all my strength has failed and everywhere i look it's crumbling down i hear the sound of deliverance when i bow down my head lift up my hands and i cry out to jesus i can hear him coming like a mighty army like a mighty army delayed will come will come when i need jesus your always come deliverance will come will come when i need jesus he always comes it's the sound i hear in the desert when all i feel is thirst and everywhere i look i see no rain it's the sound i hear in the stillness when the answers just won't come and darkness closes in and comes around i hear the sound of deliverance when i bow down my head lift up my hands and i cry out to jesus i can hear him coming like a mighty a mighty army [Music] delivers will come will come when i need jesus he always comes and delivers i will come i will come when i need jesus he always comes so lift up your eyes all you weary lift up your hands oh you

will come when i need jesus he always comes and delivers will come will come when i need jesus he always comes [Music] deliverance will [Music] [Music] amen amen deliverance will always come when i need jesus thank you brother isaac thank you joshua thank you brother phil we all can stand so we can just open up tonight in a word of prayer just open up the scriptures as well and invite jesus in he's the one that delivers so it's worthwhile inviting him into the meeting nothing that man can do can deliver himself amen amen so we're going to go to the book of hebrews and we're going to read chapter 4 and we're going to read there from verse 11. amen um so this thought has been just give a bit of background on it this thought has been coming a while and and every time i get a little bit of a thought and brother ben asked if i would share a thought everybody else seems to preach what i was thinking you know and i got a bit disheartened at a stage because i thought man i just want to deliver what the god gives me you know and when it bubbles it must bubble out you know because it just must come out so i'm just going to preach it anyway so so brother ben and brother um james you've you've already done all the work i'm just going to do it from another angle so it's all been said it's just maybe my words you know so um but my words fell but let god's word always be the truth they amen so we start there at verse 11 and um we can maybe start that verse 11 and it says here let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any mean man fall after the same example of unbelief now the thing we want to address tonight that the title of the sermon is finding fighting the battle but winning the war the war's already won okay so just keep in mind if the whole thought goes about there's a battle and it and we have to fight some battles but the war is already won okay so just keep that thought and and hopefully it will all come out all right so verse 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any to each sword piercing even to the dividing asunder the soul and spirit of the joints and the marrow goes very very deep and very sensitive when it cuts and it is a discerner and this is where i want to base my most of my thought on of the thoughts and intent of the heart amen so let us just pray our gracious heavenly father lord i can i can read this bible and i can open the pages of it lord but only you can open your word father you have done it already through a prophet lord and you all we come is just to come and say lord we need more we always need more lord you're not just a god that stands still but you're a god that keeps on moving in our hearts moving upon our hearts lord and you always teach us something new lord jesus to help us to further the kingdom of god so we just come tonight lord and ask help us lord may you just come down tonight and you speak to us may it not be man's word because man's will will fail lord may be your word and a word in season may help us with our daily struggles lord may it help us to overcome might help us just get us closer to you lord because that's the reason why we preach this gospel lord is not because we think we have it all because we know we need it all lord jesus and we just come to you and say lord we need you more and i need you more as well lord and may if there's any distractions or anything there lord i please pray may you intercede tonight lord may this fault anchor into our hearts lord jesus and lord help us lord as we walk in this walk lord we know that we cannot do it on our own we need that captain lord jesus so tonight lord would you just step in the gap would you just fold this place up with your presence father and lord may we all just get a blessing and it can help us in our fight fighting this enemy lord i pray this in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ anyone that's not your lord be with them father be with them as what you are with us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you can take your seats amen i'm going to try to take it just a little bit slow but i'm gonna eat the highlight and hopefully we will finish within time so we can go into a prayer meeting so when we when we read the verse 12 and it says in verse 12 that it's a discerner of the thoughts and the tense of the heart so no i've i've been listening to the greatest battle ever fought and if you ever want to go listen to a sermon that would get you on your feet again punching the devil back that's that sermon that's right okay it's that sermon because there's a line in the sand and that's basically where a christian can go i stand here and there's no further amen okay devil you cannot come past here because there is a place where you need to draw that line and say you ain't going to go past this anymore i'm not going to be beaten i'm not going to be trolling upon i'm not going to be said what i need to do i'm going to draw the sand now this my line is now drawn so what i want to do is i want to give glory to god and i want to give the glory in such a way to say that there's been a message and this message works okay it works and if you're feeling you're struggling and the battles are real and you're feeling like you're getting beaten down just go back take your bible read okay listen to the message get on your knees pray and god will show you that you actually haven't lost the war you just lost a battle because you will lose battles let us be honest you're never going to win you're never going to get to a fight if you look at a war you're never going to win every battle you win a bit here you lose a bit yeah you win a big year you get reinforcements you both push on you win here there's always things happening around but so you might lose this one you might get it wrong but the war is not over okay so let's fight each battle as it comes and that that came from from um brother james god bless you brother james he says here in 1962 he sees in the greatest battle ever fought and all my notes is from that because i thought i'll just stay with what god showed me he says now do you know we have wars and rumors of wars if this earth stands we'll have plenty more wars but do you realize there's only two powers in all the universe of all our differences between nations so all our different differences between each other and everything else mounts up to only two powers only two powers there's only two kingdoms two powers two kingdoms all the rest is little minor things they are all connected either the one power or the other and those power is god's power and satan's power he goes on to say this says and every war every disorder everything that comes along it is either either controlled by god's power or satan's power because that's the only two powers there is and that's the only power and then he goes on to make a statement and he says and this is the power of life and the power of death so that means when we we going up against our enemy every time we go up against him it's actually a fight for life and death it's not just faith and doubt and and belief and unbelief it's life and death and it's not to say that that because i'm saved i've got my salvation my helmet of salvation is on i know i'm saved i know where i'm going the lord has changed me he's working in me that doesn't mean all of a sudden i'm just going to go by the wayside and fall off and die that just means life is in the tongue so what we speak what we confess what we say can bring life or it can be death so you can be in the very same situation and you can speak life into that situation and turn the battle or you can speak negativity into the situation and turn the battle but it's still life and death because the choice you make still has two outcomes it's either going to glorify satan or it's going to glorify god but which one do we choose and see this is where the battlefield lies now the battlefield don't lie anymore in heaven with the angels where michael kicked satan out and threw him all on the ground and now the battles here on earth no no it changed i'm not going to jump ahead but the tactics changed and there's a battlefield which god and satan both agreed and it's called the middle ground and and brother isaac touched it on on one day in one of his songs and it and it's stuck and i'm going to read it but i don't want to get ahead i just need to go a little bit back so these two powers fighting and those powers actually is fighting for you and for me you know so when we walk into this door satan didn't stay at the door he didn't decide i'm going to stay at the door and i'm going to leave the christians to come and sit and have a very nice time nah nah nah he sat here waiting for you because every distraction he can give you he's going to give you every reason that you want he's going to give you it's it's two battles can you take it or can you leave it can you discern it and can you cast it away that that's the battle that's the very real battle we face so he says the greatest battle ever fought is going on right now yes sir it's between life and death it's between sickness and health it's between faith and doubt it's between liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spear soldiers polish your armor and get ready for god is getting ready soldiers amen god anoints his army okay so he's now he's now taking the battle and he's actually pointing it to who's directing the battle so we're the foot soldiers we're on the plane we're fighting but he's now turning your view and saying listen this is not you there's someone in charge so we'll follow that thought so here was one where he says god dresses his army hallelujah what kind of equipment do we use we use the spirit of the sword the word of god amen the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword hebrews 4 piercing even and to the ascender the bone and even the marrow of the bone even a discerner of the thoughts of the mind the word of god to believe his word and that is the way god armors but now he speaks about eve and what happened in the in the in genesis 3 and he says that's what he gave eve to arm herself with was the word of god because he said you shall not eat from that fruit he says and she broke down her armor how did she do it by opening up a mind to reason you don't reason with god's word that's right amen i just need to do something or else i'm going to really lose the track of my thought please excuse me i had little footnotes and they trigger thoughts amen there we go praise the lord so now he says if we look at if we go to to genesis chapter three and we just read there and i'll just read this verse one two three and he says now the serpent was the most subtle than any beast of the field which the lord had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said see he came with the word and we all know this we've listened to the message so many times but just catch this just catch this he says ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden so he's asking her is that not what god said so he comes with the word of god he's going to help her now and he says and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the god and god says you shall not eat neither shall ye touch it least ye die so she fortified her behind the word of god but see satan is not going to leave it there so he said okay i got you here and he says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die it says because for god does know that the day you eat thereof your eyes shall open and you shall be as god's knowing good from evil so he's even telling the truth he's saying you'll know once you eat the fruit you'll know what's right and wrong okay but see now here i want to say the battle is between life and death and god said if you remove yourself from out my word you will die now he physically did not die the curse started that day but she didn't die god made a way for us the lamb sheep blood of the lamb so that we can have a chance to come back and worship him because that's where he made us to fellowship but eve she fell because she left that armor she left that word she started she started listening she started reasoning because with what's the difference between any any denomination and the message is the nominations is words of man let's say it as it is it's opinions it's doctrines it's and and and the doctrines and man's word makes the word of god to no effect because it has to come back to a source of truth and if you look at the message not once his brother branham ever pointed us to a doctrine he pointed us back to the word and he says yes fortify yourself behind the word and so now if we can do a bit more of a reading so we don't have the training because what happens is now okay we're going to go to ephesians 6 who knows ephesians 6 the armor of god who knows that amen so i've got ephesians 6 and i'm going to read and i'm going to show you a couple of things in there so i'm just going to put on the armor of god and i'm going to defeat the the devil be careful because you still need training it's no point having a sword and wielding it left to front and hurting and killing as far as you go if you don't know how to use it so there's an element of training there's an element of surrender there's an element where you still have to show up to that battle and each battle is different so don't forget your training because if you don't pray if you don't read your bible if you don't spend time with god you're not training you know if you don't listen to the message if you don't sharpen that blade you're going to get sucker punched you need your training it's it's important it's your life that's right you know it's no point you say of all the armor and you go standing at the bed and you go oh what does this do again and how do i use this and oh i've got the truth i'm telling the truth am i is it really the truth and because i've got my goods lined with the truth you know i know it's the truth but but it really isn't the truth because you're not training you're feeding the black dog so that's the only thing that's going to happen is you're going to get bad technique you're not going to fight the the devil and he will come with a little bit of truth and then bend it and because you lost your training he sucker punch you and you're left with a question why would god do this and why is this happening and because i'm now i'm struggling it's now a very real bad and why would that brother say that to me why would he want to hurt me and now what he does is he starts working on your reasoning so now i'm going to bring the armor of god in because that armor is very important that shield of faith is so important it's just as important as this word it's just as important as the helmet of salvation knowing where you belong it's all important you can't throw any of your ammo away you can't throw your stuff away you can't leave your training you cannot leave your shield you cannot leave your sword you need it all for each battle each battle not the war each battle because the ones you lose is the ones when you get out of training it's when you slack yeah you know and you go like oh what did i do again with my with my sword you know and you go to mom and go hey mom did you see my bible it's sunday school today and i don't have my bible and and what am i to do mom did you see my bible and you walk into the sunday school class i can speak about this i've got first-hand experience i used to do it myself and you get there and the sunday school teacher goes where's your bible oh you know um yeah no my mom didn't bring my bible sorry so you're going to give your mom a sword right so when you go to bed you're going to leave your sword there at the moment say mom i'm going to go defend the country with nothing oh that's great so how's that battle gonna go for you because it's still a battle you're gonna lose that battle because your enemy he studies you he watches you he can't wait for you to slip up because he's keen he's in the battle because his life is at stake because the book says you're going to burn in the lake of fire and he goes i don't believe it because he's an unbeliever to begin with he's not a believer he's an unbeliever so even the very word that's attributed to him he doesn't believe it because he actually thinks he's going to win this thing but see he's showed up for the battle and when you walk through this store on a sunday he showed up for the battle he ain't going to scour away he ain't going to go oh here comes the sons and daughters of god oh i might just go here and say yeah sorry guys i don't want to bother you and please sit stolen and listen to ben because he knows it all and no no no no no he waited for you at that door he waited for you next to your seat and all he's going to do you is going to fire his dots and go oh you want to think about football and you want to think about music lessons oh that girl you like thee and ooh who's that boy and i said football jessie ain't no soccer and oh you want to throw that rugby ball in so he'll shoot you everything to keep your mind busy so that you miss what you need for the next battle you know he didn't come to play he come to destroy he says this as a roaring lion seeking them that he wants to destroy he doesn't come to say oh you know i just want to be your buddy and your friend and i really like you and you're a cool personality he wants to kill you that's it it's life or death and why you fight it's life and death it doesn't change never not one thought that you get into your head is life or death every time yeah so i'm gonna go to that sorry i get very passionate about this but this has been cooking so much i oh amen um so let's go to ephesians 6 and this is where i want to touch because now he says we don't wrestle against flesh and blood our fight is not between brothers and sisters people out there unbelievers no believers make believers real believers fake believers whatever you want to it's not it's see this is not a human affair brother isaac preached it so well we're not part of this fight and if there's an unbeliever that walks past you and he kicks your bucket and says i don't believe in god you shouldn't get upset about it he's an unbeliever to begin with he he doesn't believe what ground do you have on to say you must believe in jesus christ and be saved or you're going to go to hell what ground do you have to stand on we know this but he's an unbeliever so for him even if you said that or gave him the whole bible to read if he doesn't believe it he doesn't believe it so don't try to change people pray for those people but but see the fight now because he's put forth the challenge god doesn't exist doesn't exist god is not real but what are you going to do are you going to go back to your training don't hit him with the sword just first get that shield up and say lord i'm not fighting a brother i'm not fighting a person i'm fighting a spirit amen it's a spiritual warfare it's got nothing to do with men and it's just a manifestation it's where it comes out it just manifests in near this realm but it's a spiritual warfare we were created in the image of god not in the image of man so let's go to ephesians 6 amen and i need my phone for that one so ephesians 6 and we'll start there at verse 12 and it says for you wrestle not against flesh and blood or against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now he says this is not your fight but let me just tell you what you need to do this fight take you there for the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand so basically show up to the battle yeah god say i'm losing a battle but but you're standing there and i'm going on i'm fine tonight i might not just go to church tonight and i just don't feel really nice satan don't want you here yeah you rather want you lying on your bed watching a story or reading your favorite book or taking a time out he doesn't want you here because he is where the war really happens here's where god gives you something that hits you here in your soul and you go that's that's a bit hard i don't know if i can eat that but because i'm a real christian i'll take it back to him say okay lord lord they said no brother months it not tonight i should bring my bible and i think he aimed it a bit against me and and you know why would he say that but take it back to him because if you take it back to him your answer is going to come but it will come because he's not a god of confusion he says the um to withstand the emotion having all done all to stand and here we go is he stand there for having your loins girted with the truth and having the brace braid of righteousness and here's where i made a little footnote he says and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace so preparation is to make one ready for a sermon is to make you ready to receive something you're preparing before you come here you don't stroll in the door here and come and sit down and just receive because then if you look at the the parable with jesus speak about the sower your the seat that is sowed it either falls in prepared ground or hard ground and the birds will eat it up so it's no point coming to church and you're not prepared to receive something brother isaac said something tonight he says i'm ready to receive something and it's not me because he comes with the expectation and he wants that expectation to be made so if you don't come prepared you will not receive anything because no pastor can preach you into heaven god can get you there if you want to really surrender it is a it's a take and give hey it's a it's a deal purpose it's a two two way it's not a one way okay we respond to god god responds back to us or god responds to us we respond back to him it's not god tells us what he's doing yes lord god bless you sister here we go i have to act this way god bless your sister you see it's not that way god doesn't make robots he's persons we're persons man with people with affections i'll get back on my thoughts sorry but remember the preparation because when you pray up and you come prepared and you really want to get your blessing no matter what comes over this pulpit you'll get your blessing you will not leave here until he blesses you he says and in fear and and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all things take the shield of faith where you shall withstand and be able to quench all all the fiery darts of the wicked amen not some all the fiery darts that means you don't need to take one thought the devil gives you that means you have a choice to take or to let go it lies with you so i'm going to come back i'll come back to that and then he says all the thoughts the the all the dots of the the wicked you can call them farts if you want to as well because there's nothing there he's just a bluff he's just it's just a thought you can take it you can do whatever you want it's just a thought he's already been defeated there's nothing of substance that can hurt you there no matter what he sees it's a thought don't see it for anything more than a thought that comes into your head he says and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and in verse 18 praying always and with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto for all perseverance he says and that perseverance it says perseverance is doing something despite the difficulty or delay in achieving success resolve remember that we just spoke about it is when you say in your heart i will push this battle even if it costs my life not against someone but against one person wins one fallen angel which is created held on earth and is actually thinking he's going to achieve a victory he will not because he's already been defeated just put him in his place just put him in his place he is a defeated being that's that's how it is he says and this is where brother ben said something he says and for me that utterance may be given unto me and that i might open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel the mystery of the gospel which is not a mystery anymore for which i am an ambassador in bonds brother ben we're ambassadors that means when god sent you to this earth he put all authority from heaven and earth behind you and you preached that and i thought wow how did you just get that from yeah i started that one i'm just saying because you represent the kingdom of heaven now how's satan gonna let you just stand yeah because you're his enemy because basically you said i'm gonna follow jesus that right yeah and he's gonna go oh yeah yeah you say say me okay but i'm going to show you because now when you didn't follow um who came out of the world brother james when you didn't fall follow jesus how easy was it it's easy life's easy man i can do what i want sister jenny we can do what we want we can we can we adults we can do whatever we want come on man i'll come out of the world i know it took a lot to get me a praise the lord but we're going but i could do anything and nothing was a limitation nothing nothing could stop me i was unstoppable i was i was just young and vibrant and i could do whatever i wanted to do but the day when i chose jesus christ three days later they broke into my house i'm like hey what's this luckily they stole my tv they stole my playstation they saw all the things that was distracting me from the gospel praise the lord they had to he had to because he had to clean everything out okay so praise the lord he's good but now i want to speak about the part of the sermon and and i'm almost i'm well i'm not about to close but we're going to try to close this one so you got the part of the sermon i said it in the sunday school meeting so we have a choice so here's our pot i don't have a pot i usually like props but okay you've got a part of the sermon so there's a big pot cooking one of brother andy's big curry pots okay so now the thought comes in momo doesn't like you he looks strangely at you sorry mom i'm like your dad i like using examples he's god bless you brother and now you think whoa you know maybe he doesn't like me stop right there why don't you just first catch that thought because the bible says you should take every thought into captivity every thought catch it and now before you put it in here just catch it and go let's put it in the pot and boil it a bit yeah don't entertain it boil it okay because satan is going to boil it's going to burn in like a fire so boiler boil it and go okay is it adding to my faith is it bringing me closer to momo is it bring giving me love is it making me feel alright okay is it is it actually helping me in my walk with the lord no leave it in the pot okay just leave it let it boil okay now you walk in and god says he says to you i want you to talk to that person about jesus christ and you get to the person you say i love jesus christ the guy goes i don't believe you quit grab the fort it's okay throw it in the pot okay i really want to slap that guy because he named you used the name of the lord in vain i do not like that i honestly don't like it why don't they use muhammad and all those other names why always jesus christ so now i get angry now now it plays in my emotional realm now i'm actually starting to manifest something in you it's boiling in me don't let it boil in you take the thought out throw it in the pot say okay this guy doesn't like jesus is that adding to my faith no it's not is it helping me to get closer to god no it's not is it helping him to get closer to god no it's not i'll pray for you yeah there we go so you left that you left the emotion you left the heat you left everything in the pot so when i buy a new game and i can preach games because i played games and you open the cover and it's death and murder and shooting and screaming and take the game and throw it in the pot and then you say does this honor god does it honor god is it bringing me closer to god is it adding to my faith is it helping my faith is it bringing me closer to my brother and sister no leave it in the pot don't entertain it don't take it it's not for you it's just a trick of the devil anything that you get in your head put it in the pot and let it boil because what happens is when we start reasoning and this is what eve done and i'm gonna go into that now and i'm sorry i get very emotional when i think about this thing it says but god gave his word the first place a man can't even come to he can't sin hallelujah now this is here this is the word of god when you hit behind it he said here it is this is coming fresh oh man a man cannot sin first unless he casts aside the word of god he cannot even sin and he has no uh and or disbelieve it he has to first disbelieve the word of god he has to get rid of that um and then and then the praise and of the presence of god and then sorry i messed that up i said he can't even sin that's disbelief until he first gets rid of the word of god the presence of god he cannot sin so when you're behind the word of god you're in the presence of god it's impossible for you to sin impossible and now he brings it into even he says eve could not sin until she laid aside the word of god and she opened up the channels of reasoning through her soul and she became to reason he began to reason why certainly my husband never told me these things i believe you he told it to me and he said i shouldn't do this but you know it makes real good sense explain so of course what she said is when he said surely and then he said because you'll be as gods now it's starting to reason but she didn't grab that thought and just go throw it in the pot and goes okay hold on okay just give me a sec god said if i eat from that tree that's me this guy says surely i'll be like a god i don't want to be like a god i just want to worship him i just want to stay behind this word you know what it's not for me that was god's provided way but that portion is not for me and she moved on and left it in the pot but she didn't and that had to happen for a reason he says there has to be a place selected and this is where our battle belongs this is brother branham saying the battle is the mind he says it's a mutual ground and no man's land and they fight here at this place they don't they just don't fight over here or down there or run to here or over there this is the this is the battlefront where men meet to our regard me to meet the uh test their powers where each enemy tested strength against the other enemy a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when this great battle started on earth it had to have a mutual meeting place and there had to be a place selected for this battle to begin and for this battle to rage and the battlegrounds begin in the human mind that is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for that place of that battle where it is to begin and that is because that the senior decision was already made from the mind and the head and now i'll finish up with this thought so here here we've got the battle the battlefield is the mine now i'm going to use the example so if we go to the book of joshua you don't need to go there i just need to go there quickly joshua and i think it was chapter 5. joshua is standing here yeah verse 13. he's standing here and he's looking at jericho okay now remember in the first chapter of the book of joshua god says wherever your souls of your feet goes that's yours yours it's a promise it's yours healing yours overcoming power is yours holy ghost is yours all those promises is yours but i need you to do something i need you to show up for the battle so here goes joshua he wakes up the morning and he walks and and i'm just going to dramatize it a bit so please bear with me i don't know the chapter that well but i i know the story because i love it and he comes and he stands and he looks at the walls of jericho and he goes oh dear now i know god's promise i know god can't lie well those walls are pretty big and now satan comes satan goes see those walls are pretty big you know it took me 150 years to build those walls i knew you were coming yeah i prepared those walls those walls are just for you and i know that you you cannot go past those walls it's impossible for you to go past those walls see he's not talking about what god can do he's telling what joshua can't do yes joshua cannot human break those walls down his army isn't even an army that has the right equipment to break the walls down and joshua stands he goes yep sounds about right he says and those walls are thick they can run chariots on those walls yep sounds about right cool and he says so i'm just going to say your campaign is going to stop here what god said in the beginning is just not going to be fulfilled and he goes okay takes the thought throws it in the pot and he starts walking and he goes lord it's true devil says it's impossible but with you nothing's impossible and he keeps wondering he's keeping thinking about the lord and what the lord has done and lord we have crossed the jordan lord it was dry ground lord every step i take i've conquered the enemy where's the difference he started having a testimony service to himself saying what lord has done in his life so now he's taking that very thought and he's discerning it and he's saying but wait this is not adding to my faith so i let her tell you what is adding to my faith what adds to my faith is god has delivered me god has gotten me this far he will take me the rest of the way and all of a sudden he looks in front of him and there's a man and he stands with a sword in his hand amen and joshua looks at him because remember he's having this battle and he goes are you for us or against us that's right and he says no the place you're standing on is holy ground amen he says and now i'm going to remind you of something i made a promise amen i keep my promise i came to take over see he had to discern that thought so now the devil comes to you and says you can't have your healing you can't win this battle your family is not yours they're not safe where they are i got their lives in my hand what are you doing with a sword you got now two choices you can give it life or you can kill it right there so isn't that where we should be as christians is when everything hits our head to this first throw in the pot and say lord i don't understand your word i don't know everything i'm worried about my mom and dad but you know what you got the battle you already won the war so i'll just come and stand in your camp for a while i'll show up for the battle i'll fight the devil but i need you to do the campaign i need you to win the war oh lord amen amen and he says here he says and the captain of the host seek to him unto joshua loose thy shoe for the of thy foot the place where you stand is holy and joshua did so and he says and the lord said unto joshua see i have given it into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor joshua just had to show up for the battle amen always belong to the lord and i'll finish with this the brains of the army lies in its captains the intelligence he says rommel in germany was the brains behind germany not hitler rommel that's right eisenhower military man those men were on the front line and the men that were on the front line depended on which way they gave the order you follow the captain if he is that right kind of general if he's the right kind if he's a four-star general if he's proved and he's been proven to be right follow him though it might seem wrong it might seem wrong to you go to the front do as you're told he says hallelujah we've got a five-star general spell j-e-s-u-s place five stars on him faith f-a-i-t-h he never lost a battle and he will never lose a battle so whatever the devil tells you let the five-star general have the final say okay amen so i think after that we can go into a word of prayer because there's many things that happens brother ben i don't know if you want to have some announcements or anything if there's any pre-requests don't you don't need to tell me the lord sees your battle rebecca he sees it it's real yep emily glenn and maya we've got a five-star general there's a brother that's got cancer or kidney failure brother cyril doctor says he's got a week what does the physician say look in this sermon or maybe just bring the scene in the sermon brother branham opens and he needs a a woman a sister bell and he and and she comes and they come with a prerequisite for this sister bell and he says there's another sister and the sister's name was um oh give me a sec i need to catch that give me i need to put this this is gonna just and he says i need to pray for the sister give me a sec i want to get it right amen it's a sister belle and a sister shepherd so the prayer request comes in he has to pray for sister shepherd now don't lose the thought remember god is doing the work and he says he climbs out of his bed and he says the message came from sister bell i have to pray for sister shepherd she's very sick and we have to intercede so he goes on his knees and he prays for sister shepherd and the next morning the news comes back sister bellas passed away and the message got to him wrong it was supposed to sister shepard said he has to pray for sister bell and he says this he says to this morning we are one soldier laced fighting the army we are one less one weaker finding the army one weaker he says she's a believer she went into glory and she will get a reward but we're one weaker so souls matter in this fight and see your prayers matter so even if brother cyril is having kidney failure and the doctor sees this out we can intercede we've got a living god he healed back then he heals back now he does not change don't let doubt come in your head now you've got two choices you can believe that word or you can put the rest of it in the thing and the pot and let it burn but don't doubt because the moment you doubt you have no foundation i'm not saying work yourself up just trust god can do it because he is there the sword's drawn he showed up it's holy ground he's here he says with two or more gathering my name i'm there he's here ask what you want ask what you want don't smoke small things ask big things are things with eternal value are things that matter my family's in south africa they're going through turmoil america is burning this whole world's falling apart ask and step in so if you have a burner for someone tonight pray for them pray for them and ask god to intercede because it's only him that can take the fight it's not us we're just ambassadors we've sent the word back to the king saying we need reinforcements let him send it but just hold your ground hold your ground no matter what you do tonight hold your ground drive that that land draw it in the sand draw that line in the sand and take your stance because your enemy can't go past that night amen conquer past that night amen so let's all stand up and let's address the king tonight and if it's for yourself pray don't be ashamed you children never be ashamed from praying out loud amen because i'll tell you something the devil can't hear in your heart he can't discern the intent of the heart he doesn't have that sword he can't he can't listen richie in your heart he doesn't know so if you pray very softly the lord can hear you it's fine but your enemy is not getting addressed brother andy said i was brushing my teeth and then he starts throwing dots at me why why because i can't speak i can't tell him where he belongs so he'll come to you every time you have yourself busy but don't think you can think him out of your head it's impossible you have to address him with your words the word of god speak it and he'll flee he can't he'll come back he'll try you again so look at the war this is the war this is the battle you might have many little battles but this is one this is done eh so don't don't concentrate on this yes show up for this but let him do this say amen at least just close our eyes our gracious heavenly father we love you so much lord are we going to come tonight and speak to that captain of the host father lord for this many sick and afflicted lord there's many people lord looking for their families
