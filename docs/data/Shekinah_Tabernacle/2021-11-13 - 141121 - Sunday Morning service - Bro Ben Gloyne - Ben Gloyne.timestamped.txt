[5:26] you are feeling breathless it could be
[5:27] asthma
[5:28] could be asthma it could be tb he's not
[5:32] sure
[5:33] and sometimes they make mistakes
[5:35] you get given the wrong medication and
[5:37] it makes you worse
[5:39] because it's only a human doctor
[5:41] but now when you come to dr jesus
[5:44] he just says tell me what you want
[5:46] it's not that he doesn't know

[56:24] a sea of glass mingled with fire and
[56:26] them that had gotten the victory over
[56:28] the beast and over his image and over
[56:30] his mark and over the number of his name
[56:33] stand on the sea of glass having the
[56:35] hearts of god and they sing the song of
[56:38] moses the servant of god in the song of
[56:40] the lamb saying great and marvelous of
[56:42] thy works lord god almighty just and
[56:44] true are thy ways thou king of saints

[57:17] it says whosoever believeth that jesus
[57:21] is the christ is born of god and
[57:23] everyone that loveth him that lo that
[57:26] beget loveth him sorry and everyone that
[57:29] loveth him that beget loveth him also
[57:32] that is begotten of him
[57:34] by this we know that we love the
[57:36] children of god when we love god and
[57:38] keep his commandments for this is the
[57:40] love of god that we keep his
[57:41] commandments and his commandments are
[57:43] not grievous
[57:44] for whosoever is born of god overcometh
[57:47] the world and this is the victory that
[57:50] overcometh the world even our faith
[57:54] who is he that believer sorry who is he
[57:56] that overcometh the world but he that
[57:58] believeth that jesus is the son of god
[58:02] and we're going to judges just one verse
[58:04] in judges three and the last i believe
[58:06] it's the last verse of of chapter 3
[58:10] which is verse 31
[58:16] and
[58:17] it says an after him
[58:19] was shamgar
[58:21] the son of anath you know the prophet
[58:23] says that there's only one scripture
[58:24] written about sham gaba that's enough
[58:26] when you like one scripture written
[58:27] about you there's actually a whole book
[58:29] written about you
[58:30] and type and shadow reflecting you but
[58:32] says here and after him was shamgar the
[58:34] son of anath which slew of the
[58:36] philistines 600 men with an ox goad and
[58:39] he also delivered israel

[1:00:19] we thank you lord in jesus christ's name
[1:00:22] amen amen amen god bless your friends
[1:00:24] you may have your seats uh this morning
[1:00:27] the prince of the lord i'd like to speak
[1:00:29] about when you realize you're standing
[1:00:31] in victory
[1:00:33] hallelujah because you know we are stan
[1:00:35] the bride is standing in victory this
[1:00:37] morning
[1:00:38] hallelujah so now we read there in uh
[1:00:41] revelations 15 of a group of people and
[1:00:44] we know that they are the 144 000
[1:00:46] because they sing the uh song of moses
[1:00:50] and the song of the lamb which is this
[1:00:51] is what the jews will sing but you know
[1:00:54] it says that they have gotten the
[1:00:55] victory over his image over the beast
[1:00:58] you know over his mark and the number of
[1:01:00] his name so gotten the victory is a is a
[1:01:02] past tense thing and it's very it's very
[1:01:05] wonderful to look back you know we could
[1:01:07] have a testimony really a testimony
[1:01:09] service is when we look at how god gave
[1:01:11] us the victory in the past
[1:01:13] right so we can look back and say god
[1:01:15] gave us the victory there but it's
[1:01:17] incredible when we can realize that we
[1:01:19] are standing in victory you may be in
[1:01:21] the worst part of your life right now
[1:01:22] the biggest battle the hardest time ever
[1:01:26] of your christian journey but if you can
[1:01:27] realize you have the victory in the
[1:01:29] battle
[1:01:30] that you already have the victory amen
[1:01:31] that then i believe the burden will be
[1:01:33] lighter you can rejoice knowing that
[1:01:35] you've already won amen that you are
[1:01:37] going to come out packing the victory
[1:01:39] because you are living in victory
[1:01:42] because i believe victory is not just a
[1:01:44] condition but it's a state of being
[1:01:46] hallelujah and i believe the bride this
[1:01:48] morning right now is living in victory
[1:01:52] amen so i trust that this will just lift
[1:01:54] a few burdens we can go shouting even
[1:01:56] even even in the greatest battle because
[1:01:58] remember being being victorious does not
[1:02:00] make the devil go away
[1:02:02] right he you know we we are not built
[1:02:05] just to rejoice when everything's good
[1:02:07] but we should be able to conduct
[1:02:08] ourselves as sons and daughters of god
[1:02:11] in the greatest trials
[1:02:12] that's our privilege to to hold have our
[1:02:14] shoulders back our heads held high
[1:02:16] thanking god that he's got it all in
[1:02:18] control
[1:02:19] and we face a defeated being this
[1:02:21] morning
[1:02:22] now
[1:02:24] i um uh we didn't read it but you know
[1:02:26] first you have to get victory within
[1:02:27] yourself before you can live in victory
[1:02:30] right so this is not just a well-eye
[1:02:32] victory but first you got to get victory
[1:02:33] within yourself now what i mean by this
[1:02:36] is that you've got to be you yeah i
[1:02:38] trust that as believers you can look
[1:02:40] back in a time of your life where you
[1:02:42] wrestled with the angel of the lord like
[1:02:44] jacob did and he changed you
[1:02:46] that's how you get victory within
[1:02:47] yourself
[1:02:49] right so you know we won't read it but
[1:02:50] but jacob you know he came to a spot in
[1:02:52] his life
[1:02:54] where where you know he was going back
[1:02:56] to meet his brother and we know that we
[1:02:58] we do reap what we sow
[1:02:59] and you know he he he showed a few
[1:03:02] things he was about to reap but you know
[1:03:04] god was god was in control of the
[1:03:06] situation because god allows things to
[1:03:08] come into our life that it's only us and
[1:03:10] him
[1:03:10] he will he will make conditions come
[1:03:12] into our life where we can't turn to
[1:03:14] nothing else there's no more excuses we
[1:03:16] can put our hands on or this person this
[1:03:18] one or this but it's you and him alone
[1:03:21] and because god had to change jacob from
[1:03:24] jacob to israel a prince with god we
[1:03:26] know jacob means supplanter and he
[1:03:28] tricked his brother tricked everyone
[1:03:29] around about him but then it came to a
[1:03:31] place where god said you can't you can't
[1:03:33] live by that name anymore because we
[1:03:35] know a name represents a life
[1:03:37] right you think of moses you think of
[1:03:39] the life moses lived you think elijah
[1:03:41] the life elijah lived jesus you think
[1:03:43] the life he lived you know the apostle
[1:03:45] paul the life he lived it's because it's
[1:03:46] in a name
[1:03:47] right so that's why his name had to be
[1:03:49] changed because god didn't want to
[1:03:51] continue on as a supplanter twisting the
[1:03:54] truth changing facts to try and get
[1:03:55] advantage over people you know
[1:03:57] embellishing things diminishing things
[1:03:59] half lies white lies whatever color lie
[1:04:02] you know trying to that's being a
[1:04:03] supplanter but god doesn't want us to be
[1:04:05] like that god wants wants us to be
[1:04:07] princes and princesses with god
[1:04:10] so you know jacob sent his family sent
[1:04:12] his livestock before him before because
[1:04:15] esau was on the other side of the river
[1:04:16] with i think 400 men and you know and
[1:04:19] and um you know jacob did not have any
[1:04:21] form of an army or you know he didn't
[1:04:22] know what was going to happen he thought
[1:04:24] if he just sends gifts trying to buy
[1:04:26] favor
[1:04:27] and this is what the world is full of
[1:04:28] these days trying to buy a favor brother
[1:04:29] ram says you can't buy friends
[1:04:31] you know people send money at billions
[1:04:33] of dollars overseas and try and buy a
[1:04:35] country's friendship it don't work
[1:04:37] right that's not what we should be doing
[1:04:39] but you know well two degree but anyway
[1:04:42] well you know we should see they didn't
[1:04:43] help one another you know what i mean
[1:04:44] but yeah you can't buy friendship that's
[1:04:45] what i'm trying to get it but you see so
[1:04:47] jacob came to a point where it was him
[1:04:49] and god alone
[1:04:51] and he wrestled with the angel of the
[1:04:53] lord until god changed him
[1:04:55] and that's what will happen god will
[1:04:57] allow pressure to come on in our lives
[1:05:00] he can even cause us to lose everything
[1:05:02] but in order to get our attention
[1:05:05] that there will be nothing but us and
[1:05:06] him but we have to hold on to him until
[1:05:09] we have been changed by him
[1:05:12] amen so god wants to wrestle with you in
[1:05:14] prayer in order that you lay your entire
[1:05:17] life down you surrender your entire will
[1:05:19] your entire heart that he changes you
[1:05:21] like he did jacob this is what he does
[1:05:23] with does with every believer yeah
[1:05:25] because he touched his thigh and he
[1:05:27] walked with a limp from that moment on
[1:05:28] so his life that he lived his walk in
[1:05:31] this world was changed because god
[1:05:33] touched him i mean maybe the next day
[1:05:35] when he when he when he crosses the
[1:05:37] river or whatever you know and you know
[1:05:38] goes to his family they could ask him
[1:05:40] what happened to you he said i've been
[1:05:41] touched by the angel of god now my walk
[1:05:44] is different he didn't need to say
[1:05:45] anything his walk was different he
[1:05:47] couldn't walk the same way i mean then
[1:05:50] from before because his life had been
[1:05:52] changed it's the same thing with you and
[1:05:53] i when god truly comes into our life not
[1:05:56] just being religious not just trying to
[1:05:57] be a better person but when god fills
[1:06:00] you with the with his presence with the
[1:06:01] baptism of the holy ghost you don't need
[1:06:03] to tell anyone everyone will see it
[1:06:06] hallelujah amen people will see a
[1:06:08] difference you know i remember when you
[1:06:10] know
[1:06:11] uh when i was at university and i you
[1:06:13] know i worked part-time in a kitchen and
[1:06:15] you know and but during that time i met
[1:06:17] the lord and then so chris and i got
[1:06:19] married and you know she worked there in
[1:06:20] the kitchen a little bit and um you know
[1:06:22] i didn't i didn't tell the people i
[1:06:24] worked with and i'd known them for about
[1:06:25] six years i didn't tell them i'd become
[1:06:28] a christian meet the lord but but their
[1:06:30] testimony was we are so happy when this
[1:06:33] is what they said to christine we're so
[1:06:35] happy when ben met his god because
[1:06:37] before he was empty he was depressed he
[1:06:39] was down but now he's different
[1:06:41] what happened i wrestle with an angel
[1:06:43] the angel wrestled with me rather he
[1:06:45] says you can't live the same kind of
[1:06:47] life you got to be changed
[1:06:49] hallelujah so you know jacob was changed
[1:06:52] to israel and you say when that happened
[1:06:54] he got the victory
[1:06:56] now he was living in victory beforehand
[1:06:59] he was trying to have victory by his own
[1:07:01] schemes
[1:07:02] but then afterwards he was living a
[1:07:04] victory because god had changed his life
[1:07:06] we don't want to be living in victory
[1:07:08] because of our own schemes and what we
[1:07:09] can work out that's being a supplanter
[1:07:12] right we want to be living in victory
[1:07:14] because god has changed our lives
[1:07:17] are you in that condition today
[1:07:19] i trust you are brother i'm saying the
[1:07:21] door inside the door in 1958 he says
[1:07:24] see but if god will just speak to your
[1:07:26] heart and open that door that your eyes
[1:07:29] can see that he's here and his goodness
[1:07:32] he will load you with it
[1:07:34] my prayer is that you'll open your heart
[1:07:36] tonight and i'll say this morning your
[1:07:39] understanding open your heart of faith
[1:07:41] open the door to the selfishness open
[1:07:44] the door to indifference open the door
[1:07:47] of malice that's in your heart and let
[1:07:49] christ come in
[1:07:51] and be the full lord and governor of
[1:07:53] your life
[1:07:54] he says let us pray with heads bowed
[1:07:57] pardon me eternal and blessed god such a
[1:07:59] wonderful audience we could just speak
[1:08:01] similarly all night but the hour is
[1:08:03] moving on we thank thee that thou dost

[1:08:21] us if we've got pride you'll discuss
[1:08:23] that
[1:08:24] give us a cure if it's sickness thou art
[1:08:26] the great physician standing at the door
[1:08:28] knocking if it's a lack of understanding
[1:08:31] you'll open our eyes if any man lacks
[1:08:33] wisdom let him ask god that's the
[1:08:35] scripture father and we believe it to be
[1:08:37] thy truth i pray god that just now that
[1:08:40] you'll knock at many hearts those every
[1:08:42] heart that has a need may your holy
[1:08:44] spirit at the door now knock and say
[1:08:46] child or man
[1:08:47] open up your door and i'll come in and
[1:08:49] discuss this problem with you if you
[1:08:51] want more grace i'll give it to you if
[1:08:54] you want more faith i'll give it to you
[1:08:56] if you want your eyes of understanding
[1:08:58] to be opened i have sell for them
[1:09:00] i'm the great physician i'm the one who
[1:09:02] keep kept the israelites food all
[1:09:04] through the 40 years of journey i
[1:09:06] preserved their clothing till they never
[1:09:08] went thread bear that's what i mean by
[1:09:12] by wrestling with god in prayer you you
[1:09:14] wrestle with him you open your heart he
[1:09:15] comes in and discusses your problems
[1:09:17] with you and he's the one who fixes it
[1:09:19] he's the one who makes it right
[1:09:22] hallelujah that's and and then once that
[1:09:24] happens hey you're changed
[1:09:27] amen when god steps in
[1:09:29] and changes your life amen you are
[1:09:31] changed
[1:09:32] hallelujah
[1:09:34] now brother brahm says in victory day
[1:09:36] and you know if you want to hear a good
[1:09:38] sermon listen to victory day 1963. he
[1:09:41] says what the church needs to do is to
[1:09:43] do like jacob pray till you get a v-day
[1:09:45] which is victory day and right jacob had
[1:09:48] a wrestling party he wrestled all night
[1:09:50] long with the lord but he said i'm not
[1:09:51] going to let you go until i get this
[1:09:53] victory then about daylight one morning
[1:09:56] he had a v-day he didn't walk the same
[1:09:58] anymore but on his side he was see on
[1:10:00] this side this before he met the angel
[1:10:02] he was a great big strong fearful church
[1:10:05] member but on the other side this is
[1:10:07] after he was touched by the angel he was
[1:10:09] a little limping prince
[1:10:11] i mean with enough courage to fight the
[1:10:14] whole army esau said i'll furnish you an
[1:10:16] army he said i don't need it he had a
[1:10:18] v-day
[1:10:20] we don't need the organizations we don't
[1:10:22] need their stuff for this world we don't
[1:10:24] need i mean to have the tally and the
[1:10:26] things of this world we've had we've had
[1:10:29] a v-day we wrestled one day or one night
[1:10:33] um oh
[1:10:34] remember how i wrestled i then when i
[1:10:36] had to die to myself but there come a
[1:10:39] v-day
[1:10:41] amen when i got the victory amen when
[1:10:43] god's word become right the baptist
[1:10:45] church to me was no more than any other
[1:10:47] organization that's right i had a v-day
[1:10:50] god's word is right
[1:10:51] amen and when you have that victory day
[1:10:54] amen when you diet to yourself when the
[1:10:56] word becomes your real absolute becomes
[1:10:58] your foundation amen god comes and lives
[1:11:01] in your life now you're living in
[1:11:03] victory
[1:11:04] i mean so there's some of you here have
[1:11:06] not had that time with the angel amen
[1:11:09] you get a hold of him he's here
[1:11:11] he
[1:11:12] there's already situations in life where
[1:11:14] he's trying to get your attention
[1:11:15] i mean you should you should turn to him
[1:11:17] and say lord i want to hold on to you
[1:11:19] till you change me i need victory i need
[1:11:21] a permanent victory
[1:11:23] hallelujah he's here to give you that
[1:11:25] victory yes amen
[1:11:27] amen now so we realized so so for the
[1:11:30] believer now we're now living in victory
[1:11:32] amen amen and we have to realize that so
[1:11:36] because there's a big difference
[1:11:38] between
[1:11:39] praying to get victory
[1:11:42] which is what jacob had to do then
[1:11:44] praying from victory
[1:11:46] right because remember we are i trust as
[1:11:48] a believer on the other side where now
[1:11:50] you're now walking in victory because
[1:11:53] god is now in you now
[1:11:54] we have to realize that if if you're
[1:11:56] standing in victory
[1:11:58] then you are already victorious
[1:12:02] and you're fighting an enemy from a
[1:12:04] position
[1:12:05] that you are victorious already over him
[1:12:07] right he's a defeated foe
[1:12:10] right he's a defeated foe
[1:12:11] there'll still be a contest
[1:12:14] you know the devil doesn't quit
[1:12:16] the devil doesn't quit he knows he has
[1:12:18] but a short time right he knows he's
[1:12:20] going to burn in the lake of fire he
[1:12:22] fights it with everything within him
[1:12:23] he's very determined but he you know he
[1:12:26] doesn't just quit
[1:12:28] when when abraham was told by god your
[1:12:30] seed is going to sojourn in a strange
[1:12:32] land being egypt then i'm going to bring
[1:12:33] them here with a mighty hand you know
[1:12:35] the devil didn't quit he didn't inspire
[1:12:38] all the people of those lands just to
[1:12:39] leave now he began to inspire them to
[1:12:41] build jericho build the wall so thick
[1:12:44] that the chariot race could go around
[1:12:45] and fortify the people anoint them to
[1:12:47] make armies and things because the devil
[1:12:49] is going to put up a fight
[1:12:51] it's the same thing with you and i god
[1:12:53] touches your life one time the devil
[1:12:54] don't quit he doesn't wave a flag of
[1:12:57] yo's flag of strength to say well i
[1:12:58] might as well leave that one alone now
[1:13:00] that's when he puts your his guns upon
[1:13:02] you i mean but you've got to realize you
[1:13:04] have victory over that weapon
[1:13:06] hallelujah as it says in isaiah no
[1:13:09] weapon formed against you shall prosper
[1:13:12] why is that because you're standing in
[1:13:13] victory there'll still be battles
[1:13:15] there's still my you know you're going
[1:13:17] to realize every mind battle shall not
[1:13:19] prosper you're above that thing you know
[1:13:21] jesus has the name above every name so
[1:13:24] everything that can be named that name
[1:13:26] is beneath the name of jesus christ amen
[1:13:29] he has been lifted so high we're going
[1:13:30] gonna look up into the heavens and see
[1:13:32] he's been lifted up so high far above
[1:13:34] all principality power demon power
[1:13:37] sickness disease complex a past whatever
[1:13:41] it is our lord jesus being lifted up
[1:13:43] high above all those things but you've
[1:13:45] got to recognize we are you are a joint
[1:13:48] heir
[1:13:48] with jesus christ so if he's been lifted
[1:13:51] high above all things if you're a joiner
[1:13:52] you've been lifted up with him above
[1:13:55] every problem you may be facing he is in
[1:13:58] a victorious position and because we are
[1:14:00] joint here with him we are victorious as
[1:14:02] well you have got to realize this thing
[1:14:05] whatever demon power whatever thing is
[1:14:07] fighting your complex you're greater
[1:14:08] than the complex you're above the
[1:14:10] complex i mean whatever demon spirit may
[1:14:13] be moving whatever's whatever's fighting
[1:14:15] you right now you're above it
[1:14:17] because you've been lifted up above that
[1:14:19] thing
[1:14:20] hallelujah why we are victorious because
[1:14:23] he has made us victorious
[1:14:26] we need to realize that we cannot defeat
[1:14:28] the devil in our own strength
[1:14:30] man has tried to outsmart him for
[1:14:32] thousands of years and every time those
[1:14:34] men have failed
[1:14:36] so we can't defeat him in our own human
[1:14:38] ability it doesn't matter how much we
[1:14:40] know the message no we know the
[1:14:41] scripture how we can put it all together
[1:14:43] human abilities failure to begin with
[1:14:46] the prophet says that we are failures to
[1:14:48] begin with because we're born in sin
[1:14:50] shaped inequity come to the world
[1:14:51] speaking lies doesn't matter how good
[1:14:53] you are your intentions may be good you
[1:14:55] always fail but if god steps in
[1:14:59] then you're victorious if the victorious
[1:15:01] one steps into your life then you'll
[1:15:03] have the victory
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:09] the prophet says this he says he
[1:15:10] conquered the gate of temptation by the
[1:15:12] word this is the lord jesus
[1:15:14] remember we he said there's a promise
[1:15:16] that thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:15:19] the enemy
[1:15:20] and that promise was passed down through
[1:15:22] the through the scriptures
[1:15:24] he conquered the gate of temptation by
[1:15:26] the word and the key was resist the
[1:15:28] enemy and he'll flee from you he
[1:15:30] conquered it all he conquered every
[1:15:32] sickness he conquered death he conquered
[1:15:34] hell he conquered death in hell he
[1:15:36] conquered what the others couldn't

[1:15:39] seed this is a spiritual seed he
[1:15:42] conquered the gates of the grave and
[1:15:43] rose up on the third day for our
[1:15:45] justification and now we're more than
[1:15:47] conquerors we're just we just walk right
[1:15:51] into it as an inheritance more than
[1:15:53] conquerors now we're dealing with a
[1:15:55] defeated enemy

[1:16:02] say complexes are defeated regret's

[1:16:15] conquerors that if you're more than a
[1:16:17] conqueror you're living in
[1:16:18] victory we can stand right now in this
[1:16:21] present evil age and overcome
[1:16:25] hallelujah that's why we read there in
[1:16:26] first john 5 our faith overcometh the
[1:16:29] world so we may be standing in the
[1:16:31] darkest age there's ever been but we are
[1:16:32] victory and we already have within us
[1:16:35] the faith the revelation to overcome
[1:16:37] that's why you got to realize don't be
[1:16:39] intimidated by the devil sure he's
[1:16:42] intimidating he's a bluff he'll try and
[1:16:44] scare us do whatever he can but don't be
[1:16:46] intimidated by him
[1:16:48] you gotta say boo back yes
[1:16:51] and you know there's a variant of uh
[1:16:53] delta called boo
[1:16:54] apparently
[1:16:56] i say boo hoo
[1:16:58] we don't need to fear anything
[1:17:01] amen why because we're victorious god's
[1:17:03] made us victorious it's not you making
[1:17:05] yourself victorious see see we're going
[1:17:07] to get our you know we put pressure on
[1:17:09] ourselves to overcome no if he overcame
[1:17:12] and he's in us he'll overcome through
[1:17:14] you you've just got to let go and let
[1:17:16] god have his way amen
[1:17:18] amen we're dealing with now where were

[1:17:24] everything is defeated oh my i wish i
[1:17:27] was twice my size then maybe i feel
[1:17:29] twice as good i mean we are disputing
[1:17:31] with a conquered enemy no wonder paul
[1:17:34] could say when he was when they were
[1:17:36] building a block to chop his head off
[1:17:37] said oh death where is your sting show
[1:17:40] me where you can make me squirmer and
[1:17:42] scream grave where's your victory
[1:17:44] and you think you'll mold me out there i

[1:17:49] empty tomb there and i am in him he'll
[1:17:51] raise me up for the last day a defeated
[1:17:53] enemy the royal seed of abraham now the
[1:17:56] natural seed could not point to that but
[1:17:58] the royal seed can conquer already
[1:18:00] conquered for he has gone before us and
[1:18:02] conquered every gate for us he is now
[1:18:05] after two thousand years he stands in
[1:18:07] the midst of us the mighty conqueror not

[1:18:13] enemy he conquered death he conquered
[1:18:15] hell he conquered the grave and rose up
[1:18:17] again and two thousand years later here

[1:18:21] say this morning identifying himself the
[1:18:24] mighty conqueror amen he's still here
[1:18:26] alive vindicating his promise the royal
[1:18:29] seat of abraham oh my he will conquer
[1:18:32] the gates of his enemy i mean to those
[1:18:34] seed he stands there alive to vindicate
[1:18:36] himself to who those predestinated seeds
[1:18:39] that can see it
[1:18:41] so he's here to vindicate you who can
[1:18:42] see it who has eyes of understanding in
[1:18:44] this day so he's here to vindicate his

[1:18:49] see it he said in one place the world
[1:18:51] shall not see me but you'll see me that
[1:18:53] means that's how you know you're not of
[1:18:54] the world because you see him in this
[1:18:55] day
[1:18:56] hallelujah
[1:18:58] amen
[1:19:00] hallelujah
[1:19:02] he says this here that they were sealed
[1:19:05] he says he conquered that he says he
[1:19:06] will conquer the gates
[1:19:08] of his enemy to those seed he stands
[1:19:10] here alive to vindicate himself to who
[1:19:12] those predestinated seeds that can see
[1:19:14] it he conquered that who after his test
[1:19:16] of the promise of the word they were
[1:19:18] sealed by the holy ghost into the body
[1:19:20] of christ to them confirmed what hebrews
[1:19:22] 38 to be so they are sealed in there by
[1:19:25] the holy ghost that the holy ghost which
[1:19:28] was by abraham foresaw it by faith he
[1:19:30] believed it and now we receive it
[1:19:32] looking back to the promise of what he
[1:19:34] said and john 14 12 is made confirmed in
[1:19:37] this last days by
[1:19:39] the risen conqueror himself
[1:19:42] hallelujah amen we know john 14 12 he
[1:19:45] that believeth in me the works that i do
[1:19:46] he shall do also and greater than these
[1:19:48] shall you do because i go to my father
[1:19:50] hallelujah
[1:19:52] we're going to lay claim on every
[1:19:53] promise
[1:19:54] you know we may be living in victory but
[1:19:56] that doesn't mean we just we just quit
[1:19:59] we should press in
[1:20:00] we should press in amen amen he says and
[1:20:03] sirs we would see jesus he says
[1:20:06] brother foot footprints is possession
[1:20:09] he says ministering breath and i can say
[1:20:10] this for everyone
[1:20:12] don't be afraid to uh put footprints
[1:20:14] where god has told you to go so if god
[1:20:17] has told you to go buy a stripes i'm
[1:20:19] healed go there claim it he says the
[1:20:21] promise is for you and your children go
[1:20:23] there
[1:20:24] amen if he said that by his stripes i'm
[1:20:26] healed or i'm you know here's your peace
[1:20:29] go there
[1:20:30] whatever promise in the scripture don't
[1:20:32] be afraid to lay claim on it jesus died
[1:20:34] for you to receive it
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:38] it's possession he told joshua
[1:20:40] everywhere the souls of your feet set
[1:20:41] that's yours amen we don't back up we
[1:20:44] take what god said and that's the truth
[1:20:47] no matter what the opposition is
[1:20:49] how great it seems how difficult it
[1:20:52] seems if god said so it's yours that we
[1:20:55] have a real enemy we're fighting
[1:20:57] right he's not just a thought he's not
[1:20:59] just an idea he's a real being right but
[1:21:02] he'll try and bluff you and try and
[1:21:04] intimidate you off your promises off
[1:21:05] your inheritance
[1:21:07] right so but it doesn't matter how big
[1:21:09] the opposition seems he can seem pretty
[1:21:11] big
[1:21:12] right how great it seems how difficult
[1:21:14] it seems i say how impossible it seems
[1:21:16] don't look at those things if god said
[1:21:19] it you say i believe it and i receive it
[1:21:20] and it's mine
[1:21:22] amen you go get it amen he when he gave
[1:21:25] it to joshua he never said i'll take all
[1:21:27] of the philistines and hittites and
[1:21:29] highways out of the land and give it to
[1:21:31] you joshua had to fight for every inch
[1:21:33] of ground but god was with him
[1:21:37] that makes a big difference right there
[1:21:39] amen if god be for me who can be against
[1:21:41] me
[1:21:42] hallelujah and every inch of ground
[1:21:44] you'll cover brother to make footprints
[1:21:46] you'll fight your way through but take
[1:21:48] the sword of the spirit brother and move
[1:21:50] right on foot step footprints is
[1:21:53] possession
[1:21:58] made a transition in his life
[1:22:01] he was born into victory
[1:22:04] because he was a covenant israelite
[1:22:07] circumcised believer living in the
[1:22:08] promised land he can be a lot like a lot
[1:22:12] of message folks today who really know
[1:22:14] god
[1:22:14] they can be living we can be sealed into
[1:22:16] the kingdom by the baptism of the holy
[1:22:18] ghost living in our inheritance walking
[1:22:20] in faith but yet when the enemy comes in
[1:22:23] sometimes we forget who we are
[1:22:26] and shamgar didn't realize who he was
[1:22:28] because he allowed the philistines to
[1:22:30] come in every year and take his crops
[1:22:31] away dr brother brown dramatized it real
[1:22:34] well i mean where god would begin to
[1:22:36] work and your life would come forth in
[1:22:38] his land and you know he about yo he'd
[1:22:40] harvest all the crops and maybe he'd
[1:22:42] think well surely this winter we're
[1:22:43] going to get through
[1:22:45] but then he heard the same old stomp of
[1:22:46] the philistines coming down the road
[1:22:48] fully armed you know it's amazing
[1:22:51] the devil will send 600 soldiers against
[1:22:53] one man
[1:22:55] why because the devil was afraid if
[1:22:57] shamgar only realized who he was
[1:23:00] who he was right there that's why he
[1:23:02] said you think you think maybe one or
[1:23:04] two hey this is a farmer he's gonna why
[1:23:06] why why seen 600. it's because the
[1:23:08] devil's afraid if we really realize who
[1:23:10] we are
[1:23:11] who we are who god has made us already
[1:23:14] because the scripture says now we are
[1:23:16] the sons of god right now we are not one
[1:23:18] day we are right now
[1:23:20] and so the devil was afraid if this man
[1:23:22] really realizes who he is
[1:23:25] amen and shamgar came to a point in his
[1:23:27] life because he saw the need of his
[1:23:28] children he saw his you know maybe is
[1:23:30] the other dress of his daughter all
[1:23:32] ragged and she's all thin and skin and
[1:23:33] bony has looked into his wife's eyes and
[1:23:36] you know maybe he saw only distress and
[1:23:38] pain and worry how are we going to get
[1:23:39] through this year shamga maybe she said
[1:23:41] just with an expression but then he
[1:23:43] began to realize something
[1:23:45] god has made a covenant he made it with
[1:23:48] my forefathers abraham isaac and jacob
[1:23:51] and we could and we would sit around the
[1:23:53] fire we'd tell the stories of joshua and
[1:23:55] what god had done mighty things and and
[1:23:57] you know moses bringing the people out
[1:23:58] and the supernatural done and he began
[1:24:00] to realize i'm of that lineage
[1:24:03] i'm of these people i'm a believer in
[1:24:05] jehovah that same jehovah is alive today
[1:24:08] now he did not have a story of another
[1:24:11] man who took an ox code and killed 600
[1:24:14] enemies but he realized who he was and
[1:24:17] the prophet said when he realized who he
[1:24:19] was that was enough
[1:24:21] hallelujah and notice it doesn't say in
[1:24:23] the scripture that he counted because
[1:24:25] the bible says one will chase a thousand
[1:24:27] he didn't stop there and say now mr
[1:24:28] philistines can you line up i need to
[1:24:30] count you to see if i can win this
[1:24:32] battle no he took his ox code which is
[1:24:34] not a weapon by the way i mean he jumped
[1:24:36] into the middle of the street or the
[1:24:38] road the prophet said and he killed
[1:24:39] every one of those philistines he downed
[1:24:42] everyone because he realized who he was
[1:24:46] so he went from a moment of living in
[1:24:48] defeat but born into victory
[1:24:50] you say well that was a natural lineage
[1:24:53] but this is a faith lineage
[1:24:55] this is a faith lineage i mean god gave
[1:24:57] a promise to the bride
[1:24:59] hallelujah we've received the same holy
[1:25:01] ghost the first amen the alpha bride
[1:25:03] received
[1:25:04] hallelujah and the same god will do the
[1:25:06] same things amen against the same enemy
[1:25:09] in your life
[1:25:11] hallelujah so he realized he was a
[1:25:13] believer
[1:25:14] and he killed every one of those enemies
[1:25:17] hallelujah why because he went from
[1:25:18] actually being born in victory but
[1:25:20] living in defeat
[1:25:22] to actually realizing he was in victory
[1:25:25] and then that victory manifested in
[1:25:27] front of him
[1:25:28] one dead philistine at a time
[1:25:31] could you imagine that feeling of saying
[1:25:33] you know one moment you're all
[1:25:34] distressed within yourself they're going
[1:25:36] to take everything
[1:25:38] how we're going to survive we barely
[1:25:39] survived last winter how's this going to

[1:26:44] says you know what sham god began to
[1:26:46] think you know i'm not a fighter but i'm
[1:26:47] a son of abraham i'm of the tribe in the

[1:26:59] now that's a stick with a little knob on
[1:27:01] it where they could punch the ox and
[1:27:03] make him plow and he jumped out there
[1:27:04] with this ox goat in his hand and beat
[1:27:06] down 600 philistines why because he
[1:27:08] knowed he was an israelite he had a
[1:27:10] right he had a right to god given rights
[1:27:13] he was circumcised we are circumcised
[1:27:16] today by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:18] we have god-given rights i mean when the
[1:27:20] enemy comes along you know we could have
[1:27:22] an amazing media incredible camp then
[1:27:24] the philistines will come along try and
[1:27:25] steal your joy steal your victory but
[1:27:28] you have a right to actually say devil

[1:27:56] he didn't know how to fight you say i
[1:27:58] don't know nothing about faith step out
[1:28:00] anyhow
[1:28:01] he never seen it done before but he
[1:28:03] stepped out anyhow based on who he was
[1:28:06] amen that's why you've got to step out
[1:28:07] of faith take god's word step out in
[1:28:09] faith anyhow
[1:28:11] hallelujah
[1:28:13] amen i love the story of arnold von
[1:28:15] winkler of switzerland
[1:28:17] i love this story
[1:28:19] there came a point where the austrians
[1:28:20] had come in and the swiss decided
[1:28:22] they're going to fight
[1:28:24] and arnold von winkler the you know the
[1:28:26] story goes because the swiss weren't
[1:28:29] fighters they weren't for i mean they
[1:28:30] weren't professional soldiers are just
[1:28:31] farmers
[1:28:32] and they had their you know they had
[1:28:34] their size and their axes in their
[1:28:36] whatever they had whatever implements
[1:28:37] they had and they gathered together and
[1:28:39] they were facing a far greater force in
[1:28:42] themselves these were trained men you
[1:28:45] know they were fighting a trained
[1:28:46] military against rather but then there
[1:28:48] was a man who stepped forth arnold von
[1:28:50] winkler and he said swiss brethren
[1:28:53] this day i'll give my life to
[1:28:54] switzerland for the homeland he says
[1:28:56] what will you do the you know the people
[1:28:58] responded he said down in the valley
[1:29:00] yonder

[1:29:03] and little children are waiting for me
[1:29:05] to come back but they'll never see me
[1:29:07] again for this day i shall give my life

[1:29:12] you know jesus says i sanctify myself as
[1:29:14] in john for for for the disciples sake
[1:29:18] he chose to live a sanctified life
[1:29:21] there's a lot of things he could have
[1:29:22] done but he decided just to let those
[1:29:24] things go and be sanctified to god for
[1:29:27] the disciples sake
[1:29:29] what if we had that in our hearts
[1:29:32] that we let selfishness go what we
[1:29:34] wanted to go we sanctify ourselves for
[1:29:37] each other's sake
[1:29:40] amen
[1:29:41] i sanctify myself father for my family's
[1:29:44] sake for my children's sake for my
[1:29:46] brother's sake for my sister's sake for
[1:29:49] the old one's sake for the young
[1:29:50] people's sake for the marriage sake for
[1:29:52] the single sake i for my way with love
[1:29:55] once sake lord i sanctify myself to your
[1:29:58] service you know there is nothing and
[1:30:00] all things are possible to them that
[1:30:01] believe
[1:30:02] brotherham said this untapped resources
[1:30:04] in god untapped there's actually parts
[1:30:06] of god that have not been tapped into i
[1:30:09] believe being stored up for this season
[1:30:11] i mean your prayer is unlimited
[1:30:14] you know if god you know if we really if
[1:30:16] we really could just it would anchor in
[1:30:18] our hearts the power of prayer
[1:30:20] i mean the prayer of a righteous man
[1:30:22] availeth much
[1:30:24] hallelujah where the whole world's
[1:30:26] course can be changed because of your
[1:30:27] prayer
[1:30:29] you say well that's too well but this
[1:30:30] prophecy is going to be fulfilled yeah
[1:30:32] but you could change someone's life
[1:30:34] the eternal destination of someone could
[1:30:36] be changed because of your prayer
[1:30:40] prayer is not let's not limit god
[1:30:45] amen prayer is powerful prayer moves
[1:30:48] things prayer changes things the prophet
[1:30:51] said it'll move kingdoms
[1:30:53] it'll change the economics of the world
[1:30:55] holy it causes people to move from one
[1:30:57] place to another place from one side of
[1:30:58] the world to another part of the world
[1:31:00] hallelujah you know christine when we
[1:31:03] first started church here i'm going to
[1:31:04] pray for south africans i want south
[1:31:06] africans in church
[1:31:08] and he caused people to move from one
[1:31:09] part of the earth to the other part of
[1:31:10] the earth
[1:31:11] hallelujah to come here
[1:31:14] you think you think that didn't cause
[1:31:15] people to move
[1:31:17] how are we people who have moved
[1:31:19] hallelujah
[1:31:20] hallelujah
[1:31:22] and they just thought well maybe it's a
[1:31:23] good idea so no god was moving because
[1:31:25] of prayer
[1:31:27] amen i don't think that's too
[1:31:29] far-fetched you know god can do anything
[1:31:31] he wants to
[1:31:32] but let him pray it through you look
[1:31:34] he's looking remember he is the vine but
[1:31:36] we are the branches the branches bear
[1:31:38] the fruit
[1:31:39] the vine cannot bear fruit it cannot
[1:31:41] manifest its own life within itself it
[1:31:44] needs a branch to manifest its life
[1:31:46] within it right that's why i said lord
[1:31:49] i'm a branch
[1:31:50] manifest your glory through me
[1:31:53] even if even if you know because the
[1:31:55] greatest prayers are once told in secret
[1:31:58] and you know you could be a mighty
[1:31:59] prayer warrior great things are moving
[1:32:01] the reason the church is a success
[1:32:03] because of your prayers we say nothing
[1:32:04] about it but then on the other side when
[1:32:06] the testimony roll is opened up
[1:32:08] holy see the power of the prayers amen
[1:32:11] of the saints
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:14] amen prayer is very powerful
[1:32:17] if you want to get a burden for prayer
[1:32:18] there's a booklet out there saying a
[1:32:20] call for prayer
[1:32:21] it's made by um
[1:32:23] brother harold beckett it's just all
[1:32:24] quotes of the prophet about prayer
[1:32:26] that's very powerful
[1:32:28] amen now
[1:32:30] he says this
[1:32:32] okay every one of you
[1:32:34] um
[1:32:35] he says now what will you do they asked
[1:32:37] arnold von winkler he said now every one
[1:32:39] of you that's got weapons come follow me
[1:32:41] and do the best you can fight with what
[1:32:44] you've got do everything you can with
[1:32:46] what you've got to do with
[1:32:49] see sometimes we think we need a great
[1:32:50] big super weapon but fight with what you
[1:32:52] got
[1:32:53] i've just got a little bit of faith i'm
[1:32:54] weak in faith fight with that faith
[1:32:57] fight with what you've got amen
[1:33:00] and he screamed he threw up his weapon
[1:33:02] said make way for liberty and he started
[1:33:05] towards that army he went right towards
[1:33:07] the thickest of the spares and when he
[1:33:08] got he he got right down to where they
[1:33:11] was a hundred gleaming spears to catch
[1:33:12] him as he come he threw up his hands
[1:33:14] he'd make way for liberty he grabbed big
[1:33:16] armfuls of those spears and threw them
[1:33:18] into his chest and each one of those
[1:33:20] swiss soldiers followed behind him he
[1:33:22] broke the ranks of the enemy and they
[1:33:23] won a victory like has never been won
[1:33:25] before
[1:33:26] and today you can mention his name in
[1:33:28] switzerland and their eyes will color
[1:33:30] with tears and their cheeks will flush
[1:33:32] for their hero that was one of the
[1:33:33] greatest heroes to my opinion that's
[1:33:35] been an army life but it's just a minor
[1:33:38] thing
[1:33:39] just a minor thing one day the sons of
[1:33:42] adam were standing defeated law prophets
[1:33:44] and everything had failed every approach
[1:33:46] they had made had totally failed and
[1:33:48] yonder in glory there was one stepped
[1:33:50] out called the son of god and the angel
[1:33:52] said what will you do he said i'll go
[1:33:54] down and give my life and this day i'll
[1:33:57] redeem the fallen sons of adam and he
[1:33:59] came to calvary he went to the thickest
[1:34:01] of the spares he went through the valley
[1:34:03] of the shadow of death and caught every
[1:34:04] dart of the devil and pulled it into his
[1:34:06] own bosom and called for the church to
[1:34:09] to take what they've got and do the best
[1:34:11] you can
[1:34:13] praise god on the day of pentecost a
[1:34:15] russian mighty one fell out of the
[1:34:16] heavens above and armed every man with a
[1:34:19] weapon
[1:34:20] amen if you've got the baptism of the
[1:34:22] holy ghost fight with what you got
[1:34:24] hallelujah and today brethren that every
[1:34:28] man whatever you've got let's do the
[1:34:29] best we can with what we got and fight
[1:34:31] to the last man because the enemy lines
[1:34:34] broke amen christ defeated satan
[1:34:37] stripped him of everything he ever had
[1:34:39] and he's nothing today but a bluff when
[1:34:41] he tells you you can't have another
[1:34:43] old-fashioned holy ghost outpouring of
[1:34:45] the spirit we can have it today because
[1:34:47] the lions of the enemy is broke and god
[1:34:49] rules and reigns today
[1:34:51] hallelujah the lines of the enemy is
[1:34:53] still broke when he says you can't have
[1:34:55] joy the lion's enemy is broke just run
[1:34:57] through where the lion's been broken
[1:34:58] holly you can't have the holy ghost
[1:35:00] today yes you can i mean run through
[1:35:02] where the lines are being broken you
[1:35:03] can't have healing yes you can run
[1:35:06] through where the lines have been broken
[1:35:07] you can't have salvation yes you can run
[1:35:10] through where the enemies lines have
[1:35:11] been broken because god is still alive
[1:35:13] today
[1:35:14] he still rules and reigns today amen
[1:35:17] those lines have been broken fight with
[1:35:19] what you've got
[1:35:20] oh my faith is small don't worry about
[1:35:22] what you think about your faith i mean
[1:35:24] you put it to action and see what
[1:35:26] see how many devils are on the run
[1:35:28] because of the faith you already have
[1:35:31] hallelujah i need more faith just ask
[1:35:33] god but fight with what you've got amen
[1:35:36] amen why because we're living in victory
[1:35:38] we are standing the bride
[1:35:41] 2021 is victorious
[1:35:43] we're in a victorious condition
[1:35:46] amen he says hallelujah i'm glad for an
[1:35:48] old-fashioned holy ghost experience of
[1:35:49] the living god
[1:35:51] hallelujah
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] now we read there about in john
[1:35:58] where our faith
[1:36:00] overcometh the world
[1:36:02] that's the victory we have now to have
[1:36:04] victory means you've won
[1:36:06] right victory never means defeat it
[1:36:07] means you've won
[1:36:09] you have fought a battle and one
[1:36:11] hallelujah
[1:36:13] but the thing is today is people will
[1:36:15] take
[1:36:16] the scripture
[1:36:17] and they'll look at the season we're in
[1:36:18] and say well
[1:36:20] but we're in a different season
[1:36:21] but the word applies for today just as
[1:36:24] it's just as alive and fresh as when it
[1:36:26] was first pinned down
[1:36:28] or first spoken yes amen
[1:36:31] and brother man says and faith is our
[1:36:32] victory
[1:36:34] so
[1:36:35] let's just let's just settle this
[1:36:36] through if you who's got revelation
[1:36:38] not human faith
[1:36:40] but god has had has given you the
[1:36:42] revelation of who he is
[1:36:44] right you've got revelation faith
[1:36:46] that is the victory that overcometh the
[1:36:48] world
[1:36:49] so we are not like one day we will be
[1:36:52] like those on the sea of glass praising
[1:36:54] god because we've gotten the victory
[1:36:56] but we can have that same victory
[1:36:58] dance
[1:36:59] right now
[1:37:01] because the faith we have received
[1:37:04] overcomes the world we're living in
[1:37:07] it overcomes it doesn't matter how big
[1:37:09] the enemy is the faith the revelation in
[1:37:11] you overcomes it
[1:37:15] you say john when he wrote that he
[1:37:16] didn't have my troubles he did not have
[1:37:19] to deal with the folk that i deal with
[1:37:21] he did not have to go through the things
[1:37:23] that i do that's right
[1:37:26] he may not had to deal with the same
[1:37:28] folk he may not had to have overcome the
[1:37:30] same thing but he never excluded them
[1:37:33] for he said this the faith is the
[1:37:36] victory that overcomes the world
[1:37:38] the whole thing
[1:37:41] how is it get faith in it right above it
[1:37:44] when we have the written word of god
[1:37:45] lying before us
[1:37:47] and the holy spirit here performing and
[1:37:49] showing the resurrection of the lord
[1:37:51] jesus with the divine promises written
[1:37:53] here that whatever thing you desire when
[1:37:55] you pray believe you receive it and you
[1:37:57] shall have it what do we have to do then
[1:38:00] have faith not just floating faith not a
[1:38:03] make-believe faith but a real faith
[1:38:07] floating faith has no place it anchors
[1:38:09] on
[1:38:09] oh that's a good idea i think that's a
[1:38:11] nice thing that's floating faith or a
[1:38:13] make-believe faith is a mental faith but
[1:38:15] a real faith is a revelation
[1:38:18] you know it so
[1:38:19] you're not it's not i hope it is you
[1:38:21] know it
[1:38:24] now faith is a conqueror faith is an
[1:38:26] overcomer
[1:38:27] it isn't
[1:38:28] it just isn't a peacemaker
[1:38:31] so there's nothing in faith that makes
[1:38:32] peace with the devil
[1:38:34] he's not built g our god is a god of war
[1:38:38] he's a god of peace but he's a god of
[1:38:40] war and he's a mighty man of war haven't
[1:38:42] you ever watched the devil come against
[1:38:44] one of god's children that devil's got
[1:38:46] to contend with jesus christ our lord
[1:38:49] hallelujah
[1:38:50] amen it's just not in god to make peace
[1:38:52] with the devil
[1:38:54] so why would we make peace with him
[1:38:56] it overcomes faith is the victory that
[1:38:59] overcomes the world what does it do what
[1:39:01] is faith what is to conquer conquer and
[1:39:04] victory is the same to conquer it means
[1:39:05] to beat down to override to handcuff to
[1:39:08] throw into prison it means that the sin
[1:39:10] that once ruled you you rule it now why
[1:39:13] because you realize you're in victory
[1:39:14] above it
[1:39:16] i mean it means that you have to
[1:39:17] overcome it you are you've whipped it
[1:39:20] you're greater than it is oh i feel
[1:39:22] religious right now
[1:39:23] what was first a sinner or a savior a
[1:39:26] savior for a savior is more powerful
[1:39:28] than a sin
[1:39:29] what was first the healer of sickness
[1:39:33] see
[1:39:34] it couldn't be a healer at least he was
[1:39:36] over the sickness it is the healer that
[1:39:38] conquers the sickness
[1:39:40] amen and faith is the victory that
[1:39:42] overcomes every curse of the devil faith
[1:39:44] is a victory faith in what not faith in
[1:39:46] your church not faith in your creed not
[1:39:49] faith in some man but faith in jesus
[1:39:51] christ who made the promise that's the
[1:39:53] victory what is it it's the victory say
[1:39:55] my arm is still crippled but faith is
[1:39:57] the victory i still feel sick but faith
[1:40:00] is a victory oh it overcomes the world
[1:40:04] hallelujah
[1:40:06] so you can be in the middle of the
[1:40:07] greatest battle but you'll realize no
[1:40:09] the faith in me is going to has already
[1:40:11] overcome this
[1:40:12] amen this enemy though he fights me is
[1:40:14] going to be defeated
[1:40:16] hallelujah your brother makes a
[1:40:19] statement in the church book it is
[1:40:21] he says it is revelation
[1:40:24] it is the revelation of god that will
[1:40:26] give you authority over the devil
[1:40:29] so when you realize when god reveals you
[1:40:31] that you are his son or daughter that
[1:40:33] gives you authority over the devil
[1:40:35] remember the devil wasn't as a fallen
[1:40:38] angel and angels are servants they are
[1:40:40] never they are never the family of god
[1:40:43] so they're always lower than the family
[1:40:45] of god
[1:40:46] now so so the devil being an angel
[1:40:48] that's fallen that means he got fired
[1:40:50] from his job
[1:40:52] right so now he's a fired servant who
[1:40:55] tries to think make you think he's
[1:40:57] greater than you but he's actually out
[1:40:59] of the economy of god he's not even part
[1:41:00] of the kingdom of god he's been kicked
[1:41:02] out he's been fired right so why would
[1:41:05] we let a fired servant
[1:41:07] try and have rulership over us
[1:41:10] we've got to realize that we have
[1:41:12] authority over the devil
[1:41:16] and you can see why they who add or take
[1:41:19] away from it will be cursed that's the
[1:41:21] book of revelation it would have to be
[1:41:23] so for who can add or take away
[1:41:25] from the perfect revelation of god and
[1:41:28] overcome the enemy it's that simple
[1:41:30] there is nothing as such prevailing
[1:41:32] power as the revelation of the word
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:38] hallelujah
[1:41:39] now webster will tell us that prevailing
[1:41:42] means to defeat an opponent especially
[1:41:45] in a long or difficult contest
[1:41:48] now
[1:41:49] this in in in in human
[1:41:52] years
[1:41:53] the christian life can be a long and
[1:41:54] difficult contest because the devil's
[1:41:56] fighting us every day
[1:41:58] right but if we have the revelation of
[1:42:01] the word of who jesus christ is who we
[1:42:03] are in him then we have prevailing
[1:42:06] revelation
[1:42:07] and that prevailing revelation will
[1:42:09] cause us to conquer every enemy that
[1:42:11] comes against us because there's nothing
[1:42:13] as such prevailing power as the
[1:42:15] revelation of the word so the devil will
[1:42:17] try and prevail against you but he will
[1:42:19] end up defeated right and you'll prevail
[1:42:22] over him and you'll walk out packing the
[1:42:24] victory why because we're already in a
[1:42:26] victorious condition
[1:42:28] imagine going into a contest knowing
[1:42:30] you're going to win
[1:42:31] imagine that
[1:42:33] but then really the only challenge would
[1:42:34] be what what kind of margin can i win by
[1:42:37] do i want to win by one point we'll just
[1:42:39] take a game for example you know there's
[1:42:41] some you know
[1:42:43] like like in rugby or the sevens you
[1:42:44] know there's some team will face a team
[1:42:47] that's they don't even know why they're
[1:42:48] there like the all blacks will play i
[1:42:50] don't know who's not very good these
[1:42:51] days but or whoever's good or bad you
[1:42:53] know but there's such a margin of skill
[1:42:55] between the two teams now the one who's
[1:42:58] who's way better knows it's going to win
[1:43:00] it can't lose
[1:43:02] but then the challenge is how much can
[1:43:04] we win by
[1:43:05] why not go for a record
[1:43:07] why not because we're going to win we
[1:43:09] can't lose this thing
[1:43:10] these guys don't have the skill now if
[1:43:13] you take that and you take it into the
[1:43:14] spiritual realm and now our opponent is
[1:43:17] already defeated
[1:43:18] he's been stripped of all power
[1:43:20] right he's nothing but a bluff we are
[1:43:22] already victorious because the lord has
[1:43:24] made us victorious right well how much
[1:43:27] can we win by now
[1:43:29] do you want to have a close run thing
[1:43:30] where we just kind of we're going to win
[1:43:32] but you just want to win by one point
[1:43:34] but it wouldn't buy a thousand you want
[1:43:36] to hit a record or you know just have a
[1:43:38] mediocre time on the field no i think i
[1:43:40] think we should go for a record
[1:43:43] because christ has given us the victory
[1:43:45] so why not go for a record against the
[1:43:47] devil like no other believers have had
[1:43:49] in the history of the world
[1:43:53] amen because remember the lord has given
[1:43:54] us all things
[1:43:56] amen so why not press the battle until
[1:43:58] we receive all things
[1:44:01] you may think that's a bit of a crude
[1:44:03] illustration using a game but it is like
[1:44:04] that we've won if you've had your
[1:44:06] victory day
[1:44:07] and you've surrendered your whole life
[1:44:09] to the lord and he's the king of your
[1:44:11] life amen you know your sins are all
[1:44:13] washed away he sealed you into the
[1:44:14] kingdom by the holy ghost you've won
[1:44:16] you've won the game of life i think
[1:44:18] brother isaac is saying yo you've won
[1:44:19] the game of life
[1:44:21] but now how much do you want to win bye
[1:44:24] we have one life to live one life to
[1:44:27] give let's go for the top score
[1:44:30] hallelujah
[1:44:31] hey this is the final round we might as
[1:44:32] well knock out the devil
[1:44:34] we might as well just do a victory lap
[1:44:36] while we do it oh yeah not in some
[1:44:38] arrogant way no christians humble
[1:44:40] because it's our god that fights the
[1:44:42] battle if you know it's him fighting
[1:44:44] your battle you'll never be arrogant
[1:44:46] but if you think it's you and all you
[1:44:47] what you are you're well that's
[1:44:49] arrogancy but if you know it's god
[1:44:51] fighting the battle amen you'll always
[1:44:53] be humble because you know the prophet
[1:44:55] even said i don't want the lord to lift
[1:44:57] his hand off me just for a minute
[1:45:00] and uh
[1:45:01] i want to be the same way lord keep your
[1:45:03] hand on me
[1:45:04] may there be no way the devil can get
[1:45:06] into my life because i can't beat him i
[1:45:08] mean i need you in my life to beat him
[1:45:12] hallelujah no
[1:45:16] satan as i said in the beginning is more
[1:45:18] than a match the prophet said there's a
[1:45:20] contest between god and satan he says
[1:45:22] satan is more than a match for us we
[1:45:23] know that we know satan is way more of a
[1:45:26] match for any human being don't ever try
[1:45:28] and do it with your wisdom and outsmart
[1:45:31] him you can't do it
[1:45:32] jesus knew this
[1:45:34] pardon me so he said to the church so
[1:45:36] satan
[1:45:37] could not outsmart them a place to be
[1:45:39] fortified he sent them the holy ghost
[1:45:42] and the church does not claim to be
[1:45:44] smart they just claim to believe
[1:45:47] hallelujah
[1:45:49] now faith as i s um from that previous
[1:45:52] quote i was going to read a bit then
[1:45:53] we'll go but
[1:45:54] faith can't just be floating faith or
[1:45:57] make-believe faith it's got to be real
[1:45:58] faith
[1:45:59] now our faith
[1:46:01] cannot rest upon nothing
[1:46:04] i mean yet now our faith cannot rest
[1:46:06] upon nothing a christian has to have
[1:46:08] faith his faith has to have a solid
[1:46:10] resting place you know that and the only
[1:46:12] resting place that a christian a true
[1:46:14] born again christian can rest his faith
[1:46:16] or hers is upon the unmovable word of
[1:46:19] god
[1:46:20] it isn't built upon the shifting sands
[1:46:22] of man's theology and doctrines and upon
[1:46:25] some church affiliation but a true
[1:46:27] believer his faith arrests solidly
[1:46:30] unshifting as he approaches the word of
[1:46:33] god i was saying something somewhere
[1:46:35] maybe a few nights ago i wanted to
[1:46:37] preach so bad i preached to my wife in
[1:46:40] bed till about 12 o'clock just telling
[1:46:42] you how glorious jesus was a text came
[1:46:45] on my heart it kept burning in me so
[1:46:46] great till i couldn't rest with it i
[1:46:48] said honey i want to preach you a little
[1:46:50] while and she roused up by grace you
[1:46:52] listen i said the christian faith
[1:46:55] is solidly is based solely upon rest
[1:46:59] that's right a christian is not tossed
[1:47:01] about a christian doesn't run from place
[1:47:03] to place a christian doesn't fuss and
[1:47:06] fume and worry about things a christian
[1:47:08] rests it's all over it's all finished
[1:47:11] for the believer at calvary that's right
[1:47:13] oh sickness may come and disappointments
[1:47:16] but the christian is at rest knowing
[1:47:18] this that god is able to keep that which
[1:47:21] he has performed
[1:47:22] knowing that no matter what the thing is
[1:47:25] and how it looks and there is neither
[1:47:27] sickness sorrow death there is neither
[1:47:30] starvation or anything that can separate
[1:47:32] us from the love of god that's in christ
[1:47:34] jesus we're at rest just let the old
[1:47:37] chip toss any way she wants to the
[1:47:39] anchor holds
[1:47:42] so the believer's life is based upon
[1:47:44] being in rest
[1:47:46] well how can you be in battle and be in
[1:47:48] rest at the same time easy you're
[1:47:51] resting because god is living through
[1:47:52] you fighting the battle
[1:47:54] but you're fighting the battle because
[1:47:55] you've got a devil that you want to
[1:47:57] defeat
[1:47:58] but you're resting you're not worried is
[1:48:00] this going to work is my faith going to
[1:48:02] hold out of course it will the faith
[1:48:04] that was in him is in you
[1:48:06] paul said the life i now live in the
[1:48:07] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:48:09] god
[1:48:10] his faith
[1:48:11] cast out the devils out of legion
[1:48:13] his faith calmed the storm his faith
[1:48:16] brought lazarus from the grave his faith
[1:48:18] raised a dead boy who has been taken
[1:48:20] from burial his faith raised dries his
[1:48:22] daughter his faith amen fed the
[1:48:24] multitudes amen his faith took him to
[1:48:27] calvary his faith amen took him out of
[1:48:30] the grave
[1:48:31] because he says no man takes my life
[1:48:33] from me i lay it down i'll raise her
[1:48:35] back up again now that same faith is in
[1:48:37] you so if his faith held out
[1:48:41] and that faith is in you and i
[1:48:43] it'll hold
[1:48:44] see it's not whether we hold on to god
[1:48:46] or not it's whether he holds on to us
[1:48:49] hallelujah
[1:48:51] so how our christian experience should
[1:48:53] be based solely upon rest
[1:48:56] now the apostle paul would speak in
[1:48:58] hebrew as you say speaking hebrews 3 and
[1:49:00] 4 paralleling the journey of of of
[1:49:03] israel from egypt to the promised land
[1:49:05] he parallels it with the christian
[1:49:06] journey
[1:49:07] he says in in hebrews 4 verse 3 for we
[1:49:11] which have believed to enter into rest
[1:49:14] as he said as i've sworn on my wrath if
[1:49:16] they shall enter into my rest although
[1:49:18] the works are finished from the
[1:49:19] foundation of the world for he spake at
[1:49:21] a certain place of the seventh day on
[1:49:23] this wise and god did rest the sabbath
[1:49:26] um god did rest the seventh day from all
[1:49:29] of his works and in this place again
[1:49:32] if they shall enter into my arrest he
[1:49:34] says seeing therefore
[1:49:35] it remaineth that some of us
[1:49:38] must enter therein and they to whom it
[1:49:41] was first preached entered not in
[1:49:42] because of unbelief
[1:49:44] again you i've got to put the scripture
[1:49:46] up
[1:49:48] so so we're in hebrews uh four
[1:49:50] i'm just finding a place you get a drink
[1:49:51] too
[1:49:53] but it's good if you can see it i think
[1:49:57] because really the condition of your
[1:49:58] life if everything troubles you so much
[1:50:00] are you in rest
[1:50:02] if you try and take care of the
[1:50:03] situation yourself are you in rest
[1:50:06] i've got to talk to this one about this
[1:50:08] and this and to maneuver this and
[1:50:09] political things and this and talk to
[1:50:11] this person gain advantage over this and
[1:50:13] fix this no is that rest
[1:50:15] no that's human manipulation that's not
[1:50:17] rest
[1:50:18] amen if we worry and fret so sure we
[1:50:20] should be burdened there's a difference
[1:50:22] between worrying and being burdened
[1:50:24] right because a burden worry is just
[1:50:26] human emotion and the devil's
[1:50:27] distracting you with worry and fear but
[1:50:29] a burden is god is going to do something
[1:50:31] and you express that burden in prayer
[1:50:34] right now where are we in verse seven
[1:50:35] here we are again he limiteth a certain
[1:50:38] day saying in david today after so long
[1:50:40] a time as it is said today if you will
[1:50:42] hear his voice heart and not your hearts
[1:50:44] for if jesus had given them rest then
[1:50:46] would he not afterwards have spoken of
[1:50:48] another day there remaineth therefore
[1:50:51] rest to the people of god for he that
[1:50:53] enters into his rest
[1:50:56] he also has ceased from his own works as
[1:50:59] god did from his
[1:51:01] so what does that mean it's not you
[1:51:02] trying to be the christian anymore it's
[1:51:04] him in you so you so you have ceased
[1:51:07] from your own works trying to please god
[1:51:09] your own self and now it's he living
[1:51:11] through you doing the works
[1:51:13] amen let us labor therefore to enter
[1:51:15] into that restless any man fall after
[1:51:18] the same example of unbelief now the
[1:51:21] rest we're talking about here is the
[1:51:23] true rest which is the baptism of the
[1:51:24] holy ghost right so i said if you've had
[1:51:26] your victory day and god's met you
[1:51:28] you've entered into rest
[1:51:30] you've won
[1:51:31] right
[1:51:33] he was saying gee um jesus was saying
[1:51:35] matthew 11 28 come unto me all you that
[1:51:38] labor in a heavy laden and i will give
[1:51:40] you rest
[1:51:42] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:51:44] for i meek and lonely in heart and you
[1:51:47] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[1:51:49] yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:51:53] isaiah would prophesy this rest coming
[1:51:56] in isaiah 28 and 11 time
[1:51:58] things are quick here he says for with
[1:52:00] stammering lips and another tongue he
[1:52:02] will speak to this people
[1:52:05] to whom he said this is the rest
[1:52:07] wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest
[1:52:10] and this is the refreshing yet they
[1:52:12] would not hear she says with stammering
[1:52:14] lips another time will he speak to this
[1:52:16] people on the day of pentecost when the
[1:52:18] day of pentecost fully come they're
[1:52:20] filled with the holy ghost what happened
[1:52:21] 120 people entered into rest
[1:52:24] and they walked out praising god
[1:52:26] staggering jabbering stammering
[1:52:28] the people thought they were drunk with
[1:52:30] new wine
[1:52:31] but what had happened is they had
[1:52:33] entered into rest
[1:52:35] they had entered into a true rest we
[1:52:37] know the sabbath day of of of keeping a
[1:52:40] day of the week that was just a shadow
[1:52:42] pointing to a reality because remember
[1:52:44] our rest is not if we keep a day
[1:52:47] no our rest the true sabbath is
[1:52:50] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:52] you enter into rest
[1:52:54] he was saying colossians 2 and 16 let no
[1:52:57] man therefore judge you in meter and
[1:52:59] drink or respect of a holy day or of the
[1:53:01] new moon of the sabbath days which are a
[1:53:04] shadow of things to come but the body is
[1:53:06] of christ so those things are just
[1:53:08] shadows the reality is you really meet
[1:53:10] the lord amen what's happened you are
[1:53:13] now living in the sabbath
[1:53:15] every day
[1:53:16] your soul is in a sabbath condition in a
[1:53:18] rest
[1:53:19] amen and if you're in a if you've
[1:53:21] entered into that rest you're living in
[1:53:23] victory
[1:53:25] i hope you're not being wary about this
[1:53:26] let's just let's just wind this up he
[1:53:28] says in broken systems i've got a few
[1:53:30] more things to read in broken systems
[1:53:32] brother um says that the believer the
[1:53:35] inexhaustible fountain of life is jesus
[1:53:37] christ why and who is he the word the
[1:53:40] same the word the life the fountain the
[1:53:42] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:53:43] true believer it's his supreme joy
[1:53:46] his supreme life and his supreme
[1:53:48] satisfaction is in christ
[1:53:50] no pumping no pulling no joining no
[1:53:54] bailing just believing and resting
[1:53:57] that's what
[1:53:58] he is to the believing
[1:54:01] amen you're just believing and resting
[1:54:03] why is that because you're in rest
[1:54:05] because you know god is fighting your
[1:54:06] battles you have ceased from your own
[1:54:08] works and god is doing the works through
[1:54:10] you
[1:54:10] hallelujah there's a victorious life
[1:54:14] brother brown would say in the token
[1:54:16] paul said the life i now live this is
[1:54:18] from galatians 2 20 he's referring to he
[1:54:20] lived a different life from what he once
[1:54:22] did is not me but christ liveth in me
[1:54:25] that is the identified token that god
[1:54:28] required now the token is the holy ghost
[1:54:30] okay
[1:54:31] identification with our sacrifice the
[1:54:33] life of our savior in us the holy spirit
[1:54:36] he says oh what a positive token there
[1:54:39] cannot be any more token oh my if you
[1:54:41] could only catch the thought of it if i
[1:54:43] had power this morning with words to
[1:54:45] express and place into your souls not
[1:54:48] your ears but your soul the guarantee of
[1:54:50] it it makes you so relaxed
[1:54:54] if we and now he doesn't say get lax and
[1:54:57] loose but it makes you so relaxed why
[1:55:00] because you're on your way to heaven
[1:55:01] shouting victory your eternal
[1:55:04] destination has been secured
[1:55:06] amen you know where you're going
[1:55:08] you're not wondering if you're going to
[1:55:10] make it you've already made it
[1:55:12] hallelujah you've just got to catch up
[1:55:13] to where you're going to be
[1:55:15] amen why because our souls are sealed by
[1:55:17] the baptism of the holy ghost and to the
[1:55:19] day of our redemption
[1:55:20] amen so because of this
[1:55:23] it doesn't matter
[1:55:24] now what the world
[1:55:27] throws at you
[1:55:29] why because the revelation you have
[1:55:30] received overcomes the world
[1:55:33] it overcomes the faith you now have it
[1:55:35] overcomes every evil spirit
[1:55:37] whatever the enemy throws at you
[1:55:39] sickness the faith within you overcomes
[1:55:41] ladies and everything in it amen
[1:55:44] hallelujah
[1:55:46] now
[1:55:47] brother graham says here in in the
[1:55:48] summer and church age he says now be
[1:55:51] thou faithful unto death now wait i'll
[1:55:53] just stop here people diminish the faith
[1:55:55] they have
[1:55:57] they think well i just you know what
[1:55:59] does it mean to be you know and and the
[1:56:01] world has certainly diminished believing
[1:56:04] you know because everyone's name it and
[1:56:05] claim it and all these you know i
[1:56:07] believe but there's no change in the
[1:56:08] life and don't let those things diminish
[1:56:10] real faith
[1:56:14] people say well i just you know i'm just
[1:56:15] living my life and i'm just continuing
[1:56:17] on nothing seems to be happening no
[1:56:19] there's a faith at work
[1:56:21] if you've met the lord there's a faith
[1:56:23] at work
[1:56:24] he says be thou faithful unto death now
[1:56:26] this is from the sumerian church age he
[1:56:28] does not say be faithful until death but
[1:56:30] unto death you may have to seal your
[1:56:32] testimony with your blood
[1:56:34] thousands yeah millions have died during
[1:56:36] all the ages they died in the faith like
[1:56:39] antipas the faithful martyr they held
[1:56:41] not their lives dear unto death often we
[1:56:44] think that it would be almost impossible
[1:56:46] to be a martyr
[1:56:48] but dare to recall
[1:56:49] that the faith we daily use to triumph
[1:56:52] in christ jesus is the same faith that
[1:56:56] upholds the polycarbs and all the
[1:56:57] martyrs the supreme faith will give
[1:57:00] supreme grace for the supreme hour
[1:57:03] blessed be god forever amen to the same
[1:57:06] faith they had to go to the lion's den
[1:57:09] go to the colosseum and you'll be be
[1:57:11] torn to pieces or or torture whatever
[1:57:13] that same faith we have
[1:57:16] to overcome every day amen amen he says
[1:57:19] the supreme faith will give supreme
[1:57:20] grace for the supreme hour you know we
[1:57:23] think often how on earth is this rapture
[1:57:24] really going to take place how's this
[1:57:26] body going to be changed the faith
[1:57:27] within you is going to change the body
[1:57:29] amen and why it's supreme grace i mean
[1:57:32] the supreme faith will give supreme
[1:57:33] grace for the supreme hour because when
[1:57:35] you read through the scripture when the
[1:57:37] enemy comes in like a flood god raises
[1:57:39] the standard
[1:57:40] hallelujah and before any of those
[1:57:42] instances maybe the people would think
[1:57:43] how on earth is this going to happen
[1:57:46] you know you think moses he's been he's
[1:57:48] been anointed by god to go get israel
[1:57:50] out of egypt but then yeah he said how's
[1:57:53] this going to happen well god told me so
[1:57:54] i'm going there's been no record of red
[1:57:56] seas parting your rivers turning to
[1:57:58] blood your darkness and the death angel
[1:58:00] there's nothing of those happen but
[1:58:02] whenever the enemy came against that
[1:58:04] word that was going to be fulfilled god
[1:58:06] anointed moses to overcome so he gave
[1:58:09] god gave us a uh god gave a supreme
[1:58:13] grace for a supreme hour
[1:58:15] joshua going around jericho no record of
[1:58:17] it ever happening before but when the
[1:58:19] enemy sealed up the city like that god
[1:58:21] gave a supreme grace for that supreme
[1:58:23] hour
[1:58:24] and you take that all the way through
[1:58:25] the scriptures and now in this end time
[1:58:27] where the world is so dark and fallen
[1:58:29] apart god will give a supreme grace for
[1:58:32] this supreme hour amen hallelujah so we
[1:58:34] can rest on that knowing that god has
[1:58:37] our lives in his hands
[1:58:39] hallelujah
[1:58:40] amen
[1:58:44] amen now i'll just finish with the
[1:58:46] we have authority by god's word to get
[1:58:48] angry with the devil
[1:58:50] god gives us a victory we got it now
[1:58:52] this is the victory that overcomes the
[1:58:53] world even your faith
[1:58:56] now
[1:58:58] i'm going to read this and i'm done
[1:59:01] what is it not them people the headship
[1:59:03] in the body has become one unit it's god
[1:59:05] manifested in his people that's the
[1:59:07] reason the husband and wife is no longer
[1:59:08] twain they're one
[1:59:10] godless church is one christ in you
[1:59:12] god's great revelation glory to god even
[1:59:14] bearing his name his name is jesus the
[1:59:16] anointed the reason he's called jesus
[1:59:18] he's the anointed it's the anointed body
[1:59:20] of christ proving manifested god like
[1:59:23] that body did and that body redeemed
[1:59:26] every bit of this these bodies and
[1:59:28] through their god works his threefold
[1:59:30] manifestation going to the kingdom risen
[1:59:33] paid the price we're redeemed god has
[1:59:35] proved it vindicated at sea and we stand
[1:59:38] justified in christ before him because
[1:59:40] he cannot pass judgment for he already
[1:59:42] judged that body speaking of the lord on
[1:59:44] the cross
[1:59:45] and which i'm part of
[1:59:47] oh how am i part of it here it is it's
[1:59:50] in me
[1:59:50] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:59:53] amen then what you say ask the father
[1:59:55] anything of my name it'll be done there
[1:59:56] it is gloria justified glory to god oh
[1:59:59] if i could get the world to see that
[2:00:01] wine there you are there is the body of
[2:00:03] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[2:00:06] oh my justified in his sight why are we
[2:00:08] justified we are his victory
[2:00:10] the church is his victory we come forth
[2:00:13] in this last days with this glorious
[2:00:15] gospel showing his victory he died for
[2:00:18] this purpose and we are the proof of his
[2:00:20] victory amen when we see him coming down
[2:00:23] and living among the church that's his
[2:00:26] victory
[2:00:27] it shows that he couldn't keep him in
[2:00:29] the grave neither can they keep us
[2:00:31] that's right we're bound right we're
[2:00:32] already potentially raised because we're
[2:00:34] raised from the dead unbelief in his
[2:00:36] word from denominational creeds to an
[2:00:38] eternal word of an eternal god which is
[2:00:41] him himself working through us
[2:00:43] manifesting himself like
[2:00:45] that here that is the same yesterday
[2:00:47] today and forever and then the word
[2:00:49] comes down into the body from the head
[2:00:51] what is it the same word nothing can be
[2:00:53] added or taken from it so that's the
[2:00:55] same word moves from the head as the day
[2:00:58] comes close down to the body down into
[2:01:00] the body vindicating they are one the
[2:01:03] husband and wife their flesh of his
[2:01:04] flesh word of his word life is life
[2:01:07] spirit of a spirit see amen how do you
[2:01:09] know it it bears the same record same
[2:01:12] fruit same word see manifest christ same
[2:01:15] life same god same spirit same word same
