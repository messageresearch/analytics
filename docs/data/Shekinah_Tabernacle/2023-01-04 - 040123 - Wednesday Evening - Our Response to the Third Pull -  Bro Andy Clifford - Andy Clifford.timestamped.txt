[34:19] Lord help us to just say a few things
[34:21] that would
[34:22] um encourage us and to oh yeah just
[34:26] encourage us amen let's turn to
[34:28] Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 to 5. and
[34:32] then we'll turn to 2p to one
[34:34] verses 19 to 21.
[34:38] and we're going to read scriptures here
[34:41] that have traditionally been very lofty
[34:43] ideas and lofty Revelations and events
[34:47] that have happened to the age and to
[34:49] dispensations and the great things
[34:51] that's happened in our generation but
[34:53] tonight I want you to make this personal
[34:56] and I believe that this is personal
[34:59] hey man Hallelujah amen I kind of
[35:03] preached a little bit of these things
[35:04] over there in Africa and I just had such
[35:06] a wonderful time and you know I was just
[35:08] listening to all the things that's been
[35:09] ministered at the at both meetings so
[35:11] we've heard all of that and
[35:13] um yeah I just was so encouraged I
[35:15] thought man I yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[35:18] I won't leave you standing too much
[35:20] longer let's just read Glory um and when
[35:22] he had opened the seventh seal
[35:25] there was silence in heaven about the
[35:27] space of half an hour and I saw the
[35:30] seven angels which stood before God and
[35:32] to them were given seven trumpets and
[35:35] another Angel another angel came and
[35:38] stood at the altar having a golden
[35:40] sensor and there was given unto him much
[35:43] incense
[35:44] that he should offer it with the prayers
[35:47] of All Saints upon the golden altar
[35:49] which was before the throne
[35:52] and the smoke of the incense which came
[35:54] with the prayers of the Saints are you
[35:56] glad that this has happened
[35:58] okay we're speaking about an event
[35:59] that's happened and it's happening okay
[36:01] it's happened and it's happening okay
[36:04] it's a it goes from age to individual
[36:07] amen hallelujah just so it's not just
[36:09] done and it's finished it's kind of
[36:10] happening still now in your life amen
[36:14] everyone say my life
[36:16] amen that's right that's happening to
[36:18] you hallelujah it's happening to me that
[36:20] he should offer it with the prayers of
[36:21] All Saints upon the golden altar which
[36:23] was before the throne and the smoke of
[36:25] the incense which came with the prayers
[36:27] of saints ascended up before God out of
[36:29] the Angel's hand and the angel took the
[36:31] sensor and filled it with fire off the
[36:33] Altar and cast it into the Earth aren't
[36:36] you glad for fire the fire of God Amen
[36:39] who loves the fire of God it does good
[36:41] things to our lives amen hallelujah
[36:43] burns out all the evil and the
[36:45] accentuates the good amen and Angel uh
[36:49] and cast it into the Earth and there
[36:51] were voices and thunderings and
[36:53] Lightnings and an earthquake amen and 2
[36:56] Peter 1 19-21 and it says just say Amen
[37:00] if you had your finger there is everyone
[37:02] there
[37:03] Hallelujah we have also
[37:06] a more sure word of Prophecy where until
[37:09] you do well that you take heed amen as
[37:12] unto a light that shines in a dark place
[37:16] Hallelujah unto the and now like so
[37:18] Peter's saying this for them then
[37:21] because it was happening light was
[37:22] shining in darkness but now he's going
[37:24] to speak of an event that's too still to
[37:26] take place in the future of their
[37:28] dispensation and now he says until
[37:32] so it's got this light's going to shine
[37:33] in a dark place until the day Dawn so
[37:38] now the coming of the Lord right so the
[37:40] so the light of the Gospel is going to
[37:42] shine all around the world it's going to
[37:44] shine through the apostolic move and
[37:45] through every Church age in darkness but
[37:48] then one day the day's gonna Dawn one
[37:51] day the coming of the Lord is going to
[37:52] take place right do you believe that
[37:54] okay let's see where it happens and the
[37:57] day start arrives where
[38:00] in your heart
[38:02] amen that's a very powerful thing and I
[38:05] pray that the Lord will reveal it to you
[38:06] not as a Doctrine but as an experience
[38:09] who wants that experience amen
[38:12] hallelujah I believe we're living in the
[38:14] age and the time and the hour where this
[38:16] is personal
[38:17] amen you may be seated
[38:20] I feel like I'm going to preach and I'm
[38:22] going to keep you standing too long so
[38:23] I'll just let you sit down Hallelujah so
[38:25] it says knowing this first that no
[38:27] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[38:30] private interpretation Hallelujah
[38:33] not just something you work out and you
[38:34] try and do in your own strength
[38:36] something that you try and make happen
[38:38] and you get excited and for me I have to
[38:40] surrender my own enthusiasm to stop
[38:43] making things happen around me whether
[38:45] it's natural things or even spiritual
[38:47] things right Hallelujah because
[38:49] different personalities they have
[38:51] different negative sides to them that
[38:53] can make us do things outside of the
[38:55] will of God and I want to touch on
[38:59] um that later on if the Lord be willing
[39:01] if we get to it
[39:02] for the prophecy came not an old time
[39:05] by the will of men
[39:07] but holy men of God spake as they were
[39:10] moved by the Holy Ghost
[39:13] wait on the Lord
[39:15] wait on your ministry
[39:17] don't don't try even though because you
[39:20] know now we're in the eagle age we can
[39:22] see right and we've got this great
[39:25] advantage to see
[39:27] and we've we can see everything that's
[39:29] gone on and happen and why and it's all
[39:31] built up and then we and as you and with
[39:33] the same Eagle anointing you begin to
[39:35] see the future because we've had a
[39:37] prophet a major prophet like Moses and
[39:39] Joshua come down in our day in the
[39:42] spirit of Elijah to come and give us
[39:45] that Vision now we can see what's going
[39:47] to happen but let's not try and make it
[39:49] happen hey man let's wait on our
[39:51] ministry right we've got to be patient
[39:53] with God true patience is not patience
[39:55] with men that's easy it's patience with
[39:57] God that's the thing amen patience with
[40:01] God and over the age we've seen many
[40:03] times and this is what causes politics
[40:06] in the message this is what causes
[40:07] troubles is when we go and try and do
[40:09] something in our own strength out of
[40:11] enthusiasm or out of seeing a vision
[40:13] seeing Revelation come and then teaching
[40:16] it rather than experiencing the reality
[40:18] of it
[40:19] you catch that
[40:21] because we can teach the seventh seal we
[40:23] can teach all these things that's
[40:24] happened the great events that's taken
[40:26] place in the coming of the Lord in our
[40:28] generation we can teach that but it's
[40:30] not Doctrine
[40:32] it's got to be an experience because the
[40:34] coming of the Lord is an event it's an
[40:37] event that happens on an individual
[40:38] level so as a collective we get raptured
[40:41] from the Lord himself who comes down
[40:43] into our lives to Rapture us out in a
[40:46] greater measure than any church has ever
[40:47] had it
[40:49] it's a cataclysmic change of
[40:51] dispensation in the end time who's who's
[40:54] with me on that who knows I don't
[40:56] understand but there had to come a time
[40:58] where we turned the corner and instead
[41:00] of just building on all of these
[41:01] denominational ideas and Roman
[41:03] Catholicism and all that big primordial
[41:05] soup
[41:07] if anyone knows what that means you can
[41:09] have a laugh at me
[41:11] I won't even go into it it's not worth
[41:13] it but
[41:16] I'm a time where we had to come out of
[41:18] all of that right
[41:19] and come into a New and Living Way of
[41:22] true restoration even further back than
[41:26] the apostles went
[41:28] amen
[41:29] now our hearts have been turned back to
[41:31] the hearts of our fathers right
[41:33] and we've always gone it's just to the
[41:35] apostles but it's further than the
[41:37] apostles it's back to the original
[41:39] religion that job was talked about that
[41:42] God spoke to job about that in the mind
[41:45] of God an eternity that never began and
[41:47] never ended you were dancing you were
[41:50] shouting and you were rejoicing and you
[41:52] were singing now right now you think oh
[41:55] my I had a beginning I was born and how
[41:58] could that be and yes we're in a little
[42:00] hickey of time but when you get back
[42:01] into eternity it's going to be like you
[42:04] never began
[42:05] oh my I can see smoke coming out of the
[42:08] ears Smoke's coming out
[42:10] but who cares let's just rejoice in the
[42:13] fact that that's you sometimes we don't
[42:15] understand it because we're we're in
[42:17] time right and you get so used to time
[42:20] and everything you begin this and then
[42:22] you finish there and you were born there
[42:23] and that one and and it's all we know
[42:25] right but God's eternal
[42:28] like this will bubble our mind if we
[42:30] really think about this Jesus standing
[42:32] before the Pharisees in his life and
[42:34] they're telling him oh you were how
[42:35] could Abraham know your day and then and
[42:37] then Jesus says before Abraham was I am
[42:42] I am it's like how does it work and so
[42:45] he would if it was a future thing he
[42:47] would say I am not I will be because he
[42:50] is he's an ever-present and not ever
[42:53] present in time ever present in eternity
[42:55] time is if he is even prison he's
[42:58] looking at time like this here's the
[43:00] Eden here's whatever civilizations he's
[43:02] done and started and wherever and here's
[43:03] the end of it but he's looking beyond
[43:05] that
[43:06] he's like oh yeah there and there and
[43:08] you pinned that down there and that down
[43:10] there and that there but he's looking
[43:11] Beyond it
[43:14] man
[43:15] Laurie
[43:22] it's cold here
[43:24] that's cool here I'm telling you oh mate
[43:28] but
[43:30] that was real hot over there my goodness
[43:36] amen
[43:38] I used to think it was hot here
[43:40] man
[43:42] oh my if you wanna you want Fitness
[43:46] you go over there and start ministering
[43:48] man
[43:49] brother and Paul knows about this my
[43:52] goodness
[43:53] hallelujah amen the prophet says this
[43:57] now I want to speak on a subject
[43:59] and I just kind of want to lay a
[44:01] foundation and I was listening to
[44:02] brother Isaac and he says I'm not going
[44:03] to just preach this because I want you
[44:04] to get it
[44:05] and I thought Lord help me just to say
[44:07] these things first so I can lay that
[44:10] I tried every time and Lord help me I
[44:13] really you know I really want that to
[44:14] happen but I just get so excited and you
[44:17] guys start pulling and everything just
[44:18] happens
[44:19] I was listening to brother Branham today
[44:21] and he was like man I just and it was
[44:23] who do you say this is in the sermon and
[44:26] he and he sang after he'd he'd done the
[44:28] whole sermon two hours and he'd hadn't
[44:29] only touched one thing and he says oh
[44:31] the Holy Ghost just takes over and I
[44:33] just get to that one point and I've got
[44:35] this whole page as the points so I felt
[44:37] like I know exactly how he means because
[44:40] you know the Lord is you know I think we
[44:43] Avail ourselves to the Lord
[44:45] to the anointing to the spirit of God
[44:47] and it's like you just become a vessel
[44:50] that he wants to meet the needs of his
[44:51] people and and needs are being met you
[44:53] know and I I just encourage you like you
[44:56] know I mean you guys are primed man
[44:58] you've had amazing camps and conventions
[45:01] and just like well Hallelujah man Prime
[45:04] so you know just invite them to your Pew
[45:06] once more
[45:07] uh just just once more Lord hallelujah
[45:10] and uh you know let this kind of
[45:13] spectrums you could say of different
[45:15] Ministries and and they and they have a
[45:17] certain spectrum that they are they are
[45:19] really anointed to push and and to
[45:22] preach and so I just really the the
[45:26] thought today is our response to the
[45:28] third pool
[45:29] because see the third pull has been and
[45:32] I want to explain what the three pools
[45:34] are because you know there's probably
[45:36] people that maybe don't understand what
[45:38] I mean by this terminology so I'll just
[45:40] explain that but you know what is our
[45:43] response to this and when it's personal
[45:46] to you your response because you're
[45:48] experiencing it
[45:50] your response is worship
[45:52] our response is a celebration with with
[45:56] God
[45:58] we're not just like filling ourselves up
[46:00] with a revelation and knowledge and I
[46:01] can explain it all but I've experienced
[46:04] it and it's happened to me and it's
[46:06] changed my life and I'm responding out
[46:09] of something in me just bubbles out
[46:12] because it's gone beyond the head it's
[46:14] gone beyond my This Heart even has just
[46:17] gone deeper it's become my whole life
[46:20] it's like a little white button as the
[46:22] Holy Ghost comes into your life the you
[46:24] know it comes in small like a light
[46:25] comes into you and then he begins to
[46:27] press out and he begins to push out all
[46:29] the complexes and push out all those
[46:31] roots of bitterness and things that
[46:33] happened in your life that's hindered
[46:34] your worship and and cultural you know
[46:37] ideologies that have shaded over your
[46:40] vision and it begins to push those
[46:42] things aside to introduce to you a
[46:45] Heavenly culture
[46:46] to introduce to you a Heavenly race
[46:49] without color
[46:51] just a Heavenly race a Heavenly people a
[46:54] heavenly vision and a Heavenly viewpoint
[46:58] now if we bring our stuff in we're going
[47:02] to be like the first time David tried to
[47:04] bring the ark into into a city of David
[47:06] right and all it led to was death
[47:09] who knows how David when he became king
[47:11] he there was two ceremonies one ceremony
[47:15] was completely on a cart it was done by
[47:18] they thought they could do a better way
[47:19] and and the house of abinadab where they
[47:22] up had been for years and years they've
[47:24] decided they wanted a part of this so
[47:25] they just continued on but actually the
[47:28] time was changing and so they brought it
[47:30] all out and David didn't consult the
[47:32] prophet or the message he consulted the
[47:34] armies and he he went on a political
[47:36] level and they brought it in and all it
[47:39] led to was death
[47:41] but when it was done and you can see now
[47:44] we can make it personal in our life if
[47:47] you bring any of your own ideas to this
[47:48] if you bring all that stuff that you've
[47:50] learned from denominational Theology and
[47:52] all that stuff out of Babylon
[47:54] it's all going to end in death because
[47:56] it's corrupted
[47:58] you have to just let all that teaching
[48:00] and all that stuff and put it on the
[48:01] shelf and let God and His will and his
[48:05] program go beyond the doctrine now and
[48:07] become an experience to take that Ark
[48:10] and put it in your life take it out of
[48:12] the because a lot of when you receive
[48:14] God into your life it's sitting in there
[48:16] all that potential everything's a new
[48:19] but it's lying in a place where it
[48:21] cannot be manifested because of all
[48:23] these complexes and things that's you're
[48:25] holding on to and God will never defy
[48:28] your free will he will never just press
[48:31] through your own mentality you've got to
[48:34] allow him
[48:35] you've got to surrender you've got to
[48:37] trust him I think there was something up
[48:39] there that just said I know it was my
[48:41] calendar and it just said and all things
[48:43] just trust him
[48:45] true trust and I pray tonight
[48:48] we're going through all these things
[48:49] whether you're 7 or 70.
[48:53] more older or younger doesn't matter if
[48:55] you're out anywhere we're going through
[48:57] life and you know we if we want to do
[49:02] things and you have Ambitions and you
[49:04] have little dreams and Big Dreams and if
[49:08] you don't trust God you will try and
[49:09] take that into your hands and try and
[49:11] control that thing and try and make that
[49:13] happen and all it will end in is death
[49:17] that's all there's no other option it
[49:20] might take ages for that to happen but
[49:21] it'll happen eventually
[49:23] and now death is not just you dying
[49:25] physically and going to another
[49:26] dimension death is separation from God
[49:31] separation from God the Creator
[49:34] the the source of love the source of of
[49:37] all light and life
[49:40] and you get separated from that like
[49:42] what is it worth
[49:44] to have to be cool at school to be the
[49:47] one that Everyone likes to be good at
[49:49] this and that but if you just trust God
[49:52] just trust him and I pray Lord help us
[49:54] to trust them I know it sounds very uh
[49:57] rudimentary but trusting God is a very
[49:59] important thing
[50:02] wow
[50:04] Hallelujah
[50:07] so our response to the third pull the
[50:10] seventh seal brings him the prophet says
[50:12] this in Souls that are in prison this
[50:14] because I talk about the seventh seal
[50:16] right because we just read when the
[50:19] seventh seal was opened and there was
[50:21] silence in heaven
[50:22] and there is silence but there will be a
[50:24] time where that silence is broken
[50:25] because it was only half an hour right
[50:28] so he put a time limit on the silence
[50:30] half an hour I don't know what prophetic
[50:32] half an hour is had me how many years
[50:34] but God has a time with the silence will
[50:37] be broken and the sons of God and the
[50:39] daughters of God will speak and they'll
[50:41] be manifested and the Earth will ring
[50:43] again
[50:44] and it'll be the nature that's groaning
[50:47] for this will finally have peace because
[50:50] the sons of God are back what Adam lost
[50:53] and everything that he forfeited will be
[50:56] restored again in the earth and identity
[50:57] conditions will be back right
[50:59] amen
[51:02] the seventh seal
[51:04] as the coming of the Lord or in another
[51:07] um uh aspect that brings the Lord to the
[51:11] Earth it brings Christ to the Earth so
[51:12] that the prophet sees this in in one of
[51:15] his last sermons that he preached
[51:16] actually I think I know it was in 1963.
[51:19] so it was towards the end of his
[51:20] ministry and he says the seventh seal
[51:22] brings him back to Earth
[51:24] the lamb come and took the book out of
[51:27] the right hand of him and sat down and
[51:30] claimed what he owned I like that
[51:33] it claimed what he owned so Calvary and
[51:36] everything that he did his blood that
[51:38] was spilled on the Earth was to purchase
[51:41] you it was to purchase me it was to
[51:44] purchase what we have it was to purchase
[51:46] the Earth it was to purchase nature it
[51:48] was to purchase the Jews
[51:50] it was to purchase all that he owned
[51:55] but and and through that dispensation he
[51:58] began to share that light shined in
[52:01] darkness through the seven Church ages
[52:02] and he begins to set people free and
[52:05] Liberate the people and and bring the
[52:07] people back but then there would come a
[52:09] time right at the very end and according
[52:11] to Daniel it was the time when when
[52:14] knowledge shall increase and Men shall
[52:17] run to and fro so there would be a great
[52:18] traveling age and a great a great age of
[52:21] knowledge increasing that would be when
[52:23] the book would open and this would
[52:25] happen the seals would break right and
[52:27] it happened right
[52:29] 1963 a major event took place in
[52:33] Civilization the seals were open but
[52:36] what that was was the final Act of
[52:38] redemption
[52:40] to claim
[52:42] to himself everything that Calvary
[52:45] purchased
[52:46] because the purchase went and then he
[52:48] went searching and he went preaching and
[52:50] like shining in darkness but there had
[52:52] to come a time where all of it would
[52:54] open and then he would come down and he
[52:56] would take his bride out of the Earth
[52:59] and he would redeem us back
[53:01] so there had to come a time now
[53:04] that is the thing that brings people to
[53:08] a showdown
[53:09] can you receive that can you see that
[53:12] now the best thing to do in this
[53:13] situation is to neutralize everything
[53:16] and you're it you know and your ideas
[53:19] and and to say Lord is this true
[53:23] is this for me I I Lord I I if this is
[53:26] true this is cataclysmic this means
[53:27] great things and the coming of the Lord
[53:30] has begun
[53:31] because now he's come down he's revealed
[53:33] himself and he's come down into the
[53:34] people's hearts to redeem people back
[53:36] and take them and claim what is
[53:38] purchased so the first things that he
[53:41] claims because all those that have died
[53:42] in Christ all the way from Adam they've
[53:45] already they're already up in this
[53:46] situation but there's a people that he
[53:49] wants to display on the earth that are
[53:51] alive that are going to come all the way
[53:53] back to their origin living in the flesh
[53:57] it's like a showdown between God and
[54:00] Satan he's gonna say I can do this this
[54:02] is what my blood can do this is what my
[54:04] salvation can do this is how powerful I
[54:06] am I'm gonna take a bride who's in
[54:08] Satan's Eden and the greatest evil where
[54:10] knowledge is everywhere and iPads and
[54:12] phones and all the rubbish all over and
[54:16] not this she's gonna be just like me
[54:18] she's going to be redeemed out of the
[54:20] trash redeemed out of it and I know my
[54:22] own life I was in the real dark
[54:25] I was I was seriously in the dark drugs
[54:28] alcohol gangs the whole lot and he
[54:32] redeemed me Hallelujah if he could
[54:34] redeem me he can redeem you
[54:37] can redeem all
[54:39] and now he's searching because this is
[54:41] the time where it's not only will you
[54:44] believe and then die and then have a
[54:46] resurrection one day but there has to be
[54:49] a people that defy death
[54:51] there has to be something more than any
[54:53] other age
[54:54] something more
[54:56] that's the people that get victory over
[54:58] death itself
[55:00] and that's the only one that can do it
[55:02] is the one that abolished it he would
[55:04] come down in full measure he would come
[55:07] down and he would reveal himself in his
[55:09] people
[55:11] we've got something to celebrate
[55:13] we've got something to dance about
[55:15] we've got something to celebrate we've
[55:16] got something to talk about
[55:18] we're not just preaching denominational
[55:20] Theology of a God that died for us 2000
[55:22] years ago and if you just believe and
[55:24] say the sinner's prayer you'll be saved
[55:26] and you'll come to the white Throne
[55:27] judgment too and then your sins and
[55:30] everything will be because you've you
[55:32] all you've done is come to a historical
[55:34] God but of that God if you really come
[55:36] as provided way and you get baptized in
[55:39] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[55:40] remission of your sins just as the
[55:42] apostles did
[55:43] and you come that provided way of true
[55:46] repentance from all that
[55:47] denominationalism all that darkness and
[55:49] truly enter into that and His holy ghost
[55:52] comes down into you
[55:53] you've got everything
[55:55] you've got it all
[55:58] you've got it all you've got the coming
[55:59] of the Lord in your heart
[56:01] that's not something else it's the Holy
[56:04] Ghost
[56:06] every age the Holy Ghost had a
[56:07] prerogative he had a plan he had a he
[56:09] had a dispensation to dispense right
[56:11] dispense something you dispense a whole
[56:13] lot of himself to the apostles and the
[56:15] angel Lord was there and they had an
[56:16] Apostolic age and so on and so forth all
[56:19] the way through
[56:20] Hallelujah he took a portion of himself
[56:23] the Earth the churches went into Dark
[56:25] Ages and denominationalism everywhere
[56:27] and it just was like a tyranny and then
[56:29] he began to restore back under Luther
[56:31] and Martin and Luther and Wesley and and
[56:34] brought it back up again
[56:36] Hallelujah and they had a portion of the
[56:39] Holy Spirit
[56:40] he gave them certain things to overcome
[56:42] in their day but then the seed has to
[56:45] return the fullness has to return where
[56:48] the fullness full measure of what went
[56:50] on the ground in the beginning and
[56:51] Christ himself would be manifested in
[56:53] his church
[56:54] so that the full seed and the life
[56:57] you know the seed
[57:00] has everything in it that was in the
[57:02] original
[57:03] plant
[57:05] it has to come back to seed again
[57:08] it's nature right
[57:10] it can't just remain
[57:13] a leaf
[57:15] what they had in the Lutheran day they
[57:16] had a leaf
[57:18] now the life was in the leaf it was
[57:19] green it photosynthesized the Sun
[57:22] but it was just it was just there right
[57:24] they were all there and all that
[57:25] denominationalism that came out in that
[57:27] day when God was there but what happened
[57:30] the purpose of the leaf is to bring the
[57:32] sunlight
[57:33] and turn it into some further part of
[57:36] the plant as it comes up as the shark
[57:38] and now well the tassel and then and
[57:41] that was like as the denominational tree
[57:42] was developing then it developed into
[57:44] the shuck and now look that was
[57:47] Pentecost and the charismatic movement
[57:48] and they're still around right in
[57:51] different countries it's in different
[57:52] conditions here it's completely lost
[57:54] they're completely in the world and
[57:56] they're attached to the world actually
[57:57] all denominations are attached by an
[57:59] umbilical cord to the world
[58:01] and as the world crumbles they crumble
[58:03] and as the world goes down you watch
[58:05] them they are going in Mosin and Mawson
[58:08] and they look like the world they act
[58:09] like the world their only way to keep
[58:11] people is to be like the world
[58:13] because they're attached
[58:15] now when they were in their Heyday when
[58:17] the life was in the plant and the Holy
[58:19] Ghost was pouring out the spiritual
[58:21] gifts
[58:24] that was good it was God
[58:27] but what they did
[58:28] a prophecy went forth on those early
[58:30] days of Pentecost and said do not
[58:32] denominate and do not put a uh uh what
[58:35] do you call that thing an evidence to
[58:37] the Holy Ghost baptism
[58:39] what effect did the Lord knew they were
[58:41] going to do it
[58:42] because man is man right as soon as fear
[58:44] comes in to try and control the
[58:46] denomination can keep what they had not
[58:49] realizing that God is more
[58:51] amen that God is so great there's a
[58:53] comma at the end of what we know
[58:55] there's a comma at the end of everything
[58:57] you believe right if there isn't you've
[58:59] denominated
[59:00] you're stuck you're there stagnated
[59:02] plateau
[59:04] that's all you'll ever do but if you
[59:05] just put a comma and you say God tonight
[59:07] so anyway the life was in them and and
[59:11] God told them do not denominate and this
[59:13] is in the early 1900s and do not put on
[59:16] evidence what do they do they place an
[59:18] Evidence of speaking in tongues is the
[59:20] sign that you were baptized with the
[59:22] Holy Ghost sealed to the day of your
[59:23] Redemption and many witches came into
[59:25] those services and spoken tongues
[59:28] through those people and they do today
[59:29] and they go off in tongues that's demons
[59:34] demons are cursing the church
[59:36] I'm telling you I've actually heard
[59:39] testimonies of ex-witches and warlocks
[59:41] and they were assigned to churches and
[59:44] every time those foolish people God
[59:47] bless them I pray for their salvation
[59:49] but every time they blab it away those
[59:52] demons and those witches would enter in
[59:54] and speak curses of lust fear and
[59:57] Division and whatever
[1:00:00] over the church
[1:00:01] and they had a great time in there they
[1:00:04] said the the churches that followed the
[1:00:06] word they couldn't do anything in them I
[1:00:08] mean they could cause a little bit of
[1:00:09] trouble but not like that because they
[1:00:11] had a tons and interpreter
[1:00:14] he said and they say when there's an
[1:00:16] interpreter now we already heard this in
[1:00:18] the message right
[1:00:19] now see the prophet doesn't go and
[1:00:21] explain all those things he just says
[1:00:22] don't do it and we think oh why and then
[1:00:24] that's why but one reason anyway
[1:00:28] God gives wisdom right Hallelujah
[1:00:32] so here's the shuck and you know the
[1:00:34] Pentecostal Church
[1:00:36] um the Heyday was all green and that
[1:00:39] shuck and the wheat looks just like the
[1:00:41] wheat almost except it's big and green
[1:00:43] and it's sticking up right very and all
[1:00:46] the gifts are there the the restoration
[1:00:48] of all the gifts that they denominated
[1:00:50] and they begin to fight and they had all
[1:00:52] these evidences and one went to extreme
[1:00:54] Oneness like your finger God is one like
[1:00:56] your finger and then one went to extreme
[1:00:58] trinitarian they polarized be careful
[1:01:01] you don't polarize in the message
[1:01:02] be careful you don't pull too far to one
[1:01:05] side in the message and go too far that
[1:01:07] way because responding to that we've
[1:01:09] heard that preach right don't let the
[1:01:11] reason that your stance is this because
[1:01:13] of anger or because you're fighting
[1:01:15] against something that's the wrong
[1:01:16] Foundation
[1:01:18] Hallelujah let God be let us will come
[1:01:21] wait on your ministry wait on God and
[1:01:23] let him move you
[1:01:25] let the spirit of God move you
[1:01:27] and so here they are in this great move
[1:01:31] of God but God wasn't finished with a
[1:01:33] shook even though it looked like it in
[1:01:35] Pentecost they thought that they were
[1:01:37] the very Cutting Edge and that was it
[1:01:40] God wasn't finished with the shark who
[1:01:42] knows anything about wheat and you can
[1:01:44] go research it the shark has to pull
[1:01:46] away
[1:01:47] and then what it does is it reveals this
[1:01:49] Grain on the inside and that grain the
[1:01:52] shuck the Pentecostal and charismatic
[1:01:55] move pulled away from the word
[1:01:57] unfortunately that's just nature and
[1:01:59] that's what happened they pulled away
[1:02:01] they rejected the message they begin to
[1:02:04] ostracize the prophet in his ministry
[1:02:06] and they pulled away because he
[1:02:09] basically told them they were living in
[1:02:10] sin and all those things and they had to
[1:02:11] come up for reason to their congregation
[1:02:13] why not to believe this so they
[1:02:15] basically sealed their Doom those
[1:02:18] ministers just like the Pharisees sealed
[1:02:20] their Doom when they said crucify him
[1:02:22] and the prophet raised up with a message
[1:02:24] called indictment under the inspiration
[1:02:27] of the Holy Ghost and indicted those
[1:02:29] ministers for crucifying the word they
[1:02:31] pulled away they put their congregations
[1:02:33] and they had councils in every country
[1:02:35] should we receive it or not and if they
[1:02:38] said no that was rejected it was a false
[1:02:40] prophet and all those things they pulled
[1:02:42] away and revealed the Grain and the
[1:02:45] Grain in the seed is everything that was
[1:02:48] in the original
[1:02:50] and that is the full restoration of the
[1:02:53] word now that is the Holy Ghost still
[1:02:55] the same Holy Spirit but now
[1:02:58] I always like to demonstrate this yay
[1:03:01] there's a Bible here hallelujah
[1:03:05] all the other ages when the Holy Spirit
[1:03:07] came the book was still right
[1:03:10] and he would reveal a portion of himself
[1:03:12] and a portion here and a portion there
[1:03:14] and things that was to do with that age
[1:03:16] and you can read it in Revelation
[1:03:17] Chapter 2 and chapter 3 about what he
[1:03:19] would do in those ages but there would
[1:03:21] come a time at the end where he himself
[1:03:23] would come and the book would be open
[1:03:26] and all the inheritance and everything
[1:03:28] that's in there would be extended like
[1:03:30] the scepter was extended to Esther who
[1:03:33] knows the story of Esther when she came
[1:03:35] up under that prophet's Ministry a guy
[1:03:37] who knew the heart of the king even to
[1:03:39] the point of what she should wear that's
[1:03:41] why you think oh this Prophet is so
[1:03:43] legalistic and telling you all the stuff
[1:03:45] to wear it's not legalistic it's a
[1:03:47] revelation it's a revelation of the
[1:03:49] heart of the king Hallelujah who
[1:03:51] believes that that you have received a
[1:03:53] revelation of the heart of the king
[1:03:55] through an anointed Prophet Vindicated
[1:03:57] to close you to preach a message to you
[1:04:00] so that when you appear before the king
[1:04:02] he will see himself in female form he
[1:04:06] will see his wife already never met her
[1:04:08] before and by eye and then he see either
[1:04:11] and she's just like him she smells like
[1:04:13] him she walks like him she been close
[1:04:15] Hallelujah
[1:04:16] that was that was a good Ministry and
[1:04:19] maybe he didn't understand why should I
[1:04:20] wear this funny thing
[1:04:22] and all the others all the other girls
[1:04:23] in the Harem they could use their own
[1:04:24] imagination just like the denominations
[1:04:26] what do they come up with their own
[1:04:29] ideas on how to please God
[1:04:31] very sincere right I will never take
[1:04:33] anything away from their sincerity and
[1:04:35] we cannot even unchristianize them
[1:04:37] they're just not called to this
[1:04:40] they're called to a whosoever we'll call
[1:04:43] him whosoever will let them come but
[1:04:45] there's another calling a higher calling
[1:04:47] a bride calling a bridegroom is calling
[1:04:49] to a bride a chosen before the
[1:04:51] foundation of the world predestinated
[1:04:53] with a seed in her heart to come forth
[1:05:01] Hallelujah
[1:05:03] let me just take a drink
[1:05:11] I forgot where I was
[1:05:13] it'll come back
[1:05:15] but
[1:05:16] this Pentecostal move as they pulled
[1:05:19] away revealed the grain now that grain
[1:05:22] had all the very things in it I was at
[1:05:24] Esther that's right the grain had all
[1:05:26] the the inflammation and all the life
[1:05:30] in every seed right so in the wheat
[1:05:32] there's all these seeds and in them
[1:05:35] when you plant that seed in the ground
[1:05:37] it's going to bring forth another wheat
[1:05:39] and you're so blessed when this message
[1:05:42] now it's seed again
[1:05:44] it's not Leaf it's not tassel it's not
[1:05:48] shuck it's seed and it's not that we're
[1:05:51] any better they were in Revival in their
[1:05:53] day but God wasn't finished
[1:05:55] and the whole idea is that all the
[1:05:58] people continue moving with God but the
[1:06:00] curse of denomination is this is us this
[1:06:03] is what we've got and fear comes on the
[1:06:04] people to hold the people in a still
[1:06:07] frame religion they take a photo of it
[1:06:09] that's it they put all the big things up
[1:06:11] they have theological schools to hold
[1:06:13] the people it's the whole thing but God
[1:06:16] is a being God is a supernatural being
[1:06:19] and he's never to be boxed into
[1:06:21] theological boxers he's never to be
[1:06:24] contained in our own pitiful little
[1:06:26] imaginations
[1:06:28] don't let your imagination rule your
[1:06:30] life
[1:06:31] don't let your ideas rule your life all
[1:06:33] it will lead to is death
[1:06:36] Hallelujah you know David when he
[1:06:38] brought that arkhan first
[1:06:40] he wanted to bring it to the city of
[1:06:42] David
[1:06:43] and and he wanted to make it all for
[1:06:45] himself because he heard that there was
[1:06:46] so much blessings in the house of
[1:06:47] abinadab so he went rushing ahead and
[1:06:49] maybe just maybe this was me maybe he
[1:06:52] didn't want to consult Nathaniel this
[1:06:53] time maybe he just wanted to quickly get
[1:06:55] his army together because he wanted the
[1:06:57] blessing but it was just a bit soon
[1:06:58] right and it wasn't ready but if you
[1:07:01] look at the second time he brings the
[1:07:02] ark
[1:07:03] he's already prepared a tent in
[1:07:06] Jerusalem not in the city of David in
[1:07:09] Jerusalem this time so it's the second
[1:07:11] time comes to the place that's prepared
[1:07:13] and ready and that's like us trying to
[1:07:15] make things happen trying to make this
[1:07:17] trying to preach and teach the seventh
[1:07:19] seal to fill people's knowledge and try
[1:07:21] and make it all happen and push people
[1:07:23] into the third pole it's like a third
[1:07:25] push
[1:07:26] right and the response is a legal
[1:07:29] response we've got to do this and fear
[1:07:31] comes on the people we've got to make
[1:07:32] this happen the coming of the Lord
[1:07:34] but really it's him
[1:07:36] and when you wait and when it's a season
[1:07:38] and the tent is ready
[1:07:41] this is the tent
[1:07:44] that's why we dance
[1:07:46] that's why we Shout
[1:07:48] we've got something to shout about
[1:07:50] that's why we celebrate that's why we
[1:07:52] have Pentecost and not a denomination
[1:07:55] we've got a real Pentecost we've got a
[1:07:58] real tambourine and a real drama we've
[1:08:00] got a reason to dance
[1:08:01] we've got a reason to sin we've got a
[1:08:04] reason to celebrate
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:07] a real reason is beyond
[1:08:09] Beyond
[1:08:10] trying to make it happen
[1:08:13] Hallelujah
[1:08:16] Hallelujah so the pools I just want to
[1:08:18] explain I'm probably going to run out of
[1:08:19] time oh my so the pool
[1:08:22] there's three pools in Jesus ministry
[1:08:24] right
[1:08:25] so the first pull was the healing of the
[1:08:28] second all of the and it created a huge
[1:08:30] following right everyone loved it all
[1:08:33] the Abram was inviting and he was ahead
[1:08:36] of great time and everyone was getting
[1:08:37] healed then the second was the
[1:08:39] Discerning of the Huts when he began to
[1:08:41] tell the secrets of the hearts and begin
[1:08:43] to challenge the Pharisees and challenge
[1:08:45] the sin of the age and his popularity
[1:08:48] starts to go down but there's still an
[1:08:50] attraction and they all want to see it
[1:08:52] because they're all Amazed by it right
[1:08:53] even the Pharaoh a lot of the Pharisees
[1:08:55] and the high priests and all of the
[1:08:57] sanhedrans they were if Nicodemus came
[1:08:59] to him and said we know that you're a
[1:09:00] teacher come from God but there was
[1:09:03] still a pressure that they couldn't
[1:09:04] really receive it right but it was the
[1:09:06] second pull of his ministry it's like
[1:09:08] fishing you pull the you put the rod in
[1:09:11] little bait and you wait for the little
[1:09:13] fish and when it starts nibbling you
[1:09:15] just give it a little tug and it hooks
[1:09:18] that little fish now that causes a
[1:09:20] scattering then bigger fish come when
[1:09:22] the big fish come and the second pool
[1:09:25] then it attracts the elect the rainbow
[1:09:28] trout starts swimming what's going on
[1:09:30] what's Happening and then the third pool
[1:09:32] comes and that's the pull that the
[1:09:34] rainbow trout hello rainbow trout right
[1:09:37] so now Jesus third pull I just wanted to
[1:09:40] put that in there but the third pull of
[1:09:41] Jesus was when he began to speak the
[1:09:44] word and when he spoke the word it said
[1:09:47] that all left him and oh he said he just
[1:09:51] said it like unless you eat my flesh and
[1:09:52] drink my blood you've got no life in you
[1:09:56] and all left they said this is a hard
[1:09:58] saying so the word came so strong that
[1:10:02] all the churches begin to leave ten
[1:10:04] thousand of his friends would leave him
[1:10:06] right and all the people begin to leave
[1:10:08] Jesus and he was preaching the fullness
[1:10:10] of the word and he began to share all
[1:10:12] the prophetic things and the mysteries
[1:10:14] of the Kingdom to the apostles and only
[1:10:16] the apostles remained
[1:10:18] and then he said to he even said to them
[1:10:20] he said
[1:10:21] will you go too
[1:10:23] he's not see the Lord is not afraid to
[1:10:26] test predestination to see what's inside
[1:10:28] the people
[1:10:30] and so when he begins to preach the
[1:10:32] truth
[1:10:33] the truth is what sets the people free
[1:10:35] right and it divides the light from
[1:10:37] Darkness separates the sheep from the
[1:10:39] goats all those things right and so he
[1:10:41] begins to preach the truth and he
[1:10:43] preaches these things and it causes all
[1:10:44] these people to leave him that's the
[1:10:45] third pull it hooks the Believers
[1:10:47] because Peter stood up and he said unto
[1:10:50] whom shall we go for thou has the words
[1:10:52] of eternal life so he's now recognizing
[1:10:55] that this one who God revealed to him
[1:10:58] was the Son of God the Christ the
[1:11:00] Messiah also had the words of eternal
[1:11:03] life so the word had the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:05] Seed form and he began to preach it and
[1:11:08] they would receive it and it would give
[1:11:10] them eternal life
[1:11:11] that was the third Paul attracting the
[1:11:14] elect
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:17] same as in the prophet's Ministry in the
[1:11:19] first pull
[1:11:21] as I was with Moses so shall I be with B
[1:11:23] he said to brother Branham in the cave
[1:11:25] and said as Moses was given
[1:11:27] um two signs you shall be given two
[1:11:29] signs one your hand it will desert you
[1:11:32] know you'll be able to heal the sick so
[1:11:33] the prophet went out there and took a
[1:11:35] Ministry of healing to the World on the
[1:11:37] first pull people would come up he'd
[1:11:40] take their hand and left and left I
[1:11:41] think and it would show these things and
[1:11:43] he would it just said don't the angel of
[1:11:45] the Lord said to him don't just think
[1:11:46] what you're going to let I'll say it
[1:11:48] right so the Lord began to discern the
[1:11:50] sicknesses and things on based on his
[1:11:52] hand and the a great Healing Ministry a
[1:11:55] Revival that spearheaded the whole
[1:11:56] charismatic move everything the the
[1:11:59] modern healing Revival was spearheaded
[1:12:01] by this ministry and nothing even came
[1:12:04] even close because most of it was carnal
[1:12:06] impersonations most of it was people
[1:12:08] because as you know he the prophet began
[1:12:12] to tell everyone how it all worked and
[1:12:13] how it was happening and that caused all
[1:12:15] these other ministers to come Oral
[1:12:17] Roberts and all those people Atomic
[1:12:19] Hooks and all of them to the they were
[1:12:21] so like enthused by this they wanted it
[1:12:23] and brother Ben said look that's in the
[1:12:25] it's in the atonement go for it right so
[1:12:29] they went for it and under the
[1:12:30] inspiration of the hour they begin
[1:12:32] healing Ministries all over the world
[1:12:33] but it was really God was sending one
[1:12:36] man
[1:12:37] with a message right but first Paul was
[1:12:39] to create a big following of people and
[1:12:42] all the churches loved him then the Lord
[1:12:45] said if you be sincere under the second
[1:12:47] pull of his ministry he said if you be
[1:12:49] sincere then it will be come to pass
[1:12:52] that you'll know the very secrets of the
[1:12:53] hearts and as they come up Visions would
[1:12:56] form and you would tell them the secrets
[1:12:57] of their hearts and that happened right
[1:12:59] and the people still loved them and all
[1:13:01] of that but under that inspiration sin
[1:13:04] was being discerned as well and so the
[1:13:06] word but getting stronger and stronger
[1:13:08] and stronger as you know in the 56's up
[1:13:11] to 62 the word was getting stronger and
[1:13:14] stronger the Hebrews came and the church
[1:13:16] ages came and it was starting to Dawn
[1:13:19] right a new day was Dawning a lot light
[1:13:22] was coming up and it was starting to
[1:13:24] change
[1:13:26] oh no I just gotta drink some water
[1:13:29] Hallelujah get dry
[1:13:33] it's starting to Dawn light was coming
[1:13:35] up right
[1:13:37] the second pull of his ministry but then
[1:13:39] the the Lord spoke to the prophet and he
[1:13:43] said now it's time you guys I want you
[1:13:46] to take my church into the fullness of
[1:13:48] the word
[1:13:49] I want you to take my people turn
[1:13:52] northward as I was with Moses so shall I
[1:13:54] be with you now Pentecost and the
[1:13:57] charismatic movement at that time and
[1:13:58] it's Heyday was at cadus barnia and they
[1:14:01] were eating of the fruit of the Lamb the
[1:14:03] spies had women the ministers would go
[1:14:05] in they would take all the gifts and
[1:14:07] they would Minister the gifts of healing
[1:14:09] to the congregations but they weren't
[1:14:11] even in the Promised Land
[1:14:12] they were eating of the fruit of the
[1:14:14] promised land but not in the land
[1:14:16] now that's so close you get so far
[1:14:19] and you know what happened when Mo when
[1:14:22] Joshua's Ministry started to manifest
[1:14:24] and started to shine then and the people
[1:14:27] got angry the churches the Pentecostals
[1:14:29] started getting angry at the prophet
[1:14:30] Joshua in that time and they said oh
[1:14:34] Rara let us make a captain and return to
[1:14:36] Egypt not realizing that the coming of
[1:14:39] the Lord was just across Jordan not
[1:14:41] realizing that God had a captain on the
[1:14:43] other side he had a mighty Angel a
[1:14:45] captain with a sword waiting for them to
[1:14:47] lead them in their promised land and
[1:14:49] here they are on cater spania just
[1:14:51] having the gifts
[1:14:52] just having tongues interpretation you
[1:14:55] know all of those things you know uh
[1:14:57] prophecies and healing and they were
[1:14:59] like they were relishing around the
[1:15:01] gifts of the giver but they didn't have
[1:15:02] the giver himself and for measure they
[1:15:05] had his gifts and they still have his
[1:15:07] gifts right you go to a Pentecostal
[1:15:09] Church you go to a charismatic church
[1:15:10] they're full of gifts they're full of
[1:15:13] Faith they can do Miracles they can do
[1:15:15] all those things raise the dead Reinhard
[1:15:18] bonkey goes to Africa I don't know he's
[1:15:19] probably I think he's died I don't know
[1:15:21] but anyway he's a great manifestations
[1:15:24] but they're still in the in the
[1:15:26] wilderness
[1:15:27] the encoder spaniel right next to the
[1:15:29] promising
[1:15:30] right close and I want to tell you if
[1:15:34] you were there
[1:15:35] if you're there you're so close
[1:15:38] yet so far
[1:15:41] so close
[1:15:43] yet so far
[1:15:48] so they were standing there
[1:15:50] and they were
[1:15:52] on that side of Jordan and you know what
[1:15:54] they said we're gonna make a cat
[1:15:56] because they were carnal they were
[1:15:58] fighting against this Prophet because
[1:16:00] they were getting tired of these things
[1:16:01] and they said we'll make a captain and
[1:16:03] we'll go back to Egypt
[1:16:05] so that they but then God called this
[1:16:07] Prophet under his third pull of his
[1:16:08] ministry now
[1:16:10] to take the people into the Promised
[1:16:12] Land
[1:16:12] now the vision of the third pool
[1:16:14] remember this he was fishing and he
[1:16:17] pulled the line and he got in trouble by
[1:16:19] the angel of the Lord for pulling too
[1:16:20] hard and then and and the Lord said
[1:16:23] don't teach these ministers all these
[1:16:25] things this stuff is not to be taught
[1:16:28] but anyway brother Branham on the second
[1:16:30] pull he starts explaining all to the
[1:16:32] ministers and all Tommy Hicks and all of
[1:16:35] that right all these ministers in the
[1:16:37] charismatic movement and everything at
[1:16:38] all where their Founders were
[1:16:40] he was teaching them all about and he
[1:16:42] would explain it because he he he just
[1:16:44] likes to explain everything right he
[1:16:45] wants everyone to know he wants everyone
[1:16:47] to get saved so bad he said
[1:16:49] that he just can't hold it back he just
[1:16:50] wants to share it all but you watch
[1:16:52] Jesus himself never shared all those
[1:16:54] things
[1:16:55] he never said anything about how the
[1:16:56] spirit works and what happened before
[1:16:58] the found before the world ever began
[1:17:00] but a prophet who could see the same
[1:17:01] things as Jesus because he had that same
[1:17:03] Messianic gift in his life to discern
[1:17:05] the hearts the word was in him right
[1:17:07] like what the logos word was in him like
[1:17:09] it was in Christ and it was in this
[1:17:11] Prophet to do the same things to show
[1:17:13] the sign of the Messiah right It's The
[1:17:15] Sign of the Messiah and and he could see
[1:17:17] all those things but the prophet now was
[1:17:19] explaining it to everyone
[1:17:21] and they all started impersonating it
[1:17:24] and doing it and that's what this big
[1:17:25] huge movement and the Angela said I told
[1:17:28] you
[1:17:29] do not tell them all these things
[1:17:32] and he was all tangled in the line right
[1:17:34] and he's crying he said Lord forgive
[1:17:36] your poor stupid servant or whatever he
[1:17:37] said
[1:17:38] no no that's why he said I'm not saying
[1:17:40] that just to make that clear
[1:17:43] now
[1:17:44] and then he said and then and then he
[1:17:46] said all of a sudden I was lifted way up
[1:17:50] he said way up something bigger and
[1:17:53] greater was now gonna pull him into a
[1:17:56] higher vision
[1:17:57] right and so the prophet got lifted way
[1:18:00] up way out of this thing
[1:18:02] all of that age all that Wilderness all
[1:18:05] of that primordial soup of religion way
[1:18:07] out of it and up into a big room and the
[1:18:11] angel of the Lord the pillar of fire
[1:18:12] went over to this brown box and the
[1:18:15] people walked into that brown box and
[1:18:17] they came out healed right and the angel
[1:18:19] of the Lord said to brother Branham
[1:18:21] I this is the third pull
[1:18:23] and it's not a public show
[1:18:25] right and I'll meet you in there and I
[1:18:28] know you've heard this right I'm just
[1:18:30] doing this as a little Foundation
[1:18:31] because we're going to hit something in
[1:18:32] a minute but
[1:18:34] um and and so and and the prophet says I
[1:18:36] don't understand
[1:18:38] what do you mean I'll meet you in there
[1:18:39] you know like because this is like as he
[1:18:41] and he's like this is the third pool how
[1:18:43] does this work and the prophet even
[1:18:44] thought that there would be a tent
[1:18:45] Ministry and all that sort of stuff
[1:18:46] right because he was kind of figuring it
[1:18:47] out but not realizing that now it's
[1:18:50] going to go beyond it's going to become
[1:18:52] a personal visitation of the Lord
[1:18:54] himself in a wooden box
[1:19:00] hello wooden boxes
[1:19:02] moving tents right
[1:19:04] Beyond Doctrine beyond all these funny
[1:19:06] ideas of man beyond it all Beyond
[1:19:08] preaching about it and I'm sorry I'm
[1:19:10] kind of preaching about it but it's I'm
[1:19:12] trying to say look it's not just
[1:19:14] knowledge
[1:19:15] it's like look open your heart and say
[1:19:18] Lord I want that if this is what's going
[1:19:20] to bring Rapture and faith in my life
[1:19:22] Lord manifest it Lord meet me in there
[1:19:25] meet me in here God wants to meet you in
[1:19:28] here
[1:19:28] and sometimes I think to myself look
[1:19:30] when I'm praying I'm looking up and
[1:19:32] looking down and and actually isn't it
[1:19:35] and I'm like how do I look in here oh my
[1:19:38] but he's in there
[1:19:40] and so one of the greatest events in
[1:19:42] history
[1:19:43] the coming of the Lord the second coming
[1:19:45] is already happening in side hearts
[1:19:48] the greatest measure of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] that's ever been given to the churches
[1:19:51] ever been given to anyone
[1:19:54] even in the Old Testament they are
[1:19:55] externally worshiped
[1:19:57] and I love this if David could have such
[1:20:00] an a a joy and a dance before the Lord
[1:20:03] and he wasn't even in him he was dancing
[1:20:06] around and the Lord dancing with him
[1:20:08] around this Ark and he was rejoicing and
[1:20:11] dancing and he wasn't even inside him
[1:20:13] how much more us
[1:20:15] who has the the very King the very God
[1:20:19] Of Heaven and you how much more
[1:20:23] you don't have to go to some tent or
[1:20:25] some Temple
[1:20:27] you are the temple and you can dance
[1:20:30] right and I was dancing in Africa and I
[1:20:32] was like having it I was just like man
[1:20:33] and I was running around and dancing
[1:20:37] and I was like you know what it doesn't
[1:20:39] matter if I'm here at home at work at
[1:20:42] school
[1:20:44] the coming of the Lord is in me
[1:20:46] and I got something to dance about I got
[1:20:48] something to celebrate
[1:20:49] amen
[1:20:51] Hallelujah
[1:20:53] you got something to celebrate and if
[1:20:56] the coming of the Lord hasn't happened
[1:20:57] in you there ain't going to be no
[1:20:59] Rapture for you
[1:21:00] you're going to go on to the Great
[1:21:01] Tribulation and what you have to give
[1:21:03] there is far more
[1:21:06] on a physical level you're going to have
[1:21:09] to be murdered and tortured for your
[1:21:11] faith who would rather I just want to
[1:21:13] give you a you can tick any box
[1:21:16] do you take to give your life now
[1:21:18] or to be tortured who wants to give
[1:21:20] their life now
[1:21:22] hey man I'm not putting fear on you or
[1:21:24] anything I'm just saying this is just
[1:21:25] the two choices because if you really
[1:21:27] you know this is serious
[1:21:29] you know if if we if you just keep your
[1:21:31] own ideas and keep your own religion and
[1:21:34] keep your own past historical God but
[1:21:37] it's just ideas and just Supernatural
[1:21:39] things but not really the person then
[1:21:41] it's going to be that it's going to be
[1:21:44] tribulation and let me tell you God has
[1:21:47] his people going into tribulation too
[1:21:48] now it's not as elect bride but it's
[1:21:51] he's still Preparing People for that
[1:21:53] because that's where they're called to
[1:21:55] that's true
[1:21:57] there are people and I you know at first
[1:22:00] I thought I'll make this just all false
[1:22:01] prophecies and they're just having an
[1:22:03] enthusiastic time and they're having
[1:22:04] prophecies in the charismatic churches
[1:22:06] and then Pentecost and all of the other
[1:22:08] whatever ecommunical things that's going
[1:22:10] on prepare for the tribulation thus
[1:22:12] serve the Lord get all your stores ready
[1:22:15] right and I used to think man let's just
[1:22:18] enthusiasm or whatever and they're just
[1:22:20] caught up in their own you know they're
[1:22:22] all very majoring on on all the
[1:22:24] conspiracy theories and Trump this and
[1:22:26] everything there and I get videos from
[1:22:28] all of them and I just don't watch it
[1:22:30] all because it just gets a bit
[1:22:31] monotonous but they are truly preparing
[1:22:34] for that and they will give their life
[1:22:36] for that and they will appear before the
[1:22:38] great white Throne judgment on the wrong
[1:22:39] side of the bar and we will be there on
[1:22:42] this side of the bar and they will give
[1:22:43] an account for when you witness to them
[1:22:46] when you shared the message to them when
[1:22:48] you gave them Front Page News

[1:23:08] righteousness she was like Esther she

[1:23:19] all of a sudden within her was to be
[1:23:20] Queen
[1:23:21] and who was to be have a have half of
[1:23:24] the Kingdom have a sector extended
[1:23:26] towards her to stand there and challenge
[1:23:28] the very Devil Himself and bring him to
[1:23:30] his demise and to come under the very
[1:23:33] leadership of a Nation

[1:24:37] I'm getting something now for the young
[1:24:39] people
[1:24:39] and I said this in Africa but it just
[1:24:41] comes in I've got to say
[1:24:43] there are
[1:24:45] five-year-olds that are going to be in a
[1:24:47] rapture
[1:24:49] there are 10 year olds that are going to
[1:24:50] be in the rapture
[1:24:52] there are all of these different ages
[1:24:54] right
[1:24:55] now you children
[1:24:56] are a witness
[1:24:58] and some of your friends that you'll be
[1:25:00] in connecting with are going to go on
[1:25:02] the rapture and you're the ones that are
[1:25:04] going to speak to them about this
[1:25:05] message you're the ones that's going to
[1:25:07] tell them the coming of the Lord is at
[1:25:09] hand and it might not just be by your
[1:25:10] mouth it'll be by your life that's why
[1:25:13] when you go out into the school when you
[1:25:16] go out into the world
[1:25:17] do not do what they do
[1:25:20] don't so easily compromise and become a
[1:25:23] movie lover and a and a lover of sin
[1:25:26] just to be cool with those cool girls
[1:25:28] that are all pretty and nice and they
[1:25:29] can do anything they want whether
[1:25:31] they're denominational whether they're
[1:25:32] in the world
[1:25:34] estas
[1:25:35] look young you know whatever some of
[1:25:38] your friends may be the ones that the
[1:25:40] Lord wants to change and they'll be ten
[1:25:42] when they get changed they'll be 12 when
[1:25:44] they get changed they'll be 15 when they
[1:25:46] get changed so you teenagers
[1:25:48] you're not too young to be a witness
[1:25:51] so wherever you're at be a real man
[1:25:54] be a real lady
[1:25:56] be a real witness and don't be ashamed
[1:25:59] because what you have can take them from
[1:26:02] Hell To Heaven
[1:26:03] just think about it I pray Lord and I
[1:26:06] want you to pray this Lord help me to be
[1:26:08] that witness help me to see that burden
[1:26:11] help me to be connected to the heart of
[1:26:13] God for these things because if you're
[1:26:15] not then what you're doing you try and
[1:26:17] you hear these things and then you go to
[1:26:18] school in the first while it's all right
[1:26:19] but then you just forget about it but if
[1:26:21] God reveals it to you and he reveals the
[1:26:24] the glory that's inside you
[1:26:26] yeah and the and and the burden of his
[1:26:29] heart to see people redeemed and you
[1:26:31] know you begin to see Heavenly things
[1:26:33] and you begin to feel his spirit in your
[1:26:35] life because you're not willing to
[1:26:37] compromise
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:42] there are young people that are going to
[1:26:43] get changed Hallelujah and I know you
[1:26:46] know and they've got to come in
[1:26:48] so let's go witness let's go tell amen
[1:26:51] the world Hallelujah
[1:26:55] God will lead you you know we're in an
[1:26:56] age where it's so thinning out
[1:27:01] who believes it's thinning out
[1:27:03] you know like the the the numbers and
[1:27:06] the masses it's not masses it's here and
[1:27:09] here are little ones here and there but
[1:27:11] there's still ones out there
[1:27:13] and if you pray
[1:27:15] you know when we when we were early on
[1:27:17] and we were still having prayer meetings
[1:27:18] at brother Ben's place
[1:27:20] we started praying Lord lead us to the
[1:27:22] elect seed and he did
[1:27:25] he did right
[1:27:27] he led us to all of a sudden Divine
[1:27:30] appointments started happening and I
[1:27:31] just pray if we can revive that prayer
[1:27:34] I just want you to pray that like in
[1:27:35] your in your house and in prayer meeting
[1:27:37] Lord lead us to your children
[1:27:40] because you know this is this is the age
[1:27:42] where you need that kind of this
[1:27:43] specific Divine appointments we're in
[1:27:45] Auckland we're down in Dunedin and we're
[1:27:47] in different places and and God can
[1:27:49] actually if you're willing to do
[1:27:51] something for him he'll put people
[1:27:52] around you and you they will always be
[1:27:55] accredited to your witness for eternity
[1:27:58] there'll be a special connection between
[1:28:00] you and those people that you witnessed
[1:28:02] to because you weren't ashamed and you
[1:28:05] know what shame comes from fear fear of
[1:28:07] rejection but look the Lord is here to
[1:28:09] heal that
[1:28:10] if anyone wants to be healed from fear
[1:28:11] of rejection he's here to do that
[1:28:14] and that's the very thing that stops us
[1:28:16] from witnessing to people that or the
[1:28:18] fear of upsetting people you know
[1:28:21] because you taught in this country I
[1:28:22] mean in Africa you can talk to anyone
[1:28:24] about the Lord and they all love the
[1:28:25] Lord and everyone you know we were
[1:28:27] witnessing to everyone and they were all
[1:28:29] taken books and they were I mean brother
[1:28:31] Ben LED people to the Lord outside
[1:28:33] someone's house you know it was like Hey
[1:28:35] praise the Lord everywhere we win there
[1:28:37] was people asking a prayer I felt like
[1:28:39] man why can't New Zealand just be warm
[1:28:41] you know these people when I go out
[1:28:43] there you even start talking about the
[1:28:44] Lord and you know we were in places
[1:28:46] public areas and you're talking about
[1:28:47] the Lord and people give you dirty looks
[1:28:50] as if like you know this is a filthy
[1:28:52] thing this is ah
[1:28:54] this is New Zealand though you know the
[1:28:57] only new Zeals in the in the church
[1:28:58] hello who's got new Zeal
[1:29:01] Hallelujah we got new Zeal you know why
[1:29:05] because you got something to worship
[1:29:07] You've Got Something to Dance about
[1:29:08] Hallelujah
[1:29:11] how much time have I got I got six
[1:29:12] minutes
[1:29:14] okay
[1:29:16] so the Ark of the Lord right
[1:29:18] huh help me Lord this has got to be
[1:29:21] quick and I'm not going to preach anyway
[1:29:22] I'm just going to tell you Glory
[1:29:27] amen so the Ark of the Lord came down
[1:29:29] under Moses Ministry
[1:29:31] you know a prophet's Ministry he went he
[1:29:34] got taken in a vision he saw a heavenly
[1:29:35] vision of how The Mercy Seat was and the
[1:29:38] angels guarding The Mercy Seat but the
[1:29:40] key was in the middle was Christ
[1:29:42] the throne and he was standing there and
[1:29:44] and God said now build this and so Moses
[1:29:47] now and the ministry of bezeliel and a
[1:29:49] few others were anointed in their
[1:29:51] giftings it actually brought that
[1:29:52] heavenly vision down into the wilderness
[1:29:55] so it brought the presence of God and
[1:29:57] the in a symbol of Heaven down and a
[1:30:00] portion in God's anointed fire came down
[1:30:02] into the holy of holies in the
[1:30:04] wilderness
[1:30:05] we always think the Wilderness there's
[1:30:07] no God there and you're just out of his
[1:30:08] will you're not if you're in the
[1:30:10] wilderness you're still walking with God
[1:30:12] it's taking you through stuff but you're
[1:30:13] gonna come into the land
[1:30:15] you're coming into the land I said I
[1:30:17] wasn't going to preach but you don't
[1:30:19] ever think you know people say you're in
[1:30:21] the wilderness and I've said that
[1:30:22] earlier and some people might get
[1:30:23] offended ah you say I'm out of no God's
[1:30:26] there
[1:30:27] he's taking you there he said I took you
[1:30:29] out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings to myself
[1:30:32] not to The Emptiness but the emptiness
[1:30:36] in the desert places and the trials was
[1:30:37] to prove what's in you it's to bring you
[1:30:40] to a place where you say Lord I am
[1:30:41] nothing and I need you and I depend on
[1:30:44] you and I'm surrendering everything so
[1:30:46] you can live so that you can be the
[1:30:48] preeminent King in my life not me I
[1:30:51] can't do it you can't do it none of us
[1:30:53] can the Wilderness is for a reason it's
[1:30:56] so that you can give up on yourself and
[1:30:59] let God come in don't give up and do
[1:31:01] nothing give up on yourself so God can
[1:31:04] come in
[1:31:05] Everything Changes then but let's say
[1:31:08] now this art comes down into the
[1:31:10] Wilderness and they have it in the holy
[1:31:11] of holies they're in the tense of
[1:31:13] congregation right Tabernacle the outer
[1:31:16] Court the inner Court in the holy of
[1:31:19] holies Body Spirit Soul rights and
[1:31:21] intent and it's moving through the
[1:31:23] wilderness
[1:31:24] the ark is a type of the seventh seal
[1:31:27] which is bringing Christ to the Earth so
[1:31:28] a portion of God's revelation in heaven
[1:31:31] was on Earth and it now every time the
[1:31:33] pillar of fire moved and the cloud moved
[1:31:35] they moved with it they as I said I've
[1:31:37] preached it already they came up to the
[1:31:39] Jordan and the whole church you could
[1:31:42] say was with them under the prophets
[1:31:44] Ministry a lot of them said let us turn
[1:31:46] back to Egypt here many times but there
[1:31:47] was a true elect and they came under the
[1:31:49] prophets Ministry the ark came the
[1:31:52] seventh seal and it came up to the River
[1:31:54] Jordan it stopped the flow and they went
[1:31:56] across right
[1:31:58] now the ark's still there for some
[1:31:59] people
[1:32:00] and it's waiting for you to come across
[1:32:02] he's waiting for you to die to yourself
[1:32:04] he's waiting for you to surrender your
[1:32:06] life he's waiting for you to die to all
[1:32:07] that you think you are so that he can
[1:32:09] reveal who you really are and come into
[1:32:12] the land now Israel crossed over Jordan
[1:32:14] the captain came down but the ark
[1:32:17] seventh seal the very presence of God
[1:32:20] was put in Shiloh
[1:32:22] stayed in Charlotte for a long time four
[1:32:24] or five hundred years
[1:32:26] Silo is tranquil silence
[1:32:29] so here is that great seventh seal
[1:32:31] coming down and it gets placed in
[1:32:33] silence and it sits there at the back
[1:32:36] not in Jerusalem where it should be
[1:32:38] right it should be in the heart or it
[1:32:40] should be right where it's all happening
[1:32:41] right in the center where God should be
[1:32:43] on the throne but it's actually in
[1:32:45] Shiloh right now that's Israel and they
[1:32:48] come and the Ark stays there and then
[1:32:50] Joshua's Ministry and they do great
[1:32:51] things and God fulfills his word he
[1:32:53] promises all these things right and he
[1:32:55] does it and it says it says all that was
[1:32:57] promised Moses and all that was said
[1:32:59] under Joshua the Lord has given all is
[1:33:02] theirs all is fulfilled
[1:33:05] right
[1:33:06] and those that really believe that like
[1:33:08] Caleb he said give me my mountain and he
[1:33:10] got his mountain and there was others
[1:33:12] that didn't get theirs and they cried
[1:33:14] and whatever and they get all what their
[1:33:15] things right but Caleb got it it's an
[1:33:18] individual thing even though it was like
[1:33:19] a national thing it was still individual
[1:33:22] those people Dan and all this occur and
[1:33:25] all those tribes they had families in
[1:33:27] those tribes it was those families that
[1:33:29] needed to claim their land find your
[1:33:31] redempt find your scriptures find your
[1:33:34] inheritance and claim it
[1:33:36] don't rely on us
[1:33:38] there's no point having a collective
[1:33:40] idea we're all going to have a Revival
[1:33:41] you need a Revival you need to claim
[1:33:44] your scriptures you need to get your
[1:33:46] land because when you get your land you
[1:33:48] can grow stuff
[1:33:49] you know that when you get your land
[1:33:51] there's fruit
[1:33:53] when you get your land your children
[1:33:55] getting saved your children are getting
[1:33:57] all those things because they're getting
[1:33:58] their land because now you can pass the
[1:34:00] inheritance down
[1:34:01] through the father's name right it's all
[1:34:03] the anointing of God when you claim it
[1:34:05] don't wait for the church
[1:34:07] because you'll be waiting forever
[1:34:09] it's you right Caleb was him said yes
[1:34:12] I'm taking my land so he took his land
[1:34:14] right now I just wanted to say that but
[1:34:16] so they went through but Joshua died off
[1:34:18] the generations so they went into sin
[1:34:20] the people of the message right
[1:34:22] people of the message they had a
[1:34:23] prophet's message they went into the
[1:34:25] time of judges and it was real bad
[1:34:27] eighth angels all these different
[1:34:30] Prophets
[1:34:32] two souls in the Millennium already you
[1:34:35] name it you know and then fighting
[1:34:38] Politics the Books open the books closed
[1:34:41] everything's everywhere no real headship
[1:34:43] but yet there was a roof yet there was
[1:34:46] Revival yet there was the seed and I
[1:34:48] believe I'm looking at people that are
[1:34:50] of that caliber that have taken it
[1:34:51] through right and then it came to the
[1:34:53] end you know and the ark's still in
[1:34:55] Shiloh still in Silence the seventh seal
[1:34:57] that was to bring the people to speak
[1:34:59] bit like Joshua he spoke the prophet he
[1:35:02] spoke in sunsood story controlled nature
[1:35:05] spoke storm be gone and sunshine for
[1:35:08] four days squirrel you come from there
[1:35:10] you come from there right that Ministry
[1:35:12] had that spoken word but it's like but
[1:35:15] when he was gone Joshua was gone late in
[1:35:18] silence then all of a sudden here comes
[1:35:20] the time of judges and sin the devil
[1:35:22] starts to try and destroy the message
[1:35:23] and as we know if you've been around
[1:35:25] long enough you've seen the history
[1:35:28] but Hannah Rises up God chooses Hannah
[1:35:31] she doesn't really know how major her
[1:35:33] thing is right she doesn't know how
[1:35:35] major her calling really is in this
[1:35:38] woman 60 odd years old Baron
[1:35:41] tortured in Her Mind by panina all those
[1:35:43] years created a pearl in her life
[1:35:46] penina means Pearl and a pearl formed in
[1:35:48] her life
[1:35:49] and
[1:35:51] she raises up with faith and a
[1:35:52] desperation I must bring forth life life
[1:35:55] comes forth from Hannah and that life
[1:35:57] was a prophet the prophet said because
[1:35:59] she was unselfish God gave a prophet and
[1:36:01] it was that prophetic Ministry that
[1:36:03] began Revival in the whole nation so a
[1:36:06] woman and I tell you now Hennis I know
[1:36:09] henna's here but there's ant Hannah but
[1:36:10] there's real we're all Hannah's amen
[1:36:12] where we have been sick and tired of
[1:36:14] politics we've been sick and tired of
[1:36:16] the past and all this headless chickens
[1:36:18] I shouldn't say that but like just that
[1:36:21] whole political realm right and all the
[1:36:23] stuff and doctrines and this isn't
[1:36:25] fulfilled in there no it's an event not
[1:36:27] a Doctrine right and Hannah realize it's
[1:36:29] an event life is coming forth and that
[1:36:31] life brought forth for David right and
[1:36:33] David now and this is David is a type of
[1:36:35] Christ in you
[1:36:37] Christ in you because David was a human
[1:36:39] being and yet he was the type of Christ
[1:36:41] and when Christ is in you you still make
[1:36:43] some mistakes but Christ is in you it's
[1:36:45] the hope of glory and and and when you
[1:36:48] anoint him King when life when you're
[1:36:50] falling or do not falling when you've
[1:36:52] shunned all the past and all the
[1:36:54] politics and all the he said she said
[1:36:57] trying to be the best trying to be the
[1:36:59] best girl trying to be the best boy
[1:37:00] trying to be the toughest or the
[1:37:02] strongest or the nicest or the coolest
[1:37:04] and all those emulations and all that
[1:37:05] competition's gone and all the politics
[1:37:07] is gone and all you care about is him
[1:37:09] and all you want to do is exalt his name
[1:37:11] and and and and the love of God right
[1:37:14] amen and you want life to come for
[1:37:15] that's the life
[1:37:18] that's the life
[1:37:20] that anoints him can
[1:37:22] not I try to be this I am Prius proper I
[1:37:26] know everything in the message I am the
[1:37:28] best
[1:37:30] those days is finished that's time a
[1:37:32] judge's days
[1:37:33] it's time to judge's time if you want
[1:37:35] David King forsake those things and let
[1:37:38] him rise because David was the very time
[1:37:41] that they got all their inheritance
[1:37:43] it was under David's Ministry that all
[1:37:45] the inheritance came to Israel
[1:37:47] now the Philistines really got beat
[1:37:49] and the malachite's really got beat
[1:37:51] everything really got beat
[1:37:53] hey
[1:37:55] it actually was total Deliverance under
[1:37:57] David right and that's the same thing
[1:37:59] all in your land because the kingdom of
[1:38:00] God is within you and if you want real
[1:38:02] total Deliverance they totally all of
[1:38:05] everything out and you want to get all
[1:38:07] of what's belongs to you that's already
[1:38:08] in you unlocked get all the squatters of
[1:38:11] of of malice out of you and the
[1:38:13] squatters of of unforgiveness out of you
[1:38:16] and the splatters of racistness out of
[1:38:17] you in the in the squatters of whatever
[1:38:19] it is right you know what's going on in
[1:38:22] your own life lust fear all those things
[1:38:24] if you want them out then let your life
[1:38:26] anoint David King you've had it here
[1:38:29] guys told you what your what the life is
[1:38:30] now it's time for you to recognize that
[1:38:32] you need it that's the Wilderness and
[1:38:34] you say Lord oh it is I'm done Lord here
[1:38:39] I am I nothing in my hands I bring
[1:38:42] simply to your cross I cling when all
[1:38:45] around my soldier's way he's All My Hope
[1:38:48] and stay and you know and he begins to
[1:38:50] come down into your life and change
[1:38:52] everything change your operating system
[1:38:55] change it from dos 3.1 to whatever the
[1:38:58] new one is
[1:38:59] hallelujah you know it's real hard doing
[1:39:02] anything on those old operating systems
[1:39:03] and that's like what you were before the
[1:39:05] New Birth oh my all these things to try
[1:39:08] and get one thing to work and it didn't
[1:39:09] work and then you put that disc in that
[1:39:11] didn't work and yeah and you just forget
[1:39:13] it
[1:39:14] oh my I don't know if anyone's been
[1:39:16] through that but I remember the 90s and
[1:39:19] computers was just a stressful thing
[1:39:21] that's what our old life is that's what
[1:39:24] the old nature is stressful always
[1:39:26] failing Saul could never truly deliver
[1:39:29] the people even though he was fighting
[1:39:31] all the time and you may be fighting all
[1:39:33] the time but the seven seal was in
[1:39:36] silence
[1:39:36] and that's the one that needs to come
[1:39:39] out of that position
[1:39:40] anyway David becomes king right and when
[1:39:43] David becomes king he finally brings the
[1:39:46] ark
[1:39:47] see that when I saw that I thought man
[1:39:50] what significance
[1:39:51] that in my own life
[1:39:53] when David is made King
[1:39:55] you know and David's exalted as king and
[1:39:57] he begins to deliver all these things
[1:39:59] into my hands and all my inheritance
[1:40:01] becomes a unlocked because remember when
[1:40:04] you've got the Holy Ghost everything is
[1:40:06] already in you all your inheritance is
[1:40:09] in you all the potentials is in you and
[1:40:12] you've just got to feed on the word and
[1:40:13] let them take out all those bitterness
[1:40:15] things take out all the pus all right
[1:40:19] but then it comes a time where David
[1:40:21] becomes king he's becomes preeminence
[1:40:23] because that was one of the great things
[1:40:25] that he desired under the threefold
[1:40:27] manifestation right was that he would
[1:40:30] reveal himself then he would have
[1:40:32] preeminence in his bride then he would
[1:40:34] take her the male and the female Back to
[1:40:36] Eden again and have a have a millennium
[1:40:38] that the devil interrupted
[1:40:40] so you know that right I'm talking
[1:40:42] higher level now but he so that
[1:40:45] preeminence in the bride starts with you
[1:40:48] you need to let them have preeminence in
[1:40:50] you
[1:40:51] now when David gets preeminence in you
[1:40:53] the first thing he's going to do is take
[1:40:56] the ark that was sitting in silence in
[1:40:58] your Shiloh and he's going to bring it
[1:41:00] out of silence and it's going to bring
[1:41:02] it into a into your heart and right into
[1:41:04] your very place of spoken word and you
[1:41:07] are going to begin to speak the word and
[1:41:09] life is going to come forth and you're
[1:41:10] going to get control over nature
[1:41:13] you're going to get control over all the
[1:41:15] elements of the Earth
[1:41:16] But first you need an anoint him King so
[1:41:19] that he can give you dominion over the
[1:41:20] elements of this first flesh because
[1:41:22] this flesh if you let it rule it says in
[1:41:25] Romans 6 let not sin reign in your
[1:41:28] mortal body
[1:41:30] to obey it in the lust thereof because
[1:41:32] if you do and you're still struggling
[1:41:34] with that
[1:41:35] then how can he give you creative power
[1:41:37] unlock it in your life
[1:41:39] if then you unlock it you'll be like the
[1:41:41] prophet Elias Elisha who cursed those
[1:41:44] beers curse those children they all died
[1:41:46] that he only had a portion of the
[1:41:48] creative power in him as a prophet God's
[1:41:51] giving you way more than that
[1:41:53] way more
[1:41:55] like it's unlimited he's not giving you
[1:41:58] less than what he's got
[1:41:59] because you're his wife right on top of
[1:42:01] the Kingdom the sentence extended
[1:42:02] everything's open right
[1:42:04] so now when he can see that you've got
[1:42:06] dominion over the elements what he has
[1:42:08] in you then he'll call the spoken word
[1:42:11] out of Silence now when David saw that
[1:42:15] happening you know
[1:42:17] he was dancing and shouting and he was
[1:42:21] so happy
[1:42:22] why was he so happy because he saw more
[1:42:25] than the others saw he saw more than
[1:42:27] McCall saw he saw more than Joe absor he
[1:42:30] saw more than his son saw he saw more
[1:42:33] and I believe that as that Ark was
[1:42:35] coming up he was dancing and leaping it
[1:42:38] said and amen and McCall was looking at
[1:42:40] him and despising him don't let McCall
[1:42:43] pull you down from worship
[1:42:46] don't let macaw
[1:42:48] look through your windows
[1:42:51] right now
[1:42:53] looking through just stay still
[1:42:55] deceit let's be nice and calm you're
[1:42:57] European you know we don't get too
[1:42:59] excited here we don't dance we don't
[1:43:02] leap even though the coming of the Lord
[1:43:04] is in my heart I'm just going to sit
[1:43:06] down
[1:43:08] amen
[1:43:10] did anyone see
[1:43:14] no you should be dancing and shouting
[1:43:16] Hallelujah yeah Glory
[1:43:20] I'm dancing and you know David had a
[1:43:22] secret weapon when he got in trouble you
[1:43:24] look every Psalm came from trouble why
[1:43:26] because he he realized something he had
[1:43:28] a secret weapon and I want to just arm
[1:43:31] you you're dangerous now you've got a
[1:43:32] secret weapon when all the trouble comes
[1:43:35] on you I want you to recognize inside me
[1:43:38] is the coming of the Lord and I'm gonna
[1:43:41] dance and I'm gonna encourage myself in
[1:43:43] the Lord when it's hard when I'm going
[1:43:46] through trials when I'm on the ground
[1:43:47] under failure when I make mistakes when
[1:43:50] everyone's against me when I've lost
[1:43:51] everything
[1:43:53] we all go through these things right
[1:43:56] hey man let's hit the musicians
[1:43:58] we all go through it
[1:44:00] but amen
[1:44:01] when you go through it remember you're
[1:44:04] armed and dangerous
[1:44:05] because when you begin to encourage
[1:44:07] yourself in the Lord
[1:44:09] when you begin
[1:44:10] to encourage yourself in the Lord
[1:44:12] then it all changes
[1:44:15] then you encourage yourself in the Lord
[1:44:17] begin to dance
[1:44:18] you might not want to dance in front of
[1:44:20] other people you might not dance very
[1:44:21] good
[1:44:22] but sometimes you just gotta you know
[1:44:24] McCall said to David
[1:44:26] how great was the King today who
[1:44:29] shamelessly uncovered himself and I
[1:44:32] thought Glory let me
[1:44:35] unashamed to uncover Who I Really Am
[1:44:38] you know who I really am and who you
[1:44:40] really are
[1:44:41] you are sons of God that shouted
[1:44:43] together and sung for Joy before the
[1:44:46] world began
[1:44:47] who knows the story
[1:44:49] George God said to Job where were you
[1:44:51] and I when the sons of God shouted
[1:44:53] together and the morning star sang
[1:44:56] now if you they shouted right so if your
[1:45:00] origin is shouting then it's time to be
[1:45:04] unashamed to uncover who that really is
[1:45:06] and then you know when we say the seals
[1:45:09] are open it's not just him open it's you
[1:45:11] open and when the seals open in your
[1:45:13] life it reveals who you really are
[1:45:15] Debbie reveals Who You Are
[1:45:18] and it's a good thing
[1:45:19] and sometimes we're embarrassed about
[1:45:21] who we really are and we're only like
[1:45:22] that in front of our home and our
[1:45:24] parents right young people
[1:45:26] you show on something nice at school and
[1:45:28] you be real good in that church you're
[1:45:30] real good at that Homer
[1:45:31] you know like just be yourself
[1:45:34] and if you're ashamed of any part of you
[1:45:37] if you're open about it God will change
[1:45:39] that he will he's in the process of
[1:45:41] restoring our lives and changing us amen
[1:45:45] Hallelujah can I just sing the song all
[1:45:48] weekend I don't want to sing it by
[1:45:49] myself

[1:46:18] that are a bit mysterious for some but I
[1:46:20] believe it's personal
[1:46:21] and I hope it isn't still mysterious I
[1:46:23] hope and I believe I just trust the Lord
[1:46:26] that he will make it personal and it
[1:46:28] will become an experience not a teacher
