[1:32] Yeah.

[1:39] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[3:46] [Music]
[3:55] Praise the Lord. Good evening. Was my
[3:58] mic on before. James, you set me up,
[4:03] [Music]
[4:05] bro. Did you hear what we were talking
[4:07] about?
[4:09] It was um I I read a book when I was
[4:13] young and it was talking about how to
[4:15] sort of form relationships and and one
[4:20] of the
[4:22] um points that this book made was
[4:26] that everybody has a favorite
[4:29] subject.
[4:31] Everybody. And if they're honest with
[4:33] themselves, their favorite subject is
[4:34] themselves.
[4:36] [Music]
[4:39] and and so then if you ask people about
[4:41] themselves, they want to talk to you
[4:42] because they're interested in
[4:43] themselves, you know, it's a it's a good
[4:46] way to start conversation if you ask
[4:49] questions. So I just started I used to
[4:51] so I started asking a lot of questions
[4:53] based on that bit of information that I
[4:56] read. But over time, as I became more of
[4:59] a Christian, I actually genuinely like
[5:00] to ask people about themselves because I
[5:02] love people and I like to find out how
[5:04] they are and how you're doing and what
[5:07] are you up to and
[5:08] that. So, I was just finding a wee bit
[5:11] out about James' day and his work and
[5:14] but are you going to be going away a bit
[5:16] now, bro, or you going to work here or
[5:17] go to Christ Church and
[5:21] Fangui? You're not not go away too much,
[5:23] eh? Thank you.
[5:28] No, praise the Lord. It's good. Yes. Um,
[5:31] let's um let's stand this evening. It's
[5:33] good to be here. How you doing? You
[5:34] ready to ready to worship the Lord? You
[5:36] had a good week. You're all victorious.
[5:38] You're just living in complete victory
[5:39] every single day. Not a not a care in
[5:42] the world,
[5:44] sun's shining, birds are chirping,
[5:49] drinking at the springs of living water.
[5:52] You're victorious in every situation.

[24:39] us. Yeah. So I want to greet you tonight
[24:42] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[24:45] And I want to thank brother Isaac. I
[24:47] don't I don't know brother Isaac how he
[24:50] manages
[24:51] to to get the songs that I
[24:55] like. I don't know. But uh I think he he
[25:00] makes some research and checks who likes
[25:02] which song which because because I just
[25:04] find that he just bring the songs that I
[25:06] like. Thank you my brother and thank you
[25:09] musicians. I think you can now take your
[25:12] your other rightful positions as we
[25:15] appreciate you very much. Sometimes uh
[25:17] we sing the songs
[25:19] and we just feel like we can just finish
[25:22] singing and go home
[25:25] because uh it it will be so good. Amen.
[25:30] And then while we standing, let's just
[25:32] read the word of God and then we can we
[25:35] can sit down. Thank you.
[25:39] musicians. We read we read in the book
[25:42] of
[25:47] Job.
[25:50] Sorry. Uh once you are there just say
[25:53] amen.
[25:56] Uh I I I brought my old friend today. Um
[26:00] it's not easy always. It's not easy to
[26:02] separate with your old Bible.
[26:05] Uh this Bible I love it very much
[26:08] because it has got so much memories
[26:12] uh in my life.
[26:15] Amen. And uh and by the way you see my
[26:18] Bible is like this here. It's got it
[26:21] shows me where the book is and
[26:23] everything. It was brother Sullie. It
[26:25] was sister Joen's father who made it for
[26:28] me. You see it's nice to have brothers
[26:30] and sisters. Brother Si made it for me.
[26:33] And I told the sister when she came, I
[26:35] said, "Sister, I didn't know you are his
[26:38] daughter, but it was him who made this
[26:40] for me." And then then this week I
[26:43] started to buy some. Last week I started
[26:45] to buy cream. I never drink coffee with
[26:47] cream. So I started to buy cream because
[26:50] I was thinking of brother Soul cuz every
[26:52] time I go to Voice of God Recordings,
[26:54] man, I miss that coffee he used to make
[26:56] me with
[26:58] cream. Sorry to put you on the spot, but
[27:01] I just miss my friend. Amen. So that was
[27:04] just to settle you up and uh
[27:07] smile. Job
[27:12] 38:4, excuse me. The Bible says, "Where
[27:15] was thou when I laid the foundations of
[27:19] the
[27:20] earth?" In plain English, it means where
[27:23] were you, Job? Amen.
[27:26] If thou has
[27:30] understanding, declare if thou has has
[27:33] understanding. In other words, tell me.
[27:35] God is not saying Job was not
[27:38] there. Just just underline that. Job God
[27:41] doesn't say Job was not there when he
[27:43] laid the foundation. He's just asking
[27:45] him if you have understanding right now
[27:48] with your cannal mind. If you can have
[27:51] and perceive, tell me Job if you
[27:53] understand, if you can remember. Then he
[27:56] says in verse five, who hath laid the
[28:01] measures thereof? If thou knowest, or
[28:05] who had stretched the line upon it,
[28:09] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[28:12] fastened, where where is it tied? You
[28:15] know when we do something even this
[28:18] stage we make sure that everything is
[28:20] tight is is strong. Do do you know where
[28:24] I've tightened the earth and fastened it
[28:27] and is strong and it can carry so many
[28:30] people so much weight so many things can
[28:32] happen on it. This do you
[28:35] know?
[28:37] Uh and who laid the cornerstone thereof?
[28:41] That's the part that I like. That
[28:43] cornerstone is Jesus Christ.
[28:45] So let's just pray together. If you've
[28:47] got a desire in your heart tonight, I
[28:50] have. Just lift up your heart or your
[28:52] hand. Heavenly
[28:54] Father,
[28:56] Lord, I'm just a man. Father, in fact,
[28:59] this is not even about me or my brothers
[29:02] and sisters. This is firstly about you,
[29:05] Lord. We are thankful that you brought
[29:07] us here tonight, Lord, to come and and
[29:11] be revived, Lord. To come and hear from
[29:14] you, the author and finisher of our
[29:16] faith, Lord, to come and be reassured,
[29:19] to come and fellowship with you on the
[29:21] table like me was called on the table of
[29:25] the king to come and dine. So we respond
[29:28] tonight to come. We come with all our
[29:31] hearts Lord and we ask Father that
[29:33] you'll forgive us as brother Ben always
[29:36] say Lord forgive us Lord even our secret
[29:38] sins Lord our mistakes we pray father
[29:41] God those ones that the enemy wants to
[29:44] accuse us and sneak them uh slightly be
[29:47] behind our back before you and report
[29:49] us. Forgive us also those ones Lord as
[29:52] we stand on this sacred place Lord we I
[29:55] pray for the hearer. I pray for the
[29:57] listener. I pray for the heart. I pray
[29:59] for even the lips that speaks here
[30:00] tonight. Circumcise my tongue, Lord, and
[30:03] my lips. Cut everything that is doesn't
[30:05] come from you and eradicate it, Lord,
[30:08] into a a sea of forgetfulness, Lord. And
[30:12] help us today to remember that the
[30:15] evidence is plenty, is endless. And we
[30:17] are so thankful for your blood. And we
[30:20] commit this service and the word that we
[30:21] have read into your hands in the name of
[30:23] our Lord Jesus Christ. and all we agree
[30:26] by saying amen. Amen. Please enjoy the
[30:29] comfort of your seats. I I I like to
[30:32] come and I like to come h once I
[30:36] prepared the sermon and I' I've prayed
[30:38] but just before I come I just want to
[30:40] say Lord just empty me now. Just just
[30:43] empty me. Let let me not even have the
[30:45] way I'm going to greet them the way I'm
[30:48] going to say what just empty me. Just
[30:50] just take that sermon and speak. Because
[30:53] if you I come here and memorize you know
[30:55] how I'm going to greet you that's just
[30:57] philosophy you know that's just
[31:00] recitation who knows
[31:01] recitation how many of you know
[31:04] recitation residas in
[31:08] Africans so I just say Lord empty me let
[31:12] me speak only from you so tonight
[31:14] tonight I want us to talk about a
[31:18] thought
[31:19] here called my foundation
[31:23] my
[31:25] foundation. And then the context that I
[31:28] would like to come up to bring before
[31:30] you is the one that says, "God and I
[31:33] together building me." God and I
[31:37] together building me. I was listening to
[31:39] a brother preaching. I I almost wanted
[31:41] to ask brother Ben, "Ah, Brut, can I
[31:44] just play the sermon for that brother
[31:46] and then we go home?"
[31:49] The Lord said, "No, you bring the
[31:51] thought. If there's someone inspired
[31:53] you, testify about it." The brother was
[31:56] talking
[31:57] about, you know, God and men in a
[32:00] partnership and talking about how how
[32:03] God actually needs
[32:05] you in this partnership. No wonder in
[32:09] the Bible he says you are the branches,
[32:13] huh? And there's fruits that will come
[32:15] from the branches. But I am the main.
[32:17] I'm the main. So the the branch needs
[32:20] the needs the stem and the stem needs
[32:22] the branch. And the the fruits cannot
[32:24] come if the branches don't do anything.
[32:26] So everything else needs everything in
[32:30] this. Even in the economy of God, you
[32:33] are so much part of God that God cannot
[32:37] finalize everything without you. That's
[32:38] right.
[32:39] That's how important that's how this
[32:41] partnership of you can you see how
[32:44] important you are. I don't mean you must
[32:47] be puffed
[32:48] up. You know there's the spirit of
[32:51] pompus
[32:52] pomposity. Brother Andy, we don't have
[32:54] these words
[32:56] anymore. You know when you feel pompous,
[32:59] I don't mean you must be that way. I'm
[33:01] just trying to show show you or share
[33:03] with you to realize that you are so
[33:06] important in the kingdom and economy of
[33:08] God that God cannot finish everything
[33:13] without you. If you are not there, all
[33:16] the plans of God cannot get in place if
[33:19] you are not there. Are we agree? Yes. So
[33:23] that is just a thought. Maybe you can go
[33:25] listen to that sermon. Brother Chad, I
[33:27] think he preached a few sermons about
[33:28] that one. Brother Chad Lamb, he blessed
[33:30] me so much. I wanted just to shake his
[33:33] hand, but it was unfortunately on
[33:36] YouTube. So my foundation, me po my
[33:41] foundation. If you feel tonight or maybe
[33:44] you just hear that this is so basic and
[33:48] fundamental, I just just just forgive
[33:50] me. Please just forgive me. But I
[33:53] believe that if you take you can take
[33:55] some something from the sermon. But
[33:58] tonight I just want to really speak to
[34:00] the young
[34:01] people. The young people. I really if
[34:05] today you pretend you don't know
[34:07] me. I'm a brother who come from
[34:10] somewhere but who loves you very much
[34:13] but who wants to speak to you for you to
[34:16] see
[34:17] this for you to understand this what we
[34:20] are going to talk about that uh there is
[34:23] a foundation that every believer every
[34:26] Christian has to be based on and has
[34:29] because you'll see now and and brother
[34:32] Ben I know brother I know there's many
[34:34] builders in here and correct me if you
[34:37] see me mis mis misappropriating or
[34:40] misquoting your profession brother just
[34:43] correct me and say no no no no that's
[34:44] not about building brother Paulo so but
[34:47] when I talk about really the foundation
[34:50] of a Christian person a believer a child
[34:53] of God what the what is the foundation
[34:55] what does it mean to you what is it
[34:57] right so I try there's so many pictures
[35:00] in this uh photo in this presentation
[35:02] because I'm talking to the young people
[35:04] and the young at heart right if even if
[35:07] you've got a foundation. But maybe God
[35:09] wants to fix something on your
[35:10] foundation. Yeah. You know, you know, is
[35:13] it true, brother Ben? A foundation can
[35:15] be fixed, right? It can be fixed, right?
[35:17] I remember I fixed my we fixed my
[35:20] mother's foundation. It was cracking.
[35:22] So, we fixed the house. You know, they
[35:24] dig the builders and they make sure the
[35:26] foundation is not strong and and when
[35:28] there's some shaking and everything, it
[35:30] settles properly. They can go under and
[35:33] and and and and correct the foundation.
[35:36] But it is so important the foundation
[35:39] that everything else that you can think
[35:42] about almost everything must have a
[35:45] foundation.
[35:47] You you'll be with me. Let's just read a
[35:49] few scriptures. That's it. And then we
[35:51] continue with our sermon and just relax.
[35:55] But you can tighten your seat belts. But
[35:57] just
[35:58] relax. Let's read John John 5.
[36:03] Search the scriptures, for in them ye
[36:06] think ye have eternal life, and they are
[36:10] they which testify of me. The scriptures
[36:14] search
[36:15] there. Yeah. Now you see now to search.
[36:19] H there's many ways you can search. Uh
[36:23] you can search to to find a fault for
[36:27] someone. You can search to find
[36:30] something that got lost that we have
[36:32] been looking for. You can search, you
[36:34] know, to learn. You can search and it's
[36:38] a way of investigation. So the but the
[36:40] search I'm talking about here is that
[36:43] engross yourself, immerse yourself in
[36:46] the word of God. Huh? Read the
[36:50] scriptures. Let your heart, your
[36:53] mind filter through.
[36:56] Don't don't read the scriptures like
[36:58] you're just reading a newspaper. There
[37:00] are times when you can just read passing
[37:02] through. But give yourself time to
[37:04] search the scriptures. Young people when
[37:07] I say there you finish off for me. Then
[37:09] you help me to preach. Right? Then I
[37:12] know ah my kids they with me right? I'll
[37:15] say it first then you can finish it off.
[37:16] When I say search the scriptures later
[37:18] on I say search there you see
[37:20] scriptures. That is your amen. Because I
[37:23] understand not all of you can say amen.
[37:25] like brother Andy. So just finish off
[37:27] with me, okay? I want you to enjoy the
[37:29] service, but I want you to take
[37:30] something home with you. Amen. So search
[37:34] the scriptures. Next, next scripture. 1
[37:37] Corinthians 3:10 to 10 to 40. According
[37:41] to the grace of God which is given unto
[37:43] me, me Paul talking as a wise master
[37:48] builder, I have laid the found
[37:52] the foundation. So Paul saying I have
[37:54] laid the foundation. Remember Paul was
[37:57] the first messenger that was sent to the
[37:59] Gentiles when the gospel moved from the
[38:02] from the Jews, right? And God create a
[38:04] space uh that will run for us. For us to
[38:08] be crafted in as the bride, the gentile
[38:12] bride like Esther. And for us to be
[38:15] crafted in, God had to close their eyes.
[38:19] And the first messenger when the door
[38:21] for the Gentiles opened was who? Paul.
[38:24] So he laid the foundation. So he says, I
[38:28] I was commanded to lay a foundation as a
[38:31] great master builder to lay it. Right?
[38:34] And then it says there and uh
[38:40] uh I have laid the foundation and
[38:43] another build there on. But let every
[38:45] man take heed how he buildeth upon. Be
[38:49] careful. That's why brother Brandham
[38:51] said me I preach what Paul preached.
[38:53] Amen. Yes sir. It must line up word upon
[38:56] word. Precept upon precept. No
[38:58] compromise. Doesn't matter who says
[39:00] what. Even if it's me more, you're dead.
[39:04] You find that I I am missing a precept
[39:06] upon what Paul says. You you are
[39:09] supposed to correct me according to the
[39:11] word and show me. That is why I want you
[39:14] to know and understand and have the
[39:16] proper foundation.
[39:18] Otherwise, you I'm going to lead you
[39:21] astray. Do you understand the importance
[39:23] of the foundation? You need to be able
[39:26] to say mama. But when I was reading the
[39:28] Bible, ah the Bible said this. Yeah.
[39:32] And mama says ah I'm aware you show her.
[39:35] You see here I was reading brother
[39:36] Brenam. I was reading here in his
[39:38] prayer. He said this this this about
[39:40] girls. So why why do you want why do you
[39:42] want me to do this mama? Okay, maybe I
[39:44] don't understand. You come with the
[39:45] right spirit then. But that's because
[39:48] your foundation is getting you strong,
[39:51] right? So you need to be able to get it
[39:54] for yourselves.
[39:56] Are you with me? Let's quickly
[39:59] jump. Okay, but let's read verse seven
[40:01] verse 11. For the for other foundation
[40:03] can no man lay
[40:06] that than that is laid. No other
[40:09] foundation. one foundation Paul has laid
[40:11] it as a as a master builder. Then we all
[40:13] follow that line. Are we together? Let's
[40:17] read Ephesians now.
[40:20] Therefore, ye are no more strangers and
[40:23] foreigners, but fellow citizens in the
[40:26] with the saints or and of the household
[40:30] of God. That's what I like very much to
[40:33] realize that I'm of the household of
[40:36] God. No one can take me out. No one can
[40:39] take you out. The Bible is confirming to
[40:42] you and are build. You see, you are you
[40:46] are part of this building. You are part
[40:49] of a building. We must understand that
[40:51] God's things works like this. In God,
[40:53] there's a pattern. Remember, brother
[40:55] Isaac preached about numbers. And then
[40:57] if you look at how the creation of God,
[40:59] you'll see there's many patterns. So the
[41:02] pattern here is that that I want to show
[41:05] you with you is that we are of the
[41:07] household of God. We are a building
[41:10] right? We are a building us as a church
[41:13] as the bride. But you yourself also you
[41:15] are a building as an individual. Ah so
[41:19] so the you you you resemble as a
[41:21] building. There must be a foundation in
[41:22] your life. But also we as a as a church
[41:25] here in Shakina we are a building. Not
[41:27] this one. We are a building. Right? And
[41:30] then there are some of us in the church
[41:32] who are maybe this carpet.
[41:35] Huh? Some of us are maybe maybe Isaac is
[41:39] the
[41:40] door. But the door is a lot. But maybe
[41:43] maybe Isaac is the window or maybe Arand
[41:46] is something you see. So but we are all
[41:49] maybe maybe you are just a little brick
[41:51] there on the
[41:53] corner. So we are a we are a building.
[41:56] Maybe you're just a mad there at the
[41:58] door like I would love to be. You know
[42:00] where everyone comes then you just wipe
[42:02] your feet. I would love to be that one.
[42:04] It's a nice position but the point I'm
[42:07] trying to say to you is that each one of
[42:09] you is part of this building. Right? And
[42:13] then at the same time you are a building
[42:17] yourself Josh as an individual as a
[42:19] person. Are we together? the the mystic
[42:22] body of Jesus Christ globally on earth
[42:26] we are rebuilding
[42:27] in this age the bride of God on the
[42:30] children of God from Paul until now we
[42:32] are we are forming a building also can
[42:35] you see the pattern the pattern I'm
[42:36] trying to show you follow me young
[42:38] people don't sleep remember this is for
[42:40] you if no one can hear me tonight please
[42:43] hear me Rebecca otherwise I'll keep on
[42:46] calling you
[42:48] Mary right let's read verse Verse 20.
[42:52] Yeah. I built upon the foundation of the
[42:55] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[42:58] himself being the chief cornerstone. Can
[43:01] you see that cornerstone I was talking
[43:03] about? He is the cornerstone of this
[43:05] building.
[43:07] Now let's come back to our lesson or our
[43:10] sermon. What what exactly is a
[43:13] foundation? Maybe we can give brother
[43:15] Ben a mic. He can tell you what a
[43:17] foundation is. But according to Google
[43:20] or you know is part of a structural
[43:23] system that supports and anchors the
[43:26] super structure of a building and
[43:30] transmits its load directly to the
[43:34] earth. It's it's loaded. Can you see? So
[43:37] a foundation takes the weight of the
[43:40] building and puts it into the earth so
[43:43] that the building can be stable. Right?
[43:47] So a foundation can be wide. H it can be
[43:51] wide. It can be deep. Hey brother Ben,
[43:55] it can be deep and it can be thick. Some
[43:58] of them
[44:00] and a foundation can be elevated. Maybe
[44:03] we can elevate and then because now we
[44:04] are building in a in a way. So we make a
[44:06] foundation and just elevate it you know
[44:09] and a house is built on this thing but
[44:11] but the house is there but the
[44:13] foundation is just trying to elevate the
[44:14] structure. So a foundation sounds like
[44:17] to me is such a powerful thing.
[44:21] I am not saying it is the only thing
[44:24] that is important in a building. But I'm
[44:26] saying it looks to me that from where
[44:30] the author or the designer of the house
[44:34] thinks remember everything start in the
[44:36] mind. In God's mind God laid you and
[44:41] created and had you and thought about
[44:43] you. Don't you know that the Bible says
[44:45] before the
[44:47] foundation God knew you? Because even
[44:52] the foundation that you see brother Ben
[44:53] and brother Ed and brother Arman
[44:55] building even that one you must know
[44:57] that it was in someone else's mind
[44:59] first. Am I right? So it start in the
[45:03] mind but it must materialize and we make
[45:07] a foundation. Now for real, we buy
[45:09] material, we make the foundation for
[45:11] this house. But it started here, right?
[45:14] So what do you see as the foundation
[45:17] started in somebody else's mind? What do
[45:19] you see here today? If you look around
[45:21] you, you are seeing things that started
[45:24] in God's mind before the
[45:27] foundation of the earth.
[45:30] So don't look at yourself and say me.
[45:33] No, before there was a foundation,
[45:36] before God laid the foundation, he says,
[45:39] "Job, where were you when the sons of of
[45:41] God?" But then I thought that was the
[45:43] beginning when he added the foundation.
[45:44] No, they were there before the
[45:46] foundation. So there's things that were
[45:48] there after the foundation and there's
[45:50] things that were there before the
[45:51] foundation. One of those things is you.
[45:54] That's right.
[45:56] So what God is trying to do here or what
[45:58] we are trying to do here when you hear
[46:00] us saying young people young people this
[46:02] this this this Debie is because we're
[46:05] trying to show you to help you where God
[46:08] is trying to take you back to your
[46:09] original where you were before. You see
[46:13] just once you get the foundation right
[46:15] that building will be exactly how God
[46:17] saw it at the
[46:18] beginning. That's then you go home done.
[46:23] So let's jump to the next slide. Still
[46:26] want to learn a little bit about this
[46:27] foundation. There are things that are
[46:29] similar. You can have so many
[46:31] foundations for different buildings, for
[46:33] different structures, for different
[46:35] things. But there are some similarities
[46:37] in in building. You know it they say
[46:40] transfer the load. It is a it must have
[46:42] a bearing capacity capacity of the soil
[46:45] or the rock beneath them. A foundation.
[46:48] If if it gets built on a wrong
[46:51] soil, it might be what will happen,
[46:54] brother
[46:55] B? It will sink. You hear that? It will
[46:59] sink. Every things, worldly things that
[47:02] we see must teach
[47:05] us. You'll see what I'm saying, what I'm
[47:08] talking about. Just think about
[47:09] yourself. The brother says if the
[47:11] foundation is wrong or is built on poor
[47:14] soil, it may sink. It will sink. So you
[47:18] need to make sure that your foundation
[47:20] lily the soil
[47:25] is foundations provide
[47:28] stability. Actually foundations the way
[47:30] we you guys make them brother Ben you
[47:32] actually make them to last. You make
[47:35] foundations to
[47:36] last. Actually they make foundations to
[47:39] be forever but you know that here on
[47:41] earth nothing will be forever. Only one
[47:44] foundation can be forever. So they are
[47:47] trying to make a foundation to last
[47:49] forever. The the mere thing that is a
[47:51] foundation is meant to to last forever.
[47:55] That is why it must be right. It must be
[47:58] correct in accordance.
[48:02] Yeah. They made to last forever that I
[48:04] wrote. So we reinforce them with the
[48:07] concrete with
[48:08] the material like steel, mercenary
[48:12] timber. We bring all sorts of m
[48:14] according to how the soil is, according
[48:16] to the designer, according to the
[48:18] measurements and the the things that we
[48:20] must bring to make this foundation. So
[48:22] it must fit certain standards and
[48:24] requirements and it will it must pass.
[48:27] Am I right? The inspector must come and
[48:28] say yeah Bailey Bailey bills this is
[48:31] good. I'm happy. Right? And put a stamp
[48:36] then my brother get paid. You see? So
[48:38] that's how it works.
[48:41] So, it's a beautiful thing, a
[48:42] foundation, but it must be done right.
[48:46] Let's move on. Oh, yes, it must be
[48:48] customized to the side. It must be
[48:50] customized. You can't just make a
[48:52] foundation anyhow. Otherwise, you're
[48:54] going to find that, oh, the door was
[48:56] supposed to be and you find that that
[48:57] door now is have to be this side because
[48:59] the foundation was done wrong. It was
[49:01] not done properly.
[49:04] So we don't want it must be customized
[49:06] according to the plan according to the
[49:08] building according to how this was
[49:10] planned to be. I cannot expect you to
[49:13] build like how Martin Luther built
[49:15] Martin Luther at his age. You'll see now
[49:17] as we go along what I'm talking about.
[49:19] Let's quickly move on. So I want to show
[49:21] you pictures now. I hope others will
[49:24] enjoy
[49:25] them. 10 slides are are pictures. So out
[49:29] of 28 10 minus
[49:33] We have already done already. We have
[49:35] already done a
[49:36] few. So look at this. Look at this type
[49:39] of a of a that made me to think of a
[49:42] foundation. Look at this tree. Just look
[49:44] at it. Why wh why why why must that tree
[49:48] have such roots that starts even from
[49:50] outside and spread? Why? It must be
[49:53] customized the type of the tree that
[49:56] must grow because God knows that the
[49:58] type of the tree that must grow it's
[49:59] going to be heavy. It's going to be
[50:01] strong. That is why and not every tree
[50:04] grows anywhere
[50:06] in every soil. There's places where you
[50:08] certain trees you can't plant them
[50:11] because they cannot
[50:12] stand. But no, we human being we just
[50:15] take them. I just I just take a a tree
[50:18] from Australia and I take in South
[50:19] Africa and I I even give it a name. I
[50:22] says blue gum. I says blue gum. It won't
[50:25] last. No. Fall on the house
[50:30] because it's not meant to be there.
[50:33] Look at this tree.
[50:36] Does it Does it amazes you? Does it Does
[50:38] it do something in you? Just think about
[50:40] the foundation. How deep if the storm
[50:43] come and the wind and everything this
[50:44] tree will some trees man. I went up
[50:46] north. I found some trees that has been
[50:48] there for hundreds and hundreds and
[50:49] hundreds of years. They're not falling.
[50:53] Even if they're dead, they stand.
[50:58] Nothing shakes them because the
[51:00] foundation was made right.
[51:04] It stands. You can hit it. It just
[51:07] stands still because the foundation was
[51:08] right. Look at that. Think about the
[51:11] foundation. Look at this
[51:13] foundation. Look at this one. There's
[51:16] going to be a beautiful five-
[51:17] bedroomedroom house there that can fit
[51:18] my family. There.
[51:22] Look at that. Look at how they designed
[51:25] it. Look at how they make it nice and
[51:27] square. Look at how smooth. Look at how
[51:29] strengthened. And they made already
[51:31] electrical things that must come. Look
[51:33] at the design. Just Just look at that. A
[51:36] foundation and it is
[51:38] passed.
[51:40] Imagine if they missed something here on
[51:43] this
[51:44] corner and your bed is going to sit
[51:47] around there.
[51:49] What will happen if a little small
[51:51] earthquake
[51:52] come? You see, can you see why it's so
[51:55] important to have a foundation that is
[51:57] proper? And buildings are different. The
[52:00] foundations are different. Like I've
[52:02] said, some are like that depending on
[52:05] the type of a building, depending on the
[52:08] soil, depending on what all the
[52:10] requirements that are put a foundation
[52:12] you see. So I want you to understand the
[52:15] importance of a foundation.
[52:19] Are you hearing me? Young people, young
[52:21] people, are you hearing me? Are you with
[52:23] me? Malachi, you follow me, my boy. The
[52:25] importance of the
[52:28] founding. See some of them, maybe some
[52:31] of you are going to be engineers and
[52:32] design these foundations and build them
[52:35] and and and say, "Wow, brother used to
[52:37] talk about these foundations, man. It's
[52:39] so important this thing." Then you take
[52:41] it, apply it to your life and say,
[52:43] "Lord, if my foundation somewhere is fix
[52:46] it, my father and God fixes it for you."
[52:49] And because the devil wants our
[52:51] foundations to be skew, he wants our
[52:54] foundations not to be right. I used to
[52:56] like so much Voice of God. I don't know
[52:58] if they still have it. They had a
[52:59] program called Young
[53:01] Foundations. I just thought that is a
[53:03] powerful way name, Young Foundations.
[53:07] Look at these buildings.
[53:10] Look at them. All of them. They are
[53:13] sitting on a
[53:16] foundation. So foundations are holding
[53:18] the economies of this earth of this
[53:20] world. Foundations. Look at that. Some
[53:23] of them in Japan when an earthquake
[53:25] comes and shake them, they go like this.
[53:28] Understand?
[53:30] Why? Because there was a specialized
[53:32] foundation.
[53:35] It's not the only thing that is
[53:36] important. Remember that the whole
[53:38] building is important everything but the
[53:40] foundation is the beginning of bringing
[53:43] the
[53:45] thought. Are we together? We'll go
[53:48] faster with the pictures. But
[53:50] sometimes sometimes foundations go
[53:55] wrong. Am I right my brother? Please.
[53:58] Brother Ben knows sometimes foundations
[54:00] go wrong and something like this happen.
[54:06] We say, "Hey, this wall, let's just take
[54:09] poly, what do they call it? Polyfiller.
[54:12] Let's take polyfiller mixed with water
[54:13] and just put some." No, no, no, no,
[54:15] brother. This the foundation.
[54:18] It's not the
[54:19] wall. The wall is just showing you where
[54:23] that there's a problem down there.
[54:25] That's right. And that's where the
[54:28] builder can fix. Or rather, if you are
[54:32] like my brother, brother Ben, you say,
[54:33] "No, no, brother Paulo, let's destroy
[54:34] this thing. Let's put a press
[54:37] foundation. Fix this. Mr. Fix, isn't it?
[54:40] Fix this thing. Put a fresh foundation.
[54:42] A proper one. The Lord can do that
[54:46] because he doesn't want this. Look at
[54:48] this. Some of the
[54:50] foundations. Can you see? Look at that.
[54:54] As such a millions of RS put there, but
[54:56] the foundation was not put right. The
[54:59] inside, the interior was beautiful.
[55:02] Oh, the buildings double story, 10tory,
[55:06] everything was perfect. There were some
[55:07] automatic lights. The leaves were there.
[55:11] You know that tower there in France? Is
[55:12] it that one or there's another tower
[55:15] somewhere which is cute?
[55:19] Huh? Where is that? Yeah, in Italy. It's
[55:23] wrong. It's a wrong
[55:26] foundation. Look at that. Hey, Gab.
[55:29] Where is Gabby?
[55:31] Look at this. Look at this
[55:34] one. Look. You see? You see why? Why a
[55:38] foundation must be
[55:40] right. You see that, Gabby? Otherwise,
[55:43] your
[55:44] little our little house won't stand. And
[55:48] because Gabby rushed to put something
[55:50] there in between and forgot, oh, this
[55:53] thing must
[55:54] stand. Even this one must be right. Am I
[55:57] right, Katy? Katy, am I right? Am I
[56:00] right my girl? Amen. He
[56:03] agrees.
[56:05] Because at the end of the
[56:08] day, this is what the Lord wants. That
[56:11] is why we are having a proper
[56:12] foundation. That is why God wants to
[56:16] have a building that is proper, that is
[56:18] excellent, fit for royalty, fit for
[56:21] heaven. And he's going to make that
[56:24] house in you.
[56:26] Look at what they're doing.
[56:28] There is a reason why they are
[56:30] strengthening that
[56:32] foundation. They are realizing that this
[56:34] foundation must be strong. It must be
[56:36] strong. It must be it must pass all and
[56:39] stand. You know the scripture that the
[56:41] scripture that says a wise man build his
[56:44] house on a rock.
[56:46] That is why it's so good to be a
[56:48] believer. You just just get the
[56:50] inspiration when we have a song that
[56:52] says rock of rock of revelation. Man, it
[56:54] just it just make you cry. He just make
[56:56] you sit alone and close the closet and
[56:58] cry
[57:01] because you you you realize that God is
[57:04] actually life among us. I don't care
[57:08] what the devil can tell me. God is life.
[57:11] Amen. You know when when they when you
[57:13] pluck something there on the wall and
[57:15] there's some three things life and
[57:17] neutral and F. So life is life. If you
[57:22] put your finger there that thing is
[57:24] life. God is always life. So in our
[57:29] midst, he's so alive, so available, so
[57:32] present that he just all our gifts can
[57:36] be manifested here. We just have to
[57:39] submit. I'll show you what we can do for
[57:42] all our gifts to come and and for us to
[57:44] really be that building that God is
[57:48] wants to build in you. Let's move on
[57:51] quickly. I didn't put my watch because
[57:55] imagine if they cannot strengthen this
[57:57] building. What? Exactly what brother Ben
[58:00] said. If they cannot strengthen this
[58:02] this can you see that beautiful house
[58:05] and I think that area there they bride
[58:08] there they make
[58:10] bride and then imagine the man cutting
[58:14] the loan beautiful house
[58:18] millions but somebody must make the
[58:20] right foundation.
[58:22] You can build as much as nice. Put
[58:25] everything as if they cannot strengthen
[58:27] that foundation. Look at that man. Look
[58:30] at that one here. I someone why is he
[58:33] going so far? Everything must be
[58:35] according to the plan and the design for
[58:37] it to be a proper foundation.
[58:40] So don't be surprised when we ask you to
[58:42] do choruses to preach, when we say sing,
[58:45] when we say read your Bible, when we say
[58:47] no, you might not know. At the
[58:49] beginning, this house does not know what
[58:51] they are building. You say, "Wow, at the
[58:54] end, am I such a beautiful building?"
[58:57] But you didn't know when God was busy
[59:00] building you, cutting you and mold you,
[59:04] cut you, mold you. The cut of the Lord
[59:07] is not to hurt you, it's to mold you, to
[59:10] press you, and and and squeeze you. You
[59:14] know, just, you know, sometimes even
[59:16] when we renovate the houses, you'll
[59:18] think, "Ah, ah, they don't want it
[59:20] anymore.
[59:23] because they are remolding that house.
[59:26] Pray break here. If you went there at
[59:29] brother Ben's house today, I'm going to
[59:30] be on you, bro. If you went there to
[59:32] brother Ben's house, the first one when
[59:33] when we were renovating it, man, man,
[59:36] it's like you won't think people are
[59:38] going to stay there. Remove this one.
[59:40] Break this. No, he didn't even kick
[59:43] it. But he's
[59:45] fixing. See, do you remember that door?
[59:48] If you're kicking it like that, the door
[59:49] will say, "Do you like me?" Yes.
[59:52] Sandpaper it and scratch it and scratch
[59:55] it and repaint it. That's what God to us
[59:59] do to us for us to be like that. So
[1:00:03] let's flip the
[1:00:05] coin. We spoke about the natural
[1:00:08] foundations, the building. We have now
[1:00:10] seen the importance of a foundation. We
[1:00:13] understand that if a foundation is not
[1:00:15] right, something the winds can come, the
[1:00:18] storms can
[1:00:21] come and it will fall apart. It cannot
[1:00:24] stand the test of times. Right? Right.
[1:00:29] Now, so how many knows this
[1:00:32] one? Ah, you see. So, so this is this is
[1:00:37] another building. This is you.
[1:00:41] This is you.
[1:00:42] This is the stature of a perfect man.
[1:00:45] God wants to bring us into a stature
[1:00:49] into a building that is like that which
[1:00:52] the the foundation is faith.
[1:00:56] Let's go quickly. You know that one. Yes
[1:00:59] sir.
[1:01:01] So so I just put it together with that
[1:01:03] one just to to show the comparison for
[1:01:05] the young people to know that oh the
[1:01:07] building. Oh we are talking about that
[1:01:09] building. You see Paul started he was
[1:01:10] the first messenger. Paul and then
[1:01:13] virtue another smeirina church
[1:01:16] age smeirina doesn't it reminds you of
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:20] smeirnas smeirina church
[1:01:24] age pamos knowledge
[1:01:29] criteria all of them up to brotherly
[1:01:31] kindness that's a building and this
[1:01:34] thing the way it is I don't know they
[1:01:36] say a pyramid is one of the most safest
[1:01:40] structurally speaking
[1:01:42] that building that's why they are still
[1:01:44] sending there even the pyramids of Gaza
[1:01:46] today a great foundation has been laid
[1:01:48] there so and there's no cement
[1:01:55] there because it was already in the mind
[1:01:57] of God so you and me we have been built
[1:02:00] to be like this and the foundation at
[1:02:03] the bottom is what faith
[1:02:06] and you know brother teaches us that
[1:02:08] faith is a revelation faith is a
[1:02:11] revelation. So let's go on and see. Now
[1:02:15] you can see now why it's so important
[1:02:18] for a foundation of every believer to be
[1:02:21] strong to be appropriate, right? We see
[1:02:23] the need. How then how then do you do
[1:02:27] you get it right more? H how how then
[1:02:30] Jono do I brother Paulo tell me now I
[1:02:34] hear you the foundation is good is
[1:02:36] important my foundation and everything.
[1:02:38] How can I
[1:02:40] ensure that my foundation Liam is
[1:02:46] right? Is that the question, Mary? How
[1:02:49] can
[1:02:49] I? Let's let's go to the next slide.
[1:02:52] We'll read John
[1:02:54] 15. Abide in me and I in you. As a
[1:02:59] branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:03:01] itself,
[1:03:03] abiding in him, except it abide in the
[1:03:09] vine, no more can he, neither you. You
[1:03:12] cannot bear any fruits if you don't
[1:03:14] abide in him because you are a branch
[1:03:16] and you are going to bring fruits. But
[1:03:18] if you don't abide in
[1:03:20] him, verse seven, if you abide in me and
[1:03:23] my words abide in you, you shall ask
[1:03:26] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:03:29] you. If you
[1:03:31] abide, if you keep my commandments, you
[1:03:34] shall abide in my love, even as I have
[1:03:37] kept my father's commandments and abide
[1:03:40] in his love. Can you see there's a
[1:03:42] pattern? He's not telling you something
[1:03:44] that he didn't do. everything. There's a
[1:03:47] pattern. Do this because you you're
[1:03:49] copying me. Do this because I did this.
[1:03:52] Do do this because I did for my father.
[1:03:54] I Okay, verse 12. This is my commandment
[1:03:58] that you love one another as I love you.
[1:04:02] Why? Why? Why the Lord keeps on talking
[1:04:04] like the Lord wants to show you that
[1:04:06] it's possible. What I'm showing you is
[1:04:08] doable. It's achievable. You You can
[1:04:11] make it.
[1:04:14] Amen. You've got no choice because if he
[1:04:17] chose you, brother, sister, it's not
[1:04:19] your
[1:04:21] choice. Now, what is to
[1:04:25] abide? According to
[1:04:27] Google, to abide is to accept or act in
[1:04:32] accordance
[1:04:35] with. to act or to
[1:04:39] accept in accordance with maybe say a
[1:04:42] rule or a decision or a recommendation
[1:04:46] is to abide I even underline there you
[1:04:49] obey it's got it's got a strong elements
[1:04:52] of obedience
[1:04:53] inside you
[1:04:55] observe you observe all
[1:04:58] protocol you don't just rush and you are
[1:05:00] eating and then you just take a big
[1:05:01] piece and your father takes a small
[1:05:03] piece that's not protocol you allowed to
[1:05:06] take a big a big
[1:05:08] piece. That's
[1:05:10] protocol. Am I
[1:05:13] right? Sorry, I'm not setting new rules.
[1:05:16] In my in my protocol in my protocol at
[1:05:19] home, Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:05:20] Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:05:20] Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:05:20] Mo Mo Mo Mo knows which piece belongs to
[1:05:23] dad and he knows very well and and which
[1:05:27] piece he can associate with
[1:05:29] himself and which piece he can associate
[1:05:33] with his brother or sister. You know
[1:05:35] there there
[1:05:37] protocols and we even have protocols
[1:05:40] where we know that that chair there is
[1:05:42] for brother Matt and that is for Talia.
[1:05:45] There's those protocols. So we obser we
[1:05:47] observe those protocols. We abide by
[1:05:50] them. Am I right? So to abide the Lord
[1:05:54] says if you ab my words abide in
[1:05:58] you observe them you keep them you do
[1:06:01] them you hold on to
[1:06:04] them. Faith because because why? Because
[1:06:08] if you don't do that that means you're
[1:06:09] not hearing. How many of you read
[1:06:11] today's scripture that brother Ben sent?
[1:06:14] Young people. How many? I don't mean to
[1:06:16] expose you, but you see, you need to
[1:06:18] start somewhere. Yeah. For the fire to
[1:06:21] burn in my upbringing, we put the
[1:06:25] little soft flowers, I mean
[1:06:28] soft grass that is must be dry. We put
[1:06:32] some little status. We don't just take
[1:06:35] big blocks and and put them together and
[1:06:37] start the fire. No, no, no. That fire
[1:06:39] won't burn.
[1:06:40] Start small, but start. Yeah.
[1:06:50] Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the
[1:06:52] word of God. And man cannot live by
[1:06:55] bread
[1:06:56] alone. Men cannot live by pasta and rice
[1:07:00] and all these things and br alone. You
[1:07:03] will die even you will die healthy. Yes,
[1:07:06] brother Maka
[1:07:08] said you will die and and while doing
[1:07:11] keto sorry
[1:07:14] sorry I don't mean you but I mean we
[1:07:16] will die doing keto if we don't eat the
[1:07:19] word of God
[1:07:21] it doesn't matter what you eat you
[1:07:23] cannot live by bread alone because you
[1:07:25] are not only a physical being the spirit
[1:07:28] must eat that so if you stuff the
[1:07:32] spirit what do you mean what do you want
[1:07:35] the spirit to
[1:07:36] do because the spirit must eat and and
[1:07:40] if you eat the word not just read him
[1:07:41] halfhazardly you are abiding in him
[1:07:44] before you know it that fire is burning
[1:07:47] before you know it Liam then you put big
[1:07:49] blocks on you put the big ones like this
[1:07:53] guitar you bring you know that
[1:07:56] next you bring those big locks now the
[1:07:59] fire is burning now now nobody you are
[1:08:01] the one who wakes daddy and mama in the
[1:08:03] morning hey I wake up it's church day
[1:08:05] today and they don't go we are going to
[1:08:08] balls don't forget we are not going to
[1:08:10] lower our heart today because there's a
[1:08:12] fire burning in this guy this guy he
[1:08:14] read his Bible he tells his mother what
[1:08:17] what he saw what the prophet saying hey
[1:08:20] guys you must have your own foundations
[1:08:22] and make sure that that foundations is
[1:08:24] strong and the only thing that is going
[1:08:26] to to make it that way sister Debbie is
[1:08:28] this the word of God if you eat it
[1:08:33] even you adults let's not presume that
[1:08:35] we do it. This for the children to do
[1:08:38] it, the inspiration must start from us.
[1:08:41] The inspiration must must they must see
[1:08:43] it in us. Am I right,
[1:08:46] Sarah? And you must ask, "Mom, hey, did
[1:08:49] you read your Bible this week, Mom? I
[1:08:50] didn't see you. I know you're busy, but
[1:08:52] I didn't see you. I can read for you. I
[1:08:54] can read a few verses for you, Mom, for
[1:08:56] this. I didn't see you." You must bring
[1:08:59] us to task and let's make the message.
[1:09:01] Let's make it fashionable for ourselves.
[1:09:04] The word is not going to make it nice.
[1:09:06] They will keep on say making it boring
[1:09:08] and the word will make the message or
[1:09:10] the word of God look like boring. We are
[1:09:12] going to make it passionable, nice and
[1:09:15] enjoyable for our young people because
[1:09:17] after all it is brother Andy
[1:09:21] if you just see it in a different
[1:09:24] perspective. I'm going to finish. I'm
[1:09:26] changing my watch. Abide. I'm going to
[1:09:29] read for
[1:09:30] you few quotes and then we go
[1:09:34] home just to substantiate and and sort
[1:09:37] of uh share with you what blessed me
[1:09:39] when I was reading what brother
[1:09:44] Brandham said because you see it's not
[1:09:48] it's no use just to be a church member
[1:09:50] just to be a just to be part of no just
[1:09:54] to be a part of the group that's not
[1:09:56] going to help you my boys just to have
[1:09:57] friends just have good friends and
[1:09:59] wonderful beautiful friends. How is that
[1:10:02] going to help
[1:10:04] you? There this life in this life we
[1:10:07] we've got a purpose. Every part of this
[1:10:10] building must have a purpose. Every part
[1:10:13] of my body must serve its purpose.
[1:10:18] Otherwise, there's no use for you to be
[1:10:20] here in the body. You must find your
[1:10:23] purpose, your position. And even that
[1:10:26] only going to find that if you come
[1:10:28] through the plan of the
[1:10:31] foundation, the word of God. That's the
[1:10:35] only thing. If you neglect that one, I'm
[1:10:38] I'm not lying to you. You're going to
[1:10:40] say, "Yeah, that brother was right." You
[1:10:42] may not come and tell me. But Josh, the
[1:10:44] truth of the matter, my children, is
[1:10:48] there's no way that you can do it. We
[1:10:51] can have the best technology. We can
[1:10:52] have the best deacons, the best
[1:10:54] building, the best system, the best
[1:10:56] brothers with ties who love everybody
[1:10:59] and always smiling. We can have the best
[1:11:01] parents and everything. As long as we
[1:11:03] don't eat the word of God, we going
[1:11:06] nowhere. That's right.
[1:11:08] You hear me, Mike? You hearing me?
[1:11:12] Let's read here from the spoken
[1:11:14] fundamental foundation for faith and
[1:11:16] hear what the man of God says. Now the
[1:11:19] first thing before we can have faith
[1:11:21] we've got to have some foundation of
[1:11:25] faith there was there has got to be
[1:11:28] something behind it remember I told you
[1:11:31] that faith is a
[1:11:33] revelation you hear the word of God you
[1:11:36] hear the word of God you hear it after
[1:11:38] hearing it something comes up a
[1:11:41] foundation faith comes up out of what
[1:11:44] you heard so something emerge something
[1:11:47] emerges from there after you heard. Huh?
[1:11:50] It has to be based on something.
[1:11:54] You don't just love a girl and you want
[1:11:55] to marry her and this is baseless. You
[1:11:57] just think you love him. No, it must be
[1:12:00] based on something.
[1:12:04] But no, no, this was meant for the
[1:12:05] adults now.
[1:12:09] This was meant for the adults or the
[1:12:11] soon to be.
[1:12:16] Now something must be behind it by but
[1:12:20] faith comes by a settled something that
[1:12:23] is in the human heart that tells you and
[1:12:27] just as sure as you come to this church
[1:12:30] tonight it's not a guess work
[1:12:34] faith when I say where's where's
[1:12:37] Victoria when I say there's faith where
[1:12:39] there's sister faith I'm saying there
[1:12:41] she is I can see her and I can hold her
[1:12:43] hand and say here is faith Yeah, that's
[1:12:46] how real faith is. Faith. Real faith.
[1:12:49] The stacks are just trying to show us
[1:12:51] faith. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here, let's
[1:12:53] just bring it will bring your human
[1:12:54] faith there. Faith is like that. Faith.
[1:12:58] When you say faith, you mean faith.
[1:13:00] There's is faith. You can see her there.
[1:13:02] That's how faith faith to believe in God
[1:13:06] is. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:13:08] Faith is so real more than our own
[1:13:10] senses. I'm going ahead of myself. But
[1:13:12] faith that is why faith is there. Who
[1:13:15] can who faith? Raise your hand. Can you
[1:13:17] see my girl? There's faith. Can you see
[1:13:20] her? Can you see faith? This is faith.
[1:13:24] Now your faith is like that. Real like
[1:13:27] that. As as real as how you see her,
[1:13:30] that's how your faith is.
[1:13:32] Isn't that wonderful? So that's how
[1:13:35] faith
[1:13:37] is. Your faith.
[1:13:40] Code number two, it comes from, "Thy
[1:13:43] seed shall possess the gates of the of
[1:13:45] his enemy." I'll only read the yellow
[1:13:47] ones. You can go and read the
[1:13:49] rest. But
[1:13:52] listen, h what does he say? Oh. Oh, this
[1:13:55] is the part I like. I tell you, faith is
[1:13:57] a great Sorry, I'll read the white part
[1:13:58] also. Um, faith is is a great big thing
[1:14:02] when it comes when it comes to on the
[1:14:04] word of
[1:14:05] God. Did you hear me? It must come
[1:14:08] through the word of
[1:14:11] If you you can have faith in many
[1:14:13] things, but if it doesn't come from the
[1:14:14] word of God, it's going to be a baseless
[1:14:16] foundation. It's going to crumble.
[1:14:19] Everything your faith did you saw the
[1:14:22] picture of the pyramid? God had a reason
[1:14:25] why he puts faith at the bottom because
[1:14:27] faith is the foundation. So is and
[1:14:30] behind that foundation, behind that
[1:14:32] foundation, you know what is under that
[1:14:34] foundation? The word of God is faith is
[1:14:37] the word of God. faith sitting on top of
[1:14:39] the word of God because the word of God
[1:14:41] was there before the foundation it God
[1:14:44] said let there be let there be what
[1:14:47] there are things that were there before
[1:14:48] the foundation you were there before the
[1:14:50] foundation there were things that were
[1:14:52] created there were things that before
[1:14:54] there was a foundation they were there
[1:14:56] so that is why under the pyramid there's
[1:14:58] a foundation called the word of god and
[1:15:00] that is becomes the base that that faith
[1:15:03] they become the base of your building
[1:15:06] structure I hope I'm making sense
[1:15:10] Hallelujah. And if he abide, okay,
[1:15:13] brother is repeating what I was just
[1:15:14] reading for you. If he abide in me, my
[1:15:17] words in you, say what you will, there
[1:15:20] you
[1:15:21] are. Test it. Go try it. Go and try it
[1:15:25] and be patient with the Lord. You will
[1:15:27] see Jono what will happen. H go try my
[1:15:30] but I'm not saying you see the thing is
[1:15:31] this about the word of God. The word of
[1:15:33] God is here to encourage us, to uplift
[1:15:35] us, to show us, to correct us, to remind
[1:15:37] us. It's not here to to of course it is
[1:15:40] here to judge us, too. It's better for
[1:15:43] us to be judged now.
[1:15:46] Amen. It's better for for you to tell
[1:15:49] me, "No, my brother." No, no, no,
[1:15:51] brother. You may smile as much as you
[1:15:53] like, but here I think you are wrong, my
[1:15:57] friend. And correct me with love. It's
[1:16:00] better for you to help me
[1:16:03] now. It's better for me to say flate
[1:16:06] brother Andy. Oh no, my friend. No, no,
[1:16:08] no, no, no, no, no, minister. Even
[1:16:12] ministers, what's what's you you are
[1:16:14] wrong if you don't show your brother the
[1:16:16] right way. You are wrong. You are still
[1:16:18] wrong if you show him with the wrong
[1:16:21] attitude. So everything must fall in
[1:16:24] place according to the foundation.
[1:16:26] Everything must be according to the
[1:16:27] design, according to the plan of God.
[1:16:30] In this
[1:16:31] building, everything must synchronize.
[1:16:34] In this building, everything must
[1:16:36] synchronize and work together for good
[1:16:38] for the purpose of what God has made it
[1:16:40] to be.
[1:16:43] Let's just move on to the next
[1:16:47] quotation. If the body is correctly
[1:16:49] wired up and the fathers the father in
[1:16:52] heaven turns the big master switch on,
[1:16:55] something is going to rise up. You see?
[1:16:59] That's right. That is if the body is if
[1:17:01] the building is properly wired and if we
[1:17:04] are properly taught and every fiber of
[1:17:06] our body been lost in Christ. Every
[1:17:10] fiber and to his word alone his word.
[1:17:15] You remember the other foundation that I
[1:17:16] showed you that it has some conscious
[1:17:18] pipe or things coming. It's already
[1:17:20] preparing for the finishing but at
[1:17:22] foundational level they put those
[1:17:24] things. God is a great designer. He's a
[1:17:27] great designer. So he God already has
[1:17:30] put things in your life to make sure
[1:17:33] that when he presses the switch on all
[1:17:35] lies
[1:17:38] and you say, "No, I'm like this. No, I'm
[1:17:40] not like this." There's no such a thing.
[1:17:41] The pastor told you, "Don't believe the
[1:17:43] lie of the devil by by by wrongly
[1:17:46] accusing you." We need to learn and
[1:17:48] teach our children how to fight the mind
[1:17:50] battles,
[1:17:52] how to know that this is brother Andy
[1:17:54] was preaching here last week. He said,
[1:17:55] "Hey, you must wait and pause and say,
[1:17:57] who's speaking now?"
[1:17:59] And if you do that and you you you
[1:18:02] there's some thoughts going in there.
[1:18:04] You you
[1:18:04] wait who's thinking right now?
[1:18:08] You're going to find out that actually
[1:18:10] it's not you is the devil, but it's
[1:18:13] trying to be a parasite to use your
[1:18:15] mind. Be wise. The Bible says, "Be wise.
[1:18:20] Question question every thought." Don't
[1:18:23] I don't want a girl who just say yes yes
[1:18:25] yes yes yes yes. No. The bride of God
[1:18:28] don't just say yes yes yes yes.
[1:18:31] No no no no no. You
[1:18:35] question a boy who just come and know
[1:18:38] can I marry your daughter? No no no no
[1:18:40] no. Don't just agree. Yes yes yes yes
[1:18:43] yes. Ukraian baby. Okay
[1:18:49] my let's read the next one. Second last
[1:18:53] I think second or third
[1:18:55] last now I hope is going I I hope sorry
[1:19:01] I can't see properly now hope is one
[1:19:04] thing and faith is
[1:19:06] another faith is a positive sense it's
[1:19:10] not a a guess work you you just don't
[1:19:13] imagine it you see I've just told you
[1:19:16] now that faith is so real more real than
[1:19:18] this thing the true faith is not a hope
[1:19:21] like Okay. Uh no no God can help you
[1:19:25] with the revelation of your faith and
[1:19:27] you see the wow I can actually ask
[1:19:32] anything. That's how real faith
[1:19:35] is. You don't just imagine it is as real
[1:19:39] as any other sense of your body. Just
[1:19:42] the same as sight
[1:19:43] is. Sight is real. Healing I mean
[1:19:46] hearing is real. See, taste, feel,
[1:19:49] smell. Here the five senses of the body
[1:19:52] that control the body. There are real
[1:19:54] faculties to you if none of them is
[1:19:57] injured. And then faith is just as real
[1:20:00] as they are the other senses. And more
[1:20:03] real because it is it will go in and
[1:20:06] above all those senses.
[1:20:09] Do you believe this? Faith is so real
[1:20:13] and it's so simple and God can make it
[1:20:16] for you. So simple and you realize that
[1:20:19] ah this thing that even the professor of
[1:20:21] this of of diseases cannot heal it
[1:20:24] cannot help me they give up God can just
[1:20:26] heal it like that because of your
[1:20:30] faith he's
[1:20:38] able now that's the first and
[1:20:41] fundamental cause of divine healing here
[1:20:43] brother was talking about divine healing
[1:20:45] but I want you to take and just apply it
[1:20:47] to your life h even divine healing but
[1:20:52] to everything in your life that you take
[1:20:54] that first step of the foundation of
[1:20:56] faith then you'll see that's the true
[1:20:59] foundation and it is the word of God you
[1:21:03] will never come right if you don't take
[1:21:05] the word of God I'm telling you now I'm
[1:21:07] not hiding it for you you can't I can't
[1:21:11] everybody must come according to that
[1:21:13] plan of foundation of the foundation
[1:21:16] Faith cometh by hearing. I'll pass this.
[1:21:18] I'll just read the red part. Before we
[1:21:20] can have faith, we must have a basis of
[1:21:23] faith. What is the basis of faith? Open
[1:21:27] your heart. Read, accept, abide by the
[1:21:32] word. Then you'll see what will happen.
[1:21:34] How your faith is going to move
[1:21:36] mountains. You will see. That's the
[1:21:38] basis I'm talking about. You It's not
[1:21:41] just going to come because you say, you
[1:21:43] know, I believe.
[1:21:45] No, it must have a basis. I must open up
[1:21:48] my heart. I must abide. I must be
[1:21:50] willing. I must accept. I must
[1:21:52] sacrifice. I must love. I must be the
[1:21:54] Lord.
[1:21:58] And then go. Then you
[1:22:01] see you'll see what will
[1:22:04] happen.
[1:22:07] So and that's why we have to do by
[1:22:11] anyway by faith. We have to have the
[1:22:15] background a
[1:22:18] foundation. This is the this is the last
[1:22:20] one. I promise you this is the last
[1:22:24] slide. Then then we can just go home and
[1:22:28] internalize these
[1:22:29] things. Now from the message expectancy
[1:22:33] now no matter what the opposition looks
[1:22:36] like, Christ is the answer. Faith brings
[1:22:40] Christ. Amen. You see that word we are
[1:22:44] talking about is actually
[1:22:46] Christ. That word we are talking about
[1:22:48] is himself by himself. And then he the
[1:22:51] reason is we are saying is Christ is
[1:22:53] because and he wants you to have that
[1:22:54] foundation is because he wants you to be
[1:22:56] him to be like him to end up being him
[1:23:00] because in the end he's he did tell us
[1:23:02] that you me and you are one just like me
[1:23:05] and the father are one. You are actually
[1:23:07] God. You you are an amateur god. You
[1:23:11] That's right. You are You are not a a a
[1:23:14] a Is this a right way to say? I don't
[1:23:17] know. You're not just a hoy. You know
[1:23:19] what is a hoy? You're not just a a
[1:23:22] paluga walking around. You are a very
[1:23:25] important person. You are a son and
[1:23:28] imagine imagine you are God.
[1:23:32] God. Can you be associated with God?
[1:23:35] Yes. Can you be
[1:23:38] a I thought I thought the Bible we were
[1:23:42] taught that God put Adam in the Garden
[1:23:44] of Eden and made him go to
[1:23:46] everything. And then he also said to
[1:23:49] Moses, huh? You know when they looked at
[1:23:52] Moses, they could only see God through
[1:23:55] Moses. So the world can only see God
[1:23:59] through you today. Just imagine if I'm
[1:24:02] not doing anything. I'm not
[1:24:04] surrendering. I'm not reading. I'm
[1:24:05] bored. No, actually this brother is
[1:24:08] bossome. We need to go home. Actually, I
[1:24:11] can't hear him. Huh? Hear the word.
[1:24:16] Go and read and abide by him and watch
[1:24:19] the space. They say in English, watch
[1:24:22] the space. Watch what will happen.
[1:24:25] Faith brings Christ. Notice, could you
[1:24:28] remember? 80 years old, white bare
[1:24:30] beard, white hair, and yet the old man
[1:24:33] went around telling people that he
[1:24:35] wasn't going to to to die until he has
[1:24:38] seen the Lord's Christ. What a beautiful
[1:24:40] picture. Faith knows no defeat. Faith is
[1:24:44] perfect. Faith brings the things uh when
[1:24:48] there's no things to be brought. Faith
[1:24:51] creates. Faith takes doubt away. Faith
[1:24:56] takes negative and makes positive. How
[1:25:00] beautiful can this be man for faith to
[1:25:03] change my personality that was not there
[1:25:06] the personality of God and bring it and
[1:25:08] remove the old one the negative and
[1:25:10] bring the positive one. Faith creates.
[1:25:13] So it is an important thing more
[1:25:16] important than gold and silver. It is so
[1:25:19] important that any mineral is so
[1:25:21] important to you that you can use it to
[1:25:25] create your new Reuben.
[1:25:28] You can create your new Lilia. You can
[1:25:31] create
[1:25:32] everything. That's what faith and it
[1:25:34] doesn't give up. And it's patient. Did
[1:25:37] you see the building that I showed you?
[1:25:40] Every one of these that that I was
[1:25:43] showing you, they are sitting above
[1:25:46] faith. Faith is at the bottom.
[1:25:48] is
[1:25:49] patient knowledge. How else will will
[1:25:52] you just if you not not a worldly
[1:25:55] knowledge? You won't know the scripture.
[1:25:58] Your friends will ask you what do you
[1:26:01] mean? When I was a young boy, they used
[1:26:02] to ask me no no no if you say God God is
[1:26:05] there did you ever see him? But I never
[1:26:07] had the knowledge. I never read the
[1:26:09] Bible. I never I was not taught well
[1:26:12] when I was at a certain age and I didn't
[1:26:15] know what to tell them.
[1:26:17] No, no, no. I I I was just No, I'm going
[1:26:19] to church. No. Did you ever see God?
[1:26:22] They ask you, what do you say?
[1:26:24] You see, can you see why is it important
[1:26:26] for you to read your word to abide in
[1:26:28] him? So that when they ask you, hey, you
[1:26:30] you say God is there. You have you ever
[1:26:32] seen him? You you you did you see him?
[1:26:34] You say, ah, my friend, God does it
[1:26:37] cannot be seen by these eyes. You
[1:26:39] believe him. There's a scripture that
[1:26:41] nobody have ever seen
[1:26:43] God. And you ask them, "Hey, tell me
[1:26:45] something, my friend. Have you ever seen
[1:26:48] air?" They say, "No." So you say, you
[1:26:50] see, but you breathe it, right? So God
[1:26:54] God gives you wisdom. God gives you the
[1:26:57] the way, the spirit to discern and to
[1:26:59] answer. Why? Because you abide in him.
[1:27:02] He gives you the faith. He open things
[1:27:05] that mom and dad never told you. That's
[1:27:07] what happens. Not what mama and daddy.
[1:27:09] No, no, this their church. No, it must
[1:27:12] be your church. Amen.
[1:27:19] Oh, let me read that first for you. The
[1:27:22] old man has a basis of faith. Faith is
[1:27:24] not mythical, something mentally work,
[1:27:27] mentally worked up. It is an absolute
[1:27:30] fundamental result that happens in a
[1:27:33] person's
[1:27:35] heart. When faith is approp is
[1:27:38] appropriate is appropriated that then it
[1:27:42] is something in the person's heart but
[1:27:44] it can't be based on say well go uh go
[1:27:48] touch a tree and you'll get well no no
[1:27:50] no doesn't work like that well pray even
[1:27:53] if you
[1:27:55] fast 100
[1:27:56] times that cannot bring you faith the
[1:27:59] prophet says you can pray yes those
[1:28:02] things we need we can pray we can sing
[1:28:05] we can do whatever we do. We can even
[1:28:08] preach but faith cometh by you hearing
[1:28:11] the word of God and then me abiding in
[1:28:14] it. That's what it's going to all these
[1:28:17] things are to support other parts of the
[1:28:21] building. But the real revelation of
[1:28:24] faith comes by the word my boys and
[1:28:27] girls are you hearing me? That's how it
[1:28:30] comes. And I want you to go and continue
[1:28:32] doing that. Challenge yourself. Yes sir.
[1:28:36] Read that Bible until the enemy just
[1:28:39] run. Amen.
[1:28:42] Put your headphones and let them play
[1:28:44] and the battery finish you charge them
[1:28:46] listening to the audio Bible listening
[1:28:48] to the to the sermon. Yes.
[1:28:51] If you go there to Iran, you go there to
[1:28:53] Syria, you go there to Jerusalem, you go
[1:28:56] there to other faith faiths in the
[1:28:59] world, you'll find that even the
[1:29:01] children. I once saw a video a young is
[1:29:04] Israeli
[1:29:05] boy. You know, he's taught well picking
[1:29:10] up a stone heavier than him trying to
[1:29:12] pick it up. You know what he wanted to
[1:29:14] do? He wanted to go and throw it to to
[1:29:16] the to the terrorists who were
[1:29:18] destroying Israel. That boy was taught
[1:29:21] that here you go. The Lord your God. The
[1:29:23] Lord your God is
[1:29:25] one. You see? So just go and do it. If
[1:29:29] you don't understand, do it. Just do it.
[1:29:32] Yeah. Then you come and tell
[1:29:37] me. On that note, brothers and sisters,
[1:29:39] God bless you. God bless you. And let
[1:29:42] your foundation be steadfast
[1:29:46] more than the still. Let your foundation
[1:29:49] be renewed and be revived. Let your
[1:29:51] foundation be strengthened.
[1:29:55] If you can't find a way, go find how
[1:29:58] they do it physically. Because brother
[1:29:59] Ben, how do I revive a foundation? Then
[1:30:02] you take that and apply it in your life
[1:30:05] spiritually. Because the things of the
[1:30:07] physical types, the spiritual, I like
[1:30:09] typing things. Amen. As the musicians
[1:30:12] come, we are going to sing a
[1:30:14] song. And that
[1:30:16] song I I'm going to I'm going to open
[1:30:19] here because I recorded
[1:30:23] myself and then maybe
[1:30:28] um yeah, I remembered it now. So, but
[1:30:32] maybe can tell me what key is this.
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:43] You know this one.
[1:30:47] Oh yeah, you know it.
[1:30:50] Sorry, Esther. I promise you that we are
[1:30:52] going to sing this song as an item, but
[1:30:54] I never arranged with Isaac and you. But
[1:30:57] I will arrange. But let's just sing it
[1:30:58] as a as a preliminary now because I like
[1:31:01] it so much. It says, "On Christ the
[1:31:03] solid rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:31:06] sinking sand.
[1:31:08] My faith is
[1:31:10] built. I want us to sing that song if we
[1:31:14] know it.
[1:31:18] On Christ the
[1:31:21] soul rock.
[1:31:24] All other ground is sinking
[1:31:29] sand. All other
[1:31:32] ground is sinking
[1:31:35] sand. Let's sing in the chorus again.
[1:31:38] Succ.
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:56] Let's go. My hope. My hope.
[1:32:00] My hope is built on
[1:32:06] nothing. Jesus blood and
[1:32:11] righteousness I dare not trust the
[1:32:14] sweetest
[1:32:16] way but
[1:32:18] holy on Jesus name.
[1:32:27] That's the wrong
[1:32:28] song. All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:32:35] All other ground is sinking
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:47] sand. Do we know that part? There's uh
[1:32:50] when type in when darkness seems to hide
[1:32:53] his face. I just into this. We've got
[1:32:55] the song. It's like in public domain.
[1:32:56] This is not the one that this is. No,
[1:32:58] it's not it's not B. It's not that. So,
[1:32:59] no. Yeah, the words it's it's the same
[1:33:01] words a different song. The word is
[1:33:02] confused a bit. Yeah, but uh we should
[1:33:05] have it. But but but but but we can just
[1:33:06] sing the the chorus and just listen to
[1:33:10] it and sing it one time twice three
[1:33:12] times. Is that the one? Yeah. Go to the
[1:33:14] chorus. This one looks fine, but the
[1:33:16] chorus. No, it's not that one. The
[1:33:18] chorus looks
[1:33:19] strange. Do we not have it in public to
[1:33:22] me? It's all right. We can get it. We
[1:33:23] can get there. Yeah. On Christ stand on
[1:33:26] Christ.
[1:33:29] Is it? Yeah. Should be public otherwise.
[1:33:31] Okay, we can postpone. Is that the one,
[1:33:33] sister? That's the one.
[1:33:36] Okay, that's fine. Let's sing the chorus
[1:33:38] and then just keep the atmosphere and
[1:33:40] then we're going to
[1:33:41] pray. Brother Isaac will organize a full
[1:33:44] one for us, a full song. Let's give it a
[1:33:48] key. What am I doing? The chorus. Just
[1:33:50] the chorus. On Christ the
[1:33:54] solid rock I stand.
[1:33:57] All other ground is sinking
[1:34:02] sand. All other ground is sinking. All
[1:34:09] on Christy.
[1:34:12] On
[1:34:14] Christ
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:19] rock sinking sand.
[1:34:23] All other ground is seeking. One more
[1:34:28] time.
[1:34:30] On
[1:34:33] Christ rock I
[1:34:35] stand. All other ground is sinking
[1:34:41] sand. All other ground is singing sand.
[1:34:47] Oh Daisy. So this
[1:34:50] song this song it says that you you we
[1:34:54] need to stand on Christ the solid rock
[1:34:57] that's the only place and he is the word
[1:35:00] he is the word of God that I'm saying
[1:35:02] you must go and I must go and abide in
[1:35:05] it
[1:35:07] that's the solid rock all other ground
[1:35:09] is sinking said when the earthquakes and
[1:35:11] the tsunamis and the earthings of this
[1:35:13] world and everything of any stage of
[1:35:16] your life when they arm. They can't do
[1:35:19] nothing. Nothing. Not even death can do
[1:35:24] anything when you are standing on that
[1:35:25] solid rock. That's what I'm trying to
[1:35:28] show you young people and mothers and
[1:35:30] fathers on Christ the solid rock and he
[1:35:33] is the
[1:35:35] word. So let's just pray and then I'll
[1:35:39] give brother Isaac just to give us
[1:35:42] better tunes. Amen. Let's pray together.
[1:35:45] Our heavenly father, we thank you
[1:35:47] tonight Lord. We thank you heavenly
[1:35:49] father because you loved us so much so
[1:35:52] father that you chose us from before the
[1:35:56] foundation. Lord you you you brought us
[1:36:00] here at this time in our lives to come
[1:36:03] and manifest and fulfill the purpose
[1:36:05] that you created us for. We are so
[1:36:08] thankful father for brothers and
[1:36:10] sisters. We are so thankful for the
[1:36:11] bride of God. We are so thankful for the
[1:36:14] building of Jesus Christ. We are so
[1:36:16] thankful for the word. We are thankful
[1:36:18] for everything. The evidence is endless,
[1:36:21] Father, of what you have done. And all
[1:36:23] we can say, Father God, is to lift up
[1:36:25] our hearts, lift up our hands, and love
[1:36:28] you more and praise you. Father, we pray
[1:36:31] for our young
[1:36:32] people. Lord, we don't underestimate
[1:36:34] their power. That's the reason why the
[1:36:36] enemy attacks them because he's trying
[1:36:38] to attack the early stages of the
[1:36:41] foundation. And we cannot allow it. We
[1:36:44] stand against the enemy. We stand
[1:36:46] against all the forces of darkness of
[1:36:48] Satan to disturb our children's
[1:36:51] upbringing, to disturb our children's
[1:36:54] growing up in the word. Lord, all the
[1:36:57] things that come their way. Father, we
[1:36:59] bind them. We condemn them in the name
[1:37:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let there be
[1:37:04] no programs. Let there be no gadgets.
[1:37:07] Let there be no profiles or any
[1:37:10] platforms that can take the
[1:37:12] establishment of the proper foundation.
[1:37:15] Father, help the parents. Lord, help the
[1:37:18] pastor. Lord, help our deacons. Help
[1:37:20] every father as the as the as the leader
[1:37:23] of the household. Help every mother.
[1:37:26] Help every relative and everyone, Lord,
[1:37:29] that we can stand together in spirit,
[1:37:31] Father God, for this battle to be won.
[1:37:35] because we know that before the
[1:37:37] foundation the battle was already won.
[1:37:40] We thank you so much. May you go home
[1:37:42] with these people, Father, and bless
[1:37:44] them and bring us again at the appointed
[1:37:46] time even as we go to bulls on on
[1:37:49] Sunday. Lord, may you be with us, Lord.
[1:37:51] Come and bless the ministers. We pray
[1:37:53] for them. Come and anoint them, Lord.
[1:37:55] Circumcise their hearts and speak to us
[1:37:58] one more time and confirm your word in
[1:38:01] our lives individually and personally.
[1:38:04] Father, we ask these things in the name
[1:38:06] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:38:10] Amen. Let's slap hands for the
[1:38:14] Lord. So, so, so, so the only thing that
[1:38:17] I want to tell you before I I give
[1:38:20] brother Isaac chance to come is that you
[1:38:23] are reminded
[1:38:25] that on Sunday the service is there in
[1:38:28] Bulls. Please don't come here because we
[1:38:30] won't be here. We will be in Bulls.
[1:38:33] There is a seven course meal
[1:38:36] prepared for you. That's what you say
[1:38:39] here for on Sunday. Please the pastor
[1:38:42] asked me to remind you don't forget on
[1:38:45] Sunday and then brother Benny will send
[1:38:47] more details later on this week. But
[1:38:49] please we are so used and accustomed to
[1:38:51] come to church and we just find him. It
[1:38:53] happened to me before. So let's go there
[1:38:56] to pull. God bless you richly. Thank you
[1:38:58] brother

[1:39:10] sun where to stand in the
[1:39:15] morning? Who told the ocean you can only

[1:40:10] God that spins things for
[1:40:15] it. He runs to the weary, the one and
[1:40:20] the
[1:40:23] weak. And the same gentle hands that
[1:40:28] hold me when I'm
[1:40:30] broken. They conquer death to bring me
[1:40:37] victory. And I know my
[1:40:41] redeemer
[1:40:44] lives. I know my
[1:40:49] redeemer lives.

[1:41:39] lives forever. I'll
[1:41:44] proclaim that the payment for my sin was
[1:41:49] a precious life he gave. But now he's
[1:41:54] alive and there's an empty
[1:41:58] grave. And I know my
[1:42:03] redeemer lives.
