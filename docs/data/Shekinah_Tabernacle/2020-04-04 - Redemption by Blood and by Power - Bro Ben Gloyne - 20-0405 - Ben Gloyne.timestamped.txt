[26:44] you are the God and there's nothing
[26:47] thankful we can sing how great is our
[26:49] God just look into your word now Lord we
[26:56] know anyone who can read can open the
[26:58] pages of your Bible but if you know
[27:01] anything would come upon each heart O
[27:03] God and may you the author come and make
[27:05] your word live in our lives Lord we are
[27:07] we're living in unusual times but I want
[27:09] to lord I pray that be such the blood
[27:11] stability in your children Lord Jesus

[27:15] our God and Father may the magnitude
[27:17] Lord and the reality of our salvation
[27:19] become more apparent there is law to
[27:22] recognize what you've done for us law -
[27:24] now how we're our lives are sealed away
[27:26] and you hid away in Christ I pray Lord
[27:29] that you bless
[27:30] those who are watching father may your
[27:33] great presence being every home in every
[27:34] life and we dis man at the service into
[27:37] your hands Lord in Jesus Christ name
[27:40] Amen I mean god bless your friends so
[27:42] I'd like to speak this morning uh you
[27:47] know if I could take a subject I'd like
[27:49] to speak about Redemption by blood and
[27:51] by power now we read here oh yeah you
[27:55] know I'll come into it later but it's
[27:57] amazing I was reading through this a
[27:58] while ago I was reading through Exodus
[28:00] 15 and I was looking to dr. Scofield's
[28:03] notes regarding regarding this and and
[28:07] he would say that Redemption this is so
[28:10] so this is just his notes and I thought
[28:11] he summarizes through well this is that
[28:13] the exodus of the book of Exodus is a
[28:17] book of redemption and that Redemption
[28:19] is holy of God that Redemption comes
[28:22] through a person so an exodus it's
[28:25] through Moses and the New Testament it's
[28:27] through our Lord Jesus Christ and
[28:29] redemption comes by blood and by power
[28:31] redemption is by blood and redemption is
[28:34] by power now we know that we're living
[28:36] in perilous times you know the Jesus was
[28:38] asked by his disciples you know when
[28:40] would the end of the world be and he
[28:42] would he would begin to answer them in
[28:44] Matthew 24 he says take heed that no man
[28:46] deceive you for many shall come in my
[28:49] name saying I am Christ and shall
[28:51] deceive many and ye shall hear of wars
[28:53] and rumors of wars that you be not
[28:56] troubled all these things must come to
[28:59] pass but the end is not yet for nation
[29:02] shall rise against nation Kingdom
[29:05] against Kingdom and there shall be
[29:06] famines and we have famines and there
[29:09] shall be pestilences and we have
[29:10] pestilences earthquakes and diverse
[29:13] places and we have all those things and
[29:16] Jesus would say and these are the
[29:18] beginning of Sorrows and in and then
[29:20] when Jesus was speaking of are the same
[29:23] things in Luke I'll just take one
[29:24] scripture from Luke but but Jesus said
[29:26] now the answer to all this is and when
[29:28] you see these things come to pass then
[29:30] look up and lift up your heads for your
[29:32] redemption draws nigh so Lord Jesus
[29:36] himself said that there would be
[29:37] pestilences in these times so we should
[29:39] not lead we should not be surprised that
[29:41] these viruses are you know
[29:43] you know you know they spread through
[29:44] the earth and and we must recognize that
[29:47] even as a believer we are not immune
[29:49] from such things you know brother Brown
[29:51] would would would be alive when there
[29:53] was the pandemic of 1957 to 1958 it was
[29:57] called the other pandemic of the h2 into
[30:00] virus in it and and this is just from
[30:03] just looking at history and it says it
[30:05] was first reported in Singapore in 1957
[30:09] Hong Kong and April 1957 and in coastal
[30:13] cities in the United States in the
[30:15] summer of 1957 the estimated number of
[30:18] deaths was 1.1 million worldwide and a
[30:21] hundred and sixteen thousand in the
[30:23] United States so so there have been
[30:25] pandemics before and there may be
[30:27] pandemics again but this is just a sign
[30:30] of the end they would be pestilence
[30:31] there be earthquakes in diverse places
[30:33] there be famine to be wars and rumors of
[30:35] wars they see see see your hearts be not
[30:38] troubled don't be troubled in these
[30:39] times yeah even even brother Bram would
[30:42] say when when he was speaking about this
[30:45] I'm about this flu he says here in Susan
[30:49] 1957 and the 11th of December and says
[30:52] we would see Jesus you say now and be
[30:55] here with my good friend brother
[30:57] Hutchins and brother Joseph beau saying
[30:59] and this was supposed to be my vacation
[31:01] this fall I started a vacation and I
[31:04] like to hunt real well so I went out
[31:07] wished to go hunting the party I went
[31:09] with including myself all broke down
[31:11] here with this Asian flu now that's the
[31:14] pandemic I was just speaking about we
[31:16] all came down we all broke down here
[31:18] with this Asian flu we didn't even take
[31:20] our guns out of the cases and come back
[31:22] home so even these even these viruses
[31:24] you're even the Prophet got it so what
[31:27] what I'm saying is that these things are
[31:29] Pierson's they'll come through the you
[31:30] know in the end time but our heart
[31:32] shouldn't be troubled because they're
[31:33] upon the earth and but I want to say
[31:35] just because people get it doesn't mean
[31:37] they don't have the Holy Ghost you know
[31:38] some people want to make this is a
[31:39] supernatural plague and and and I guess
[31:42] in a way it is but it's just the
[31:43] pestilence is a sign of the end of the
[31:45] end yeah I mean so do not let your
[31:48] hearts be troubled as as Jesus would say
[31:50] now I just want to you know I'm you know
[31:53] I'm gonna go into Exodus a bit more we
[31:55] will get into
[31:56] being ready you know redemption by blood
[31:57] and by power but you know it's one thing
[32:00] we must be very aware of when Jesus
[32:02] would say he would say and he would say
[32:05] at a time when you think not as when the
[32:07] Son of Man will come HUD's and times
[32:10] where we don't think he will come as
[32:12] that's when he will come now endemic
[32:14] might go away this virus might go away
[32:17] and life might return to a semi-normal
[32:19] state we don't know but you know the
[32:22] thing is that we should not become all
[32:24] all religious and all excited just
[32:27] because there's a pestilence struck the
[32:28] land but we should be excited we should
[32:30] be alive and in the Lord Jesus because
[32:32] what he has done for us we have been
[32:34] sealed away by the Holy Ghost I mean we
[32:37] should be ready and waiting for the last
[32:39] Trump to sound and then we're gonna
[32:40] leave and then I'm that soon but you
[32:43] know I just want to say this very very
[32:45] clearly spotting you know it's not about
[32:48] your this day people are so caught up in
[32:50] conspiracy theories you know was it
[32:52] China was it as it is that the United
[32:54] Nations trying to make a one-world
[32:56] government is that you know is at 5g is
[32:58] it you know what is all the stuff and
[33:00] you know I want to say spotting you know
[33:03] let's not be caught up in conspiracy
[33:05] theory right let's not be up on these
[33:07] things l our minds in our heart
[33:09] shouldn't be fixed on trying to spot the
[33:11] bogeyman yeah we shouldn't be trying to
[33:13] spot the boogeyman because we have to
[33:15] recognize just spotting the boogeyman
[33:18] isn't gonna give us rapturing faith not
[33:20] gonna give us rapturing faith one but
[33:22] you know people can see where the enemy
[33:24] is in every detail but yet mr. rapture
[33:26] yeah I mean spotting the boogeyman is
[33:28] not going to help us or trying to find
[33:30] the boogeyman it's not going to help us
[33:33] take a body change yeah right so I'd be
[33:36] so consumed at all it could be this it
[33:38] could be that I mean but what about your
[33:39] own soul a make sure you meet the Lord
[33:41] Jesus are you under the blood I mean
[33:43] have you been that's the most important
[33:47] thing because Jesus said there would be
[33:50] piss Lots in these times so he shouldn't
[33:52] be surprised at this pestilence in the
[33:53] land yeah and we must recognize that
[33:56] your God is not panicking because the
[33:58] world has shut down this has stopped my
[34:03] program what am I gonna do what's plan B
[34:05] he doesn't have a plan because he
[34:07] doesn't need a plan B
[34:09] plan a in a Sunnah is going to the world
[34:11] and preach the gospel cause as a devil
[34:13] or you find him these signs shall follow
[34:15] them that believe you say well we
[34:17] freedom to go preach they were used to
[34:19] maybe not but we're still under a
[34:20] commission right you can still with your
[34:23] phone with you know over the Internet
[34:25] you can still reach people you can still
[34:27] be a witness you can still be salty
[34:29] I mean you still be a living witness
[34:31] even in this time hallelujah so so we
[34:35] shouldn't get so worried about
[34:36] conspiracy theory man is not gonna help
[34:39] you overcome amen I mean we see the
[34:44] Matthew 24 because no no I'll just say
[34:47] this now this might all just blow over
[34:49] and it potentially could might not but a
[34:52] potentially could in those who are it
[34:55] but the problem is when that happens as
[34:57] those who are all excited about
[34:58] conspiracy theory as when life returns
[35:01] back to normal then they actually can
[35:03] become more cynical about the coming of
[35:05] the Lord as I saw I thought he was going
[35:07] to come in when that virus was on all I
[35:09] thought the global crash was going to
[35:11] cause a rapture no I thought this
[35:12] earthquake you know but you know and
[35:14] then but then when life returns back to
[35:15] normal they become cynical and it has
[35:18] become hardened because they are looking
[35:19] at the wrong thing
[35:21] Oh looking at the water God and being
[35:23] caught up in the revelation of the hour
[35:25] then amen when when that happens to a
[35:28] soul they'll be watching and waiting for
[35:29] that day hallelujah the rapture is for
[35:34] the raptured you know we know the word
[35:36] rapture means the catching away it's
[35:38] like an eagle with its talons catching
[35:39] it's prey and taking it away it's
[35:41] wrapped off as the you know it's the
[35:43] catching away so to the rapture are
[35:46] those so the catching away is for those
[35:50] who are caught away in the Word of God
[35:52] for the day no rapture is for the
[35:55] raptured right I mean so so that's the
[35:58] kind of condition we want to be and we
[35:59] want to be caught up in the Lord Jesus
[36:01] want to be in love with him walk
[36:03] rejoicing in our salvation I mean that's
[36:06] how we want to be in this hour we could
[36:10] just become more cynical when this thing
[36:12] blows over is well I thought it was then
[36:14] well other people have been saying it
[36:15] for years it's happening in our and and
[36:17] it just hardens people's hearts now
[36:20] brother Bram would say and the presence
[36:23] of God unrecognized in 1964 he'd say now
[36:27] look you know the coming of the Lord is
[36:29] going to be a secret coming yeah
[36:31] there'll be two in the beard and I'll
[36:33] take one and leave one that's where the
[36:35] nighters turn the field I'll take one
[36:37] and leave one that's the daytime you
[36:38] know there's so many people disappear
[36:40] every day off the face of the earth that
[36:42] nobody can account for one of these days
[36:44] that might be that people might say well
[36:46] you mean the tribulation the thing is on
[36:48] us now I thought the church would go
[36:51] before the tribulation they don't
[36:52] realize and understand that the rapture
[36:54] could take place and they would know
[36:56] nothing about it
[36:57] he says it's the secret going of the
[37:00] church so the rapture is not necessarily
[37:03] just a coming it's actually a secret
[37:05] going all right I mean as the bride
[37:07] being caught away and taken up into
[37:09] glory that is the rapture I mean brother
[37:12] bran would say it's like Romeo and
[37:13] Juliet where where where Romeo comes the
[37:16] little or not puts a ladder up against
[37:17] the house and grab Julie and and runs
[37:20] away with her why because it's a secret
[37:22] going amen and that's the condition we
[37:26] should be ready our lamps trimmed and
[37:28] clear I'll be so full of all he doesn't
[37:31] come today he'll come tomorrow if he
[37:33] doesn't come tomorrow he'll come next
[37:35] week but I'm watching waiting for that
[37:36] moment
[37:37] I know lujah that my whole life is now
[37:39] built around and focused upon that
[37:42] moment where we change to me amen no and
[37:47] then also the thing is when people see
[37:49] one thing is that we need to realize
[37:52] what's going on and not just realize
[37:56] what's going on but become part of it
[37:59] what's going on you see you talking
[38:01] about Doug get caught up and trying to
[38:03] find all the boogie men nothing about
[38:04] your realizing what's going on there I'm
[38:07] talking about the realization as Christ
[38:09] and his bride have become one in this
[38:11] hour I mean that she is robed and the
[38:13] his righteousness ready for the call to
[38:16] the wedding supper in the sky and that's
[38:17] really what's going on remember the
[38:19] whole world the whole world is falling
[38:21] apart because the bride is coming into
[38:23] her position in the word of word of so
[38:26] that's the real thing that's going on
[38:28] and that's the real thing we should be
[38:29] looking for and not just looking at
[38:31] becoming a part of
[38:33] oh yeah I mean because you know we don't
[38:37] want to we don't want to fail because
[38:40] the thing is if we look at all the
[38:44] conspiracy theory I'm just gonna hammer
[38:46] this because I feel I've got a hammer it
[38:47] right now if we if we get caught up in
[38:50] conspiracy theory and what might be in
[38:52] what happens is eventually that will
[38:56] actually just give us unbelief in the
[38:58] message because it will not be it will
[39:01] not equate to what what the prophetess
[39:04] is what the Bible said so he just
[39:06] produce unbelief because what it
[39:08] actually comes down to his people say
[39:09] well brother Bram just didn't know what
[39:11] he was talking about because that's
[39:15] exactly what it will equate to because I
[39:18] said well he didn't know what we were
[39:19] facing him this time he didn't see the
[39:21] technology and the viruses and all these
[39:24] things so he doesn't know what he's
[39:26] talking about so then what does that do
[39:28] that puts unbelief in a person against
[39:31] the Word of God yeah so that's why we
[39:33] shouldn't be caught up in those things
[39:35] we should be caught up in the scripture
[39:38] and the message that's what we should be
[39:40] caught up in remember how can God give a
[39:43] light to an age and then but but that
[39:46] light is only for a certain portion of
[39:48] the age you know in the days of the
[39:54] voice of the seventh angel when he
[39:56] should begin to sound the mystery of God
[39:57] should be finished now we are living in
[40:00] the days of the voice of the seventh
[40:01] angel it didn't say in the days of the
[40:03] voice of the seventh angel and then some
[40:05] other people that claim to be a Thane
[40:07] JAL's after doesn't say that says in the
[40:10] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[40:11] but that means that that that we're
[40:14] living in the days was voices voice was
[40:16] recorded and that voice is good for the
[40:18] entirety of the age that's why we should
[40:22] not get caught up in conspiracies that
[40:25] belief for now soul saying he didn't
[40:27] know what he was talking about and he
[40:29] knew what he was talking about amen he
[40:32] would say in the evening messenger here
[40:34] we are in time red light down flashing
[40:38] coming of the Lord is at hand yes sir
[40:40] listen the entire message should meet
[40:42] endtime conditions which they got off
[40:44] the message ought to bring it back
[40:46] always in time
[40:47] such meets in time conditions I mean so
[40:50] so that's happened all the way down
[40:52] through the scripture the end time
[40:53] messenger Noah's day met the condition
[40:55] right the yeah you know the message in
[40:57] Moses day met the condition of the age
[40:59] Jesus message met the condition of the
[41:01] age amen so so we're living in an end
[41:04] time again amen where the Gentile
[41:06] dispensation is coming to an end and
[41:08] we've received the message and that
[41:09] message meets in time conditions
[41:11] yourself at meeting in time conditions
[41:14] I'm gonna be focusing on that I mean I'm
[41:16] not gonna be worried about what people
[41:18] think is going on or or you know your
[41:20] people are just presuming and in China
[41:22] you know you're trying to get people
[41:23] distracted now we've received a
[41:25] vindicated voice in this our God came in
[41:27] behind and proved it over and over and
[41:30] over I mean that you this is not having
[41:32] it he said he wanted to be a trapper he
[41:35] said you know he didn't want to do those
[41:36] things but God rich and mercy came amen
[41:39] and manifested himself through his
[41:41] ministry hallelujah they made you see
[41:43] you know like when the seals were coming
[41:45] over and brother hammer would come to
[41:46] the pulpit said well I thought it was
[41:47] this like the first horse rider he says
[41:49] well I'll just take the notes that I had
[41:51] before and maybe this is just what it is
[41:53] but then he said then the Lord came down
[41:55] into the room and told him exactly what
[41:57] the scripture meant hallelujah and then
[41:59] he could see the revelation given to him
[42:01] by the Lord match the scripture exactly
[42:03] you know so and that happened night
[42:04] after night after night so you know this
[42:07] message is not William branham's message
[42:09] amen it has been as God's message
[42:12] hallelujah so now we have to look at
[42:15] then what what we have what what the
[42:17] pressure of this age would be amen
[42:20] so brother Graham would say in the
[42:22] church age book and our trustee of ones
[42:24] following along he sees in the reciter
[42:26] in church age where where Jesus says
[42:31] that all what I will put upon you none
[42:34] other burden he says the word for burden
[42:37] is weight or pressure the pressure of
[42:40] the Dark Ages was either bend will be
[42:42] broken bow or die
[42:43] it was the Inquisition the power of the
[42:45] Empire backing up satanic worship be
[42:48] organized or pay with your life each age
[42:51] has its precious for example a great
[42:54] burden of the last age is the pressure
[42:56] of riches soft loving and nervous
[42:59] tension in a complex age
[43:01] we seem unfit to live in so that's the
[43:05] big pressure of the age its riches yeah
[43:08] off living and nervous tensions complex
[43:12] age that we seem unfit to live and this
[43:14] is a very complex age you know we are
[43:16] we're actually told this is just by I'm
[43:19] psychologists and scientists that it
[43:21] used to be that every day we would
[43:23] receive one newspapers worth of
[43:25] information but now because of we're
[43:27] connected to the world I mean our brain
[43:29] has to process 30 newspapers worth of
[43:32] information every day and we constantly
[43:34] connect them with people with constant
[43:36] connected with what's going on around us
[43:38] it's a very complex age and and because
[43:42] it's so complex there's a lot of nervous
[43:43] tension you know you know life used to
[43:45] be down to not just the hour but the
[43:47] minute not just a minute but the second
[43:49] amen and then what and and so the
[43:51] pressure of the age will be richest and
[43:53] that is the pressure of the age yeah
[43:55] that's why this world is panicking
[43:57] because they're shutting down why
[43:58] because riches of being a you know the
[44:00] economy is falling apart
[44:02] yes great pressure soft loving is a
[44:05] pressure thing is a pressure and nervous
[44:10] tensions those are the pressures or the
[44:14] weights that the believer would have to
[44:15] overcome but thanks be to God amen power
[44:18] of the Holy Ghost
[44:21] yeah so now let's go back to our thought
[44:23] as I said dr. Scofield wrote about you
[44:28] know Redemption it has to come through a
[44:31] person hallelujah and we know that our
[44:34] Redemption came through not a man that
[44:36] was just born of you know you know he
[44:38] was a Jew he wasn't a Gentile but here's
[44:40] God Almighty made flesh in Apostle Paul
[44:43] would say that was the blood of God that
[44:45] was you know you're the Holy Ghost I
[44:47] mean he sees to feed the Church of God
[44:49] which he has purchased with his own
[44:50] blood which is the blood of God I mean
[44:52] so our Redemption didn't come through a
[44:54] natural man or even a redeemed man I
[44:56] mean but our redemption came through God
[44:58] becoming a man hallelujah amen so
[45:02] redemption and the New Testament speaks
[45:05] about other definition it means a ransom
[45:08] in full that is amen
[45:12] I mean that means figuratively a written
[45:14] source
[45:15] the Christian salvation I mean so
[45:17] Redemption is a ransom and fall so it's
[45:19] not in part it's not a partial ransom
[45:21] it's not a just well Dibble I'll take a
[45:23] part of them you can have part of them
[45:25] and therefore it's Redemption that's now
[45:27] redemption redemption is a full
[45:29] deliverance I mean it's a full it's a
[45:31] full redemption I mean it is a full
[45:34] ransom hallelujah amen and it also comes
[45:37] from the word which means something to
[45:39] loosen worth I mean that is the
[45:41] redemption price or a ransom so we have
[45:43] been redeemed we've been loosened from
[45:44] the grips of sin I mean from the grips
[45:46] of the devil I mean by the blood of
[45:48] Jesus Christ paid a fool um-um Hosea
[45:55] would speak about Israel being being
[45:57] been called out of Egypt and he'd say
[46:00] and Hosea 11 and 1 he says when Israel
[46:03] was a child I loved him and called my
[46:06] son out of Egypt so so when when God
[46:10] came down into the Ministry of Moses and
[46:12] and God redeemed Israel out of you know
[46:15] you know out of the bondage of slavery
[46:17] that was because God was calling his son
[46:20] I mean out of Egypt out of slavery I
[46:22] mean I mean to to to walk with him now
[46:26] we know that when Israel came out of
[46:28] Egypt there was a mixed multitude went
[46:30] up with him so so it wasn't everyone who
[46:32] came out of Egypt was actually the son
[46:33] of God wasn't his child I mean but
[46:36] Redemption here was was God was calling
[46:38] a part of himself out of Egypt amen
[46:41] I mean to - now coming to the promised
[46:44] land because we know that children are
[46:46] part of the appearance right I've isn't
[46:48] a part of me Amen I mean you're everyone
[46:51] who has children they're a part of you
[46:52] so so the children of God are part of
[46:55] God yeah and God can't lose a part of
[46:57] himself it's impossible I mean he cannot
[47:00] lose one of his he can't lose one of his
[47:02] attributes I mean so he called them
[47:04] called them out of Egypt but in order to
[47:07] call them out of Egypt he had to redeem
[47:09] them by blood he had redeemed them by
[47:11] blood and also redeemed them by power
[47:15] heart and pharaoh said well I'll let
[47:17] them go no God had to come and powerful
[47:20] become a manifestation is glory I mean
[47:23] to break the shackles of
[47:25] of slavery off of the Egypt I mean I
[47:28] mean Rosie
[47:29] I mean God had to play your Pharaoh in
[47:35] his kingdom you know God had to pour out
[47:37] his wrath and pour out his judgment upon
[47:38] you know you know upon Pharaoh and and
[47:41] and all of Egypt so so an order that
[47:43] Pharaoh would eventually say okay you
[47:45] can go and the glorious thing about when
[47:48] when Israel left Egypt everyone came
[47:51] Moses was determined we're not leaving a
[47:54] hoof behind and there was God speaking
[47:56] through Moses to Pharaoh this is God
[47:58] saying to Pharaoh not one of them
[48:00] staying not even our cattle not our
[48:02] young our old they're all coming worth
[48:04] and this is how God is determined to
[48:05] redeem us welcome I'm gonna break the
[48:11] yoke of sin I'm good I'm going to take
[48:13] away their first nature I'm gonna break
[48:15] every shackle of the devil off their
[48:17] lives and they're gonna come hallelujah
[48:19] well then the father has given me will
[48:21] come and all that comes we all know wise
[48:22] cast out okay what a blessed Savior we
[48:25] have yeah so so he had to redeem them by
[48:29] blood and he also had to redeem them by
[48:31] power now now I just want to so and so
[48:37] in Hebrews 11 I mean I mean Hebrews 9
[48:39] and 11 it says this now you know I hope
[48:41] you don't mind too much reading this is
[48:43] but Christ being made a high priest of
[48:45] good things to come my greater and more
[48:48] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[48:50] that is to say not of this building
[48:52] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[48:55] but by his own blood he entered once
[48:57] into the holy place having obtained
[49:00] eternal redemption for us Alleluia
[49:03] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[49:05] and of ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[49:08] unclean sanctified to the purifying of
[49:11] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[49:13] of Christ who through the eternal
[49:16] spirits spirit offered himself without
[49:19] spot to God purge your conscience from
[49:22] dead works to serve the Living God cause
[49:26] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[49:28] that is by means of death for the
[49:31] redemption of the transgressions that
[49:33] were under the first Testament they
[49:35] which are called might receive the
[49:37] promise of eternal inheritance
[49:39] yes or a testament is there must also
[49:43] have necessity be the death of the
[49:45] testator for the Testament is a force
[49:48] after Mina did otherwise it is of no
[49:50] strength at all while the testator
[49:53] liveth whereupon neither the first
[49:55] Testament was dedicated without blood so
[49:59] so the Apostle Paul is telling the
[50:01] Hebrews you know the blood of Jesus
[50:05] Christ gives us a far greater Redemption
[50:07] than the blood of bulls and goats I mean
[50:09] that was just a shadow but now you've
[50:11] got to come into the reality what you
[50:12] know that Jesus as he said would would
[50:16] would go up into glory to receive an
[50:18] eternal redemption for us I mean a
[50:20] hallelujah there so glorious I mean now
[50:23] we know redeem means to buy back to
[50:25] restore back to original position now
[50:29] you know the scripture tells us that our
[50:33] redemption is as completely of God it's
[50:36] not our own ability you know not one man
[50:38] can redeem another you know not one of
[50:40] us can can can can free ourselves from
[50:43] our first nature that we're born with
[50:44] our fallen nature I mean that one of us
[50:47] can can can free ourselves from the
[50:49] chains of sin it takes God to do it I
[50:52] mean God is our Redeemer you know he he
[50:55] is causing in such a way that no man can
[50:57] boast and you know in in his own
[50:59] Redemption God that redeems is God that
[51:02] saves us God that justifies hallelujah
[51:05] so this is why we can rejoice this
[51:06] morning
[51:07] I mean redeemed by blood and by power I
[51:10] mean the blood of Jesus Christ has
[51:11] redeemed us in the power of the Holy
[51:13] Ghost is here to ensure we receive the
[51:15] fullness of our Redemption you know now
[51:19] God would tell Moses and an exodus sex
[51:22] he says wherefore saying to the children
[51:24] of Israel I am the Lord and I'll bring
[51:26] you out from under the burdens of the
[51:28] Egyptians I will rid you out of their
[51:30] bondage hallelujah I like his language
[51:32] I will deem you with an outstretched arm
[51:35] and with grab desmos I will take I will
[51:38] take you to me for a people and I will
[51:41] be a god and I will be to you a god and
[51:43] ye shall know that I am the Lord your
[51:45] God that brings you out from under the
[51:48] burden of the Egyptians
[51:52] hallelujah amen so you saying I'm gonna
[51:56] do with an outstretched arm I'm gonna
[51:58] redeem you hallelujah
[51:59] I mean I'm gonna rid you of their
[52:01] bondage I mean I'm gonna break the
[52:03] shackles of their slavery completely
[52:04] you're gonna be a free people remember
[52:06] the purpose of it was out of Egypt I
[52:08] have called my sons there's a call went
[52:10] forth unto Egypt and God was calling for
[52:12] his children to come out of the bondage
[52:14] of slavery and walk with him now God
[52:18] would say in the verdict is 26 because
[52:20] we look at the purpose what is the
[52:21] purpose of being you know you know you
[52:23] know of them being freed from slavery it
[52:25] wasn't just that God could see if he
[52:26] could do it there was a purpose and the
[52:28] redemption Amen that God would manifest
[52:30] in Israel and he would say in Leviticus
[52:33] 26 and 11 he says and I will set my
[52:36] Tabernacle among you and my soul shall
[52:38] not abhor you and I will walk among you
[52:42] and will be your God and you shall be my
[52:44] people I am the Lord your God which
[52:46] brought you forth out of the land of
[52:48] Egypt that ye should not be their bond
[52:50] men and I have broken the bands of their
[52:53] yoke that ye may go up right those
[52:56] purposes I want to walk among you that's
[52:59] all I want to put my Tabernacle among
[53:00] you that I will walk among you and I'll
[53:02] be your God and you shall be my feet for
[53:06] calling his son out of Egypt I want to
[53:08] walk among you
[53:09] children o at all I want to walk among
[53:11] you my Tabernacle among you ought to be
[53:13] identified with my children I'm going to
[53:15] walk with them hallelujah because I've
[53:18] broken the bands of your yoke that you
[53:21] may go up rise remember that day when we
[53:23] eat when you're burdened down with
[53:24] sitting there's that great yoke of
[53:25] bondage upon your neck but God's I'm
[53:27] gonna break that band of your yoke that
[53:29] you can walk upright the UConnect I know
[53:32] you're not under the whiplash of the
[53:34] evil but you're a son and daughter of
[53:35] God and he can walk upright little you
[53:38] with the Lord but we have to recognize
[53:41] it because of the blood of bulls and
[53:44] goats God could only walk next to the
[53:45] children he could not go any further
[53:48] than just being next to them even even
[53:50] this was shown on Mount Sinai when when
[53:53] when God told Moses yo to come up into
[53:56] the mountain um but he said put a
[53:57] boundary around the mountain because you
[53:59] know because it's going to be a holy
[54:00] mountain cuz I'm gonna come down on that
[54:02] mountain so put a boundary
[54:03] and that no one can no one can come up
[54:06] the mountain either you know they had
[54:07] they had to Stacy's even if a you know a
[54:09] kettle beast or something walked on the
[54:12] mountain they had to be killed and this
[54:14] is because their God
[54:15] Amon could not dwell where an unholy
[54:18] people were I mean I don't know the
[54:20] blood of bulls and goats covered this
[54:22] and it could not change the fallen
[54:25] nature they were born with her yet God
[54:27] could only be you know there was a
[54:28] certain separation still between God and
[54:31] man even though God was walking among
[54:33] them he wanted to put his Tabernacle
[54:35] among them there's still a separation I
[54:37] mean between God and the peoples you
[54:39] know his brother bran would say that
[54:41] that that when God came down Mount Sinai
[54:43] it was death amen
[54:45] to go up the mountain so it was death to
[54:48] step into the pillar fire and that day
[54:50] but because the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:52] has come and rent the veil amen and not
[54:54] just covered our sins but but but washed
[54:56] all our sins away
[54:57] now what stairs not to steppin to the
[54:59] pillar of fire its death not to go into
[55:01] the Holy of Holies Oliver so now it's yo
[55:04] swapped around completely oh so in the
[55:07] old days when God could just walk among
[55:09] them but that wasn't his final you know
[55:11] you know that wasn't really where he
[55:13] wanted to end up because we know that
[55:14] the soul of man is the resting place of
[55:17] God I mean so so his purpose wasn't just
[55:20] to walk among them but was to walk in
[55:22] them amen and then finally Jesus shed
[55:26] his blood because remember there had to
[55:27] be not just a redemption from slavery
[55:29] but they had to be Redemption from the
[55:31] sin nature I mean that we were born with
[55:33] a mean God had to shed his blood upon
[55:36] the earth give a perfect sacrifice I
[55:38] mean that we would be redeemed not just
[55:40] from slavery like the Israelites were I
[55:44] mean but we would be redeemed from our
[55:46] full of nature we were born worth amen
[55:48] and we would be born again God would not
[55:51] just walk with us but he would walk in
[55:54] us all would would write to the
[55:58] Corinthians he'd say in 2nd Corinthians
[56:00] 6 and 16 he says and what agreement hath
[56:02] the temple of God with idols for ye are
[56:05] the Temple of the Living God as God hath
[56:07] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[56:10] them and I will be their God and they
[56:12] shall be my people so he's not saying
[56:14] I'm gonna walk
[56:15] I'm gonna walk in you I mean I'm gonna
[56:17] dwell not with you but now in you and
[56:19] I'm gonna walk not next you but I'm
[56:21] gonna walk in them how gay men now that
[56:23] you have the Holy Ghost God is within
[56:26] you
[56:26] I mean when you get out of bed and you
[56:27] walk a man to the kitchen guys walking
[56:29] in you when you go to your family your
[56:31] job Amen that's glory hallelujah now we
[56:47] know he's also called us out of this
[56:48] world but you know we are instructed by
[56:51] the Prophet going into the going into
[56:55] the going into the you know you know the
[57:00] type of the first Passover which we're
[57:01] going to go into now but Israel he sees
[57:04] in the token he says Israel was
[57:06] commanded to stay under that blood until
[57:09] marching orders come so we're actually
[57:11] commanded to stay in Passover until that
[57:14] last Trump sounds I mean then we go from
[57:16] this world to the next world this is
[57:18] this is mere way to focus upon yeah it's
[57:21] not the focus upon boogeymen I mean it's
[57:24] a focus on staying and Passover with our
[57:26] Lord Jesus said that the final plague to
[57:30] strike the church or strike the earth
[57:32] with spiritual death and that is the
[57:35] thing that we need to be aware of as
[57:37] spiritual death is riding in the land
[57:39] amen at a striking people but if you're
[57:42] under the blood of Jesus Christ it
[57:44] cannot strike you the devil can't trick
[57:48] us into becoming lost you are sealed to
[57:52] the day of your Redemption amen
[57:54] the devil can't break that seal cannot
[57:57] break that seal that we cannot get to
[58:00] our final destination right it's
[58:02] impossible for him to unbreak the
[58:05] sealing of the Holy Ghost amen so that
[58:08] means that the devil can't have the Holy
[58:11] Ghost of your seal to the day of your
[58:13] Redemption the devil can't trick you to
[58:15] becoming lost oh right he can't trick
[58:18] you or give you this chip with us right
[58:20] you know the mark of the beast is being
[58:21] spiritual all the way down through the
[58:23] scripture it's not a chip not a
[58:26] detective
[58:27] it's a virtual mark amen true to receive
[58:30] to receive life how do you receive the
[58:33] Holy Ghost you receive the word
[58:35] how do people receive the mark of the
[58:37] beast a religious spirit they reject the
[58:39] word all the way down through the
[58:43] scripture from the marking of Cain all
[58:45] the way down through the scripture has
[58:47] been the mark of the beast but they all
[58:49] come a day when the full manifestation
[58:51] that mark happens but then also the full
[58:53] manifestation of the seal of God will
[58:55] happen manifestations the seal of God
[58:57] will be the change in the body you will
[58:59] recognize what we've been sealed with
[59:01] what we'll be hearing I mean since we
[59:03] met the Lord I mean so we don't need to
[59:07] worry about chips or 5g or whatever G
[59:10] you already hears about the jeast we
[59:12] don't need to worry about those things
[59:14] but if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost
[59:16] you're safe and secure virtual marquise
[59:22] yo you go all the way through the
[59:24] scripture you'll see the seal of God and
[59:27] the seal and and the mark of the beast
[59:29] all the way down through the scripture
[59:31] yes we don't need to worry about those
[59:34] exodia will can't trick you into
[59:36] suddenly becoming lost I mean if you
[59:39] have the Holy Ghost now we're commanded
[59:42] to stay and pass over until the last
[59:44] Trump sounds now just as just as
[59:49] spiritual death was was striking Egypt
[59:52] that night but before spiritual death
[59:54] will come before that death angel rather
[59:55] could come into the land
[59:57] I mean God told Moses to get the people
[1:00:01] to take a lamb amen take a lamb kill
[1:00:05] that lamb take the blood strike it on
[1:00:07] the two doorpost in the upper doorpost
[1:00:09] of the house and then where and they
[1:00:11] shall eat that lamb so so they instruct
[1:00:14] us he said this was the way that that
[1:00:16] death angel could not strike him as the
[1:00:18] blood was applied right all the leaven
[1:00:21] was was was got out of the house right
[1:00:23] unleavened bread I mean let's just read
[1:00:26] it shall we
[1:00:26] Exodus 12 and 5 see these things you
[1:00:30] know the types become more of a reality
[1:00:32] in this day yeah more of a real thing
[1:00:35] becomes my you know we can you say well
[1:00:37] I've heard about you know you know
[1:00:39] applying the token of her
[1:00:41] about eating the lamb of y'all heard
[1:00:42] about the Passover maybe for decades but
[1:00:45] they can't succumb a time where it
[1:00:46] become so real I mean because we could
[1:00:48] actually see now this is the state I'm
[1:00:50] living in and we took God calls me home
[1:00:53] as I said spiritual death is riding in
[1:00:57] this last age that's what the death
[1:01:00] angel was striking Egypt but now we live
[1:01:02] in a time I mean where we're just as
[1:01:05] they were under the bloodsafe the
[1:01:07] Israelites were or actually anyone could
[1:01:09] have done it I believe it they didn't
[1:01:10] have to just me otherwise they just take
[1:01:12] the word of Moses apply the blood as
[1:01:14] they are instructed and they would have
[1:01:16] been fine I mean as the same now it's
[1:01:18] even greater today amen we're where we
[1:01:21] have the Word of God we can apply the
[1:01:22] Word of God we can do it in faith apply
[1:01:25] the blood and faith I mean and that
[1:01:26] death angel can't you know that
[1:01:27] spiritual death can't get us but we're
[1:01:29] safe until that last trumpet sounds know
[1:01:32] says you shall take you shall your lamb
[1:01:35] this is an exodus 12 and 5 your lamb
[1:01:38] shall be without blemish a male or the
[1:01:40] first year you shall take it out from
[1:01:43] the Sheep or from the goats and you
[1:01:45] shall keep it up until the fourteenth
[1:01:47] day of the same month and the whole
[1:01:48] Assembly of the congregation of Israel
[1:01:50] shall kill it in the evening why the
[1:01:52] Bloods got to be applied in the evening
[1:01:53] time and we're living in the eastern
[1:01:55] time I mean the time is cleaning with
[1:01:57] eternity time is running out it's the
[1:01:59] evening time and you shall take of the
[1:02:01] blood and strike it on the toy to
[1:02:03] doorpost and the upper doorpost of the
[1:02:05] houses ruin you shall eat it and you
[1:02:07] shall eat the flesh and that night roast
[1:02:09] with fire and unleavened bread and with
[1:02:12] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat it
[1:02:14] not eat not of it raw nor sodden it all
[1:02:17] with water but roast with fire hid with
[1:02:20] his legs and with the pertinent parts
[1:02:22] thereof and ye shall let nothing of it
[1:02:24] remain till the morning and that which
[1:02:26] remaineth of it until the morning shall
[1:02:28] burn with fire
[1:02:29] and thus shall ye eat it with your loins
[1:02:31] girded your shoes on your feet your
[1:02:33] staff in your hand
[1:02:34] you shall eat it in haste that is the
[1:02:36] Lord's Passover I mean so this is the
[1:02:40] instructions that that Israel was given
[1:02:42] this is how they had - this is how they
[1:02:44] had to apply the blood so now we know I
[1:02:48] just want you to notice this here with a
[1:02:51] blood had to be applied in three places
[1:02:53] the two doorpost
[1:02:54] and the ne and the lintel of the door
[1:02:57] you know it's exactly the same thing
[1:02:59] with us today the blood has to be
[1:03:02] applied in three places I mean it can't
[1:03:05] just be a member where a body is spirit
[1:03:07] and a soul that's the places right you
[1:03:09] can't just many people just apply the
[1:03:11] blood to this to their flesh and they
[1:03:13] get healed and God doesn't work I mean
[1:03:16] but but that's not the final place many
[1:03:18] people also will just allow the blood to
[1:03:21] be applied to this skirt they'll get
[1:03:22] anointed they'll dance they'll shout
[1:03:24] they'll singing yeah you know speaking
[1:03:25] tongues that's good but that's not all
[1:03:27] three places
[1:03:28] all right so set the blood is applied to
[1:03:31] the soul of the person and that's where
[1:03:34] the blood must be applied in the stay I
[1:03:36] mean because remember you can be
[1:03:38] justified without being you know you can
[1:03:41] be justified I'm in both out being
[1:03:44] sanctified without having the Holy Ghost
[1:03:46] otherwise you can be sanctified without
[1:03:48] being justified and not being sealed
[1:03:50] under the kingdom not having the Holy
[1:03:51] Ghost in your soul but you must have all
[1:03:53] three and all three constitute the new
[1:03:55] birth so you can't just have the blood
[1:03:57] applied to your spirit and shout and
[1:03:59] rejoice I mean go to a special meeting
[1:04:00] we'll have a wonderful time in church
[1:04:02] and then go out the same way having the
[1:04:04] same nature that you came and worth I
[1:04:05] mean for anger and malice and strife and
[1:04:08] envy and hatred and you know you're
[1:04:10] tearing people down and assembling
[1:04:12] people and murdering people's influence
[1:04:14] I mean that's an unconverted person we
[1:04:17] don't want to be that kind of way we
[1:04:18] were able to change our nature and our
[1:04:21] nature is only truly changement is a
[1:04:23] birth in the soul and then now the life
[1:04:25] that's in the soul comes forth and takes
[1:04:27] control of the spirit of man that is
[1:04:30] that is where the blood must be applied
[1:04:32] in the soul so not just their bodies I
[1:04:34] mean remember three places it had to be
[1:04:36] applied not just on your flesh not just
[1:04:38] in your spirit I mean but in your on
[1:04:42] your flesh and your spirit and in your
[1:04:44] soul that's where the apply amen now he
[1:04:47] sees he and you shall eat the flesh on
[1:04:50] that night roast it with fire I mean we
[1:04:52] don't want to just eat this you know you
[1:04:54] don't eat it raw I mean not not sudden
[1:04:58] or with water I mean so that's the same
[1:05:00] thing when people take the word they
[1:05:01] they eat the word there's gonna be fire
[1:05:03] there there's gonna be the Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] there I mean the only reality of God
[1:05:07] burning it can be
[1:05:08] sudden just with you you know you're
[1:05:10] full of water I mean uncooked I'm in the
[1:05:12] world alive it's gonna be cooked it's
[1:05:14] gonna be living fire the Holy Ghost in
[1:05:16] the soul in the heart of a person I mean
[1:05:18] when they received the word that's
[1:05:19] that's now the lamb comes in and is
[1:05:21] roasted I mean you can't take the
[1:05:26] message you can't take the Word of God
[1:05:28] in an intellectual standpoint they
[1:05:30] started with water that's not cooked I
[1:05:32] mean that one feeder person then one
[1:05:34] satisfy them but it's when the word is
[1:05:36] mixed with fire with the Holy Ghost at
[1:05:39] hallelujah this is how we must ingest
[1:05:42] the yeah this is how we eat our lamb the
[1:05:45] lamb lamb as the wood of God a mother
[1:05:47] because because the lamb they walked all
[1:05:50] the way into the promised land
[1:05:52] I mean under the TWiT the strength of
[1:05:53] that lamb hallelujah there's a
[1:05:57] supernatural thing I mean so we don't
[1:06:00] just want to eat it amen
[1:06:01] it shouldn't be raw amen
[1:06:05] as you be with water but roasted with
[1:06:07] fire it's hid with its legs and with the
[1:06:10] pertinent parts thereof so don't just
[1:06:11] take out all the nice parts of the word
[1:06:14] that you like you know many people you
[1:06:17] know Paul said Paul said that has a
[1:06:20] shamed of the cross of Christ he was not
[1:06:24] ashamed of it you know many people will
[1:06:27] only take the glorious parts of what
[1:06:28] they consider to be of the scripture you
[1:06:30] know in our days we think Jesus dying on
[1:06:33] the cross it's a glorious thing there's
[1:06:35] no shame in it we think but in reality
[1:06:38] you know if you went back into Paul's
[1:06:41] day and Paul was actually trying to
[1:06:43] witness to someone and someone we are
[1:06:45] you know they weren't a believer that
[1:06:48] say do you tell me that your God became
[1:06:50] a man and he was executed by by yoyoyo
[1:06:55] he was found guilty and the Romans
[1:06:57] crucified him the most shameful death
[1:07:00] anyone could suffer you mean your great
[1:07:02] King of glory who made all things he
[1:07:04] died this way but Paul says I wasn't
[1:07:07] ashamed he wasn't ashamed of that it
[1:07:09] wasn't shamed of that controversy if
[1:07:12] Jesus was born in our day and what is
[1:07:15] what is the what is the death you know
[1:07:18] you know the death penalty is
[1:07:20] administered today by
[1:07:22] Richard she rose by you know your by
[1:07:24] firing squad or hanging or you know
[1:07:26] measured if we sit down
[1:07:27] you know the Messiah came what happened
[1:07:30] to him well he died how did he die he
[1:07:32] was killed by electric chair
[1:07:34] you think hold on this is this has gone
[1:07:37] a bit sideways just like Jesus dying on
[1:07:40] the cross we don't think about their
[1:07:42] approach that that was actually although
[1:07:45] the or the shame that that seemed to
[1:07:47] have but Paul said I'm not ashamed of
[1:07:49] that right
[1:07:51] he didn't just preach the power and the
[1:07:53] glory and the redemption and the and you
[1:07:55] know going to heaven and you know
[1:07:56] healing and casting out the devil he
[1:07:58] said I'm not ashamed of the pertinent
[1:07:59] parts they're off you know so he didn't
[1:08:02] just give the Catlett's and all the nice
[1:08:04] cuts of the lamb but but he gave the
[1:08:06] whole thing yeah he said I'm not shunned
[1:08:08] to declare unto you the full counsel of
[1:08:10] God nor a mean so so we have to take
[1:08:13] even the bits of the word that we don't
[1:08:14] seem to like all you know why do I have
[1:08:16] to eat that but why do we have to maybe
[1:08:18] this with Trish in here and whatever it
[1:08:21] is behind those things I mean so you
[1:08:29] know we just could eat the whole lamb
[1:08:31] the whole Word of God will it'll do you
[1:08:34] good
[1:08:35] any man amen so to eat the hidden hidden
[1:08:40] legs Britain impostor I'll take the
[1:08:42] whole lamb amen
[1:08:43] ace is thus you shall eat it he also
[1:08:47] says with with unleavened bread you to
[1:08:50] get all the living out of your house I
[1:08:52] mean out of all the humble is no but
[1:08:55] this is what we must guard against is
[1:08:56] only what of God and the devil will come
[1:08:59] and suddenly as I said before and he
[1:09:01] would try and get us to doubt put doubt
[1:09:04] on the scripture put doubt on the Word
[1:09:06] of God that's leaven right you do
[1:09:09] unbelief out of your house amen amen

[1:16:58] brother Donnie Reagan's I'm sermon that
[1:17:00] I put on the church what's that he said
[1:17:03] he went to India and and there was a
[1:17:05] widow woman there in India who exactly
[1:17:08] had the same supernatural miracle of God
[1:17:10] God supplying food like the widow woman
[1:17:12] that man you're the meal barrel Giver
[1:17:15] ran out and the cruisers world never
[1:17:17] went dry and it happened exactly the
[1:17:19] same thing till Widow so forgetting you
[1:17:22] know alcohol is still the same God comes
[1:17:36] on the scene it's not in the good times
[1:17:38] yeah at seven when crisis strikes as
[1:17:41] when hardship comes that's when he
[1:17:42] really proves himself it is very easy to
[1:17:45] be in a camp word of convention shouting
[1:17:47] and dancing and floor yeah you know
[1:17:49] heavy a glorious time but God really
[1:17:51] really proves himself when the chips are
[1:17:53] down I mean when trouble strikes when
[1:17:55] sickness comes in yeah that's when God
[1:17:57] proves themselves what is this what is
[1:18:03] this crisis striking the earth it's
[1:18:04] actually God may allowing an opportunity
[1:18:07] to prove himself like never before
[1:18:09] that's right I mean we've never been
[1:18:11] through any of these things before but
[1:18:13] God is not worried God is not
[1:18:17] thing to happen cuz I'm gonna prove
[1:18:18] myself to my children like never when we
[1:18:24] think of being you know you know
[1:18:26] redemption as I've said Redemption must
[1:18:28] come through a man came through God
[1:18:30] becoming a man our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:32] Redemption must be by blood I mean it
[1:18:35] we're being loosed by the blood of Jesus
[1:18:36] cross from our sins but also redemption
[1:18:39] must come by power mmm I just want you
[1:18:42] to think about this for a second now huh
[1:18:44] what kind of power are we how's the mind
[1:18:49] I'm just gonna say a few things it's not
[1:18:51] ah it's not the power it's not the power
[1:18:54] of the mind
[1:18:55] it says not mind over matter we that is
[1:18:57] not the power that we are redeemed by
[1:18:59] yeah we are not redeemed by the power of
[1:19:01] human will yeah this is not some
[1:19:05] self-help you know the gospel is not
[1:19:08] seven steps to overcoming sends away
[1:19:15] makes the people it's not the power of a
[1:19:22] church I mean we are not redeemed by the
[1:19:25] power of a church that's not the it's
[1:19:27] not the church structure that is the
[1:19:29] power for us to be redeemed by we're not
[1:19:31] redeemed by the power of a church we are
[1:19:34] redeemed by the power of God himself
[1:19:38] we are redeemed by as the power of God
[1:19:41] himself member you know he defeated his
[1:19:45] enemy that down Calvary our enemy
[1:19:49] doesn't have the keys to his own house
[1:19:53] now God is now what is he doing now he's
[1:19:57] actually here to manifest the victory he
[1:19:59] won that day in your life we go to
[1:20:03] crisis God wants to prove his power but
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:10] I want to say the power we are redeemed
[1:20:13] by his resurrection power you're
[1:20:17] redeemed by blood we're redeemed by
[1:20:18] power and that power is a resurrection
[1:20:20] power is not just a power that makes us
[1:20:23] to be good church people but that power
[1:20:25] we redeem bias to give us a new body
[1:20:27] holy is it be
[1:20:33] we redeem by you know as brother Baris
[1:20:37] special thing in the later part of his
[1:20:39] ministry he would he would he would
[1:20:41] quote Romans the eighth chapter he says
[1:20:46] of Christ being you remember we're
[1:20:47] facing Easter next weekend he says but
[1:20:50] if Christ being your body is dead
[1:20:51] because of sin but the Spirit of but the
[1:20:54] Spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:20:56] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:20:59] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:21:01] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:21:03] also quicken your mortal bodies yes that
[1:21:07] dwelleth in you so that is the power I
[1:21:09] meant so we're redeemed by power that
[1:21:11] power is a resurrection power your
[1:21:19] message I mean would be put under our
[1:21:22] feet
[1:21:22] hallelujah and these babies would be
[1:21:24] transformed in the moment of the
[1:21:26] twinkling of an eye so we don't redeem
[1:21:30] by a church we're not redeemed by a man
[1:21:32] only I mean but but we're redeemed by
[1:21:34] the power of God and it is resurrection
[1:21:36] hallelujah that's why brother Branham
[1:21:39] you go searching the message is what is
[1:21:42] going on in the same time
[1:21:43] Mahon of the resurrection yes I mean
[1:21:46] just as the Prophet Jonas Jesus says
[1:21:48] would it be in the belly of the whale
[1:21:49] three days and nights I mean so this
[1:21:51] generation shall receive a sign and what
[1:21:54] was the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[1:21:55] resurrection resurrection now this what
[1:21:59] is being done in the church all today is
[1:22:02] the sign of the resurrection where God
[1:22:04] would come down into a redeemed son Oh
[1:22:07] hallelujah and he would speak to that
[1:22:10] redeemed son it's just like you know
[1:22:12] brother Brahim said about Moses he said
[1:22:14] he said Moses was just Moses until the
[1:22:16] Spirit of God came upon him and God
[1:22:18] spoke through him that that was God
[1:22:19] speaking through Moses but then when the
[1:22:21] anointing lifted he was just Moses again
[1:22:23] there brother Ram said I'm just your
[1:22:24] brother but went but I'm waiting for him
[1:22:26] to come angel Lord came down and the
[1:22:29] sign of the resurrection was done again
[1:22:31] the thoughts intents of the hearts were
[1:22:33] revealed addresses were given all kinds
[1:22:35] of things were shown that hallelujah
[1:22:38] basically the same sign that Jesus did
[1:22:40] amen to the woman at the well and
[1:22:42] everyone's
[1:22:43] it was the sign of the resurrection
[1:22:45] right hallelujah so now we're living in
[1:22:47] a resurrection hour why yeah because you
[1:22:50] don't think why was the sign of the
[1:22:51] resurrection done because there's a
[1:22:53] resurrection going to happen I mean is
[1:22:55] that when when that sign was done the
[1:22:57] first time when when I'm God came down
[1:22:59] and spoke to Abraham and Sarah why was
[1:23:03] it done because their bodies had to be
[1:23:05] resurrected had to be made young again
[1:23:07] in order for any of Isaac did in terms
[1:23:13] of they couldn't have children but
[1:23:15] they're well past that age so now they
[1:23:17] had to be brought back to life again
[1:23:19] that they could have children yeah a so
[1:23:22] the sovereign God asked Abraham where
[1:23:24] Sarah thy wife and and and and and and
[1:23:27] Abraham said she's in the team behind
[1:23:29] you and then God said to Abraham
[1:23:30] according to time of life you're gonna
[1:23:32] have the promised son and we know time
[1:23:34] of life always speaks about a woman
[1:23:36] right and then Sarah and the team behind
[1:23:38] God laughs laughs within her heart
[1:23:40] saying how can I have a son on you on
[1:23:42] well past aging my you know you know my
[1:23:45] husband is as well I think I said why
[1:23:47] did Sarah laugh why he knew what she was
[1:23:49] thinking yeah the reason that God did
[1:23:51] that is because God had to come reveal
[1:23:54] himself to Sarah that Sarah would judge
[1:23:56] him faithful where the bride judges and
[1:24:03] faithful that he said is the rapture of
[1:24:09] the church we have to come a little
[1:24:10] place where we believe him and judge him
[1:24:11] faithful God you you are faithful and
[1:24:14] fulfilling your promise to the soul
[1:24:17] resurrection was done they could not
[1:24:22] have children because their past age but
[1:24:24] they they they received new bodies young
[1:24:26] bodies they made young again what
[1:24:28] happened their resurrected in that way
[1:24:30] all my children because was my
[1:24:32] resurrection was done because a
[1:24:34] resurrection was going to happen and
[1:24:36] then Jesus came and that same because
[1:24:38] the same God that that visited Abraham
[1:24:41] there on the plains of Mamre and Genesis
[1:24:43] chapter 18 is the same God that became
[1:24:45] flesh in Jesus Christ and that same sign
[1:24:48] was done through his ministry why
[1:24:49] because a resurrection was going to
[1:24:51] happen I mean so when Jesus arose from
[1:24:53] the grave I mercy as many of the Saints
[1:24:55] that slept there
[1:24:56] with him why there was a resurrection
[1:24:59] hallelujah when when King David would
[1:25:02] you know wrote down in the Psalms lift
[1:25:04] up ye gates
[1:25:05] I mean lift up your heads o ye gates
[1:25:07] yeah yo that the King of glory will come
[1:25:10] in they asked who is the king of glory
[1:25:12] and his response the Lord is the king of
[1:25:15] glory mighty in battle so so what he was
[1:25:18] looking at when he was anointed to write
[1:25:19] that Psalm is here is actually looking
[1:25:21] at the Lord coming out of the grave
[1:25:22] I mean leading leaving the Old Testament
[1:25:25] Saints up into glory that they arose
[1:25:27] with him so now here was David and he
[1:25:29] was pinning down this prophecy but there
[1:25:31] came a time when he manifested that
[1:25:33] prophecy well he would have been
[1:25:35] standing there the Lord you know yo yo
[1:25:37] he arose with the Lord and then they
[1:25:38] went up into glory and he's standing
[1:25:40] before the gates of glory and then he is
[1:25:42] actually part of the voices saying lift
[1:25:44] up ye lift up ye hear ye
[1:25:47] I just like to think that he was singing
[1:25:51] the back of his mind I wrote this down
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:58] but he was living in the fulfillment of
[1:26:00] the prophecy what happened a razor rig
[1:26:04] happened after the sign of the
[1:26:06] resurrection was done hallelujah we come
[1:26:10] to this day the side of the reservoir
[1:26:12] sign of the resurrection was done over
[1:26:14] and over again why because a
[1:26:16] resurrection was coming now was the
[1:26:19] season of the resurrection hallelujah
[1:26:26] also says the sign of the resurrection
[1:26:30] actually the believer becomes the sign
[1:26:31] of the resurrection because we were once
[1:26:34] dead in trespasses and sins right we
[1:26:36] were aliens from God we didn't know him
[1:26:38] we just you know the devil would lead us
[1:26:40] around we did all different kinds of
[1:26:41] things I think God quickened us made us
[1:26:43] alive in him hallelujah so the things
[1:26:46] that once stood we cannot do no more
[1:26:48] because God has changed our nature the
[1:26:50] thing you know we just can't do them
[1:26:51] because you ain't the appetite for them
[1:26:52] anymore he's worthless of all our sins
[1:26:54] and the believer becomes the sign of the
[1:26:57] resurrection to the age I'm looking at
[1:27:02] people all the sign of the resurrection
[1:27:05] being quick and made alive by the holy
[1:27:08] ghost amen
[1:27:10] yes Amen Breezies now what is the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost I mean I mean this isn't the
[1:27:17] message what is the Holy Ghost he says
[1:27:20] today we don't walk by the shadow of the
[1:27:23] law we walk by the power of the
[1:27:25] Resurrection we walk by the power of the
[1:27:28] Spirit who is our true seal our true
[1:27:30] advocate our true comforter our true
[1:27:33] sign that we have been born from above
[1:27:36] peculiar odd people acting funny taking
[1:27:39] God at His Word calling everything else
[1:27:41] wrong God's Word is right oh my that's
[1:27:44] what the Holy Ghost is I mean so do not
[1:27:49] let your hearts be troubled all these
[1:27:52] things must needs be that's right I
[1:27:55] remember Jesus said in the hour you
[1:27:57] think not that's when the Son of Man
[1:27:58] comes oh yes so there's quite a stir in
[1:28:02] the you know in the same time what's
[1:28:04] going on is this when the Beast will
[1:28:06] take over all these things whatever more
[1:28:07] but it's a now you think not so I'll say
[1:28:11] this this thing might just go away
[1:28:14] remember jesus said there'll be pistol
[1:28:16] ins amen a pestilence is an epidemic
[1:28:19] there'll be pestilence earthquakes
[1:28:20] diverse places Wars rumors of wars all
[1:28:23] these things now but it's just the
[1:28:26] beginning of Sorrows so we shouldn't be
[1:28:29] surprised that these things have have
[1:28:31] have come upon the earth we shouldn't be
[1:28:33] surprised we're living in this kind of
[1:28:35] thing but the main thing that we should
[1:28:37] be focused on is are we in Passover are
[1:28:52] we waiting for that final trumpet to
[1:28:54] sound do we have our shoes on our feet
[1:28:56] staff in our hand eating it in haste
