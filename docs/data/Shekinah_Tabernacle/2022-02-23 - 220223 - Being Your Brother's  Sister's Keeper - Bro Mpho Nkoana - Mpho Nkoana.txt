you are the god that specializes in things that are impossible you cross the rivers that are uncrossable father Lord you conquer you overcome Lord things that are impossible to us to you are possible and tonight as we have come Lord God each one of us Lord we brought father God a league of Fire in your presence o God we didn't bring our abilities oh God we didn't bring our capabilities but we brought our Humble Hearts in your presence that you can feel us father and Lord we understand that we are born and shaped in sin we understand that father God we are humans and very limited father and that is why we need the Lord Jesus Christ to uplift us and make us amateur goals tonight and father we are so privileged people tonight to realize that father you chose us you made things that were impossible you loved the people that were unlovable and father you brought us here father even tonight to hear your word Lord I pray my father that you bless the reading of your word the preaching of your word that you break you bless the hearts of your children each one has come here for the god to hear from the Lord may you just provide for them accordingly even as you promise in your word we commit the service and the rest of the evening in your hands tonight by faith in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen greet you once again in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we always get a bit nervous when you come here because it's not a place to actually um uh play jokes and say things that you are not aware or know what you're talking about amen so we just want to thank the Lord thank you so much bent and the musicians thanks for the David for leading the songs that someone was telling us oh I was listening to the service of the memorial of our departed brother Gideon and they say in his first service his brother was telling us that you know in his first service he did like what David did read the scripture and uh started preaching and forgot to let people see that so because when you get here in the pulpit uh it's not an easy place just like when you're standing there it's a very serious place to be in the presence of the Lord and brothers and sisters let's read the scripture before we can go too much in preliminaries let's read the description the Book of Genesis chapter 4. I'm glad to see each one of you and you are more than welcome to be here in the presence of the Living God Amen let's read Genesis chapter 4. and from verse 2 up to verse 9. we are going to do a bit of reading of the scriptures tonight in fact I've got something that I would like to tell the tech guys let's leave this first and sit down I would like to to do something amen are we there if we are there just say Amen so you can see they also just read together and she again bear his brother Abel enable was a keeper of sheep but Kane was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought the of the first Links of his flock and of the FED thereof and the Lord had respect unto the unto able and and to his offer verse 5. but I'm talking and and to his offering he had no respect and Cain was very much Roth and his countenance fell right and the Lord said unto him why are thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou do as well shall thou not be accepted and um accept it and if thou do as well sin if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door right and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him and Cain talked with his brother Abel and and Cain talked with his with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain Rose against him against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is thy brother where is Abel Abel thy brother and he said I know not he just lie I know not am I My Brother's Keeper if you listen to verse two this actually was uh two yeah it says and she bear she again bear his brother Abel this is Eve right and Abel or Abel was a keeper of the ship he was a keeper right he was a keeper but he was keeping life right he was providing life he was a keeper but on the oppos Ed Cain said to God am I My Brother's Keeper so you can already see that these two are not on the same page let's pray Heavenly Father we will never pray enough Lord all I'm trying to do Lord is that you can take over is that Lord you can just bless your weight father as we have read it for we know that your weight is life your weight is yea and amen may you bless it father the whole Bible is eternal life Lord the whole Bible is light it's a promise it tells us the things Lord that we would have not known by ourselves bless your weight father just bless each and every heart that is here may they not hear me Lord but may they hear you father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray with Thanksgiving amen please enjoy the comfort of your seat I presume brother Ben we can read this after prayer is that okay then we can pray together because tonight is a prayer meeting so we won't be long now now what I'm going to do here tonight we want to talk about a little topic here called being your brother's keeper right I forgot I don't have to look back because I can well so this little green square is what is on behind me is that correct so I mustn't worry whether he's there or here okay thank you so much for that so when is green is the one thanks well I want us to speak about a little topic not so little but a topic and a thought that the Lord played on my heart all right and perhaps before we do that is it okay brother Ed I would like to take this mic and another mic if possible if you decide but the other man sorry I couldn't see you I last saw you Brian so I thought you were still bright so so so so this one can go this side so and then you can just leave it in front of the bed and with Brother David here but what we are going to do is that I'm going to before we start I want to ask for I want to ask for adults can I ask for adults volunteers adult volunteers I'm not telling you what you are volunteering for but I'm asking for a first adults volunteers sister Maggie for this side let's start this side Omar Omar stomach Oma just remember yourselves adult volunteers can I volunteer for you sister Tessa right I'll take three from this side Deborah wonderful to see you my girl welcome amen let's come this side I want adult volunteers adult volunteers we're coming Jonah Brother David and then his volunteering for his date Jonah volunteering for his death let's give Brother Andy a chance give my friend a break who can I volunteer for Isaac someone said I always volunteer for her dad I'll volunteer for your mom is that okay assistant I'll volunteer for sister Shannon in that site one more oh they are volunteering for their mom uh or Liam enter sorry children your time shall come okay so these people that has been volunteered or volunteered themselves we are going to read a couple of scriptures tonight um you can share with the one next to you but as I just want to make it a bit participatory because I would like us to follow one another as we go along but the thought of the night you know I've been thinking uh not just to deviate a bit brother Ben I've been thinking with so many Pastors in the lately who has been going on and leaving us I was asking myself what is the Lord actually trying to tell us and a thought came to me that maybe you know I mean I know we are going to be able to know them and see but perhaps these people that are going on who are pastors who are known probably not only in their church but everywhere maybe the Lord is this Resurrection is about to happen and the Lord wants you to know and see those pastors that ah oh pasta you know that could be a possibility the lord gave it to me when I was busy showering and the Lord said ah maybe that could be the reason that the Lord wants us to to know and see them maybe we see a brother somewhere in Chile I may not know him that has gone on but if I see a pastor in Chile who I saw on YouTubers ah that brother they were burying it I remember this pastor maybe I used to follow the services there right so maybe I don't know this is just me I wish it wasn't recorded but now let's come back to our thought being your brothers or sister skipper I would love to to think it like along the lines of saying am I My Brother's Keeper am I My Brother's Keeper or My Sister's Keeper am I am I really dead and I want us again to put another thought on top of that that is which is actually the the gist or the core of what I want us to think about I I understand and I appreciate that on the physical side we can be Keepers and look after for one another that we can give one another we do those things and that's wonderful unbelievers also do that by the way unbelievers look after one another a smoker will never finish a cigarette another one just say to him safe and then he gives him you know what Escape it means just please just give me some little bit and they love one another and he'll suck that cigarette where his brother was sucking without no questions without asking him when did he last have flu or anything like that and he will just suck that cigarette because they look after they keep one another when he gets something he'll call his brother hey I've got some packet can we meet later on tonight the devil teaches them to look for one another on how to take one another to hell he's the best planner below Jesus Christ the devil so the devil and his people they do those things church people they do those things so that is why I want us to go a little bit higher right and think of more the spiritual application what is it that I'm doing for my brother to keep him to be in heaven what is it for me that I'm doing to keep my brother to be delivered from this evil spirit what is it that I'm doing to give him eternal life that's what I'm I want us to think along those lines of course the examples we are going to talk about are much more physical on the physical but let's apply let's put our spiritual jacket as brother Marcus would say Amen now we have read that and we have heard about this man who for the first time him he was offended when he was asked where is your brother and a God knew that if I ask him where is your brother he's going to be offended that is why God asked him where is your brother do you think God did not know God knew even when he was asking them where are thou Adam and if he knew and he knew they were going to lie to him so sometimes children when we ask you we know what you're going to say yeah and your wives and you husbands sometimes your wife will just ask you but he knows that actually this is what you're going to say but anyway let's talk about God God knew that they were going to tell him wrong God knew Adam came was going to say I don't know how rude and how arrogant I don't know okay he even went forth and had the guts to ask God am I My Brother's Keeper because he knew God was asking him why did you not keep your brother he knew God was asking him hey why why didn't you keep and preserve your brother's life huh why were you angry right so we find that the root cause of Cane's Road was not actually did not actually begin when they were born or when they were busy cultivating or other looking after the Sheep it's It came it really the peak of it came when they started to worship and serve God it came when they came in the service of God when they came in church that's why those ones they can escape for one another they can kill one another anytime for them is tea time it's not a problem they are permanently Sinners until we bring gospel to them but you who is in church the moment you start worshiping God and doing God a service that's why the spirit of Cain starts that's why the spirit of Cain begins and then you see your brother with a gift instead of being happy you get rough that's the spirit of Cain there's somewhere in the Bible where the Bible says when you see your brother be happy with him when he gets something happy when he does something good be happy like it's yours there's somewhere in the Bible I've read it where it says why be happy with those who are happy real happy like it's you like I've told you before when I see brother Armand with him what do you call that car Tesla amen I get happy like like I'm gonna drive with him it's almost like my car I get so happy one day my brother I'll get a chance even me because my brother bought that nice car I get happy because I know it's it's it's it's it's it's also I've got a share on that car thank you brother man so the point I'm trying to say here brothers and sisters is that when Abel and Kane started to do a sacrifice for God and then worship God bring things for God that's where problems begun and I want to bring it to you that uh often people will mention things like you know you think you're holy holier than thou mentality if you hear someone asking you you're holier than thou and that that's a cane spirit I'm sorry you cannot say to your brother you are holier than thou appreciate what your brother is doing if you say a good thing if it's a wrong thing help him if it's a good thing happy happy with him right you can't say yeah you know you know the spirit of Cain is like this Abel never said to Cain no no don't do the fruits come come and do the sheep with me he never said that all what ivel did he just sacrificed for God and Abel never said a word he never said a word to offend or to to provoke Cain only God said uh God I like this sacrifice and that was the crime for Abel for what God Said that was the crime for Abraham many times the holier than thou mentality people you don't do anything Uma you you just serve God then they say you think you're holy because they feel wrong and guilty instead of repenting or appreciating you and encouraging you say oh my sister you are inspiring me I'm learning so much from you no no they don't they say she thinks she's holy that's the spirit of Cain what sort of discussions do you have yourself in your private space what what sort of thoughts do you do you engage with the devil regarding your brother or your system when a thought come the Pastor said here there's nothing wrong with the thoughts going flying above us the problem is when they start to stick in here when you start to entertain them now what do you do what what does do you engage the devil about your sister or your brother what can not with other people alone privately in your private space What thoughts am I thinking about my sister or my brother what am I thinking they are or they do it's just a question mark and what what what thoughts and discussion do I engage with God about my brother or my sister do I go before God and and talk about my brother positively before God or I go there trying to say oh Lord just help him the way he is because I'm already judging him and I think God will listen to such attitude but I don't go with sobriety of saying Lord I you know how much I love my brother I'm praying you give me more love for him to pray for him more okay what thoughts because God said very clear I know the thoughts I'm thinking about you I know that I've got the plans for you and it's the thoughts of prosperity it's the thoughts of everything nice but what does to me and you have to discuss with these two persons the devil and God that's the question mark That's part of our introduction in your private space is it the thoughts of bad thoughts or ugly thoughts or inferior thoughts or lesser lesser is lesser or she's lesser than me remember thought speaks powerfully thoughts don't speak like I'm speaking now thoughts thoughts are so powerful the Bible says they actually speak louder before God than our ways their thoughts it didn't say a light thought or heavy thought or what or or lighter thoughts not thoughts the moment I thought a thought is like you know sometimes effort goes through your mind and you don't know it they say we process over sixty thousand is it sixty thousand thoughts a day we process them in our minds my friend likes to preach Brothers India about the subconscious some of them go through the subconscious they only come at night when you are sleeping they pass through your mind and you didn't realize something happened in the spiritual realm and it linked to your thoughts some of them you entertain them some of them just a demon just came landed there to wait for an opportunity and then a thought come and then the devil create a situation that connects with that thought and then you entertain it about your sister or about your brother what kind of thoughts are we ought to be entertaining huh so that's our introduction or or do I in my private space when I talk to God do I think better thoughts good thoughts holy thoughts protective thoughts you know in you know thoughts that uplift my brother or my sister the moment I hear any form of evil I know there's a demon there what do I do until the prophet preached that message and a reaction to an action am I right is there such as someone yes okay let's take the first scripture and then our first volunteer is going to read for us but the first scripture that we want to take is a comparison of David and Saul you remember David so many things we can talk about David pray it please pray a night tonight we won't go long but David when there was an opportunity for him to destroy a soul the person who wanted to destroy him but David on two occasions that I know of saved his life let's read that scripture first Samuel 26 11 to 12. you got this sister Maggie go for it don't don't read faster uh read like you are talking to these people like you are preaching to them you know I know you're not preaching but don't read faster as if you are reading for yourself read like they hear you that it can sink in 11. the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed but I pray they take their now the spear that is at his bolster and the crews of water and let us go so David took the spear and the cruise of water from Saul's bolster and they get them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awake it awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the Lord it deep sleep from the Lord because God wanted to make sure what kind of a keeper is David going to be and David said this is a pure seed of Abel or self this David he said he's the LIE is that line you see what he did there what do you think would have would have happened if so if it was opposite if it was soul because he wanted to kill him anyhow the reason why he was in that thing he was looking for him he was in that cave it's because he was looking for him not to have coffee no no no he was looking for him to have dinner to kill him but David know him very well no wonder the Bible says even the enemy your enemy give him food the one that you know can kill you today the person that you know can kill you bring him in your house put him on the couch and give him food ah the one that can kill me yes that one and that's the message for today if that happened to David and we are in the seven Church eight in an eagle age where we are supposed to be higher and see better are we not supposed to actually be taking a plus we are the a plus group today man we are the A-Class group today brother Ben we are not the the the the the lower grade C down no no no we are top today we are the a plus great and that must happen everything that they did and that the Lord did we are even going to do more things because the Lord promised us that even greater things you are going to do so David could have smashed him he would have killed him I said last time I I left you now is your time be a goner he could have destroyed him but David because he's the keeper of his brother he kept in his mind he had everything of the best about Saul clearly knowing that Saul has got everything to harm him that is against this flesh isn't it it's against the thinking he just that that clearly just separates they keep us in the non-keepers it just shows the line of Cain and the line of good clearly and that's where me and you should come tonight to that point because today is Battle is no more do you know what we call an as a guy [Laughter] sorry I'm half Afrikaans and After High is a sphere thank you Uma almost Yemen I think are you German or Dash over Dutch that's why as a guy it's a spear and spear where you know if sharp one so what did I want to say about that as a guy okay David would have took his as a guy and then destroyed him one time that's what David would have done but he did not do that he preserved him you can see him there can you see it on the picture that man actually told him hey the Lord has given him to you today that man told you what you can go and read it that man told him that David and of course I would have believed him I'm sure I would have believed him and and said yeah you are you are right that's why the Lord made them all sleep that's why the Lord made him and they sleep was from the Lord the Bible says so the Lord made them sleep for me too to finish him that's not the eagle age thinking David said I don't touch them I don't touch the anointed of the Lord knowing very well that this man he's a killer this man he's a promise breaker this man he's everything bad but he says he's the anointed of the Lord knowing that my brother yesterday was angry and swearing at me and I say this is the son of the most high God yes yes we must be opposite the thinking of this world when the devil goes this way we go that way when the devil go that way we go always go opposite praise God's children even if you see them doing wrong don't break them amen that's what David did it's not for David to judge Saul right it's not for me to judge you or to be judged by you no no it's not for me or for you our job is to bring to give eternal life our job is to because we'll see as we go along what the prophet says let's jump to another example you pass on the my gear or do you want us to go this side my sister um we continue with the next speaker almost ready then we are looking at the next example can you see it that is example of Abraham many examples he was his brother's keeper until he left with him when God told him you I'm saying You must go and he takes Lord because inside his nature is of a keeper he wants to keep the best thing the Lord has called me so surely the Lord won't have a problem my brother if you come with me you know what that was not what the Lord wanted but he said he's got the nature of God God would have stopped him if he wanted him he'd have stopped him and say hey I'm saying you and Sarah I never said Lord but he still because he's got the nature of God and God allowed him practice what he's best what he is and later on God separated them because in any case initially God wanted only him are we together so what did he do if all married for us Genesis 13. from verse 8. and Ibraham said unto lot late there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou Wilt take the left hand then I will go to the right or if they'll depart to the right hand then I will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of Jordan that was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto zoah then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other just listen to that attitude thank you Uma listen to the attitude of a keeper he he he doesn't put himself first he says Lord I understand it he didn't take he didn't say this but this is what you can see Abraham knew that he's senior he's his uncle in our culture the small one don't choose first before the big hour you know first bondsman's always choose first sorry about about that attitude of Facebook first ones okay the Elder one chooses first you can't let Talia choose first before Tiana you can't ah now Abraham also knew that it is not Lord who God called him it is him and Abraham knew also that he also needs green grass for his heads he knew all these things but what did Abraham say he said if you go to the left let's not fight for we are brethren probably the the guise of Lord are the ones who started I'll find out when I get there I think they started why why Lord the spirit or the spirit of us wanting to have everything you can see it now when they are their owner chooses he's looking at the Green River and everything you can see it that could have been the spirit that was on the Saints and his family he was better and best God calls Abraham and Lord wants to take now he looks he said man what a lovely man he said okay I must choose first or thank you he doesn't say no never Uncle no ways he doesn't say that he doesn't say uncle I can I was never called by God I'm not a prophet you go in fact you tell me where to go that's what Lord's attitude should have been then him he said ah yeah thank you Uncle and then he said like this you know those proud people brother and he told us about right he said yeah this thing is worrying me Uncle anyway you should be choosing but I'll choose anyway I'll choose you know with pride I'll choose and go and he's looking it's just that your guys are actually wrong it's going on and on and on then eventually as he's looking don't know how many days Abraham gave him two shoes he must have given he was an adjustment he chose the best location even to the Garden of God like Egypt the Bible says he chose that best and that was Sodom and Gomorrah towards the east towards his Road LED towards Sodom okay okay and Abraham said okay sure I'll take I'll take this side if you take the East obviously Abraham took the West because the gospel moved from the East to the right so he went to that West didn't you hear he said if you just left I choose right if you should so able to help myself gone to the West that is why today even the brother brother said I've got a yearning to go to the West is the end so she's off my boy who's there oh it's outside sorry I thought it's one of my children sorry about that I thought it was you Jonah now Shalom team goodbye go to the east then he took the less apart or what appeared to be lesser and a little did Lord realize that what is not good in your eyes is good in the eyes of the Lord surely God will even tend that desert for Abraham into a magnificent career Hallelujah do you understand what I'm trying to get it now do you always want to take first do you always wants to bless you yourself first When you pray when you think you always want you know the more you bless other people first it come it will come to pass that you get blessed before you even mention your name he said in the scripture even before you ask I will answer you so do not waste time praying for yourself first I'm not saying don't pray for yourself but please cry really for your brother and your sister best priority let's go forward I think we can pass the mic next door sorry we okay let's finish this Row first hopefully there will be more scriptures for you to read if finished next time you'll be like the kiss who's honest volunteer we're going to read sister test um Matthew 26. and we are looking at the story of uh I think is Judas in Jesus Matthew 26. start from 48 yes yes please 48. you got it yeah now now that we betrayed yeah yeah that one now that he betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomever I shall kiss that same is he hold him fast you you yeah he's called colludas yeah the one that I'm going to kiss a kiss is a beautiful thing you you you you you you you Embrace someone he's saying the one that I'm going to kiss Judas conniving go on my sister and for where they came to Jesus and said hell master and kissed him Jesus said unto him friend where wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and look at them look at these two characters he is coming to destroy him what does Jesus say to him Fred of all things friend I was gonna say what do you want now yes finish I'm dying anyway probably many of us would have been overtaken by emotions God forbid I wouldn't I shouldn't have done that but Jesus said friend and I believe he meant it there's foolish people sorry to mention that way but with this attitude that says no Jesus was sarcastic it was not a sarcastic he meant it he meant all poor thing friend come are you ready to come do your thing who are The Seekers who are you seeking I'm here my dear friend he meant friend you'll see now and okay so that is if you are okay you can pass it to next one to finish off the other 51 and 52 if you are okay unless you want to eat it up and behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant at the high priest to smote off his ear then said Jesus on to him put up against thy sword into his his place for all they that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword what they keep up what day keeper is he then one from his was on Camp the one who's not even a betrayer Peter he slashes the ear quickly it was him he's fighting a physical one because he said oh my friend we keep we don't kill we are the keepers of our brothers we don't cut we don't cut their ears stop him pick up the ear and he puts it and he then preached that you know Peter in that sermon that sermon should have struck home he told him he who the way that you slash your brother with a sword remember that be very careful the way you think about your brother the way you conclude the way you go on and on and on you and the devil or the way that you bless your brother you go on and on and bless him uplift him that way that's gonna be your destiny of eternal life there's no other way you say law of how things work the tree falls to the side where it is leaning you bless you get blessed you cares that's that's what the Lord says here he's saying you're telling him he says remember that then Jesus said Jesus said then said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword he was reprimanding Peter into his place for all they that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword well silly he was telling him even for future and Peter got it later on until they crucified him Peter would have fought a feather later on but no no that time he got it it was revealed for him so bless more bless hundred percent yeah then you are a keeper you are of the opposite of Cain if you do that you're gonna jump to the next example let's go this side let's start from the back my friend you'll be the finisher that was there there so we take an example of the the prodigal son and his brother I just want to show you these three examples brothers and sisters so that we can put our spiritual jacket and apply them to our life today on more of spiritual things your brother come from the world from drinking from doing all sorts of things and you saw him and you had him how is your attitude towards him how is your attitude to your sister or your brother about the things that he or she gave you as a testimony and you start to allow the devil to think like about him that way or about her when their testimony was about praising God let's hear a man in the church a man in the ministry you'll hear now where he was this man he was preaching in the field let's read it to Mama Landing Luke 15 25-29 now his eldest son was in the field and as he came and draw night to the house he heard music and dancing hold on a second where was he wishing this man he was working hard denominational or chairs whatever Pentecost about he was a Domini [Laughter] you are the minister and then he come he hear this noise of dancing say man this people government men in the Church of the Living God what are they doing remember brother Branham did the same so that girl dancing in the spirit of the Lord and density Prophet said ah this girl come on David they blamed you ah now if you can't dance that brother and you don't don't criticize you okay if you can't dance like him at least go to him to teach you his step how he does it no one who deals like brother in if you don't know don't criticize him can I say my brother I want to be in Symphony with you how how do I do it so because the moment the moment you go negative you open up for the Devil the slightest smallest thought in the presence of God brings a big devil not a small devil so there's the the the the the sanctuary as we get in the presence of God is supposed to be so sober so sober just like when you come to preach you must be so sober so silver that I'm thinking of no one I I must be muted the minister must be muted and let God the moment I I'm preaching about Ben I must sit there I'm not fit to stand here and God will punish me for that I must be sober and clueless let the spirit of God speak that's how a minister should be right and now this man he hears the music there is a jubilee in the house that is dancing and happiness and he comes with my sister from verse 26. and he called one of his servants and asked what these things made and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and entreated him and he answering said to his father love these many years do I serve thee neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment and yet though never gave us me a kid that I might make Mary with my friends can you hear that denominationalist spirit who are you your brand name is who you just come now you know the church started in Asia Council we have been in this business for long we have found many denominations who are you to start it yesterday you didn't even go to a Bible School who are you and that's what that man is saying we have been you know you know we go to these churches like the one that mokoma called us the the church in the church you see this is Justice these people are along and everything is organized even the walls the tiles on the the churches are you know they they have been far long in this business they know how to change and how to build their church and how to be you know and then when they read everything is organized and there's someone Hallelujah everything is organized they are church people they know how then you come here and you say you are going to be telling us to bring life you're going to impart eternal life who are you hey this man for many years he's asking the father he the Bible says it he entreated his father I don't know what's the meaning of that we didn't treated Andy what does it mean David to intake you know and I'm sure he was talking serious business he called his father to a meeting but no ways this doesn't work this way for how long did I save you and I never transgressed against you isn't it fair in New Zealand we say fair enough fair enough yeah fair enough what this man is asking but this man is the eyesight is limited so little to where he can see about the riches about the wrongs of his brother he can't see eternal life you can see beyond what his father can see Beyond see over see what God sees about your brother see what God sees understand about your sister and your brother what God understands about them are we together so that is the story of this wonderful man who did everything to the letter and he forgot that the letter killeth he forgot he is supposed to be a life preserver I don't know what was he going to do if the report came home and they said your brother has died in the uh swine pen they found him dead for three days and he was rotten so he was even gonna say he must not be buried here he must be buried there that's attitude he must not even be brought here what do you think that he must not be that boy he's careless he must be buried there with the pigs he mustn't be brought here too his cop does not belong to be buried on our ground that's what this man was gonna say if he the report came home that your brother who taken all his riches and he went away we had a report that he was butchered by the criminals after he finished all the money they took some of the money they killed him and he was in sin he died in sin this man was gonna be happy is that what me and you are supposed to be today we are supposed to be very happy See Beyond my brother's faults see beyond the perceived because remember everything that the devil is blaming you it's just perception it's not reality everything that the devil you think the Devil Makes you to do that and you blame yourself as brother Ben always say is him he make you to blame yourself he questions and make you to blame yourself and then saves you that's what he does so we're gonna close with the last scripture and what did I say I did it you're gonna allow mom because it's the last scripture sorry baby next time we're gonna read the next example let's go oh yeah there's two of them sorry yeah you can have a chance let's go for the one first on the right sister Shannon Genesis 37 27. to 28 this is now the story about another keeper called Joseph he was a lovely keeper he was a he was not a destroyer was a Giver of Life he was doing opposite cane let's hear about his brothers first I I decided to put them together let's hear about Genesis 37 27. 27 yep Come and Let Us sell him to the is ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content then they're passed by midianites merchantment and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt oh yeah thank you so much did you hear that kind of a reasoning they they they went to sugarcoat they are conscious they said Remember the boy is in the pit he suffered in the weather is bitten by a Mamba whether it's broken on his leg fractured his spine they just threw him there they don't care but now they say ah because it's our brother they knew he's their brother but no no no guys let's make our eyes comfortable because it's our blood let's let's tell him so that because it's our flesh it's flesh of our flesh but no no let's not save him I thought they would say ah because it's our brother no no no guys let's repent man this guy let's take him out so how can you say the Flesh of your flesh you're not taking him out to save him you'd rather sell him for why are you selling him so that your conscious can be bad that's the reason why night did you see them that they sell him in Chains go why they do that why why they don't just leave him die in there they want to comfort their conscious their guilt they want to say oh yeah no no he didn't die out of our hands think who are they fooling who are they fully now let's go to the last scripture the Genesis 45 let's hear about the keeper of life our identity our represent our forefather you and me let's hear what him what what does he say when the same people who would have killed him let's hear what he said Genesis 45 3-5 and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am Joseph doth my father yet love and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me let us listen to that come near what you I mean is that real Is that real this is out of this world man this is out of this world this is the keeper of his brother read on my brother and like I'm near and he said I am Joyce of you brother whom he is sold into Egypt now therefore be not grave nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me Heather for God did send me before you to preserve life I'm so blessed by the story of Joseph I'm so blessed by the story of Joseph because not even a drop of anger when he reminds them of what they did he's telling them instead no no what you did was all right Is that real brother Isaac what you did was alrighty to sell me yeah yeah you know a child of God take the things that his brother does and he lift him up with those things he doesn't say Yaya I know you are bad man no no no it's just no my friend you know that was to give God the glory wow yeah what matters is now because me and Andy we say we saved the now God what matters is now not what you did not what I did we served there now what matters he saved you now that man that we spoke about previously instead of saying what matters is that my brother is back he says no no no no no no no no no he took his riches yeah can you see the difference yeah yeah Joseph he says come come closer to me amen I mean that that was that was the most powerful backslaughter I've ever come across have you ever felt it if you want to give someone a real Pakistan don't revenge on them treat them well and leave the rest to God a sensible person will repent and feel pain because that's very painful backsla you do me bad and I come to you I say come the bed for you the food for you and yeah you can take my car I'll take a bus to the station use my car then and then I can I'll take your bus because the bastard stops my destination you take my car and use it but yesterday you you wanted to shoot me that's what Joseph did yeah and all these things that we are talking about I would like us to take them and convert them to the spiritual Realm what are those things that I am doing to lift up my brother spiritually to make sure that I help my brother and my sister to see Jesus to be in heaven what is it that I'm doing I'm thinking about my life daily eternal life is living for others how do we do that now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent off for others that's perfect that's perfectly eternal life so if I do all spiritual good things and bring people you know in Daniel chapter 12. you say those that led many to righteousness will shine like stars on that day you know that scripture so so eternal life is living for others forget about yourself and here I'm talking about a spiritual life it's all right to give me a suit I love it that's what we must do and believers do that but we are we go a little higher eternal life is living for others what my life my life must be so salty that it can lead people into heaven when I leave when I talk you know yesterday a customer sweat at me so much until my team member came to me and said are you okay Samson you know that I found out that that team member her name was Grace [Laughter] except to me to the call I said yes you know in the morning meetings you know we've got this commentary when someone did something you go and send a message a feedback to the whole company for everybody to see what happened and how so she sent that message unbeknown to me how I handled that man until at the end of the call that man apologized and cried to me and and the lady the lady's name is Grace so so we we need to be able to to live our life until people come and ask Ben how do you do it how do you live like this man I remember we used to dance together but tell me how do you change like this what make you change you say you say to them come and see that's how we must live our lives when those that know me that I used to run around and do all sorts of rubbish when they see me standing here they say ah is that then I say yes I must live my life to a point where it can take people into heaven it can make people to want to love Jesus to want to associate with Jesus it must be an oasis my life giving life to people I'm finishing when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life you have not I'd like to put each other that way you have not heaven is not it's not it's just like I jump it's like I jumped the weight not eternal life is living for others it it proved it when it came in the lamp of God he took his life and gave it to us and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others hmm that's what eternal life is and I would like to say to you not is one thing to and I would like to re-emphasize is one thing to give people all the wonderful things that are suffering and give them food and share with them that is scriptural we must do that but we've passed that that is like year eight which is good you cannot go to irritating without passing Aid that is necessary but we are now past year 13. we are now astronauts we are no more taking off like an airplane we are astronomical isn't it we are now flying beyond the ozone if you if there's something like that we are in the solar system now where nobody can be we are orbiting with the planets where the space only spaceships can go where if anyone go there you die because there's no Oxygen for you there there there's only connection of of heavenly oxygen only and you have to have the right pipe to connect if you are there you'll die yeah yeah you can't fly there if you are not in the relevant suit space suit and everything you'll die so when they go there beyond the skies beyond all in space you know they have got oxygen connect they don't breathe oxygen over here when they are there no they don't breathe oxygen of Earth they are too far from Earth isn't it they've got their own little tanks of oxygen and we saw them there on the movement okay pumping on the on on air you know when you are a Believer astronomical you you walk on air that's what they do I'm strong in them right didn't you see them even though they say is hoax but but at least we've had an idea the drama test is so well at least we have an idea of how to walk on air you know we saw them with oxygen they that's a type of who we are we are way above that us we live for others we die for others come to a point where you can be ready to take a bullet for your brother who thought about that protecting my back and you know if I get shot I'm taking a shot for you boy you make sure that you take right that's what we do to take a bullet for real can you take a blame for your brother I think that's part of what I'm talking about huh say I don't know brother leave it on me I like brothers when we go for for meals they say our brothers on me I like that kind of Brothers now listen to this as we finish listen to this do something good for someone if you want God if you want to do something for God huh if you want to do something for God do something for his people if you want something good said about you you say something good about someone else bless so someone else and you as you are blessing someone else you are blessing God for Jesus said in so much as you have done unto this list of this my little ones you have done unto me so we know that that's the truth so may the Lord Jesus bless us tonight now as we read his weight you cannot want to be blessed when you are not blessing others and the promise is if you bless others you are going to be blessed in God you just jump in in a in a bowl of the cream of God you're in there just by blessing people you find yourself swimming inside the cream of God's blessings and you don't know which way to eat isn't that lovely just by simply blessing God's people protecting them ensuring that they are well that their spiritual well-being is well wonderful physical well-being spiritual well-being get worried if you don't see your brother in church find out hey my brother I didn't see you in church today are you okay I've been praying for you man even if you're not telling him in your private space you are your brother's keeper do that so we are taking it with a spiritual application I want to put it to a spiritual application now this code you see everyone even all the denominations I've already mentioned this all the unbelievers they can do all good things they can do nice things to everyone and much more there's no one who can be a philanthropist more than Bill Gates they do those things they give billions for for Mahala there I read somewhere where Warren Buffett said oh no no I don't need six piece I just want one bit at a time I need one car at a time and I need one house at a time what do I do with six base because I can't sleep on them at once that was the richest man one of the richest people he said that those those third statement but let's get a little bit higher our spiritual actions I'm talking more about spiritual activities and I'm talking more not things that you do in a group to be seen as an individual in your private space in your private thinking capacities alone are you keeping your brother in that space that's what I'm talking about tonight be a keeper amen this light is cut there I'll read it here is it okay even there is cut now I'll try to okay and you people with this so so blade tempers that always spout you off in the mouth and then what does he say there and the body cut they cannot no someone can't shut up and things like that be careful he's talking about people who cut others into pieces be careful be careful you are guilty if you speak a word against your brother that is not right not just go around and tear down you don't have you don't have uh to start a knife in a man's back to kill him no you don't have to do take a knife and kill him just by talking just by thinking wrong about your sister and your brother you're equally killing him you're mentoring him his brother Brennan preaching to us as the Eagles and we know we are just being refreshened to be reminded we are we are not even to be counted among those supposedly right we are teaching and reminding ourselves and teaching our children to know that we give the other chick it's not easy but for a Believer it's easy right you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you are just ask if you shot him what do you think about your pastor Tara he's got weakness here here you think like like that you're not you're not you're not the keeper of your pastor if you do that your brother your Deacon your sister your brother and your your your sister I don't know who else your Young Brother your cousin if you think like that you are just like shooting him shooting him is even better because he'll die physically and then I can say uh hey I'm sorry man then God maybe forgives me but now this one I'm killing here even killing his influence the whole world will know him as a dead person everybody will know that one he say oh he killed you that's what the prophet says let that not be found Among Us not let it not even be heard or spoken among us because we are the keepers am I a keeper of my brother tonight let's let's leave it here tonight but I want to leave it here maybe by reading for you just these last two scriptures that's did you read David oh you're right give someone else or one more child volunteer you okay give Liam will you see boy will you be able to see I want you to read that that first scripture I think that scripture is a that's Matthew hey I don't know what happened to my scripture that's Matthew 25. huh oh sorry Matthew 5. can you see Liam yeah read that one for us don't read fast I want everyone to hear it a unto you that what that whosoever that whatever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say unto his brother Rucker and be danger of the council but who whosoever shall say thou full be in danger of Hell Fire we hear that never say to someone stupid or raka or whatever because you will be in danger of Hell Fire never I cannot over emphasize last person I think Debbie raised a hand decide was it you Debbie or who was it huh sorry I volunteered for you then read that one Michael sorry about my presentation tonight I don't know what happened there a I must have done it from Samsung and this is Apple [Laughter] so read for me that last chapter that last verse and then we go home can you see that one what is it brother Ed that last scripture is a h Romance I think it's Romance yeah I think it's Romans 14 I'm sorry here I don't see and it's affecting them is it thank you and everyone read that one my my girl Romans 14 I can read it for you if you can so then everyone every one of us shall give account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a strong a stumbling block or an occasion to fallen in his brother's way I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to to be unclean to him it is unclean But If thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walk us thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died huh that last part not then you're good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God does not meet and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost see this is the spiritual part now can you see the things that matters is not meat suit oh you didn't call me oh no no you never invited me or you invited me oh no you never called me for Auntie Mario oh you called David the kingdom of God is not for Sagittarius or meat no I don't eat chicken I eat fish no no that's not the things of the kingdom of God and that's what the things that we offend one another with useless things brother Isaac said those things don't matter yeah whether I wear a purple shirt like my brother today or is that Pingo people or I wear a blue one it does not matter the point I'm trying to say brothers and sisters is that if that is an issue for me I must bring it to the Lord in prayer seriously so because I believe he's serious and my brother is in the wrong it's time for me to kneel down it's time for me to cry until I win my brother until that thing changes until my brother can connect to my energy I was gonna speak about sound and energy tonight but the Lord said I'm not done with that same one I was gonna talk about sound and energy I was so blessed on Sunday when the Pastor said you know you know the sound has got waves I almost jumped off of the roof so brothers and sisters there are things that matters and there are things that doesn't matter Kane should have repented he killed his brother for nothing simply because he was too proud he was too angry he was too jealousy he was too hatred full or whatever the name is he had hatred and Abel did nothing wrong he did nothing wrong brother and he killed him for nothing he destroyed his character and he killed him and God said ah I'm warning you sin is waiting for you and you can control it but you can take it can win you if you are not careful he was given a chance God is such a keeper he even wanted to give Kane a chance knowing very well that he is the son of the devil he still want to say again you can repent man I can accommodate you just believe in me and he came and said no I don't know what you're talking about I don't know what I did to my brother you don't know what that's what he says I don't know what I did to my brother he was so rude amen may the Lord bless you tonight brothers and sisters the purpose of this sermon is not to try to get on you or reprimand you the purpose is that as a family we need to come sometimes and be friends with one another and talk about these things and encourage there will come a time when the pastor will come and teach us and and teach us about you know Heavy Deep things and we learn there's teachers among us but sometimes this you know I like talking about the Loose Ends sometimes those must be cut must give life to one another who must promote one another who must lift up one another beyond what the flesh can think that's our thinking and God bless you tonight it's my prayer may the Lord bless each one of you and we are going to pray and you want to stand up and stretch your feet or you'd like to sit down okay musicians can come I believe musicians can come and then we're going to read the prayer requests and then we will we will pray

seen how the Lord protected brother Ben and Brother Andy we have seen how the Lord protected the brothers ministering in Papua New Guinea in Vietnam and everywhere we have seen the Lord doing that they are going there for a mission and the devil does not like it so we want to pray for that trip tonight we're thinking over the George Martin's Family and the fellowship over there for comfort and for guidance we're praying for brother Gideon's families sister Kathy and the family and the grandchildren and everyone and the church and the fellowship there for comfort and for guidance when they
