all our spirits with all our minds lord we come lord after a day of work and different activities in the evening time we come father here is your people lord they have left everything that they could have done they have come into your presence not to listen to me father but to hear from thee and i pray my master my god that you can put me aside lord remove my personality remove my little words remove my mind remove anything that i think i can prepare or plan let it be you who will speak father as we come tonight my father my god we wanna submit ourselves and be humble in your presence lord we want to ask you to forgive us our trespasses forgive our weaknesses forgive our shortcomings lord as we come in worship lord lord may we be able to worship you without anything between us and you and we pray father god for the moving of the holy spirit let nothing be between us and christ jesus and i pray father that you'll bless your word that you'll bless your people that each and everyone lord who is fellowshipping in this service tonight will go back home not the same person for we know that your word father will never go out and come back to you void we know that your word is so powerful lord if it finds a heart it changes it lord and i pray that you do the same to your beloved children tonight lord those also who are on on a virtual uh service father maybe on zoom or youtube may you bless them too they are part of the service also i pray holy spirit that you also go there in the house in the room that you go through that internet and that computer my father that your holy spirit lord that you can be the same atmosphere that is here we are inviting you lord we know that you have been here long before each one you kept your appointment lord and we just want to welcome you in our hearts remove every disturbance every spirit that may come to counter your word we remove every antichrist spirit that may want to disturb the flow of the spirit we bind it father in the name of our lord jesus christ for that is the name given to us lord god in which we can cast demons that is the name that is only name that is powerful to bind satan and tonight we believe lord in that name we take it and we bind satan for we know that when your children shall begin to pray miracles are duty bound to happen and i pray dear lord that you do the same as you promised that where two or three i gathered in my name i will be there in your midst father we humble ourselves now lord god bless these hearts really bless them father that when they when they leave here at least for the god they would have received that wish you prepared for them i ask this father god in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you believe us i greet you all tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ amen once again we meet in his presence and as you all know bradampu is not a preacher that one you know by now but i'm just here to share with you what the lord has put in my heart as the as as we are helping our the ministry as we are helping and trying to bring the last few souls to the lord as we are trying to keep maintaining the atmosphere in our lives of the of the word of god so we are there as fellow laborers as fellow ministers to support those that support our economy and those people are you those people are me those people are anyone who could be listening anywhere amen so that's what we are here for for that course to encourage one another to motivate one another to remind one another to encourage one another a man to keep on bringing the reflection of actually who you are amen and on that basis i just want to uh greet you in the presence of the lord and say good evening friends and i don't have much to give you only the lord will give you said let me just set up my watch because i've got a tendency then i'll take this opportunity to thank the musicians with all jurisdict thank you so much for creating the atmosphere and thank you for making time to come here and use your gifts and use your time to be fellow laborers in the ministry god bless you i think you can enjoy your seats while i remain here alone amen and then we are going to read in the book of psalm chapter one but before we go there the brothers can just help me by displaying the very first slide then we we're going to read in the book of psalm chapter one um okay but before we read i just wanna i just want to express thanksgiving to the lord and tell him that i love him and i appreciate him with all my heart and there's no one like him there's no one like him i don't know how to tell him the more i talk about him the more i think about him the more i realized that he loved me and the more i realized who i am the more i realized how sinful how muddy how dirty i was because the closer you get to the lord the brighter it gets and you seen even a little peace drop of death cannot stand in the presence of the living god so i just wanna tell you that you are doing the same tonight amen so that that little slide there that is a piece of salt it's a little rock a little stone of salt it's very salty that one is a piece of salt what is that one little children sorry my voice is already running away and uh that is a piece of sword and i want to just before we start maybe you can sit a little bit okay i'm sorry we will stand up now but let's just sit for a second sorry about that i apologize sort of this i'm sort of disorganized you forgive me thank you so much i just want to mention not to i don't want to be funny but that piece of soul that you see there and it's very salty and i love it very much because it's salty it's doing its job and i want you to understand that salt is meant to salt i'm thankful for the service the preaching of the weight on sunday i wish i can just sit down i told brother ben i said brother man i don't know what to tell you but i want to sit down on wednesday i wish you can just continue to preach because the word spoke to my heart so deeply no i don't know about you but it came to me so much so that you know crying was not enough i didn't know what to tell the lord how i thank him for what has gone out on sunday so i just want to tell brother ben that i appreciate you my brother and may the lord bless you richly and may the lord really brothers and sisters let's hold up his hands because when god calls a man he doesn't let them let him astray and god uses you to hold his hands look to the ministry look for the calling not anything else look to the calling because god has called a man among us to help you you'll never be able to the prophet says you know the pastor is the angel of the church he says that the prophet he's the shepherd of the church you need to look at it through the spiritual eyes amen so i really appreciate you my brother for just forgiving yourself for availing yourself for letting god uses you to benefit me uh how many how many appreciate brother ben so that little sword is brother band that one is for the bed [Laughter] so that's how much we appreciate you brother ben we appreciate jesus christ in you my brother that's how much i want to tell you not not to you know soul to never uplift itself it's just salt so whether you went to pour water on it whether you want to do what if it's if his salt is sold and that's him um after the lord jesus christ if you want to have a role model that's your one old or young look at the jesus christ in his life so i just want to tell you that i love you my brother and i just want to thank god for uh allowing our parts to to cross because it's for his purpose and for his glory so okay that part of the service is done i want you to i wanted to tell you to refresh your mind that don't look at the man look at the jesus christ in the man look at the character look at the operation of the spirit look carefully because one day the lord jesus said to them an adulterous generation secret after a sign but there is a sign among them they can't see it we've seen different things may god help us to see that sign that miracle that god has given us hallelujah amen we're going to read psalm chapter one please stand with respect sorry sister megan thank you so much for that testimony god bless your heart my sister that was quite moving for me um let's read the word of god first if you are there just say amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly no standeth in the way of sinners nor seated in the seat of the sculpture blessed is the man that blessed that is the man that walketh i want you to underline that weight blessed is the man that worketh to walk blessed is that man who walketh and not in the counsel of the sinners there's two but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law that he meditate day end you know i like people who participate when i say day and you say night then we are together to meditate about god's law god's word day and night all right verse 3 and he shall be that man or that woman shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season this one who does not work in the council of the of the of the sinners on the scornful and them uh who meditate about the word of god day and night he is like the tree that is planted by the rivers of the water that bring us fruit fruit underline that word bring it fruit those two ways bring it fruit you walk right you meditate right you bring it fruit are we together i want you to sit down but let me just finish that vestry that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his life also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it whatsoever who knows the meaning of the word whatsoever whatsoever he do it shall prosper and brother john do you wanna just bless pray for us and bless the word of god by prayer let's pray together yes my father my god yes lord jesus hallelujah yes my lord let us grasp it further thank you my god blessed be his holy name please enjoy the comfort of your sis thanks brother john amen we are going to talk tonight about somehow these classes are they are they are wrong i can't see properly i don't know for some of the enemies just fighting probably and uh that's what we are going to speak about tonight we are going to speak about walking alone with jesus walking alone with jesus hallelujah thank you that's what we are going to speak about and then we i'd like her to take a side that i always hear ministers saying there's a title and there's a subject so today i thought i can copy them it's not like i want to try to be that minister but i thought ah i'm sure not that dream is excellent you know so i thought about it and i thought ah maybe i can edit you know and have a subject line in other words the thought line right in other words the line of thought the line of thought is creating an atmosphere daily creating an atmosphere daily why inside outside everywhere that's what you're going to speak about while you are working with the lord while you are working alone because working with jesus is not a group thing working with the lord is not a mother mama papa brother of course it is for them but also on an individual basis that is why brother and sister so many have died that is why so many families have gone apart that is why so many friends have separated so many have died so many are alive because the word of god is a separator can i show you the word of god is a unifier at the same time because it's not a group work what does that mean what that what what what what that means is that we don't come to the lord because and my friends are there we don't come to the lord because oh my dad no no we even though they can influence us and inspire us which is wonderful we want that but there must come a point in my individual work where i experience a work with god because when i get there my mother my sister my brother my daughter my friend won't be there brother john to be me i walk alone but with jesus this reminds me of the same one brother john and this priest that we are alone but together how many remembers that same one alone but together so that's what we are going to try to drive a line of thought tonight just relax but fasten your seat belts as we go along and relax in the presence of the lord just follow the thought and i've got lots of calls that have put here from the prophet but really this was sitting on my heart and i didn't know how to express it and i said my it means walking it's not just walking you know when we say walking is that we say life is a journey am i right we say life is a journey was teasing someone not my wife i was teasing someone who said hey you know i'm i'm starting a journey for dieting but that's not my wife i'm telling you the truth i wasn't teasing my wife because if i tease her i'm teasing myself so i said oh you're starting a journey which means a journey is not only when you get in your car and drive which means the journey is not when you just walk with your feet life itself is a journey we took a journey from before it turned it from before the creation we we came here and we are still on a journey what are we doing we are walking we are king we jesus you know that's all walking every day all along the way whoa king we did us walking with jesus alone it says sometimes in the sunshine sometimes in the shadows walking every day all along the way that's what the song says so we are working with jesus but alone sometimes in the sunshine sometimes in the shadows now i just want to start off by giving you a short testimony of myself and another brother friend of mine brother wilson down in cape town uh many years ago we were going for a a wedding and a funeral it was like a holiday of a friday coming and then we were traveling the night the first day and a brother who used to work at the airport booked the flies for us and because he was working for south african airways he booked for us but because he's an employee they they don't charge him much but at the same time you you don't get priority even if you booked you sit at the back of the queue you may come in you may not come in you paid cheap isn't it people have paid full price so he booked for us and then we're on our way to johannesburg we went to the airport we were on the line for the flights were overbooked three flies were remaining and then i just cut the story short quickly and then we were going for a funeral of a brother who died on the saturday and we are also going for a wedding of a friend of mine where i was supposed to speak on the friday that's why we leave thursday are we together so we left to the airport captain international airport and we wait on the list we were i was number 24 he was number 25 and the flies are overbooked we waited first flight that we were supposed to go in it was too full he left two flights left second flight although also two full a few went in there the list was too long we didn't make it now there was a last flight which was about quarter to 11. last one they gave us all our tickets they gave us all whatever we need to do they give us all our luggage they say hey the flight is over booked even number one cannot manage to come in the one on the list remember on the waiting list so go home tomorrow 6 o'clock be here the first flight maybe you'll go tomorrow i'm supposed to be speaking at the wedding two hours from johannesburg to cape town from there we must drive three hours to the wedding how can i be at six o'clock at the airport for the mario so me and brother wilson we were sitting there and then they gave everybody everything and everyone really so that there's nothing they can do if the flight that is the last one is already overbooked when they say the flight is over booked they mean that even the waiter who do you call them the air hostesses they're going to be squeezed they may share some of the seeds with other people it's full it's overbooked that maybe they don't even tell us that they are sitting at the back standing maybe they don't tell us so me and brother wilson we said ah brother what do we do uh we're going to your house or my house so that we sleep there together tomorrow wake up early in the morning oh we are just chatting about it then we are sitting down and we are talking and we are talking about god and we start to talk about god and something happened that we started to talk about when brother brandon's flight was stopped remember and then the prophet's flight was stopped and uh you know he came out and then the lord did his work how many remembers the story you know the story so and then we started talking about that and we started talking and we were lost in the discussion one discussion led to the other to the other to the other but talking about god and what he has done for us as young men so about maybe 10 minutes before the flight could go you know you're supposed to go in there 15 minutes if i'm not wrong before they close the gate your luggage if you are checking them in they should have long been in right the next thing we are sitting like they're talking putting our feet there on the balcony chatting and chatting we see a lady coming to us running an air hostess type of a reception lady said where are those people to join us there where are those people to join us back i need two two people two ah what is this ladies thing i thought it's overbooked you know we didn't have time to think yeah we just grabbed little suitcases and ran to her and then she just showed us to the gate we ran through we didn't we just went inside the airplane 10 minutes later the aircraft left when we were already in the airplane we still could not believe what happened [Music] so why am i telling you this testimony i'm telling you this testimony because when you create an atmosphere when you talk about god the bible says he come closer he come closer to you so so when you bring him closer he come when you go one step towards him he come two steps towards you that's what he does you know the song that he if you take a step towards him he'll take two towards you ah it says and before you know you'll be running around with a heart full of happiness you know that one so that's what happens so why are the thoughts louder than your voice in heaven because when you talk when you are talking about something it has started somewhere in your thought ah you know they say someone that says faith is uh what does it say uh faith is works expressed who can who is the message what's the same one works is faith expressed but it reminded me of that but what i want to tell you is that a words words are thoughts expressed your ways are the thoughts expressed in other words before god could say let there be he thought and remember god's thoughts are real god's thoughts are not like my thoughts and your thoughts god's thoughts is eternal when he thinks that thought is like real it's more tangible than this thing is alive his thought that is why when he he thought about you and then you became a reality he thought about you and when he spoke you you became into existence that's why god's thoughts are so powerful but you are the bride isn't it you are part of him you are you are taken from his right so if you are part of him that means your thoughts a what they're powerful a believer of the word of god a daughter and a son of god a bride of god stores are powerful so which means that we we me and you must be very careful remember the prophet in the bible who was angry he got so angry the prophet until he called the best the best to kill the children because the weight of god inside a human being is so powerful it's so real it can cause great harm it can cause it can cause life that's why i'm saying to you why are our thoughts so loud in heaven not our ways our voice why because a thought is something that is so powerful a thought creates an atmosphere a thought even before you can say it before it can be expressed by means of a voice or a word it is create an atmosphere let me show you and you know you can just sit down by yourself and think and start to create an atmosphere just through your heart through the force and the thinking of your heart you can sit alone and become miserable and of course an atmosphere of misery that's how powerful a thought is you see now because i can't see there if you don't mind i'm going to read here because i i i i i will request the technicians next time that we must use the big big one no pleasure brothers no pressure we cannot have listen to the prophet we cannot have a healing service here until people get in the spirit of the healing service what is the healing what is the spirit of the healing service people go to a rugby game people go to a cricket game or a soccer game or whatever game you have to get in the spirit of that game otherwise it is not going to take place when you come to church for the service get in the spirit of the service otherwise how is the savings going to take place how is the service going to take place between you and god it must get in the spirit it must get in the atmosphere i took my car for the service today the moment it gets there they prep it to get it ready for service they take the book they check everything they check the things that need to be fixed and they prepare report and they service the car you come to the service me and you come here we spend time money everything that we think is important and then we don't want to get in the spirit of the healing service how is the healing going to take place excuse me now he says the prophet we cannot have a feeling of the holy schools until people get in that kind of an in a atmosphere we have to if we want the holy spirit we have to if we want to be refreshed if we want to be refilled if we want someone to get healed let's get in the spirit of what we want and the people was in the atmosphere in that day to bring a judgment upon the earth the people who never wanted to listen to god and they are in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and all kinds of and all these kinds of things like that and the glory of god is being preached and demonstrated and the power of the holy ghost setting forth an example of the resurrection of jesus christ coming that's coming to take the church into glory just as certain as i am standing here that's right and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it walking away from it because they are in the spirit of the last day so which at the atmosphere that me and you create is not for those ones the ones that me and you must strive for or surrender for that's the one that is going to take us home are we together i like that part that i've highlighted in black day that we cannot have a healing service here in sakayana tabernacle think about uh you don't have a problem okay you've got no problem you're just praising the lord you're enjoying life but you're not in the atmosphere do you think people with you in service will get healed do you think your neighbor your brother will receive their need if you are an obstacle of creating an atmosphere that means individually and collectively we have to create an atmosphere when we come here we must shut everything aside our thoughts our problems our excitement what made me happy today okay our thoughts we know that the scripture of jeremiah 29 now the great god who makes the heavens and the earth was talking to the israel the children of israel and they were in babylon in captivity just like you and me are here in this little prison but the rules and the laws and the circumstances of the prison don't control us why because we create an atmosphere in prison remember paul and salas they were in prison remember how many remember that the bible says they were bound yeah you know not bound with a little rope here and then tie you there no no no no no they bound them with stocks you know stocks is those little wood that they put on your feet and they bind you also on your hands in prison maybe three walls around with high top security the king's brigade guarding them and they still tie them like that why is the devil doing that because the devil wants to create an atmosphere for them to know that they are conquered he wants to show them psychologically psychologically thought psychologically it goes with the thinking the mind he wants to create and when you know when they took nelson mandela and them to prison when you go to south africa you must take a moment and go there i'll take you there if i go with you you go to that prison called robin island it's an island 12 kilometers from the city and you find that okay i mean you can put these people here in an island they will never run away so just build proper houses no no it's a prison they build prisons and walls and then they still put them in big steel frames individually because you must have the thinking and the mentality of being in prison but them they did only one mistake because they were fighting for political freedom paul and silas were like worse than that damn the bible says they started to sing the songs and hymns louder and louder they they realized that to fight an atmosphere of the enemy you must bring another atmosphere if you watch that movie called the ten commandments oh sorry judah ben aye you'll find another card called masala he's a shirt bad guy a roman guy obviously he's a roman because those guys they were he he said to the people that how do you fight an idea you fight it with another idea that's what he believed so i'm saying to you paul and salas realize that the atmosphere that the enemy is creating around them of defeat and being conquered can only be destroyed by creating another atmosphere and they knew that they they had been given the power to create that atmosphere so they started do you think when they started to sing they knew what the lord was going to do do you think they knew and then wait and they were encouraged that ah we know now let's see more than the prison no no they probably did not know but it is the atmosphere that they created that became so powerful that even the stocks that they were bound with even the prison walls they had to obey to that atmosphere and that atmosphere tonight it is within you it is within you say it is within me who was who was preaching and said we must stand up the other day was it the pastor who was it oprah yes i like that my brother i like it because we have to be active in the service of the lord let's create an atmosphere that will give us deliverance when we are in church let's be so uh so zealous let's be so zealous so encouraged because here we have come for life and death and you know that you have been given life already paul and salas knew that they are sons of god man that's one thing that was very clear one thing that the devil must know is that you are the son of god that must be very clear that's our point of departure that's where we move from devil is it you yes all right let's start now wherever you want to start i ben bailey i'm a son of god okay he says yes say good now let's start what do you have today what do you have david don't ask don't allow him to ask you like that you ask him like what do you have when things go like this annoys you let's start very clear i'm a son of god is that very clear to you devil it is written i'm a son of god is it clear yes he says oh good now bring it on bring it because i've got an atmosphere to overpower that don't be scared of the day don't be scared of a challenge i know it's easier said than done that's the one that's why the lord chose the foolishness of preaching to encourage you i don't i never understand why it says the foolishness of preaching i need to be educated on that but the lord chose preaching to do what to bring the word of life to the people today if i stand on the street and preach people will say please where does he come from huh oh no he comes from this side apart he lives somewhere here this guy so is he okay just by standing and preaching when i try to create that atmosphere they are bringing a counter one so we must never be scared or intimidated by the enemy jeremiah he wrote to the children of god god spoke to him and he said for i know the thoughts that i think towards you said the lord thought of peace and not of evil that's how much god thinks about you those were the children of israel and you are spiritual israel today you are spiritual israel you have been crafted you have been brought in and they were put to suffer so that me and you can come in and be the bride it's you you must believe it brother and sister you must believe that it is you and believe it for real that you are the bride of god and he chose you don't allow the atmosphere that says with my weaknesses with this with whatever no no it's not about what you have done it's not about what you may do in the future you are a son and a daughter of god and you have to believe that to believe in something it means to do it i don't know how i can express it to believe it amen when i believe i've got a family i don't i don't have to doubt that my wife loves me my children and i've got this and that no no i have those things they are mine god gave them to me i don't doubt if someone comes and say oh man your wife does not really no no no no who can remove me from there i know they are mine brain challenge is yes but i know my wife my children my family they are mine but you can bring challenges it's okay but they are mine are we together so that you need to always have a clear demarcation of point of departure with the devil hallelujah he says to them then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will here can unto you i will hear you audibly and clear when you do what when you call upon the name of the lord when you pray and you shall seek me the lord is not mincing his weight not it's not saying you may seek me or you will or you you are encouraged to seek me no you shall if you read the legal books and the law and the jurisdiction documents they use that word shall because what what do you call it in english how many t-shirts are here he said what do you call it huh i can't hear you it's a will it's a will yeah you know will it gives you it gives you like a room you you will you will do it you may choose not to do it you will there's a will yes where there's a will that's the way i agree but when they say thou shall they are not asking you they are not giving you an option thou shalt love the lord your god with all your heart that's your commandment thou shalt love your enemy and give him food thou shall not take thy brother's wife those are commandments they're very clear they are not saying you will not you know we say to your children you will not yes they understand that i will not but sometimes i will and then you will hit me and all that is because it's my is based on my i will if i want to i will do it i will but if you say charles it's a strong weight they lose they use it in the legal juggle now i wanted to read for you about the thoughts that god has towards you and i wanted to tell you that you are spiritual israel and god thought about you and he is confirming to you that he says he he got he knows those thoughts about you now the question is do you know the thoughts that you think about god yourself tonight huh do i know the thoughts that i think about god constantly daily every minute do i know the thoughts that i'm thinking about my brother or my sister what thoughts do i think about my brother or my sister what are those thoughts because god says him he knows the thoughts that he thinks towards me it's beautiful to be thought by god he said to moses hey i have now remembered my promise my thoughts about my children they're in egypt i have now remembered what i say it's like god can forget no no god likes to express his thoughts and you are god's thought now i'm asking you a question what are your thoughts you about god right now as we speak if you can just pause and just jump into your active memory or active thought process what are your thoughts about god okay now the prophet taught us that we are amateur gods an amateur god a little creator you are but have you ever seen somebody who don't understand who they are or what they have you feel pity for them man you feel pity you don't know what to do for them oh my brother thank you so much god bless you see that brother loves me so much thanks for considering me don't have to look the bag is for me the big screen thank you brothers there god bless god bless your thoughts about me now and we ought to get ourselves in that kind of an atmosphere the prophet says create each each one of you is a creator but brothers and sisters let's wait here do you know what is a creator a creator the closest human being can get or the devil he can get is he calls it invention not the closest not even closest the best he can try he calls it innovation innovation he just means that he found something that he didn't know before but he has always been there somewhere because the bible says there's nothing new on the face of this earth that's what the bible says so but god is way billions and billions of light years above that he's a creator him he thinks and a thought comes to exist you see this here can you see this in front of me he created a [Laughter] you see and the bible says everything under the sun under the water in the atmosphere everywhere he created them out of his thought out of his weight he created that now what strikes me the most i pray it strikes you he says and you do you know that do you know that you are a creator i'm not trying to to bully you i'm just trying to show you and help you to realize that you are a creator no they say we shouldn't say this t too hard brother ben once i must say once a creator creator is that right now i like it to be wrapped in creator they say creator is god now you are that creator you sitting here in 113 george street stokes valley right now you are a creator of what of atmospheres now your your you're on a journey as you're on a journey you're creating you you either create a good atmosphere or a bad one but because you are a son and a daughter of god you are almost careful and cautious to make sure that the atmosphere you create is the one that your father is the one that can heal someone is the one that someone can say i want to come visit you brother john because they felt an atmosphere with you they felt healing they come and talk to you they are happy why what they call happiness in the world is not happiness a true joy of a daughter and the son of god you know when i listen to sister megan testimony i felt happiness i even stopped what i was doing and i pray i say lord what is going on with this system god bless you and each one of you is a creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again is a but that's a powerful statement we can just dwell on that statement how can i be a creator lord you have to believe that you are creator you are not boasting you are not making it up you must believe that god has taken you a humble person a person who may be already written off that you are a creator because you create atmospheres atmospheres that are so powerful that the the the binding of the devil when you think that he caught you they fall just because of the atmosphere that you create create an atmosphere for your problem don't allow it create an admin don't focus on the problem the issue is to focus on the wrong thing no no focus on the creation of the atmosphere it's even more powerful when we get together the devil knows that oh they've come now when they come to church to sing i've got a problem with these people i've got a problem because when they come to fellowship they do it for real they do it from their hearts and they you know there's one thing that the devil will never defeat is the reality of what you do genuinely because he's trying to fight it but he finds that he's just solid rock [Music] and it's so simple faith and surrender of creator of creating the atmosphere and he gets so frustrated he just go out and call more demons and he find that the lord when he went there brought more angels because the bible says he raised up a standard when the enemy goes to bring more demons he raised a bay that is why you are where you are today you are where you are you are not worth of no no you are better off you are where you are today because god wrote the standard don't look at what you have not done look at what god has done already for you that's what me and you must look at not all what i'm failing to do no no what god has already done that's what we need to look at little creators sometimes when i'm at home and and the wife is all the people is in out and out just going all the time i go in and wife standing in there whipping her eyes crying and she said bill the children has not even eaten who knows the story the prophet is trying to talk about creating the atmosphere now there's a problem with the downside of a believer stored because this person is a believer he's the son and a daughter of god the devil also knows it huh so he comes to test you with his thoughts now if you allow him because you're a son and daughter of god there's a downside there's a problem with the thoughts that you can allow simply because you are the son of god you may find that some people can say things they don't happen you say things you think things they happen be careful what you think what you say what you what what the process the thoughts that goes through you because god said i have the thought of peace for you what thoughts am i thinking if i think negative thoughts if i think ungodly thoughts if i allow them it's all right the thoughts can come because uh they agreed god and satan that the best place to go and fight this battle must be through the thought process ah why because a thought is so powerful even you the prophet taught you and me that our thoughts as we sit here they speak louder in heaven why our thoughts not our voice when i'm shouting so high a thought is so powerful it creates an atmosphere so now and oh by the way i can see that and it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of god among the people it is the atmosphere who can tell me anything that you can think of that exists here on earth that could have not been influenced by an atmosphere anything and think about the best things what you call the best you know elon musk for him to be where he is today he got inspired right and there was an atmosphere that made him to think and to to do the things that he has done anyone there must be an atmosphere for something to come to existence right you know that even an egg the prophet taught us that you can take it and put it under a puppy a little pity puppy like what's the puppy sister jenny huh the small one you're one yeah it's not rupen oh there's another one also more fluffier if you take an egg a fertilized egg of a chicken and i put it under looping and you bind lupine warm put a little blanket on the lupine just you don't move lupine give everything there after 21 days that egg will hatch why because there is an atmosphere that suits that egg to hedge are we together so so an atmosphere is something that is so powerful but you see an atmosphere goes an atmosphere it does not just a calm there's a thought that came for an atmosphere to exist there is a fertilization there is an egg that is there right because god is god his atmosphere brings things to existence my thoughts and your thoughts brings things that yeah i can see any person can strive so hard that is why wealthy people when they want to do something they know that they must create an atmosphere they go to the stadium even the witches they get in their spirit first they know it that an atmosphere is so power you have to make someone to believe something before you can bring it to pass otherwise it's going to be hopeless right let's let's move on so we need to be and and and here the prophet says and when people get to a place they are reasoning and wandering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and don't know where they stand they do stand half of them not even scripturally thought how can we expect the atmosphere to be right that's not much talking to us but it is talking to us eh let's move on to the next one you you go around where there's arguments you get into the type of an atmosphere yes an argument also i thought i said to you think about anything you drive you must get in the atmosphere of driving otherwise you can't drive how can you drive if the church is something in the church someone who is disobedient very ugly acting in the church causing troubles you will never be able to have a revival as long as that that kind of an atmosphere is around what's the problem we have to be very careful as believers because one person you know aiken do you know a man called akem the whole family even a little baby they had to be banned because the father made a mistake he created a stealing atmosphere painted around the family and they had to die no you don't want your brother and your sister to suffer because you don't strive or pray for the right atmosphere in your heart in your mind in church we don't want that i i'm trying not to means my ways on that one because this is about people's lives we are a fellowship together we have to pray that lord not for me but for my brother for my sister for my brother my sister lord help me to be faithful help me to create the right mental thought process in my mind help me to be prayerful and be expect underexpectation when i go to church because that will paint on your children that will paint on your brother and sister a brother will get healed a brother will get delivered because you create an atmosphere amen and the opposite is unfortunately the truth you see let's talk about the the brothers from emails the brothers two emails you know they were walking on a journey to emmaus now they were working hopeless defeated but they were talking about him you know the scripture i can't read it for the sake of time you know either and they were walking and they were walking and then as they were walking they were still on the outer court i like what the pastor said on sunday man it excites me they were on the outer court they were more on the outer court on the flesh yeah we have we thought that amen that man really i really really believe that he's gonna save israel and i loved him so much i miss him they were on the flesh they were on the outer court then he came closer to them can i tell you he didn't come closer he brought them in the inner court then they thought he came closer the bible says of course i'm not interpreting the bible wrong hopefully i believe he brought them closer into the better medium called the middle one he start to talk to them ah the bible says decided to talk to them and they discuss with them and he tells them about the scriptures and about moses and the prophets he says all you fools here somewhere did you sit here are you full slow to her slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken he's bringing them in a different atmosphere he's bringing them in the inner court in the inner court where they can start to say oh oh this is the spirit of the lord you know they can start to feel better but they're not there yet they are not there but their hearts are just burning what who is he where does he come from how did he know these scriptures is lopez talking to him i mean to who's the other brother lopez and who and his friend i'll be troll pass brother you'll be his friend you want to be troopers okay clopaz and his friend they were talking talking and talking and he come close because they were on the flesh he come closer then this their heart starts to burn their heart starts to have a burden yeah but he's fight men both of them they're not talking they're listening but both of them their hearts were starting to have their bedding and the bar until the bible says did not our husband later on when they were in the inner in the holy of holies they asked that question because when they were moving and walking when he talked to them and talked to them they now swim there in the inner court in the middle court they assume that they are there when he saw that they are ready now they are about to pass he make receive his passing he makes as if he's not coming in because they were already burning they said no man where are you going to sleep come in with us you see come in with us let's eat and then we'll go you see they think they're bringing him but he was it was him bringing them in the holy of holies then he come in the holy off and then they sit on the table and they start to eat wake up when they are there starting to eat the bible says their eyes were what inside the holy of holies and the bible says their eyes were open now they said ah lord is you amen and he said to them peace be unto you amen when you are there when you are in the holy of holies peace of god covers you because those are his thoughts those are his when you walk with him to my ears huh you walk there come a point where he makes as if he's passing and he he comes in with you in the holy of holies when you start to see ah it's you lord then you are in you know that is him and you know that you are in this is him still talking to them at the end he just said to them peace be with you guys bye-bye and he was gone because now they are in he does not have to tell them about the scriptures anymore he doesn't have to work with them the journey has come to an end you are silt now amen you know when you steal something have you ever bought a tin of condensed or a thinner it's sealed i don't know how they do that but both sides and but you have to take a tin or penne to open it it's sealed sometimes i even used to open it at the bottom because i don't know the top and bottom which way because it's sealed that's you you are filled until the day of your life hallelujah those brothers okay i've already told you this right jesus joined them they were on flesh level talking and all that then he talked with them spirit level he moves in with them inside then when they were in there then their eyes started to open because when you are in there even your manner does not get rotten it stays fresh when you are in there you know that hey devil i am a wife of god what are you talking about nobody tells you you are in right now i want to talk about the aspect of spending time creating this atmosphere what you spend your time on on this journey we agreed that we are working what do you spend your time on i wish i thought and brought it with me was in the christian businessman the prophet is telling them about the story here and he said what is it it's atmosphere men and women should live under that atmosphere don't get out from under some normal well-existing influence but stay under the atmosphere of their lord jesus every time that is why when i started i ask you oh i forgot to ask you i wanted to ask you out of one from one to ten how much time do you spend thinking about god a day that's a hard question eh it's an unfair question but it's actually fair i know we are busy let's put our work aside okay let's allocate our work three or four or are we allocating our week nine how much time do you and me me spend time just meditating about god the pastor taught us that hey praying is not just only when you go and kneel down and you prepare yourself no no you can pray as you're talking as you're standing there as you're working as you're going to work as you are busy working you are busy working brother ben and you hate yourself on the finger the first thing that comes to your mind is oh lord jesus help me because your atmosphere that is around you you are thinking everything mind whatever you see when you want to sin you just think about him when you want to think you think about him when you're hurt when you're angry when you're happy him huh one day we almost sang with my uncle in a little beauty parky and it was heavy raining we had to cross a big river we were he said we had to pass and that little buggy that we were driving in you know we were getting wet inside the bike up to here but he's going i just hit him what the car was going like this i just heard him say oh lord jesus save us amen who do you want to call in times like that what atmosphere do you want to create there's no time to go by a four by four that time you are in a little car you're in the middle of the river you're wait until here and you are dying it can roll anytime who are you going to call who is that closest on your tongue but now that must not only happen when we are in prison like pollen salads the bible says when we are happy when we are sad when we are everything he must be on the tips of our time right help us my father my god spending time within that atmosphere enoch you know about enoch the bible says he spent so much time with the lord until god just took it to him home he walked with god until god just raptured him he says here you know who claimed that he worked with god for 500 years and had a testimony he pleased god he had faith faith that he would see he would not see death how could god do it there wasn't even a jet plane in those days to get into off his feet but god provided a way when you think and walk with god god makes a way where they see meth not to be away he makes a way enoch abraham say abraham until god said hey let's go for a walk and he took him for a walk and he said what can i hide from him because they were in fellowship they were working together every day why didn't god say okay call saturday please angelus you can go to sodom i'll find you go do the work and come back sarah come bring her family why didn't he say bring bring bring bring sarah let's talk i wanna i cannot hide anything no this is an individual affair god called abraham as they were working and he told him what he's going to do what was the purpose for god to do that what wha why did god because god could have just went and banned sodom and gomorrah but he said himself god this man worked with me so much what can i hide from him so brother and sister there's nothing that god can hide from you he reveals everything you have every thing do you believe it let's finish off great jehovah now this is brother branham praying he says he said i was one of those who made wins to cease no no sorry this now uh i've now jumped to this to the point where the prophet now when he was at the mountain you know the story when he was at the mountain and there was a storm and there was pronouncement of the weather the weatherman has said that there's going to be a terrible weather the brothers were hunting up there remember the story and then all of a sudden as he was working himself down and the snow was falling so heavily then he just heard his voice he just had a voice saying go back through that storm you see because god wanted to walk with him this thing called work is very important brother and sister this thing called working with the lord is so important that we cannot afford not to work with him daily and working with him it means thinking about him it means praying it means reading the word it means spending time to nourish your relationship with god how else is it going to happen how else if you don't send your wife a message during the day out of the blue and the emoji of love she's just gonna say in the evening okay i love you create an atmosphere brother and sister and you aren't married when you get married create it in the meantime send the lord and emoji of love every morning send the lord a smile every morning and say lord thank you i'm awake i want to tell you something my father my god my husband i still love you thank you for waking me up because why sleeping is a natural process but waking up is grace are we together waking up is grace sleeping you can just lay your head on the pillow you're tired naturally you go to sleep too how can you say waking up is a natural process it's grace because many did not wake up many did not wake up but they slept so is grace tell him instead of sending instead of running to facebook testing when you wake up first thing you think of the word facebook why first thing when you wake up is that you are jesus testing when you wake up say my father are you there send him an emoji knee down tell him how much you love him how much you appreciate him i love so much that dream that sister naomi spoke about when she was telling me an ending was it me and you brother that you know she wanted god to show her something spending time just thinking about the technology and the things of heaven how is it going to be i wonder if there's going to be lines on lanes on that road of gold i wonder what color is going to be because you like to think about technology and the things of the world convert it to the heavenly one me when i grow up i believe that when you get to heaven the first time we're going to have coffee i believe that because my mother she says no i dreamed but i remember her telling me when i was small that we're going to have a coffee and tea with milk you know so i grew up as a small little guy knowing that when we get to heaven i'm sure the saucers are going to be you know a tea with a salsa you know in the english way with milk it's got a certain smell so when i was a little boy i had that in my image imagination about heaven so my mother was trying if she told me i don't think she told me i think i just imagined so let's create an atmosphere spend time with him i know you know this but i'm just reiterating the holy spirit is just sitting on this point because it keeps on happening and happening and he sees you and he knows that you heard the step the preaching that when you wake up don't run to your phone there's actually a study that has proven that you become so ineffective if the last thing that you see when before you sleep is your phone and you are reading on it and you god spend time snooze into your sleeping put it there on flight mode yeah because if you're in flat mode the alarm will still come yes kalam will come but put it on flight and then you wake up when you wake up you don't look oh no no how can this be your god satan's invention not even creation he invented this he was trying to copy the things that happens in our dimension because in his dimension he can only think of youtube the devil we don't deal with youtube we deal with things of seventh dimension we go through the world we create an atmosphere of loving the unlovable that's us we fight hardness and anger with love and care how can you ever see such a technology it's not a technology is actually to to understate it it's not technology it's life he's trying to make life with the technology but we are way above that sister jenny isn't it remember when i call your name i don't mean you do that please it's because i love you i just happen to to see you and call you right okay mo technology of the devil is to undermine your god-given atmosphere is to bring it down right so let's not let's put it in his place and start to think of our own technology our own creation our own create a right atmosphere you know when you take a journey you prepare how can you wake up every morning and not prepare for the road for the journey of the day set up everything ready for the day this is god telling brother branham and then he tells him he tells him he tells him he said speak to those winds and the storm it will go away as they are busy working he actually told him don't you want to stroll with me somewhere here sorry i'm just trying to finish up but he told him did you see it the previous one thank you for the quick eyes or this one no that's fine but this presentation is available because i've gone over an hour now he said don't you want to stroll with me imagine god telling you remember brother brandon in closing is is a wave shift it's a sample it's an example of how you and me are going to come up you know when you bake cakes in that oven and you bring the first pen and you say all of them i want them to come like this golden brown sugar salt everything perfect and you take them out that's the wave sheath every one of them is going to come through them because they go through the same fire the same heat the same pen the same tray everything so we have to go through what the prophet went through and now we go through it with happiness it's coming now brother and sister i want to leave it here i think from here i'm just talking about the prophet when he was uh saying the very god of creation uh in all his hands he what he's telling me and he picked me and then i picked up my gun i walked off my scope started to walk back up backward up in the mountain where the snow and heavy snow god was working with you when god works works with you don't worry just give me five more minutes please and then uh i go down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness walk with me with a question mark god was asking amen don't you want to walk with me the same way he did with enoch they were walking every day they were walking with dave david until david says you know when i walk even if i can walk through the valley of shadow and death huh he's with me he even keep my foot when in the presence of my enemies because he walks with you i am the sheep he i don't come after him i mean i don't come before him you know their brother ed at home when we take goals and sheep we follow them that's the wrong way of being a shepherd a shepherd walks in the front and they follow that's the real history of shepherd the lord is my shepherd he called his stuff and he walked and he she follows him because he must see where's the greener pastures and i'm going there then they follow he's not saying hey come on he's just going there they follow him but our ones because they are laudician goats and cows they run there and we used to make what you call nope killis what is a nob kiri armand a stock with that with that with that we didn't make a nice stuff to bring them nice no and not kill so that when you hit it on the horn it must the account must do this and know that my shepherd says i must not go there because it's a audition kettle cow it just become wild but if it was a real shepherd of the seventh damage i mean a real animal sheep it will follow the shepherd see so that's what god was doing with the prophet telling him to create an atmosphere to tell the storm and he did for four days the weather changed even the garage man the person at the garage the philly station was telling him when he went there and that's in another spokane right now he says i went there to the feeding station enter the the petrol attendant was asking was telling me hey something strange very very strange happen he says what he says the weather they predicted bad weather and everything suddenly changed and the brother never told him that no no it was me and god he didn't tell him he just said yeah that's very strange that was that's wonderful isn't it a beautiful day isn't it he said he didn't tell him because how do you think that man will believe it i mean how do you think it will do to that man you'll explode him that please man say where do you come from you see for that man to know that we need to be an atmosphere that will make that man to understand that oh he's the prophet of god who did this when he was with god in the wilderness a few hours ago it does not make sense in the carnal sense of the way it doesn't there brother ben he's doing this oh this brother was with was with talking to god just outside here they were discussing things just before he comes in here and he stand here and tell us i was just talking to the lord wait for weight responding and you will say brother are you all right we won't believe you because we underestimate ourselves yes it shall come to pass that those things will happen that said the lord it shall come to pass because he says greater things and all the other believers paul silas peter and all you know i know i heard of the man called um the man who translated the bible into english tindale ahead of such men i feel moved because those people were our example they knew who they were by the revelation of the word of god until that the command of the king of england was not a problem he had to move to germany to go and translate the bible because he had the revelation he knew i am given an opportunity to give access
