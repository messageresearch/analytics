TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] so I started to care about maybe 15 leaves that we hopped in it was like hmm 25 20 reason me and um you know we complaining about how cold it is but Shannon said you know there was a time when people would have to go on a horse and buggy to church and this sort of temperature and no air conditioning no real insulation and I guess their clothes weren't the greatest but they weren't anyway so overall as a as a people we have it we have life reasonably easy and and you know it's always good to keep that in perspective so that our attitudes that become soft you know and we complain about having to graft but alien and the cold and go to church or anything like that you know it's good - it's good to keep them perspective can you hear me am I going okay that's good but you know

let's go to the scripture shall we let's go to first Kings and chapter 21 we're just going to read from here again from first one day unto verse 14 thank you brother could be appreciate it now if it should be in the queue there Amen source is here and it came to pass after these things I just see if I can drive this okay good and it came to pass after these things that neighbor the jezreelite head of vineyard which was in Jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria and I have spoken to neighbor saying give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and I'll give thee for it a bit of vineyard in it or if it seem good to thee I'll give thee the worth of it and money and they both said to Ahab the Lord forbid it means that I should give the inheritance of my father's unto thee and they have came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which they both the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I'll not give me the inheritance of my father's and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread no as we said last week he had an adult tantrum and but geez Abell his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her because I spake unto name off the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please the I will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my vineyard and G's Abell his wife see and have dust they'll not govern the Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread let thy heart be merry I will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite for she wrote letters and Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in the her city dwelling with Naboth and she wrote and the letters saying proclaimer fast and set now both on high among the people and set to men sons of Belial before him to be a witness against them saying thou does blaspheme God and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of his City when the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants of a city that as Jezebel had said unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed her fast and said neighbor thought high among the people and they came into men children of Belial and set before him and amenable are witnessed against him even against nay both and the presence of the people saying nay both did blaspheme God and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died then he sent that then they sent rather to Jesus about saying nay both the stoned and is dead and it came to pass when Jesus name both was stoned and was dead that G's Abell said to Ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for neighbor tha's not alive but did and it came to pass when Ahab heard that they both was dead that they have rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take position of it amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to continue on from what I was speaking last Sunday about the effects of attention and going beyond going beyond a crush to real love but I want to take the other part of this about the effects of having a human or your adult tantrum and so we see here a hat because he would didn't have a good character he was you know he was kind of wishy-washy didn't didn't really you know there's times he repented but he didn't fully give his life to the Lord and he would you know he would be governed by govern basically but is about because we understand bit there's something if there's a void in someone's life something's going to fill it brother Brahim says we are full of something you can be full of nonsense you can be full of of gossip it can be full of malice you can be full of strife or you can be full of the Holy Ghost so so we're all full of something I mean even even just even if someone's just a bunch of nothing well they fall or nothing you know so so I have because he he didn't possess kingship properly he let other things kind of push him around but I want to show you now the effect of him having this tantrum now he desired his emotions led him the Word of God did not lead him so he saw the vineyard he says I want it so so so stir so his emotions as his desire was I want this vineyard he had bitter ones remember he said to neighbor I'll give you a better weather than this one so it wasn't the fact that that he didn't have better vineyards he just wanted that one but there's something when someone you know they they they want something but they can't get it and and is and these two options will happen one they will actually say okay fair enough or two they will just laughs after the thing and if they can get it they will get it and so I had because here's the King you know instead of accepting the fact that that that the the response that neighbor gave him was based on the word remember was wrong to to sell inherited and inheritance to to some other family had to stay within the family sown a boss was response was based on the Word of God and so if a ham was actually you know if he actually really accepted it he wouldn't have thrown a tantrum and go laid on the bed and cried to himself saying poor me why was me but because his emotions were leading him his emotions took control and because he threw that tantrum they both ended up dying right they both got killed but it also brought judgment upon his own self and not only himself but his entire family so we're going to be very careful how we react to things right it'll either it will either bring judgment or I'm gonna take the flip side of it as it will bring mercy to us it's our attitude towards every situation is very important so you know so what I want to take this morning is the effects of a tantrum and the effects of being a prisoner of the of the Lord Jesus Christ to a very two opposite things I mean so so one here one a head here was a prisoner to his emotions and basically it's unconverted nature and the other was not and the other that we'll go into or I'll just bring some examples they're not there on the other lords so their heart is governed fully by the Holy Ghost in my neighbor I mean I mean I had there are times he repented he actually sought the Lord's favor but was just basically just to get out of trouble you know many people repent because they get caught as opposed to God dealing with them true repentance is not because you get caught it's because actually God deals with you I mean so you know we don't want to just be oh you got busted so I'm sorry got your deal on our hearts Amen so so he got so now I just want you to we're just going to keep reading about me and technology aren't friends here we are where are we no we were backwards please hold okay here we are now they have had no idea that the effects of his tension would cause him to die in battle and dogs would look as blood and many times when we react to things we never think of the consequences it's always the here and the now and this is how I'm gonna be and this is what's going on in who cares and did it I'm gonna give my five cents I'm going to tell them give them a piece of my mind well really we should hold on to our mind because we'll lose our mind if we keep giving it away right so but you see he never he'd never fathomed in his mind that his reaction to nabe off would actually be he's gonna die in battle and the dogs are gonna lick his blood and The Jezabels gonna get eaten and his sons are gonna die and you know and because we never really look into maybe the effects of our response to things remember this life this society we live on is supercharged by emotion supercharged by the spirit live in the moment heaven and now you know why wait you don't need to wait heaven right now you know everything it though you don't need to say for money just you just use credit and you know I can I can have it right now I don't need to work for it I can just you know it's all instant it so it's all supercharged by emotion and but so and and the problem with that is that there's no stability in the world anymore talk about human character everything's either pulled by what this thing or this thing and pick a side make your decision you for us or against us or there's no middle ground anymore you even see what's going on in America at the moment you know that it's falling apart and we know it has to fall apart because the prophecy that's going to be smoke bombs and crowd so we can't stop it but it ones it's also polarized and that's the problem worth worth worth social media and you know what I would say to you through this could be very different to how I'd say to it to your face you know you know but this thing gives people a boldness you know you know even even now with with with young people even my generation you know you know you're sexting and so on your people unconverted people sending nude pics and different things and how they flirt online is very different to how that actually interact with people face to face why because there's this thing that they think it kind of makes them a bit more invincible or something and things that you would say to people online you wouldn't actually say it to their face but that's because that's the platform of communication has actually made the world more polarized there's no middle ground as meant to be an exchange of ideas Beck's actually just to grandstand shouting at each other instead of finding a middle ground amen and so we're going to be very careful that we could just keep walking with the word in an unstable age I mean there will be one people that will be stable and those who are surrendered to the Word of God though that know that God will stay stable amen you look at all the strife going on and Noah's day he just kept going on through didn't matter what was going on around him amen amen so I doubt very much that a habitat ever crossed his mind he had his dogs would be licking his blood because of what he did now now when I'm talking about this I'm not talking about like you know it's very different to have a tantrum and actually go and resolve a like the scripture says if there's an issue member we should we should deal with issues you know I think that's the problem with especially the Western world everything's fine on the outside but on the inside there's daggers and there's guns and there's plans and you know you know what I mean but you know we need to talk about things if they need to be addressed they need to be addressed and then hey if it tears the hide off my back good let's just get it done like it sees in the scripture here it says but I saying to you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment but whosoever shall say to his Muraki shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift if thou bring thy gift of the altar and there rememberest it that that thy brother has Auto against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way be beat first be reconciled to thy brother then come and offer thy gift see here we come praise the Lord hallelujah glory or hold on I'm gonna lay my gift here I'm gonna go deal with this and then I'll come back so I'm not talking about when it comes to resolving issues you know there's a big difference between a tantrum and dealing with it right Amen now it's amazing and now this is this is maybe I'm just going to go kind of slowly through this button to me the children of Israel in the wilderness now this meant no this is just my kind of phraseology they had like a slow burning tantrum so then just erupted like this or slowly there was murmuring slowly us complaining maybe it started with one disgruntled here and one disgruntled here and they begin to talk and then finally the atmosphere and the camp began to change because you know it was sandy and it was hot and we're thirsty and you know so slowly it was so to me it's like a slow burning tantrum it's not a quick explosion but it was just like a slow kind of grumbling and so here they are it's amazing you know if you just read just just let's just break the scripture down here because this is where not long before this they cross the Red Sea they were dancing because their enemies were did Amen when it was like two million people had crossed the Red Sea and Miriam who's 80-odd years old took the tambourine and she laid all the sisters and worship and it would have been an incredible scene because their enemies were now dead and it's the same thing brother BAM says well when when we go through the blood of Jesus Christ we look back our enemies are dead amen our enemy of sinners dead and we have a jubilee hallelujah but then it wasn't long from that moment they were now in this condition now look and they journeyed and they took their journey from Elim and all the congregation of the children of Israel came into the wilderness of sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the 15th the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt they hadn't been gone very long and the children of Israel said unto them would to God would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we set by our fleshpots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger now they had forgotten that when they're in Egypt their babies were taken from them killed or just thrown to the crocodiles to be fed to the crocodiles they are beaten by taskmasters they were just like they were not even valued as people they were just a commodity a tool in Pharaoh's hand if he said kill them they died if they starve they starved if they were beaten they were beaten they weren't even bellied as humans but here they were they had forgotten where they came from and we must never forget where we came from that's the reason God allows us to remember where we came from is that we are still thankful hallelujah so there's that we should never forget where we came from efforts from the world praise the Lord I'm out of the world it was just from just sitting in a Pew not knowing God then I meet him praise the Lord I met him holier so we should never forget where God has brought us from but somehow they forgot where God had brought them from they were wanting to go back into that condition because their walk was becoming uncomfortable now here's just a picture I found you know this is what Moses was dealing with you know it wasn't hallelujah praise the Lord god bless you brother Moses how you doing today and hallelujah we're going to Canaan sphere land I'm so excited and remember that taskmaster guy he's dead hallelujah hallelujah saw him floating there he died you ain't got drowned and you know we're free and you know God's delivering us and he's leading us with a pillar of fire by night cloud by day hallelu you know we'll get a night light all the time we don't need to be scared of the dark you know you know they could rejoice and well they like the snow oh why did you lead us out here to die Moses I saw annoyed it's so sandy and it gets in my eyes and I'm sick of us angels food and I've sick of us you know I'm thirsty and I and remember that came out of Goshen it was a nice piece of real estate it was well watered you know it's nice by the sea or by the river and if I like so would have you you know everyone likes to have a view of the ocean yeah so so they had a nice place to live but it wasn't with God one of them teamed up but they forgot the afflictions they were under there now they're complaining and grumbling wake up no I'm sick of this and daughter you know just this begins to spread was a slow-burning tantrum now they had no idea that this attitude would cause them to wander for 40 years in the wilderness there were just a few days there's actually not far if you look on the map to go from Egypt to Israel you could walk there in a couple of days maybe or even at I don't know it's not far but because of their complaining their slow burning tantrum base would spend 40 years in the wilderness now I'm really gone on the negative boat I'm we're gonna swing to the other side eventually your buddies want you to think about this they did not they never fathomed that this attitude would cause them to die in the wilderness you see sometimes actually a lot of the time god our walk is through many different things it's not always on the hilltop it's not always glorious as we would appear as we would think glorious amen but it it takes he takes us through valleys he takes us through hard times but we must never become offended where God is leading us remember the first thing they got unhappy with as they cross the Red Sea they had a jubilee Pentecostal meeting brother Brown said but then they walked for three days without water they came to a water source and it was bitter so they came to a bitter experience in their walk and God led them there it wasn't them just saying I wish we go well and they'll say well we don't have mister gurus list why don't we go this way well this way no no God God ordained their steps even when they came up to the Red Sea it wasn't them just making a mad dash for it and I ended up there God told Moses walk here walk here you'll end up here it was actually their ambush was actually prearranged by preordained by gods that's the same thing you think Sonia heels no gods are seeing in ambush Amen to wipe out your enemy that you can look back and say God is my deliverer hallelujah but you know though getting all worried and stressed about it but you know God ordained them to walk that way and so we need to be I say lord help us I mean that we don't begin to be unhappy or even you know even offended where God will take us you know John the Baptist was a mighty was a mighty prophet Jesus would give him the greatest compliment saying there's none like him in the Old Testament amen nothing like him and then and then and and that's the Lord putting Moses there and Elijah and all the different great prophets in other John's better than these ones you know but but here he was he had fulfilled his mission on earth you know he pointed out the Lamb of God he blot you know you know he exposed the sin of all the religious systems he did exactly what else meant to do and so but then he ends up in prison and then brother Bram says his eagle eyes filmed over because where he ended up and so he said to two of his disciples go ask Jesus are you really how much it would look for another you know because maybe he didn't expect to end up in prison remember he didn't do anything that this please God he wasn't being punished you know he didn't put a foot wrong he was walking perfectly according to the word that was meant for him but he ended up in prison and so many times you know sometimes we think all things go bad because we've done wrong no not necessarily maybe sometimes things go wrong because we've done right right yeah it doesn't mean guys displeased with us I'm going through a hard time that doesn't mean guys displeased with you yeah but it's normally because you're the believer sincere wants to because we love him because he's he saved us he's washed us in his blood you know he's given us a ticket to heaven with that money or price you know because we love Him we don't want to hurt him so when something goes wrong we begin to think we're Lord have I displeased you in some way amen but that's not if something goes wrong it doesn't mean we've done wrong hallelujah member God's love is proven in his election that's how he's proven his love I mean it's not like lovers parental care love which which that kind of love is you want to protect your children from all harm wrap them up in cotton wool again and again and again like they're a big beach ball and everything's fine and you know wherever they go there's not God's love God's love is shown an election he called us before the foundation of the world and the evidence of that as you heard this message in a quickened change your life and you see their word ami manifested in your life hallelujah and that's God proving his love for you I mean some so we must never forget that but sometimes we think well things are going bad well obviously the law I've done something wrong and this no doubt maybe wasn't John's mind he was thinking you know he never I don't know if he ever imagined that this is where he would end up but God's ordained path was life was prison God's ordained path for his life was to be beheaded because a little girl danced before the king you know sometimes we don't realize but actually our lives the people's reaction to our lives rather bring mercy or judgment whether we like it or not and it's not our fault you know Jesus couldn't help how people responded to him here he was healed the sick raise the dead brought life he didn't heed it he couldn't help how the Pharisees responded to him you know he just he was just doing what he was called to do and sometimes we get to you know I hope this comes out the right way but you know we can't help our people respond it's the spirit within them that will respond to a certain way that doesn't mean we just walk on and who cares what people say or do we should be mindful of people you understand but you know you can't help if people hate you or love you or whatever you can't help it right so here's John he ends up in prison and then he says now he asked his disciples to go and then Jesus says this to them this is the report you're going to give he says Jesus answer verse four and said unto him go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me so so John is being told by the Lord you're blessed if you're not offended in me so do never we must never be offended where our walk will take us I mean because of member if we headed our own way nothing would go wrong we just plow through and we're just there the devil be mowed down in front of us never and will become a believer to be no trials or heartache or hardship or burden prayer or worry or shop none of that hey really really if you could really map out your life we'll just be oh boy hallelujah be like Rambo and nothing would go wrong and you at this theatres would you know but God hasn't made it that way because he wants to form character at us because that's the only thing we can take with us is our character you know there's a joke or something you know there was a man he um he he gave his whole life to business and and and what he ended up with was a few you know a pile of gold and he was actually for some reason allowed to take their gold with him up into glory and so he's there at the pearly gates and and st. Peter or whoever's there you know this is just it's just just a joke but you know you know the skies under this great wagga this gold so here I am I've arrived and st. Peter says John why are you bringing pavement into heaven you know men strives for pavement remember men the streets are lined with gold its pavement and but but people give their lives they they sacrifice their families they sacrifice so much just to earn pavement and remember in reality you can't take it with you anyway so you know we need a better perspective sometimes but you know this so but we should never be offended with a Lord takes us on our journey we just say Lord you've allowed this to happen remember Jesus said to Pilate the only reason you have power to help me crucified not because my father in Heaven's giving it to you don't think you've earned this sword don't think you've made this or achieve this no God allowed you to have this and it's the same thing all over the world people empower the reasons God allowed them to be in power that his word would be fulfilled I mean so we must never be offended when things go sideways or up or down or you're in zero gravity you don't know which ways up and things are going terrible don't be offended just keep walking through I mean but it all depends what your faith is upon if your faith is upon your emotions and how things appear to be going member thinks are as not as they appear write things out reality is not actually this this is passing away this is not even gonna be you know we're gonna remember being victorious and the devil being cast out and Paulo you know we're gonna remember the great victories you know but a lot of us is not even gonna be a memory you know so this the word is reality I mean the word is eternal I mean so let's not get caught up in things that come and go and trending not trending hashtags whatever you know it's gonna come it's gonna go it changes like the wind you know it changes like the weather in Auckland always you know it can be four seasons in a day you know it's like that we don't need to let's look at eternal things so that's why the children of Israel they were happy one day they were grumpy the other day but it just complaining constantly actually erodes your faith brother Graham says so so their faith was actually taken from them by their own complaining I mean but there were others in the camp that weren't like this you know we don't want to just go with the mob amen sure we are we are sheep but we don't want to go with the mob hallelujah we want to go the Lord's way amen that's what we need to do now he sees this brother Graham says us and the way to have fellowship God has to give it in love produces a fellowship now when God said back there the day that sin had separated that divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat of these certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice strife and envy is that right what happened they separated from divine love and when you separate from divine love and you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more you've got to bawl him out for it that's right you can't overlook sisters mistake no more because you got away from that divine part that love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus now notice what he's saying he's not saying if you really love your brother or sister if you really love the Lord Jesus if sister or brother does something to you well oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that Christ had Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing so it's this love between God and man will actually give love this way right it's not love this way it gives love this way it's actually your love with the Lord well we'll we'll fix this I mean but that's the problem see love love is just a word today it's not a reality I mean but but if we stay in divine love then you can overlook the faults of your brothers and sisters because love covers a multitude of sin but as I said before if this only needs to be talked to dealt with you got to do that right so I'm not saying just sweep everything under the rug and just ignore it no no things are going to be talked about if they need to be talked about right but but if if we really love the Lord then you'll love each other amen now Jesus would not permit his disciples to preach the gospel until they received the Holy Ghost yet they had been honored to walk with him three and a half years though they were holy men accepted an aside but he would not let them go preach until they waited up there and got all the differences out of them and then the Holy Ghost came what the world needs today is that same feeling when the dumping out comes it needs a filling I mean what does the filling do when it comes in where you had doubt it brings faith now now I'm building up to those who are the prisoners of Jesus Christ right we've talked about the ten trimming ones it's done okay we'll move on because I don't believe I'm looking to people who are a heads you know as a phrase around our house as well yeah you know this week don't be an a hair back yes you know oh boy you know and I've got to remember that - don't be an Ahab lord help me you know but so so so so we're going this way now now so we're we have doubt it brings faith I mean we're you have indifference it brings love I mean so if you're indifferent empty it out and get love let us say Lord take my indifference away take my your people get so guarded and litter and they get become indifferent and cold don't become that way he's now been hurt too many times with look and he'll the hurt holy remember we're not meant to be walking bunkers you know you know I think I've seen this before but but I've been in an admiral yammamoto who was the leader of the Japanese and the southwest Pacific in World War two I've been in his bunker and Papua New Guinea it's not a nice place it's a bunker it's concrete and it's just it's dark and you know it's not nice and you can't it's not very big it's about as big as this room it's about two rooms this big not very big you know it's a bunker and that's how some people they become an air Christian walk they put up sandbags they put up some mint and it's reinforced cement they dig down they have you know machine-gun posts and you know they're just hiding away there's not how we meant to be it's but it's all because of hurt people become that way we're not meant to be living in a bunker Chris Shay's Minh to be walking the green grassy fields of God's Word enjoying the sunlight I mean having fellowship rejoicing every promise just walk over pick it up payment rejoice Amen isn't that right it should be a bunker mentality I mean because remember a rut if you know you know people get stuck in a rut well a rut the more it's driven in can become a ditch and a ditch can become a trench and if you keep digging where you can just make it into a bunker don't get stuck in a rut you know I think it was um I can't remember his name brother from Canada said you know a rush is just a grave with both ends kicked out yes there's a good analogy we don't want to be stuck in a rut and lord help us Lord get us out you know but I feel loved what I want I have you know might just be all closed away amen so empty out your indifference there Lord fill me love we had hatred it brings fellowship yes now the Apostle Paul would say this let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus now now we're talking to the remember the effects of those having a tantrum brought death and judgment but those who are the prisoners of Jesus Christ it brings mercy and deliverance I mean but let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not equal to B I mean thought it not robbery to be equal with God sorry but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now when we think about the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ you know many times we just focus on the glory of it you know he you know he come you know he calmed the storm cast thousand-year-old Legion of Devils out of Legion you know raised Lazarus from the grave you know it did incredible you know the glory of coming out of the tomb triumphant we think about those things but his his walk wasn't all or glory what we consider glory but you know he as a man he had to humble himself to the Word of God that he had to fulfill remember the Apostle Paul would say that we would know him in the powers resurrection and the likeness of his sufferings so we all loved the resurrection part I was dead but now I live holy I got eternal life what about the likeness of a suffering spark because you got to have both you can't have one or the other right so so here he was as a man and he had to accept the Word of God that was that he had to fulfill so maybe I'll just backtrack a bit I'll just say it's our attitude towards the word will determine if we're an Ahab or a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's our attitude will either giver will bring judgment upon us or we'll receive mercy that's our attitude see a Habs attitude towards what neighbor said was his attitude towards the word he had a tantrum and it killed my boss and brought judgment upon himself right and that so the scribes and Pharisees they touch the same Lord Jesus as the woman with the bloody shoe amen blind bartimaeus called out to the same one that the scribes and Pharisees he crucify him so they both spoke to the same one one got healing one got judgment it was the attitude towards the word that that that caused them to receive what they actually received amen so so now here's the Lord Jesus he had a he could have been offended at what he had to fulfill here he is I'm at Transfiguration know maybe I'm just you know here's a man here's the god man but he was a man he went to Calvary is a man not just with one person sin but the sin of the whole world and he's gonna be mad he is mad more than any man and here is our Mount Transfiguration Elijah and and and Moses appear and it says I think in the Book of Luke that account it says and they told him what he had to accomplish with his decrease at Jerusalem so they came from another world as a voice from another world and they began to preach them saying this is what you have to fulfill and they went to Isaiah and they went to different parts of the scripture they went to Genesis chapter 3 and they begin to lay out everything he had to accomplish hallelujah now now here's here's the Lord Jesus as a man and he's being told you're going to be wounded for our transgressions you're going to be bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace will be upon you but by your stripes we will be healed you will be marred more than any man you'll be done before your accusers you'll be led as a sheep to the slaughter amen you'll be pierced in your hands in your feet you'll be rejected Amen that will mock you they'll spit on you they will despise you this is what you have to fulfill now imagine if I came to you and said now this is this is this is your next 48 hours this is this is in your schedule now will you get a fit what do you mean I'm a believer this is not done God this is not how it's gonna be look all these victories I've had look at what goes if none of those not this way that's being offended but was he offended he knew the full magnitude of what he had to do he knew it but he decided in Gethsemane not my will but thy will be done he won the victory there and he went to Calvary and he would cry on the cross my God my God was elfis akin me he died as a as a lot he died as a sinner that we would not have to die as a sinner member he took our place he had to choose he had that meant now the greatest miracle in his life that I see is not him bringing Lazarus from the grave as not even coming the storm or you know as not all those things but the greatest miracle in his life I see is he actually subjected his life to the prophecy he had to fulfill he actually took this flesh and said I'm gonna fulfill I'm gonna surrender my will over so it's not my own ability that's gonna do it it's not yes I'm power of yo y'all got a strong will and I'm gonna know he surrendered his will over and said Lord not my will he says if you're willing take this cup from me hidden no one likes to die no one wants to die life was you know but buddy but he chose he was an offended and at the journey he had to take even says for this cause I've come into the world hallelujah and he so the greatest miracle to me here but it was he subject in his own body his own spirit to the Word of God concerning him hallelujah he said well how can you do that while your own ability you can't do it but if you give your life to Him he said Lord not my will but thy will be done hallelujah then he'll take you through all the way remember he wasn't a robot he wasn't just some empty shell that had no emotion had no feeling amen he was a man he felt like a man he had a motion like any human head emotion they said law I'm gonna fulfill your word this is why I've come into the world and even Sid when he prayed other than Johnny sidled father I sanctify myself for the SH for his disciples sake for those that would still be here he had such a burden lord I want to see I want to see you affect them hallelujah this is one Holly member the effects of being a prisoner Holly we talked about those who who who have Tantrums anybody remember he he actually watch fulfilled the word then it wasn't just it wasn't him receiving mercy I mean but we would receive mercy wasn't that he would receive eternal life though he had it I mean but we would receive it Holly said well that's the Lord of glory what about those made in His image I mean what about those maintenance image that there we are are we not hallelujah by the Holy Ghost I mean we're made in His image hallelujah I mean God is looking for prisoners what are you up to Lord Jesus I'm I'm hunting prisoners what is he doing today looking for prisoners you know brother Graham said that peoples would say to him I'm American I can do this and I can do that and I can do that he says know if you're Christian you give up your rights you know we have to be willing to walk with him even if it's full of ridicule character assassination whatever it may be rejection hatred whatever we said Lord I'm walking through I mean we're through he willing said Lord you know even if the whole world despises us what are we going to know about it we're gonna be offended how are we gonna still love them now there's the challenge it's easy see it's even to say I love you because you got you know everyone treats me good it's easier to say it but when someone does not love you can you love them can you treat them with love and actually walk in their shoes amen well I just want to heap coals of fire on their head well that's the wrong motive know what if anyone in their right mind would never wish a person to go for even five seconds to help anyone in their right mind would never wish even their worse worst enemy you would never want them there God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody your only Creek connected with Christ and him only and then God can use you until then you can't what does that mean I'll leave my family know that mean I just yeah go be in the world or somewhere no you're gonna be connected with him let's have a look at a few prisoners I took the main prisoner I mean be seized it's all through the scripture it's all through the scripture remember remember this is going on let's just go back to the picture a lot of pictures this is all going on but this one guy that is not going on with this two actually will just take one his name is Caleb he's not caught up in the complaining in this and the problem with the sand and blaming complaining about the food and all the stuff and what's going on no something happened remember he was and he was in slavery like they were he was beaten like they were he would have suffered lost maybe in his extended family of a child being fed to the crocodiles like they did he suffered all those same things but something in him did not complain he did not begin to throw a tantrum a slow-burning tantrum and in when the going got tough because he was not looking at his surroundings help us Lord Jesus just now he wasn't looking at his surroundings he was looking at a promise and though he had never walked into the Promised Land at that time I don't think you know he was he was so caught up with the fact that he had an inheritance remember he was he said you know and in an even Moses or the Lord would say about him but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and has followed me fully who wants to follow the Lord fully not just a part-time Christian knows just a Sunday morning Wednesday night wherever kind of Christian but up all the time christian hali my whole heart god is yours but is it but not the convenient bus but everybody I mean him will I bring into the land we're enter he went and his seed shall possess it they mean sir he he didn't have a spirit of complaining a spirit of unbelief of yo groaning and moaning whatever he had a different spirit with him he had the Lord's spirit with him hello and that brought a faith I mean it didn't bring in unbelief and a doubt and a strife and all those things like everyone else was doing it you know that's the lamest excuse when people say we everyone else is doing it you know everyone else didn't get on the ark either apart from eight what have you got you know what you got oh everyone else's throwing tomatoes and stuff at the Arkell whatever they did making fun so they're you know no no let's not go with the crowd I don't want to just do I when else is doing it oh it's trending at the moment among the believers hold on you know we want to just walk with the Lord I mean we don't want to make factions and and be clannish and cliques and whatever more you know this goes beyond color race nationality age doesn't matter God's not interested in that he's looking at a seat he's look at a pre-decide see that's this important thing amen and we should be the same way because never we get caught up on what's going on in the world we will not discern the body of the Lord and we want to be able to discern the body of the Lord which is you and I by the way amen so so he had a different spirit with him even though he you know he suffered the same way he went to the waters of Marah and drank them he had a bitter walk as well remember he had the Red Sea - he was there yes he he drank the bitter waters of Mara he was there amen you know he walked through the desert - he was there he had exactly the same experience as everyone else but there's a different spirit with him why because he realized he realized he had a revelation a mint that he was going to the promised land it wasn't because ah what are you guys up to were going to the promise and his Moses prays delicious go along short happens that I he had a revelation amen he had an inheritance hallelujah he had he had a revelation I mean that he had a mountain I mean so instead of doubting and complaining no he was is strong in the promise you know I've done it before but just imagine if you go now it's nighttime there in the wilderness you know there's the tribes and camped around the tabernacle and imagine goes into the complainers tents what's the team Ouma mana you know eat your mana you know but this complaining there's and it's not just the children you know just goes to the parents and you know just the whole thing and then those talk about the sand and the heat and then and and the sunshine and why are they in Goshen anymore in Goshen was so much better in there yeah I remember the fleshpots and the leeks and the onions and all the oil was so good remember the yeah yeah you know the salmon rise over the Nile was so beautiful and they forgot their children with me to that you know thrown in there you know but they just complain and it always go why this and why this and this is wrong and this is wrong what an atmosphere to live in what an atmosphere but then we'll go into Caleb's tent and they and they put the man on the table or how they did that bow their heads and thank Jehovah God thank you Lord we're not in slavery anymore thank you you set us free our taskmasters died in the Red Sea we watch them drown Amen Lord you led us there you've led us now your puller fires over the tabernacle I mean you're speaking through your servant I mean you've revealed to us that we're going into an inheritance and then maybe the children would say Danny what was it like this is the bedtime story well son it was beyond anything why was it because the mountains were bigger because the waters were rivers were bigger why that's more than that son see there's a secret in that inheritance son it's more than honey and milk and it's flowing with it what is it what is it what does another more than that son there's a resurrection in that place you see why we're carrying Joseph's bones why are we carrying those bones daddy because he was a prophet and he knew that there was no resurrection and in in Egypt he could have had the biggest permit simple cut whatever he he could add the fanciest one but he didn't want to be put in that fancy term he want to be buried in a case he wanted to be buried in the promised land Oh daddy are we gonna go live there daddy yeah we're gonna go look the heck are we gonna die there daddy you have the Lord will Terry we're gonna die there what's gonna happen then daddy was the seat of a woman's gonna come I heard Moses speaking out of inspiration it was written down the other day Holly where where literally he was transported back into the Garden of Eden he saw the first judgment and judgment was poured out upon the serpent and the devil but mercy was given to Adam Alleluia and Eve hallelujah and there's a promise at the scene of the woman's gonna come what's gonna happen in Danny hallelujah oh my I feel good hallelujah hallelujah what's gonna happen he's gonna come to the earth I don't know exactly he's gonna be like a prophet like unto Moses that's all I know but he's gonna undo I mean this a death will have no part of us anymore how they were gonna resurrect alive Kyler your daddy I want to go live in that land we're going there children were gone there I believe the Prince the law would just come to the tent say children there's more than a story Holly it's more than a nice idea I'm here to bend to keep my word in your life I'm here to come and prove it then finally 40 years of testimony among his family we're going Laurie we're at that closer holler here where's that closer hallelujah Caleb be getting old arm and a closer hallelujah now look at my age I'm getting closer and eventually hallelujah they crossed the Jordan Holly daddy he's hit way across I told you would cross highway oh did they take Jericho there's another prisoner in Jericho it's amazing what people get out of God it's amazing God has Richard mercy the scripture tells us he's Richard mercy I mean there's no financial crisis in heaven where where the commodity of mercy goes down and goes up he's rich amen he can't run out of mercy but it's those that look for mercy find mercy I mean those unfortunate look for judgment because of criticism they get judgment but those that look for mercy they get mercy it's amazing his rehab she's not the up-and-up in the city she she's the out washer Society hey bunkie maybe more than just two meters because of social distancing from her you know cuz of what she does if I knew what she did but they all heard the testimony of what God did in Egypt they all heard the same story and I was weeping over this last night said Lord how on earth did she know there was mercy / how did she know it because they all heard the same that you said I'm good all the head was judgment let's well I think I've got it here somewhere verse two oh wait first one obvious non sigh of - and she said unto the mean this is the spies I know that the Lord has given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us even was on each they were scared didn't matter how big their armies looked and matter how their King would predict himself and where the world power of the day and do it earlier I mean no no they were this guys Tara had fallen upon them they knew that their that their time was coming to an end and that all the inhabitants of land faint because of you but we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you and when you came out of Egypt and what he did what ye did unto the two kings of the amorite so that were on the other side of Jordan si Han and all Kumi Asli destroyed imagine imagine that you know because news would have carried by courier or maybe traders would come through and you know someone would come into Jericho did you hear about what happened at the Red Sea what happened well he was Pharaoh and his army too might have Egypt off now the superpower of the day nothing could match them why would they dare they were chasing their slaves they had a slave revolt in Egypt how did they ever escape well there's an 80 year old man with a stick and he came down into Egypt he said let my people go and God began to play Egypt the God that he said met him it wasn't just talk God came and the and the mouth Nile turned to blood and there are frogs and fleas and darkness and all these things then finally they got out or they must have escaped no God got them out God got them out and then what happened they came to the edge of the Red Sea well they must have been a massacre they just must have massacred decimated the slaves broken their will and brought them back Oh No the Red Sea parted what do you mean it parted that just No Betsy's deep man will be having ships there and yours is deep no no parted well did they get stuck in the mud no it was dry ground oh yeah just a reporter talking up stuff right you know is just your hyperbole you know just try and get a good a good you know training on the website no no it actually happened and then what happened well the Israelites went through and then what happened Pharaoh and his army cancer i they just must have massacred them and they're in the sea I know what happened he raised this stuff and the sea closed over and drama you mean they drown the might of the Egyptian army yeah God did where are these people and you know what happened after that know what happened you know the king king or king oh he's big and powerful or nice his name is augur sounds scary you know he's an amirite he what happened what happened to him they fought them oh they must have beat them because his slaves you know they just came no no they got ugly destroyed this is the news that would have been slowly coming in to Jericho where are these people coming are they just over there they all new member this is what this is how this is the mood of the people in Jericho they all knew they were under judgment and if and if these people could destroy all them how they going to stand but there was a woman there she didn't throw a tantrum she didn't throw a tantrum I mean but she somehow knew that if he was a god of judgment he was a God of mercy also it was revealed her I don't know how it worked up as you said now hallelujah therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show me kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token that ye will save a life my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters that all that you have I mean all that they have and deliver our lives unto from death live them from death somehow because somehow she knew he's Richard mercy all she heard about was judgment there were no Gentiles you know you know she's a Gentile she's under judgment have you ever put yourself there somehow she knew Lord it must be mercy and all this destruction that's going on and Azrael coming out and they're coming this way it must be a mercy that I can receive and as as I seek God is Richard mercy and if you're looking for mercy you will receive mercy hallelujah because he's red channet Amen she was looking she was looking at she found mercy hallelujah and it's amazing you know the walls came tumbling down her house was on the top of the wall the scripture says the walls fell down flat and her house was preserved everything he just withdrew he went down to ground level saving and the destruction she was kept safe way because she looked for mercy I pray to God we're looking for mercy this morning I mean we just not taking him for granted but he is rich and mercy he is rich and deliverance hallelujah hallelujah she somehow knew that there was mercy and she found mercy hallelujah amen Joshua didn't throw a tantrum he became a prisoner they conquered Elijah he had his weak spots and his walk he would even pray against the will of God he said Lord take my life I'm just I'm no good and God had already in his mind oh you're gonna take your flaming chariot ride chariot of fire you're gonna be taking a body change you know a rapture he would he would be praying against God's will for his life so he had his weak spots but he became a prisoner to the Word of God he didn't throw a tantrum hallelujah he took a rapture amen our Lord Jesus I said surrendered his will to the Word of God for his life I mean the Apostle Paul would stand before King Agrippa and he'll begin to relate the visitation on the road to Damascus and he would write to Timothy about in joy as a soldier and he would tell about being shipwrecked and being destitute and you know being being being beaten and stoned in all those troubles that he had hallelujah but because he was a prisoner it's amazing when Paul wrote Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ it wasn't a nice term what title can I give myself today that's impressive no no no he experienced what it was like to be a prisoner showing the power of the blood hallelu showing the power of the salvation we have received that he went through all kinds of manner of trouble false brethren Antichrist spirit everything coming ISM but he said to King Agrippa but I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision I mean remember we've been called will be called to fulfill the word hallelujah we've been called that this word would manifest in our lives I mean we're here amen to run this final lap hallelujah I'm glad we have life in our bodies I'm glad we have strengthen our bodies I mean that Lord would you would take us for his glory you manifest his glory out of us not because we're anything but because he is everything Amen to us like brother enforce it on on on Wednesday Amy but when you let God be God amen but but but when you try and take the situation under your own control that's going to end up in Ricker's but when you let God be God let him take control of every situation then he can step on the scene and do what he wants to do hallelujah and when any believer comes to God he becomes God's attribute of his word he is used to manifest the word that's promised for that day see that's right god richard mercy has never left us without a testimony he is richard mercy you know it's very easy to yeah we can go through the heroes of faith say praise the Lord our prisoners hallelujah we go through the prophets life but now we're here now we're here they've run their race they're done if they could stand here for a few moments they would be screaming at the top of their lungs as two glorious tumors they would try and describe what it's like to go to glory what it's like there brother haven't seen it so sublime sublime can't even touch it as perfect as beyond language you know you can't express how does he says whatever you do don't miss it lay aside everything else but just don't miss it he says only divine love can get you there that's the Holy Ghost but they would they would maybe try to express how great it was to be there but God is looking for prisoners I might just leave this kind of chopped ups think just for that statement God is looking for prisoners it's a big difference between being a believer and being a believer with the Holy Ghost if you're just a believer you'll fall and fail but if you know him you may fall but you'll get back up and you'll overcome we can't emphasize enough the supernatural and how strong and powerful our God is in keeping us walking with Him irrespective of the journey you say you know if we all went back five years and we actually thought how our life would be up to this point I doubt very much we would even be close to what has happened but God knew where we would be God knew where we would be and God has ordained our steps but it's our reaction to it everything in life will make us better
