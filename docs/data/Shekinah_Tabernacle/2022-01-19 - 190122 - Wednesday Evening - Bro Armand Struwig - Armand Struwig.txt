[Music] he thought about you above all he thought about me above all he was you on the mind of christ when he was hanging on that cross and tonight once more i'm just asking as we come here before the lord god enter in get your blessing don't just warm up you enter in get your blessing don't be left behind don't stay on the other side of the river enter into the promised land this is your night god's talking to you make it personal hallelujah make it personal we serve a personal god we serve a loving god we serve a great god and that that god has come to visit you tonight and i hope in that time that when he visit you may make it so real to you tonight that you know that god has touched you this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes i'm not here to preach i'm here to step out of the way so god can have preeminence can you pull and he can answer can you ask and you will receive can you knock and he will open the door tonight is your night church we never come here to play games we're in a day where we are in a great war and there's a massive raging battle out there and we are fighting an enemy that has no mercy and he is ready but you know what our god is more than able hallelujah so if you can just forget about yourself tonight if you can just entering tonight you will see that while living god is here i'm declaring to you now he's here he changes lives davey he takes the captives and sets them free he brings children back he's a living god we will not leave one hoof behind let's open in a word of prayer gracious heavenly father the sin is said lord we are showed up tonight and we come prepared lord to hear from you lord please speak lord take this vessel out of the way and speak lord may we touch the hymn of your garment tonight lord may we have a conference with god tonight lord may you speak to us tonight lord in such a personal way lord that we will never walk the same like you touch jacob lord never be the same change our names lord oh lord you've got our names on the palm of your hand change our names tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray lord once more we come and just ask to be with us lord we give emotion because we love you lord and if we love you we show that we love you so lord just take over in the name of jesus christ lord i ask that you will just keep everyone's attention on you tonight and may they receive what they came to receive in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen we're going to have church tonight amen amen i don't consider myself as a preacher i consider myself as a brother and sometimes when you're a brother and you see another brother doing something it's good to tap him and say hey watch out you know and sometimes that older brother comes back to you or the younger one and taps you and say hey watch out so that's what we're here for please don't look at me because you'll miss it all look at him amen i'm sitting right there before sister margie tonight i'm preaching to myself because this was given to me and i'm just going to deliver it how god gave it when you leave here i pray that what god showed me and the victory that we have in christ jesus be real to you tonight amen so let's open a and a word we're going to go to psalm 120 uh just before we really go to thank you musicians you're awesome god bless you thank you musicians i went to fielding and um i want to just give a little bit of testimony with five seconds we got to to fielding and we fellowship with brother alpha and their men and uh sometimes you wonder why am i walking where i'm going why brother ed can you turn this fault back off or just mute the fallbacks please i don't like hearing my own voice i sound so afrikaans [Laughter] so we go to fielding and then you know fielding they just they just love god and they just happy and they're such a it's a close family and we visit with brother alfond we choose some fat with him and all those things that brother moses comes and says hello and um we just we just fellowship around the world and everything that ben preaches came over the pulpit and everything that the pastor's preaching in in taranaki came over the pulpit auckland's preaching you know came over the pulpit we had um brother tezia that came over the pulpit see god is so good so now we go to church and we show up to church and brother canaan is sick he can't go to church so they don't have someone for the sound because brother alpha has to do the song leading so i thought i was going to go there to relax but they put me on the sound so who do i behold coming in the door brother phil and guess what asiv was sick they needed a bass player so brother fall slotted right in and the service continued and the sister pecked out the cheese for people and brother alpha said to i think was brother alfred moses said why do you put so many cheese in she goes oh well this is for the angels of the lord they're going to come and sit here but guess what they're all filled up and people came and and god knew before that day he knew that that was going to happen and he knew canaan was going to be sick brother cain and he knew alpha was going to be sick so he already prepared that not like us knowing but just walking and just following the leading of the lord placed you somewhere to help so that they can further the kingdom of god that's the god we serve and if you really think it's not a miracle if you think logistics and brother cabinets and logistics it doesn't happen that good brother come in there's always scope so so tonight please enter in and and you are predestinated to be here tonight god has a visitation for you tonight and if you can really receive what's coming over this pulpit you will walk out of here victorious amen okay so 120 it says david says here this is a song of degrees that's what it's titled in the bible and when i looked at the word degrees because you know my english is pretty all over the show um that word before i read it it says that it's a amount a level to the extent which something happens or is present so so david's writing this psalm and basically how i understand it is this is a very present situation he's in and so he's declaring to who's ever writing the song while he's saying it that hey i'm currently in this so state want you to note this down and this is what he notes down verse one he says in my distress i cried unto the lord and he heard me and he heard me he delivered my soul oh lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue so david had a deliverance he had a problem he was struggling and he says i just want to tell you a prison truth what's happening now god has just delivered me from that okay from lying lips in a deceitful tongue what shall be giving unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue so he knows already the biggest fight he has is with there we go amen sharp arrows of might oh it's mighty man and the cause of juniper woe is me for our sojun and misik i think it's how you say it and that i dwell in the teens of gadar my soul have long dwell with him that have peace i am for peace but when i speak they are for war amen um you can have your seed saints may the lord list this word and um i am not it's not a it's not a scolding service it is actually encouragement so so the reason i read the scripture is sometimes our tongue says one thing and our body sees another thing and our brains is another thing but that's not what god's saying so we must be really we must be really in tune with god when we do anything and we must be so sure that when we speak that it's not just us speaking but it is actually god speaking and it's hard because once you speak and i'm not going to get ahead of my but once you speak something and you release that word something's going to happen it will not come to you void something's going to happen because you set something in motion and that's why prophets had to speak the word of god and that's why the bible had to be preached because there was a word that had to go forth so as long as you remember that concept tonight children whatever you do do not get distracted this is for you as well so if you find yourself dozing off i encourage you to come back i will not like brother moses call you out her brother um i call him brother samson i won't let call you out um but i will definitely maybe pause for a sec and get your attention and my mouth is so dry praise the lord okay so my title for tonight if you can put it on and i want you to look at this title it says who am who i am so so who and the i am right so remember god in the book of genesis says i am the i am so who i am because once you understand this you can understand how god works in his people and what god does for us every day so who i am so we're going to go and turn to a little but there's a little bit of story and and i'm just going to paraphrase this and it comes out of the 6301 23 the prophet of god speaks about identification and he's talking about identifying you in the scriptures and he sees this he says it reminds me of a story of a little boy and he was and i'm going to paraphrase and he was brought up just a little boy out in the countryside somewhere pretty much like brother branham you know where they didn't have a mirror and they weren't used to all these fancy stuff he says and one day this little boy went to visit his grandma and he gets to his grandma and he walks into the house and the cupboard door's closed and behind the cupboard door's a mirror and as he walks into the house and he goes on about it and he says the boy looks back in the cupboard mirror is open and he sees another little boy and because he he's not used to a mirror he waves at the boy and the boy waves back and he goes man this is cool and he walks closer to the boy and the boy walks closer to him so then he walks right up to the mirror and he looks at the boy very hard and he goes mama mama it's me so i encourage you he goes on to say this and this is what i want today tonight do not do not shovel anything to no one i want you to go find yourself he says here in in number 39 he says here and that is what we want to look at tonight i want you to look at me and i want to look at me and i want you to look at yourself and as we look into the great mirror of god's word let us be able to identify ourselves with someone that is going to speak about something and something of the characters of the other times and i want to see myself in god's looking glass because if i if anything will show me where i am standing in this book there is no book like this because this is all the truth he says it says and i know this one is true and it's the truth because it's the word of god now jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at and he reflected his life through this word that we should see and we should look into god's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example so before we go any further with the service i encourage you don't look at anything else but what we're telling you tonight in the word find yourself tonight in this great commission that we're talking about i'm gonna talk about joshua and and i had such a jubilee and we can stay in this book forever seriously it's such a good book because it we under that joshua commission and i'm gonna try my best to follow my notes because if i jump ahead i'm going to maybe forget something so please bear with me if i pause because i want to deliver it as the lord gave it to me and then after that whatever god does that is up to him so if we look at joshua the first chapter and we start there from verse 1 and he says and i'll just read it for you you can follow me along we're going to stay in that book tonight so now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over the jordan thou and all the people into the land which i do give unto you even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon i have i have given unto you and i said to moses and i said unto moses for the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen so now i'm going to just step away from it and say okay believing is for believers god's promises is for believers no one else okay the promises is for everyone but only the ones that grab it is believers so i want to encourage you if god says something you have to take that and believe it because before joshua before god spoke to joshua here moses sent the spies out and they came back with a report of believing they could do it now i don't want to go through the whole book and god saw that and he said i can work with that man because i want my plan of redemption to roll out but i need someone to do it and joshua was the one to say i can do it so he said the words the report he gave back to moses was we are more than able so his words is saying what god's heart is longing hence why our words care are you guys our words is speaking what god is longing so a prayer meeting is not just a prayer meeting it is god's heart expressed through a man put into words so it can go grab a promise and bring it to pass that's the word of god so that's his action plan now see when god spoke to joshua right there they were not in the promised land yet they haven't crossed the river jordan so they haven't gone over yet so joshua has gotten this promise from the lord he grabbed onto the promise and he says to the spies hey i'm going to send two spies go check out the land go make sure when you look at the land you go all the way also to jericho just go cover that and i'm just paraphrasing because i don't want to to read too much he says but i want to say this and this is romans 8 that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that walk after the flesh do mind the things of the fleece but they that walk after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be kindly minded as death but to spiritually mind it is life and peace now joshua and caleb didn't have life and peace they are death and war in front of them if you really think about it you say life and peace let's go peace so nothing happens to me nothing's going to happen to me i'm just going to cruise through it all and it's just going to be life and peace wherever i go you have life and peace because you know where you stand but it doesn't mean at that very situation that you're in a loving and a peaceful situation bear that in mind because your enemy he thinks because he gets you to be a bit frustrated he's got one on you you still have peace you still have life for the i am is in you amen so we go on and i'm going to tell the story of of joshua and i'm just going to do it my way so please bear in mind so it ties in the way how how joshua fought his campaign because because he didn't see anything carnally he was just walking on the promises of god it was jay and i mean for him he didn't see the challenges he just saw let's walk on god made a promise god can keep his promise because he knew the i am was with him okay because now remember god made him a promise so god is if god makes a promise he will not break his word he cannot break his word so now the second chapter verse one and joshua the son of nun sent out to shed him two men to spy secretly because or else they're not spies okay you know they don't come into jericho going hey boys god said we're going to take over this place no they sneak in okay but now where do they go where do these guys go they go and they view all the land of jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house a lady that is unclean because the only people that can receive them is a sinner because they came with a message i hope you catch it they are under a prophet ministry but they came with a message and that message was the mercy of god revealed for rahab's time because there was a little harlot called rahab and she lodged there and she saw what was busy happening around her she didn't understand because nobody before that part of the sea and walked through it you know and with the kings of og and all those guys before they were utterly destroyed so she knew something was coming away that's greater that what she had at that moment because she realized something and i don't want to jump ahead and then the king of jericho he goes and he goes and looks for those spies and because she's got a little bit of hope and she's got something she takes that messengers and she hides them because she knows that there is life in this message that just came away she knows that before there was only death because everybody just judged her everybody just saw her as a harlot she had a name she had a pass she had all those things but these messengers didn't care about those things they just come to say hey we're spying out the land there's a great army coming and you either for us or against us so that's the message the same message of the hour now there's a rapture coming you're either going or you're staying it doesn't change if you want it receive it if you want to go into a rapture you receive it because remember the message is still preached by the messengers brother ben he's a messenger okay he gives a message he's still under the pro the prophet okay he's still under the ministry of a prophet which god opened the word but he's just standing here and he's giving you a message and if you can receive that you got life if you can receive that you got life amen don't want to go over it but now realize that these spies now gives ray up that mission okay so and she hides them now she wants something back you know she wants something back because we don't we don't serve god just because we're christians i want something back i want rapture i want i want peace i want love i want patience meekness gentleness kindness long suffering i want overcoming power i want to be the full manifestations of the sons of god on this earth i have a purpose god has given it to me and he says it's yours you just have to show up that's what i want you know i i'm gonna sidetrack you i'll come back to that i might just say it i went for an interview today and i was sitting in the interview and it's and it's in our company and they say what do you want to be it's a loaded question okay [Laughter] i said in what context they go oh no in this company i said ah okay well let's just put a d but when he said it something he said to me is i wanna be he's i wanna be that one that stands in the devil's way every day and go you don't go further i want to be that testifies of god's goodness i want to see miracles i want to see people heal i want to see people raised up from the dead i want to see cancer be defeated i want to be that guy because he made me a believer and i was sitting there and i thought really in the greatest scheme of things what do i want to be i don't want to be here i so don't want to be here you know but we sometimes have to hold back because you must be ready to win the fire or we're not the fire okay but man what a loaded question he almost had me there i was about to close but man what a question that's not my new favorite question what do you want to be so now joshua 2 and we go to verse 12. now she identifies she identifies there's something and she goes and she says now therefore i pray you she's speaking to the spires now remember rahab is not talking to god here okay she's talking to two human beings okay she's talking to people that showed up on a door knocked and said hey please either the king wants to kill us okay she's not talking to god here she's talking to people and i'm telling you again she's talking to people so see the importance of what comes out of our lips it brings death or life i'm not going to jump ahead and she says since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a a true token and that you would save a life my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death so she makes this petition to a person has no power no jurisdiction he's a human which words fell upon his ear but see because they she did something it was inside of them something said [Music] i hear that i hear that okay we go on and they the children of gr god and the and the bride of christ that's what we are now i'm asking you how many times us as brothers and sisters moms and dads asked for something from god and think he didn't hear or was busy talking to a brother and sister and pouring your heart out and crying your eyes out and think he didn't hear who says that who told you god didn't listen it's a lie doesn't mean it happens in another season or in another time of your life that god ain't listening he's listening amen he's mindful okay so be careful when you speak and then very five minutes after that proclaim the opposite of what you just asked for because what you see is what i asked the spies doesn't matter rayab didn't go with that attitude she was a believer and she knew the only thing she could do the only way to reach god right now is to speak to these people which is in my house talking about him the only way out so don't think you can't speak to a brother or sister don't think you can't come up here and and talk to the pastor and god doesn't hear that you don't need a aw moment for god to be on the scene you need two he says for two or more gathered in my name there i am and you don't even need to because if you go into your prayer closet he is there so don't ever doubt that he does not hear you amen so remember these spies they were under a promise okay so god speaks to joshua the prophet brother branham brother branham goes to the messengers and say hey this is how god wants it go seek out the land they just show up with that message and they just preach that message and she speaks to those people which comes back to joshua now and they give the account back to joshua not god to joshua and they say hey while we were in the land there was a harlot called rahab that hit us but she asked something she asked for a family and they give the account back to him now again i'm coming back was this where people get brother branham and god mixed up brother branham was a prophet of this hour and he preached a message and god used him and whatever brother branham did god used him for it don't look at the veil because if it stopped at joshua then raya would have been dead it must go to god you must meet god not our prophet you must meet god the ministry introduces him the minister is talking about his peace his promises he's telling you how to overcome he gives you all the things you need to walk in this walk but that don't mean he's god that just means god used him you need to meet jesus christ our savior and that's the one that should be personal and if you can feed as much as you can of the word of god because brother branham said this is your identity and i listen to brother branham and all i hear is he's pointing me back to this word and said don't worry there's more because other preachers when i'm really segwaying now other preachers when i was out in the world never told me about sin they dance around sin you could sin as much as you like just go back to god and say i'm sorry and you're right it's a lie unconfessed sin will take you to hell because what unconfessed sin does it gives you a card and satan says you know what there you've done this deed take that okay thank you do you want that so because if he gives it to you and you get to the white throne judgment he pulls that out of your pocket and he goes ah you did this because he's got something held against you now because you didn't bring it to the open and it wasn't thrown under the blood he can attribute to it to if there's any unconfession in your life get rid of it it's not worth no matter how he lies to you to take that with you because all he's going to do is going to take it out of your pocket and it's going to give it right back at you because he's the accuser of the brethren and you know what he's really good at it because all he has is lies in the seat and if you hold on to lies and deceit he will use it in your life that wasn't part of the service so that's for someone so under a promise was made to joshua now these spies if we go there to here if we go to verse 18 it says behold when you come into the land thou shall bind this line of scarlet threat onto the window so now these these these messengers and and we're going to read that this mission just actually tells back while joshua's still on the other side of the promised land he's not indeed in the other side of jordan they only in the promised land they busy telling ray up hey look at this when we come and they bind the scarlet line the street in the window which thou didst lead us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren all the father's house unto thee he says and it shall be and it shall be what that whosoever shall go out of your doors of the of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless so what this is big words you know they don't know how the battle is going to go they two people in a massive battle they two people in the whole army of of joshua if you really think about it that's coming to a harlot's house and giving them a promise so who's your preacher standing you're telling you about the promise of god if there's so many other preachers out there what makes him right god is busy using him god is busy speaking because the reason we're all in this church is because god uses whoever's in this pulpit speaking that message to talk to us that's why we're not in all the churches we follow a pastor and god bless our pastor because sometimes the word comes over the pope and it's so it hurts so much but it heals because if you could take that word back to god you are under a promise because no way do i know that anybody would stand here and speak anything contrary to what god gives them amen because they will be held accountable for that remember why there is preaching it's for our benefit amen that's why you tell your kids of the whole time i do it a lot sorry reuben he says for their house his blood shall be upon upon his head he says and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in thy house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him now remember again i'm going to say they said this when they were still on this side of the jordan because what it says after that is they went and crossed the river jordan again and they went to joshua and they spoke to joshua and they gave them an account so please kids raise your hands all the kids all the children raise your hands come on malakai i know you can there we go okay and put them down i'm talking to you it's not something that's above you this is a great wall man this is this is something that that this world doesn't understand there was a war fought with the spoken word yeah oh man i just can't understand it sometimes okay we'll get there it was a shout by the way a great show so joshua chapter 5 and verse 1. so now now the faith is going to be put into action because god now said be very courageous and let's cross the water um and and i'll get to that no i think i skipped that note let me just double check quickly so i don't want to skip that man technology the reason i don't like a phone everybody's still here saying me who loves the lord amen so we've got ray up accepting a promise and uh here we go okay i'm back on track okay we had pastor ben in there as well and under prophet's message and the messenger's response and now all things are possible to them that believe now here we go and now look chap go to that first verse now joshua goes through the the jordan now god had to show joshua that he was with him as he was with moses because he said to him in the first chapter as i was with moses so shall i be with okay so god had to do something for joshua so the people around him could see that i was with you so now joshua starts walking and he commands the priest he says go into the river jordan and what does he do he parts the waters so now all those people look and say wow this happened before and they walk over on dry land and he commands them to take the 12 stones to be as a token or a sign that this is what's happened because god was with him and he got each one of the tribes of of israel to go and pick up a stone and put it on as a as a as a heritage as a sign for the generation forward that it's the same message i hope you catch this now it's the same message that paul preached same message same thing and then god moves on and says now i'm gonna get joshua to put you in the land same message that came okay that paul preached brother branham went past the curtain of time when he was standing there what did he said he said is paul going to be judged for everything he preached and then the angel of the lord says to him yes he says good because i preached what paul preached and all of us yes i'm going to say it again all of us said we count on that brother branham that's what i rest on because i'm not following evil devised little cult thingy wings what people make i don't follow lies i follow the word of god because everything that was preached in that message came back to this book not outside of the scope it's not outside of the book it's all in there okay so now let's get serious so now and it came to pass when the kings and the amorites on the other side win which were on the other side okay it was on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of the jordan before the children of israel until we were passed over that their hearts melted and there was um and the end there was their spirit what neither was there a spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel okay now i'm gonna gonna bring to you it just like the lord said i hope you receive it that way so you walk in the footsteps where god leads you amen you got children you're praying for you've got love once you're praying for moms and dads people that look that they're really outside of the economy of god do you know that that demon sitting right there deceiving them is scared of you don't look at the veil don't look at the reaction don't look at the circumstance don't look at the fight back the kick back the arguments don't look at that do you know that because if you're under the commission of the lord and you're walking as the lord is guiding you that demon is scared of you because these kings as much as they rallied if you go to chapter nine they all rallied together okay after jericho fell they all rallied together against israel why because they were scared and once you walked your way with the lord and you chose to walk with the lord it seems like all hell breaks loose in your life but it's because the enemies are scared because they know who is with you [Applause] they know is with you amen amen joshua 5 verse 11 and they did eat of the old corner of the land and of the morrow after the past over unleavened cakes and parched corn in the south same day okay and the men are seized in the morrow so now god makes it difficult i mean we were fed our shoes were good our clothes weren't wore out i get into the promised land and you stop my food and it's getting hard and all of a sudden people don't like me and and people that used to be my friends walk away from me and loved ones that's close to me is kicking against me and all these things are happening why because god is making you ready for war for war not your brother and sister not the one that's kicking back for that thing that is sitting there that's scared of you but if you are in baby mode and you're just drinking milk in honeymoon mode who is ever on a honeymoon nobody else matters than your sweetheart you're just in love so if somebody would have attacked you say i want your wallet you want to go yeah yeah there you go have that one yeah just don't touch my love you wouldn't fight someone says i'm going to take your life you'll go yeah okay we'll get there now can i just she's so beautiful because you're in love but see god has to he has met you you you've chosen the way through water baptism which is the water okay in the name of jesus christ you chose your way you get through that water and boom all the hell eats you and you're thinking man what's going on can i not get a break all i come here is for peace love love long suffering meekness gentleness kindness and all i'm getting is pushback you're right where you're supposed to be you are right where you're supposed to be because god is training you for a greater battle than to be fought just with the sword because the sword cuts both ways and it can kill and it can heal be careful we're not here to fight with the word of god we're here to surrender to the word of god amen i've seen a lot of bible punching in my life that just doesn't get you anywhere hey brother head so god took it all away and now they started eating of the fruit of the land that year okay which is also nice because once you go through a trial man does it feel nice to just kick the devil in his face say he comes back but one time one time god delivered someone or one time when it spoke a season somebody came back and said man god you spoke to me through you thank you i've got hope i've got i've got something to hold on to we had a lady at work and i'm paraphrasing or going off it again she said please help me because immigration doesn't want us to stay here and and in december the 12th she should have been out of the country what do i do i said don't listen to the obvious say to it just like that don't listen and believe what this is currently stating see i said are you a believer she goes yeah i'm a believer i said okay so you believe hey yeah so you think the almighty god that created heaven and earth cannot sign your document and give you a residency she goes i needed that i said well then take it don't just sign needed that and don't take it proclaim it speak it i said because it's easy to say the obvious it's hard to see the unseen and it's hard to speak the unseen when the obvious is right in front of your face look at the unsee and sorry if we're dragging on but we're going now the rest of the camp of israel god stops everything and now they're fighting for everything and it came to pass verse 13. now here i wanted this is this is where it is and we all know this piece may god make it so real to you right now so joshua walks out in the morning in the morrow and he's walking and he's looking at jericho yeah and he thinks battle logistics how's this gonna go of course guess what the first verse of the next one will go there now i said okay wait wait so he looks at this okay just remember i'm gonna come back to that remind me of what he saw and it came to pass joshua by jericho he lifted his eyes and looked up and behold he stood a man over him against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went to him and said i thou for us or for our adversaries now all your moms and dads this is for you husbands wives this is for you and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the lord i now come and joshua fell on his face onto the earth and he did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto thy servant and now god look how how perfect god is yesterday today and forever the same he says to him and the captain of the lord of the host said unto joshua lose thy shoe from thy foot for the place where on our stand is holy amen so he's proving to joshua that what i said to moses and all the accounts before egypt before you even got this promised land when i met jo um moses i said to him loose thy shoes off i'm that same one i am the i am there is no greater than me and if you fall down in humility god can act on that though he tells you i'll take over though he comes because of just a previous verse he says i'm here to take over but just before you get all arrogant and think hey i've got it take your shoes off in humility because we're not going to fight it your way we're going to fight this fight my way okay amen so tonight the captain with the sword draught comes to each one of us and he's telling us if your demon that is against you say you cannot get over him i'm telling you you're right but i can i can get over that thing i can overcome i can create i am the i am i will show you things that you don't know about if you could just let go i can don't tell me what i can't do because my sword is drawn and my sword brings peace life and death to anyone that is against the word of god but he does the work as zealous as we are we cannot do that work we can just surrender amen now joshua chapter 6 and here it comes verse 1. now you got that teenager you got that child that brother that you know that is 45 years old and he knows everything about everything or that dad in my case and dad forgive me because i'm just using a testimony that just don't want to budge no matter how much you throw the word at him he does not want to budge and it says and jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel because of who because of you and none went out and none came in so your teenager is standing there and there is a demon sitting right in him saying i don't believe the word of god and you know what i ain't coming out hey i don't believe what you're telling me mom and dad and i'm preaching it to myself because i did exactly the same when i was there my parents tried to convince me and i convinced myself otherwise because there was something in me that was defying that and i said i will not be moved now if you look at this state how's those walls going to come down how are you going to reach those peoples because remember we when we and we're going to get to what what what joshua said but remember when they now starting to go and putting in an action and god says to him through joshua and he says and the lord said unto joshua i've given you i've given it into your hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of allah so god says i've given you your child are you listening i gave you your child amen he might not be budging but i gave him to you and who's going to fight this battle amen so love them love them as much as you can love anyone but don't doubt that god cannot turn them around don't doubt that and it shall compass that in the city with all the men of war go around the city once thou shalt go six days and the seven priests shall be before thee the ark and we can stay here forever so so i'm trying to get through it sorry guys um and the seven trumpets of the rams once in the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come past come to pass that when they make a long blast in the rams horn and you they hear the sound of the trumpet the people shall shout and a great shout and the wall of the city shall fell down flat now have you noticed god said nothing about rayam you're following everybody still here amen okay let's all stand up quickly thank you amen we're almost there we're about to close okay and sit down and the people say praise her amen because he's here and he's worthy of all praise so now remember look at this god in this plan which he gives to joshua he says this you shall do but nowhere in this whole thing before the day do i find anything he says about rehab so okay how are my child's going to be saved i don't know i have all these promises but when when god which chapter am i in where in my walk am i with you when is this going to happen god says don't worry about it just go forth here we go to the next one no and this hang on now they put it into action and the seventh day the priest was bearing the seventh um uh rams horns before the ark and we're going to go now to john 6 13 please and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of the rams horns before the ark of the lord went on continually and blew the trumpets and the armed men went before them but um but the reward came after the ark of the lord and the priests going were blowing the trumpets and the second day came to pass and the city wants and they returned to the camp so they did for six days now here is rahab and she's looking at the spectacle so day one a family's in the house and the children of god is marching no sound no sound they do nothing's happening now remember she only had the word of the messengers she didn't have it thus save the lord she didn't have your child is saved it didn't come from a supernatural source it was two guys saying we oath that we will not kill you you will not die just put the robe out so year by day six you cannot tell me that she was either very excited or very worried because no spies came in and stole them away nothing was happening so i preached to my children and i preached to my children and i preached to my children but nothing is happening and i'm praying to god and i'm praying to god and i'm praying to god and nothing's happening but you're only on your sixth day it's not the seventh day for you yet okay so don't lose hope hallelujah and of course now you've got the people in jericho all those demons just laughing going haha six days you did nothing you bunch of scaredy cats that's what they said like come on they look at israel israel's going around once and then they go off and they're going like seriously go on these guys fight we got these walls we impenetrable you shall not move me but god had another vision and now here comes the here it is boys wake up children brother sisters it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose up early and of the dawning of the day and they composed as verse 15 the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they could pass the city seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets joshua joshua the prophet shouted he shouted and listen what he says he says for the lord have given you the city and the city shall be accursed so don't go into the world children it's accursed prophet said you can't serve god and mammon stay with god it's a curse and whatever you're going to go find out in the city you bring it back home it's gonna cost you a whole lot of trouble i've been there oh yeah still some sweeping out some trouble sometimes he says for therefore he says even it and all that are therein unto the lord to the lord so he's saying everything in that city is a curse to the lord he wants nothing to do with that but only rahab and the harlot shall live she and all that is with her in the house because she hit the messengers that were sent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing there's your warning stay out of it you cannot serve two gods you can't be you can't you can't say i love the message but and i want to do everything else love god walk with god if he corrects you walk with god don't go find some other stuff because you'll only get into trouble ask aiken and his whole family that was destroyed don't go there he says and make the camp of israel a curse or trouble it so he's warning them don't go into the world because what you get in the world you bring back here and if you want to have unity in this camp and we don't people want to die don't bring worldly manners and worldly statements and worldly ways of thinking into this church because here we are spiritually minded we think about god we think about the promises of god the prophet of god says if thou can believe all things are possible what does the world seize days and miracles are over you bring that in here you will never never get healed never if you follow opinions of a man and you come into this church and and something that someone did they said i agreed with brother ben until he preached that well you didn't listen to god because it wasn't brother ben preaching so when you come here be corrected leave all those other things around men's opinions and you know there was one time i and i'm gonna i'm about to close so there was one time where um someone told me that david had two stones in his hand before he went to goliath because the other four stones represented hope so i heard that and i said that's a lie i said the bible said he had one stone in his end i said and before he went to goliath he prophesied i'm gonna i'm gonna kill you and i'm gonna cut off your head with my sword he didn't have show he wasn't hoping he had faith and with faith he knew he can overcome that he only needed one because the other four was for his brothers so so when we hear things like that and we start believing those things it's taking away from what is really the truth and it makes everything a watery washing down thing and you can do exactly just what you do as long as just before you die you run to the altar and say god forgive me then everything's fine don't work like that many men don't get to 96 many a children don't even get to the age of seven so don't you think children you've got another 50 years ahead of you life ain't guarantee when god calls you calls you be ready be ready amen amen now out of the same mouth proceed of blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so though the fountain sent forth the same place sweet water and bitter can a fig tree many um uh my brethren be olive berries that's in james three verse twelve and figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh now i come now come down this is where my my sermon hopefully the lord will take over now and i'll read this lost if you believe you can have it okay if you are a believer and god said it's yours it's yours if you want more of god there is more of god to get please don't let this spin this speak contrary to what you believe if you claimed your healing receive your healing walk in your healing it's not mind over matter it's spoken word and the very very first sermon that that touched my heart was the spoken word why because the prophet of god showed us that we have to speak and on that god comes down and he and he sees our faith and he acts on our faith and he goes and gets the promises that he makes because this whole war of jericho when the wars fell down and rahab and everybody was still standing that was god doing it but joshua and caleb believed and it says as the walls will fall down straightway go in so the walls didn't fall there and they ran there and go in god was so mindful that while they were marching the walls were falling right in front of them and they could straightway go in and go get the enemy think about it and let's say right around the city and then go in he says just go in it's yours so if god promised you something don't go around about it just go in and claim it it's yours the walls will fall no matter how much that demon sits there no matter how much that thing defies you god said it's yours you go claim it you go claim it he says but the day has come where the gospel light is shining theology and christian churches is dying it's failed god is talking now and he's revealing himself again through his church the resurrected body of the lord jesus christ resurrected out of church empty resurrected out of cold formal churches resurrected out of fanaticism god is bringing forth a bunch of bones that is putting on skin and the power of the holy ghost that brings the gospel and these last days with signs and wonders to the end of the world they'll teach the bible they'll stand by it they will live by it they cannot compromise they will not go to the left or right they will stand right with the word and move on as god was with them daily confirming the word with signs and wonders following hallelujah stay by god stay on the word and go and get your land it's a supernatural war you cannot look with carnality you will fail you have to look with god's eyes and if anything tells you it cannot it's a lie and you just push it down and you walk on because guess what the guys that said it was a lie where that they end up it's it's where did the israelites that that said they couldn't get that land end up that gave the negative report back in the desert they died we ain't that people brothers sisters we ain't that people we are believers and if if there is something that's telling you tonight you don't need to believe it's a lie and you rebuke that spirit and you move on because god honors a man that can stand for him and a sister certificate about the woman so god bless you i'm sorry it comes out sometimes a bit strong but as the missions come from musicians come forward maybe let's just sing a song let's sing that i went to the enemies camp because because the thing is when we look at the scriptures and we look at at the prophets and all those things it's hard to believe that it actually pertains to our life but it is a type of you you know and and as much as it's a type of you the lord put it there to unlock it and soon and see the season in your life to get you to a place where god can deal with you don't bet these things no matter what you do do not bet them brothers and sisters i encourage you don't bet it it's real who wants to see miracles who has seen miracles so that miracle working god he's still here look the world's gonna always keep you busy it's always gonna be contrary to the word it's if thou canst believe amen so let's all stand up and proclaim the song and we'll just the reason i think we went to the enemies camp is who's got somebody that's in the camp who's got somebody that's captured who is somebody that's got unconfessed sin who is somebody that needs to work with the lord and say lord help me oh that's me so go to the enemy's camp get your peace get your healing get your brother get your sister get someone that wronged you get everyone get who you can out of that enemy's camp because the walls might be shut up but who can drop the walls amen let's sing that song while i went to the enemy scam what did i do and i i took back what he stole from me i took back what he stole from me i took back what he stole from me yes i went to the enemy's camp what did i do i took back what he stole from me cause he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet satan is under my feet let's sing your children i went to the enemy god yeah you [Music] what did you do take back that piece take back that temper hey man oh i went to the enemy's camp and i i took back i take my healing cause you're under my feet he's under your feet he's under your feet he's under your feet under your feet he's under yours saying it again he's under your feet he's under your feet where's satan satan is under my feet amen hallelujah amen well let's just close in the word of prayer if there's anybody tonight that the devil has been lying too much i don't think we always have to end at this very serious note because you know what god knows you and no matter how much i try to make an atmosphere i pray that god gets so real route to you i pray that the lord jesus touches you right now and he reveals to you what are you hiding [Music] because i didn't come and give this message this was the lord and i believe that the reason this is here is because these people that need to get those walls dropped down and claim their promise so let's just pray together if you have any promise that has been taken from you anything that's lying to you in the name of jesus christ i ask you lift your hands and you proclaim it to the lord and you speak to our god and you say lord i need it i need your help lord i am trapped i don't know lord what to do but i know i believe because i am under the joshua and caleb banned and lord i know that what you're going to do is fight for me and i know you're going to help me to overcome lord jesus so tonight let's pray together brothers and sisters and say lord please please have mercy father show me where we are lord show me the land lord show me where my footsteps should go lord jesus help us all as a church to buckle up lord and to get together lord and have one vision like the church of israel law they just marched forward lord and they listened to the prophet they followed the messenger's report lord which was good and they claimed their land lord lord because you said be of a courage lord we have a good courage for the land is yours i've given an unto you lord i claim our children in the name of jesus christ lord i claimed our loved ones in the name of jesus christ lord i claim every brother and sister lord that might not be here tonight lord i said lord they're yours lord you see them you know where they are lord you even know where rahab was sitting when those walls were falling you did the logistics lord your angels encamped around their house and everybody in the house was saved lord i claim my house in the name of jesus christ and everybody in my house will be saved father i'm on the commission lord i'm on a mission for you lord jesus and i walk in your will and i walk in your ways lord and i know you will not let my word return to me void lord as joshua spoke it has said harlot's house will be saved rahab will be saved lord i say our children will come lord there's children in this church father that's far away from you removed lord and the enemy is saying we can't have them back i claim them in the name of jesus christ i claim them for your kingdom lord i ask to be merciful god show us how to win them lord oh lord jesus show us how to get them back lord jesus in the name of jesus christ help us lord give us strength lord may we as the army be mighty in your word mighty in your deed lord lord may we follow after you lord jesus and i ask that you would take this battle as the captain of the host for anyone that lost hope lord that that that's that's struggling to believe tonight lord go and touch them lord may they find himself in this word lord this precious word of god oh lord jesus may they know that every blessing every promise from you is yay and amen lord lord and you will not fail us because you said i'll be with you and in you till the day that i return and lord i know that the promise is as many as far of as you will call lord jesus so i claim my children i claim my family lord i claim my brother and my sister i claim lord my my mom and dad i claim my my stepmom and dad and my other mom and dad lord and my friends in south africa i claim the people i work with lord see lord how we pray for them daily lord give us a heart of flesh father lord and protect our lips i pray thee that what we speak may bring life and what we speak will be your word father lord because the last thing i want to do is bring false into the camp of israel i do not want to bring anything out of the world back in here lord jesus i do not want to be a achin lord i want to be a true testimony in this time for you lord jesus and our lord i pray for every brother and sister here put the angels at our mouth lord lord may they guard us lord and if there's anything that i said lord is contrary to your word forgive me father you know that i am just limited in my thoughts and ideas lord and how i speak and if there's anybody that took it wrong lord may they tonight take it back to you lord i pray that you'll show them that there is hope and there is peace and there is overcoming power in your word lord you are the same yesterday today and forever and if your prophet could have miracles happen when the people start having faith lord the angel of the lord says if you can get them to believe all things are possible i pray lord that this church will have believers lord i pray that this
