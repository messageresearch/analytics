word and then something pulls you away from it just know that's the devil so just do it amen so i'm sitting there and i've been having this song on my heart for some time and there's there's just something about a good a good old-time christian there's something about that um we might be living in this modern time and you know somehow sometimes become modern christians but there's something about a good a good old christian you know that is why malachi chapter 4 wants to take us back to to be the good old-time christian there's just something about that amen and we want to sing this song maybe we start with the choruses then i believe there was no there was no you know sometimes we i get confused with keys but i believe the kids that we have today you know might have not been tuned this way when they were singing have an angel signal i don't know what keys they were going they were going in but i believe it was the holy spirit key amen and all our instruments and things they're just trying to get to that key so i decided to rather just go direct to that amen i would rather be an old-time christian than anything i know sorry forgot my classes [Music] i'm very sorry i apologize [Music] [Music] anything i know there's nothing like an old time christian with a christian love to show i'm telling everywhere i go that i would rather be an old-time [Music] and i'm happy

lunch but there's always lunch after service everyone's welcome to we've got a few cakes to eat by the sounds of it i mean a few birthdays so praise the lord so um amen if you've got your bibles handy let's just go straight to the scripture i mean i really like to thank everyone again for you know the uh for my office being renovated like to thank sister priscilla and everyone who joined in and you know it's real real i mean i think i got the fanciest place in the church and there's chocolates on my desk so if there's got some missing i'm gonna go finding you maybe i'll share them you'll see but you know there's still some left anyway uh let's go to matthew 27 and we're good then we're going to go to uh first samuel 17. so matthew 27 and and 27. then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and they put on him a scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross we're going to go to this may seem a bit um i just prayed the lord all this title together amen and then and then we're here in first samuel 17 from verse 24 this is just another familiar piece of scripture this is where david has come to join the battle and um and all of the men of israel when they saw the mans that was goliath they fled from him and were sore afraid and the men of israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy israel as he come up and it shall be that the uh that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel and david spoke to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away their approach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that should defy the armies of the living god and the people answered him after this man are saying it shall be done to the man that killeth him and elia his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and elijah's anger was kindled against david and he said why cometh thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart art thou come down that thou may see for thou come down that thou mayest see the battle and david said what have i now done is there not a cause amen may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats uh this morning and i would like to continue from last sunday speaking about how we are the lord's ambassadors upon the earth and i just want to just throw a question out there is there not a cause you know we have the cause of christ i mean we understand that there are many great there have been many great causes through history there have been many great causes you know of great you know um you know that men have literally given their lives amen for you know and and in doing so they've been great feats of heroism i mean they're the great feats of stories of human survival hardship overcoming great odds sacrifices given amen and and and we know that there are still causes today but i want to speak about the cause which is the cause for christ i mean we know if there is a cause there will be a conflict there'll be a battle and we know if there's a battle there's an enemy to contend with amen and and we must understand that that we have an enemy that we're contending with amen we know that he is a defeated being he has been conquered he was stripped of everything that day on calvary he doesn't have the keys to his own house amen he was he was reminded of this prayer line after prayer line in the prophet's ministry night after night service after service he was reminded satan an angel of god has commissioned me amen to to to cast you out wherever i find you and i'll say this we are commissioned we're under a mandate amen for the cause of christ amen that the devil will be cast out wherever we may find him hallelujah so whether you like it or not you're you're in a cause and you'll you'll adopt some cause in your life i mean there's many different causes many different voices trying to enlist you into their cause but i say i need you in the cause of christ i need you on my side i mean i can't do this alone i won't try and do it alone i need you in my in my army amen hallelujah this may be scattergun but but we'll start somewhere end up somewhere else and you know but we have a cause and i was thinking if this was maybe the last sermon i'd ever stand and i'd deliver to you we have a cause that's worth living for we have a cause that's worth dying for where because it's worth giving our all for hallelujah so we have we have an enemy to fight we must understand that sure he is defeated but he's a slicker you cannot defeat him in your own strength amen you cannot not with your mind not with what you remember not with your affections your conscience imagining imagination reasoning you can't defeat him in your own ability doesn't matter how much self-control you have you cannot defeat him it takes the holy ghost in your life he will defeat him every time and he makes the difference he will make the difference in your job he'll make the difference in your school on the street in your home he makes a difference and we must always remember this that the power of god is greater than the power of the enemy hallelujah greater that is in you that he's in the world we must remember this well i'm going through a real hard point he'll make the difference hallelujah amen brother brown would speak of a man called arnold von winkler let's just let's just put this in here that's the way the devil does it and brother he don't halfway do nothing he pushes everything he's got right into you oh our enemy does not he doesn't believe in no j you know geneva convention how to how to handle prisoners and you know he he has no rules i mean he has no rules he knows he has but a short time he will push everything he can into you and then once he's pushed everything he can he'll keep pushing a little bit more and a little bit more i remember thanks be to god god has got something pushing back that he does that's himself hallelujah that's right amen look at him hallelujah so the devil will push as much as he can he doesn't give you a day off he doesn't take leave he doesn't go on holiday he's a 24 7 devil he has a cause he's committed he's not a part-time devil he's a full-time devil and we cannot defeat a full-time devil being part-time christians amen we cannot be part-time christians what does that mean it's more than just well coming to churching no no a part-time christian is part of time the lord's living in your life by the time you're living yourself that's part time we can't be part-time this word is to be put on flesh every moment of every day hallelujah it's a brother brown with speaker of arnold von winkler and it's amazing when when the first time that he would bring up the story he would he would speak about uh oh here's another one so i don't me and slides you know we're trying to become good friends but and as the devil always does when he thinks he's got the upper hand brother he really pushes it so he had a great big fella there about seven foot or eight foot tall maybe a little more maybe ten feet great big shoulders like a barn big spear and armor this is thing about goliath i mean and he stood out there said now i tell you what now that's what we do i'm the witness over here for the philistines let us have a witness from over there and let the armies not fight but let us come out and fight and if i kill him then you all serve us if he kills me then we'll serve you see how the devil does it when he thinks he's got the upper hand he boasts and brags and carries on and he'll rub himself right in your face amen he will put himself right in front of your face and say you can't do nothing about me here i am but that's not the end of the story we should never put up with the devil you know there's a scripture that you know you know the brotherhood uses about the devil being cast out and you know he you know the devil leaves his his habitation and he walks in dry places he says i'm going to go back to where i'm from you know many times unfortunately people who don't have the holy ghost yo they may be acting normal for a little bit and then the devil just anoints their life and they just go berserk and then they go normal again what's that the devil walks out he goes on a scenic tour and he comes back into what he believes is his house we're not called to have that kind of life we're not called to have that kind of life we're called to have a life where god lives and when the devil comes back there's someone when he tries to open the door there's a strong man standing there saying what are you doing here boy this is my position i purchased this one on calvary this is mine hallelujah amen but he'll push he'll this is how he does it is there not a power in the bride is there not a power in this revealed word to cast out any devil to master every circumstance to overcome everything hallelujah and there's powers right here this morning we're not looking for something to come we've got it hallelujah you know and don't don't don't don't glaze over when i talk about these things the only glaze i ever want to see is on a doughnut or maybe a roast ham that's the only glaze i want to see i don't want to see a glazed look hallelujah you say just just lock right in amen this is the hour of liberty hallelujah we are we are living under a mandate this is the hour of the liberation of the sons and daughters of god not a partial liberation a full liberation i mean this is the hour for it amen the word calls for it and here we are amen we'll get to simon of cyrene at at some point now brother brown would speak of arnold von von winkler and everyone who who knows the story is as there was in switzerland many many years ago when the austrians had had come in to invade the country and the swiss have something about them they like to be independent now this is just a national thing but it's amazing when brother brown would bring the story up he would preach a service called return and jubilee so what he's saying is we need to return to the real pentecost and have a liberation have a jubilee so so this is this is the context that he's bringing the story in and and i thought that was very very interesting why is that interesting because we've gone 50 odd years down the road the books the mighty angels come down with an open book he's given us a title deed but now we must fight for the contents of the document right just like the declaration of independence they they rang the liberty bell they signed that declaration of independence but they had to fight a war and they went through a lot of hardship they had a lot of trouble i mean but they were determined what we put our names to what we put our lives to is will be manifest in this country hallelujah now i'm talking about the united states now but they were determined we're going to have it's not just words on paper this is going to become flesh where they're going to have their own sovereign nation under heaven and if a national just a just a nation can be that way how much more the bride of christ how much were people that haven't just that written an earthly document but they've received a heavenly document amen and the captain of the host is jesus and he's present to and to ensure that we receive the contents of that document well what's in that document divine healing a rapture our families amen salvation the holy ghost liberty in christ walking with the lord all those things are in the document overcoming the natural man that that we received at our first birth i'll say many times we're using a complex as an excuse many times you know it's amazing people build great big temples and shrines to gods but in reality they're nothing compared to what people build in their own hearts of complexes and pains and hurts and they they make these things so very big but really what we need is we need the holy ghost we need him to come and sweep out our temple and take those grottos away and those shrines and those things that we people will build their lives around complexes and hurts and worries i don't want to build my life around those things i want to build my life around the lord jesus christ hallelujah there's great temple complexes in the world but they're nothing compared to how people build things in their lives so we should never use a complex as an excuse or a hurt as an excuse if we could have jesus come and stand here and testify of his earthly journey here he comes jesus of nazareth he stands behind the pulpit he's going to give a testimony my childhood was different the kids didn't like me i want to be in the temple they made fun of me i was misunderstood they called me bad names they said that i wasn't joseph you know you know they said that you know mary slept with a soldier or soldier raped her or whatever and here i am but i knew who i was but but there was a pressure that that they tried to put on me when i was 12 i'd go to the temple and i'd speak to the scribes and pharisees in the high priest i wasn't a normal kind of kid i knew i was different i was tempted on every point my teenage years were very difficult he with me he was a man he was the god man but he was a man my teenage years were very difficult i tried somewhere to kind of fit in but i didn't i just didn't fit in i knew who i was i was friendly to him but i was friendly to no one at the same time i mean friends of all but friends of none i was i was acquainted with grief my life wasn't a happy life now i ask you the question now what's your problem what's your if you could look at the lord and see what he endured he wasn't like this modern film idea that they put of jesus or or the kid's cartoon he's like some hippie jesus that walks around and everything's just lovely the scripture says he was acquainted with grief if you're acquainted with grief you know it real well it's not just a one-off kind of interaction no no you you build a relationship and this was the kind of life he lived and he came to his own his own received him not think about it for a second this is this is the kind of walk that he had i gathered many people to myself i was betrayed by my inner circle who's been betrayed who's been made fun of who's been rejected when i would finally end up on the cross i died of a broken heart but that was the end of my journey i had to carry the sins of the world upon my shoulders not just one man's sins i died a sinner my last cry was my god my god why is that forsaken me this is the spot that i got to in my walk and not only that i went down to hell and preached the souls in prison and we think we had a bad day we think we had a bad decade if he lived that kind of life did it up his walk no amen did it leave him a bitter twisted angry man oh no amen when he would hang on the cross between heavens and earth and say father forgive them they don't know what they do that wasn't just a word that he said out of his mind that was his heart's cry they don't know what they're doing and we must understand they planned the whole thing right you could stand the natural mind they knew what they were doing they had meetings they had they had zoom meetings maybe they sent emails how can we destroy this man they planned it but when he looked down at them he said father forgive them they don't know what they do he wasn't he could have been he wasn't bitter he could have been he walked with god he fulfilled the word for his life there's many parts of the scripture that we would not want to fulfill one of the prophets would walk naked through the streets one would take a harlot marry her one would you know be on his side so many days and so many you know on his other side so many days you know they had to do incredible things but yet they were surrendered to the word of god for their life how about you and i and we open the fridge and there's no food and we think we're having a bad time kind of puts it in perspective that's the kind of testimony he would give sure he'd talk about lazarus being raised sure he'd talk about this wind and the waves and the you know but we always love to talk about the great things but what about the other bits that aren't so glamorous it's all part of it it's not it's not a one-sided streak so brother and would speak about arnold von winkler and the swiss had been invaded by the austrians and they they decided that they were going to make a stand because they wanted liberty they wanted liberty they had a cause some causes are very good some causes are not so good but they had a cause isn't that a good cause i want to live in my free land i don't want some foreign power coming in and taking over i want to live in my free land and so but the austrians had had far greater weapons they had far greater you know armies these people were just farmers but they made up their mind they are not gonna just let this enemy trample over our lives we should have that same kind of attitude towards the devil we're not gonna let him come in here set up shop do what he wants to do no there must be a cry of liberty we have a cause amen so he says right out from behind that table she went in the middle of the floor the hat took off and the cop took off his hat and all the rest of them and we had an old-fashioned prayer meeting there and she was liberated and brought back to christ it's a jubilee friends the jubilee's on it's time for men and women to come back to christ amen here not long ago in switzerland standing up there in the big high uh elk mountains i was thinking of arnold von winkler many of you know the story what a gallant hero he was many years ago in switzerland how that the swiss nation had been invaded by mighty army and the cities were being taken and the gallant blood of the swiss people were sorry and the gallon blood of the swiss people congregated into the mountains into a valley with such little weapons as they could defend themselves with and when they stood there on the field they looked approaching them and when they were approaching this great army they were outnumbered 50 to one and they wasn't soldiers they wasn't trained they didn't know what to do but this army had that was invading was well trained every man was like a brick wall coming right in the devil's well trained he's had six thousand nearly six thousand years however long to train he knows what it's like to take a human life and try and destroy it he knows what it's like to try and take a family and rip it apart he's done it before but there's got to come a time where it stops there's got to come a time where it stops and now is the time where it stops hallelujah amen and when they were standing there with their spares moving up one great man stepped out arnold van von winkler as he stepped out there in the presence they were hopeless everything they could think of was lost it was simply uh they would simply have to go down with their homes be lost their families would be killed the fatherlands would be destroyed there was nothing they could do it was hopeless then arnold von winkler stepped out and said swiss brethren this day i'll give my life to switzerland and the homelands he said what will you do said down in the valley yonder is a lovely little home where my wife and little children are waiting for me to come back but they'll never see me again from this day shall be my life for this day shall i give my life for my country and as he said that they said what will he do he said now everyone that's got weapons follow me and do the best you can fight with what you got i mean do everything you can with what well with what you have got to do with fight with what you got oh i don't have enough faith take that faith and start fighting hallelujah i don't have enough revelation take the revelation you have and start fighting hallelujah and he screamed threw up his weapons he said make way for liberty and he started towards that arm and he went right towards the thickest of the spears and when he got right down to where there was a hundred gleaming spares to catch him as he came he threw up his hand and said make way for liberty and he grabbed big handfuls of those spares and threw them into his chest and each one of those swiss soldiers followed right behind him he broke the ranks of the enemy and they won a victory like there never was one before and today you can mention his name in switzerland and their um eyes with color with tears and their cheeks will flush it to the hero that was one of the greatest heroes to my opinion that's been in the army life but that's just a minor thing just a minor thing one day the sons of adam were standing defeated laws and prophets and everything had failed every approach we had made had totally failed and yonder and glory there was one stepped out called the son of god and the angel said what will you do he says i'll go down and give my life and this day i'll redeem the fallen sons of adam hallelujah and he came to calvary and he went to the thickest of the spears and he went through the valley of the shadow of death caught every dart of the devil pulled into his own bosom and called for the church to take what you've got and do the best you can highly praise god in the day of pentecost a rushing mighty wind fell out of the heavens above and armed every man with a weapon and i say today my brethren that every man whatever you've got let's do the best we can with what we got and fight to the last man because we've got the enemy's lines broke christ defeated satan stripped him of everything he ever had and he's nothing today but a bluff but he tells you you can't have another old-fashioned holy ghost outpouring of the spirit you can have it today because the lines of the enemy is broke and god rules and reigns today hallelujah i'm glad for an old-fashioned holy ghost experience of the living god amen hallelujah oh he doesn't do that today yes he does he doesn't pour himself out today oh yes he does hallelujah amen there's a there's a painting of what he did he took those spears pulled them into himself made a breach in the lines and they won the day that's a minor thing brother branham said great heroics great causes but we have a greater cause than that we have a far greater course than that not just for a national you know a nation to be preserved amen we've got a we got a heavenly calling hallelujah but i'll say this the reason they could rally around arnold von winklers they knew they were swiss right they knew where they were from they knew their land they knew their culture they knew their language they knew where they were from that's why they could rally together i say friends we're not here to contend for a nation we're not here to contend even for this world we're here to contend for the sons and daughters of god amen that they would go free as the prophet told us let's find the last one that we can go home amen hallelujah but the reason they could rally is they knew who they were and we were we can look one another in the eye and we can see the word in flesh we can see a part of heaven literally in a body hallelujah i mean and we speak the same language we speak a heavenly language how do we fight for the same things we're not against one another we're not divided we're united hallelujah amen jude would tell the right to the believers there beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints this is what he's this is the last letter written and then of course there's the book of revelation but this is the last epistles yeah that's written he said you must earnestly not casually not lazily not when you feel like it you know many times i don't feel like walking into this building i'll be honest i'd rather be in i'd rather be asleep but there's something in me i want to i want to show the devil whose side i am on i want to show them devil i'm on the lord's side i'm coming into the house of the lord whether i feel like it or not whether it's convenient or not i'm going to worship god hardly because he gave his whole life for me i mean out of appreciation i'm just going to pour it all out for him hallelujah i'm having a bad day who cares i'm having a bad week don't worry about it i'm having a bad year don't worry about that either amen hallelujah i'd just come and praise god hallelujah because remember we don't worship god because of our situation we're not on hallelujah highway because we're because of our situation we worship him because of who he is and what he has done i mean not because of what we may be going through because of who he is isn't that right that's why we raise our hands that's why we worship god it's because of who he is not because of your circumstances hallelujah that's why david could say that that he prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies hallelujah that sounds like a strange strange place to eat a feast oh no but if you're under the king's banner you can be rejoicing in the mess of the devil amen god actually prepares a table he says satan look at my bride she's gonna feast she's gonna feast in your presence she's going to enjoy she's going to worship she's going to praise god hallelujah the devil thinks it can't be done but we're living it out hallelujah so we're here to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints amen this is our cause is it not we've got a noble cause the noble scores on the earth there's many great causes but this is the cause hallelujah no man can serve two masters for either he will hate one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon you can we can only have one master we can't have two we can't have two we have one i mean so let's have the right one amen what's the pay in listening into the army of the king eternal life hallelujah hallelujah that's good wages and people say well what kind of holiday benefits do i get you have eternity you've got a wedding supper you've got a thousand year old and you'll leave that's pretty good what's the health package buy stripes you healed hallelujah do i get a company vehicle the best one how fast does it go this way i don't know about going this way but i know it goes from one dimension to another that's the best that's the best company vehicle hallelujah and it never needs a rejo i mean it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to go to the shop it doesn't get old there's no newer technology this is the best one hallelujah what kind of security package do i have well you know you have more authority with god than the archangels of heaven you may have been a christian five seconds you've got more authority with god than the archangels in heaven i mean they may be talking to him but when one of the redeemed sons and daughters of god begin to talk to our father which is in heaven he says hold on gabriel hold on wormwood my children are talking hallelujah don't get glazed now donuts or ham okay anyway chocolate if you're wondering with the doughnut i don't know about the ham we can't serve two masters we have the best cause in the world for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when uh he saith all things were put under him it is manifest that he is expected till uh which did sorry it's kind of crop i can't see all the words there it is manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him so the last enemy that will be just defeated is death this is why we're upon the earth you know this is why you're here we're not here to serve through a dark age we're not even here to serve in the early church we're here to serve that there will be a people which are alive and remain amen that will not taste death but will be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and this is why this message has come i mean to transform your body i mean as as melchizedek would go and speak to abraham and those words and that visitation literally changed their bodies i mean to be young people again that they could receive the promise i mean that same melchizedek is in the earth now i mean calling the bride to himself and the words that have been spoken through the mouth of the prophet will change your body hallelujah that's a good cause isn't it amen and we'll do it hallelujah amen but now we must stay true to our cause hey simon simon of cyrene we read in the scripture that he was compelled he was not there in the earliest part of the lord jesus ministry i don't know what he was doing when the thousands were fed in this you know seas were calmed whatever i don't know what he was doing but this was his time the earliest part of the ministry of christ had been fulfilled and he was now taking his last few earthly steps to the cross what has this got to do with you and i we've had seven church ages this is the literally the last few steps that christ will have in a body upon the earth before the rapture is you and i he's the son of man has been walking he's walked through this age oh that was in the prophet's ministry no no it's still now because the son of man is revealed in a body not just in one but in a body so as the son of man walked through the prophet's ministry he's still walking today through a bride upon the earth but now he's come to the last few steps before the translation of the saints and here is simon i don't know where he was in the crowd maybe he maybe his interest just got attracted because there's a lot of a lot of commotion going on in those days maybe he was there when everyone cut down the palm trees and put their garments in the way as the lord jesus rode on the donkey into into jerusalem i don't know but he was attracted maybe he was just interested i wonder what's going on here and and he would see the lord and and and maybe barabbas up there pilate would say who should i release to you and pilate was thinking surely they'll ask the jesus of nazareth then they cry out barabbas give us barabbas and then brabus is freed and then now here comes the lord jesus two thieves are behind them and now here comes the king of glory taking his cross and now in reality he was far more mad than this man he was mad more than any man and brother brown would say um um um would dramatize he'd say as his robe you'd see spots of blood would start to come through his robe and then it'll become one big mass of blood and so as he's carrying the cross now the blood is going on to the cross then he falls under the weight of it and there he stops the roman soldiers picked someone out from the crowd you know i wasn't looking i wasn't looking for jesus i wasn't looking for a rapture i wasn't looking to be part of the bride of christ i wasn't looking but something compelled me something compelled me you must be part of this ministry you must actively pick up the cross and you must help him you say well he doesn't need help but he needs a people to walk through he needs a people to finish his earthly journey in because he has no hands but yours no feet but yours no eyes but yours no mouth but yours no tongue but yours no heart but yours upon the earth are you with me so here he is the roman soldiers call him out pick up this man's cross and he's a man with a crowd of thorns on his head groaning under the weight of that cross bleeding mud more than any man now it's one thing to see that another thing to pick it up one thing to see the word another thing to pick it up one thing to see him manifesting but what about in you what about a new what about the word putting on flesh and you that's two different things it's one thing to see people stand up and give testimony in the spirit to fall on someone else and they rejoice and they get transformed but what about you what about you and i hallelujah so here he is he's told he's compelled you know the last call that went out to the wedding supper compel them get the good get the bad go to the highways the byways the rejected ones go to them compel them and maybe just the spirit of god's compelling today don't just be a spectator get on the field get on the field remember there's great memorials written to great heroes of you know of the world but those things will pass away amen but those things that are done for christ will last hallelujah god's looking for heroes today he's not looking for cows he's looking for heroes well i'm afraid take the weapon you have and go with what you have hallelujah says simon he's told he's got to pick up the cross i pray god just make this rule live real good right now in everyone's life and he picks that up and now he's under the way to the cross and now the blood that was in jesus that was on the cross is now on him and now he's he's he's identified with the ministry of jesus christ he can't put it down and go hide in the crowd imagine if he tried to do that he tries to hide in the crowd maybe he looks like everyone else but there's blood on him there's blood on him he's not clean no more it's actually got a hold of him there's blood on him hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i once the blood falls on you you can't hide and you won't want to hide hallelujah so he picks up the cross and he carries it to golgotha that the earthly ministry of jesus christ our lord would be fulfilled what about today amen is someone willing someone willing say lord i'll pick this word up yes all of its shame all of its glory all of its misunderstandings whatever people say but i don't care i'll pick it up i'll take this revealed word i'll let it i'll let it cover me as the blood of jesus came on simon he was a gentile by the way a gentile help the lord jesus to finish his earthly ministry and here we are today is everyone following what i'm saying god is looking for people to be part of his work oh god will get it done but he needs people on the earth to be available that's right maybe switzerland would have been made free but arnold von winkler i'd step into the breach or someone else would do it but god needs you or someone else will do it no god needs you he needs you and i or someone smarter will do it no no god wants you someone who can speak better no god wants you someone more maybe who can sing better god wants you amen hallelujah well i can't sing i can't preach i can't do nothing i'll tell you in the time of joshua the elders that outlive joshua their presence them just being alive kept israel on the straight and narrow it says after joshua died and the elders then they went into idolatry so there can be people in our midst it's just them living just the life they live they don't preach they don't sing they don't do a lot but just their presence in the church can keep a church in the word that's powerful that's real powerful [Music] hallelujah we don't want to have any excuses there's no excuse i can't speak i can't do this i can't do this i can't do this moses tried to give those in front of the lord and the lord said no no no he just got angry come on i've commissioned you for the job simon was built to carry the cross he was built i don't know what his whole life was before this but he was made for this moment and the same thing with you and i we are made you say well soon it's going to be a rapture absolutely but there has to be there has to be people on the earth that carry this word from this point to that point and up into glory hallelujah he did it i pray we do it too but there are some that maybe gone the negative a little bit there are some that forget their cause samson was a great man he was raised up to defeat the nation that was oppressing israel that was his cause but somehow he found himself in a dungeon with his eyes out grinding meal for the philistines he didn't start off that way he ended up that way and the world delilah loved him and wooed him and vexed his spirit and kept asking him and manipulated him until finally he revealed the source of his strength and that same spirit is in the earth wooing us oh i love you you're so welcome here this is where you fit oh you're so good at this and that and whatever more tries to wore us away and if we're not careful it'll put our eyes out that we cannot see the promises of god for our day it'll literally put our eyes out other world's harmless i can be fine it'll put your eyes out it will blind you and all you'll be doing is going working for the devil going around and around and around you say that's pretty hard that's true that's what happened to him oh but we're in this but but we're living after calvary it's different now is it what happened down through the church ages there's been a cycle of revival and death and that cycle of revival and death brotherhood says has never failed oh but i'm in the message there'll be people in this message that come with great enthusiasm and then they become formal and powerless and cold and they go down to death but there will be a people that come in under the word hallelujah and they know what their cause is they know why they're here and they don't go into that cycle but that cycle is broken in their lives and they just are walking in revival i believe i'm looking at those kind of people amen yes sir but samson he did incredible things what a hero takes up a new jawbone of an ass and kills a thousand men takes the gates of gaza and carries them on his shoulders their big gates takes a line and just literally rips it in two hallelujah the philistines were terrified of that kind of man the his name just being mentioned made made soldiers maybe to wet their pants and run for their lives but now it was different he had allowed delilah to take his strength from him many people said the devil's on my case where did you open a door where did you open a door samson opened a door and he found himself blinded at the mill but all that time all that time his hair was growing back his hair was growing back you may feel like you've been stripped the devil's just got you as a laughing stock but all that all this time you must never remember but you must never forget rather the reason you're upon the earth amen amen it's to defeat death i mean that sin will not have dominion in our lives or our families not lives but we'll walk out of this world victorious this is the cause that we live for we'll come back to that later now and we'll come back to samson now jesus would speak in matthew 24 he says therefore be also ready for such an hour you think uh not when the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant when whom his lord hath made rule over his household to give them meat and due season blesses that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen how do you want the lord to find you doing living for him barely i say to you that he shall make him ruler of all of his goods but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming no one will say that but people's actions say that because they find other things more important than the coming of the lord sure we have families we have children we have jobs we have houses we we have all those things but what's the what's the principal theme of your life what's the main thing that's that's that's motivating you amen it should be the coming of the lord so this so see the lord the laith is coming and there appears to have been a delay right that's because there's more names in the book that must be dipped in the blood amen and beget and he shall and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken well we're not going to become a bunch of alcoholics but there's another there's another spirit you can drink in remember book of revelation it says the world the kings the earth will be made drunk with the wine or the wrath of her fornication so people can become drunk because they say well i've got a long time he'll come he's delaying his coming they lose their focus their cause and they begin to smite their fellow servants how do you smite fellow servants your brother so and so did this sister did this and talk talk about people in a way that will actually de-christianize them that's how you smile it's not physically beating people you can actually smite people by just how you talk about them and eat and drink with the drunkard this world is drunk this world is literally teetering on its feet on the way to the battle of armageddon the whole world is reeling under the impact of the spirit amen of the devil so they begin to eat with the drunken what's happening they actually begin to drink in what they're feeding on the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and for an hour that he is not aware of are there so many things i've got to do i've got a schedule god's got a schedule i want to be in his schedule i want to i want to be you know you get you know work we we're on microsoft teams you know it's not just physically being in meeting rooms anymore you've got to be online and things and you get all these invitations to different seminars and different meetings different things you can go accept or decline or ignore i'm busy i've got other things i've got to do in the day i work for a research organization but what i do is purely commercial work we have 24 hour turnaround time we're busy other people don't have that but you know so other people can go do those things but i'm busy doing what i'm doing now i don't want to be too busy with my schedule when the lord says okay this is now the time [Music] and he shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth we don't want to become drunk with this world just because everyone else is doing it everyone else didn't get in the noah's ark either how'd that work out for them and this whole world is drunk you know the first time trump got inaugurated i i for some reason live streamed part of his inauguration ceremony and there's a bit where they go from some place i think to the white house he gets sworn in and and some i just caught the bit where he's driving his motorcade from one place to another and in this part where he gets out he walks along the parade and i just watched that and i thought this world is drunk this world is crazy oh we're going to do something about it no we've got a different course we've got a different course amen you know but this this this world has gone crazy we don't want to be drunk with this world but remember samson this is where i've been listening in in 1963 you know i'm just listening through this is where i found myself this week so here he was samson the mighty deliverer of israel he was blinded the world blinded him don't let the world blind you i'm not talking about 20 20 20 vision i'm talking about spiritual vision don't let the world put your eyes out here he was but look at him now blinded mocked and just a sport for the enemy all of his powers that he once had for his protection for god's achievement that he had been born in the world to do had been stripped from him by a woman i think that same thing could be applied today that a woman who pretends to be the bride of christ and basing her teaching with a cup of the filthiness filthiness of her abominations and her fornications she has tipped the cup of her fornications into the mouths of god's church that's been raised up to show his signs and wonders as jesus last commandment was to do in mark 16. and now we find that she took uh that she has took god's little faithful group and organized them together just exactly the way she did herself and has got them standing stripped denying the power thereof denying the holy spirit denying the power to speak with thanks knowing the power of the holy spirit to raise the dead to heal the sick that cast out devils and now the philistines is upon thee what are you gonna do now stripped oh what must have went through that man's mind when he found himself in this situation because remember he didn't realize that the holy ghost the spirit of god left him are we all following me and god had raised him up for this purpose and there he stands between those two posts blinded defeated humiliated and he has still the same big bulk that he ever was but his strength was gone the church is everything is stronger in membership than it ever was but where is the word the strength being manifested it's been cut off from you by your power shaving organizations he had failed god and not only had he failed god but he failed his own people he was a total failure now he was a prisoner to the very nation that god raised him up to destroy amen we are here to cast out the devil amen we are here to destroy his why was the lord manifested in the flesh to destroy the works of the devil we're not here to pull down nations this is not what i'm talking about but the he was became the very prisoner of the spirit who was meant to defeat but we're not part of an organization you can be an organization in yourself i've got it worked out i've got everything sorted out to a t but does it live does the message live it must live it's not just under be talked about it's got to be lived i mean there is as i said in the beginning there is power in the holy ghost to meet every need amen i'm going through hard things in my life it'll it'll help you it'll cause you to overcome i heard of a i heard a testimony a very brief one of her of her sister she's just been recently out of school she said before she received the holy ghost she always had trouble didn't know how to fit and felt you know worried about things but then she met god at a camp we had and then she's just happy within herself hallelujah she just continued on through school not troubled not worried why because she had the difference maker she had the holy ghost in our life hallelujah amen one day i might drag her up here to give that testimony hallelujah it really does make a difference amen we must never ever belittle what god can do i'm just working out i'm just i'm just going through some issues let him be the issue worker router let him deal with the issues but sometimes we want to hold it too close to our chest and hold on to these things because we think it's our identity our identity is this message it is the lord jesus christ yes sir but here he was but he began to think he began to think about what he was the thoughts that went through his mind yes and then he was there but he realized he he felt something on his shoulders that he hadn't felt in a very long time he felt some locks that had grown out all the way down this time when he was blinded and i don't know what is going through his mind but maybe you know there was a time when it was just a spear and he would have heard voices oh here's great samson the great champion of israel the judge of israel all these things mockers and scoffers but then there came a time where he felt something come down on his shoulders and he began to remember what his source of strength was that had grown out and he had to be led even though i was a blind man and he put his hands on those two pillars and now here he was in his moment yes hallelujah don't just stand in the temple of the philistines being mocked the devil comes and bombards us in our mind you'll never get there you'll never achieve it it's not yours you'll never save them it'll it does no good and he mocks and he and he just pushes right up in our faces and he challenges us and say you'll never be free of this you've done too much you've gone too deep you've gone too long you'll never do it samson was gone a long time but something grew out and he put his hands on those pillars he said lord i just let me die with my enemy and he didn't know maybe he had tried to push things before but it was just like the same old thing but then when he pushed that he found a power come on him that he felt many years ago maybe and the whole thing came down because he was willing to die with his enemy hallelujah it's the same thing when you are willing to die this is not about some dry eyed confession you've got to pray until you pray through you've got there's a difference between praying and really praying through there's a big difference between saying you have the holy ghost and having the holy ghost amen hallelujah yes and he died with his enemy we'll just jump this that his seat he stood there remembering his errors he remember what what caused it first what caused it first not not exactly his natural eyes put out but it was a spiritual eyes put out that he let delilah woo him into it he forgot the cause that he was upon the earth for we must never forget the cause we're here there's liberty in the camp that should be our hearts desire give me liberty or give me death amen amen hallelujah lot see it's amazing when people they'll take up natural causes they try and dodge the new birth and take up a natural cause i've had someone say to me many years ago they said why can't we just help the widows and feed the orphans and do these things because they're trying to dodge a new birth and many people try and dodge dodge the real cause of christ because remember in order to enlist in this army it takes a death amen god doesn't want your natural talent he doesn't want your strength he wants your life he wants your heart that's what he wants so i've had people come to me and say why can't i just feed the orphans and i'll set up an orphanage in india and i'll do this and you know and they've just tried to dodge the new birth and they're to this day they've still dodged it but they say i know when i really when i really give my life he's really gonna i'm really gonna give it brother abraham said about branham tabernacle he said you become afraid of the new birth and people are afraid of really dying out they want to keep their composure what will this one think of me i don't want to act that kind of way i don't know what how you'll act but you'll know that something's happened remember this is not a baptist way of just getting baptized and now you're a believer now you've got it you've got to meet the giver you've really got to meet him it's good to get baptized but you've really got to meet him hallelujah so lot see lot had a different cause than abraham lot went with abraham and he was blessed he wanted to stay with him but it became trouble became too much so he went down into sodom and we know that he was in the gate because he became high up in the city he became the mayor of the city but his his life could not fix sodom and gomorrah he couldn't take up the natural cause and help the city it was too far gone and his witness actually became totally null and ineffective that even his sons-in-laws would laugh at him say when he said the angels have come to take us out because fire's gonna fall he's left but abraham you say well why are you talking about these things there's a lot of causes in the earth but what cause are we fighting for what cause we fighting for he said well at least he tried what about abraham he just said on the planes of memory he just sat there in his tent but he was waiting for the right one to come he had the right cause because he was waiting for someone to come and change his body hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and i why are you here i'm waiting for a body change hallelujah oh glory to god it says that the conversation the filthy see and with vexed with filthy conversation of the wicked yes sir so he was grieved he was troubled he was vexed and that's why people have risen up let's make america great again and the whole evangelical vote swung in and and because they're looking for the wrong champion they think politics will help them politics won't help them politics will just condemn them but they're looking for the wrong champion amen people go through this through this nation oh we've got vision 2020 and this is the vision of the kingdom for new zealand forget it forget it that's not the vision for this nation the vision for this nation is the bride's going to be lifted out of this nation hallelujah and then there's going to be a renovation and then we're going to come back and live here and the healthiest health care system will be right the education system will be right the roading will be right the transfer will be right the parks will be right i mean they you know their quality will be right everything will be right there amen you say well i'm gonna die straight you gotta call jesus on the scene we're just gonna end up here the disciples had a glorious time they had seen you can read that if you want but you know they had seen jesus do incredible things but now he is in the back of their ship and they are crossing the sea and now here comes the devil this is what the devil does he thinks jesus is asleep now i'm going to strike you know the holy ghost can lay dormant in your life brother brown talks about it you got to wake him up in the ship it's not just a natural boat that's on the scene no no this is the gospel ship he can lay dormant asleep we're going to wake him up and then say here they are they're crossing they just had a revival they're rejoicing they begin to talk about everything he did and the devil says now i've got him look he's asleep he's tired his disciples are with him but they're just talking about what's happened in the past i'm going to draw them right here but he had a cause to cross the sea yes he had a cause amen and then so every ten thousand devils brother and said got into those wounds and waves they swore they would drown them and these men are sea going men they've been raised on that sea maybe from their birth they knew how to handle that boat they maybe built that boat they knew how every condition they could read the water when a gust would come through they knew exactly you know that they could tell what's happening so in their humanity they try and keep the ship afloat this is probably the worst thing they could do why go through all this trouble when you've got the one who made the wind in the sea you've got the master of the wind in your boat why go through all that trouble and try and you know maybe fill the cells a bit peter maybe just turn the order but you know turn into the swell a bit more so we're not going to capsize and you know turn it down you'd go go bow down as you go down the swell and you know robert harder bale a bit more here why do all that when you've got the master of the wind right any and he's right there he knew this was going to happen oh but i've got this sword and i know and yeah i know what i can achieve and what i can do and maybe if we just approach it this way maybe if we just do it this way honey maybe we just tried this and no call the master awake call the master on the scene hallelujah remember god just doesn't live in church amen god just doesn't live in church god lives in our houses god comes down i trust you can say god has literally come down to my house and we've had a prayer meeting with almighty god hallelujah it doesn't matter maybe what the children are doing god comes down hallelujah that's why i love lockdown first lockdown we had we had prayer god came down and and and it wasn't just us feeling good he came down and they all knew he came down hallelujah you got to wake him up wake up the holy ghost in your life stop trying to take control of everything that's the problem with man and then also you say well i don't know how this works we go on youtube and we get it you know or we just google oh this is how we handle this and we go through all the psychology in the world and all this and this and this and this and this we need to wake up the master we need to wake up the master of the ship they were drowning they they were gonna drown and then they and then they came to the end of their natural ability to keep the boat afloat and then one of them remembered yes we have this one master don't you care that we perish and they wake him up and he's like maybe because he's he's sound asleep he knew it was going to happen he wasn't panicking oh what's going to happen peter what's happening what's going on peter oh james oh boy how am i going to do it no no the devil thinks he controls the world but now the true owner of the world is going to speak [Music] remember the devil thought no no this is my win this is my waves adam forfeited it to me this belongs to me but the real owner of the waves came and he just said peace be still and the winds and the waves had to obey him because he was the maker of it now here we are we're living in these 16 elements we'll get to that maybe we live in these bodies who made these bodies who made these bodies the devil comes in with sickness the devil comes in with trouble in our minds who made our spirit who made our spirit wasn't the devil it was god amen i'm so tormented in my mind who made your mind oh my imagination's just just going wild who made the imagination my affections are going you know like girls start you know start thinking they like girls and boys start liking boys all that perversion the devil twists things who made my mind who made my spirit it wasn't the devil who does it belong to god and if he can speak to legion and cast out all those devils out of legion don't you think it casts a devil out of people's lives hallelujah he can speak to the wind and wave say peace be still don't you think he can bring this body back into order what is sickness the the body goes out of order hallelujah like cancer begins to spread those cells go out of order it becomes disorder the wind and the waves that storm on the sea of galilee that was disorder but then the master spoke an order came how the chaos was taken away an order came hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i friends amen we know the master of the wind and more than just a natural storm hallelujah he conquered hell he conquered death he can't get the grave and if i had my keys i'll be jingling and saying he and the devil doesn't have the keys to his own house hillary so now everything of creation must come subject amen to the word of god oh but this is satan's eden who cares that's it doesn't belong to me he's nothing but a squatter hallelujah nothing but a squatter so now we have authority by the voice of god there's god in you got to wake up the master i've i'm sick you so call the master on the scene hell there speak to my storm [Music] speak to the sickness you know everything must obey the voice of god even the devil has to obey him the devil doesn't like it but but he has to obey the voice of god he would come before god about job god says you can come this far but he can't come any further and the devil came and pushed against that he couldn't go past it and he said you can go a bit further now the devil but he can't take his life he came to the very edge yes the devil will push as much as he's given how much do we give him i think too much a pico millimeter is too much whatever the smallest measurement in in the world is it's too much don't give him anything but look back you say i've got trouble but look back hasn't he healed leukemia hasn't he healed cancer hasn't he done everything right hasn't the lord you know every you know what's nice about living in the end of time we can go back through from the beginning to now and say lord you healed this one you conquered the grave you you anointed your champions in their day to overcome their enemies you fulfilled your word here you you went to lazarus's tomb and you said lazarus come forth and if you didn't say the word lazarus it would have been a general resurrection a man four days in the grave writing amen corruption knew its master and he came back to life halia legion was legion became in a sound mind we can look back and say remember the same god the same god there is the same god here he's not different he's the same one amen that's why we can look back though

god's manifested it's god manifested in a word the word is god jesus said it's a seed the seed being planted in the right kind of ground it'll grow exactly what it is and every promise will be produced we forget all about it know that he is in the ship you plant a seed you don't pull it up every day to see if it's growing you leave it there and you water it believing it's going to come forth and you're thanking god for the harvest sometimes it can just be a little bit of a seed of a promise but then go thanking god for it hallelujah don't don't try and cover it with doubt and if it will work just say thank you jesus thank you lord jesus for salvation thank you lord for deliverance thank you lord for a victory thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord that you're the peace of god or possible understanding you're coming to my ship thank you lord for healing thank you lord you'll take care of my trouble we should thank him shouldn't we oh we should be thanking him for what he's

said you're healed hey he says praise the lord i'm healed and his eyes came over you running out of that place healed and well why take the only hope that we really have i would rather believe it and die in faith believing it and then doubt it and die and die and unbelief hallelujah we're gonna water water the promise abraham just gave glory to god and and i'm not gonna do it 365 times 25 because
