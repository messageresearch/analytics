believe sister vanessa has a testimony for us i'm just very happy to be standing here to say that i just want to thank the lord jesus christ i feel very delivered healed and set free i think i've been struggling for a little while just to keep the joy i'll um i'll have some victories and then i'll just go back to being where i was come to the sun to be paid for and after a few months just go back to where i was but on sunday after kosher i really felt set free if i could just say something that might be able to help someone sometimes there's things that happen to you as a child and memories that are not good and you sort of file it away in your memories and i think as you walk in your adult life it hinders you but you don't realize because the door is closed and sometimes for myself there was a stronghold behind those doors but praise god that jesus considers three so i say all that just to say that i am delivered from depression i have that no more it is not a part of me and i also want to say thank you to my pastor for just laboring um with the prayer you know he loves us so much the flock and to labor in prayer and also the messages that are being preached i think after the banquet there was messages every messages that our pastor preached was just so uh deep into my heart just such a specialist work that on sunday it just seems to have come to a climax and yeah and i'm just so thankful uh thank you for everybody who uh prays for me um i just stand to say that i'm completely jesus [Applause] there is [Music] there is power in the name of jesus there is [Music]

amen can you just slap hands for the lord amen [Applause] amen i believe he's the greatest one among us this evening i believe that there's no one above him and having said that all our members all our our our thoughts all our everything should be able to lift up our hands to lift up our hearts and say lord there is none above you the fact that we serve a living god that is above all gods it's a great privilege for us amen i greet you tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ and then once again we are meeting in the presence of god amen thank you so much musicians and we appreciate even the new improvement of our what do you call them uh what we call the worship team thank you worship team god bless you thank you musicians we appreciate let's get ready for them thank you brother josh appreciate the song leading tonight amen songs of zion that are really preparing the atmosphere for the word of god in our hearts amen so it's quite something for the the song leader because uh when we come we come after dinner here at church and then we come after work and then we come having gone through such a lot of things and then the chorus leader is the one who must take us from as we come from outside to bring the songs to prepare the atmosphere so you can you can think by the time the minister come here people are already focused on what they are here for so it's quite that we must really commend our song leaders for doing that especially the ones that are upcoming josh and dave and so we appreciate the lord and um so while we're standing we won't waste much of time let's just read in the book of first corinthians chapter 11. we read in the book of first corinthians chapter 11 and then we will sit down and move to romans chapter 12 amen first corinthians chapter 11 once you are there you can indicate by saying amen let's reverently read the word of god from verse 25 the bible says from verse 25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as oft as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup verse 29. for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eaten and drinketh damnation to himself and this is the last part of the vest that i would like you to focus on to dwell on it not descending the lord's body amen let's just pray together if there's a need in your heart the lord is able to answer that need my prayer tonight is that he can inspire his word and speak to our hearts heavenly father lord jesus christ the creator of the heavens and the earth lord we are taught by the bible we are taught in the word of god father that before the beginning was the word lord we are taught that father god before there was everything there was you lord and we are so privileged tonight to stand in your presence we are privileged tonight to be called sons and daughters of the most high god father let us realize how privileged we are this evening let us realize father god what you have done for us and what you did not do for some and i pray lord as we read your word that you will bless it further that you will bless it to our hearts that lord your word can just transform us can just move us lord from one level to the other that your word tonight father god can speak to each and every individual father i pray tonight lord that you can just just inspire and anoint the speaker and the hearer alike i pray my father my god that brothers and sisters will not focus put their attention on me lord but but on you tonight lord jesus because father you are the one who said where two or three i get that in my name i will be there father and that word we believe i pray that you bless your way to our hearts lord may you bless your children also those brothers and sisters who are watching through the internet channels bless them father let the same inspiration that will flow that is already flowing in the service here in this building flow in that room or that place where our brothers and sisters could be located further may you bless the environment bless their homes bless their laptops that they are using and further replenish even the internet that they are using further i pray dear god that may the word of god tonight have no limitations may you come and speak may you take your sword which is the word and a cut that which is not supposed to be in our hearts lord and build and mold that which we are supposed to hold on and to become that bride of the lord jesus christ that was sin father that you said you will build a church without spot without wrangle i pray my dear god that you will bless your people may your bone may your your weight oh god just cut through the bone and the borrow father god for we know where your weight cuts but of god the holy spirit for the moles and builds and heals oh god i pray that you provide for the needs of these people hands up oh god hearts are up oh god you can see them i pray that you bless each and every one if they seek one among us lord may you touch and heal them completely we think of our brothers and sisters who are not well in body at home lord may you even at this moment my father my king touch them lord we want to hear a testimony like sister vanessa has stood here this evening we want to hear more of the testimonies of young william we want to hear the testimonies of god of our brother cuban we want to hear testimonies of god of our brother david we want to hear testimonies tonight oh god oh lord of anyone among us is not well in body bless them father and heal them lord god and bring them here to the service at your appointed time we commit the service into your hands tonight trusting and believing in the name of our lord jesus christ i pray amen you may enjoy the comfort of your seeds and i've already taken seven minutes so forgive me now uh this evening uh i um just wanna we want to with guests yes jessie lee a happy birthday i believe today he's growing younger and younger so may the lord bless you my brother on this day may he guide and lead you and just pour himself in your life amen it's our prayer and then also i wasn't supposed to be here standing tonight it was i'm actually the spare of the spay if you know what that means brother ahmad was supposed to be preaching here not me and then the pastor was supposed to replace him when he didn't he was not going to make it and then now the pasta didn't make it you realize that i'm down the line and i'm enjoying it down there i'm very content and happy but now i am despair of despair will so i'm coming along those lines tonight and i pray that you'll if when i make a mistake you'll forgive me but i pray that where there's a blessing that you'll grab it with all your heart and i pray that god can just be the speaker not me and and we have read the scripture and i want us to speak about descending the body of the lord descending the lord's body so this scripture we know the scripture and we have read it so many times because we read it when we eat communion so we are not going to eat communion but we are going to have communion tonight so so so i would like us to think about the body of the lord that i would like us to think about descending it you know what is to to discern so before perhaps we go there let's read the book of romans chapter 12. romans chapter 12. you know from corinthians you go back for the for those who are a bit confused you don't go forward you go back you know have you ever seen someone looking for the script in the wrong chapter in a wrong uh section amen let's read romans chapter 12 this is the lately the scripture of my heart i don't know why the lord lays it on my heart so heavily that i can't separate with it for some for some reason amen let's read it starting from this one i beseech you brethren i beseech ye i beseech you therefore brethren by the message of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice your bodies right and we are talking about the body of the lord tonight are we together we're just going to take it slow wherever we stop we stop we'll continue some other time but i want i want us to understand and to follow one another the the line of thought amen that you present your bodies hallelujah a living sacrifice meaning our bodies whether our physical bodies our spiritual bodies that we must present them as a living sacrifice are we together if you are with me just say amen then he says holy holy present yourself living sacrifice one coma holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service you see this just this verse alone is quite intriguing because at the end of that verse it says which is your reasonable meaning meaning this is your your minimum requirement this is my minimum requirement you know when you apply for a job and they say the minimum requirements they need for you to be eligible for a job or an interview they ask you about the minimum requirements not the maximum the minimum because in the minimum going forward will include the maximum but the moment you are below the minimum you cannot be eligible so we must present ourselves our bodies holy acceptable unto god and this is our reasonable service our our you know a reasonable once when you say to someone not fair enough fair enough when someone a brother is telling you something you say you're fair enough you're meaning that that's reasonable enough for you to approve or to accept am i right sister so that is a minimum or a reasonable service for us is to present ourselves as this one says let's continue and be not confirmed you know to be confirmed is to be aligned you know to to to go along to go along when we say ah just just just go along just play along you see that's the thought around that way on verse two you're conforming in other words you are you are participating you are going along you are conforming so what are we not supposed to confirm conform with and be not confirmed be not and be not conformed to this world the world that we're living in when we wake up here every day where we fight our battles every day when we face challenges every day that we must not be conformed to it but be he transformed by the renewing of your mind i love the brothers what they preached on sunday the the youth service i love that service because it spoke to my heart and it actually as we actually talked now think about that same one for both david and and and brother ben for both of them and the one that stuck to my heart the most for me that that's still resonating it's last week wednesday is one who remembers that how many members the agapo and the filio so so think about that think about how this body should function without agapo and feel you yeah and think about the services that were preached on sunday night for me that was stood out was that you know everything should be done with the love on top i've never seen the only time when i saw a brother reading a scripture because they didn't have a meeting they didn't have a discussion first before they came to church the only time it was during our anniversary where a three pastors from miles and miles away three of them read the scripture same scripture and same verse brother ben and brother hannes and i think brother ivan or somebody read a scripture so only the spirit of god do such things it's not your questions that brother ben and brother dave read a scripture and put emphasis on the scripture of love of your brother and your sister that is what makes makes the body to thick if i can use that weight is it a is a cool way to say to tk or to to function properly so let's let's move on there and rather rather be transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is a what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god right i want us to quickly jump to verse but i love all the verses let's go to the stream man this chapter is such i can't explain it let's read these three for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he thought to think that's what brother ben was saying that everything that i have i must think of it as it belongs to you and everything you have is mine too how do you like that meaning let me let me cut it deeper let me cut it deep you belong to me and i belong to you did i cut it more deeper is it too deep no why that's not so we belong to one another and that's the thinking about the body of the lord now i want you to take to to walk with me this journey i belong to you you belong to me so meaning that i am not there without you you are not there without come on brother so if i'm not there without you and you are not there without me that means we are we are a unit we are a body we are we are we are we are not just brothers and sisters we are brothers and sisters but we are a body which means we are something that must be like this are we together now to every man that that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think you know that kind of a spirit must not even be heard among us to think that i am here or i'm somewhere that brother is some way that's evil that's the demon spirit that one once it comes to your mind crack it hit it because and be careful because it realized the spirit like that can come and you are aware of it so it was not going to just come obvious ah it's not going to come over the devil will never come obvious even to eve he didn't come obvious he come in the bible calls it in a subtle way brother mario in a subtle way so that by the time you realize you have already done it that's how he works so we need to be to be renewed that transformed our mind but to think soberly according as god had telled to every man a measure of faith we must understand brothers and sisters that faith that we are talking about god has given it to us we didn't create and generate it to ourselves god created it for us and revealed it to us and we saw him so therefore my brother or my sister i can never say are you of weak faith no we must know that i am given a measure of faith and my brother is given a measure a measure it means as a portion of faith you know when you go get medicine they give you they give you a measure a measure for the medicine it's written there fifteen percent a fifteenth century fifteen mil sorry fifty meals five meals ten meals that you must now for a little child you give them 10 meals that's the measure and for another 50 ml that's the measure so god has given us a measure i don't know if he i don't know i don't i'm not saying he used meals but i'm saying he get the bible says he has given us a measure of faith therefore if you feel and you've got you've got the revelation you are not going to be able to to look at another brother differently amen are we together now this is what vest that i want us to reverse for for as we have many members in the body as we have many members in the world in the body and all members have not the same office in other words we do not have the same functions and think about think about your own body okay we'll get to that let's phrase this this verse quickly we have not the same office so we being men because we are many children of god we are many we many are one we are many but we are one in christ and everyone remember one of another i like i just love this did you catch it every one of us we belong to one how can i explain this and this ear belongs to this head and this mouth belongs to this hand because we are one we we may have different offices different when you when we talk of office don't think of the the deacon office or the pastor no no think about the functions think about the purpose that you are saving your position in the body we'll talk about it we may not finish this same one but we just i wanted to split it in about two or three parts but now for now we'll just lay a foundation because we'll talk later on about our spiritual body we'll talk about our local body as a church as an assembly we are a body and then there is a a a universal body of jesus christ a mystic body of the lord globally another one of your members is sitting right now maybe in a prison in china praying for you another one is sitting maybe in saudi arabia where you cannot walk with the bible for free ah freely he's sitting there praying for new zealand believers another one is sitting here in new zealand praying for a believer in bangladesh why because we are one for another we are one body eh so that verse i want to read it again so we being many are one body in christ and every one member one of another i think that this is clear corinthians first corinthians chapter six i'll read it quickly for you you can look on the board you don't have to page so that we can save time my my sister will put it and reflect it then i'll read it first corinthians six first corinthians 6 if you if you if you got it my sister you you just put it over there amen first corinthians 6 verse 19. and what that's what this is that's that's that's how that's how it starts what knowing not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not your own you are not your own i've just told you to remember you don't belong to yourself amen for ye are born with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which is with our gods they belong to god are we together god is our head and then we are the body so we are not we are not of ourselves we are for him we are for one another we are part of him and we belong to one another and him amen now let's talk about this little weight called discernment let's talk about the word discernment what is to descend to descend ah i i believe that weight is called more meaning than to perceive you know it has got a deeper meaning because to discern in the true meaning of that word you've got to use a certain spirit to be able to detect ah i find in that word wisdom i find anointing of the spirit in that way i find you know there's so many things loaded in that way you know to detect with a sense other than a vision it is more than just a vision to discern it's more than just to say oh i see i understand it's way more than that you are able to descend that is why it's also one of the nine spiritual gift a gift of discernment am i right so to recognize and identify as separate and distinct there's a problem when when a believer cannot separate between the thought of the devil and the thought of of god we must have a descendant a descent a descending spirit to be able to say ah this is the devil not to take it and walk along along the way ah wait a second you see so but with experience by faith and by the grace of god we get to that young people i suffered from that when i was young and i'll explain to you how i struggled with my thoughts just along with my thoughts i find myself talking alone saying not not being sure whether is this god or the devil you know some of you can identify with that and you find that the devil will come in such a way where you cannot pick it up so you need the sp the spirit of god to help you to descend and the wisdom of god in that way there's so many things loaded in that word of discernment hallelujah the quality of being able to grasp and comprehend what is obscure you know something that is obscure it's not straight it's not it's not plain it's obscure it's so if you are able to to identify something that is obscure in the spiritual realm the way you live every day then you will say that you are able to descend the ability to spiritually distinguish between right and wrong spiritually because everything that we do brothers and sisters in our lives if it cannot uh okay let me put it this way i like to take everything to to apply it on the spiritual realm what it means to me i like to do that because everything that we do for a believer the prophet says everything that we do we must be thinking about god in it everything whether our business whether you're going to eat whether you're going to comb your hair sister maggie whether you're going to shower we welcome my dear sister esther whether you are going to another one can ask and say oh brother how can i brush my teeth and apply that spiritually ah you can think about it yeah oh i want to scratch myself how can everything think about the lord huh i want to think how what could this be meaning in my life spiritually if i don't scratch and i'm itching what will happen i like to think like that so think about everything for a believer is so important because you are a very very very important person there are people that are called vips and that those that are called the vvips you know them do you know them you are way more than that i want to announce to you tonight that you are way more than because look look at it this way if jesus christ can live heaven and earth i mean can leave heaven and come here to come and die for you who are you who let me ask you it's not the root way hey just understand what i'm trying to say who do you think you are you who do you think you are that jesus christ must come and die for you for your sins for you to be forgiven who do you think you are are you realizing who you are you are very very important sister kay be vip is an understatement no expression of this world can explain who you are and then we are in the same body another one is a toe a toe what do we call it the toe toe toe toe whatever because the making what do you call it at all another one is actually a small toe i would love to be a small toe another one is just a piece of hair here another one is just a you know there's something inside the body is called the pancreas those who did biology another one is what we call a neuron in a body neuron it's like some some signals that send messages through the body you'll find them everywhere in the body neurons just like veins of the transpose blood and oxygen and food some of some of you are dead imagine if you are transporting you are you are you are the main capillary that transport blood and oxygen blood to the heart and bed imagine if you are dead so in this body of the lord you are extremely important if you are not and you are at all the lord would not have made you you are so important that's the point of the patch that i want you to understand that you you have been born with a great press and a son of the king and a daughter of the king will conduct themselves and behave and handle themselves in the way of the king because you're not just a you're not just a sister no what is so wonderful about this is that we don't go out breaking all we go out doing is to find our brothers and our sisters and bring them amen for them to know who they are you have been born with a great price and that means that you are part of this important body of the lord and have to conduct yourself in the same way it's not a choice it's not whether you like it or you don't like it no you have to am i putting it in a in a democratic way okay the bible says you must be born again it's not about you you may be born again or not no you must be born again it's not whether no no it's my choice it is your choice of course the problem is that if you are going to approach it with the anchor that says it's my choice i cannot i cannot i can take it or i can leave it you see you will simply just be showing that on me i'm not part of that body because tomorrow you can today you can't a real person who is part of that body you're talking about realizes that as paul said i am a prisoner of love divine not just a prisoner a prisoner of jesus christ is not a suffering prisoner is a prisoner of love divine have you never heard of a a a a a a young man saying to a young girl that you've taken me prison have you never heard of such a statement it does not mean that he's a prisoner that he's hitting him every day no it's a prisoner of love how can i explain this mama shall not eh that's that's what we are so we are being imprisoned in this body you can't say no no no me i don't no no okay i want to say that i've got no choice but to love the lord because he chose me i mean he died for me thank you jesus amen now let's we have under we we try to unpack the word discernment and now this this body that we are talking about uh that that must have a discernment are we together it says that we need to look at them uh how does it continue to function how does it continue to be together how how if you think of your body how does your body continue to function huh how does it continue to get strong how does it continue to to proceed with life zero yeah little girl zero yeah you go now today is jesus birthday 13 teenager now you grow up you know you marry how do you continue and you serve the lord how do you continue it's because there are things that you do throughout your journey in life are we together so and that's the life of a believer in this body that we are talking about we are just laying a foundation today now in this body that we are talking about is that we find that there is what you call communion and a communion what we do here and eat the bread and drink the wine and it's just a physical illustration of the true communion it's not the communion don't tell the pastor that i said this what i'm trying to say is that true communion is when you and the lord jesus christ are communing amen is when you are communing with the lord just coming here and eating the bread and drinking the wine that does not make it a communion if you are not communing with the lord that is an outside demonstration or illustration of the job that is happening inside amen so that's why paul wrote to this scripture that don't eat and drink unworthily and wait anywhere inside commune with the lord before you come here and you come here right and you're just doing the outside work are we together now communion is a fellowship with god inside your body i want us to think about the spiritual body our inside body inside body but we use the comparison of the outside body how it works so that we can relate to this body i'll throw in examples of a physical body but the main body that i want us to focus on is this spiritual body our one later on we'll come and talk about our body as a church that's where we are going to stand up the whole service then we'll talk about later on about our body globally but this body of mind spiritually inside that is supposed to it's supposed to be communing fellowshipping with god fellowshipping but now the problem is this if on the outside i am unable to fellowship with brothers and sisters i'm unable to fellowship to intercede for them i'm unable to enter in on behalf of do you think i'll do it with the lord if you or i cannot sacrifice because fellowship is more than just coming together and we say let's bring the rice and the food that is good fellowship i like it but it's more than that when we sit there fellowshipping that by sister jenny it that's the outside fellowship we are supposed to be fellowshipping in spirit talking to one another what has the lord done for you this week my brother hey what did the lord do oh brother you know the lord we are fellowshipping all right take it from me brother you can count on me i'll be praying for you tonight and then you must pray that is the real fellowship when we enter into one another's problem not selectively let me put it no no no no no we cannot choose this this this thing i cannot choose where it wants to scratch in the body and where it can scratch no when he's told by the head office scratch there it's crashes there when he told to to to scratch here it does i'm not gonna choose anything no new my friend is brother edwan and brother isaac i brought the pen is not yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah baby yeah i'll go visit damian no are you part of the body do you descend the body do you understand the body of the lord huh imagine imagine you are saying to your eyes in the morning open you must go to where they say no [Laughter] is that that eyes are not supposed to be on your head because they don't understand the purpose of why they're there if you want to eat and your mouth don't want to open that mouth is supposed to be removed and we bring a new mouth because it's not doing what the body is supposed to do huh if you you requests are being made you don't take them seriously is are you part of the body are you taking the body seriously maybe we must take it further home and say maybe maybe we must start to think as to whether we are taking ourselves seriously ourselves first our us as individuals what we eat what we wear how we walk how we talk how we think fast because maybe it's difficult to do it for someone if you can't do it for yourself let's start day grade one year one ah it's not just remember year one you may say it's year one it's as important as yeti very important but is here one so if we are able to understand how our bodies function to understand how our physical bodies function you cannot just go and eat eggs when they tell you you are allergic to eggs and you react and you just count them and you react of course maybe you've got faith brother is again maybe you've got strong faith but what is going to prove that you have changed that situation of alice is when you eat them and you don't react that's the right way but the moment the doctor tells you hey hey don't eat this because you are acting you swell the whole body and when you eat your body it's got this this this and you just go and do you need to know your body to understand how your body functions and understand how your body is not just the outside how you look no even your moods even your mood how your moods affect you affects others but you see there is a a golden threat that runs through this booth this golden thread is called the holy spirit ah if you go through the whole body you will find out that there is a common fact in the whole body who can tell you the common factors something that you can go anywhere in the body and you find it who can tell me so you are not in a classroom i just want us to participate who can tell me some of the common things i can say blood because you find blood almost 97 percent of of the body isn't it you know the veins you know those veins those thin thin veins the veins you find dna dna everywhere in the body so there are certain things that what runs through our dna as a body you as a body as a believer as a person you need to be able to say lord give me a discernment of myself spiritually to be able to know where you're going where you're coming how you do how your relationship you relate with the lord on a daily basis am i am i am i clear spiritual discernment the prophet says here our churches are broken up men dividing themselves separating themselves not not not seemingly to have the faith splitting hairs over little insignificant doctrines we should come together arm and heart and pray and fast and call until god sends back the holy ghost that we might have spiritual discernment that's the prophet in the book of discernment descending the body of of the lord 1959. we if we can't understand our bodies brothers and sisters we will have a big problem listen to this a woman that dresses herself like that she's going to to be guilty of adultery this is an example i'm not saying our women are not wearing i'm trying to to drive a certain point now at the day of judgement you might be as pure as a lily to your husband or your boyfriend but jesus said whosoever looked upon a woman to last after her had committed adultery with her in his heart already so you might not have done anything wrong actually but when you dress yourself like that you presented yourself to the man he is going to have to answer for committing adultery and you are to blame and the church is permitting that not descending the lord's body i can feel the silence but it's not me that's what the prophet you see so you need to be able to descend not just your spiritual body also your physical body because it resembles your spiritual body that's the prophet right we need to be able to understand how our bodies both spiritually physically functions right now i wonder same message i wonder sometimes if we can descend right from wrong for our own bodies that's the prophecy of our own bodies especially the lord's body see the prophet is saying our bodies are important but the most important one is the lord's body man the lord's body you don't want your brother not to enter heaven because of you do you you would like your brother to enter heaven because of you because why you understand the body of the lord you can be able to descend hallelujah are we together brothers and sisters amen let's let's let's read let's read here same message so what is the body of the lord another one can say it's a group of believers another one can say is the church another one can say is the whole world people of god and they are all still right but let's hear here what the prophet says not only do we in this day are guilty of the same crime that paul was rebuking the corinthian church for but of trying to do something that the lord had commanded without descending the body of the lord and the body of the lord is the believers that's the body of the lord is there believers so when you're sitting next to your brother just know that you are not just sitting next to a person when you are sitting next to your brother or your sister you are not just sitting next to an individual that you happen to know that happened to be your son that happened to be your daughter that happened to be your your son no no you are is the body of the moment we come through that door there's no mama papa his brothers and sisters you are sitting next to a brother and a sister someone who through that person you are going to be able to walk as a body and enter into heaven that's how important we are for one another and to one another now we want to think of jesus and associating what he was what is his body what is the body of christ it is the body of believers that's associated with him in the spirit in that spirit that is why the brother read the scripture and he said we must worship god in truth and in spirit you cannot worship god without the spirit we associate with jesus christ with him in the holy spirit not an idol you know we we can idolize our lord jesus christ we can idolize him and not worship him in truth and in spirit but he's just our god oh we just you see but there's no relation there's no truth and spirit brother ben is it you or david one of you read the scripture in truth and in spirit that's what this this verse is talking about here i mean that's what the prophet is trying to talk about in the message of communion and they are associated together in jesus christ in the spirit and together you must love your brother so much until and this is not a joke that when he gives you a chung gum you must eat it to show that yeah i love my brother huh yeah brother ben choose it and when he's halfway through the sugar finish he pass it on to me because i love my brother if i can't do that my love is questionable said we must love one another so much until we can eat each other's sugar you can't do it just go pray and the lord can help you we are associated with one another that when a man and god talk to each other sons and daughters of god mortal men through the shading of the blood broad remission of sins and this man and this woman boy or girl that he has fellowship with christ is communing with him the body you're talking about that communion is to talk is to talk back it talks back you talk it talks back when we talk to one another we are eating from one another we are eating from one another therefore you do not talk to your brother and then you talk to him but what you are feeding him is not the vitamins you are fitting your brother poison i'm fellowshipping with you i'm supposed to be eating vitamin a vitamin c of the weight i'm supposed to be eating those things when i'm fellowshipping with you one in my mind imagine if all the time i'm eating even wrong thoughts negative ones what am i doing to my body somewhere the prophet said these diseases that we see they are brought by worry by negative thoughts by all sorts of negative attitudes they bring diseases and problems to us to us they make us sick now imagine if i'm talking to brother ben all the time me and him when we talk we say hey that boy david we don't even call him a brother we say that boy imagine why we are feeding one another this is just a a minor example the biggest battle is in here when you are having a fellowship with the lord supposedly and then you are just critical the brother mentioned you on sunday he said you know we must be in a position where we forgive our brother even before they say it i like that before they ask you because forgiveness is not an option you have no option the moment you say lord forgive me because i forgive others have you forgiven them from your heart wholeheartedly because i must forgive wholeheartedly before brother ben or brother david asked me oh brother kira say before he says sorry dad i must forgive him and his heart when the boy repeats it so i must love him beyond that and forgive him and he must forgive me too because i'm also human i can hear before brother mary will say brother brother don't even mention it i love you to the moon and back hallelujah we are closing we're gonna pause and we'll continue some other time but i can promise you next time when we talk it's gonna be honey in the rock i know this is just you know when you're digging honey and then you just start with the starters there and then some of them is not so sweet but just mixing up with the wax there what we're gonna go into the real honey juicy one hey man let's just quickly jump to this part now we come to realize brothers and sisters that the bigger part of how a body functions huh of how a body functions you know it's about eating it's about what you eat it's about what you feed the body clothing i can see clothing only came later on the lord made some clothes just for them to cover you know the fig trees and but eating is the thing that started even from the garden of eating that was the first thing eating so we found that eating has got a significant impact on the body now listen to this you partake in the eating of the body of the lord which is the bread of life huh the lord jesus christ said i am the bread of life now john chapter 6 he says 6 verse 47 very literally i say unto you he that believeth on me had everlasting life i am the bread of life said jesus huh your father that did eat manna in the wilderness and i did physical manner this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man must eat thereof and not die which means if you eat anything else you die together none of you can tell me now that since the morning you never ate how many did not eat since this morning we ate something so eating eating forms part of our life the bigger part of our life is we eat our communication our thoughts our everything we eat that is why the bible said men cannot live by bread alone physically but by every weed that cometh from the mouth of god now you are part of god you and me are part of god that means the word that come from us and to one another ministering and to one another they are life they give life or they can take it away that's how powerful you are so we need to understand the importance of our role in a body you need to understand the importance of our what is going on in here and in here daily and cast out that which is not right for my body and i keep what is of the lord hallelujah i am the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give you which i'll give for the life of the world that is where decided to kill him no wonder that is why i decided to want to kill him when he said i'm if you eat my my my flesh and drink my blood and it was true he was right because he is the bread of life they did not get it amen so you cannot eat food i'm sorry for those that select but you cannot one when mama dishes played for you you can't selectively want to eat it no everything must be finished vegetables meat everything you know if you go to the president's house you dish and you i remember ate curry was it curry and rice system the last time and i realized that i must finish this plate and even though i said no i'm not hungry but you cannot if you you don't finish your food you're actually offending the person who cooked for you also my wife when she dies for you she doesn't want someone who's busy on their phone or doing something no focus on your plate and finish it so if you visit my house and you're gonna finish your food just know that that you're offending my wife so now you must finish your plate because everything that the lord has given for you is for your good and is to build you and then you cannot allow anything to come in there any fly or anything that comes there you show it yes nothing foreign must come in my plate that the lord has given me i must eat only the lord jesus the devil come and fly because he knows the smell he knows the smell of food the devil check when you cook how many flies wants to come there even visitors they can come just i was just saying hello no no they smell the bacon then they thought they can just say hello are you all good the smell of food so when you are given food eat it and finish it vegetables every you little ones amen we cannot finish this i'm going to stop and then uh let's just go one one or two more pages how many has two brothers okay maybe somebody has three pages okay oh my friend that's my bosom friend abe he wants three pages so we'll go for three pages as minister abby have told us and then we can close praise the lord you are you are my minister but today we are doing things not descending any of the word of god we should have a discernment on everything that we do the prophet didn't say something or spiritual things no everything i it ought to be measured by the word of god ah even my closing oh come on yes even how i cut my hair yeah even how i walk everything how i think how i look everything because the bible says everything that you do by weight or by deed do it in the name of jesus christ so can you walk like that in the name of jesus christ like you're going to the tavern you know can you do that no no you don't work like that huh before the lord the bible says we must walk upright before the lord walk upright am i right dave yeah that's true so when we come to the lord even our work changes if i used to walk like that you know when i was a young boy i never used to talk like the way you see me i was working differently so all these young guys they think that we were never young people they think that we never we never did things and try to be clever no we try hard very hard but here i'm standing in front of you now why if one's a son of god always he's gonna find you and don't wait to be found in a painful way come surrendering come surrendering amen i'll read this one pass it now another thing we take food for is to build our body to resist diseases are we together we take food so that we can resist diseases diseases are from the devil are we together meaning that when we take our food spiritually we keep spiritual diseases away we keep the devil away do not come here and not eat the word of god and you think just by coming to church only the diseases of spiritual diseases will go they will never go they will come you will sneeze and have spiritual flu every time why you are not eating your food but physically you are every day every day you make sure you eat three meals naturally it just happens why doesn't it happen in your spiritual natural body if there's such a thing sister know me i don't know our spiritual natural body why doesn't it just happen that we just find ourselves eating four meals a day what happened let's ask the lord to transform our minds amen not to be conformed to the nature and culture of just not reading when you just read five verses you feel who have done something for god no that's how you're supposed to live it's supposed to be your second culture where eating and praying and eating the word is just your nature it's possible it is possible why because even people who don't believe god they can dedicate themselves to do certain things just based on natural ability and they can do that so if it can happen physically it has already happened spiritually so we can do it young people we can do it keep diseases away if you don't take food and let your body get weak then it's subject to diseases diseases will break right into the bloodstream and here you're gone if your blood isn't rich and pure we're well then that would it will disease will go right into your bloodstream so you've got to eat good nourishing food to keep your body stream right that's what the prophet says here we are going to stop and if you'll forgive me because i said to everybody three pages but now i have i think i have to cut it for you my friend because my time is finished so i want to pause here because this someone i want to really take it slowly to understand the functioning of the body i know you do know but we are here to refresh to remind to encourage one another that our bodies are so complicated our bodies we we don't know actually our bodies are so deep deep complicated systems that are going through our bodies that we have we will be very careful even what we eat i know of guys who started to talk funny and they ended up walking like that you know even their bed they hurt themselves but they started just like a joke a cool thing our bodies are so complicated now now imagine if our bodies are so multifaceted and how will the spiritual body of the lord be it's very deep it's very deep so we mean so much to one another we mean so much to the lord we mean so much and he means so much to us so we need to come to the point where we are able to discern the body in other words to be very sensitive to the spirit to be able to know when the spirit talks to you just getting out of the bus or the train the lord starting to talk to you and you are not hearing him you are not picking him ah we need to be sensitive to be able to discern what is going on in us around us he's so sensitive the holy spirit that a little child can just run and he can just fly and stand there he's been disturbed but he's so cool he's so powerful he he doesn't take time to come the moment you say lord forgive me and we surrender ourselves he comes back right straight in the atmosphere in your heart that is he's so timid the prophet says the holy spirit is so timid he's so he's so sensitive i don't know if you have ever seen a very sensitive needle you know a needle so sensitive to to anything it moves yeah maybe if any of you who has ever watched them you know uh in the stock markets the currencies you know when they display on the big board how the currencies move every second mini second you know currency is the the graph is so sensitive the moment they say obama is normal president the dollar goes down everything is so sensitive so our holy spirit is so sensitive and we are part of him so we need to ask the lord to give us that sensitivity of the spirit around how his body is supposed to function but we want to pause here we're going to pause here and then one time when we get another opportunity we thank brother ben for giving us this chance to just to have his wednesday talk and chat i i pray that this have just sort of pricked you know or touched some you know they say under the food there's some there's some points they say there's some points you know when you touch a certain point of your food you know there's some points i pray that some of these have touched some of the points that will go and reflect and come back and hear the hand part later on are we together do you love the lord so it was more very much relaxed of a teaching if you may like to call it but we will come next time and then we will proceed from here when we come next time we are going to be speaking about the importance of what you eat i'm going to ask you what did we say we were going to where were we when we left so please remember my my honest and faithful students and you'll remember hey jono where what is the importance of what we eat daily that's going to be our starting point when we come next time whereas after two months is all right but but we'll recall it hey you know fenu will remember what is the importance of what we eat praise the lord let's just love him brothers and sisters with all what we have let's just appreciate the lord and i trust that over there on youtube plan that you've been blessed as well so we're going to sing a song or two and then we'll close in prayer amen how many love the lord amen amen if you don't say amen i i don't worry much because can i tell you if you don't say amen to the word of god it's okay because this chest will say amen is that hard that's very nice it's very light so learn to say amen to the word of god of course i'm not saying just eat bones and choke yourself no no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying amen the word of god and then he he will bless you praise the lord amen who can give us a wonderful song worshiping song
