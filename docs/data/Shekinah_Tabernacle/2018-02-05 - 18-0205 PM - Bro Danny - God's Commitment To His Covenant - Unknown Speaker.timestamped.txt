[13:21] and you all can be witnesses hey man so
[13:25] we appreciate brother RA and sister
[13:28] pillar and it's a privilege to be able
[13:29] to do your dedication amen
[13:32] tonight and I dedication anniversary
[13:35] everybody look at one another and say
[13:36] lord help brother Danny tonight because
[13:38] I needed it okay I want to tell you
[13:43] something and the reason I wanted to do
[13:44] this this way this evening is because I
[13:46] want to tell you something special
[13:48] because every couple that gets married
[13:51] in Christian marriage is a reflection of
[13:56] the heart of God God has made a
[14:00] commitment to you and when did you begin
[14:04] to love pillow okay let's not go let's
[14:11] see these guys all right when did you
[14:14] know that you loved her that's that's
[14:20] pretty yeah yeah good that's better in
[14:23] married 20 years and begin to love her
[14:24] in 2007 so we des had a problem there I
[14:27] want to tell you something about God
[14:31] you know God never began to love you
[14:38] never
[14:39] he always has right God could not begin
[14:45] to love you he's always loved you
[14:46] because he loved you you can love him
[14:49] now we love him because he first loved
[14:52] us so he never he never began to love
[14:55] you he's always loved you
[14:57] but then he don't force you into a
[15:00] marriage with him he winds you he winds
[15:06] you as a scripture says I will allure
[15:09] her he lured you he won you to himself
[15:13] and then it says in the Book of Psalms I
[15:16] will make
[15:17] them willing in the day of my power so
[15:20] God used his influence on you just like
[15:23] these meetings to influence your mind to
[15:26] influence your heart that you would
[15:28] willingly make a decision to say yes
[15:31] Lord I'm gonna marry you and this is
[15:34] only a reflection of an eternal desire
[15:36] and he can only love her right because
[15:40] God has loved him right and when that
[15:43] eternal love comes into them that's why
[15:46] brother Branham says when when a brother
[15:47] and a sister and when a man and a woman
[15:51] because brother and sister not sound
[15:52] good when it comes to marriage a man
[15:54] when a man and woman love one another he
[15:56] said that's a love that comes from God
[15:58] they said they just stepped out of
[15:59] eternity aiming on into time and they're
[16:02] going to go back to eternity again amen
[16:05] eternal together then how is that not a
[16:08] reflection of God he loved you so much
[16:12] that He gave His only begotten Son that
[16:15] whosoever should believe in Him should
[16:17] not perish but have everlasting life and
[16:20] you know who the whosoever is the
[16:23] whosoever is not everybody because the
[16:25] Bible says that he came to save his
[16:27] children and he knew who whosoever would
[16:30] he knew amen that you would be one in
[16:33] the day of his power just when you felt
[16:35] the power of God move into the building
[16:37] it began to win your heart and influence
[16:39] the way you were thinking you saw him in
[16:42] a different way you didn't see him as a
[16:44] father that was standing off somewhere
[16:46] and didn't didn't care for you and
[16:48] impersonal God that's not our God can
[16:50] you say man it's a god that wanted to
[16:53] win you at the at the heart level he won
[16:57] you at your heart level he's not an
[16:59] impersonal God he's a God that accepts
[17:01] the obligation of taking your care into
[17:04] his his his care he takes that upon
[17:08] himself amen
[17:11] he don't look at you with eyes of flames
[17:13] of fire hey man what did the book of
[17:18] Song of Solomon say that his eyes are
[17:20] like the eyes of a raven and of a dove
[17:22] and so forth and goes on that's not the
[17:24] eyes of a flame of fire looking in on
[17:27] judgment that's the eyes of love and God
[17:29] cannot
[17:30] get you any other way than love and love
[17:33] is not the love that the world thinks of
[17:35] we don't serve a sentimental Jesus this
[17:39] is not a weak love this is a love that
[17:41] trends in sin it transcends the lowest
[17:44] that can go to the lowest and lift them
[17:46] higher than they ever thought they
[17:47] couldn't be lifted when they thought it
[17:50] was over then he lifted them up love
[17:53] lifted me he say men Amen so God Amen
[17:58] this is a this is a this is a boy there
[18:04] I go again yeah it's a reflection it's
[18:09] their anniversary it's a redoing their
[18:11] vows but my mind I shouldn't have ate
[18:14] but God is doing this to you constantly
[18:19] they're reaffirming their love tonight
[18:21] their commitment will to one another God
[18:24] is constantly reconfirming his
[18:27] commitment to you why can't I love him
[18:31] back why can't I love him back what kind
[18:36] of love is that so we love the Lord we
[18:39] want to spend this time now we want to
[18:41] we want to do their vows again if you

[19:13] large with joyful hearts and
[19:18] thankfulness Lord we join ourselves
[19:20] together now with this couple to
[19:23] reaffirm their vows thanking you Lord
[19:25] for 20 years of marriage that is now
[19:29] stronger than it's ever been and I think
[19:32] they can both say Lord that they love
[19:35] one each other now more than they ever
[19:37] have a stronger love a deeper love a
[19:41] deeper commitment and they just want to
[19:42] take this moment

[23:24] our time here with you all it's been a
[23:27] real privilege of mine to be able to
[23:29] come and be with you and I appreciate
[23:32] your attentiveness in the services and I
[23:36] pray that Lord will always bless you for
[23:38] it we could be out doing something else
[23:41] we could be running after the things
[23:44] that we wanted to do as I look upon you
[23:47] I'm seeing young people that already
[23:50] many are at the age where they've went
[23:54] young people have went into the military
[23:57] they're being used to further a
[24:00] country's interests and if they can be
[24:05] taught and they can be trained to act a
[24:08] certain way and then this is no
[24:11] different for us in the sense we also
[24:13] are in a war we also are in a fight
[24:17] amen and God takes young people and he
[24:19] trains them amen he trains them I tell
[24:22] you have an experience with God last
[24:24] night and maybe said there's a question
[24:26] in your mind what's next now what do I
[24:29] do have I done everything I can do
[24:31] maybe you've repented you've done
[24:33] everything that you can well let me tell
[24:35] you God is faithful what happens is
[24:37] you're going to leave here you're going
[24:39] to get away from one another you're
[24:40] going to get away from the fellowship
[24:41] the atmosphere is going to change you're
[24:43] going to go back to life you're going to
[24:44] begin rubbing shoulders again with the
[24:46] world because we can't avoid that and
[24:48] sometimes when you begin to take a ember
[24:51] out of a fire and you begin to move it
[24:53] away from all the other embers what
[24:54] happens to that Ember begins to die down
[24:56] you have to do something to keep the
[24:58] flame burning amen you just don't be a
[25:01] camp-meeting Christian go from camp
[25:03] meeting to camp meeting reaffirming your
[25:05] dedication to the Lord asking God to
[25:07] forgive you living at the altar service
[25:10] after service not sure if
[25:12] God has saved you but I want to tell you
[25:14] amen Jesus Christ for every believer in
[25:17] this room is your personal property he
[25:24] is our example he has not left us
[25:28] without resources he has taught us to
[25:32] believe the word and he's taught us how
[25:35] to speak and I want to I want to read
[25:38] you a scripture out of Romans 15 this is
[25:41] I just love this scripture and I want
[25:43] you to take this home with you and I
[25:47] have 28 minutes and 35 seconds to get
[25:51] this done to the to the desert everybody
[25:55] say desert all right what is it do you
[26:02] but brother Armand do you like desert
[26:08] okay all right
[26:13] this is Romans 15 and 13 says now that
[26:19] god of Hope fill you with all joy and
[26:29] peace in believing can I say that again
[26:36] may the god of Hope fill you with all
[26:43] joy and peace in believing that you may
[26:48] abound in Hope through the power of the
[26:55] Holy Spirit now I want you to think of
[26:58] that for a minute of what the power of
[27:03] the Holy Spirit will do in your life
[27:05] because we look at the power of the Holy
[27:08] Spirit many times as a rabbit's foot
[27:11] it's something that's a lucky charm it's
[27:15] going to keep us from trouble it's a
[27:16] force field where nothing can go wrong I
[27:18] I won't feel temptation again if I
[27:20] really had an experience with God I
[27:22] won't have these things try to come back
[27:24] in well you better believe everything
[27:28] that you first sucked in these meetings
[27:32] Satan is going to test that experience
[27:34] to see if you meant business with God I
[27:40] want to make this statement and if I
[27:42] make it to again tomorrow
[27:44] it's because I want to drive it home
[27:46] brother Branham said in the message of
[27:48] believers contest
[27:49] he said that Satan studies your strategy
[27:55] with the word he's watching you he saw
[28:02] you at the altar he saw you pray and he
[28:04] saw you asking God to fill you fill you
[28:07] with the Holy Ghost
[28:08] how many asked ask God to fill you with
[28:10] the Holy Ghost
[28:13] no never be ashamed of that don't never
[28:16] be ashamed of it before your friends
[28:18] don't never be ashamed of it before
[28:21] in the world don't never be ashamed to
[28:23] give a reason of the hope that lies
[28:25] within you they may mock you they may
[28:27] make fun of you but don't be ashamed of
[28:29] it because deep down on the inside
[28:31] there's something in them wandering and
[28:35] the only way they can protect himself
[28:37] from that question is to mock it because
[28:41] there's a void that is being filled with
[28:44] something else and brother Bentham said
[28:46] and and I would say this tonight is
[28:49] everybody is filled with something
[28:52] nobody can be filled with nothing you're
[28:57] filled with something tonight don't
[28:59] never be ashamed of what God has done
[29:02] for you and don't ever lose hope in it
[29:06] don't feel like that every time Amen you
[29:09] made a mistake or something goes wrong
[29:11] and and the devil traps you in your
[29:13] thoughts that you've got to go back and
[29:14] start all over again this is a
[29:16] commitment like this merit this this
[29:18] commitment that they've made they've
[29:19] made mistakes in their marriage raised
[29:21] their hands if you have have you made
[29:23] mistakes I mean I'm not talking about
[29:25] moral faults or any I'm not I'm not even
[29:27] going down that road but we're human how
[29:29] many humans we have in here I don't see
[29:31] anybody with any any screws a man that's
[29:34] joining their joints together and your
[29:36] clankers your walk you're all human your
[29:39] flesh and blood your grass your
[29:43] something that the wind blows upon and
[29:44] it can be movable Amen so we make
[29:48] mistakes but Amen because we make
[29:50] mistakes don't mean we give up on our
[29:51] commitments did you hear the vowel that
[29:54] was read amen in sickness and in health
[29:57] for better or for worse God would never
[30:00] give us a vow that he wouldn't keep
[30:01] himself God made a vow to you that even
[30:06] when you believe not I will remain
[30:09] faithful when Israel went off like an
[30:13] adulterous woman God said I will win her
[30:16] back
[30:19] the redemptive love of God was shown in
[30:22] Adam when his wife had fallen in
[30:25] adultery all right and she should have
[30:29] been burned amen he was God of the earth
[30:34] he was ruling the earth from heaven
[30:38] because heaven had told him be a son of
[30:41] God on the earth and he was ruling the
[30:44] earth as God would rule the earth and
[30:48] his last act as God was to step out and
[30:54] take his wife back that was his last act
[31:00] as God and then he lost everything but
[31:04] you know why he stepped out for her
[31:07] anybody want to tell me no none of the
[31:10] adults you don't eat all your food
[31:13] you're supposed to anyway yes because he
[31:20] loved her you know what that's all he
[31:23] could say it's the only reason I'm
[31:26] stepping out for her is I love her too
[31:28] much to let her be burnt so brother
[31:30] Branham said he took her quickly to
[31:33] himself in order that she would not be
[31:37] lost and when he took her to himself he
[31:40] became in a fallen condition he knew
[31:43] exactly what he was doing
[31:46] Eve didn't know she was deceived but
[31:49] Adam knew exactly why he did what he did
[31:52] and all they could say is I loved her
[31:54] and here is a man who had creative power
[31:56] in him he could walk on the water he
[31:59] could he named the animals he didn't
[32:01] name them by the way he looked he named
[32:02] him for the essence that was in him he
[32:04] knew their nature he controlled
[32:06] everything around him as perfect control
[32:09] God had placed him there in dominion and
[32:12] then he lost all of it he turned a
[32:15] perfect place into a waste howling
[32:18] desert into a man instead of a Garden of
[32:22] Eden death set in that's what a man's
[32:26] love did amen and God looked at that and
[32:31] said there's a
[32:31] shadow of God in that and he took a lamb
[32:34] and he wrapped the lamb around them and
[32:36] they were covered in lambs blood of lamb
[32:38] skin and blood running down their legs
[32:40] and he took him told him to leave the
[32:41] garden and they go out and he said there
[32:44] is a shadow of what I will do for my
[32:46] children let me tell you God has
[32:47] reaffirmed and reaffirmed his love for
[32:50] you through every generation Calvary
[32:52] showed that God meant business with what
[32:54] he said and I'll never let my word fall
[32:57] to the ground but if I called you and
[32:59] you were in my mind you cannot help
[33:02] begin to feel that love beat in your
[33:04] heart beginning to beat back to God
[33:06] right now and say God I love you I don't
[33:08] understand it well he's just pulling you
[33:10] because he brought you in this hour and
[33:12] the only way you can really recognize
[33:14] God because this ain't a soap opera it's
[33:16] not a love story like the world thinks
[33:18] of I mean this is the love of God how
[33:21] rich and pure and the only thing that
[33:23] could wake you up is the message of the
[33:25] hour the message of the hour is the love
[33:29] of God it was not William branham's idea
[33:31] it wasn't a fable that he put together
[33:33] said I want to write a life story and
[33:35] hope the people enjoy it and their
[33:37] believe I'm a prophet no God I mean let
[33:39] me tell you a man who is the most
[33:41] important person on the face of the
[33:43] earth

[33:54] five well how many believe that you
[33:56] fulfill malachi four and five behold i
[33:58] send you elijah the prophet you are as
[34:04] much a part of that scripture as he is

[34:16] me tell you you're an ester you've been
[34:18] raised for this time you bet you've come
[34:21] for such a time as this God needs young
[34:23] people God needs young people to reflect
[34:26] him in this hour because the other young
[34:28] people don't want to reflect him they
[34:30] want to run after the games and they
[34:31] want to run after the parties and they
[34:33] want to run after their friends and they
[34:34] all want to sell them assimilate
[34:35] together and all be alike and if their
[34:38] friends smoke they want to smoke if
[34:39] their friends drink they want to drink

[37:11] like the anointing is not on you you
[37:15] know amen David did not expect to be
[37:17] anointed that evening when Samuel came
[37:20] to the house in fact David was not even
[37:21] invited he was out in the field with the
[37:24] Sheep he must have lived in New Zealand
[37:26] all right he was out in the field with
[37:28] the Sheep is his father never invited
[37:31] him into the to the meeting with the
[37:33] Prophet he had other sons there that
[37:35] when they said we're looking for a king
[37:37] to anoint he did not think of David
[37:40] David was the last one and you're the
[37:43] last ones amen and everyone Samuel a
[37:47] prophet looked at these boys and said
[37:50] surely this is God's King and God said
[37:55] that's not him for I don't look upon
[37:58] that the person like men do I look upon
[38:01] their heart and he came all the way down
[38:04] to the end and in God had refused all
[38:06] them boys and and and and he said do you
[38:09] have another and he says yes and they
[38:11] called Dave and brought him in and God
[38:12] said this is the Lord's anointed and he
[38:14] anointed him there in the presence of
[38:16] his family and he was anointed and
[38:18] brother Graham said as a type of the
[38:19] Holy Spirit come
[38:20] to him amen and right then he was
[38:24] persistently placed when the Holy Spirit
[38:26] comes to your life you are persistently
[38:28] placed in the kingdom of God and he was
[38:32] persistently placed as king even though
[38:34] another King said on the throne God had
[38:37] persistently placed David as king he had
[38:41] called him he had anointed him and he
[38:43] had placed him and he went out and he
[38:48] fought a giant and that giant was
[38:51] defeated when nobody else could do it
[38:54] this boy stepped up and he didn't go
[38:57] there to kill a giant you understand he
[38:59] was just going about his daily duty of
[39:01] obeying what his father did and let me
[39:02] tell you're going to go home and you may
[39:04] not even be aware there's a giant
[39:06] awaiting for you around the corner but
[39:08] God has equipped you brother BAM said
[39:11] anybody that come he brings his seeds of
[39:13] God in that age they are equipped to
[39:14] meet the challenge of that age a man you
[39:17] are equipped to meet the challenge of
[39:19] this godless sinful Laodicean soft age
[39:23] that the people don't even seem fit to
[39:25] live in technology's gone too fast to
[39:28] keep up with but you are equipped to do
[39:30] it how by the Holy Spirit that is in you
[39:34] equips you to meet the challenge and you
[39:36] don't even know what the challenge is
[39:39] David didn't know that there would be a
[39:42] giant lassies kid what was he carrying
[39:44] he was carrying bread and cheese to his
[39:48] brothers he likes but do you like cheese
[39:49] see you like bread he can be a David
[39:54] yeah we're working you out amen hey man
[39:59] and he's carrying bread and cheese and

[40:05] goner with your school book under your
[40:07] arm yeah you didn't know you're gonna
[40:12] fight a giant that day you weren't even
[40:15] prepared to fight a giant but all it
[40:19] took was a giant's voice to hit the ear
[40:23] of a scene of gods give me a man and who
[40:29] stood up
[40:30] a boy just come out of the New Zealand
[40:34] youth camping
[40:35] he was so fire for God in it that struck
[40:39] that has struck him and said I can't
[40:40] stand to see God mock like that I'm
[40:44] gonna be a witness said Amen he's the
[40:46] same yesterday today and forever
[40:48] God is challenging every one of you God
[40:51] is not here to condemn you many times
[40:53] our idea of God is a wrong idea you
[40:56] understand there's a story in the Bible
[40:58] that that the master a nobleman he gave
[41:01] a talents to three of his servants amen
[41:04] to one he gave more to another he gave a
[41:06] little bit lesson to another he gave one
[41:07] and when he came back after he's gone
[41:09] for a long journey and he came back amen
[41:12] the one that he gave more had produced a
[41:16] double of what he had given him the
[41:18] other I produced more but the third one
[41:21] that took what he'd given him and
[41:22] wrapped it up in a napkin and hid it in
[41:23] the ground and what was his excuse when
[41:26] he asked him why did you not give this
[41:29] at least to the usery
[41:30] so it bring forth something back from it
[41:33] he said is because I knew you were a
[41:36] hard man and many times your idea of God
[41:40] is somebody that's hard and condemning
[41:42] and unjust let me tell you God hates sin
[41:46] but God don't hate sin and just to hate
[41:49] you he doesn't hate you he hates in
[41:52] effect upon your life because you're
[41:55] called to live so much higher than what
[41:58] sin could do to you understand you can
[42:01] have a full ambition in your life and go
[42:03] out and make yourself a successful
[42:05] businessman Esau was a successful
[42:07] businessman but he turned down the
[42:08] birthright I mean you can do all of
[42:11] those things and live far below your
[42:14] god-given privilege you could be you
[42:16] could be what brother Armand is not rich
[42:18] tonight I'm not rich either so I just
[42:22] want to help you most I mean your family
[42:24] amen
[42:25] but that's not amen
[42:28] the goal amen the highest form of life
[42:34] is not a human being
[42:39] the highest form of life is a human
[42:42] being who has a Holy Ghost living inside
[42:46] of them and you with the Holy Spirit
[42:49] living in you will transcend anything
[42:52] you've ever thought you could think or
[42:53] do God in order for you to to live the
[43:01] fullest and the highest may lower your
[43:03] standard of living he may lower your
[43:08] dreams because he's got a goal in mind
[43:11] he's got a target he's hitting it was we
[43:14] talked about last night about amen and
[43:17] children are arrows and a Quivers I mean
[43:19] they're supposed to be aimed by the
[43:20] parents appointed at a target well don't
[43:23] you think God does that with his
[43:24] children he aims you at a target brother
[43:27] Ram said that the bride of this age will
[43:29] will overcome Satan and face-to-face
[43:32] confrontation with the enemy she will
[43:34] prove she is not like that first Eve

[46:26] greatest enemy of faith there is but
[46:29] that's not the hope God is talking about
[46:31] the hope brother branham is talking
[46:33] about is the worldly hope where they
[46:35] just wish it happens this hope he's
[46:37] talking about as expectation expectation
[46:41] is a different thing expectation calls
[46:43] the house of Cornelius to be filled with
[46:45] the Holy Ghost as they heard the word
[46:47] come on so may the god of expectation
[46:51] fill you with all joy and hope in
[46:55] believing through the power of the Holy

[47:17] businessman the best nurse I don't know
[47:19] where you're at in your life cuz again
[47:22] I'm from 8000 miles away I don't know
[47:25] where you're at but life can take a turn
[47:31] that you don't count for it took a turn
[47:36] in David's life here is the king he
[47:39] knows he's anointed he's going in that
[47:41] anointing he's raised a Giants head
[47:44] blood running down his arm and the
[47:46] armies of the Philistines screaming in
[47:48] terror running for their lives and he
[47:51] takes it up to Jerusalem he hears
[47:53] everybody's singing Saul has killed his
[47:55] thousands but david has killed his ten
[47:58] thousands David found on top of the
[48:00] world until Saul was anointed with an
[48:05] evil spirit and begin to chase after
[48:08] David to take his life and now David is
[48:10] caught between Israel and between the
[48:13] Philistines and he's running for his
[48:16] life
[48:16] and one day he comes he comes in two he
[48:21] comes in he don't have a weapon he don't
[48:23] have no food he's on the run and he's
[48:25] still the king he's still anointed but
[48:28] he just don't feel anoint it I've got
[48:32] five more minutes to finish this out he
[48:35] doesn't feel anointed and he's on the
[48:37] run and he comes to the city of Nob and
[48:40] he goes in there and he asks the priests
[48:42] he said we need bread we it
[48:44] and so forth and the priest goes through
[48:46] the qualifications have your men been
[48:47] with women and everything in the last
[48:49] wall and David said that no they they
[48:51] qualified out so they gave him food he
[48:52] knows do you have a weapon he goes all I
[48:56] have is the sword of Goliath now David
[48:59] is on the run he stretched out his
[49:03] nerves are shredded where's the
[49:07] anointing now where's the feeling of of
[49:10] the youth camp now and the priest said
[49:16] all we have is this sword of Goliath
[49:20] behind the ephod there was something
[49:22] hidden nobody else could see it was a
[49:24] sword David said that's a good one you
[49:28] know God lays memories that opportune
[49:32] times in your life to remind you he's
[49:34] faithful and that he still the
[49:36] victorious God and I trust that in your
[49:39] dark hour there come a memory of this
[49:41] time because this hour was your victory
[49:45] victory in Jesus my Savior forever he
[49:49] sought me and he bought me with his
[49:51] redeeming blood he loved me ere I knew
[49:53] him and all my life is due him he
[49:57] plunged me to victory beneath the
[49:59] cleansing flood do you believe he did
[50:01] that for you and he pulled that sword
[50:04] out and there came a memory of David
[50:06] standing upon a giant using his own
[50:08] weapon and cutting his head off
[50:11] you see David didn't have a sword that
[50:13] day but he took the enemy's sword from
[50:15] him you know you've been equipped to
[50:17] take the enemy's sword from him come on
[50:19] because the enemy's been trying to use
[50:21] the word on you all your life you're not
[50:22] worthy you can't make it you can't get
[50:24] the Holy Ghost look at who you are look
[50:26] away your life path has come through
[50:28] look at the misery in your family why
[50:30] would God pay any attention to you I'll
[50:32] tell you why because he loved you and he
[50:35] can never take it back
[50:37] don't matter where that life went God
[50:40] will never leave you and you know even
[50:42] when David had that memory was it a good
[50:44] was it the next day better no it got
[50:47] worse and worse for David in fact at the
[50:49] end of that chapter he's acting like a
[50:51] madman spitting and spinels running down
[50:53] his beard because he's afraid for his
[50:55] life in the palace of the king of
[50:58] Philistia
[51:00] you know what you know all of that he's
[51:05] still the king can you say glory he's
[51:11] still the king amen because God says
[51:16] this is my firstborn you went to you
[51:18] David was the last of his family but God
[51:20] called him my firstborn you know what
[51:23] God said about firstborn children let me
[51:26] just give you a little clue enclosing
[51:27] everybody say closing what did you just

[52:29] you are worthy of his blood worthy of
[52:33] his sacrifice and you know what all
[52:35] those hard turns for David did for him
[52:38] it made him a just King even when David
[52:44] fell in adultery later in his life he
[52:46] didn't have the Holy Ghost it only fall
[52:48] upon him the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet
[52:50] yeah all right but even when he fell
