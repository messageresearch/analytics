[1:03:53] their portion and Lord just may you
[1:03:55] receive all honor glory and praise Lord
[1:03:57] this morning in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[1:03:59] amen god bless your friends you may have
[1:04:02] your seats this morning I want to I want
[1:04:04] to speak if I could if I could if I
[1:04:07] could take a title this morning I'd like
[1:04:08] to take the Apostle Paul's words here
[1:04:11] where he's speaking in first Corinthians
[1:04:12] 15 we read but by the grace of God I am
[1:04:15] what I am now
[1:04:18] grace is the grace of God I believe is a
[1:04:21] very misunderstood thing today and
[1:04:23] people make it all kinds of things yours
[1:04:25] brother Brown would say in the message
[1:04:26] of grace he says and the message of
[1:04:28] grace has been trampled under the feet
[1:04:30] of men until it's become a disgrace some
[1:04:33] of them runs out into eternal security
[1:04:34] some runs out into everything but the
[1:04:37] true message of grace remains the same
[1:04:39] and that and there's where Satan tries
[1:04:41] to knock it out from the church but it's
[1:04:44] the grace of God we're all safe by and
[1:04:46] even as Jude would say in Jude 3 and for
[1:04:49] esa's beloved I give all diligence to
[1:04:52] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:04:54] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:04:56] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[1:04:58] contend for the faith which was once
[1:05:00] delivered unto the Saints for there are
[1:05:03] certain men crept in unawares who were
[1:05:05] before of old ordained to this
[1:05:08] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:05:11] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:05:13] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:05:17] Jesus Christ now though I think I see
[1:05:19] twas the New Living Translation sees it
[1:05:21] like this I say this because some
[1:05:23] ungodly people have wormed their way
[1:05:25] into your churches saying that God's
[1:05:27] marvelous grace allows us to live
[1:05:29] immoral lives the condemnation of such
[1:05:32] people was recorded long ago for they
[1:05:35] have denied our only master and Lord
[1:05:37] Jesus Christ so if Jude could write to
[1:05:41] the church just surely after you know
[1:05:43] the day of Pentecost and he was he was
[1:05:45] exhorting him to earnestly contend for
[1:05:47] the faith because some of krypton
[1:05:49] unawares have turned the grace of God
[1:05:51] into lasciviousness how much more 2,000
[1:05:54] years down the road I mean shall we
[1:05:55] contend for the
[1:05:57] message of grace I mean the Apostle Paul
[1:06:00] when he said but that by by the grace of
[1:06:03] God I am what I am he was declaring that
[1:06:05] the grace of God made him something it
[1:06:08] wasn't just a word he said which you
[1:06:10] know it's the grace of God like some
[1:06:11] eerie fairy thing but he was saying that
[1:06:14] he was a product of God's grace so God's
[1:06:17] grace molded him shaped them changed him
[1:06:19] transformed him from what he was and to
[1:06:22] what he became so we know the you know
[1:06:24] you know the Apostle Paul he was Saul he
[1:06:28] was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he is a
[1:06:30] very religious man he fought against
[1:06:32] what God was doing in his day he you
[1:06:34] know you know he was you know he was
[1:06:36] organizationally minded he he didn't
[1:06:38] know what God was doing he only knew of
[1:06:40] a god of history he only read the
[1:06:42] scrolls and you what God did but he
[1:06:43] didn't know what did God was doing and
[1:06:45] then to that one he was but when God's
[1:06:47] grace came to him had changed him from
[1:06:49] that and to and to the Apostle to the
[1:06:51] Gentiles for the first church age
[1:06:53] messenger it transformed him from what
[1:06:55] he was to what he became so so the grace
[1:06:58] of God actually is a force it's a power
[1:07:00] I mean it's not just a nice word I'm
[1:07:02] saved by the grace of God know if you're
[1:07:04] saved by the grace of God it will
[1:07:06] manifest in your life and in your life
[1:07:08] that you live it won't be you trying to
[1:07:10] do it
[1:07:10] I mean he his Spirit will come into you
[1:07:13] and he will be the Christian in you holy
[1:07:15] it's not us trying to be Christians it's
[1:07:17] him in us being the Christian other
[1:07:19] that's how we really are Christians amen
[1:07:21] so so there's a power there's a force
[1:07:24] amen of the grace of God that transforms
[1:07:27] people and even in the New Testament you
[1:07:30] know if you go look at the UM you know
[1:07:32] you know the meaning of words you know
[1:07:34] the word grace in the New Testament it
[1:07:37] says this word it means a graciousness
[1:07:41] and it means a it means especially the
[1:07:45] divine influence upon the heart and its
[1:07:48] reflection in the life so this is what
[1:07:50] grace means it's a it's the divine
[1:07:52] influence upon the heart and its
[1:07:54] reflection in the life source of force I
[1:07:56] mean it comes into the believer there's
[1:07:59] an influence that comes on the heart of
[1:08:00] the believer and it's reflected in the
[1:08:02] life so and even the word influence if
[1:08:05] you go back to from the old French in
[1:08:08] English in the Latin that it comes from
[1:08:09] and means something to
[1:08:10] flow in so something flows into you
[1:08:13] hallelujah and if something flows them
[1:08:15] is a force behind it pushing it in Pylea
[1:08:18] so now if we have come under a divine
[1:08:20] influence if we have felt the grace of
[1:08:21] God come around our lives God's flown in
[1:08:24] he's pushed himself as a force come in
[1:08:26] and it has being is coming to you holy
[1:08:28] has transformed your life that's the
[1:08:31] grace of God amen you look at you look
[1:08:34] at for example you know when when God
[1:08:36] was creating his creation the apex of
[1:08:40] that creation was man amen
[1:08:44] and then when he formed Adam out of the
[1:08:47] dust of the earth I said that God
[1:08:49] breathed into him and and he became a
[1:08:52] living soul there's a force there's a
[1:08:55] breath went into him amen and then when
[1:09:00] Abraham we know Abraham was called by
[1:09:03] grace brother Bram see that Abraham was
[1:09:06] just an ordinary man but God by election
[1:09:09] Sovereign Grace called Abraham when
[1:09:11] there's many young men in the land that
[1:09:13] day that was probably more capable of
[1:09:15] doing the job as the world would think
[1:09:17] that Abraham was but God knows the heart
[1:09:19] that's it so Abraham was just an
[1:09:22] ordinary man but God called him that's
[1:09:24] what made him special and that's what
[1:09:26] makes the believer special we're just
[1:09:27] like anyone but God called you oh there
[1:09:29] got elected you hallelujah God's
[1:09:31] sovereign grace found you amen
[1:09:33] so Abraham his name was changed and and
[1:09:37] Sarah Sarah I was changed to Sarah and
[1:09:39] Abraham to Abraham and in the Hebrew
[1:09:42] that would the H that goes their name
[1:09:44] that speaks of the breath of God God
[1:09:47] breathed into them I say they came under
[1:09:50] a divine influence I mean grace came
[1:09:52] upon them God breathed in the he
[1:09:54] breathed into Adam became a living soul
[1:09:56] he breathed into Abraham and Sarah
[1:09:58] you're gonna have the promised son it's
[1:10:00] not going to be your own flesh that's
[1:10:02] gonna bring forth this child I'm going
[1:10:04] to cause you to bring forth the child
[1:10:05] hallelujah amen show he breathed into
[1:10:08] them and then now when you come down to
[1:10:10] Jesus before he ascends it says and he
[1:10:12] breathed on his disciples saying receive
[1:10:16] ye the Holy Ghost cease now he's
[1:10:18] breathing into them and we know that
[1:10:20] here ooo they received that breath on
[1:10:22] the day of Pentecost so God was his
[1:10:24] life was going into them they were they
[1:10:26] were receiving the grace of God by his
[1:10:28] life going into them hallelujah amen and
[1:10:31] we know that the Apostle Paul would say
[1:10:33] that we are new creations I mean those
[1:10:35] that have the Holy Ghost are not a
[1:10:37] patched up creation I mean Christianity
[1:10:39] is not Reformation it's not a self-help
[1:10:43] guide to becoming a better person that's
[1:10:45] a transforming power that comes in by
[1:10:48] His Word and changes you from what you
[1:10:50] were to what you should be according to
[1:10:51] his word hallelujah that's real
[1:10:53] Christian anywhere you know what you
[1:10:55] once were you're not that person no more
[1:10:57] and it's not you trying to change
[1:10:59] yourself God comes and changes you God
[1:11:01] transforms you by his word hallelujah by
[1:11:03] his Spirit hallelujah so they came under
[1:11:07] a divine Abraham came under a divine
[1:11:09] influence hallelujah now if we read
[1:11:14] let's go to Roman's 4 shall we we're
[1:11:16] just going to read a bit here I'm glad
[1:11:19] for the grace of God I'm glad for us
[1:11:22] grace hallelujah now romans 4 and onee
[1:11:28] of the apostle paul picks up Abraham's
[1:11:31] life he says what shall we say then that
[1:11:34] Abraham our Father as pertaining to the
[1:11:36] flesh hath found for if Abraham was
[1:11:39] justified by works he hath whereof to
[1:11:41] glory but not before gods if so he's
[1:11:44] saying basically I did it all
[1:11:46] you know if Abraham said I did it all
[1:11:47] you know he he can glory in himself but
[1:11:51] not in God for what saith the scripture
[1:11:55] aver abraham believed God and it was
[1:11:58] counted unto him for righteousness now
[1:12:00] to him that worketh is the reward not
[1:12:02] reckoned of grace but of debt so to him
[1:12:06] that workers do it and their own ability
[1:12:08] that they what they're saying it's not
[1:12:10] the divine influence of God upon my
[1:12:13] heart and it's reflection of life that's
[1:12:14] doing it grace but it's my own ability
[1:12:16] amen so to him that worketh is the
[1:12:19] reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
[1:12:21] and he that receiveth of circumcision of
[1:12:25] the seal of the righteousness of faith
[1:12:26] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:12:29] that he might be the father of all them
[1:12:32] that believed though they be not
[1:12:34] circumcised that righteousness might be
[1:12:36] imputed unto them
[1:12:38] and the father of circumcision now so
[1:12:41] I've dropped from verse four you know
[1:12:42] and they'll just read eleven there in 12
[1:12:45] and the father of circumcision to them
[1:12:47] who are not of circumcision only but who
[1:12:50] also walk in the steps of that faith of
[1:12:53] our father Abraham which he had being
[1:12:56] yet uncircumcised so the Apostle Paul is
[1:12:59] saying that Abraham's life is a pattern
[1:13:01] for the believer right that they that we
[1:13:03] are walking in after we're walking in
[1:13:06] the steps of that faith I mean so so
[1:13:08] Abraham was just like ordinary man but
[1:13:10] then God called him the grace of God
[1:13:12] came down into his life because God had
[1:13:15] a specific purpose for his life
[1:13:17] I mean God just didn't call Abraham for
[1:13:19] the sake of it but God was going to
[1:13:21] through Abraham would bring Isaac then
[1:13:22] Jacob then the patriarchs and ultimately
[1:13:24] Christ would come see he had a purpose
[1:13:26] and calling Abraham and he has a purpose
[1:13:29] in calling you he has a purpose and His
[1:13:31] grace influencing your life and her
[1:13:33] manifesting that grace out of your life
[1:13:34] I mean and that is not just to be a
[1:13:36] religious person now that's the
[1:13:39] manifester word for your day hallelujah
[1:13:41] that this Bible would put on flesh I
[1:13:43] mean it's not just this that's no good
[1:13:45] just having the scripture just here it's
[1:13:47] going to live hallelujah that the word
[1:13:50] must put on flesh that when people see
[1:13:52] you they should see the Bible living
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:55] we are the word manifested are we not
[1:13:58] hallelujah amen for the promise that he
[1:14:01] should be the heir of the world was not
[1:14:03] to Abraham or to a see through the law
[1:14:05] but through the righteousness of faith
[1:14:07] for a fait which are of the lobby is
[1:14:10] faith is void and the promise made of
[1:14:14] none effect because the law worketh
[1:14:16] wrath for we're no laura's there is no
[1:14:19] transgression therefore it is of faith
[1:14:22] that it might be by grace to the end of
[1:14:25] the promise made to be sure to all the
[1:14:27] seed not to that only which is of the
[1:14:30] law but to that also which is of faith
[1:14:32] of Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:14:34] as is written I have made the father of
[1:14:37] many nations before whom he had believed
[1:14:40] even God who quickeneth and calleth
[1:14:43] those things which are not as though
[1:14:46] they were so therefore it is of faith
[1:14:49] that it might be by grace a divine
[1:14:51] influence
[1:14:52] hallelujah amen so Abraham was called he
[1:14:58] followed God amen and God called him God
[1:15:02] changed him God changed Sarah he
[1:15:04] breathed into them his life went unto
[1:15:06] them that they could fulfill what they
[1:15:08] were allotted to do in that day and it's
[1:15:10] the same thing with you and I friends
[1:15:12] without the grace of God not just saying
[1:15:15] you're under grace but at manifesting in
[1:15:17] you without that grace amen we're just
[1:15:20] fighting the air but I'm so glad as I
[1:15:23] read in Zechariah it says when the
[1:15:24] headstone comes down to be shoutings
[1:15:26] grace grace unto it now we know that
[1:15:28] that wasn't just speaking of the natural
[1:15:31] temple being rebuilt there in near myers
[1:15:32] day but there was a prophecy that that
[1:15:35] zerubabbel was a was actually a shadow
[1:15:37] of jesus christ saying that he would
[1:15:39] build he would lay the foundation of the
[1:15:41] church and then he would bring every
[1:15:43] every predestinate believer into that
[1:15:45] church and then the headstone would
[1:15:46] descend upon it and because because it
[1:15:48] says and Peter that we are lively stones
[1:15:50] of living stones built up into the
[1:15:52] temple of God I mean so saying now when
[1:15:55] the headstone comes down there will be
[1:15:57] manifest manifold grace grace grace oh
[1:16:00] yes sir so when the Lord comes and caps
[1:16:02] off your life I mean because we know
[1:16:04] that capstone is Christ
[1:16:05] what can the believer say grace grace
[1:16:07] father it's grace grace that God would
[1:16:10] unite himself with man how it's it's
[1:16:13] God's grace that he would wash us in his
[1:16:15] blood cleanses take away all sin all
[1:16:17] filthiness all perversion and we would
[1:16:19] become the living dwelling place of the
[1:16:21] Living God hallelujah speaking of this
[1:16:24] hour amen that grace is manifested in a
[1:16:26] you know grace is greater Grace's never
[1:16:29] been so greater than this day God's
[1:16:32] divine influence upon people holier to
[1:16:35] live above this world I mean to live in
[1:16:38] this world but not of this world it's
[1:16:40] not our it's not us keeping you you know
[1:16:43] you don't keep yourself in this world
[1:16:45] it's His grace keeps you in this world
[1:16:48] Alleluia amen now the first the first
[1:16:53] time grace is mentioned in the scripture
[1:16:55] it says in Genesis six and eight but
[1:16:57] Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:17:00] hallelujah as it was in the days of Noah
[1:17:03] Schultz shows help me when the son of
[1:17:05] men
[1:17:05] reveal there'll be a people on the earth
[1:17:07] of finding the grace of God hallelujah
[1:17:09] but this word grace is not the same as
[1:17:12] the definition I gave you before but it
[1:17:15] just means graciousness kindness or
[1:17:17] favor it doesn't speak of the divine
[1:17:20] influence upon the heart and it's
[1:17:22] reflection in the life that's because in
[1:17:24] the Old Testament they were just under
[1:17:26] the blood of bulls and goats and we know
[1:17:28] the blood of bulls and goats can never
[1:17:29] change the heart of someone you know if
[1:17:31] we went back into the Old Testament day
[1:17:33] I was a worshipper and I I I had fallen
[1:17:36] and sinned in some way and but God's
[1:17:38] Word said you got to bring a lamb or a
[1:17:40] go to wherever it may be I would bring
[1:17:41] my lamb to the priest because I know
[1:17:43] I've done something wrong the beautiful
[1:17:45] thing is when I bring the lamb it's not
[1:17:48] me that's examined the priest doesn't
[1:17:49] examine the worshiper he he examines the
[1:17:52] lamb that's God's grace hallelujah I
[1:17:54] mean that that you don't sit in the
[1:17:56] interrogation seat I mean but God has to
[1:17:59] examine the lamb and once the lamb has
[1:18:00] been found without blemish then the lamb
[1:18:02] is offered on behalf of the worshiper
[1:18:04] and that worshipper can go away feeling
[1:18:06] justified because God has accepted his
[1:18:09] lamb hallelujah we have a perfect lamb
[1:18:11] our lamb was examined Pilate said I find
[1:18:14] no fault of him wholly and because he
[1:18:16] was accepted we're accepted I meant so
[1:18:19] so God doesn't examine you he examines
[1:18:21] the lamb and if you come according to
[1:18:23] that lamb you'll receive forgiveness of
[1:18:25] sins hallelujah but the thing is though
[1:18:27] I offer my lamb I'm justified now I'm
[1:18:30] back in the Old Testament because that
[1:18:32] was the blood of an animal it can't
[1:18:34] change my nature so the very fallen
[1:18:37] nature I was born with that caused me to
[1:18:38] sit in the first place I'd go away with
[1:18:40] it and that's why there was a continuous
[1:18:43] cycle of giving of offerings giving of
[1:18:45] offering so it never changed the heart
[1:18:47] of the believer though they were sincere
[1:18:49] though they believed it was God's
[1:18:50] requirement it could never change them
[1:18:52] that's why it's just that's just why I'd
[1:18:55] say a kindness or a favor kind of a
[1:18:57] grace and you know it's wonderful it's
[1:19:00] wonderful to be forgiven but it's more
[1:19:03] wonderful when God changes your nature
[1:19:05] that you cannot fall in what you fell in
[1:19:08] hallelujah amen see God changes God
[1:19:12] changes our desires I mean we don't have
[1:19:14] to train ourselves to abstain from
[1:19:16] things God just changed our desires that
[1:19:19] we just don't
[1:19:19] on it I mean I used to be a nice to be a
[1:19:22] homebrew making partying University
[1:19:24] student hallelujah but I'm not that
[1:19:27] anymore hallelujah Amen it so I could
[1:19:30] live in a brewery now and I'd still be
[1:19:32] sober because there's no desire in me
[1:19:34] that once it there's just nothing in me
[1:19:36] I don't have to keep my I don't have to
[1:19:38] hide away in some monastery someplace to
[1:19:40] overcome no God changes your nature by
[1:19:42] His grace amen anything you just
[1:19:43] overcoming hallelujah I'm glad for the
[1:19:48] grace of God amen so so it's kind of
[1:19:51] like a man who who you know someone who
[1:19:53] falls in a great debt and then they
[1:19:56] can't pay it but in someone who's very
[1:19:58] wealthy says I'll pay your debt for you
[1:19:59] and that's like under the Old Testament
[1:20:02] but they but the same nature that caused
[1:20:04] them to fall and debt in the first place
[1:20:05] they still carry it with them I mean but
[1:20:08] what they what that person would need is
[1:20:09] the nature of the wealthy man to come
[1:20:11] into them I mean that they wouldn't fall
[1:20:13] into debt again it's the same thing with
[1:20:14] us in the Lord
[1:20:15] I mean God's grace is going to fall on
[1:20:17] us I mean that he changes our nature
[1:20:19] that we don't go back into what we were
[1:20:21] I mean but we become his word hallelujah
[1:20:24] we become like him
[1:20:26] amen so now that was under the blood of
[1:20:29] bulls and goats who could never lift the
[1:20:32] believer into really the fullness of the
[1:20:34] grace of God amen but I'm glad we don't
[1:20:37] live in that day I'm glad we don't live
[1:20:39] back there
[1:20:40] hallelujah see the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:43] amen when you really when you really lay
[1:20:46] your hands by faith upon he's our lamb
[1:20:48] he's the perfect lamb and when you by
[1:20:51] faith lay your hands upon that land and
[1:20:53] you recognize that his life was for
[1:20:56] you
[1:20:57] amen remember the blood of a natural
[1:20:59] lamb could never the life there and that
[1:21:01] lamb could never change the nature of
[1:21:02] the worshiper because it was the animal
[1:21:04] life but here was the blood of God shed
[1:21:06] upon the earth hallelujah and that life
[1:21:08] I mean that life came out of him at
[1:21:11] Calvary and it was released to the world
[1:21:13] that whosoever would believe in him
[1:21:15] receivers word that same life that was
[1:21:17] in him with coming to you
[1:21:18] amen and change you hallelujah
[1:21:21] so now because the Lambs nature could
[1:21:23] never come into the worship in the Old
[1:21:25] Testament but the nature of our lamb can
[1:21:27] come into the believer amen and that's
[1:21:30] the grace of God hallelujah
[1:21:35] amen his nature comes into you by the
[1:21:38] Holy Ghost just like the Paul would say
[1:21:42] in first Corinthians six and nine he
[1:21:45] says know you not that the right that
[1:21:46] the unrighteousness
[1:21:48] I mean the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:21:49] the kingdom of God be not deceived
[1:21:52] neither fornicators nor idolaters nor
[1:21:54] adulterers neither nor effeminate nor
[1:21:57] abusers of themselves with mankind nor
[1:21:59] thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor
[1:22:01] revilers nor extortioners shall inherit
[1:22:04] the kingdom of God but this is but such
[1:22:06] were some of you I mean but ye are
[1:22:09] washed I mean yes sanctified yea
[1:22:12] justified in the name of Jesus Christ by
[1:22:14] the spirit about God so the Apostle Paul
[1:22:17] is saying you're once like that and you
[1:22:19] could never inherit the kingdom of God
[1:22:20] in that state Amen such as some such
[1:22:24] were some of you but you've been
[1:22:25] sanctified the grace of God has fallen
[1:22:27] upon you
[1:22:28] hallelujah once that way but you're not
[1:22:30] that way no more way because the grace
[1:22:32] of God hallelujah amen divine influence
[1:22:37] of His Holy Spirit fell upon you and
[1:22:39] changed your nature to be - to match his
[1:22:41] nature aim is his in second Corinthians
[1:22:44] five and 21 for he have made him to be
[1:22:47] sin for us who knew no sin that we would
[1:22:50] be might be made the righteousness of
[1:22:52] God in him hallelujah so when the grace
[1:22:55] of God falls upon you I mean you can say
[1:22:57] I'm as righteous as God as righteous I'm
[1:22:59] as sinless he is sinless because of his
[1:23:01] blood I'm as holy as God as holy
[1:23:04] hallelujah amen now but it was
[1:23:09] prophesied in the Old Testament of the
[1:23:11] grace that we have received would come
[1:23:13] to the people let's go to Ezekiel 36
[1:23:18] shall we
[1:23:23] amen is he killed 36 and and we're gonna
[1:23:26] read from verse 24
[1:23:40] he says for I will take you from among
[1:23:43] the heathen and get you out of all
[1:23:45] countries and shall bring you into your
[1:23:47] own land now a land as a as an identity
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] there's an identity I'm identified in
[1:23:56] New Zealand because I'm a New Zealand er
[1:23:58] this is my letters my natural land but
[1:24:00] to the believer
[1:24:01] we have no land on this earth I mean but
[1:24:05] our land is the Word of God our identity
[1:24:07] is in him amen we were born here sure we
[1:24:10] came out of many different nations but
[1:24:12] ultimately I mean our identity is in the
[1:24:14] Lord Jesus Christ so we're being called
[1:24:17] now this is a prophecy of the grace of
[1:24:18] God coming to us but he's saying now
[1:24:21] that we shall be um he shall call us out
[1:24:24] of I'm from among the heathen and get
[1:24:27] you and I'll bring you to your own land
[1:24:29] so I'll take you from from among the
[1:24:31] world and I'll bring you to the Word of
[1:24:34] God I'll bring you to your inheritance
[1:24:35] I'll bring you to your identity I mean
[1:24:38] though your rightful position I'll bring
[1:24:40] you to now you can be living in the same
[1:24:42] house you can be living in the same
[1:24:44] place your forebears lived but when the
[1:24:46] grace of God grips you you may be still
[1:24:49] living in the same house but you've gone
[1:24:50] to a new land because now you're
[1:24:52] identified in the Word of God so I'm not
[1:24:54] talking about changing countries I'm
[1:24:55] talking about changing I mean bring your
[1:24:57] identity being in this world to being in
[1:24:59] the Word of God amen hallelujah and then
[1:25:03] now it says I'll bring into your and
[1:25:06] then then I will sprinkle clean water
[1:25:08] upon you and you shall be clean from all
[1:25:11] your filthiness and from your idols will
[1:25:14] I cleanse you now you know we could read
[1:25:16] in the book of Ephesians where it says
[1:25:18] about we are washed by the water of the
[1:25:20] word hallelujah so he says I'll spray
[1:25:22] I'm gonna wash the world from you I'm
[1:25:25] gonna take your idols from either things
[1:25:27] you held in such high regard I mean you
[1:25:29] can have a lot of idols even in your
[1:25:30] heart you don't have to have them in
[1:25:32] your house they can be in here Amy says
[1:25:35] I'm gonna take I'm gonna wash those from
[1:25:36] you I'm gonna cleanse you hallelujah
[1:25:38] notice this is God
[1:25:40] notice every time we read through this
[1:25:41] is his I will I will I will never cease
[1:25:44] you will says I will it's the grace of
[1:25:46] God divine influence coming upon the
[1:25:49] amen and you had also will I give you
[1:25:51] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:25:54] and I'll take away the stony heart out
[1:25:56] of your flesh and I'll give you a heart
[1:25:58] of flesh amen so I will I will take the
[1:26:00] stony heart out of your flesh here
[1:26:02] you'll even agree the word is true amen
[1:26:05] I'll give you a new heart because you
[1:26:06] can't even get along with yourself I'm
[1:26:08] gonna do a work this is what he's saying
[1:26:10] hallelujah and I will but notice that's
[1:26:13] not the end of it because God can do
[1:26:15] great works in the life but you've got
[1:26:17] to come to a place where God seals you
[1:26:18] into the kingdom I mean so you don't
[1:26:20] just go from Sunday or Wednesday and
[1:26:22] Sunday I mean but God transforms you
[1:26:24] permanently seals you into the kingdom
[1:26:26] that every day you are victorious amen
[1:26:30] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:26:33] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[1:26:37] shall keep my judgments and do them why
[1:26:39] because he said I'm going to put my
[1:26:41] spirit in you amen in my spirit within
[1:26:43] you is going to cause you hallelujah
[1:26:46] amen - - to walk in my statutes you
[1:26:50] shall do my job you shall keep my
[1:26:52] judgments and do them so for the
[1:26:54] indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:56] I mean God said by my spirit and you
[1:26:58] you're gonna keep my word
[1:27:00] you're not going to keep it in your own
[1:27:01] humanity my spirit in you is going to
[1:27:03] keep it hallelujah amen
[1:27:07] what is that a prophecy of the grace
[1:27:09] that has come to us hallelujah I'm glad
[1:27:13] we have beneficiaries of that grace I
[1:27:15] believe we see that grace big manifested
[1:27:17] everyday holily I believe we're not just
[1:27:19] talking about a concept but it's a
[1:27:21] reality I mean the god of grace is a
[1:27:23] reality it's something that happens to
[1:27:24] you or something that changes you
[1:27:26] hallelujah amen now let's go to let's go
[1:27:31] to John and one I mean I mean I mean
[1:27:33] John chapter 1 and we'll read from verse
[1:27:39] 11 I mean aren't you glad for the grace
[1:27:44] of God I mean we should be the most
[1:27:46] happy people in all the world I mean
[1:27:48] that we didn't find God God found you I
[1:27:50] mean in the Garden of Eden God God went
[1:27:53] hunting Adam and Eve Adam where are you
[1:27:54] it wasn't Adam chasing God God was
[1:27:56] chasing Adam I mean he's been chasing
[1:27:58] Adams fallen race all the way down
[1:28:00] through the ages hallelujah
[1:28:02] grace God's grace that found you
[1:28:05] hallelujah amen
[1:28:08] he says he came unto his own and his own
[1:28:10] received him not but as many as received
[1:28:13] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:28:15] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:28:18] his name which were born not of blood
[1:28:20] nor of the will of the flesh nor the
[1:28:23] will of man but of God and the Word was
[1:28:26] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:28:28] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[1:28:31] only begotten of the Father full of
[1:28:32] grace and truth
[1:28:33] John bear witness unto Him and cried
[1:28:35] saying this is this was he of whom I
[1:28:38] speak that he cometh after me is
[1:28:40] preferred before me for he was before me
[1:28:43] and others fullness have we all received
[1:28:46] and grace for grace for the law was
[1:28:49] given by Moses but grace and truth came
[1:28:51] by Jesus Christ hallelujah so the law we
[1:28:56] know just put us in jail but grace got
[1:28:58] us out of jail wholly hang and and the
[1:29:00] grace of God changes our nature that we
[1:29:02] can't get back in jail no more
[1:29:04] hallelujah so when but I want you to
[1:29:08] notice if we if we just turned to
[1:29:10] Matthew 5 and you know I trust you don't
[1:29:12] mind the reading but here was here was
[1:29:14] the Lord we know that Jesus you know he
[1:29:18] was God Jesus Christ was Jehovah of the
[1:29:23] Old Testament Jesus Christ our than you
[1:29:24] so when God came down because his in
[1:29:27] Hebrews 11 that Moses followed Christ
[1:29:29] out of Egypt hallelujah and he was the
[1:29:32] messenger of the Covenant that came
[1:29:33] suddenly to his temple according to
[1:29:35] Malachi 3 and so now here so G so God
[1:29:38] came down to Mount Sinai and he gave the
[1:29:40] law but now in Matthew 5 he magnifies
[1:29:44] the law amen
[1:29:47] now I didn't expect a hallelujah but you
[1:29:51] know but I want you to show you know I
[1:29:53] want to show you God's grace is greater
[1:29:55] than the law
[1:29:56] it's always greater hallelujah so if we
[1:30:00] go to Matthew 5 and 17 he says think not
[1:30:03] I have come to destroy the law or the
[1:30:05] prophets I I am not come to destroy but
[1:30:08] to fulfil for verily I say unto you till
[1:30:11] heaven and earth pass one jot or one
[1:30:13] tittle shall no wise pass from the law
[1:30:16] till all be fulfilled ye have heard that
[1:30:19] it was said by the eminent of old time
[1:30:22] thou shalt not kill and whose ever shall
[1:30:24] kill shall be in the danger of the
[1:30:26] judgment but I saying to you that
[1:30:28] whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:30:30] without a cause shall be in danger of
[1:30:32] the judgment and whosoever shall say to
[1:30:34] us brother raca shall be in danger of
[1:30:36] the council but whosoever shall say thou
[1:30:38] fool shall be in danger of hellfire
[1:30:42] now we just drop down to verse 27 just
[1:30:45] to save time ye have heard that it was
[1:30:47] said by them of old time thou shalt not
[1:30:50] commit adultery but I say unto you that
[1:30:52] whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
[1:30:54] after her hath committed adultery with
[1:30:56] her in his heart already in his heart so
[1:30:59] he magnified the law hallelujah Bick why
[1:31:03] because he was the fullness of grace and
[1:31:05] truth and he was telling those people
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:10] without my grace you're condemned
[1:31:12] doesn't matter how religious you are
[1:31:14] don't matter how good person you are
[1:31:15] without the grace of God coming you're
[1:31:17] done they meant so he magnified the
[1:31:21] Lord's because he was the fullness of
[1:31:22] grace and truth
[1:31:23] so the group grace of God is always
[1:31:25] greater than what the law can be Alou
[1:31:29] you know the Apostle so he magnified the
[1:31:34] law and it's because the god of grace
[1:31:36] was released upon the people now when
[1:31:41] you read through the epistles they
[1:31:43] always speak of may the grace of God be
[1:31:45] upon the people and even even even in in
[1:31:49] 2nd Peter verse 2 of chapter 1 Peter
[1:31:54] says grace and peace be multiplied unto
[1:31:56] you through the knowledge of God and of
[1:31:58] our Lord and of Jesus our Lord so he's
[1:32:00] saying that so so he's he's desiring
[1:32:03] that the grace of God would be
[1:32:05] multiplied to them so it would get
[1:32:07] greater amen and and I'm so glad that it
[1:32:13] has been multiplied anybody see it's
[1:32:16] been multiplied through the knowledge of
[1:32:18] God so when God opens his word to you it
[1:32:21] should increase the amount of grace of
[1:32:22] of himself in your life I mean when he
[1:32:26] reveals himself when when he drops
[1:32:27] revelation into your heart of his word
[1:32:29] it should create a greater divine
[1:32:31] influence in your life hallelujah amen
[1:32:35] as you mature and grow in the Word of
[1:32:38] God what happens there's a greater
[1:32:39] influence as you see God sent you know
[1:32:42] continuing to sanctify you and change
[1:32:44] you and you overcome things what's
[1:32:46] happening that the his divine influence
[1:32:48] is becoming greater hallelujah now God's
[1:32:52] grace coming to us does not is not based
[1:32:56] on our present condition they meant he
[1:33:01] is the fountain of grace when he came to
[1:33:04] Lazarus Lazarus was dead for days he was
[1:33:09] in a bad state of being amen he was
[1:33:12] called he was you know they asked him to
[1:33:14] come Lazarus is sick but you know Jesus
[1:33:16] went another way and we know that Jesus
[1:33:18] is never late but but Lazarus coming out
[1:33:21] of the grave was completely outside his
[1:33:24] own ability right he couldn't resurrect
[1:33:26] himself there his body was in the grave
[1:33:29] for days the nose had fallen on his
[1:33:30] danger right away there was a state
[1:33:33] hallelujah but then now here comes the
[1:33:35] fountain of grace came down by the tomb
[1:33:38] Amen in their Mary and Martha said Lord
[1:33:40] if you've just been here amen
[1:33:42] our brother would not have died and then
[1:33:44] and then Jesus asked him you know do you
[1:33:46] believe he can raise again and they say
[1:33:48] yay Lord he will raise in the last day
[1:33:51] you know and many people put the promise
[1:33:53] of God off in the future but then he
[1:33:55] said no I am the resurrection the life
[1:33:57] so he's saying no it's not in the future
[1:33:59] I the resurrection and the life was
[1:34:01] present and God always wants us to bring
[1:34:04] the promise into the prison of his word
[1:34:06] it's got in the past it's now holy if we
[1:34:09] believe we're two-three gathered in my
[1:34:11] name he's in the myths then he is
[1:34:12] present I mean when the Word says that
[1:34:14] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:34:17] and forever
[1:34:18] that means everything he was he will
[1:34:19] been everything is right now he will be
[1:34:21] in the future I mean he is the present
[1:34:23] God I mean so so so Jesus was trying to
[1:34:26] bring Mary Martha no no no not in the
[1:34:28] future now so here comes the grace of
[1:34:30] God here was here was Lazarus in the
[1:34:33] tomb rotting away hallelujah because it
[1:34:37] was totally outside his ability to race
[1:34:39] now it's the same thing with us
[1:34:41] the scripture says in
[1:34:43] Asians that you have quickened who was
[1:34:46] dead in trespasses and sins I mean so
[1:34:48] once upon a time we were literally
[1:34:50] though alive in these bodies dead in
[1:34:53] trespasses and sins amen that's how we
[1:34:56] were we could be religious we could
[1:34:57] believe we could be Christians remember
[1:34:59] until that quickening life comes into
[1:35:01] you and when we're dead in trespasses
[1:35:03] and sins and it's his Lazarus in this
[1:35:06] state you could say rotting away but in
[1:35:08] the resurrection the life comes to him
[1:35:10] it says where have you laid him why
[1:35:12] grace is going to come a divine
[1:35:15] influence is going to be breathed
[1:35:17] hallelujah so so he says now roll away
[1:35:19] the stone and he cries out Lazarus come
[1:35:24] forth and head brother Bram said if he
[1:35:27] didn't say Lazarus by name there would
[1:35:28] have been a general resurrection
[1:35:30] hallelujah so so somebody who is dead in
[1:35:32] trespasses as they were dead they
[1:35:34] couldn't they're God's grace they
[1:35:36] couldn't ask you it was God's ability
[1:35:38] that raised him
[1:35:39] he spoke him Lazarus come forth and
[1:35:42] someone who was dead for days came into
[1:35:44] their body hallelujah
[1:35:46] the body wasn't rot no more and he
[1:35:48] stepped out of the tomb hallelujah way
[1:35:50] God's grace came his way
[1:35:52] amen and we were once in a tomb you know
[1:35:55] the devil the devil doesn't mind if we
[1:35:57] come to church the devil doesn't even
[1:36:00] mind if we read the Bible the devil
[1:36:02] doesn't even mind if we really pray but
[1:36:04] when the life of God comes into you I
[1:36:06] mean that's the thing the devil hates
[1:36:08] palea there was no persecution of the
[1:36:11] Church of the book of Acts when the Holy
[1:36:12] Ghost came down I mean but when Peter
[1:36:14] James it was a Peter and John we're
[1:36:16] going by the gate beautiful and there
[1:36:18] was that crippled man and they said
[1:36:20] silver and gold have my number such as I
[1:36:22] have gone to thee and they lifted him up
[1:36:23] and that crippled places will heal they
[1:36:26] left and jumped and praise the Lord
[1:36:27] that's when persecution began to come
[1:36:30] because the life of God was being
[1:36:32] manifested through our body probably the
[1:36:35] divine influence is coming but now it's
[1:36:36] being reflected hallelujah and that's
[1:36:39] when the persecution came so the devil
[1:36:41] doesn't mind if we just sit in church
[1:36:43] the devil doesn't mind if we just
[1:36:45] religious but it's when God's Word
[1:36:47] becomes manifested in our lives that's
[1:36:49] when the devil says now I've got trouble
[1:36:51] I've got to do something about these
[1:36:52] people I mean so the devil let you sit
[1:36:55] in a tomb of religion
[1:36:57] he'll set you loose in the tomb of
[1:36:59] culture amen
[1:37:01] he'll let you memorize this Bible but
[1:37:04] it's when the life of the wood comes
[1:37:06] into you that's when that's when the
[1:37:09] devil starts fighting hallelujah amen
[1:37:15] we need friends how God's alive I don't
[1:37:20] know about you but I'm a recipient of
[1:37:21] His grace Holly I was once in a tomb of
[1:37:24] this world and I didn't know how to get
[1:37:26] out I was wrapped up and all kinds of
[1:37:29] unbelief and and and pleasures of the
[1:37:31] world I was stuck in a tomb but one day
[1:37:34] I heard a voice one day I heard a
[1:37:36] supernatural voice I mean it wasn't a
[1:37:39] preacher's voice it wasn't the Oh it was
[1:37:41] God's voice I mean with God stepped out
[1:37:43] of history Holly it wasn't a God of our
[1:37:45] 2,000 years ago we did this and he's
[1:37:47] going to do something in the future no
[1:37:49] he stepped out of history to me
[1:37:51] hallelujah peace and he could be my name
[1:37:55] what happened God's grace came down
[1:37:57] Hollywood thing is you've gotta you're
[1:37:59] gonna receive it I mean you can't just
[1:38:01] say well you know you've got to give
[1:38:03] yourself to it hallelujah because when
[1:38:06] you give yourself to it then he can work
[1:38:08] on you hallelujah he says and you had he
[1:38:13] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:38:15] and sins
[1:38:16] where an entire space you walked
[1:38:18] according to the course of this world
[1:38:19] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:38:22] the year the spirit that now worketh in
[1:38:24] the children of disobedience this is a
[1:38:26] Ephesians to I trust when I'm reading
[1:38:29] this you say he's he's he's reading my
[1:38:30] testimony hallelujah
[1:38:33] among whom also we all had conversation
[1:38:36] in times past in the lusts of our flesh
[1:38:38] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:38:40] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:38:42] children of Wrath even as others but God
[1:38:45] who's Richard mercy for his great lover
[1:38:48] and he loved us even when we were dead
[1:38:51] in sins hath he quickened us together
[1:38:53] with Christ he says by grace ye are
[1:38:55] saved and hath raised us up together and
[1:38:58] made us sit in heavenly places in Christ
[1:39:00] Jesus that in the ages had me to come he
[1:39:03] might show the exceeding riches of His
[1:39:05] grace and his kindness towards us
[1:39:07] through Christ Jesus for by grace yes
[1:39:11] through faith that is not as yourselves
[1:39:13] it's a gift of God not of works lest any
[1:39:16] man should boast for we are his
[1:39:17] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:39:20] good works which God hath before
[1:39:22] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:39:25] hallelujah see same by grace by divine
[1:39:28] influence ye are saved I mean through
[1:39:32] faith
[1:39:32] so it's God's divine influence I trust
[1:39:34] you know you really think about it has
[1:39:36] God's grace really fallen upon you or
[1:39:39] are you just going with the crowd I mean
[1:39:42] are you just going with the crowd or as
[1:39:43] God got ahold of you himself I mean
[1:39:46] where if you didn't have a church you
[1:39:47] didn't have a Bible you didn't have
[1:39:48] known to fellowship with you still would
[1:39:50] be a believer I mean you'd be like
[1:39:52] Daniel
[1:39:53] hallelujah who didn't have a church the
[1:39:54] girder didn't have fellowship but yet
[1:39:56] and Babylon he was stood he didn't fear
[1:39:59] the Kings commandment hallelujah he
[1:40:01] didn't bend what what the world was
[1:40:03] doing he says now I'm gonna worship my
[1:40:04] God hallelujah
[1:40:06] do you have that kind of grace in your
[1:40:09] life where if mummy or daddy said they
[1:40:11] don't no longer believe you'd say I
[1:40:13] still believe because he's become real
[1:40:15] to me hallelujah has that has that grace
[1:40:20] come to you and I and I'm just going to
[1:40:23] finish with that question
[1:40:24] because if it if it hasn't it's
[1:40:26] available it's available but you've got
[1:40:30] to call upon him I mean we don't just
[1:40:32] become Christians because mummy and
[1:40:33] daddy are Christians you've got to meet
[1:40:35] him yourself
[1:40:36] you've got to have your own personal
[1:40:37] meeting with Jesus Christ you've got to
[1:40:40] meet him and this word has become alive
