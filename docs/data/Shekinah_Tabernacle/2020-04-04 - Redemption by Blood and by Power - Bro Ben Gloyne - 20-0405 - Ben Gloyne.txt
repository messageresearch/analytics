Scofield's notes regarding regarding this and and he would say that Redemption this is so so this is just his notes and I thought he summarizes through well this is that the exodus of the book of Exodus is a book of redemption and that Redemption is holy of God that Redemption comes through a person so an exodus it's through Moses and the New Testament it's through our Lord Jesus Christ and redemption comes by blood and by power redemption is by blood and redemption is by power now we know that we're living in perilous times you know the Jesus was asked by his disciples you know when would the end of the world be and he would he would begin to answer them in Matthew 24 he says take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars that you be not troubled all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and we have famines and there shall be pestilences and we have pestilences earthquakes and diverse places and we have all those things and Jesus would say and these are the beginning of Sorrows and in and then when Jesus was speaking of are the same things in Luke I'll just take one scripture from Luke but but Jesus said now the answer to all this is and when you see these things come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draws nigh so Lord Jesus himself said that there would be pestilences in these times so we should not lead we should not be surprised that these viruses are you know you know you know they spread through the earth and and we must recognize that even as a believer we are not immune from such things you know brother Brown would would would be alive when there was the pandemic of 1957 to 1958 it was called the other pandemic of the h2 into virus in it and and this is just from just looking at history and it says it was first reported in Singapore in 1957 Hong Kong and April 1957 and in coastal cities in the United States in the summer of 1957 the estimated number of deaths was 1.1 million worldwide and a hundred and sixteen thousand in the United States so so there have been pandemics before and there may be pandemics again but this is just a sign of the end they would be pestilence there be earthquakes in diverse places there be famine to be wars and rumors of wars they see see see your hearts be not troubled don't be troubled in these times yeah even even brother Bram would say when when he was speaking about this I'm about this flu he says here in Susan 1957 and the 11th of December and says we would see Jesus you say now and be here with my good friend brother Hutchins and brother Joseph beau saying and this was supposed to be my vacation this fall I started a vacation and I like to hunt real well so I went out wished to go hunting the party I went with including myself all broke down here with this Asian flu now that's the pandemic I was just speaking about we all came down we all broke down here with this Asian flu we didn't even take our guns out of the cases and come back home so even these even these viruses you're even the Prophet got it so what what I'm saying is that these things are Pierson's they'll come through the you know in the end time but our heart shouldn't be troubled because they're upon the earth and but I want to say just because people get it doesn't mean they don't have the Holy Ghost you know some people want to make this is a supernatural plague and and and I guess in a way it is but it's just the pestilence is a sign of the end of the end yeah I mean so do not let your hearts be troubled as as Jesus would say now I just want to you know I'm you know I'm gonna go into Exodus a bit more we will get into being ready you know redemption by blood and by power but you know it's one thing we must be very aware of when Jesus would say he would say and he would say at a time when you think not as when the Son of Man will come HUD's and times where we don't think he will come as that's when he will come now endemic might go away this virus might go away and life might return to a semi-normal state we don't know but you know the thing is that we should not become all all religious and all excited just because there's a pestilence struck the land but we should be excited we should be alive and in the Lord Jesus because what he has done for us we have been sealed away by the Holy Ghost I mean we should be ready and waiting for the last Trump to sound and then we're gonna leave and then I'm that soon but you know I just want to say this very very clearly spotting you know it's not about your this day people are so caught up in conspiracy theories you know was it China was it as it is that the United Nations trying to make a one-world government is that you know is at 5g is it you know what is all the stuff and you know I want to say spotting you know let's not be caught up in conspiracy theory right let's not be up on these things l our minds in our heart shouldn't be fixed on trying to spot the bogeyman yeah we shouldn't be trying to spot the boogeyman because we have to recognize just spotting the boogeyman isn't gonna give us rapturing faith not gonna give us rapturing faith one but you know people can see where the enemy is in every detail but yet mr. rapture yeah I mean spotting the boogeyman is not going to help us or trying to find the boogeyman it's not going to help us take a body change yeah right so I'd be so consumed at all it could be this it could be that I mean but what about your own soul a make sure you meet the Lord Jesus are you under the blood I mean have you been that's the most important thing because Jesus said there would be piss Lots in these times so he shouldn't be surprised at this pestilence in the land yeah and we must recognize that your God is not panicking because the world has shut down this has stopped my program what am I gonna do what's plan B he doesn't have a plan because he doesn't need a plan B plan a in a Sunnah is going to the world and preach the gospel cause as a devil or you find him these signs shall follow them that believe you say well we freedom to go preach they were used to maybe not but we're still under a commission right you can still with your phone with you know over the Internet you can still reach people you can still be a witness you can still be salty I mean you still be a living witness even in this time hallelujah so so we shouldn't get so worried about conspiracy theory man is not gonna help you overcome amen I mean we see the Matthew 24 because no no I'll just say this now this might all just blow over and it potentially could might not but a potentially could in those who are it but the problem is when that happens as those who are all excited about conspiracy theory as when life returns back to normal then they actually can become more cynical about the coming of the Lord as I saw I thought he was going to come in when that virus was on all I thought the global crash was going to cause a rapture no I thought this earthquake you know but you know and then but then when life returns back to normal they become cynical and it has become hardened because they are looking at the wrong thing Oh looking at the water God and being caught up in the revelation of the hour then amen when when that happens to a soul they'll be watching and waiting for that day hallelujah the rapture is for the raptured you know we know the word rapture means the catching away it's like an eagle with its talons catching it's prey and taking it away it's wrapped off as the you know it's the catching away so to the rapture are those so the catching away is for those who are caught away in the Word of God for the day no rapture is for the raptured right I mean so so that's the kind of condition we want to be and we want to be caught up in the Lord Jesus want to be in love with him walk rejoicing in our salvation I mean that's how we want to be in this hour we could just become more cynical when this thing blows over is well I thought it was then well other people have been saying it for years it's happening in our and and it just hardens people's hearts now brother Bram would say and the presence of God unrecognized in 1964 he'd say now look you know the coming of the Lord is going to be a secret coming yeah there'll be two in the beard and I'll take one and leave one that's where the nighters turn the field I'll take one and leave one that's the daytime you know there's so many people disappear every day off the face of the earth that nobody can account for one of these days that might be that people might say well you mean the tribulation the thing is on us now I thought the church would go before the tribulation they don't realize and understand that the rapture could take place and they would know nothing about it he says it's the secret going of the church so the rapture is not necessarily just a coming it's actually a secret going all right I mean as the bride being caught away and taken up into glory that is the rapture I mean brother bran would say it's like Romeo and Juliet where where where Romeo comes the little or not puts a ladder up against the house and grab Julie and and runs away with her why because it's a secret going amen and that's the condition we should be ready our lamps trimmed and clear I'll be so full of all he doesn't come today he'll come tomorrow if he doesn't come tomorrow he'll come next week but I'm watching waiting for that moment I know lujah that my whole life is now built around and focused upon that moment where we change to me amen no and then also the thing is when people see one thing is that we need to realize what's going on and not just realize what's going on but become part of it what's going on you see you talking about Doug get caught up and trying to find all the boogie men nothing about your realizing what's going on there I'm talking about the realization as Christ and his bride have become one in this hour I mean that she is robed and the his righteousness ready for the call to the wedding supper in the sky and that's really what's going on remember the whole world the whole world is falling apart because the bride is coming into her position in the word of word of so that's the real thing that's going on and that's the real thing we should be looking for and not just looking at becoming a part of oh yeah I mean because you know we don't want to we don't want to fail because the thing is if we look at all the conspiracy theory I'm just gonna hammer this because I feel I've got a hammer it right now if we if we get caught up in conspiracy theory and what might be in what happens is eventually that will actually just give us unbelief in the message because it will not be it will not equate to what what the prophetess is what the Bible said so he just produce unbelief because what it actually comes down to his people say well brother Bram just didn't know what he was talking about because that's exactly what it will equate to because I said well he didn't know what we were facing him this time he didn't see the technology and the viruses and all these things so he doesn't know what he's talking about so then what does that do that puts unbelief in a person against the Word of God yeah so that's why we shouldn't be caught up in those things we should be caught up in the scripture and the message that's what we should be caught up in remember how can God give a light to an age and then but but that light is only for a certain portion of the age you know in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now we are living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel it didn't say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and then some other people that claim to be a Thane JAL's after doesn't say that says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but that means that that that we're living in the days was voices voice was recorded and that voice is good for the entirety of the age that's why we should not get caught up in conspiracies that belief for now soul saying he didn't know what he was talking about and he knew what he was talking about amen he would say in the evening messenger here we are in time red light down flashing coming of the Lord is at hand yes sir listen the entire message should meet endtime conditions which they got off the message ought to bring it back always in time such meets in time conditions I mean so so that's happened all the way down through the scripture the end time messenger Noah's day met the condition right the yeah you know the message in Moses day met the condition of the age Jesus message met the condition of the age amen so so we're living in an end time again amen where the Gentile dispensation is coming to an end and we've received the message and that message meets in time conditions yourself at meeting in time conditions I'm gonna be focusing on that I mean I'm not gonna be worried about what people think is going on or or you know your people are just presuming and in China you know you're trying to get people distracted now we've received a vindicated voice in this our God came in behind and proved it over and over and over I mean that you this is not having it he said he wanted to be a trapper he said you know he didn't want to do those things but God rich and mercy came amen and manifested himself through his ministry hallelujah they made you see you know like when the seals were coming over and brother hammer would come to the pulpit said well I thought it was this like the first horse rider he says well I'll just take the notes that I had before and maybe this is just what it is but then he said then the Lord came down into the room and told him exactly what the scripture meant hallelujah and then he could see the revelation given to him by the Lord match the scripture exactly you know so and that happened night after night after night so you know this message is not William branham's message amen it has been as God's message hallelujah so now we have to look at then what what we have what what the pressure of this age would be amen so brother Graham would say in the church age book and our trustee of ones following along he sees in the reciter in church age where where Jesus says that all what I will put upon you none other burden he says the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either bend will be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age has its precious for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft loving and nervous tension in a complex age we seem unfit to live in so that's the big pressure of the age its riches yeah off living and nervous tensions complex age that we seem unfit to live and this is a very complex age you know we are we're actually told this is just by I'm psychologists and scientists that it used to be that every day we would receive one newspapers worth of information but now because of we're connected to the world I mean our brain has to process 30 newspapers worth of information every day and we constantly connect them with people with constant connected with what's going on around us it's a very complex age and and because it's so complex there's a lot of nervous tension you know you know life used to be down to not just the hour but the minute not just a minute but the second amen and then what and and so the pressure of the age will be richest and that is the pressure of the age yeah that's why this world is panicking because they're shutting down why because riches of being a you know the economy is falling apart yes great pressure soft loving is a pressure thing is a pressure and nervous tensions those are the pressures or the weights that the believer would have to overcome but thanks be to God amen power of the Holy Ghost yeah so now let's go back to our thought as I said dr. Scofield wrote about you know Redemption it has to come through a person hallelujah and we know that our Redemption came through not a man that was just born of you know you know he was a Jew he wasn't a Gentile but here's God Almighty made flesh in Apostle Paul would say that was the blood of God that was you know you're the Holy Ghost I mean he sees to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood which is the blood of God I mean so our Redemption didn't come through a natural man or even a redeemed man I mean but our redemption came through God becoming a man hallelujah amen so redemption and the New Testament speaks about other definition it means a ransom in full that is amen I mean that means figuratively a written source the Christian salvation I mean so Redemption is a ransom and fall so it's not in part it's not a partial ransom it's not a just well Dibble I'll take a part of them you can have part of them and therefore it's Redemption that's now redemption redemption is a full deliverance I mean it's a full it's a full redemption I mean it is a full ransom hallelujah amen and it also comes from the word which means something to loosen worth I mean that is the redemption price or a ransom so we have been redeemed we've been loosened from the grips of sin I mean from the grips of the devil I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ paid a fool um-um Hosea would speak about Israel being being been called out of Egypt and he'd say and Hosea 11 and 1 he says when Israel was a child I loved him and called my son out of Egypt so so when when God came down into the Ministry of Moses and and God redeemed Israel out of you know you know out of the bondage of slavery that was because God was calling his son I mean out of Egypt out of slavery I mean I mean to to to walk with him now we know that when Israel came out of Egypt there was a mixed multitude went up with him so so it wasn't everyone who came out of Egypt was actually the son of God wasn't his child I mean but Redemption here was was God was calling a part of himself out of Egypt amen I mean to - now coming to the promised land because we know that children are part of the appearance right I've isn't a part of me Amen I mean you're everyone who has children they're a part of you so so the children of God are part of God yeah and God can't lose a part of himself it's impossible I mean he cannot lose one of his he can't lose one of his attributes I mean so he called them called them out of Egypt but in order to call them out of Egypt he had to redeem them by blood he had redeemed them by blood and also redeemed them by power heart and pharaoh said well I'll let them go no God had to come and powerful become a manifestation is glory I mean to break the shackles of of slavery off of the Egypt I mean I mean Rosie I mean God had to play your Pharaoh in his kingdom you know God had to pour out his wrath and pour out his judgment upon you know you know upon Pharaoh and and and all of Egypt so so an order that Pharaoh would eventually say okay you can go and the glorious thing about when when Israel left Egypt everyone came Moses was determined we're not leaving a hoof behind and there was God speaking through Moses to Pharaoh this is God saying to Pharaoh not one of them staying not even our cattle not our young our old they're all coming worth and this is how God is determined to redeem us welcome I'm gonna break the yoke of sin I'm good I'm going to take away their first nature I'm gonna break every shackle of the devil off their lives and they're gonna come hallelujah well then the father has given me will come and all that comes we all know wise cast out okay what a blessed Savior we have yeah so so he had to redeem them by blood and he also had to redeem them by power now now I just want to so and so in Hebrews 11 I mean I mean Hebrews 9 and 11 it says this now you know I hope you don't mind too much reading this is but Christ being made a high priest of good things to come my greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us Alleluia for if the blood of bulls and of goats and of ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirits spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that is by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance yes or a testament is there must also have necessity be the death of the testator for the Testament is a force after Mina did otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood so so the Apostle Paul is telling the Hebrews you know the blood of Jesus Christ gives us a far greater Redemption than the blood of bulls and goats I mean that was just a shadow but now you've got to come into the reality what you know that Jesus as he said would would would go up into glory to receive an eternal redemption for us I mean a hallelujah there so glorious I mean now we know redeem means to buy back to restore back to original position now you know the scripture tells us that our redemption is as completely of God it's not our own ability you know not one man can redeem another you know not one of us can can can can free ourselves from our first nature that we're born with our fallen nature I mean that one of us can can can free ourselves from the chains of sin it takes God to do it I mean God is our Redeemer you know he he is causing in such a way that no man can boast and you know in in his own Redemption God that redeems is God that saves us God that justifies hallelujah so this is why we can rejoice this morning I mean redeemed by blood and by power I mean the blood of Jesus Christ has redeemed us in the power of the Holy Ghost is here to ensure we receive the fullness of our Redemption you know now God would tell Moses and an exodus sex he says wherefore saying to the children of Israel I am the Lord and I'll bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians I will rid you out of their bondage hallelujah I like his language I will deem you with an outstretched arm and with grab desmos I will take I will take you to me for a people and I will be a god and I will be to you a god and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God that brings you out from under the burden of the Egyptians hallelujah amen so you saying I'm gonna do with an outstretched arm I'm gonna redeem you hallelujah I mean I'm gonna rid you of their bondage I mean I'm gonna break the shackles of their slavery completely you're gonna be a free people remember the purpose of it was out of Egypt I have called my sons there's a call went forth unto Egypt and God was calling for his children to come out of the bondage of slavery and walk with him now God would say in the verdict is 26 because we look at the purpose what is the purpose of being you know you know you know of them being freed from slavery it wasn't just that God could see if he could do it there was a purpose and the redemption Amen that God would manifest in Israel and he would say in Leviticus 26 and 11 he says and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you and I will walk among you and will be your God and you shall be my people I am the Lord your God which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that ye should not be their bond men and I have broken the bands of their yoke that ye may go up right those purposes I want to walk among you that's all I want to put my Tabernacle among you that I will walk among you and I'll be your God and you shall be my feet for calling his son out of Egypt I want to walk among you children o at all I want to walk among you my Tabernacle among you ought to be identified with my children I'm going to walk with them hallelujah because I've broken the bands of your yoke that you may go up rise remember that day when we eat when you're burdened down with sitting there's that great yoke of bondage upon your neck but God's I'm gonna break that band of your yoke that you can walk upright the UConnect I know you're not under the whiplash of the evil but you're a son and daughter of God and he can walk upright little you with the Lord but we have to recognize it because of the blood of bulls and goats God could only walk next to the children he could not go any further than just being next to them even even this was shown on Mount Sinai when when when God told Moses yo to come up into the mountain um but he said put a boundary around the mountain because you know because it's going to be a holy mountain cuz I'm gonna come down on that mountain so put a boundary and that no one can no one can come up the mountain either you know they had they had to Stacy's even if a you know a kettle beast or something walked on the mountain they had to be killed and this is because their God Amon could not dwell where an unholy people were I mean I don't know the blood of bulls and goats covered this and it could not change the fallen nature they were born with her yet God could only be you know there was a certain separation still between God and man even though God was walking among them he wanted to put his Tabernacle among them there's still a separation I mean between God and the peoples you know his brother bran would say that that that when God came down Mount Sinai it was death amen to go up the mountain so it was death to step into the pillar fire and that day but because the blood of Jesus Christ has come and rent the veil amen and not just covered our sins but but but washed all our sins away now what stairs not to steppin to the pillar of fire its death not to go into the Holy of Holies Oliver so now it's yo swapped around completely oh so in the old days when God could just walk among them but that wasn't his final you know you know that wasn't really where he wanted to end up because we know that the soul of man is the resting place of God I mean so so his purpose wasn't just to walk among them but was to walk in them amen and then finally Jesus shed his blood because remember there had to be not just a redemption from slavery but they had to be Redemption from the sin nature I mean that we were born with a mean God had to shed his blood upon the earth give a perfect sacrifice I mean that we would be redeemed not just from slavery like the Israelites were I mean but we would be redeemed from our full of nature we were born worth amen and we would be born again God would not just walk with us but he would walk in us all would would write to the Corinthians he'd say in 2nd Corinthians 6 and 16 he says and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people so he's not saying I'm gonna walk I'm gonna walk in you I mean I'm gonna dwell not with you but now in you and I'm gonna walk not next you but I'm gonna walk in them how gay men now that you have the Holy Ghost God is within you I mean when you get out of bed and you walk a man to the kitchen guys walking in you when you go to your family your job Amen that's glory hallelujah now we know he's also called us out of this world but you know we are instructed by the Prophet going into the going into the going into the you know you know the type of the first Passover which we're going to go into now but Israel he sees in the token he says Israel was commanded to stay under that blood until marching orders come so we're actually commanded to stay in Passover until that last Trump sounds I mean then we go from this world to the next world this is this is mere way to focus upon yeah it's not the focus upon boogeymen I mean it's a focus on staying and Passover with our Lord Jesus said that the final plague to strike the church or strike the earth with spiritual death and that is the thing that we need to be aware of as spiritual death is riding in the land amen at a striking people but if you're under the blood of Jesus Christ it cannot strike you the devil can't trick us into becoming lost you are sealed to the day of your Redemption amen the devil can't break that seal cannot break that seal that we cannot get to our final destination right it's impossible for him to unbreak the sealing of the Holy Ghost amen so that means that the devil can't have the Holy Ghost of your seal to the day of your Redemption the devil can't trick you to becoming lost oh right he can't trick you or give you this chip with us right you know the mark of the beast is being spiritual all the way down through the scripture it's not a chip not a detective it's a virtual mark amen true to receive to receive life how do you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the word how do people receive the mark of the beast a religious spirit they reject the word all the way down through the scripture from the marking of Cain all the way down through the scripture has been the mark of the beast but they all come a day when the full manifestation that mark happens but then also the full manifestation of the seal of God will happen manifestations the seal of God will be the change in the body you will recognize what we've been sealed with what we'll be hearing I mean since we met the Lord I mean so we don't need to worry about chips or 5g or whatever G you already hears about the jeast we don't need to worry about those things but if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost you're safe and secure virtual marquise yo you go all the way through the scripture you'll see the seal of God and the seal and and the mark of the beast all the way down through the scripture yes we don't need to worry about those exodia will can't trick you into suddenly becoming lost I mean if you have the Holy Ghost now we're commanded to stay and pass over until the last Trump sounds now just as just as spiritual death was was striking Egypt that night but before spiritual death will come before that death angel rather could come into the land I mean God told Moses to get the people to take a lamb amen take a lamb kill that lamb take the blood strike it on the two doorpost in the upper doorpost of the house and then where and they shall eat that lamb so so they instruct us he said this was the way that that death angel could not strike him as the blood was applied right all the leaven was was was got out of the house right unleavened bread I mean let's just read it shall we Exodus 12 and 5 see these things you know the types become more of a reality in this day yeah more of a real thing becomes my you know we can you say well I've heard about you know you know applying the token of her about eating the lamb of y'all heard about the Passover maybe for decades but they can't succumb a time where it become so real I mean because we could actually see now this is the state I'm living in and we took God calls me home as I said spiritual death is riding in this last age that's what the death angel was striking Egypt but now we live in a time I mean where we're just as they were under the bloodsafe the Israelites were or actually anyone could have done it I believe it they didn't have to just me otherwise they just take the word of Moses apply the blood as they are instructed and they would have been fine I mean as the same now it's even greater today amen we're where we have the Word of God we can apply the Word of God we can do it in faith apply the blood and faith I mean and that death angel can't you know that spiritual death can't get us but we're safe until that last trumpet sounds know says you shall take you shall your lamb this is an exodus 12 and 5 your lamb shall be without blemish a male or the first year you shall take it out from the Sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening why the Bloods got to be applied in the evening time and we're living in the eastern time I mean the time is cleaning with eternity time is running out it's the evening time and you shall take of the blood and strike it on the toy to doorpost and the upper doorpost of the houses ruin you shall eat it and you shall eat the flesh and that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat it not eat not of it raw nor sodden it all with water but roast with fire hid with his legs and with the pertinent parts thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste that is the Lord's Passover I mean so this is the instructions that that Israel was given this is how they had - this is how they had to apply the blood so now we know I just want you to notice this here with a blood had to be applied in three places the two doorpost and the ne and the lintel of the door you know it's exactly the same thing with us today the blood has to be applied in three places I mean it can't just be a member where a body is spirit and a soul that's the places right you can't just many people just apply the blood to this to their flesh and they get healed and God doesn't work I mean but but that's not the final place many people also will just allow the blood to be applied to this skirt they'll get anointed they'll dance they'll shout they'll singing yeah you know speaking tongues that's good but that's not all three places all right so set the blood is applied to the soul of the person and that's where the blood must be applied in the stay I mean because remember you can be justified without being you know you can be justified I'm in both out being sanctified without having the Holy Ghost otherwise you can be sanctified without being justified and not being sealed under the kingdom not having the Holy Ghost in your soul but you must have all three and all three constitute the new birth so you can't just have the blood applied to your spirit and shout and rejoice I mean go to a special meeting we'll have a wonderful time in church and then go out the same way having the same nature that you came and worth I mean for anger and malice and strife and envy and hatred and you know you're tearing people down and assembling people and murdering people's influence I mean that's an unconverted person we don't want to be that kind of way we were able to change our nature and our nature is only truly changement is a birth in the soul and then now the life that's in the soul comes forth and takes control of the spirit of man that is that is where the blood must be applied in the soul so not just their bodies I mean remember three places it had to be applied not just on your flesh not just in your spirit I mean but in your on your flesh and your spirit and in your soul that's where the apply amen now he sees he and you shall eat the flesh on that night roast it with fire I mean we don't want to just eat this you know you don't eat it raw I mean not not sudden or with water I mean so that's the same thing when people take the word they they eat the word there's gonna be fire there there's gonna be the Holy Ghost there I mean the only reality of God burning it can be sudden just with you you know you're full of water I mean uncooked I'm in the world alive it's gonna be cooked it's gonna be living fire the Holy Ghost in the soul in the heart of a person I mean when they received the word that's that's now the lamb comes in and is roasted I mean you can't take the message you can't take the Word of God in an intellectual standpoint they started with water that's not cooked I mean that one feeder person then one satisfy them but it's when the word is mixed with fire with the Holy Ghost at hallelujah this is how we must ingest the yeah this is how we eat our lamb the lamb lamb as the wood of God a mother because because the lamb they walked all the way into the promised land I mean under the TWiT the strength of that lamb hallelujah there's a supernatural thing I mean so we don't just want to eat it amen it shouldn't be raw amen as you be with water but roasted with fire it's hid with its legs and with the pertinent parts thereof so don't just take out all the nice parts of the word that you like you know many people you know Paul said Paul said that has a shamed of the cross of Christ he was not ashamed of it you know many people will only take the glorious parts of what they consider to be of the scripture you know in our days we think Jesus dying on the cross it's a glorious thing there's no shame in it we think but in reality you know if you went back into Paul's day and Paul was actually trying to witness to someone and someone we are you know they weren't a believer that say do you tell me that your God became a man and he was executed by by yoyoyo he was found guilty and the Romans crucified him the most shameful death anyone could suffer you mean your great King of glory who made all things he died this way but Paul says I wasn't ashamed he wasn't ashamed of that it wasn't shamed of that controversy if Jesus was born in our day and what is what is the what is the death you know you know the death penalty is administered today by Richard she rose by you know your by firing squad or hanging or you know measured if we sit down you know the Messiah came what happened to him well he died how did he die he was killed by electric chair you think hold on this is this has gone a bit sideways just like Jesus dying on the cross we don't think about their approach that that was actually although the or the shame that that seemed to have but Paul said I'm not ashamed of that right he didn't just preach the power and the glory and the redemption and the and you know going to heaven and you know healing and casting out the devil he said I'm not ashamed of the pertinent parts they're off you know so he didn't just give the Catlett's and all the nice cuts of the lamb but but he gave the whole thing yeah he said I'm not shunned to declare unto you the full counsel of God nor a mean so so we have to take even the bits of the word that we don't seem to like all you know why do I have to eat that but why do we have to maybe this with Trish in here and whatever it is behind those things I mean so you know we just could eat the whole lamb the whole Word of God will it'll do you good any man amen so to eat the hidden hidden legs Britain impostor I'll take the whole lamb amen ace is thus you shall eat it he also says with with unleavened bread you to get all the living out of your house I mean out of all the humble is no but this is what we must guard against is only what of God and the devil will come and suddenly as I said before and he would try and get us to doubt put doubt on the scripture put doubt on the Word of God that's leaven right you do unbelief out of your house amen amen so we're gonna have it with unleavened bread amen and thus you shall eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste so he doesn't say and you shall sit on your couch with your feet up amen not ready to march it's like it's idiot casual you don't know you don't be dressed you got to be ready so I hand shoes on your feet I mean you gotta eat your haste your loins girded amen because this is the Lord's Passover this is a this should be the attitude of the believer Lord I'm ready I mean you gave me the word I'm rubbing on your righteousness the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean I'm uh I'm you know I'm wearing the garment hallelujah I got shoes on my feet I'm ready to leave at any moment amen do you ever be that you never just you know you know it should never be in the back of our mind I wish I had more time to do such and such and such yeah you know I wish I had time to to to to go to Switzerland ah yeah I'd like to go there oh I wish I had time to do that you know it'll be regret of earthly things we should be ready as y'all the Lord's coming I'm ready to go attitude I got my shoes on my loins are girded staff in my hand I'm ready to walk this is how we should be amen he sees this he sees this in Redemption by power in 1954 he sees and now none of it remained everything now he said when you eat it don't eat it raw or sodden but you must eat it well-cooked he says and I like that people are trying to eat the word they just take it like it was raw you're nuts spit on it and everything else said oh I just can't take it I can't stand it it hasn't cooked done enough that's all he said cooker with fire fire represents the Holy Ghost yes God in your heart first and it'll cook it for you that's right now you can't stand now you can't stand off like this I'm outside and say well I don't know whether it's for me or not that might be four days gone by just kick the Holy Ghost first and watch what divine healing means to you then look what what a heartfelt religion means to you then when you've got the Holy Ghost here to cook the lamb as it comes Amy and that's right cook the lamb first and you have to have fire to cook it worth it should be roasted hallelujah he said he seasoned Queen of Sheba therefore while we are living and have our right mind we long to find peace and to know that the blood has been applied at the lintel of door of our hearts and upon the post and we stand in reverence today before thee to ask you to cover our sins and unbelief with the blood of the Lord Jesus I mean I mean that and at that day we might stand faultless of blameless and the prints of God covered by the blood of his own son hallelujah no as I said from the token messages or I was commanded to stay under that blood until marching orders come and this is how our life should be I mean we should be in Passover eating the land that's been roasted with bitter herbs with bread oh my put away all the leaven of malice and strife I mean when you come to this feast come with sincerity and you know this feast of sincerity and truth put away all the Liberals and strife I mean stop trying to compete your self with others in the church or others around the world or we're not called to compare ourselves with ourselves tells us if we compare ourselves with ourselves we are unwise yeah I mean so so if you're unwise you're foolish or you don't want to be the foolish virgin the foolish virgins caught up and everything but having the oil in the lamp no I mean so we don't want to be those kind of people we want to put away all malice and strife and envy who cares about what's happened or what will happen what these people are doing or not doing what about you that's the main hey it should be we should be ready waiting for our marching orders to come and we know that our marching orders it was the last Trump when the dead in Christ arising and our bodies will be changed we're gonna meet them meet the Lord with them in the air I mean so we should be the end of the blood waiting for it's time to coming we should be under expectations hallelujah I mean because remember we're a day closer to us coming the war yesterday I mean people people our countdown to Christmas that countdown to all kinds of things why can't we countdown to the rapture oh yeah well you don't know the dayal but I know the condition of the world room and the conditions of the world say it's pretty close amen I mean so we should be we should be very very much getting ready and waiting for that gravity all day yes commander blood till marching orders come don't go out from under it when once under that token they were sealed in their shoes don't leave that they stayed right there until the midnight struck and the trumpets blowed and when the trumpets blowed the old ram's horns begin to blow each one marched out with his provision going to the promised land yeah so does a man or woman who has filled with the Holy Ghost he sealed away and secured from all harm endanger his whole life displays what he is I mean where the heat walks whatever business he does whoever he talks with when he comes in contact with woman when he comes in contact with associates when he comes in contact with everything that token is laying there I mean when it comes to death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me that token lays there when it comes to the resurrection he'll be there for God will raise him up at the last day Jesus when I see the blood the token I'll pass over you oh I mean so everything everything everyone we come in contact with I mean our life should display the token of God yeah brother Brown you know brother Billy Paul Brenham said about his father he said he brother Brown spoke of his enemies and his friends exactly the same way you could not tell who was this friend of who was his enemy Wow we should take a leaf out of that book doesn't matter who we're talking about we should talk about them exactly the same way he just loved everybody we should love everybody hey we should treat everyone the same way same way but why could he talk like that why because the token was on display I mean it's more than just talking about the message it's the message putting on flesh and you and I we see the fruit of the Spirit living in our lives amen oh nice is doesn't the Patmos version this is the you know the church will say it well Dogma this is no good and that's no good when God gives you the Holy Ghost that settled you know where you stand you know what has happened and you're sealed all the way to the day of your Redemption your destination of this earthly journey oh my that ought to make everybody just have faith and believe God just to rise up in the power and the Holy Ghost Oh Lou yeah we have a short token today I mean the Holy Ghost seal is sure it's safe amen those who are under it a safe and secure they don't need to worry about no coronavirus only worry about the world economics falling apart and in Warren God's economy a main cause was Ravens to feed it you know the prophet Elijah I mean he can take care of you and I brother Donnie Reagan's I'm sermon that I put on the church what's that he said he went to India and and there was a widow woman there in India who exactly had the same supernatural miracle of God God supplying food like the widow woman that man you're the meal barrel Giver ran out and the cruisers world never went dry and it happened exactly the same thing till Widow so forgetting you know alcohol is still the same God comes on the scene it's not in the good times yeah at seven when crisis strikes as when hardship comes that's when he really proves himself it is very easy to be in a camp word of convention shouting and dancing and floor yeah you know heavy a glorious time but God really really proves himself when the chips are down I mean when trouble strikes when sickness comes in yeah that's when God proves themselves what is this what is this crisis striking the earth it's actually God may allowing an opportunity to prove himself like never before that's right I mean we've never been through any of these things before but God is not worried God is not thing to happen cuz I'm gonna prove myself to my children like never when we think of being you know you know redemption as I've said Redemption must come through a man came through God becoming a man our Lord Jesus Christ Redemption must be by blood I mean it we're being loosed by the blood of Jesus cross from our sins but also redemption must come by power mmm I just want you to think about this for a second now huh what kind of power are we how's the mind I'm just gonna say a few things it's not ah it's not the power it's not the power of the mind it says not mind over matter we that is not the power that we are redeemed by yeah we are not redeemed by the power of human will yeah this is not some self-help you know the gospel is not seven steps to overcoming sends away makes the people it's not the power of a church I mean we are not redeemed by the power of a church that's not the it's not the church structure that is the power for us to be redeemed by we're not redeemed by the power of a church we are redeemed by the power of God himself we are redeemed by as the power of God himself member you know he defeated his enemy that down Calvary our enemy doesn't have the keys to his own house now God is now what is he doing now he's actually here to manifest the victory he won that day in your life we go to crisis God wants to prove his power but [Music] I want to say the power we are redeemed by his resurrection power you're redeemed by blood we're redeemed by power and that power is a resurrection power is not just a power that makes us to be good church people but that power we redeem bias to give us a new body holy is it be we redeem by you know as brother Baris special thing in the later part of his ministry he would he would he would quote Romans the eighth chapter he says of Christ being you remember we're facing Easter next weekend he says but if Christ being your body is dead because of sin but the Spirit of but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies yes that dwelleth in you so that is the power I meant so we're redeemed by power that power is a resurrection power your message I mean would be put under our feet hallelujah and these babies would be transformed in the moment of the twinkling of an eye so we don't redeem by a church we're not redeemed by a man only I mean but but we're redeemed by the power of God and it is resurrection hallelujah that's why brother Branham you go searching the message is what is going on in the same time Mahon of the resurrection yes I mean just as the Prophet Jonas Jesus says would it be in the belly of the whale three days and nights I mean so this generation shall receive a sign and what was the sign of the Prophet Jonas resurrection resurrection now this what is being done in the church all today is the sign of the resurrection where God would come down into a redeemed son Oh hallelujah and he would speak to that redeemed son it's just like you know brother Brahim said about Moses he said he said Moses was just Moses until the Spirit of God came upon him and God spoke through him that that was God speaking through Moses but then when the anointing lifted he was just Moses again there brother Ram said I'm just your brother but went but I'm waiting for him to come angel Lord came down and the sign of the resurrection was done again the thoughts intents of the hearts were revealed addresses were given all kinds of things were shown that hallelujah basically the same sign that Jesus did amen to the woman at the well and everyone's it was the sign of the resurrection right hallelujah so now we're living in a resurrection hour why yeah because you don't think why was the sign of the resurrection done because there's a resurrection going to happen I mean is that when when that sign was done the first time when when I'm God came down and spoke to Abraham and Sarah why was it done because their bodies had to be resurrected had to be made young again in order for any of Isaac did in terms of they couldn't have children but they're well past that age so now they had to be brought back to life again that they could have children yeah a so the sovereign God asked Abraham where Sarah thy wife and and and and and and Abraham said she's in the team behind you and then God said to Abraham according to time of life you're gonna have the promised son and we know time of life always speaks about a woman right and then Sarah and the team behind God laughs laughs within her heart saying how can I have a son on you on well past aging my you know you know my husband is as well I think I said why did Sarah laugh why he knew what she was thinking yeah the reason that God did that is because God had to come reveal himself to Sarah that Sarah would judge him faithful where the bride judges and faithful that he said is the rapture of the church we have to come a little place where we believe him and judge him faithful God you you are faithful and fulfilling your promise to the soul resurrection was done they could not have children because their past age but they they they received new bodies young bodies they made young again what happened their resurrected in that way all my children because was my resurrection was done because a resurrection was going to happen and then Jesus came and that same because the same God that that visited Abraham there on the plains of Mamre and Genesis chapter 18 is the same God that became flesh in Jesus Christ and that same sign was done through his ministry why because a resurrection was going to happen I mean so when Jesus arose from the grave I mercy as many of the Saints that slept there with him why there was a resurrection hallelujah when when King David would you know wrote down in the Psalms lift up ye gates I mean lift up your heads o ye gates yeah yo that the King of glory will come in they asked who is the king of glory and his response the Lord is the king of glory mighty in battle so so what he was looking at when he was anointed to write that Psalm is here is actually looking at the Lord coming out of the grave I mean leading leaving the Old Testament Saints up into glory that they arose with him so now here was David and he was pinning down this prophecy but there came a time when he manifested that prophecy well he would have been standing there the Lord you know yo yo he arose with the Lord and then they went up into glory and he's standing before the gates of glory and then he is actually part of the voices saying lift up ye lift up ye hear ye I just like to think that he was singing the back of his mind I wrote this down [Applause] but he was living in the fulfillment of the prophecy what happened a razor rig happened after the sign of the resurrection was done hallelujah we come to this day the side of the reservoir sign of the resurrection was done over and over again why because a resurrection was coming now was the season of the resurrection hallelujah also says the sign of the resurrection actually the believer becomes the sign of the resurrection because we were once dead in trespasses and sins right we were aliens from God we didn't know him we just you know the devil would lead us around we did all different kinds of things I think God quickened us made us alive in him hallelujah so the things that once stood we cannot do no more because God has changed our nature the thing you know we just can't do them because you ain't the appetite for them anymore he's worthless of all our sins and the believer becomes the sign of the resurrection to the age I'm looking at people all the sign of the resurrection being quick and made alive by the holy ghost amen yes Amen Breezies now what is the Holy Ghost I mean I mean this isn't the message what is the Holy Ghost he says today we don't walk by the shadow of the law we walk by the power of the Resurrection we walk by the power of the Spirit who is our true seal our true advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar odd people acting funny taking God at His Word calling everything else wrong God's Word is right oh my that's what the Holy Ghost is I mean so do not let your hearts be troubled all these things must needs be that's right I remember Jesus said in the hour you think not that's when the Son of Man comes oh yes so there's quite a stir in the you know in the same time what's going on is this when the Beast will take over all these things whatever more but it's a now you think not so I'll say this this thing might just go away remember jesus said there'll be pistol ins amen a pestilence is an epidemic there'll be pestilence earthquakes diverse places Wars rumors of wars all these things now but it's just the beginning of Sorrows so we shouldn't be surprised that these things have have have come upon the earth we shouldn't be surprised we're living in this kind of thing but the main thing that we should be focused on is are we in Passover are we waiting for that final trumpet to sound do we have our shoes on our feet staff in our hand eating it in haste under expectation hope it's gonna go children wanna go in a rapture meets in time conditions oh he'll be my lawyer yeah let's all pray together shall we before I turn
