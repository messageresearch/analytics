[23:45] a Believer is always on the positive
[23:47] side amen why is it like that when we go
[23:51] through so many challenges when we go
[23:54] through difficulties why why is a
[23:56] believer in Evergreen because what we

[24:24] [Music]
[24:27] minus zero that's why I believe is
[24:30] always happy
[24:31] because every time the enemy comes you
[24:34] say

[34:03] are proud of you
[34:05] the Lord Jesus is very proud of you
[34:07] for what you are doing for the kingdom
[34:09] of God and you know using these physical
[34:12] bodies to spread the gospel you know to
[34:15] go and look for that that Last Ship and
[34:17] bring it home amen so as without any
[34:20] waste of time um I would like us to
[34:22] speak tonight if you can just go to the
[34:25] title Talia where's that little Gadget
[34:28] you know is it available
[34:30] and I can use it to to manage my
[34:33] nervousness and we want to talk about
[34:35] this subject that the Lord put on my
[34:37] heart
[34:38] I Was preparing a salmon and I I was
[34:40] finished thank you so much brother and
[34:43] then I was finished
[34:44] and then
[34:46] just as I finish I I deleted it
[34:50] by mistake
[34:52] and and there everything disappeared
[34:56] I didn't even tell my wife
[34:58] I just said Lord help me
[35:01] and I said Lord probably
[35:04] you didn't want it the way I put it so
[35:06] probably the Lord wanted it the way he
[35:08] wanted to put me under pressure and I
[35:11] let him select what he wants to select
[35:13] for his people amen so um that if you
[35:19] hear me stammering and going that way
[35:21] and not being organized a little bit
[35:22] just know that I deleted my my sermon by
[35:26] mistake and I searched everywhere
[35:28] you know you know the feeling every day
[35:30] you know that feeling
[35:31] when you see just after pressing
[35:35] and his ark is gone so that what
[35:37] happened to me but I want us to read
[35:39] about I mean to talk about this thought
[35:42] you know many of you will know the
[35:44] meaning of the way I wrote Nazarite the
[35:46] the spelling I made it wrong on purpose
[35:49] it's supposed to be NZ
[35:51] Nazi but I put n a z a because that's
[35:55] how the prophet said it
[35:59] said NASA right so I thought I can put
[36:02] it that way but when we read in the Book
[36:05] of Genesis we hear about we know the
[36:07] story all of us we know the story about
[36:09] Abraham and Lord separating we know the
[36:11] story about Abraham and Lord going
[36:13] separate ways and the choices of Lord
[36:16] and the choice you look at the attitude
[36:19] of Lord and the attitude of Abraham
[36:23] Abraham says to him hey look if you
[36:26] choose the left I'll go to the right if
[36:29] you choose the right I'll go to the left
[36:31] ah isn't that a wonderful thing for a
[36:34] brother to say that to you brother if
[36:36] you take this one I'll take this one if
[36:38] you take this I'll take this choice is
[36:40] yours he gave Lord a choice and Lord
[36:43] made a choice
[36:45] Abraham's Choice was take this I'll take
[36:48] that or take this out anyway I'm fine
[36:52] but what is amazing about this scripture
[36:55] as you read it at the end
[36:57] the Lord
[36:59] after they've now separated the Lord
[37:01] says to Abraham hey look to the north
[37:04] the East the South and the West
[37:07] everything that you see I'll give it to
[37:10] you the question is what happened now to
[37:12] to Lord's portion
[37:14] that's the question because Lord
[37:16] obviously Lord went either to the left
[37:18] or right as the Bible says but God says
[37:21] everything around all directions I'm
[37:24] gonna give it to you not only you even
[37:27] your seed
[37:28] as brother John was preaching there at
[37:30] the camp even in your family
[37:32] look to the left and right because
[37:34] Abraham separated himself
[37:38] and he did not have a wrong attitude he
[37:40] said if you take the left I take that's
[37:43] how God rewards you when you give
[37:46] everything to him and say Lord choose
[37:48] for me
[37:49] amen look at that attitude but let's
[37:52] move forward I want us to talk about
[37:54] this Nazarite
[37:55] because Abraham is is is that seat of
[37:58] the Nazarite
[38:00] let's look at him let's go to judges
[38:04] Judges chapter 13.
[38:06] I hope this time I won't read
[38:09] a wrong scripture
[38:12] judges 13.
[38:15] and then we'll start
[38:17] if I'm not mistaken from verse one but I
[38:19] would like us to focus on a specific
[38:21] verses
[38:22] 31
[38:25] .
[38:27] now
[38:28] as you all know in the Bible there was a
[38:30] time when the children of Israel did not
[38:33] have Kings
[38:34] they did not have any specific men
[38:37] leading them they had judges that would
[38:40] rule them and guide them and judge
[38:41] matters for them you know you know of
[38:43] Deborah you know of Samson you know of
[38:47] many many of them right so this was
[38:49] during the time round about when Samson
[38:52] was going to be born
[38:53] amen the Bible says and the children of
[38:56] Israel did Evil
[38:58] again in the sight of the Lord
[39:00] and the Lord delivered them into the
[39:03] hand of the Philistine 40 years
[39:06] I'm 46. that means since I was born
[39:11] minus six years I don't know how many of
[39:14] you here are fought
[39:15] but
[39:16] for 40 years
[39:18] they were delivered in the hands of the
[39:20] of the Philistines
[39:23] children were born knowing that we
[39:25] served the Philistines
[39:26] because of just doing evil before God
[39:31] what happens to us to ask you evil
[39:33] before the Lord today
[39:36] We Are Spiritual Israel right are we
[39:39] spiritual Israel
[39:41] so verse 2.
[39:43] and there was a certain man of Zora the
[39:47] family of the Denis whose name was Manoa
[39:50] and his wife was Barren and Bernard
[39:54] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[39:56] the woman
[39:57] and said unto her behold now Thou Art
[40:01] Baron in Barris note bear is not but
[40:04] Thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[40:07] God always appeared
[40:09] to his people even if they are in a
[40:12] Philistine control
[40:14] God will appear there's always a sense a
[40:17] sense and a threat of Hope with the Lord
[40:19] amen you will never lose it all with the
[40:21] Lord
[40:22] now
[40:24] now therefore beware I pray thee and
[40:27] drink not wine no strong drink and eat
[40:30] not any unclean thing I ask myself I say
[40:34] my what are the spiritual what's the
[40:36] spiritual meaning of this verse
[40:38] this woman is going to be to Bear a son
[40:42] and the angel is telling her don't drink
[40:45] and don't touch and clean things but
[40:47] it's not hair who's going to lead and
[40:49] and deliver Israel it's the Hassan but
[40:52] God says no you don't do that
[40:56] so today me and you right we are bearing
[41:00] children right today me and you we we we
[41:03] we've got the word of God conceived in
[41:06] US
[41:08] filled
[41:11] yes right are we together are you
[41:15] following the spiritual point that I'm
[41:17] trying to put across today me and you
[41:19] we've got we've got a baby right we are
[41:22] conceived with the Holy Spirit here
[41:24] right and we we we we we are supposed to
[41:28] not touch wine
[41:32] of the devil huh and clean things we are
[41:35] not supposed to touch them to be a
[41:37] Nazarite to become a netherite of God we
[41:41] are supposed to be separated not touch
[41:43] anything I'm trying to be here not on
[41:45] the on the negative one not on the
[41:47] physical I'm trying to be on that let me
[41:49] not say here I'm trying to be on a
[41:50] spiritual level
[41:52] think spiritually don't think physical
[41:54] when I say wine because we drink wine
[41:56] here at church think spiritual you're
[41:58] not supposed to be touching I'm not
[42:00] supposed to be touching that because I'm
[42:01] a Nazareth the mother of the Nazarite
[42:04] God already tells her don't touch this
[42:07] don't touch this can you see it
[42:09] that has got implications to me and you
[42:12] who have got a a very important person
[42:15] the person of Jesus Christ in US
[42:19] what that means is that
[42:23] I don't know what measurement can I give
[42:26] you but
[42:28] from tall
[42:30] to her from all across the three spheres
[42:34] of your body
[42:37] are we together
[42:38] let's let's continue with it let's just
[42:40] calm down and relax and enjoy reading
[42:43] the word of God right
[42:45] for law that's five for Lord Thou shalt
[42:49] conceive and bear a son and no razor
[42:52] shall come on his head
[42:55] for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
[42:57] God from the womb and he shall begin to
[43:02] deliver Israel out of the hand of the
[43:05] philistine
[43:06] this boy is going to be another right
[43:09] from the womb of the mother
[43:14] amen I want I want to jump to
[43:18] um
[43:20] okay I wanna leave it there amen so
[43:24] nothing must be done on his head
[43:27] the matter must not even drink wine the
[43:29] mother must not touch any unclean thing
[43:31] because this boy is going to be another
[43:34] right
[43:35] so you want to look at this Nazarite and
[43:37] and understand the meaning of being a
[43:41] Nazarite because you must understand
[43:43] brothers and sisters that
[43:46] before God could call us okay let's just
[43:49] look at what a real and a Nazarite could
[43:52] be meaning according to Dr Google and
[43:54] all who can explain in the historical
[43:57] you know background in the Jewish
[43:59] religion you know the Bible it says that
[44:01] another right is in Hebrew meaning Naza
[44:05] right to abstain from
[44:09] to to to to to to to be away from
[44:12] something
[44:13] right and to and also to concentrate
[44:17] oneself
[44:19] to concentrate
[44:21] to concentrate means to give over you
[44:24] know to to all of you you know to pour
[44:27] yourself all of your being to give it
[44:31] to God
[44:33] right to consecrate to to all your life
[44:37] everything about you is about your
[44:39] Nazarite vow your Nazarite identity
[44:44] that's what that boy was going to be and
[44:46] among the ancient Hebrews
[44:49] um a sacred person whose separation was
[44:52] most commonly distinguished by his how
[44:57] was that
[44:58] uncut hey
[45:00] right and cut hair and uh sorry I can't
[45:04] see properly there I should have made
[45:05] them bigger because now abstinence from
[45:09] wine
[45:11] and from all the other things so there
[45:13] is a sign for a Nazarite in those days
[45:17] they will see a person with long hair
[45:19] and cut hair and cut hair a person who
[45:22] does not go where it mixed with the way
[45:24] the corpses are you know the dead people
[45:26] a person who does not drink there were
[45:28] some signs and there was some outward
[45:30] signs
[45:31] that will show that this man is a
[45:34] narrower is a Netherland and to be to be
[45:37] able to say to be of God service
[45:40] that was the purpose the purpose was
[45:42] because that person had a gift of God
[45:45] and that's the right will have a gift of
[45:47] God given from birth from before you
[45:49] were born you had the angel talking
[45:51] about the Nazareth and that person would
[45:54] would be coming not only uh something to
[45:59] be a Nazarite was to to be a deliverer a
[46:02] leader a warrior for your people you'll
[46:05] have a gift there will be different
[46:07] kinds of of gifts obviously I will
[46:09] believe I would imagine but a Nazarite
[46:11] will have specific things that we will
[46:14] know that this man is
[46:16] ah this one is saying that's all right
[46:18] hair was predominantly the one the way
[46:21] you live the gift that you have the way
[46:24] you are not you know because you are a
[46:26] Nazarite so you are a never right today
[46:29] because you are born with a gift
[46:32] you will see now do you believe you're
[46:33] born with a gift
[46:35] how many don't believe that they've got
[46:37] a gift
[46:37] do you believe you've got a gift
[46:40] I thought I thought I'll hear amen
[46:43] amen you have a gift let me put it a
[46:47] little bit chilly whether you believe it
[46:49] or not
[46:51] you have a gift God has given you a gift
[46:54] and you are a chosen child today when
[46:58] this world could not bear bright God
[47:01] came and said hey you are going to bring
[47:03] a bride
[47:05] let me not go ahead of myself right I
[47:08] want to show you something here
[47:11] few will will take that little girl on
[47:14] top you know for dinner and then he just
[47:17] come for dinner two hours and just go
[47:19] straight to the table with those hands
[47:21] tell me
[47:22] how many of you
[47:24] how many of you will that man come in
[47:27] the house and then you just give them a
[47:29] room and let them not even a shall just
[47:31] go and sleep and then there's a room
[47:34] huh how many of you
[47:36] when you come across that kind of a
[47:38] person you you and it comes to your
[47:40] house or comes inside your car or next
[47:43] to you without touching you you you you
[47:46] want to move it
[47:49] you want to say Sir can we help you
[47:51] right look at those hands if I come and
[47:55] you are calling me for dinner to eat I
[47:57] come with hands like this and I go
[47:58] straight to the plate what are you going
[48:00] to say to me
[48:02] what are you going to say
[48:05] you're gonna say brother that day Becca
[48:08] will call me uncle
[48:10] yeah that that the uncle no no no no no
[48:14] come let me show you the bathroom
[48:16] huh but let me tell you something
[48:19] that is you
[48:23] that is you before that is your picture
[48:27] I wanted a picture that will be as
[48:30] disgusting as possible
[48:31] but I couldn't find it
[48:34] me and you
[48:36] are disgusting saved by grace
[48:42] the problem is this many times we accept
[48:46] it on face value
[48:48] you know a face body's face value sister
[48:50] Esther
[48:51] face value
[48:53] is shallow we accept that ah yes I'm a
[48:57] sinner Say by Grace Lord thank you for
[48:58] saving me but not deeply acknowledging
[49:02] inside our hearts because that is the
[49:04] point of turning that is the point of
[49:06] repentance that is the point of
[49:08] receiving your blessing the point of
[49:10] realizing who you are is actually at
[49:13] when you are realizing oh Lord that Me
[49:16] Lord
[49:18] I'm ashamed of myself Lord
[49:21] had it not been for you I would have
[49:23] remained like this
[49:25] dirty stinking wretched and good for
[49:29] nothing
[49:31] that's me
[49:33] good for nothing
[49:34] and the sooner I realized that because
[49:37] it's one thing to tell ourselves that oh
[49:39] we are the Bride of God we are the Bride
[49:41] of God and we are his Chosen One
[49:44] that's wonderful
[49:46] but it's not just coming just because I
[49:49] say it or you say it
[49:52] there must be that acknowledgment that
[49:54] nah in my language me means na
[49:58] Brother Andy will tell you
[50:00] not me I'm like that
[50:04] before God saved me you know we always
[50:06] see people going to
[50:08] um
[50:09] you know on weight programs and they
[50:11] show you before and after you know that
[50:13] kind of a thing he'll actually knew
[50:15] before and after brother they like to
[50:17] say uh you know they all they want you
[50:20] to focus on the after
[50:23] but that's the important part but this
[50:25] part
[50:25] is important
[50:27] it is not important it's important not
[50:29] because we want to praise the devil not
[50:31] because we are proud but because one
[50:33] forever knowledge and thank God
[50:36] changing us from who we are for for what
[50:39] a mercy what a Grace that God clean pure
[50:44] holy God
[50:46] will come stoop so low to a stinking
[50:49] thing like me like that
[50:52] and come and save me let's not play Holy
[50:55] Holy
[50:56] we were like that West
[50:58] some of us West I was worse
[51:02] worse than that
[51:04] horrible
[51:05] but I'm not proud I don't want to talk
[51:07] and think about it and one day the devil
[51:10] always sometimes bring it
[51:12] but you see the key is this
[51:15] when we realize that you are like that
[51:18] the key is not to put your focus on
[51:21] there
[51:22] the kids to put your focus on here
[51:24] you see because that
[51:27] if you realize how you are
[51:30] and you realize who you are now
[51:32] man you explode you you you realize that
[51:36] I was like this because the Bible says
[51:39] and he tells us and the change has come
[51:42] completely 360 Degrees like we were now
[51:46] opposite
[51:47] from like the East is from the East and
[51:50] the West will never meet they will never
[51:52] come across
[51:53] you know mountains they say mountains
[51:56] they even meet with their Shadows but
[51:58] the East and the West will never meet
[52:00] that's how God changed you you were like
[52:03] this and he changed you you're like this
[52:06] you are so dirty and so stinky and I
[52:09] know you are so smelling good
[52:11] that's what God did in your life
[52:14] if you focus only on what he did
[52:18] and how you are
[52:20] as I was listening to Brother Andy
[52:23] saying many people who want to focus on
[52:26] the god of yesterday and the what he
[52:29] will do tomorrow not what he's doing now
[52:33] if you acknowledge all those
[52:35] what you are what you wear
[52:38] it will be better and very easy for you
[52:40] to acknowledge the now
[52:43] the after
[52:44] because you know where I'm coming from
[52:47] but if you put a slight doubt of saying
[52:50] I was not so bad
[52:52] ha ha
[52:53] your pride will come in
[52:56] your attitude won't be right
[52:58] everything about what you are going
[53:00] talking you might even acknowledge the
[53:02] clean part after with pride thinking
[53:05] that you deserve it
[53:07] can you see how important it is it's
[53:08] very important to understand that I am
[53:10] filthy
[53:12] but Hallelujah by his grace I am clean
[53:15] that is why it's so important all the
[53:17] time when we speak
[53:19] the Lord is willing
[53:20] our husband must be involved in every
[53:23] thought that goes through our minds
[53:26] because it's him after all it we owe it
[53:29] all to him
[53:31] therefore how does this relate to
[53:34] another right
[53:35] because another ride is someone who is
[53:38] separated is someone who does not mix so
[53:42] I just wanted to pass this thought
[53:43] through with you that hey there is a
[53:46] before and there is an after
[53:49] and they are all equally important of
[53:51] course the important thing is the
[53:53] present tense where I'm going what I am
[53:57] now
[53:58] what what what I was
[54:01] is only
[54:02] a a process of bringing me to my real me
[54:08] but I'm so thankful because what I was
[54:10] I'm no more and the things that I used
[54:13] to do I do them no more because if the
[54:16] full acknowledgment of of this
[54:21] helps you
[54:23] to actually take this with humbleness
[54:26] to take this with so so so what is the
[54:30] word brother ending sobriety yeah is
[54:33] that the right word
[54:34] with with sobriety that's the way the
[54:36] sobriety
[54:38] thank you so much brother Andy Brother
[54:41] Andy brother because
[54:43] he's got the right ways
[54:46] sobriety you know all humbleness all all
[54:50] meekness you don't you want to say no no
[54:53] we we will be so happy and so thankful
[54:55] knowing who we were
[54:59] are we together
[55:00] sometimes
[55:03] it's not easy to accept this because you
[55:05] know there's still some element of this
[55:09] and we talk to you we ask you we look at
[55:12] you we are happy with you but you don't
[55:14] seem to be happy for these Clean Hands
[55:17] you you are happy but yeah yeah
[55:20] what's wrong with you do you still have
[55:23] a bit do you still need some more some
[55:25] more javela you know javel
[55:29] bleach
[55:30] you still need some more bleach and a
[55:33] full full cycle
[55:36] he
[55:38] our outside must show that you are
[55:40] another right you are a clean cleaned
[55:43] person by the blood bleaching blood of
[55:45] our Lord Jesus Christ that we are now a
[55:48] clean person and that is owed all to the
[55:52] Lord Jesus
[55:54] now
[55:57] let us let's just talk about total
[56:00] separation
[56:02] the pastor I don't know if any of you
[56:03] have managed to listen to that same one
[56:05] how many of you have listened to that
[56:07] one
[56:08] total separation
[56:11] now
[56:12] let's take that thought eh
[56:14] let's take the thought of Leaning
[56:17] learning how to separate from unbelief
[56:20] because it is that separation that
[56:23] actually brings us to the full
[56:24] manifestation of this
[56:27] right now God had one way of bringing
[56:32] light to you that's when you are ready
[56:35] to separate
[56:36] that's the only way
[56:38] that's the only way when God is going to
[56:40] shine on you and bring his light upon
[56:43] you and you become a moving light only
[56:46] when you are ready to separate
[56:49] until then full manifestation of the
[56:51] light of God may not be able to be on
[56:53] you and indwell in you fully
[56:56] because you are not able to you are not
[56:58] willing to to separate sorry I have to
[57:00] stand here a bit just to be close to you
[57:02] as well and I can also see
[57:05] now you you you you think you think of
[57:08] the holy spirit is separator
[57:11] the holy spirit is a cutter it's a
[57:14] separator
[57:16] there's a scripture that says how can
[57:17] you save God and Mormon at the same time
[57:19] I'm not saying you do brothers and
[57:21] sisters what I'm trying to do they're
[57:24] ineffective when they produce
[57:26] when they make these things back
[57:29] say say this thing
[57:32] is called a what a stent a mic stand
[57:35] ineffective when they make it
[57:38] profess my girl it's a process of making
[57:41] taking every part of this perfect
[57:45] and that process they make it and they
[57:48] produce it some will make the rubber
[57:49] some will make this bold some will make
[57:52] this and everything and the inside of it
[57:54] and the painting
[57:56] when it gets to the end of the
[57:58] production line
[58:00] at the end where they say now it's ready
[58:02] to be packaged there's a guy called your
[58:04] quality Ashura
[58:05] he that guy is doing a quality assurance
[58:09] I've got a little machine maybe or
[58:11] inside a little room where it's got a
[58:14] light red green
[58:16] test it and they test it and they check
[58:19] it and they do quality assurance
[58:22] the moment the red the light goes green
[58:25] that is good he puts a sticker
[58:29] party pass T pass now the moment it goes
[58:34] red not ready they check oh the fold is
[58:36] there they didn't paint it red one side
[58:39] it does not go with those ones are we
[58:41] together and that's the process which me
[58:43] and you are now
[58:45] God is doing the final checking up
[58:49] the final checking up it means
[58:53] we are just at the end of the end
[58:56] so if we just be alert and know that we
[58:59] are now at the process where we are
[59:00] moving out now but then he can tell you
[59:03] they just came now I'm sure when they
[59:04] check in there in South Africa in taking
[59:07] into the Customs there you know
[59:10] a night before maybe they checked their
[59:12] bags and everything is right and they
[59:14] get to the airport they still check the
[59:15] board what is allowed there was not
[59:17] allowed what's the kilogram and then
[59:20] maybe they take their kilogram both of
[59:22] them they'll combine it it is 20
[59:23] kilograms 20 per person then they check
[59:26] that Opera the business code 14 then I
[59:28] can take 20 I can take more you know you
[59:30] balance it off the weight and everything
[59:32] your quality because once you go in
[59:35] there
[59:37] there's no more checking
[59:39] no no there's no more checking
[59:42] excuse me the first question they ask
[59:44] you is this your big set did you pick it
[59:46] yourself yeah
[59:47] you say yes you know everything that is
[59:49] inside here yes
[59:51] are you sure said yes okay
[59:53] then they open
[59:54] then they find a big bag of coffee
[1:00:00] 20 kilogram
[1:00:02] sir is this your coffee yes okay please
[1:00:05] just stand there
[1:00:06] then they open
[1:00:08] from that time then they're going to
[1:00:10] check everything about you
[1:00:12] they'll take you in their ears they'll
[1:00:14] check you everywhere
[1:00:16] this is quality assurance
[1:00:18] their quality because every product that
[1:00:21] goes through there must be checked
[1:00:23] quality perfect heaven is a clean clean
[1:00:27] place
[1:00:29] and therefore me and you cannot afford
[1:00:32] to have these little things that are
[1:00:34] called the man of God calls them loose
[1:00:37] ends
[1:00:38] we have got no sins among us nothing we
[1:00:43] look good and we don't deliberately go
[1:00:45] and do a sin and say I'm gonna sing
[1:00:47] today then I'll go to church tomorrow
[1:00:49] they'll pray for me no no we don't do
[1:00:50] that the devil is so subtle
[1:00:53] he said to Eve
[1:00:57] you know
[1:00:59] he says hi sister
[1:01:02] no
[1:01:03] it's all right
[1:01:04] he says to you he wants surely not
[1:01:08] surely
[1:01:09] that's how he comes and attack us today
[1:01:12] he doesn't come and say smoke here no no
[1:01:15] no go and sweat that person today to a
[1:01:17] Believer to ask he come in a certain way
[1:01:19] because the first Eve failed
[1:01:23] now we are the second if
[1:01:25] and this if it's not going to fail what
[1:01:28] I'm alerting you is what he's trying to
[1:01:31] do he's repeating himself just like he
[1:01:34] did to the first Eve
[1:01:35] he'll bring things that you are not
[1:01:37] aware
[1:01:38] things that are easily ignorable brother
[1:01:41] negligible we say things that are so
[1:01:45] easy things that you kiss ah no no no no
[1:01:47] no no that's that's okay that's just my
[1:01:49] that's just a baby
[1:01:51] yeah no no no no no no no that's just a
[1:01:54] little boy
[1:01:56] that's just a small child knowing very
[1:01:58] well that he has is a small child I
[1:02:01] agree but he wants to plant something to
[1:02:04] bring in the back door in my house
[1:02:07] that's just a young boy
[1:02:09] the a young boy
[1:02:11] but how come Manoa
[1:02:14] and his wife the Bible the angel said
[1:02:17] hey even before they were born don't
[1:02:19] drink wine how come
[1:02:21] how come John the Baptist how come he
[1:02:24] got the Holy Spirit even before he was
[1:02:27] born
[1:02:27] ah I said to my kids hey I am your Holy
[1:02:31] Spirit if you haven't got it until you
[1:02:33] get yours
[1:02:35] so listen to me
[1:02:37] I'm your Holy Spirit until you get your
[1:02:39] Holy Spirit right so listen to me
[1:02:41] because I've got I've got the holy
[1:02:42] spirit so listen to me you won't go
[1:02:44] wrong
[1:02:45] and it mustn't be
[1:02:52] to read the seven Church ages you go and
[1:02:54] take that book it's so lovely even you
[1:02:56] read it and it's so lovely but when it
[1:02:58] comes to loudishia if the prophet says
[1:03:01] the city of laodicia has certain
[1:03:03] characteristics
[1:03:04] had certain certain you know features it
[1:03:09] was a city of freedom
[1:03:11] it was a city of high economic success
[1:03:13] of prosperity it was even called a Metro
[1:03:16] Police a metro police in those days it
[1:03:20] was a prosperous City it was a city
[1:03:22] where the all the other cities gathered
[1:03:24] to come
[1:03:25] and do rituals every year it was a
[1:03:28] successful City but women were very read
[1:03:31] that the people were free whenever it
[1:03:35] was a city of leave us alone
[1:03:39] leave me alone
[1:03:41] huh did you know that it is Iniquity
[1:03:45] for you to see your brother doing
[1:03:48] something wrong and not tell him
[1:03:53] because you you actually become part of
[1:03:55] that wrongness God will count it on you
[1:03:58] if you see me doing something wrong or
[1:04:00] see
[1:04:01] Becca and not tell her and not say the
[1:04:04] key is to do it with the right spirit
[1:04:08] that's the key but not to do it seeing
[1:04:11] that Becca is going in the fire and I'm
[1:04:13] going the reptile my daughter's going
[1:04:14] there and I don't tell her God is gonna
[1:04:17] count it
[1:04:18] against you
[1:04:19] that is why it's not nice to be
[1:04:21] corrected
[1:04:23] that is why it's not nice
[1:04:25] it's not nice the prophets say we cannot
[1:04:27] see Billy the train is coming there and
[1:04:29] Billy's playing on the railroad you say
[1:04:31] hey Billy boy boy
[1:04:33] get out of the railroad Billy boy
[1:04:36] yeah
[1:04:39] be careful as any boy I told you before
[1:04:43] the train is coming fast
[1:04:46] what do you say
[1:04:50] and you snatch him out I'm not saying be
[1:04:54] angry to your children I'm simply saying
[1:04:57] particularly the First World countries
[1:04:59] that have observed
[1:05:03] there is too much
[1:05:05] we are in need of nothing spirit
[1:05:08] and that enables this it sort of hampers
[1:05:13] the spirit of God to move freely
[1:05:16] to correct and to chastise
[1:05:19] you find that you cannot touch a child
[1:05:21] if I touch Jonah or even mama and lady
[1:05:24] will not know the police first 9-1-1
[1:05:26] what is it triple one
[1:05:30] instead of Jonah say no no no Uncle come
[1:05:33] here man come let's go why why why are
[1:05:35] you giving me a backsla why
[1:05:37] I love you Jonah
[1:05:40] it's because Uncle Paul loves you
[1:05:44] come let's talk it over I'm so sorry
[1:05:46] that I've hurt you but you know my boy
[1:05:48] you see the spirit I'm coming with
[1:05:51] you see that's the spirit but just to to
[1:05:54] let the things go in the name of what
[1:05:57] the government says don't touch the
[1:05:59] children whose children are they is God
[1:06:01] going to ask a
[1:06:04] the government
[1:06:05] about Ruben and Liam is God going to ask
[1:06:08] the government and say government tell
[1:06:10] me now what happened
[1:06:11] is not going to ask God is not God is
[1:06:14] going to ask importance happy and say
[1:06:16] hey
[1:06:23] accepted it
[1:06:26] he can say that
[1:06:28] because I didn't teach him well
[1:06:30] I didn't tell him when I saw him do
[1:06:32] something wrong
[1:06:33] rather
[1:06:37] be in the bad books of your brother
[1:06:41] but you have told him the truth
[1:06:44] in the right Spirit let's notify our way
[1:06:48] as we finish this year let's jump into
[1:06:50] the new year ready to cut
[1:06:54] those loose ends to cut those small
[1:06:57] things that so easily beset us that come
[1:07:00] unaware this is the secret of how you're
[1:07:03] going to see that there are some loose
[1:07:05] and somewhere here
[1:07:07] what is his name
[1:07:12] there's some loose ends let me give you
[1:07:14] a tip this is the way to see it
[1:07:17] the moment you find out you are not
[1:07:18] reading the weight as you're supposed to
[1:07:21] the moment you realize that your love
[1:07:22] your affection your excitement you are
[1:07:24] still for God is reducing
[1:07:28] you know yourself the moment you find
[1:07:30] out the way you read the word of God and
[1:07:32] he actually consumed not just to read it
[1:07:34] for the sake of reading it reading it to
[1:07:36] eat to consume it the moment you find
[1:07:38] out you are too busy for God
[1:07:41] huh
[1:07:43] it's tattoo
[1:07:46] bring a scissor the big one
[1:07:48] check check those loose ends oh you'll
[1:07:51] find them hiding and you can't
[1:07:53] then a bubble of Holy Ghost filled
[1:07:57] excitement just move
[1:08:00] after cutting that loose end then you go
[1:08:03] and say ah why am I'm this side I'm
[1:08:05] walking straight away I'm sick then you
[1:08:07] check check yourself the Bible says
[1:08:10] let's check ourselves using this Bible
[1:08:12] with the weight and check ourselves it
[1:08:15] is better for us to be chastised and
[1:08:17] reprimanded now
[1:08:20] than to miss the rapture
[1:08:22] because of one small little loose end
[1:08:24] then to miss the meeting I was thinking
[1:08:26] yesterday I felt so happy man I said I I
[1:08:30] felt so I wanted to jump because I was
[1:08:33] thinking about the day that morning when
[1:08:36] when we go home when we change brothers
[1:08:38] and sisters that morning when we go when
[1:08:41] when it's over and finish
[1:08:42] do you ever take time just to think
[1:08:44] about that just to think about what's
[1:08:46] going to happen the day they say it's
[1:08:48] over you know I'll throw my laptop very
[1:08:50] far
[1:08:51] foreign
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:57] probably I won't have time for such
[1:08:59] things I'll just go
[1:09:01] I'll probably just kick it one more time
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:05] because brother and sister let me tell
[1:09:07] you this many times the devil brings
[1:09:09] this membrane of covering you know what
[1:09:12] we are supposed to be exploding into you
[1:09:16] know exploding into that excitement the
[1:09:17] Zeal of actually realizing that there's
[1:09:20] top priority and everything else comes
[1:09:22] second the devil covers it particularly
[1:09:25] on the young people I know that because
[1:09:27] I was a young person he's got an ability
[1:09:29] on a young person to make you feel that
[1:09:32] you can do anything
[1:09:33] and you're able and you need nobody
[1:09:35] because of course you are strong you are
[1:09:38] clever you are sharp man
[1:09:40] but he doesn't tell you that hey man you
[1:09:43] only have one underwear
[1:09:45] one and your father bought you
[1:09:48] and you've got two maybe vests
[1:09:51] and you've got one or three pair of
[1:09:53] shoes
[1:09:54] who you didn't buy
[1:09:58] your dad bought them for you Daniel
[1:10:01] hey
[1:10:02] that you are dead bought them for you
[1:10:05] but the devil doesn't the devil says
[1:10:10] you are
[1:10:12] of course you are a young lion
[1:10:15] but David said
[1:10:17] kingdom of God while you are in that age
[1:10:19] why you are so strong because hey all of
[1:10:21] us are coming to your age when we change
[1:10:23] that morning I'm gonna be just like Kira
[1:10:26] taller maybe than him
[1:10:28] you see now he's taller than me and he
[1:10:31] said Dad come I wanna I wanna talk to
[1:10:32] you you just stand next to me I said
[1:10:34] what he says no no that's all this guy
[1:10:38] don't do that so but now
[1:10:41] there's gonna come a time when our going
[1:10:43] to change
[1:10:44] imagine we are all all the same age
[1:10:46] imagine imagine we are changing that
[1:10:48] morning you're gonna cry a cry that we
[1:10:51] have never cried before that morning
[1:10:53] you're going to realize that
[1:10:57] so what are all these things among us
[1:11:01] that disturbs us the small little things
[1:11:04] that we are not even supposed to worry
[1:11:06] about sisters no
[1:11:10] nowadays were even becoming like sisters
[1:11:13] oh Jesus help us Lord
[1:11:16] ah help us Lord we are supposed when we
[1:11:20] think of our going
[1:11:21] amen
[1:11:23] forgiveness comes like a Mighty rushing
[1:11:26] wind to my brother
[1:11:27] covers him up before he even asks me I
[1:11:30] just love him
[1:11:31] that's that love to be
[1:11:34] bred both sides I told you the story
[1:11:37] you forgot
[1:11:39] you you you love and forgive your
[1:11:42] brother so much so
[1:11:44] that no devil is going to DARE come to
[1:11:46] you to say ah that sister
[1:11:49] never you won't take a chance because
[1:11:51] the amount of you've cut all the loose
[1:11:54] ends are activated further away from
[1:11:57] what I wanted to talk about
[1:11:58] but anyway now
[1:12:01] do you ever see people like that he's
[1:12:03] talking about Ahab
[1:12:04] was a make-believer aha was an
[1:12:07] unbeliever you know he he just do right
[1:12:10] they they feel like they just make
[1:12:12] better social person when they go to
[1:12:14] church they just want to have their
[1:12:15] social life and maybe you know for the
[1:12:18] sake of the children they will just go
[1:12:19] to church you know we just say a social
[1:12:21] group
[1:12:22] this is not a social group
[1:12:26] we are not in a social group
[1:12:28] it's important for us to be correctable
[1:12:32] if you are correctable if corrects me
[1:12:35] and I'm correctable I stand much a
[1:12:37] better chance to listen to God
[1:12:41] if your brother corrects you the one
[1:12:43] that you can see and talk to him and
[1:12:44] negotiate
[1:12:45] and he said no I didn't mean to him and
[1:12:46] Brother Andy please come home my friend
[1:12:49] the one you can talk to if you can
[1:12:51] listen to him correcting you how are you
[1:12:53] going to listen to God
[1:12:58] so
[1:12:59] I'll go to the next slide
[1:13:03] oh yeah sorry I can't jump this one
[1:13:04] let's go to the middle there you see in
[1:13:06] the middle Alice let's go from beginning
[1:13:09] it's a total separation we are not we
[1:13:12] are not to go back into the world no
[1:13:14] more and have anything to do with the
[1:13:17] world but live only unto God Jesus is
[1:13:20] coming after the bride a bride a woman a
[1:13:23] church that is separated from the things
[1:13:26] of the world
[1:13:29] things of the world and their appearance
[1:13:33] the Bible says in Thessalonians I can't
[1:13:35] remember first Thessalonians it says run
[1:13:38] away from the very appearance of sin
[1:13:41] let alone sin appearance only
[1:13:45] stand away from it
[1:13:47] what's up what's after your brother
[1:13:49] what's up to your sister they wash him
[1:13:50] over you just appearance say hey my
[1:13:53] friend first pray for them and from your
[1:13:56] heart cry for them and go talk to them
[1:13:58] if you see anything wrong as we move
[1:14:00] into 2023
[1:14:01] let it be our team that will be that
[1:14:05] wife
[1:14:06] that he's coming for she's separated
[1:14:09] from the cares of the traditions of the
[1:14:11] church not tradition must bind us we
[1:14:13] have been so much in the traditions in
[1:14:15] the message
[1:14:17] Traditions I was talking to my wife the
[1:14:19] other day and we were talking about
[1:14:21] music you know when we grew up if you
[1:14:23] play those brothers that you were with
[1:14:25] those Elders when we grew up just to
[1:14:28] play a gospel song you that's needed
[1:14:31] sorry I almost hit
[1:14:34] so those are the Traditions all of us
[1:14:37] came with them and the Bible says when
[1:14:41] they came out of Egypt the mixed malt
[1:14:43] issues came with them when we kept the
[1:14:46] message mixed small tissues of spirits
[1:14:48] came with us and then we see as long as
[1:14:51] we go along we kill them but brother Ben
[1:14:54] said you know as Men of Valor just
[1:14:55] killed him because we are made to kill
[1:14:57] Giants we are made please to devour
[1:14:59] Giants
[1:15:01] you know to devour it's not just to chew
[1:15:03] you devour it
[1:15:05] so that's what we are made to do so let
[1:15:07] us be aware that as we go along you can
[1:15:09] find a great man of Valor who destroyed
[1:15:12] Giants but his body is working like this
[1:15:14] huh straight
[1:15:17] spinal caught everything straight
[1:15:19] because he's a great man of Valor no
[1:15:22] Loose Ends no disabling from the air
[1:15:26] from the enemy disabling of any part of
[1:15:28] your body spiritual body by the devil
[1:15:31] and it is my job my job your job to take
[1:15:34] it that ah I don't I give priority to my
[1:15:38] man
[1:15:39] the Lord Jesus Christ every day of my
[1:15:42] life because in the yellow part he is
[1:15:45] separated from the Fashions of them of
[1:15:47] this Modern Age that will that we will
[1:15:50] live in
[1:15:51] she's separated from the case or and the
[1:15:54] traditions of the churches
[1:15:57] now does her identification
[1:16:00] that's her NASA right identification to
[1:16:03] be separated to be completely and
[1:16:06] checked snipping anything that along the
[1:16:09] way you know is this Christmas does not
[1:16:12] wrong to come to a point and with the
[1:16:14] children say hey guys come let's sit
[1:16:15] down this man how did we do tell me how
[1:16:18] let's take stock of each each other yeah
[1:16:21] not only start to talk when there's a
[1:16:23] problem
[1:16:23] [Laughter]
[1:16:26] so may God help us let's finish up with
[1:16:30] this I think
[1:16:31] I think my time
[1:16:33] unless somebody says to me
[1:16:36] go on
[1:16:38] amen let's read there and see hear what
[1:16:41] the prophet says in the book of
[1:16:44] um God's word calls for total separation
[1:16:46] I believe tonight that every man and
[1:16:49] woman every boy or girl that's born of
[1:16:51] the spirit of God is another right
[1:16:54] are you another right
[1:16:56] another right is someone who is
[1:16:58] separated and that's what we are whether
[1:17:02] the devil takes it or not let him
[1:17:04] swallow it that's what we are and you
[1:17:06] are going to be another right whether
[1:17:08] the devil likes it or not why did the
[1:17:11] Lord Jesus Christ said to Peter get thee
[1:17:14] behind me Satan I always I'm always
[1:17:16] intrigued by this statement why did the
[1:17:19] Lord say it that way that was too harsh
[1:17:20] isn't it in the physical way of seeing
[1:17:23] things it was too high sister in us to
[1:17:25] say you know I come to you let's say I
[1:17:28] come to my sister say oh God bless you
[1:17:30] my sister God bless you oh sister no no
[1:17:31] don't do it this way dude get thee
[1:17:34] behind me Satan oh my God huh just
[1:17:37] imagine how I feel
[1:17:38] ah
[1:17:39] I wanted you to go towards the Cuban
[1:17:43] hey
[1:17:44] you know I said you'll get me in the car
[1:17:49] I wonder if that imagine if someone do
[1:17:51] that to you but why did the Lord do that
[1:17:53] to him
[1:17:55] I watched the patient The Passion of the
[1:17:58] Christ the other day
[1:17:59] man
[1:18:00] that is it Gibson okay they made it so
[1:18:04] so so really
[1:18:05] it's painfully
[1:18:07] and when I think that actually he was
[1:18:09] naked the Lord Jesus Christ you know in
[1:18:12] some books historical books he says you
[1:18:14] know even the prophet I think said it he
[1:18:17] said
[1:18:18] they beat him that you could see the
[1:18:19] riffs the bones
[1:18:22] that's how they beat him and they beat
[1:18:24] him
[1:18:25] but yet the same man when when when
[1:18:28] Peter cut the ear he
[1:18:30] reprimanded Peter must have thought this
[1:18:33] man is not okay
[1:18:35] he picks up that ear and then he plugs
[1:18:38] it back and he reprimand him
[1:18:41] huh
[1:18:42] so
[1:18:45] I want to say to you brother and sister
[1:18:47] we are from a higher Kingdom
[1:18:49] en and a higher kingdom is even an
[1:18:51] understatement if we can only realize
[1:18:54] who we are right now
[1:18:56] I'm telling you I'm telling you
[1:18:59] we we we will change we will change we
[1:19:03] will go home we will ignite everyone
[1:19:06] around us and our near churches and
[1:19:08] everyone who will ignite them just one
[1:19:10] light of match
[1:19:14] just by realizing his full potential and
[1:19:17] lighten up I'm telling you something
[1:19:19] that we have never seen will happen you
[1:19:22] will bring the Rapture closer here
[1:19:24] we just realize Who We Are
[1:19:26] and make accept
[1:19:29] who we were
[1:19:30] and accept who we are I'm telling you by
[1:19:34] removing those loose ends listen to that
[1:19:36] Jesus has constantly told us that there
[1:19:40] is a separation
[1:19:41] and we find that the last thing that
[1:19:44] that's predicted to the human race
[1:19:46] before the great final day when we
[1:19:49] Ascend into the presence of God there is
[1:19:52] a final separation
[1:19:55] not one
[1:19:56] the standard separation when I'm finally
[1:19:59] separated because
[1:20:00] because of Separation you know in the
[1:20:02] beginning he said let there be light and
[1:20:04] then it was light why because before
[1:20:06] light it was inside Darkness mixed up
[1:20:08] together and the god separated
[1:20:11] cut it in the very beginning
[1:20:14] and Adam God made him and gave him him
[1:20:17] and then from there Satan come in and
[1:20:19] what did God do separate them out of the
[1:20:22] garden he's the god of separation and he
[1:20:24] said to them I'm coming again to bring
[1:20:27] the one who's going to bring you where
[1:20:29] you were brother Ben was talking about
[1:20:32] it how many listens to those those clips
[1:20:34] man I I wish they gave us a full same
[1:20:36] one
[1:20:37] because there was there's a plan here
[1:20:39] there's a plan and that plan is for you
[1:20:41] and for me don't underestimate yourself
[1:20:43] you are a big man you are a big woman
[1:20:46] today you you are a big the prime
[1:20:48] ministers of this world don't know who
[1:20:50] they're dealing with that's you
[1:20:53] and the sooner you see that you are
[1:20:55] those hence Clean Hands
[1:20:57] and look where you coming from
[1:20:59] man
[1:21:01] nothing is going to stop you
[1:21:03] he will still come in time when you're
[1:21:05] going to ship is going to be separated
[1:21:06] from
[1:21:09] but the only credential that a Believer
[1:21:11] has in the word of God is living in him
[1:21:14] declaring Jesus Christ lives in that
[1:21:16] person that's the separated Nazarite
[1:21:19] unto the Lord separated for the word
[1:21:22] sake
[1:21:23] that is why when they call you a stupid
[1:21:25] when they call you ugly when they call
[1:21:27] you like the long dresses when they call
[1:21:29] you funny and all sorts of things you
[1:21:31] must be very happy
[1:21:33] you must be very excited and see yes you
[1:21:36] have finally saw who I am I'm an oddball
[1:21:39] very happy
[1:21:41] at work I just purposefully pray for the
[1:21:43] food purposefully
[1:21:46] I just I when they're talking talking
[1:21:47] and I want to eat I just
[1:21:50] and I pray
[1:21:51] because they're looking then I pray
[1:21:54] heavenly father thank you for your food
[1:21:56] today
[1:21:57] bless my colleagues here
[1:22:00] then they must ask me who's this God
[1:22:02] that you are praying then it's a chance
[1:22:03] for me to tell them maybe there's a
[1:22:05] Nazarite somewhere among them there
[1:22:07] for me to find him Jesus has constantly
[1:22:09] told us okay I've read that one for you
[1:22:12] it's a final separation that is coming
[1:22:13] which is the final Rapture that is going
[1:22:15] to take us home that reptile is the
[1:22:18] reality is the truth it's called it's
[1:22:20] not like the news of BBC no no it's a
[1:22:23] real live news of what's going to happen
[1:22:26] it's going to take place one day and
[1:22:28] that time when it happens
[1:22:29] when it happens make sure
[1:22:33] that it takes you make very sure be very
[1:22:36] sure because that time there is no more
[1:22:38] turning back
[1:22:40] every witch every bad person the time
[1:22:44] will be done they can do what they want
[1:22:46] now
[1:22:47] The Killers can kill the wishes can be
[1:22:50] weak whoever those who don't want to
[1:22:52] pray the Bible says continue and not
[1:22:54] pray
[1:22:55] continue
[1:22:58] let those that are good
[1:23:00] continue to be good
[1:23:02] and you do your best and continue to be
[1:23:05] good before the Lord and saving
[1:23:08] lastly
[1:23:09] I think I must jump this one oh yeah
[1:23:12] then this is the last one then because
[1:23:13] my conclusion is empty it was because of
[1:23:16] that accident
[1:23:17] now let's just read this one because
[1:23:19] we've got just a few minutes let's just
[1:23:21] enjoy maybe I said dessert
[1:23:23] the question is
[1:23:25] to the people today does does he really
[1:23:28] mean it
[1:23:30] what brother and Paul is saying
[1:23:32] does it mean that there's going to be
[1:23:35] one day a change of bodies
[1:23:38] brother and says I mean it
[1:23:40] let me rather die today Lord if you know
[1:23:43] tomorrow I'm going to backslide take me
[1:23:45] today
[1:23:48] that's how hard it is that how real it
[1:23:50] is like just Lord take me if tomorrow
[1:23:54] I'm not going to save you the way
[1:23:57] I'd rather go home
[1:24:00] does he really mean it and when you
[1:24:02] accept what the church says do does he
[1:24:04] really mean it you see what happens when
[1:24:07] you ask such kind of statements then you
[1:24:10] put yourself in some condition that Adam
[1:24:12] did
[1:24:14] because Adam purposely went with Eve and
[1:24:17] said ah
[1:24:19] you know enjoying yourself into the the
[1:24:22] woman of the Church of this world and
[1:24:24] separate yourself from the blessing of
[1:24:26] God that has promised in other ways if
[1:24:29] you don't see parade yourself from the
[1:24:31] things of the world you are actually
[1:24:33] separating yourself from God
[1:24:37] does it make sense
[1:24:39] now blessing that God has promised to
[1:24:42] every believer that will separate
[1:24:44] himself from the world
[1:24:46] to the wage
[1:24:47] now that's the truth
[1:24:51] separate yourself I separate myself
[1:24:54] because we are Nazarite and if we don't
[1:24:58] we are separating ourselves from God
[1:25:01] how said that when you are already in
[1:25:04] when you are already in
[1:25:06] when all you need to do is just a few
[1:25:08] little remaining sacrifices
[1:25:12] and we go home
[1:25:16] just to listen to my men dead everything
[1:25:18] they say
[1:25:19] then you might eat how beautiful that is
[1:25:22] there maybe the Rapture will come even
[1:25:24] before you 10 18. who knows maybe it'll
[1:25:27] come
[1:25:28] and then we go then voila you are a tall
[1:25:31] girl
[1:25:33] isn't that a lovely thing we say it so
[1:25:35] nicely and so so light but that's the
[1:25:38] truth
[1:25:39] that's the truth like when I say these
[1:25:41] brothers are from South Africa it's the
[1:25:42] truth more than that
[1:25:44] so I would like us to think about this
[1:25:47] message and maybe go read it as the
[1:25:49] pastor send it you will find things in
[1:25:51] there that are quite challenging
[1:25:53] that you know where the Prophet you know
[1:25:55] I don't know if it's this message or
[1:25:57] another one where the Prophet said hey
[1:25:58] this loose ends up the devil has
[1:26:00] realized that there's nothing he can do
[1:26:03] on us the strategy his strategy is just
[1:26:06] a delaying tactics
[1:26:08] his strategy is the Loose Ends the
[1:26:10] things that you know you you do this but
[1:26:12] actually there's nothing yeah
[1:26:13] you know he just you just feel like
[1:26:16] screen oh if you just leave it
[1:26:19] sometimes I get itchy and I say I'm not
[1:26:21] going to scratch myself
[1:26:24] and after after a few seconds I don't
[1:26:26] feel easy
[1:26:27] because that's how the devil Works he
[1:26:29] wants to distract your attention he
[1:26:32] wants to bring a loose ends while you
[1:26:33] are looking the scripture thinking that
[1:26:35] no then you just start swelling you
[1:26:36] believe it
[1:26:37] that's how the devil Works young
[1:26:39] children wake up
[1:26:41] wake up and take the word of God
[1:26:43] seriously
[1:26:44] right know that his brother Ben said
[1:26:47] there's a part of you physically that is
[1:26:49] not fully grown so the elders listen to
[1:26:52] them and then you held us let's not just
[1:26:55] make it a talk for them let us make it a
[1:26:59] living a life
[1:27:00] it's better to ask for us to live it
[1:27:03] than to say it
[1:27:05] that's the best way because children
[1:27:06] learn by observing
[1:27:08] young people learn by watching
[1:27:11] they just watch you beating your wife
[1:27:13] then they get married they beat their
[1:27:15] wives
[1:27:16] they learn well that's them how a human
[1:27:18] being is made they just watch you
[1:27:20] shouting and being upset
[1:27:23] for no reason tomorrow morning is still
[1:27:25] upset ah
[1:27:27] the Bible said Don't Let the Sun Go Down
[1:27:31] so you don't even allow it to go you
[1:27:33] allow it to rise you are still
[1:27:37] we mustn't do that Brothers Let's
[1:27:40] challenge ourselves and say hey me I'm
[1:27:43] gonna be happy when I'm upset and
[1:27:45] everything I'm gonna say honey I love
[1:27:46] you
[1:27:49] I love you I wipe my tears and I love
[1:27:51] you because I'm upset and I smile Ah
[1:27:56] that's what we must do
[1:27:58] we must make them fearful brothers and
[1:28:00] say this oh hey if your father comes
[1:28:03] here
[1:28:05] let's not do that Brothers brothers
[1:28:07] let's not do that no I don't talk like
[1:28:11] brother brother Jonah said no we just I
[1:28:14] don't want to talk
[1:28:16] you don't know how to talk
[1:28:18] that's the devil
[1:28:20] so God help us as brothers God help us
[1:28:23] as the mothers
[1:28:25] you've got a very important role young
[1:28:27] people let's hold the fort together it's
[1:28:30] just a little bit more left
[1:28:33] more left just a little bit more left
[1:28:36] and I'm telling you that day when you
[1:28:39] change you want to be changed
[1:28:41] you want to go home because it's going
[1:28:43] to be I was talking to my wife
[1:28:46] I think it was one of the days from
[1:28:47] these holidays I said ah you know that
[1:28:49] morning when the revenue is going to be
[1:28:50] a simple day like this one
[1:28:52] it was a nice day
[1:28:54] cloudless
[1:28:56] you know they say day when the day comes
[1:28:58] and you just feel good you just look at
[1:29:00] the day and you just feel you I feel
[1:29:02] good about today
[1:29:04] the day is coming I haven't eaten a
[1:29:06] breakfast maybe I haven't done nothing I
[1:29:07] just walk outside and you just feel good
[1:29:09] doesn't it happen to you Mama and you

[1:29:18] just hear the neighbor starting your car
[1:29:20] and if you are there by the my limbs you
[1:29:22] just hear the waves going
[1:29:24] like normal then you feel a car passing
[1:29:27] you know it's gonna be a normal day a
[1:29:30] normal day where ND wakes up and want to
[1:29:31] make coffee you know it's gonna be a
[1:29:34] simple day a simple normal day and any
[1:29:37] rise I will wake up at six o'clock and
[1:29:39] the wakes up and start his car and
[1:29:41] drinks his coffee you know he likes to
[1:29:43] get his things structured brother and
[1:29:45] then it's gonna be a day like that
[1:29:46] gonna be a simple day like that where
[1:29:49] you wake up Tiana and you want to go
[1:29:51] what did I say I want to do for the
[1:29:53] Sunday School oh yeah oh yes then you
[1:29:55] want your computer a simple day like
[1:29:57] that that's how it's gonna be when Adam
[1:29:59] I'm just gonna wake up and think that oh
[1:30:00] I must go yes today I'm traveling there
[1:30:03] there
[1:30:05] flies and everything could it be a day
[1:30:07] like that it's gonna be a simple day
[1:30:08] like that where you think David today
[1:30:10] I'm gonna finish that job oh yesterday
[1:30:12] the Lord was with me and you wake up and
[1:30:14] before you go and you just you just
[1:30:17] you know only been a chance to feel
[1:30:19] strange
[1:30:21] you're just gonna change
[1:30:23] it's gonna be a day just like that where
[1:30:25] you wake up and you think you're going
[1:30:26] to write the exam or submit your
[1:30:28] assignment you're too late you're
[1:30:29] changed
[1:30:32] it's gonna be a day like that it's gonna
[1:30:34] be a day like that
[1:30:36] so it's worth it all that we check every
[1:30:39] aspect of Our Lives
[1:30:40] I'm done now
[1:30:42] Jesus you have to encourage you to say
[1:30:44] it's important for us to separate
[1:30:47] it's important for us to honor that
[1:30:50] Nazarite identity of Who We Are and if
[1:30:54] you don't honor it
[1:30:56] do your best go and cry on your knees
[1:30:59] before God God it's never too late with
[1:31:01] the Lord
[1:31:03] and I'm preaching this to myself
[1:31:04] everything that I said here is to myself
[1:31:06] too
[1:31:07] is directed to me
[1:31:09] if I say you
[1:31:11] you and you these three fingers are
[1:31:14] pointing at me
[1:31:16] so I'm saying this with a clear
[1:31:19] conscious
[1:31:20] clear mindset to know that heimple
[1:31:24] that's also for you
[1:31:25] I'm not just making it hard for you and
[1:31:28] I want to make it hard for myself
[1:31:30] because it's better for it to be hard
[1:31:32] for me now
[1:31:33] and jump in the rapture
[1:31:35] and go
[1:31:37] may the Lord bless you
[1:31:38] may the Lord shine upon you and your
[1:31:41] families in your life in your journey
[1:31:44] may he prepare you
[1:31:46] because he's a perfect God and can I
[1:31:49] tell you what
[1:31:50] we all just think that I'm saying go do
[1:31:52] them and do them once you just open and
[1:31:54] give your heart he'll do it for you
[1:31:56] it's gonna do it for you
[1:31:58] that's why he came to die at the cross
[1:32:01] to show you that hey I'll be with you
[1:32:03] even unto the very end of the world all
[1:32:05] he needs is your positive mind your
[1:32:07] positive attitude
[1:32:09] you're just gonna wake up and you see
[1:32:10] Danny he's bigger is the same as you and
[1:32:13] you look at yourself I've changed also
[1:32:15] hold we are going
[1:32:19] maybe this is South Africa at that time
[1:32:21] he says hey and one what's happening
[1:32:24] there no no we're
[1:32:26] that time
[1:32:27] my friend I don't know how fast you're
[1:32:29] going to run over
[1:32:32] I'm telling you it's gonna be a time
[1:32:35] like never before
[1:32:37] that's why it's worth emphasizing on it
[1:32:40] to us ourselves our wives our husbands
[1:32:43] and our children
[1:32:45] and all our beloved ones
[1:32:47] you you you've got no time not to
[1:32:49] forgive anyone
[1:32:51] oh
[1:32:52] time of a grudge you've got no time
[1:32:54] those things are for the devil not for
[1:32:56] me not for you time for me to think that
[1:32:58] you don't like me I've got no time for
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] I've got no time for that I know Jesus
[1:33:03] likes me and I like you that's it
[1:33:06] so so Jesus Christ has got no time for
[1:33:09] Peter cutting of the ear please those
[1:33:11] are worthy things
[1:33:15] that's why he's reprimanding Peter wake
[1:33:17] up man
[1:33:18] don't you see it's not it's the general
[1:33:20] day that's trying to make you do that
[1:33:22] wake up I like Peter Peter I like him
[1:33:25] very much we'll talk about Peter there's
[1:33:27] someone to be Peter one day
[1:33:28] I mean that guy I like him
[1:33:31] uh I think I'm like him
[1:33:35] because he was he was a good getterman
[1:33:38] he just got himself into trouble many
[1:33:40] times and and I'm like
[1:33:42] I just walk on water then I then I think
[1:33:46] oh then the Lord said come on you have
[1:33:48] little faith
[1:33:49] I I I'm like that I go fast so may God
[1:33:52] help us to be like Peter
[1:33:55] we may not all be like Peter but let's
[1:33:57] find a character like ourselves
[1:34:00] let's sing a beautiful song that says
[1:34:03] into thy presence we come
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:07] [Applause]
[1:34:10] you know assistant one into their
[1:34:12] presence we come
[1:34:13] not not by The Works that I've done
[1:34:16] but by your grace and your grace alone
[1:34:18] let's stand on our feet amen
