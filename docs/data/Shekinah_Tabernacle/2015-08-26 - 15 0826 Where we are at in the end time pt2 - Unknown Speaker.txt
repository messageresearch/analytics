somewhere else over here praise a look let's go to Ephesians wide and then we'll go to verse 13 down to this 11 Paul speaking here it is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints row which are Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus they meant grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace r and he hath made us accepted in the beloved and whom we have redemption through his blood forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace we're in here to bounded to us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together then one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance pink being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work with all things after the counsel of his own will hallelujah amen they may be seated grace a look a lord blesses would you know have you filled out just read that Lydia what do I want to continue where I was speaking on Sunday where we are at the end time yeah where are we in the employment we see here Paul is speaking about here saying at a certain time God is going to gather all you know a good Teddy's gonna that he might gather together and when all things in Christ which are in heaven and which aren't earth even at him see saying in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is when he's going to do these things and we understand from the reading of the scripture you can go back and you can you can read where where Moses came by the scene and there's a dispensation of the law and then when Jesus you know Jesus came to John the Baptist came there was a change for a dispensation of the law now are under the dispensation of grace so there's a change in the and how God was working and then there came still in the dispensation of grace now they came the dispensation of the cemetery changes so you know business has your grace came in and we understand that that will continue until we go for the rapture and then dispensation of grace will go into the juice to the 154,000 but within that time there Simmons your changes there's a rapture there's also a great tribulation a mint is a is a wedding supper of the Lamb there's all these things within that span but Paul is telling us set in and then when it comes jobs to the ends dispensation of the fullness of x is going to gather all one and we can see from the scripture that it will be at the end that God will do this where he will gather all one all things in Christ so I just want to say that we are in the dispensation of the fullness of time you know time has run out this there's no more changes to come there's no more to change messengers there's no more profits to the Gentiles all they're looking for us to change in these bodies as well this is where we are in the scripture you know there's no messenger then donate angel there's no you know anything that's that's there's nothing more for us what we have received we have received and we have received Christ at his fullness we're not looking for another message to come you know my brother branham when he is preaching the rapture message he he begins to place us in first Thessalonians 4 and he says that the message is the shelf you know so he and he doesn't leave at any mysterious like he just declares that the message is the shower so because of profit on their profit complacence and the work paul here was placing not just the Ephesians which is also true thee to the faithful in Christ Jesus and this letter speaks of us as well and him being a prophet he he placed the people he plays price of his position name above all names I above everything else and then he placed the believers position in Christ only a prophet can do those things and then so excuse me and then so we have now we have come down to the end time and brother and another prophet standing here saying this is where we are then time the message is the shower so he places the first Thessalonians chapter 4 saying this is where you up you have arrived here this is where you are present he's not taking a shot as good a company saying the message is the shower so you've already received it it had already been given you know revenue his ministry they just make you were making review ever well what has already come so he's placing he's placing the bright now this is where we are and it gives them credible I believe it gives incredible faith to a people that can see Jesus Christ in their day which we have saved me and give this incredible faith that this is so the Prophet can say this is where you are in the world and your next step is into immortality maybe this is where we are you always say you have arrived here and your next episode the immortality so a dispensation now the word dispensation of means and administration this is in the group that means of a household or estate and it's it yo specifically your religious or an economy and also means a dispensation of a stewardship so that's an administration of something so when Moses came he administered the law and the people fell under the administration you know the dispensation of the law and then now when John the Baptist came he he was called now to turn the people frog Moses to receive the one that Moses was pointing to because now had come and change in the season where the law was going to be fulfilled in a god man women and that same life would go to a believer that that spirited them will now look out that law amen so now there was a change now a dispensational change was taking place and we see let's just read some scriptures i just want to show you this go to Hebrews chapter 3 because Paul speaks about this as well here speaking of a edit and this dispensation being at administration because reread here in Hebrews free and good book that uh he says now he says wherefore holy brother partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession in Christ Jesus who are faithful to him that had a point of him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted word in more glory than Moses and so much that he who had builded the house had more honor than the house for every house that is builder by some man but he that felt all things as God and Moses belly was faithful in all this house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after so he was he was a faithful steward of the household of God he administered what was given to have the law he administered it and you can see that he administered it faithfully because when the tabernacle was built in the priesthood was arranged and all the vessels were placed and everything God came and filled that tavenner that was the vindication of Moses was the truth and God came down and dwelt among his people as the same thing now with Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior was here his vindication was God came in dwelt in his church amen that was just one occasion that was the proof that he not only died but he rose again and so we can see now that you know when whenever a there's a change of dispensation it's for God to Kevin being before with with with us big wonder the blood of bulls and go but now us to be in his people and we see that John the Baptist and he came in the spirit of Elijah and the purpose of the spirit of Elijah as as to do two things and we can see this in first Kings chapter 18 win when Elijah is there with the priests of a land on Mount Carmel and having that show down and there's 400 priests avail in there built their altar and you put their sacrifice there and they're trying to call fire down from their God out of heaven to consumer sacrifice and what happens now is Elijah standing here and he's waiting he's waiting for he's basically waiting for the evening time to come because he knows that that the priests of Baal cannot call barring him against the mock them saying man he called a bit louder maybe he's sleeping maybe he's pursuing maybe he's busy but all of it later you'll get his attention in it and he begins to mock them and what happens is during that climate says in first Kings 18 of verse 30 and Elijah stood up to all the people come near unto me so they were going to have a evangelistic service he's gathering the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down so here we have Israel is standing here on this mountain these people try to worship God and they're very older that was there to worship God is not even be built think about his believers who are in the promised land and their approach to God a lot as has has come into disarray and no one else noticed that the older was book was broken down was Elijah that revealed the altar he didn't build another old he rebuilt one that had already been there and so he he he rebuilt now the correct approach to God and then he you know he put the you know if you you know just the same time for ganja but you know that how he had the trench dug around Italy what the sacrifice there and they took barrels of water and they poured water on top of it so filled the mood around the around the altar and then at the evening time he begins to say in verse 37 it says here Mia o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again and it said then the fire the Lord Fallon consumed the burnt sacrifice and wouldn't dogs and the Dyson looked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell in their faces may hit the Lord he is God the Lord he is God so what's happened peace he's rebuilt the frick wait up to to worship God and he did this on the intent that the people's hearts would be turned back so their hearts would be turned so the purpose what God uses spirit of Elijah is for a real sacrifice to be instituted and for the field we turn back to the living god and you can see that in God's ministry that his purpose as the angel told his father luke 17 thing he says a now shop and he shall go before him in the spirit and parable is to turn the heart to the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared to the Lord that's why God see the light syrup on there that the people's hearts would be too I mean that they could receive the true sacrifice calamity and this is why John was sent now if you jump remember there's a change of dispensation therefore lauded grace and now we at the end now than the seventh church age have come down to a junction where the church ages have come to an end and now eternity is about to come a policy should time is fading out and eternity has come again so in order for this to happen God had to set Elijah again because of people had to truly know their God so the people had to be turned back to the faith of the fathers and that's why it says in Malachi for he shall behold I send your lives of the Prophet before the coming of the great dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and weary that's what John did and I have the children to their fathers least I come and smite the earth with a curse so God Henderson Elijah to the end time now to turn the people from their traditions and from there you know yep theological ideas and turn them to the true Living God that's why Elijah can go back into John the Baptist date they had their Bible schools they had their scholars they had their ideas and here came a man out of the wilderness so I'm going to point you to the real the real value movement here comes ulema call the tax where the sin of the world and you come down two thousand years and then we have our bible school and we have our theology and we have our ideas now smart man and here comes a man out of the seventh grade education from Kentucky say hold the Lamb of God amen amen any and he points the people to the real lamb would have got and so he points them back to the he points us back to the true relationship us and God and this is done this is done because of people because now the Falls of dispossession of times and people can go on a rapture if they believe in error you can't worship your God is a spirit and you must worship God in spirit and in truth as well Jesus and you must is not an option or maybe attack on you must worship God this way to the truth the truth had to be restored and even port die Peter forget to speak about the book of Acts he says whom the heavens must receive speaking of Jesus Christ until the restitution and that would means the restoration of all things so in order for a restoration to take place God send the spirit of Elijah upon the earth that the altar of the Lord would be rebuilt this would be placed correctly yeah x y 0 x 2 38 baptism the oneness of the god here you know all these things that we believe it what is that that is the ultimate rebuild because you know in order you can approach God if you believe these 10 or 20 or free or two you know you're you're approaching a different Jesus to the scripture and so I prepared the cabin identified this is Christ in the scripture and not only just saying this is how the scripture comes together so then the one he spoke about came upon the scene to vindicate what this man who was saying it was gone it was the true and this was done they the fire fell again in this study men can you and is not a natural fire as a Holy Spirit fire a man has fallen upon sacrifices Freeman I think as pulse they present your bodies a living sacrifice in so now now the truth of the word is preached and faint cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and then you recognize your loss and undone amen because there's an ultimate then you lay yourself up on that altar amen amen you lay yourself upon that revelation that's been given and then good the fire comes down and consumes you amen and when a when a sacrifice is consumed by fire and goes up in smoke and ashes and that thing isn't there anymore is the bunch of ashes hey there doesn't come back and be a beardy animal anymore it's the same thing with us when we someone lays himself upon the altar i'm in bed life is not the same it is not the same as head life that later south down and gets back up on the newness of life this was done this was God Henderson Elijah turn your heart amen if you if your heart is being too if you've heard this message in your heart as being you know something and you says that's true then God comes and changes your life your hardest thing to any been if your heart is being turned back to the paint of the phone they ain't God's no you don't do it God doesn't turn you know you didn't turn yourself maybe you've got a teacher so I wanna serve God but no man can and no one that seeks after God the scripture tells us there's no one righteous not one bit so God had to come and turn your heart yeah i mean you say what people say what's happened he say my heart's been to frame it all we got amen hallelujah so now he came now this had to happen because the people had to be prepared to meet the bridegroom in the same time and the front group is the left yep and how can you meet him unless you have a real relationship with them you know unless you're walking with them how can you how can you be ready for me them in the air you come so now brother branham says this Anderson feasts of the trumpets because we must look at you know here's the question is why does the fullest virgin go through the tribulation earth and the bride doesn't go through the tribulation it's because the pride receives the fullness of the atonement manchanda look like very low but every word doesn't mean you understand it put it all together you just say that's me I believe that we do I mean I maintain it turns you but then the other side I don't I don't agree with what you're you know what they're talking about and they come under a partial atonement because if a you know why would someone who's been totally forgiven have to go through the tribulation for a purge your extra purging because we know the tribulation is nature purges the whole world you know if purchase the full of virgil earp urges this route no why would someone who is nothing held against if it their slate is clean there's nothing holding them upon the early why would they have to go and get their life God is an unjust you see so but the only way you can receive full forgiveness as you receive the sacrifice maybe in the only way you can receive the sacrifice of your heart has been turned back to the sacrifice it's just believing the truth of God's work it's all boils down to i believe it we do that's right you know yes it's not a bunch of mental gymnastics it's like you hear the word faith cometh by hearing hearing the Word of God something and you says yes amen and that and that is reflected because there's a transformation of a life and a new life comes full of his might even you so now he says this in the face of the trumpet he says think of it as the end time folks hallelujah the great day the Lord has have had gather yourselves together fish to the Messiah they'll reject them and they'll find out that there is them aside the Bible said striking things with like this would take place and revelations the lever call their ministry of anniversary of Moses and Elijah calling out to Israel out of the Jewish traditions just like the seventh angels message called the bride out of the Pentecostal traditions remember Moses and Elijah is to call Israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and the sheep and the blood and the goats and the sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the work because now now there now they darken they think they don't even know who Jesus is the real lamb and then they're trying to rebuild something the Moses said so this is to worshipping under that old way but these two problems come Emma Moses calls an exodus like in the first one you call them out and Elijah Desmond was to turn them will turn them back to the original faith well according to the true sacrifice and CEO death part of their ministry so they won't because in revelation 11 it says it says the two witnesses and the call witnesses because they they preach the same thing we have already received that's right as we have received Jesus Christ it is foolish they preach the same thing they're a witness of what we have received and so they turn now the people back to the true you know back to the true sacrifice which is the word because the truth highs you then to Calvary because you are jesus said by teaching the commanders and daughters of men you make the Word of God Norfolk so by teaching the truth word of god you make the word of effect it was the effects forgiveness of all the Holy Ghost building the statue of God as the effect of the other the work so that's why I can say to chew them that's why I say people who truly receive this receive the work receive the sacrifice because the truth take ties you back in understand so he says that they will turn the people back to the living sacrifice to the work which is Jesus Christ and the seventh angels message under the same trumpet the same exact everything the same seal is to walk call the people the bribe out of the Pentecostal of world traditions to the genuine atoma the word Christ is his impersonated in his word here made flesh among us science has proven it bye-bye pictures the church knows in the world around we firmly not a feast for he never told us one thing as thus saith the Lord but what can be the truth they say now this ministry turn the people back to the truth relationship with Jesus Christ and that's what the two witnesses and revelations live in will do in a in a future time so it comes a point now we have this fullness this dispensation of the fullness of times now is a winding up of everything God has been doing down through the ages and it has to be a prophet had to come because when God was restoring things from Luther all the way up that was a reformation and Pentecostals of reformation the Pentecostal move was part of that Reformation it wasn't i was totally different to the restoration of the work that we have a mystic it was a reformation man's wisdom tied it all together but then they have 111 come who was going to take us old notes when he came to preach to seal this is I what you I study my old notes and I you know I wasn't too sure what it was and I was going to come out and preach that and you know would have made a terrible mistake if he didn't come down to the room and show me what a wife right so and we'd be on now guess what happened to penticoff which was the restoration of the gift and I can see he had the elijah ministry because the fire felt the Holy Ghost fire felt and you can see that because when God was restoring like the just shall live by faith it was a work of the spirit but it wasn't this birth welling in the people but they had salvation and then when Wesley came along sanctification they believe justification and they believe the sake of the guys in clean living there was another work of the spirit but it wasn't God dwelling in there but that was still had salvation and then the Pentecostal move was a restoration of the gifts and because it looked so much like the book of Acts they said we have arrived but they hadn't arrived but they had salvation but there's still another process had to come where went from gifts now to the giver himself stepping into the people in beer I meant for the real Holy Spirit fight or fall and abiding then not just anoint them not just give them a new spirit changing them changing this Europe but dwelling in their soul the very living one like this is why we have been turned to the true Pentecost amen we have been turned back to an azusa street Pentecost because of the zuzo street king of them just a restoration of gifts it was a work of God and we need the gifts I believe in the gift remove part of a paint if there's you know if there's salvation and this I want that of this eternal life or what that of autumn if there's a body change of on the body change if they're speaking in tongues I wants big and ugly but there's prophecy what prophecy is wisdom I want most to me there's gifts of healing I won't give some healing everything God has for me all over to even a men have you ever seen a little kindling birthday over one prison and they enjoy that prison and hear some other ones and they said I don't want those ones maybe shake them they sound eva they rip it open they get in that they played then they enjoy it people until they break it and they want something else go just like us we don't want to just be so here you go then you may be open the chat our first page that's cool and just you know and you say you want to read the rest of it no I genesis what it was nice that's how some people can be satisfied with just a little bit you know I heard a story about how your one guy it really love watermelon you're giving a little slice and and it's asked you enjoy that slice again yes good but I know there's more somewhere there's a rest of my watermelon somewhere we're looking for that watermelon amen so was the pride of Christ baby amen we have what we were received but don't just be satisfied what you've received I'm not trying to say all you have to get saved all over again look at what God has for you hunt it out find it by prayer and life is soon Amen if its salvation for our family want salvation for them I'm effort limit efforts of its God's people finding rest I want that yes sir I mean if it's piece of the only guys I want peace I was joy our one joy it was long suffering or what long so he said I mean if its patients all patients whatever it is it's michael immense way water we want to lay hold on the whole watermelon that's right Amy notice hold it and look at it just eat it become one with it amen no you sit back and you know we can't rest on yesterday's victory beer at the devil comes in your being bombarded taken back there maybe but don't just don't that you're pushing life just be a museum but I meant hey it's good to go back and you know and and look at what God has done always and don't just for yourself tell your family tell your children you know I don't think there's any question that says I'm sick of that person testified that's right i mean brother branham told stories of people being heal things that happened years before and he would he would tell like it was just the other day what happened he was he was keeping things that God did in front of the people and we should do the same thing good it made specially in the downtime because if God has started something because you know you must understand to follow this word in the stage of supernatural thing maybe it's a supernatural turning of a half it's not a this is not the highways anymore else this is not the easy road yeah this is not the right of popularity or acceptance or you know just easy living this is not this is not that this is the right good way that's right we call you walk a record way doesn't matter what what we have to go through just go through yeah right a man just just look beyond and come back tomorrow could be right now we'll be out of here amen amen just just look at that promise and keep walking into that promise yeah and I brother man tells us about being healed he says he says look at you look at yourself well and just walk into the province I mean because eventually your subconscious and conscious come together you receive what you mean same thing with the body chains just hold that before you and walk into it yeah and walk like a journey yours yeah and there's not one day maybe I'll get them it belongs you now they just look like you this is mine Thanks amen how do I know because of my hand hey get over the rules his diner but I really enjoy it and it didn't you hear all the time yes oh yeah hey Abraham looked like he was holding Isaac for 25 years he was walking like Ian's eyes and every day became greater and better to have a moral life he just held that perform and he walked into the vision yeah then the vision became material here a minute and either Yahtzee rahat the promised son and they deserve hardships I went through separation and family they went through all these different things but Abraham said this this is my promise this land belongs to me and I'm walking this way and the matter if there was you know it was great Wars going on we're here slumming social unrest and love was taking previous build up with war and all these six and he just kept the promise of forms yet this is mine and we're going to go get him women any I'm disservice he went and gone ooh and he's exactly like you or not hey the same faith is a neighbor hampers in the children of the place to see exactly the same thing I mean it was revealed to him to reveal to us oh maybe one day not one day now yeah hell yeah I'm it's a sign now that here we are the end and we have come to a true Pentecost where it's got beyond just gifts but now the giver dwells in us a mint that is it showing because everyone that is truly walking with God and the sour under this work it doesn't form some organization some people might try and organizer but the true ones who have been become one with him if the organization among them they see Pentecost showed its colors and animate denominations here and there right after Azusa Street few years after azusa street they split they argued they fuss and they made the wonders to turn us in the three nests of what's happening because it was a reformation of man and that's you see the first part of reformation they manage the nomination so all the rest of informations they make a denomination I mean my program Cynthia dying land made there never become a denomination after this it says isn't in going for 17 odd years and has been denomination around it he says normally after three years their former denomination of my dog and why why did that why has it not denominator because we are back to it was in the beginning in the book of Acts is no talk of denomination of my main men amen and Paul fought against an ego he fought against the BCS is the beasts an emphasis fought against these ones and then even even your the Lord when he speaks the Ephesian age he says this one thing he says thou has the deeds doesn't have the deeds of Nicolaitans you know that thing I hate and his cannon commending them for standing against those people calling and saying that they have called themselves apostles for the liars you've tried them here's commending them not for going down that road the real believers but they are walking with God amen why is why isn't this enough because we've been restored back to the original back to the original back to the first age exactly the same way now I can find us oh yeah here now where we have been turned to the original atonement and the fire god has drowsiness people you seen the book of Acts all the healing and all the manifestations they had to see I would sign of an inward life and God well again them was the major side you see and all those things were just displace of that and you can see it because in the book of Acts God would God send to the people separate to me full of Barnabas it was a divine leadership among the believers and then when where Paul was going to go to Rome you know God anointed agamous to hang his guns and bind his hands and you know this man who is bama this girl's going to go to Roman how Phillips daughter's problem site all these different things and they were walking now walking with God as he was fulfilling his work because all garden Rome was part of his work you know those missionary journeys in the word going out that was all part of us working fulfilled as part of week your walk ride was doing and so the people were under divine leadership because it comes down it wasn't just them going around but they're under the violation of God because the scripture tells us they did a led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God amen and they were walking you say well there's lots of people that say God homes with us whatever more but you have to take it back to the scripture and if it really is God you can fight it in the scripture if you can't find it in the scripture I'd say leave it alone and pray about it until God reveals another scripture and then when he does that just walk off because if you can't type cut into here then you can make it say whatever you wanted to say and so you see the book of Acts are divinely lead and the only way there could have been a book of Acts now I might just the only way that they could have been a book of Acts was that first there had to be an Elijah ministry to point out the Lamb of God and in that life of that land now came and rather than the people that's the only way they can be a book of Acts be written was all those things to happen and it's the same thing in the end time now is that they had fought for the true book of Acts to be written as they had to cover in Elijah ministry to point out the lamp and the vindication that he pointed out the lamb is because the life of that lab now wells and the people amen amen how do you know this message is trip to the life of the scriptures and me thank you and it quickens me to this does it quicker me to some church manual or some man's ideas and quickens me to this that's how nice the lots of Jesus Christ and so that is why now if we took out took our lives I'll testimonies back into the book of Acts we would just be walking around with them a member it caused our lives are writing a book of Acts yeah our lives are writing a book about Wes right you say well I haven't seen anyone raised from the dead and God allow that to happen it would happen right I mean you don't have that it's not about a checklist of I've done all these things as the life in you and when the life is in you yields that life and then whatever God wants to do he'll thought I'm amen we're not here to try and twist God's up you know we are yielded to the Lord and when he says pray for this person speak to this person brings us a new strap I just felt great lead to read the scripture about lead to send this person to watch out for right this little pray for this one what does that is divided leadership yes sir amen and that is all because we have been turned we have been turned the real lamp now to be anointed what this earth as on your spirit only is not the true pinnacle you'll understand what i mean by the book of yo azusa street the gifts of the Spirit were a work of the spirit but it wasn't God dwelling in his people yeah and so just to be anointed it is not the same as God well again you grow and the true Pentecost was first God came and dwelt in them and then he manifested himself and then the word work for and people receive salvation and so this is why now we you see the bride worldwide doesn't matter about what other people are claiming to do it all this stuff on the both sides of the dudes I'm not talking about that talk about the real believer down around the world they have the same character they have the same sweetness they have the same humility amen because the same doesn't matter if you're in Africa or your pump with you good in your vanuatu Australia New Zealand will send after or England or America wherever it is it is the same life amen because brother brahim tells us he says he says the grain is here you know and when he would take it and she takes a scripture from I think it's mike with which Jesus actually says about the crystal ratio of the growing of a week life but first comes the stall him in the tassel and then the sugar than the ground he actually jesus lizard these things out on scripture and so that was a restoration of what was planted in the dark ages and the Pentecostal moved further than was a grain they feel that arrived but they they would just think Terry off the life and it's in our profit status slice in about 50 learnings for the proper sentences the green is now here you see this is where we've arrived I meant at the same life that that diamond fell into the ground has come falls again they did and it's not a different it's not a lesser life you know Jesus was the first great the truck yep now if you can take so it tasted great and we are united with him that means we are the same quality great we are not elisa great what he has done for us and we're joint heirs with Christ we're not Alyssa we're not a single being great great we're a great team was a great we are a great we've been amen I'm just I'm already out basically but do you think about it we think you know he is amazing credible and how do we ever be like happen the reason we have response to help as for these are looking for part of himself yep he's looking he's looking for great this is I have a piece of grain where's the wall break the my god I must be full of great food and all of the father has given him welcome amen and there's a harvest is a gathering going on and the graders gathered into the bottom and the chaff in the you know all that stuff has been bound for the burning and so he's looking he's looking for parts of himself he's looking for something that's exactly like him hello whoever when he calls you that's like that's like you're Rebecca was was part of Isaac and so what you see in Isaac you seen Rebecca he gives us life she says old God just she just gives herself as other wishes go doesn't know who she's marrying you know just met this your le I said the other day she says all go and her family tried to hold her back stay another day you know a stab at longer but but he he he wouldn't delay he wouldn't delay is going because he's a faithful he's a faithful servant where he didn't have time to build an empire or some kingdom or some statues but he said I'm on a mission by finding a bride for my god for my master's son and so he he didn't delay and as soon as he found he he maybe send out let's go for senior and then and then since you're her family is trying to lay the guard and all these things and she just invited kind under the crunch Rebecca will you go she just gave yourself I would go you know who is I don't know who he is I've only just heard his name I heard about now angel look Calvin prepared me I mean I only just heard about this now I've already watered as camels I've already I've already given him a drink but now I've hit hearing testimony I'll an angel God will sit before this man and for some reason i responded when i saw a mess you know give you a drink and I'll give you a camera as you can say no I came under a supernatural of Lord amen I mean I just loved out that man's prayer hey you got read you can read Genesis rifle she had looked out his prayer and she doesn't even know him he prayed that way talk about a supernatural this supernatural at ain't thirsty is on 30 I am assisting of I wanted them to she was anointed amen to water to water those camels and she doesn't know that watering those camels those camels were going to do it too right away Khalid and we're here mother have says at the same Holy Ghost that we water without price and I were showing that we give Him glory remember giving it strength I mean to take us from this world into the next world yeah I mean when we praise the Lord we're watering most camel anyway I mean that power because a beast of burden as a power the scripture like a wharf the book of Revelation so that power we water and we give reverence to yeah we love is going to carry us away oh yeah because we're the full as a dispensation of time maybe they meant so that's how Isaac was reflected in Rebecca and then when they came together thank you amen Isaac they both recognized this is the part of me I'm looking at the other part of me amen repairing basil members she was kin kin to Isaac wasn't Alicia family wasn't blessed class and or whatever however want to put it over they work info they were blood relation you take that both brakes amen and here we are and God has called us and we have no but before we receive this word is that influence of angels are Potter amen all that influence it must be one life I satisfied with the slide it must be more to it than us because that is Angel's influencing you I mean they quicken a better scripture to you tell them because it's all real you're being driven and you can't exactly put it all together that is the Angels influence in your life amen to receive a visitation then the messages work comes your way he says now I'm going to show you to Isaac your account and use land all down to all go I'll Lou you amen amen and that is where we are that's the reason we respond you say well not enjoying this walk two months if you love him your heart has been too doesn't matter what trial you go through doesn't matter your family situation doesn't matter all that is irrelevant if your heart has been turned and you've heard that and you've heard that call that's all the matters you say I'm under it yo I'm going through a trial all those through the truck that's right one day I won't even be remembered I'm going through a struggle all those through the struggle just give it to God amen and just walk off yes that's all you need to do you say well I need to work something out give it to god everyone I mean this thing's from I possible deal with just give it to her baby we had a plenum heel but you know words the deep woods take a while to heal but as long as they're healing merely Council wrong with your taking medicine the you don't look at the mood anymore you just take the medicine so is it getting better I'm getting you even to show people I get scars and stuff look it's healing look at the stitches of falling out what time was bleeding everyone constant is here what's bleeding everywhere I said look at this is Col look it's all coming together you don't say oh I saw a murderous when terrible sure was it was terrible you know when you ruined it and Scotty on your skirt only six it was terrible through it I think comes a point now when you look at look how much is healing yeah better i'm getting hey Larry a min and you look at the positive effects that are going on because you're taking the medicine yeah they meant because you're taking the medicine so you know look at the scars look at what the medicine is doing to them he comes a point where you receive you all move it all back again and everything's just fine that you ever testimony yeah and he can use it as glory hey I mean the devil wounded me here but look what look what God has done for me yeah and then you can use that I can tell people knives are sharp be careful as a testimony amen and everything down in life he say that was terrible that happened or one thing about it why did he allow I don't know maybe you could mention it to someone else and they could not go down that road and they could have ended up a shipwreck amen and you can use those things for God's glory and up all them foul here now of course it takes wisdom to share things don't get me wrong but you know you could share look I stumbled and fell fell down into a deep cut for years I think God looked at me out that's right all i have is healed scars amen amen heels gather a sign of victory yes sir don't let it bow down don't let it clogged it down with a devil sake look what I hear you're used to do this and look how terrible your life walls analyzed up oh look at it that way I mean look as God delivered me sometimes yeah brother I'm tell the story like a shipyard like a sheep with I mean a shepherd and the shepherd broke a leg of one of his sheep and you know the guy goes shipping why would you do that to your sheep you see while he was straight it wasn't paying attention to my voice and I had to do this or allow this I can pick them up and I can nurse him and I can hit the brake and I'm combined it up and I've been show my life to that chick and look he loves me out yeah that's it towards the chip it but if you take it the right way that's how God allows things sometimes where we being in our little human running around me we don't listen and God allows us not to listen and with God's sovereign over everything the devil has nothing over amen you say well the devil trip me up there god never say to me before you take the women for God talk about job Satan had to get permission to do that to Jordan I mean and it's like everything before the devil comes your way Satan has asked your father about it first and your father has given him permission to do whatever he has to do and he has confidence in you and no matter how terrible may see you're going to come out the other and even better mean amen hey ever worked for over to work that's true for us and God allows that that then he can reveal himself in a great away a job sent one day you know I wish still as a man go no I wish I knew where God looked I'm just add loving but you know who the story is I wish I newbury look so I've got to his house I could talk to him speaking of God but there came a point where he said I've heard of thee but now I see thee and said I know my redeemer lover he says with these eyes I'll set upon the surf at all you know I'll stand by you I'll see God before they need to know those things I mean you say well it's terribly the losers family and lose all these God knew and also Joe sacrificed on behalf of his family I believe they had salvation amen but all that was just like the Shepherd the sainted was allowed to go after Joe that God could pick job up and reveal himself that joke can have a revelation of the resurrection sometimes we go through things as near for our good we are under standard this is all because mo where the dispensation of the fullest apart better people must live out what's in here and so people have to live out jobs experience people have to live out Moses experience i SAT writing from God like Jonah he ran from God end up in a belly of a whale you know people people run from God and it and it's done in such a way God allows it to happen that god can reveal himself in a greater way we're just like Abraham people the in time have to look up what Abraham did I mean that they have to leave it leave with a frog go to a strange land I'm not gonna magic geographically too much spiritually leave this leave this land leave this denomination leave this religion whatever it is and I'll show you another place to go and God has done that amen because all those things Bengal down the Bible make bound together now and there's a people that are living out those stories that were just some type of doubtful I'm ever just sleep in it shall be Lord Jesus father we know you're in control of all things Lord we just I just want to
