[4:59] [Music]
[5:00] hello how are you all this morning happy
[5:04] and
[5:07] [Music]
[5:08] healthy I believe we can blame sin for
[5:12] the
[5:15] cold I think Before the Flood The Temper
[5:17] the climate was slightly different I
[5:20] think there was a nice firmament and it
[5:22] was like a glass house you know like
[5:23] like a glass house is always a nice
[5:25] temperature there wasn't rain and there
[5:27] wasn't
[5:28] this this
[5:30] cold
[5:31] wind it was a nice uh environment for
[5:34] the human body to dwell in you
[5:37] know then after that all sort of change
[5:40] then we get all these funny Seasons
[5:41] where it's like hot and then it's cold
[5:43] and then it's windy and it's this and
[5:45] that and then we our frail human bodies
[5:49] get thrown
[5:51] around but I'm glad that there's a place
[5:53] where it's not going to be like that
[5:54] we're going to have a nice Eden again
[5:56] where the conditions for the human body
[5:58] are going to be nice but while we're
[6:00] here we press on whether it's cold or
[6:03] whether it's hot whether it's sunny
[6:06] whether it's blind a gale we press on
[6:09] because that's what a Believer does and
[6:11] that's what that's what we you know
[6:12] that's the that's the the journey that
[6:15] we have to walk here but we're thankful
[6:16] that you know with the Lord we go
[6:18] through the highs and the lows all
[6:19] together so we're going to have a good
[6:20] time in the Lord we just pray those
[6:22] we'll just stand and commit the service
[6:24] to the Lord and and just those that are
[6:26] streaming God bless you um and you let's
[6:29] just commit the service to the Lord
[6:30] Heavenly Father
[6:31] we're thankful Lord that we can enter
[6:35] into your house this morning Lord and
[6:37] meet you Lord and with these frail human
[6:40] bodies Lord we just thank you that that
[6:43] that there is an end to all this Lord to
[6:45] this this place of sin where we dwell
[6:47] Lord and this this place where we we
[6:50] have ups and downs and highs and lows
[6:52] Lord but it's in these times Lord when
[6:54] when we get sick Lord we know you as a
[6:56] Healer Lord when we we know you as a
[6:59] comforter Lord we can experience these
[7:01] the we can experience Darkness here Lord

[7:14] and you're the god that provides Lord so
[7:15] we just thank you so much for these
[7:17] experiences that we go through in this
[7:19] this realm Lord because it it it Lord it
[7:22] draws us closer to you it it shows us
[7:24] who you are Lord and you can express
[7:26] yourself Lord as a father as a savior as

[43:27] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[43:30] God bless you friends you can have your
[43:32] seats uh the uh this morning so I want
[43:34] to I want to talk about picking up the
[43:37] sword of the spirit today amen and and
[43:40] it's very and really where this ties in
[43:42] is is is attitudes we're going to make a
[43:43] segue through halfway through the
[43:45] service about attitude but this is where
[43:46] we're going to go but you see now as as
[43:49] um as the Apostle Paul would say is to
[43:52] be able to stand in the evil day now
[43:55] this is verse uh 13 the prophet tells us
[43:58] this is the evil day this is the day
[44:00] when no one can pretend to be a
[44:02] Christian anymore am mean you can you're
[44:04] either filled with the Holy Ghost or
[44:06] you're not and you need to get filled
[44:07] amen but no one can just float along and
[44:09] no see see the enemy is so great in this
[44:12] day and he's manifesting himself so much
[44:15] in this day but we know he is just a
[44:18] copy and a counterfeit because God is
[44:20] pouring out a spirit more and more but I
[44:22] just want to emphasize you cannot just
[44:24] be part of the group and overcome you
[44:26] must know him and the 's Resurrection
[44:28] every every brother even says one one
[44:32] place says God hasten the day that
[44:34] everyone will be who they are on their
[44:36] heart I say God hasten that day that if
[44:39] you're a Believer be a believer if
[44:40] you're not a Believer become a Believer
[44:42] if you're make believer become a real
[44:43] believer amen but what you really are
[44:45] you know just just don't don't pretend
[44:47] be a genuine Christian and I believe we
[44:49] are genuine Christians but but don't
[44:51] just you know but you see we're standing
[44:53] in this evil day now we we must take the
[44:56] sword of the spirit amen amen we must
[44:59] fight in this battle we got to realize
[45:01] that we're in a battle amen we're not in
[45:02] a picnic you say I didn't I didn't sign
[45:05] up for a fight well you signed up for a
[45:07] fight amen whether you like it or not
[45:09] every human being is in a battle amen
[45:11] whether they realize there's a devil and
[45:13] they realize there's a God or they don't
[45:15] they're still in a battle amen people
[45:17] label all kind uh label the enemy in his
[45:19] works all kind of different things but
[45:21] we got to recognize he's more than a
[45:23] thought amen he he's a being he wants to
[45:26] take you out amen but we're anointed to
[45:28] take him out Amen to to destroy our
[45:31] enemy now well we've got to realize that
[45:33] our weapon is the most powerful weapon
[45:36] that this sword of the spirit does not
[45:38] break it does not get blunt amen but as
[45:41] powerful as ever been now even the
[45:43] weakest of Christians has the right to
[45:45] wield this weapon that's it brother BR
[45:48] would say that see see Jesus when he was
[45:50] standing there in his great Temptation
[45:51] in the wilderness he would he defeated
[45:54] Satan with Satan's great attacks on him
[45:56] he defeated with it is written proving
[45:59] that even the weakest of Christians can
[46:01] stand and they can quote that word in
[46:03] faith and they can defeat this the devil
[46:05] any place any time see no matter who he
[46:08] is what form he comes and where he's at
[46:11] it will defeat Satan am mean so if it
[46:13] comes in the form of depression it'll
[46:15] defeat that if it comes in the form of
[46:17] self-importance it'll defeat that it'll
[46:19] come in the form of lust it'll defeat
[46:21] that it'll come in a form of insecurity
[46:23] it'll defeat that amen feeling that you
[46:26] don't belong it'll defeat that it'll
[46:27] defeat every form he comes in the word
[46:30] of God will defeat him amen and it's
[46:33] been proven Through the Ages and it's
[46:35] been proven in this day amen that the
[46:37] word of God see we cannot be like those
[46:39] Buffalo standing watching one of our own
[46:41] be eaten me we cannot be disabled and
[46:45] let the enemy think well we can't do
[46:47] anything about it and we cannot let fear
[46:49] rule Our Lives sinking that if we stand
[46:51] on the battlefield he's going to take us
[46:53] out no let's just let's just kill that
[46:55] thing right now let's just kill that
[46:57] thing right now okay amen now we've got
[47:00] to realize that God did not make you and
[47:02] I just to see if he could make you and I
[47:05] he made us for a purpose therefore there
[47:07] is a purpose for all of us being here
[47:09] who's the all that includes all of us
[47:11] right there's a purpose for us being
[47:13] here we're not just to be here to be
[47:15] another human being you're here because
[47:18] God made you for some purpose you're not
[47:20] here just to eat the food that God grow
[47:22] you're not here just to live in the
[47:23] house that man made or wear the clothing
[47:25] that someone fashioned you're here for a
[47:27] specific purpose no matter how little
[47:29] you are how big you are how important
[47:32] you are or how unimportant you are
[47:34] you're here to serve a purpose now is
[47:36] everyone on board this morning we're
[47:38] here for a purpose you're not here to
[47:39] fill in time you're not just another
[47:41] bunch of jeans walking around your DNA
[47:43] walking around in the human body no
[47:45] you're here for a purpose right and
[47:47] we're here to fulfill God's purpose
[47:49] right not just your own purpose or
[47:51] anything else's purpose God's purpose
[47:53] now just as my finger is here for a
[47:56] purpose my on my fingers for a purpose
[47:58] my eye and every part of our bodies to
[48:00] serve a purpose it was not just here to
[48:02] not just put here to just to see what it
[48:05] would look like when it was put here but
[48:06] it was here put here to serve its
[48:09] purpose it was God's divine plan to do
[48:11] so and if we are put here for a purpose
[48:14] then there is nothing everyone say
[48:17] nothing nothing can destroy us until
[48:20] God's purpose is fulfilled I mean so
[48:22] nothing can destroy you till God's
[48:25] purpose is fulfilled in your life
[48:26] nothing Nutter zip nothing zil nothing
[48:29] can take you out until God's purpose is
[48:32] fulfilled so if that be the case why are
[48:34] we afraid to take the sword of the word
[48:37] and chop the enemy's head off see people
[48:39] get worried they think well if I step
[48:41] forward onto the battlefield then I'm
[48:42] going to see a lot of trouble sure you
[48:44] might see a lot of trouble but nothing
[48:46] can take you amen until God's purpose is
[48:49] fulfilled in your life Lord amen and we
[48:51] just got to think about it how great it
[48:54] is to go from this world to the next
[48:55] World you say well has anyone had that
[48:57] kind of experience as I said a few weeks
[48:59] ago Christine had a death near death
[49:01] experience in Switzerland am in where
[49:03] she had an anaphylactic reaction from
[49:05] traod she's dying she actually left her
[49:07] body in the hospital she watched her
[49:09] auntie weeping over her body she's being
[49:11] lifted up into the most glorious place
[49:13] and she wanted all she wanted to do was
[49:15] tell her auntie how marvelous it was I
[49:18] mean to the place she was going amen it
[49:20] was the opposite to the rich man in
[49:22] Lazarus the rich man wanted someone to
[49:24] go back and testify how terrible this
[49:25] place was but Christin want to tell
[49:27] everyone how great it is to go up into
[49:30] Glory right so I've already had someone
[49:32] who's had an experience sitting in our
[49:33] midst how great it is to
[49:35] die but her purpose wasn't finished I
[49:38] mean she's still here upon the Earth for
[49:40] a specific reason and nothing can take
[49:42] you out till God's purpose is fulfilled
[49:44] so if she can have a testimony saying
[49:46] it's actually a glorious thing why
[49:48] should we be afraid oh the devil could
[49:50] kill me well that means my purpose is
[49:52] done God's done with me he's just taking
[49:54] me home he's just I'm just graduating up
[49:57] into Glory Hallelujah so why should we
[50:00] be afraid of the enemy trying to see
[50:02] we're going to realize he can't touch a
[50:04] ha on our head until he's first asked
[50:06] our heavenly father permission to do so
[50:09] am mean before he could touch job he had
[50:10] to ask his father permission and God
[50:13] said go for it amen I've Got Confidence
[50:14] in job am mean because God CU job had
[50:17] confidence in the shed blood amen so
[50:19] nothing could happen to job without the
[50:21] devil first getting permission and the
[50:23] devil could only do what he is permitted
[50:25] to do amen amen so if that be the case
[50:29] friends why should we be worried why
[50:30] should we be afraid see to do nothing is
[50:33] to be defeated to do nothing is to be
[50:36] defeated but to stand and say God said
[50:38] so it's right I Take God at his word I'm
[50:40] not putting up with the Enemy anymore
[50:42] that's Victory amen amen but you see we
[50:44] need courage to stand on the battlefield
[50:46] amen we are not weaklings we're not
[50:48] cowards amen the devil may try and make
[50:50] you think you're a coward you're not a
[50:51] coward you're a rugged Christian filled
[50:54] with the Holy Ghost more than a
[50:55] conqueror amen you can stand shoulder
[50:57] to- shoulder with the Apostle Paul where
[50:59] he says I'm more than a conqueror
[51:00] through Christ you said amen Apostle
[51:02] Paul I know what that's like amen cuz
[51:05] I've overcome in my age just like you
[51:07] overcame in your age amen don't doubt
[51:09] these things friends we are not we will
[51:11] not be taken out amen until God has
[51:15] ordained its time Hallelujah nothing can
[51:17] harm us until that purpose that God has
[51:19] put us here for has been made manifest
[51:21] praise the Lord no matter how much
[51:23] trouble we have how much heartaches or
[51:25] Sorrows we go through all of these for
[51:28] reasons there's a reason for
[51:31] it hallelujah
[51:33] hallelujah I think we can Rejoice this
[51:35] morning amen nothing can take us until
[51:38] our purpose is fulfilled amen the Bride
[51:41] of Jesus see see God the devil cannot he
[51:44] can't get anything over God right so why
[51:47] would we be afraid to take the word take
[51:50] God at his word and kill that enemy
[51:52] that's so wrestling against us why why
[51:55] would we sit still and be know there's a
[51:57] time to speak this is a time to speak
[51:59] this is a time to take remember that
[52:01] sword that landed in the prophet's hand
[52:02] in Sabino Canyon where is that sword now
[52:04] it was preached where is it it's a new
[52:06] but it's got to come out and speak
[52:08] against the enemy amen so see friends we
[52:11] have been placed in a place amen Christ
[52:13] has made us join his with himself right
[52:16] amen so so we are as powerful as he is
[52:20] amen we're as sinless as he is because
[52:22] he became sin for us who knew no sin
[52:24] that we'd be made the very righteousness
[52:26] of God God in Christ right I mean
[52:29] because we're joint ear with him where
[52:30] he is in power and position we are in
[52:32] power and position this is how powerful
[52:35] our weapon is amen cuz we joint ears
[52:37] with him he did not seat us on a lower
[52:40] seat than himself no we're on equal
[52:42] terms with him cuz he elevated us to
[52:44] that position I trust that's not too
[52:46] strong just chew it for a bit and
[52:47] swallow it'll be fine amen but don't be
[52:50] you because because the devil wants us
[52:52] to think we're just another bunch of
[52:53] human beings you're not because of God
[52:56] Grace you're not I mean because of God's
[52:59] mercy you're not amen right without it
[53:02] we are the same as everyone else but God
[53:04] has done a work in our lives now God
[53:06] wants to use that work and shake the
[53:08] devil's Kingdom amen wants to take the
[53:10] devil's head off he wants to give you
[53:11] Victory now we are seated brother Bram
[53:13] Cesar in God of this evil age now just
[53:15] as your natural life and traits is
[53:17] handed down from natural breeding of
[53:19] your of your father so is the spirit of
[53:21] God that was predestinated before the
[53:24] foundation of the world and when the
[53:25] entire world word of God incomplete was
[53:27] headed up in a human body called Jesus
[53:29] Christ in there God made me pay for my
[53:32] sins in him there then he rose me raised
[53:34] me up with him in the resurrection and
[53:36] now we're seated with him with power and
[53:38] authority over every devil now let's
[53:41] just go back people stumble at that God
[53:43] made me pay for my sins in him there he
[53:46] paid for my sins amen right it's just
[53:48] like just say Chris you know just say I
[53:51] work I get a paycheck she spends
[53:55] it right
[53:57] by product by product but you see so
[54:01] what I earn she
[54:03] spends okay me earning it because we're
[54:06] one is the same as her earning it
[54:08] because we're one amen right that's it
[54:12] more of the brothers should have said
[54:13] amen
[54:15] there some do but you see because we're
[54:18] one what I do she gets and what she does
[54:21] I get cuz we're one right and because
[54:24] Christ and his bride are one remember
[54:26] we're one before the foundation of the
[54:28] world right we came into a body at time
[54:30] with spiritual Amnesia he had to redeem
[54:32] us back to himself bring us back to that
[54:35] Oneness again that we had before the
[54:36] found remember the devil can't change in
[54:39] time what God has ordained in eternity
[54:41] amen so if you were with him with the
[54:43] Lord before the foundation of the world
[54:45] he wrote your name on his Lamb's Book
[54:47] before the foundation of the world the
[54:48] devil can't there's not enough rubbing
[54:51] compound no twink nothing that can erase
[54:53] your name off that Lamb's Book of Life
[54:55] the devil can invent amen so that's why
[54:58] you know it says he made me pay you know
[54:59] people stumble at those things but you
[55:01] got to realize no we're one amen and I
[55:03] don't read that statement say look how
[55:04] great I am I said know look how great he
[55:08] is and now we are seated with him with
[55:10] power and authority over every devil oh
[55:12] if you could only believe what God has
[55:14] given am me see but if you're not seated
[55:17] there you don't have it and if you're
[55:18] seated there and don't believe it and
[55:19] afraid to move you'll never use it but
[55:21] if you're seated there you'll use it for
[55:23] you're ordained to do what you do amen
[55:25] so if you're seated there you will take
[55:27] the sword of the spirit and you will

[56:10] this is after they won the great victory
[56:11] over the enemy they say praise the the
[56:13] Lord for avenging of Israel when the
[56:15] people willingly offered themselves amen
[56:18] so when the people willingly offered
[56:20] themselves that's when the enemy was
[56:22] that's when the Lord Avenged Israel
[56:24] that's when that's when the Lord fought
[56:26] for Israel and won a great Victory when
[56:28] the people were willing to step into the
[56:30] battle amen are you willing to step into
[56:32] the battle are you youo we're not here
[56:34] just to dig trenches we don't live in a
[56:36] world or one kind of mentality dig a
[56:38] trench fortified bunkers sandbags
[56:40] machine guns artillery and suicide
[56:43] charges no we're not made to do that
[56:45] kind of thing we're here to have total
[56:47] Victory amen where it's a moving Warfare

[56:56] of a life we're not a stagnant pool
[56:58] hallu no we're a Fountain of Living
[57:00] Water amen that flows overflowing amen
[57:03] but you see it's when the people are
[57:04] willing to willingly offer themselves to
[57:07] go beyond just the status
[57:09] quo there was a man called Arnold Von
[57:12] winkl of Switzerland I love the story I
[57:15] just love it Hallelujah I thought he is
[57:17] willingly that said there's a painting
[57:19] of it but you know they were fighting
[57:20] the ostran the austrians had come and
[57:22] invaded Switzerland they're just a bunch
[57:24] of farmers they didn't have many weapons
[57:26] those they're outnumbered but Arnold Von
[57:28] winad said today I'll give my life for
[57:30] Switzerland and he said and and then all
[57:32] of his men said what are you going to do
[57:33] he said just just follow me and he
[57:36] screamed out Make Way for Liberty the
[57:38] The Story Goes and he grabbed those big
[57:40] Pikes those big Spears and thrust them
[57:42] into his own bosom made a made a gap in
[57:44] the um Austrian formation the Swiss PED
[57:46] in there and and they won a great
[57:47] Victory and Switzerland was free cuz
[57:50] someone willingly offered themselves now
[57:52] this is just a natural Warfare it's an
[57:54] incredible thing what about now a
[57:56] supernatural Warfare you got to realize
[57:58] the Lord conquered because he offered
[58:00] himself that our lord Jesus did not did
[58:03] not know just you know no he gladly went
[58:06] to Calvary cuz he said Lord not my will
[58:09] but thy will be done so what he was
[58:11] ordained to do what the scripture
[58:12] prophesied he would do he gladly did he
[58:14] surrendered to it and we got to realize
[58:17] we're here to fulfill the scripture too
[58:19] I mean we're here that the Lord would
[58:20] fully prove the power of the blood in
[58:23] our lives amen so they won a great
[58:25] victory that day it's when the people
[58:26] willingly offer themselves amen and it
[58:29] must be the same thing today see great
[58:31] victories come because of great
[58:33] sacrifice but do you want the victory
[58:36] amen

[58:57] the Presbyterian the Christian Science

[59:01] that hold you back you have to cut
[59:03] through it you got to take the word of

[59:29] give it to you the land's over there but
[59:31] before you get there you've got to fight
[59:33] that's what the matter with people today
[59:34] they're afraid to stand and fight what
[59:36] we need is I must fight if I should rign
[59:38] increase my courage Lord must I be
[59:41] carried to heaven on uh home to heaven
[59:44] on a flowery bed of ease when others
[59:45] fought to win the prize and sail through
[59:47] bloody Seas no I must fight if I must
[59:51] rain that's right and where so wishy
[59:53] washy boneless helpless spineless as
[59:55] worms I think of old buddy Robertson he
[59:57] got down to the cornfield he said Lord
[59:59] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when
[1:00:01] you come back to earth you'll find
[1:00:03] you're going to find a pile of bones
[1:00:04] laying
[1:00:06] here you start fighting when you really
[1:00:08] mean
[1:00:09] it right it's not just lip service it's
[1:00:11] not just nice to day when your heart
[1:00:12] says yes Lord I must have this amen but
[1:00:15] we must must we be carried to home to
[1:00:18] heaven on a flowery bed of East we're
[1:00:19] not going to have that flowery bed of
[1:00:20] East that flower bed of East when others
[1:00:23] fought to win the prize and sail through
[1:00:25] bloody sea no we'll be able to stand
[1:00:27] there with the rest of the ages admire
[1:00:30] what they did but not shring back and
[1:00:32] say Lord how did you let me get through
[1:00:33] like this no it will be his Supreme
[1:00:36] Grace in our lives will be the reason
[1:00:38] we're on the other side and it's his
[1:00:40] Supreme Grace in our lives that will
[1:00:42] give us every Victory but we've got to
[1:00:44] surrender to that Grace and say Lord you
[1:00:46] want to give it to me I want to receive
[1:00:48] it amen
[1:00:51] hallelujah now this word as it says take
[1:00:54] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:00:56] the spirit which is the word of God now
[1:00:58] that word take means to receive it
[1:01:00] you've got to receive the helmet of
[1:01:02] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:01:03] now that word of God there uh where we
[1:01:06] get the word it's from from the word
[1:01:08] Rema which is something that's been
[1:01:09] uttered by a living voice a thing that's
[1:01:11] spoken I like it scoffield puts it as
[1:01:13] the inspiration of God so he says take
[1:01:17] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:01:18] the spirit which is the inspiration of
[1:01:21] God I mean when we when we receive the
[1:01:23] word and the inspiration that's given in
[1:01:26] when it becomes a quickened living
[1:01:28] reality amen that changes everything
[1:01:31] that's what really cuts through the
[1:01:32] enemy you see we started with Shamar
[1:01:35] Shamar was afraid to fight yeah brother
[1:01:39] Bram dramatizes it we know the story
[1:01:41] very well but let's put ourselves in
[1:01:42] those shoes once again where Shamar
[1:01:45] Harvest time after harvest time the
[1:01:47] enemy the Philistines would come in and
[1:01:49] take his crop so he would just get
[1:01:51] through the winter time he would just
[1:01:53] get through you know the different
[1:01:54] seasons where he didn't have much food
[1:01:56] and his family was getting smaller and
[1:01:58] smaller thinner and thinner you know
[1:02:00] their clothes were getting more ragged
[1:02:02] so you know and a part of them would
[1:02:04] have been well at least we're still
[1:02:06] alive but they were being defeated by
[1:02:09] the enemy now remember Shamar shanga was
[1:02:12] a circumcised Israelite living in his
[1:02:15] Promised Land he wasn't a gentile he was
[1:02:18] even if he was a gentile yeah but but he
[1:02:20] had a God made a covenant with him right
[1:02:23] and to me that's the biggest thing God
[1:02:25] has made a Covenant with you and I amen
[1:02:27] just like you know the rainbow I was
[1:02:29] driving home the other day and I saw a
[1:02:31] rainbow I was thinking about it how you
[1:02:32] know it says in Genesis God said when I
[1:02:35] see the rainbow in the sky I will
[1:02:37] remember my Covenant right that I won't
[1:02:39] flood the Earth again many times we
[1:02:41] think of it as when we see the rainbow
[1:02:43] we remember God's covenant no when we
[1:02:46] see the rainbow we should remember God
[1:02:49] remembers his
[1:02:50] Covenant amen it's a very different
[1:02:52] thing God is putting a symbol in the sky
[1:02:55] say saying I remember my promise amen
[1:02:58] and God remembers all of his promises
[1:03:01] amen he doesn't leave one on the side
[1:03:03] one doesn't collect dust one doesn't
[1:03:04] become old and stagnant one there's not
[1:03:07] one in the two hard basket God remembers
[1:03:09] his Covenant with his people am mean and
[1:03:12] we're a covenant people this morning God
[1:03:14] made a covenant with you am mean sure
[1:03:16] you made a covenant with them Lord I'll
[1:03:17] serve you I'll give you my life Here I
[1:03:19] Am Lord but he made the Covenant with
[1:03:21] you long before you ever said your side
[1:03:23] of the deal and he knew you could not
[1:03:25] keep
[1:03:26] it remember this this Covenant we have
[1:03:28] with our God is an unconditional
[1:03:30] Covenant am me as brother R would tell
[1:03:32] in the Old Testament there would always
[1:03:33] be a you know agreement between two
[1:03:35] people that would have a sacrifice
[1:03:37] between them because they would say if
[1:03:39] we cannot keep our side of the bargain
[1:03:41] may we be like the sacrifice and God
[1:03:44] knew we couldn't keep it that's why he
[1:03:45] died on
[1:03:46] Calvary amen he knew we couldn't keep it
[1:03:49] he knew the Frailty and failure of a
[1:03:51] human being so he said well I will
[1:03:53] become the sacrifice hallelujah
[1:03:55] hallelujah amen so we're a covenant
[1:03:57] people you see shamgar was a covenant
[1:03:59] believer in the Lord he is a message
[1:04:01] believer of the of the hour in those
[1:04:03] days but he was standing there defeated
[1:04:07] afraid he had the sword of the spirit
[1:04:09] but he had to pick it up he had to
[1:04:11] receive it he had to take it amen he had
[1:04:13] to start using it amen but he would no
[1:04:16] doubt reason well at least we're still
[1:04:17] alive at least we're still a family
[1:04:19] together I say the enemy he was like one
[1:04:21] of those Buffalo watching the Lions chew
[1:04:23] up one of them he was like one of to
[1:04:25] those people you see but there came
[1:04:28] something what struck him the
[1:04:30] inspiration of the word am mean came
[1:04:32] inspired him when he heard that certain
[1:04:34] season where you know the Harvest was in
[1:04:36] everything was done and then he heard
[1:04:38] those same boots marching down the road
[1:04:41] the Philistines am mean 600 of them it's
[1:04:43] amazing how how how the enemy knew more
[1:04:46] about shamgar than Shamar knew about
[1:04:47] himself the enemy knew the potential of
[1:04:50] Shamar why else would he send 600
[1:04:52] soldiers against one
[1:04:53] farmer two or even one would have done
[1:04:56] it but the enemy saw the potential in
[1:04:59] Shamar he says boys we're got to go a
[1:05:01] lot of us he doesn't know who he is what
[1:05:05] a fool but there come a
[1:05:08] season Hallelujah there always comes a
[1:05:10] season hallelujah amen you may be
[1:05:12] downtrod you may be beaten you may be
[1:05:14] oppressed but there comes a season amen
[1:05:17] when the inspiration of the word strikes
[1:05:19] you CU you got to realize this whole
[1:05:21] armor of God Amen it will come into
[1:05:23] manifestation there's not one of us will
[1:05:25] leave unarmed there's not one of us will
[1:05:27] leave defeated no we're going to go out
[1:05:29] packing the victory Hallelujah so there
[1:05:32] so those so those boots amen coming down
[1:05:34] the road that he heard that struck him
[1:05:37] yeah hallelujah it's amazing the enemy
[1:05:40] does something that causes inspiration
[1:05:41] to hit God's children amen it's like the
[1:05:43] you know Samson was bound and he heard
[1:05:45] the shouts of the Philistines and the
[1:05:47] anointing of God came on and broke the
[1:05:49] bands and he killed them all Hallelujah
[1:05:51] why he took the he took the sword of the
[1:05:52] spirit amen amen so Shamari heard the
[1:05:55] boot stomping down the road he saw the
[1:05:57] state of his family and he realized I'm
[1:05:59] not going to be one of these silent
[1:06:01] Buffalo I'm going to use these horns
[1:06:03] God's given me I'm going to I'm going to
[1:06:05] kill everyone amen why he received the
[1:06:07] inspiration of the word he knew in his
[1:06:09] head one will chase a thousand but when
[1:06:11] it was inspired to him see he just took
[1:06:13] what he had amen and killed every single
[1:06:16] one of them and he wasn't satisfied till
[1:06:18] they were all
[1:06:19] dead hallelujah hallelujah why because
[1:06:22] he picked up the inspiration of the word
[1:06:25] amen the spiration was given it was the
[1:06:26] inspiration he received it and and it
[1:06:28] manifested that inspiration in his life
[1:06:31] amen you look at you look at Mo Moses
[1:06:33] amen he didn't have the sword of the
[1:06:35] spirit when he killed one Egyptian he
[1:06:37] didn't have the sword of the spirit but
[1:06:38] at the burning bush God said I'm going
[1:06:40] to armor you Moses I mean you tried with
[1:06:43] your armor of intellectual understanding
[1:06:44] and your upbringing and where you're
[1:06:46] from and all these things sure you're
[1:06:47] the promised son but you're not dressed
[1:06:50] right see you're not dressed right amen
[1:06:52] so he received the full armor of God at
[1:06:54] the burning bush because the baptism of
[1:06:56] the Holy Ghost is the full armor of God
[1:06:58] that's right you don't receive the Holy
[1:06:59] Ghost then get the full armor no they're
[1:07:01] one and the same our armor on the inside
[1:07:04] Hallelujah so so he received the full
[1:07:07] armor of God and he had the staff in his
[1:07:09] hand it was just a dead staff but when
[1:07:11] it was inspired see I mean when it
[1:07:13] became the inspiration of God throw it
[1:07:16] down became a serpent did everything
[1:07:17] with that stuff brought all the plagues
[1:07:19] everything why cuz it was the sword of
[1:07:21] the spirit in his handu amen and what do
[1:07:24] God placed in our hand the name name of
[1:07:25] Jesus Christ has been placed as a rod of
[1:07:28] Deliverance in your hand am me to bring
[1:07:30] Deliverance to bring Salvation to bring
[1:07:32] joy to bring the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:07:34] Revival I mean to bring the defeat of
[1:07:36] the every enemy amen it's been placed in
[1:07:38] your hand not just the prophet's hand
[1:07:40] it's been placed in your hand amen God
[1:07:42] wants the same inspiration that brought
[1:07:44] the word to come into your life and to
[1:07:46] manifest the word amen so he went down
[1:07:48] to Egypt says let my people
[1:07:50] go and he cut through the threatenings
[1:07:53] he cut through the trouble he cut
[1:07:55] through fear in his great palace bunch
[1:07:56] of nonsense bunch of dead bunch of
[1:07:58] royalty didn't mean nothing to God Amen
[1:08:00] and he said I'm not leaving one hoof
[1:08:02] behind so he cut through compromise he
[1:08:05] cut through agreements he cut through
[1:08:06] all this nonsense he no we're all going
[1:08:09] am mean because the word of God has to
[1:08:11] be fulfilled I mean because God promised
[1:08:13] our forbear Abraham we're going to go
[1:08:15] out with a great substance Hallelujah so
[1:08:18] he kept cutting until it was done and he
[1:08:21] walked out exactly as the prophecy was
[1:08:23] promised it was fulfilled hallah why
[1:08:26] because he had he had the sword of the
[1:08:28] spirit I mean Micah would be invited to
[1:08:31] a meeting there was two kings Ahab and
[1:08:33] Jehoshaphat were the Kings and you know
[1:08:35] they were they had uh Ahab had 400
[1:08:38] Israelite prophets and they were
[1:08:40] inspired you know you know jeh
[1:08:42] Jehoshaphat said you know let's inquire
[1:08:45] of the Lord you know if we should go
[1:08:46] retake ramoth Gilead and so you know
[1:08:49] Ahab says yeah I got I got 400 trained
[1:08:51] preachers they're real good prophets and
[1:08:54] they got up and they just started
[1:08:55] preaching they they had a real great
[1:08:57] what they thought was a revival time
[1:08:59] we're going to get the land they got so
[1:09:00] enthus there was an anointing Came Upon
[1:09:02] them and the leader of the organization
[1:09:05] made two horns and said by these you'll
[1:09:06] push the syrians out of the country and
[1:09:08] then so now but you see they didn't have
[1:09:10] the sword of the spirit yeah they had an
[1:09:12] intellectual understanding they had an
[1:09:14] emotion they had a nice idea and even
[1:09:17] scripturally ramoth gillad did belong to
[1:09:19] Israel but you see now prophecy there
[1:09:22] was a prophecy had to be fulfilled of RA
[1:09:24] of Ahab dying in battle and then so je
[1:09:28] Jehoshaphat heard the preaching saw the
[1:09:30] music saw the church service he says
[1:09:32] this is all fine but do you have one
[1:09:34] more imagine the look on ahab's face
[1:09:37] thought what are you one more this is
[1:09:40] 400 man what more do you need but do you
[1:09:42] have one more and Ahab says yeah I got
[1:09:44] one but I I hate him he always speaking
[1:09:47] evil against me this man's got the sword
[1:09:49] of the spirit I don't like him too well
[1:09:52] and Jehoshaphat said uh just go get him
[1:09:55] so now here comes here comes the
[1:09:57] ministerial delegation to Mah says
[1:09:59] listen Mah you've been out of Fellowship
[1:10:02] a long time you want to come back I'll
[1:10:05] tell you what's been happening in the
[1:10:06] meeting you've be watching the live
[1:10:07] stream we've been having a big time if
[1:10:09] you want to be accepted cuz we like you
[1:10:11] m you're a real good guy you're just
[1:10:12] straight down the road and we appreciate
[1:10:14] that we need the dogmatic type around
[1:10:16] here but you've got to say what we say
[1:10:19] now you can't say that to someone who's
[1:10:20] got the sword of the spirit you cannot
[1:10:22] say that to someone who's got the
[1:10:23] inspiration of the word you can not say
[1:10:25] compromise just to be part of the group
[1:10:27] no he took that s the spirit and he cut
[1:10:30] through he cut through peer pressure he
[1:10:32] cut through intimidation he cut through
[1:10:34] the you're not welcome here anymore he
[1:10:36] cut through all those things because why
[1:10:39] he knew the Prophecies of Elijah and he
[1:10:42] realized the Prophecies of Elijah are
[1:10:44] going to happen in this season they will
[1:10:47] be fulfilled and that was the sword of
[1:10:49] the spirit amen he received the
[1:10:50] inspiration of those prophecies so he
[1:10:52] said well I'll only say what God puts in
[1:10:54] my mouth that's it so he went prayed
[1:10:58] took it before the Lord and he used the
[1:11:01] inspiration of the word struck him he
[1:11:03] picked up that sword cuz he saw the
[1:11:05] Prophecies of Elijah and said no what
[1:11:07] they say is not matching this see he
[1:11:11] used it to cut through the nearly right
[1:11:14] and found it was completely wrong can we
[1:11:16] do that today can we cut through popular
[1:11:19] opinion hallelujah what everyone else is
[1:11:21] doing and and he came before Ahab he
[1:11:25] said I said go on up the Lord's with you
[1:11:27] he must said it real sarcastically cuz
[1:11:29] Ahab said to to Jehoshaphat don't you
[1:11:32] see he was prophesies against me and
[1:11:34] Maki said I see Israel scattered like
[1:11:37] sheep without a Shepherd then Ahab said
[1:11:39] if take him and feed him the water of a
[1:11:42] bread of sorrow and give him the water
[1:11:43] of Sorrow put him in the inner prison
[1:11:45] Mah said if you ever return God didn't
[1:11:47] speak to me but he had the sword of the
[1:11:49] spirit see and that sword of the spirit
[1:11:52] caused him to match his
[1:11:54] inspiration with with the
[1:11:56] word he cut

[1:12:14] Elijah amen I trust we can stand with
[1:12:17] the prophecy of Elijah in this day amen
[1:12:20] hallu amen we got to realize that the
[1:12:22] end time message meets end time

[1:15:03] wickedly against the Covenant shall
[1:15:05] corrupt shall he corrupt by flatteries
[1:15:07] but the people that know their God shall
[1:15:09] be strong and do exploits amen so if you
[1:15:12] know you're God you're strong that's why
[1:15:14] he say let the weak say I'm strong amen
[1:15:17] and they shall do exploits what exploits
[1:15:19] standing out to the battlefield anyone
[1:15:21] can hide in a trench anyone can camp
[1:15:23] behind a tree and just wait it out but
[1:15:25] the hero really goes out to the front
[1:15:27] amen see if you receive the inspiration
[1:15:29] of the word amen you realize the victory
[1:15:31] is already won but you've got to step
[1:15:33] and possess that Victory amen like Caleb
[1:15:36] and Joshua those ones they didn't just
[1:15:37] sit on the other side of the Jordan say
[1:15:39] well God clear the place out you've
[1:15:41] given it to us clear it out no they went
[1:15:44] and possessed they had to go fight every
[1:15:46] battle but they had the Revelation the
[1:15:48] whole Land is Our hallelujah amen and
[1:15:51] when the enemy came in they didn't quit
[1:15:53] they just attacked they charged see our
[1:15:56] armor does not have any armor on the
[1:15:58] back we have a breastplate which covers
[1:16:00] the front The Shield is for the front
[1:16:03] amen the helmet right but there's
[1:16:05] nothing on the back why cuz we're not
[1:16:06] here to retreat we're here to stand
[1:16:09] we're here to March forward we're here
[1:16:10] to charge amen that if you're in a
[1:16:12] battle say Lord give me the inspiration
[1:16:14] of your word for this battle Inspire to
[1:16:18] me Lord what you would have me do in
[1:16:19] this battle amen you see you see David
[1:16:23] David had the inspiration of the word he
[1:16:24] had the sword of the spirit that when he
[1:16:26] fought Goliath he says he says God's
[1:16:28] given me a bear and a lion you're an
[1:16:30] uncircumcised Philistine I have a
[1:16:33] covenant with God see he just asks a
[1:16:34] question he doesn't even when he's
[1:16:36] talking to Israel he doesn't talk about
[1:16:38] how big Goliath is he says this guy has
[1:16:41] no Covenant with God why are you worried
[1:16:44] about this guy who has no Covenant with
[1:16:46] God our God made heavens and earth Our
[1:16:48] God spoke to Abraham Our God spoke to
[1:16:50] Moses Our God spoke to Joshua our God is
[1:16:53] still God he speaks to Samuel he still
[1:16:55] anoints I've received it amen I've had
[1:16:57] the experience I have a covenant with
[1:16:59] God why are you putting up with this guy
[1:17:02] he has no promise with God he's got
[1:17:04] nothing he's just got his own human
[1:17:06] ability what a failure that turned out
[1:17:08] to be am mean because a small little
[1:17:10] Ruddy boy was just a shepherd with a
[1:17:12] sling amen had the sword of the spirit
[1:17:14] and cut through that thing and rallied
[1:17:16] all of Israel they won a great Victory
[1:17:18] amen and then every time David went to
[1:17:20] battle he didn't just say well I'll do
[1:17:21] the same thing
[1:17:22] again that was I think the last time he
[1:17:25] used a sling he picked up a sword that's
[1:17:27] it and then one time he just went and
[1:17:28] attacked the Philistines other time he
[1:17:30] was waiting by the mulbury bushes
[1:17:32] praying asking God what should we do he
[1:17:34] says when you hear the sound of a going
[1:17:36] rise up and slay your enemy amen so what
[1:17:39] he had the sword of the spirit that he
[1:17:40] could he could step into the battle at
[1:17:42] the right time Hallelujah does that mean
[1:17:45] he put up with the devil when he was
[1:17:46] there no he saw his enemy we can't just
[1:17:49] go like this we don't have ostrich Faith
[1:17:52] oh he'll go away he won't go away oh
[1:17:54] he'll just move on he'll get bored no he
[1:17:56] won't get
[1:17:57] bored God needs you to stand up amen and
[1:18:01] take the word for yourself the Lord and
[1:18:03] slay the
[1:18:05] enemy
[1:18:07] amen you say well my god is so big and
[1:18:09] mighty but you see he needs human beings
[1:18:12] to work through God works through men
[1:18:15] yes God works through his body when I
[1:18:17] say men I mean men and woman okay God
[1:18:20] works through people and he needs people
[1:18:23] who are willing to give themselves on
[1:18:24] the day of
[1:18:27] battle
[1:18:29] see that's what makes Satan mad that's
[1:18:32] what shakes them when the Church of
[1:18:34] Jesus Christ only knew who they were
[1:18:36] brother I'm now you say I know there's
[1:18:38] nothing impossible with God he said
[1:18:41] there's nothing impossible to you cu the
[1:18:43] Bible says all things are possible to
[1:18:45] them that believe amen right so it's and
[1:18:48] that's what makes the devil mad when you
[1:18:50] realize there is nothing impossible with
[1:18:53] me cuz I'm a Believer
[1:18:55] God can do whatever he wants through
[1:18:57] me amen God can live however he wants
[1:19:00] whatever he wants to do when he wants to
[1:19:01] do it he can do it through me amen amen
[1:19:03] you see amen that changes the subject
[1:19:05] doesn't it you say well there's nothing
[1:19:06] impossible to God he said there's
[1:19:08] nothing impossible with you whatsoever
[1:19:10] things you desire When you pray believe
[1:19:12] you receive it and you shall have it
[1:19:13] amen you see we have a full word today
[1:19:17] amen God has fully unveiled himself in
[1:19:19] this day like he did when he came here
[1:19:21] the first time in a body of Flesh right
[1:19:23] he took a redeemed son he took a sinner
[1:19:26] saved by grace brother Braham manifested
[1:19:28] himself through it to prove the power of
[1:19:30] the Cross right and remember the angel
[1:19:33] of the Lord told him if you can get the
[1:19:35] people to believe you nothing will stand
[1:19:37] before your prayer not even cancer and
[1:19:39] brother brah was was the one who said
[1:19:40] not even cancer because it was the big
[1:19:42] enemy of the day still is a big enemy
[1:19:45] but now to me that same commission is
[1:19:48] still on you and I we're going to
[1:19:51] realize oh we need the prophet to come
[1:19:52] back he will come back but our body will
[1:19:54] be changed to meet with him to meet the
[1:19:56] Lord in the air he ain't coming back to
[1:19:57] preach he ain't coming back to fulfill
[1:19:59] the word of God no the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ is upon the Earth to fulfill
[1:20:03] God's Plan of Redemption amen so God
[1:20:06] needs people to work
[1:20:08] through now to me now that changes or
[1:20:12] I'll come to it soon that should change
[1:20:14] our
[1:20:16] attitude because it's really the
[1:20:18] attitude that dictates if you pick up
[1:20:19] the sword of the spirit or
[1:20:22] not that's want I just quit no we're
[1:20:24] here is it
[1:20:33] no he see those prophets had such things
[1:20:35] till they it was hard thing to do they
[1:20:37] didn't want to go out and be scorned at
[1:20:39] they wanted to have fellowship and go in
[1:20:40] with the rest of them go along with the
[1:20:42] Brethren but you see I believe I forget
[1:20:43] what prophet it was actually Jeremiah
[1:20:45] said I don't know this in other words
[1:20:47] but my whole heart will catch fire God
[1:20:49] has spoken I must deliver it whether
[1:20:51] they liked it whether they crucified
[1:20:53] whether they stoned him whatever they
[1:20:55] did God has spoken his heart and he must
[1:20:57] say it not to be different but to be
[1:20:59] obedient obedience is better than
[1:21:01] sacrifice hearkening to the fat of
[1:21:03] Ramsey it was in his heart he must do it
[1:21:06] it was his life he couldn't hold it
[1:21:08] there was something a pulsation that
[1:21:09] pushed him what was that that's the
[1:21:11] inspiration of the word amen uh they
[1:21:15] couldn't bless or curse it God had so
[1:21:17] much complete control of them till he
[1:21:19] was their voice their action Hallelujah
[1:21:22] he says give me a church that so
[1:21:24] completely
[1:21:27] Anointed with God till their every
[1:21:29] action and moves thus sayith the Lord
[1:21:31] walk in that shik of Glory I'll show you
[1:21:33] a messiah anointed one of God standing
[1:21:35] upon the Earth that's a powerful
[1:21:38] statement I mean some a people that so
[1:21:40] completely Anointed with God so it's not
[1:21:43] them living anymore it's God living am
[1:21:45] amen their every action and move is thus
[1:21:47] sayith the Lord what does that mean it's
[1:21:48] the word of God manifested and me they
[1:21:50] walk in that Shak kind of Glory I'll
[1:21:52] show you a messiah upon the Earth
[1:21:55] amen it's not Pie in the Sky friends
[1:21:57] this is what people should see when they
[1:21:58] come in Among Us they should see Messiah
[1:22:00] upon the Earth Christ and his people I
[1:22:02] mean more than just another group they
[1:22:04] should see God and his people once again
[1:22:06] I mean they should see an anointed one
[1:22:08] upon the Earth as a body Hallelujah but
[1:22:11] you see now someone like shamar's
[1:22:14] attitude had to change his attitude
[1:22:17] beforehand would have been app me woes
[1:22:19] me when will God do something about it
[1:22:22] right now attitudes create an atmosphere
[1:22:24] and
[1:22:25] environment amen and it's all about our
[1:22:27] attitude as determines what we'll get
[1:22:29] from the Lord or not see a Roman put a
[1:22:32] rag around his eyes hit him on the head
[1:22:33] with a stick said prophesier tell us who
[1:22:36] hit you prophesy now prophesier God
[1:22:37] don't clown for nobody he never opened
[1:22:40] his mouth no he never said a word he
[1:22:41] didn't feel any virtue but a woman that
[1:22:43] approached him right and touched His
[1:22:45] Garment she got virtue she got her
[1:22:47] desire this other guy was condemned he
[1:22:49] went to hell for it no doubt what's the
[1:22:50] difference it's your attitude amen what
[1:22:53] kind of an environment you create around
[1:22:55] you by your belief or unbelief see
[1:22:59] Shamar had a had a had an environment
[1:23:01] around him that was bad and it wasn't
[1:23:03] the fact that the enemy was taking his
[1:23:05] grain and and and and they were hungry
[1:23:07] and all those things it wasn't that that
[1:23:08] was creating his environment it was his
[1:23:11] attitude because there he was a
[1:23:13] circumcised son of Abraham living in the
[1:23:16] promise Promised Land but his attitude
[1:23:18] was wrong see his attitude towards the
[1:23:20] word was wrong I mean it's sure he maybe
[1:23:22] said yes I believe Jehovah God was there
[1:23:24] with Moses but where is he today see
[1:23:26] that's the wrong attitude his attitude
[1:23:28] should have been he's the same yesterday
[1:23:30] today and forever he's Jehovah of
[1:23:32] Miracles today don't let sickness build
[1:23:34] a complex in your life amen lingering
[1:23:37] problems can build complexes don't let
[1:23:39] them build complexes in your life let
[1:23:42] God live amen doesn't matter how long it
[1:23:44] may T God will come on the scene amen
[1:23:47] Abraham waited 25 years his attitude had
[1:23:50] to be adjusted Sarah's attitude had to
[1:23:52] be adjusted how was it adjusted by a vis
[1:23:54] itation of God himself changed their
[1:23:56] attitudes amen that when Paul would
[1:23:58] write Sarah's obituary and The Heroes of
[1:24:01] Faith of Hebrews 11 it says Sarah judged
[1:24:03] him faithful who had promised why her
[1:24:06] attitude was changed I judge him
[1:24:08] faithful Abraham I judge our God
[1:24:10] Faithful he's no longer just your God
[1:24:12] he's my God he's our God I judge him
[1:24:15] faithful I tell you that would have
[1:24:16] changed the environment in the home am
[1:24:18] mean where before that would have been
[1:24:19] fussing and fighting and trouble and
[1:24:20] strife and maybe a separation maybe
[1:24:22] Abraham didn't testify as much as he
[1:24:24] would to Sarah yeah because of the the
[1:24:27] lingering of the promise seemed just
[1:24:28] just seemed to linger on seemed to be
[1:24:30] many years and nothing was happening and
[1:24:31] the frustration that that can build and
[1:24:33] the complexes that can build but her
[1:24:35] attitude was changed by a visitation of
[1:24:38] Elohim hallelujah amen and so it change
[1:24:40] to the environment that that that that
[1:24:42] they had now was one of
[1:24:45] belief carnality fasting and fighting
[1:24:48] Strife insecurity troubles that's not an
[1:24:51] environment of faith
[1:24:54] if you feel insecure you need to get
[1:24:57] your attitude changed right if you feel
[1:24:59] I don't fit and where I am in the family
[1:25:01] and my upbringing was like this and poor
[1:25:03] me Let Your Attitude Change I mean
[1:25:05] because it's not our upbringing that
[1:25:07] defines us it may mold us a certain way
[1:25:10] but God knows how to break that mold
[1:25:12] bust it open and start building us the
[1:25:13] right way I mean that's why we are the
[1:25:15] clay and he is the Potter sometimes
[1:25:17] there's got to be some radical changes
[1:25:19] go on but praise God for the radical
[1:25:21] changes I mean sometimes our whole shape
[1:25:23] our out look our attitude everything's
[1:25:25] going to completely change but God wants
[1:25:27] to change it that we are a vessel in his
[1:25:29] hand fit for his use amen so don't let
[1:25:32] your your environment be negative and
[1:25:34] fussing and fighting and drama we don't
[1:25:36] need
[1:25:37] drama we don't need drama here we don't
[1:25:39] I'm not a drama person I don't like
[1:25:41] drama why use our mental ability and our
[1:25:44] emotions on negative things why not
[1:25:46] build it on positive things of faith and
[1:25:49] love and security and peace and joy and
[1:25:51] the reality of God Amen why not build
[1:25:53] our lives on that why not have an
[1:25:55] environment of faith in our homes I mean
[1:25:57] where it doesn't matter what's going on
[1:25:59] there can be trouble sickness sorrow
[1:26:00] pain but there's an environment of God's
[1:26:02] more than able I serve the Jehovah of
[1:26:04] Miracles I know he's the same yesterday
[1:26:06] today and forever I know he'll pull
[1:26:08] through like he pulled through last time
[1:26:10] doesn't matter what we're facing amen
[1:26:12] shamgar killed a 600 Philistines Samson
[1:26:15] killed a thousand amen David how many he
[1:26:17] killed the Mighty Men whatever they
[1:26:19] killed why cuz the environment around
[1:26:21] them was
[1:26:22] Faith amen so we can't have a thing
[1:26:25] where we think we're better than another
[1:26:27] family that's a wrong kind of
[1:26:28] environment I mean where it's a fussing
[1:26:30] and fighting and I'm better friends with
[1:26:32] these people and these people that's a
[1:26:33] wrong kind of environment our attitude
[1:26:35] should never be negative towards one

[1:28:51] stepping into that those things that
[1:28:53] people come out of those people get
[1:28:54] really mad cuzz they realize the
[1:28:56] destruction that they were pulled out of
[1:28:59] and some people think well you're just
[1:29:00] being judgmental no we going to pluck
[1:29:02] you out of the fire pluck you out of
[1:29:04] those things it's not worth it amen
[1:29:06] sleeping with the world and committing a

[1:29:13] alcohol don't touch those things there's
[1:29:15] nothing in it that's of any value and if
[1:29:17] your friends are pulling you that way
[1:29:18] I'd say find some new friends I mean
[1:29:21] find people that will actually love you
[1:29:22] and care for you my best drinking
[1:29:25] buddies at University they left me when
[1:29:27] I became a Christian they didn't care
[1:29:29] nothing I didn't even talk anything to
[1:29:30] them they left oh what kind of friends
[1:29:34] are those friends people that could get
[1:29:36] something out of you you know like you
[1:29:38] know there was um where was Paul there
[1:29:40] was somewhere there was the woman that
[1:29:42] had the had the um evil spirit would
[1:29:45] follow them you know Paul and and say
[1:29:48] here comes the people that's going to
[1:29:49] teach us the ways of the most high God
[1:29:51] and it was a woman that people used
[1:29:54] her in that condition to make money cuz
[1:29:57] she's like a fortune teller when she got
[1:30:00] liberated her the men that had her they
[1:30:02] weren't rejoicing they weren't saying
[1:30:04] I'm so thankful she's free of the spirit
[1:30:07] no they got mad they got angry they
[1:30:09] caused a riot because they wanted just
[1:30:12] to use her for their own ends and sadly
[1:30:16] a lot of friendships are people just
[1:30:18] using people for their own ends that's
[1:30:20] how you know if the friendship's wrong
[1:30:22] if if if your friend makes a step closer
[1:30:24] to
[1:30:25] God hallelujah we should not let peer
[1:30:28] pressure even in a church and young
[1:30:29] people hold each other back from serving
[1:30:31] God we should be encouraging one another
[1:30:34] God's real we can have an upper room
[1:30:36] experience we can see the pillar of fire
[1:30:38] we can have visitations of angels we can

[1:30:56] see his word fulfilled in our lives our

[1:31:14] sin if I come to church yes Lord I want
[1:31:16] everything under the blood what kind of
[1:31:18] attitude will that generate coming to
[1:31:20] church that's it Lord you can you can
[1:31:22] call out my whole life
[1:31:24] if you wanted to but if it's under the
[1:31:25] blood God don't see it amen like like
[1:31:28] brother Tim PR tells a testimony of a a
[1:31:31] wife of a deacon in his church she was
[1:31:33] just a young you know you know she was
[1:31:35] in the meetings here with brother Braham

[1:31:42] prayer line she didn't know smoking was
[1:31:44] bad she was just you know and then and
[1:31:46] then a couple of people in front of her
[1:31:48] was standing before the prophet and the
[1:31:50] angel of the Lord was there and
[1:31:51] discerned you're a smoker if you get rid
[1:31:53] of those cigarettes saying you know
[1:31:55] you'll become a real Christian you'll
[1:31:56] get the Holy Ghost and she's there a few
[1:31:59] a few steps behind this man and her
[1:32:03] parents are in the audience and she's
[1:32:05] now stressing out because she's thinking
[1:32:07] within herself when I stand before that
[1:32:10] Prophet God's going to call out I'm
[1:32:12] smoking and not telling my parents I'm
[1:32:13] going to get in big trouble so what did

[1:32:20] forgive me take this from me Lord I'm
[1:32:22] sorry Lord I didn't know it was was evil
[1:32:24] and when she got her turn in front of
[1:32:26] the Prophet the angel of God said
[1:32:29] nothing about the cigarettes why cuz it
[1:32:32] was under the blood God can't see what
[1:32:35] he's covered or actually I could say God
[1:32:38] can't see what you have covered under
[1:32:40] the blood what you have
[1:32:42] confessed hallelujah hallelujah amen

[1:33:51] to um I don't know what number the slide
[1:33:53] is sorry yes here we go but has it come
[1:33:56] here if it is then your whole makeup is
[1:33:59] Christ your
[1:34:01] attitude notice how we lists attitude
[1:34:03] first your attitude your desires your
[1:34:06] appetite your everything is Christ
[1:34:08] yielded resting everything perfect no
[1:34:11] matter how dull it looks or how black it
[1:34:13] looks still it's the same Christ is in
[1:34:15] you he speaks to The Sinner and the
[1:34:17] voice that he would speak to the sinner
[1:34:20] in he speaks to the prostitute in the
[1:34:22] voice he would speak to them in he
[1:34:24] thinks through your mind the very
[1:34:27] thoughts that he speaks through your
[1:34:28] heart the very way that he would if he
[1:34:31] was here on Earth yeah who wants that
[1:34:34] kind of
[1:34:35] life amen that he thinks his thoughts in
[1:34:37] your mind how you speak as if he was
[1:34:41] speaking to the sinner to The Prostitute
[1:34:43] to anyone like that am me brother R
[1:34:45] would tell a story where he was at a
[1:34:46] meeting or between meetings and he went
[1:34:48] into this Diner and it's I think it's in
[1:34:50] the middle of the day and there's
[1:34:51] there's this old woman with blue hair
[1:34:53] and stuff and she drinking with these
[1:34:54] cops and different ones standing around
[1:34:57] a a was it a jukebox you know a music
[1:34:58] machine whatever um I'm sure you can
[1:35:01] find in a museum somewhere you know but
[1:35:04] old school music player right and in his
[1:35:06] heart he starts condemning this woman
[1:35:09] saying what kind how low down and how
[1:35:11] terrible he's just got this righteous
[1:35:13] what he thinks is righteous
[1:35:15] indignation and then the Lord then
[1:35:17] starts and and so he's condemning this
[1:35:19] woman then he begins to see a vision of
[1:35:21] the earth and then around the Earth is a
[1:35:24] circle of blood and then there's the
[1:35:26] Lord Jesus hanging on the cross and then
[1:35:28] and then and then he begins to see black
[1:35:29] streaks coming up from the earth and and
[1:35:31] then and then the Lord is a barrier
[1:35:34] because because above the Lord is the
[1:35:35] holy Throne of God where judgment comes
[1:35:39] and the Lord Jesus is being a barrier
[1:35:40] that all the sin of the earth is
[1:35:42] actually striking him that doesn't hit
[1:35:44] the throne and and and the angel tells
[1:35:47] him in the vision that's your
[1:35:49] sin coming up that's not just even other
[1:35:52] people said that's your sin that's
[1:35:53] coming up but my but the blood of the
[1:35:56] Lord is a
[1:35:57] barrier that it can't get here because
[1:35:59] if it gets up where God is then the
[1:36:01] judgment will come upon you and brother
[1:36:04] Bram said that changed his
[1:36:06] attitude then he went and talked to the
[1:36:08] woman said look can I do you mind if I
[1:36:10] talked to you a bit and he actually
[1:36:12] relays the vision what what he was
[1:36:13] thinking towards her in her in his heart
[1:36:15] and the vision he just saw and then she
[1:36:17] begins to tell her her life story to him
[1:36:21] and how she was once a Christian trouble
[1:36:23] came in now she's like this and you know
[1:36:25] and they have a prayer meeting in that
[1:36:28] Dino and the prophet leads her back to
[1:36:30] the Lord I think the men that were with
[1:36:32] her why because his attitude changed
[1:36:36] that's how God see God can't work
[1:36:38] through a bad attitude God can't work
[1:36:41] through a condescending judgmental
[1:36:43] attitude he can't work through a poor me
[1:36:46] attitude he can't work through those
[1:36:48] things he's got to work through his
[1:36:50] attitude in you amen hallelujah amen it
[1:36:52] can't be our human atude and his
[1:36:54] attitude at the same time it's got to be
[1:36:55] one or the other so I say Lord may it
[1:36:57] just be your attitude amen that we see
[1:37:01] that we see everyone
[1:37:04] in amen see so that's if you're in the
[1:37:06] Shak of Glory this is how you are he say
[1:37:08] I take it myself you I hope you don't
[1:37:10] mind these quotes and we're going to
[1:37:11] wrap up I take it myself I'm actually
[1:37:13] about to close I take it myself before
[1:37:15] God as my judge I put it in the gospel
[1:37:17] work Yonder as I know that on the day
[1:37:20] that I'll have to give an account for my
[1:37:21] stewardship it's given correctly that's
[1:37:23] exactly right cuz I realize I treat the
[1:37:25] people I'm treating God cuz some people
[1:37:27] say well I've got a good attitude
[1:37:28] towards God but do you love your brother
[1:37:31] do you love your sister cuz John said if
[1:37:33] you don't love them you don't love him
[1:37:35] you're living in a
[1:37:36] delusion right so as I treat the people
[1:37:40] I'm treating God just my attitude
[1:37:42] towards you is my attitude towards
[1:37:44] Christ so what's your attitude just do a
[1:37:46] mental check now what's your attitude
[1:37:49] towards everyone amen that's your
[1:37:50] attitude towards your lord
[1:37:53] and your attitude towards me is the same
[1:37:55] thing that's right towards
[1:37:57] Christ I hope our attitude's good I hope
[1:38:01] our attitude towards one another is the
[1:38:02] same attitude Christ has towards you and
[1:38:04] I
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:08] amen see it's we we must have the right
[1:38:12] attitude if you want to use the sword of
[1:38:14] the spirit you got to have the right
[1:38:15] attitude if you want to receive that
[1:38:17] inspiration of God and cutting you got
[1:38:19] to have the right attitude am mean
[1:38:21] people who get caught up and say we
[1:38:22] should run people out of church we
[1:38:24] should run people out of the city can
[1:38:25] can we go down just to down towards um
[1:38:28] uh the next slide early spiritual
[1:38:29] experiences next one down thank you amen
[1:38:32] see brother Bram was having this you uh
[1:38:35] this was when he was referring to when
[1:38:36] he um when when um the pillar of fire
[1:38:39] photograph was taken in Houston Texas
[1:38:42] and there was the man who uh I think it
[1:38:43] was Dr best a Baptist he wanted to run
[1:38:45] brother Bram out of the out of the city
[1:38:48] and um but then notice this he brother B
[1:38:51] says this here he says now he says about
[1:38:53] you know brother Bosworth wanted to
[1:38:55] debate him and brother R said well as
[1:38:57] long as you don't fussed him just debate
[1:38:58] he said fine we'll have a debate and
[1:39:00] brother R said okay you can go do that
[1:39:02] and he said the second day he came out
[1:39:03] this is I think Dr best he says said I
[1:39:06] ought to said said brother Braham which
[1:39:08] is the ey there ought to be run out of
[1:39:09] the city he ought to be the guy to do it
[1:39:11] well that now just to me if you'll
[1:39:13] excuse the expression that showed me the
[1:39:15] man hadn't been to Calvary yet you can
[1:39:19] never you never take a Christian a
[1:39:21] Christian don't take that attitude
[1:39:23] when you're born again you love your
[1:39:25] brother that's right so if you have the
[1:39:27] right see if your attitude is that
[1:39:29] person's a pain in the neck I'm so
[1:39:31] annoyed of that person that family d d
[1:39:33] that's the wrong attitude that attitude
[1:39:36] is not you haven't been to Calvary yet I
[1:39:38] say like the prophet said when you've
[1:39:39] been to Calvary then mercy can be
[1:39:41] extended then God's attitude can be on
[1:39:43] display in your life then you can view
[1:39:45] one another as he views you Hallelujah
[1:39:48] right because those who have never been
[1:39:49] to Calvary have a judgmental
[1:39:51] condescending attitude right it's a
[1:39:53] self-ability attitude the they they want
[1:39:56] to be the big shot I tell you what the
[1:39:58] Holy Ghost takes the big shot out of you
[1:40:01] I me it takes that critical nature out
[1:40:03] of you you cannot have a critical nature
[1:40:04] and have the Holy Ghost living in your
[1:40:06] life that's the nature of a wolf is a
[1:40:08] critical attitude amen but the nature of
[1:40:09] a dove is a loving kind thoughtful
[1:40:11] attitude amen that puts others before
[1:40:14] themselves that actually views the other
[1:40:16] as Christ views them I mean well how
[1:40:18] does Christ view them well he had a joy
[1:40:20] set before him when he went to Calvary
[1:40:22] that was that person that was that
[1:40:24] person you may think rubbish of someone
[1:40:26] that was that person he went for that he
[1:40:28] didn't just go for you he went for them
[1:40:31] amen that was his attitude my joy is
[1:40:34] that person on the other side made in my
[1:40:36] image and Eternity with me forever and
[1:40:39] ever and ever and ever and ever that
[1:40:40] that was his attitude that's why he went
[1:40:43] what's our attitude this morning you
[1:40:46] never cut through any demon power with a
[1:40:47] bad attitude Hallelujah God our lord
[1:40:51] Jesus cut through everything that could
[1:40:52] be cut through yeah he was that
[1:40:55] sword amen it's our attitude or
[1:41:02] approach it's all what it's
[1:41:05] about now the right
[1:41:09] attitude is everything because the right
[1:41:13] attitude ties him with faith I'm now I
[1:41:15] am actually really
[1:41:17] closing the SOP phenician woman had a
[1:41:20] lot of hindrances but her attitude was
[1:41:23] if I just get to Jesus and he speaks my
[1:41:26] daughter's going to be free that was her
[1:41:28] attitude that was her sold out madeup
[1:41:31] attitude her attitude wasn't well I'll
[1:41:33] see what happens or I'll see how I'm
[1:41:35] accepted or surely I will be accepted
[1:41:38] because my case is so bad that was not
[1:41:40] her attitude her attitude was I must get
[1:41:42] to this man he must speak he must speak
[1:41:44] to my situation this is what I need and
[1:41:47] it was according to the word of God so
[1:41:48] that her attitude was right and and and
[1:41:51] and and the disciples tried to discour
[1:41:53] her Jesus himself tried to discourage
[1:41:56] her but he knew the faith that was
[1:41:58] within her amen right he knew the faith
[1:42:02] within her was yielding the sword of the
[1:42:04] spirit if I put it that way it cut
[1:42:06] through all of the obstacles that she
[1:42:08] was going through all the hindrances
