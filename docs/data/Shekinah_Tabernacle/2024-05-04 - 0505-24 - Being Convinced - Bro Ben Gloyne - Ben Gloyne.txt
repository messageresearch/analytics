I'm speaking for brother Andrew uh Donaldson so maybe not that weekend so maybe the following week basically the end of the month we have youth service we'll see how we go anywh who God bless you all good to see you here this morning amen let's go to Matthew 14 trust everyone's happy and well and amen the shock fact is gone it's Mother's Day next Sunday I think everyone's scrambling in their mind to get a gift it's fine anyway I hope not hope you're prepared Matthew 14:24 uh but the here we are so but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw saw him TR walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid amen amen we're just going to read that portion of scripture this morning so if you have a need you want to slip your hand up to the Lord as we go to the Lord in prayer thank you Lord Jesus as you speak Lord 100 billion failures disappear Lord you are so great We Want To Praise Your Name Lord if all creation was made to worship so will we Lord not because out of out of Duty but out of love and Thanksgiving Lord and Lord with such Joy Lord You've redeemed Us by the power of your blood and we're so glad we can gather this morning to worship you in spirit and in truth dear God so we pray that you'll anoint speaker and hearer one more time may your word come alive in our hearts that when we go out of this place may be full of your goodness and joy and Thanksgiving and may we just appreciate you more and may have your way in our lives we want to ask that you'd be with those who couldn't make it Lord we always want to remember them in prayer be their portion too Lord wherever they may be we thank you for this day in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about being being convinced being convinced this morning so uh so here as we look at this opening scripture they were you know there's you can be convinced by many things but when God convinces you that's different than a human convincing so they were at first convinced that Jesus was a spirit but then when Jesus spoke they were convinced that he was wasn't a spirit amen but that he was the uh he was the Lord Jesus that's why after this Peter says if it's you bid me to come walk on the water and Jesus says come so he walked on the water so he was convinced they were convinced that he was a spirit then they were convinced that he was Jesus right so this is where I'm going so now this this word convinced from Webster would tell us is to bring as by argument to belief consent or a course of action and another word that's close to it is to persuade so so B so this is um just some example convinced himself that she was all right and something I could never convince him to read so so in the dictionary a convincing is because of an argument or a list you know something that logically makes right but I want to say when God convinces someone convinces you or I it's not by a logical argument or reasoning it's by Revelation so I just want to just go into this today because I believe I'm looking at a people who are convinced I mean they're not mentally convinced I you I I Pray by the end of the service if you're just humanly convinced cuz Mom says it's good or dad says it's good or well it's nice to be here it goes beyond that convincing and it's god-given convin convincing conv you you just become convinced I'm like stay to make up words this is not working out very well but I pray you're convinced by the Holy Ghost amen that his word is true that it is right and our God is the same yesterday today and forever so now Jesus would ask his disciples in Matthew chapter 16 he would before he would say this uh but whom do you say that I am he would ask his ask them who do men say I am so he's basically asking what are they convinced about about what they see in my life what are they convinced about him and some say you're you know you're Elias or jeremias or one of the pro um you know one of the prophets so that's what that's what what they saw convinced them that he was a prophet raised from the dead but then Jesus asked him but who do you say that I am what are you convinced about here you know what does this what does this mean to you and Peter Simon Peter said um answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen and then so Jesus is going to tell him the source or the reason why he's convinced this way and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven so the one who's convinced you Simon Peter is not you it's not the disciples it's not your culture it's not your background it's not it's not even you convincing yourself it's God in heaven has convinced you that I am the Messiah I am the Fulfillment of every prophecy that would be given of the Messiah I am he and then so and then so um Jesus would say and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it because we got to realize that if you're convinced humanly then the Gates of Hell will prevail against that human argument yes I keep want to say convincing but I don't even know if that yeah yeah it's convincing that's a word a yeah there we go who did English here even yeah but you know if you're convinced humanly then a human can come and convince you out of it right but if God has convinced you then it's all over nothing can move you from that rock of Revelation amen now now Jesus would say this here because we got to realize that Jesus would give a parable and he'd speak about because um you know if someone is fully convinced they'll go all the way if people are just convinced humanly then they will the first sign of trouble or the first part of doubt would start to come in it will it will degrade that foundation and they'll begin to question what they're doing is right but if they're convinced they can see it's going to happen it's been revealed to them it's going to happen then nothing is going to stop them so he says here if any man come to and hate not his um father and mother and his wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay for his own life all and his own life also he cannot be my disciple now that word hate actually means to love less okay it doesn't mean we get all angry I hate you Mom and Dad I hate you siblings and no it's not what he meaning you you got to love your own self and all of your all of your um you know family you got to love everything less than him right because if you love yourself more you cannot be his disciple you cannot follow him but if you if you love him more than everything else then you can then you can be his disciple amen and whosoever do not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it let happily after Heath laid the foundation is not able to finish it all that beholdeth it begin to mock him so someone who's just humanly convinced say yeah I can do that yeah that makes sense yeah this can all come into being and but then but then as time goes on then the proof of that conviction or that you know if they're really convinced by God or man will become to be a parent but if they're convinced that yes it's going to happen it's it's a revelation they say it's going to happen it comes into manifestation it's like Elijah was n humanly convinced I need to call Ahab and the prophets of Baal to mount carel you know let's just you I'm sick of this let's just end this he wasn't convinced by his own mind and his own righteous indignation no he was convinced by God call them to Mount Carmel do what I tell you to do he was convinced and when he was convinced all the noise the prophets of Baal all the hooa they did all the cutting themselves the dancing the music the whatever they did did not move him one bit am mean because he was convinced by God what God showed him was going to come into manifest amen and it should be the same thing with you and I friends we should be so convinced that this word is true amen we should be so convinced that Beyond trouble beyond all whatever is going on in life his word is true he's more than able to fulfill it amen we should be thoroughly convinced hallelujah hallelujah I trust I am I mean I mean I trust you are rather saying this man began to build and was not able to finish it or what king going to make war against another king sth not down first and consult whether he's able with with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the others is um while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth a an ambassage and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise who whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple so we've got to consider these things that you know we can't just start saying yes it's mentally true no we're to be convinced by the holy ghost that he's more than able to fulfill his word I mean cuz you've got to see now that when when when man tries to fulfill the word in his own ability he's only convinced he can do it and that never comes to any anything good right now Moses Moses was convinced humanly that he was the deliverer right he he heard the supernatural testimony of his parents you know where Abraham was praying and you know brother BR would dramatize it how you know amram his father was so burdened you know they had to come the deliverer and he would he would be beaten and and everything in the fields working it'd come out at night go on the top of his Housetop and cry out to Jehovah God that you know calling on him when you know when are you going to send this promise this this promise deliverer that you told Abraham that we're going to come out of this place with a mighty hand and time is approaching and when's this going to happen and amram would I mean I mean joked his wife would tell him you know amran you don't have to pray someone else can pray but he was so burned he said but but but what if no one else does I got to pray through cuz God he was convinced that it was this the season of the Fulfillment of that prophecy he was convinced amen then by faith they realized when they had that when they had Moses he was the promised son Hallelujah so and we know the story Moses was put in that basket you know went down the Nile and came to came to um came to um what do you call it um Pharaoh's daughter's Palace and all those things was raised in the palace and you know so he so Moses was convinced that he was the deliver but just humanly you see so when someone is just humanly convinced they try with human ways to try and fulfill it now we read here that you know Moses he came to a point in his life where where um you know he came to look out upon the um you know people of Israel he saw a Egyptian slave master was beating one of his Hebrew brothers and he looked around no one was no one was around and he and he and he killed the Egyptian and hit him in the sand and then now the second day he went out and behold two men of the Hebrews strove to and he said to the one that did wrong wherefore smartest thou thy fellow now you got to think about this Moses was raised in Pharaoh's Palace he could have been the next Pharaoh so he knew all the Judgment he knew how to you know give judgment and all these different things so he thought humanly because he was convinced humanly I can do the job and so how he tried to do the job was trying because he thought in his mind if I Sidle this fight then they'll say this man is really really knows what he's on about then he'll then they'll get under his influence and then eventually all of is Isel will come under his influence and then he'll say look boys this is what we need to do let's rise up you I know where all the weapons are and then we can start a revolution and we will liberate ourselves from Egypt but what did it do it caused one dead Egyptian that what his him being convinced humanly that he could fulfill the word just caused one dead Egyptian and him running at the first sign of trouble see if we are humanly convinced that all we need is human ability everything we do will come to nothing right but if we are convinced this is God then God will fulfill his word then God will manifest the promise right because Moses Moses would run as as as he you know because um he he realized by the two uh Hebrews speaking that you know Pharaoh is going to know about this that I killed an Egyptian and he ran he ran from he ran into the land of Midian and he came to a place where he he you know he married um the the the chief of midian's daughter Zapora and it says here and Moses was content to dwell with the man so he was content and that word content means um through the idea of mental weakness it means properly to yield so he knew he was the promised son to deliver but then because it was just he was just convinced humanly then he ran from trouble and then he and then he just he just he just basically sat back and said well this is my lot now I'm just going to be a Shepherd for my father-in-law I'm going to be away from my people away from the promise I'm just going to make this little safety zone of a life this comfort zone and I'm going to stay in this comfort zone and everything's going to be just fine this but but this wasn't his portion am mean because you got to realize that you know he was convinced now he was mentally convinced he could do it but then when trouble came and it didn't come out the way he thought it should come then he became convinced he's not the deliverer and he became convinced that his own failures brought him this way why cuz he's TR trusting in himself are you following me maybe we're just walking along today but you know I just want you to think about these things because what are you convinced by are you convinced by your upbringing convinced by the church convinced by your own ability or are you convinced by God that this is his word I mean to Moses actions thought he was he was convinced by his own failures now let's just look isn't it amazing when God would because everything that Moses lacked the burning bush had yes right right so the one that gave the promise was going to be the one that would fulfill the promise but he had to be convinced by God himself that he had been sent now now here he was now and and Moses it's amazing when you read through the account when when when when God Appears to him in the burning bush all Moses gives is excuses all he gives is excuses but he knew down in his heart he was the one to fulfill the word he knew he was but thing is he cont he let's just go back to that word again see and but he was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses Zapora his daughter so he was so content with living this little comfort zone of a life yet circumcised son of Abraham yet a Believer all right but he was content to live in this little safety zone that when God came and spoke to him in the burning bush all he could give was excuses about why he couldn't fulfill it why CU he was still convinced it would have to be his own human ability that could fulfill it right he had to surrender to God that God was going to come and do it and how many people say yes I'm going to I'm going to be an overcomer yes I'm going to be the bride of Christ yes I'm going to fulfill the word but they convinced it's their own ability this is not our own ability right I trust you have come that that's why we can say thank you God for the scars because scars can come because we it's like Moses had a lot of scars he had regret from killing that man and trying to do it his own self and look he's just a failure no doubt that haunted him for 40 years and then and then but then he built a complex around it that when God came his way he says look at this he says look behold thou not believe me he was the one who gave the promise had manifested himself to him and he said no no no they're not going to believe me you know they won't hearken to my voice for they'll say the god that the Lord ha not appeared unto thee and then if you keep reading down it says Moses said unto the Lord oh Lord I am not eloquent neither here um here to for nor nor since thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I'm slow of speech and of a slow tongue so he's just giving excuses why he can't do it isn't that interesting yeah I thought you know but why because he's still being convinced by his own ability he was convinced his own self could not fulfill it and that's why actually God just got anointed him saying come on man who made the mouth to speak who made your vocal cords who made you I've made you to fulfill This Promise Moses I made you to fulfill this prophecy why are you doubting why are you looking at yourself why you look at your own problems and your own regret and your own past look into my word look into me because I am what you lack amen I am here to convince you that you're here to fulfill this word amen amen it's the same thing friends with you and I we we I trust we're convinced this message is for us I can I trust we are convinced the Rapture is for us I trust we're convinced that we these bodies are going to be changed amen I trust that we are convinced that the blood of Jesus Christ is more than enough sir am to take away all sin all sorrow all guilt all shame it's all gone father hallelujah amen see he had a even brother Bram was speaking about a brother um he said you know um uh brother brother Rell here he says now he says I'm going to ask a dear friend of mine a young Minister sitting out here he had a kind of a complex and he and his little wife used to come to my house all the time and he' just sit around and he wouldn't talk and he just asked one question brother Braham what what do you think the Lord uh what do you think the Lord has called me to the ministry and I saw the potentials of this young man from A Fine Bible Institution but he just lacked like Moses with all of his training what Moses lacked the burning bush had that's what brother Adell lacked is what the burning bush had and one day it caught fire amen like Moses he caught fire amen fire spreads Fire's looking for fuel amen fire is looking for something to ignite amen and a real genuine sincere heart it'll your flame amen if you open your heart and let God in amen Moses was trying to put up all kind of walls of excuses but God didn't relent amen and you'll hear message after message sermon after sermon song after song we say come unto me my child I'll give you rest I'll give you peace I'll take your frustration from you I'll take your annoyance from you I'll take your bug beard away I will reveal yourself I will reveal myself to you but you've got to lead them in amen hallelujah amen how many people try and come to God on their own terms you to come to God on his terms amen but you see you see so Moses everything he lacked the burning bush had amen and everything we lack the pillar of fire possesses amen and we know that Pillar of Fire is present Among Us he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you where where the true word is preached the pillar fire is in attendance amen and what I love about it is God told Moses take your staff what's in your hand he throws it on the ground amen it became a serpent he ran away from it and God says pick it up by the by by the tail picks up turns into a staff again take your hand put it into your bosom pull it out becomes lepos put it back it becomes normal and you know the amazing thing is what God did to him in secret he manifested openly amen so the testimony wasn't just yes I had this time with God but God brought that testimony into the public am mean to prove what God had convinced him with was real amen so you see the fruit of the fruit of the commission became manifested in the palace amen what Moses went into the palace threw a staff down it became a cobra or a snake and he took it by a tail and it became normal again ien so the fruit that God promised would be manifested became manifested amen it's it's the same thing when you're convinced this word is Right amen you will have joy you will have peace you will have love you will have faith amen now you may be a lot of lot of trouble in your mind this morning put that to one side amen God has called you to manifest this word amen you were convinced many years ago it's right it's still right but the devil wants to try and derail you amen from stop you to try and think now was my convin what am I actually convinced what made you start in the first place what made you start in the first place why are you still here you say I don't feel like being here but yet you're here why are you here God's called you here God's brought you here God wants to show you what you're convinced by as not man you weren't influenced by family you weren't influenced by a nice idea no God came one day yes my spoke to you and say this is me amen cuz Moses could have sat there for another 40 years and said well what what about this what about that but then God came his way and said no I'm going to convince you and I'm going to convince you and I'm going to prove it amen hallelujah so what happens now the the evidence that we're convinced is God Lives the evidence is that we believe his word amen the evidence is that we take him at his word maybe I'm maybe simplifying things too much but you got to realize that we're we're a convinced people hallelujah now if you've got faith that's ridiculous to everyone but God and the fellow that's got it amen faith is a finds a source that others can't see amen Moses had a source you know when he walked into Egypt you know because what happened God commissioned him at the burning bush he became convinced by God it was the season was the time and he was the right man for the job he became a s he he became a surrendered human vessel to the commission am mean that's what if you're really convinced you become surrendered amen you don't try and do it in your own if you're convinced up here you do it with this but if you're really convinced in here you let God do it amen you let God fulfill his word so now Moses you got his two young got his wife put put them on a mule and went down into Egypt went through the Customs you know filled out the customs declaration form purpose of visit he he saw visiting relatives yes that's true business yeah I'm definitely on business and what about other he put one man Invasion maybe gave it to to the Customs guy thought crazy old man stamped his passport let him go through thing is he did it what are you doing Moses where are you going I'm invading Egypt maybe a lot of people thought he was a crazy man he wasn't a crazy man he found a source that that amen he found a source amen that others could not see but he saw it amen cuz he be to he realized the god that made him in the burning bush didn't leave him there amen but went before him went with him went in him amen that when he went into um Pharaoh's Palace and he said let let my people go that was God speaking it was the one who gave the conv you know convinced Moses spoke through Moses and said let my people go amen so Moses Moses was thoroughly convinced that God is here to do it yes sir he was thoroughly convinced God is here to fulfill his word in his life amen and I trust you are thoroughly convinced this morning God is more than able to do it the devil try and push you and push you saying you can't do it you've done too much you've done too much wrong no when he speaks 100 billion failures disappear we're all failures friends we were born failures we fail every day but he's the unfailing one if we keep our confidence in him amen we may fail we'll hey I'm sorry folks we'll fail again amen amen I'm sorry but he does not fail amen we may have lost a lot of battles but we won't lose the war amen like General Patton said one day he he had lost a couple of battles and you know you know he said you he's calling for new recruits fresh men to send to the front and you know he'd say give me men don't give me boys you know give me give me men with courage you know and you know people are saying yeah but you're losing these War you you're losing these battles he said but I haven't lost the war you know eisenh how would say you know you put a shell in the gun you fire it and maybe it doesn't even go off you don't throw it down and quit you put that shell out you put another shell in and you fire until it hits home amen it's like prayer amen sometimes you feel well it's just there's just no point put another shell in the gun I mean you want to change the atmosphere in your life put on another song I mean think on another scripture put another shell in the gun it'll fire amen it'll hit its Target amen don't sit there saying what's wrong with the weapon no the weapon works perfectly amen but keep firing until you get in condition that God can take over amen that's what we need this morning friends amen is to allow God to take over amen Moses put the shell in the gun of his own ability it just popped and did nothing but when he surrendered when he became convinced amen nothing could stop him you think about it one the the small smallest man in Pharaoh's Army could have killed him with a spear but nothing could stop him cuz he was convinced amen so when he went in before Pharaoh's Court he knew what it was like to be there he knew the pomp he knew the authority that Pharaoh had one word from Pharaoh kill that man take him out execute him it was done but he was Fearless why cuz he was convinced I mean he wasn't intimidated by Pharaoh in his Palace no cuz he was convinced that God could do it I mean so when he went in there he said let my people go and Pharaoh said no he says well God's going to plague you until you you have to let them go why cuz God had already given them the promise that they were going to be brought out with a mighty hand with great substance amen so Moses knew that was going to happen cuz he was convinced the one who gave the promise is the one who's going to fulfill the promise amen so it doesn't matter what opposition he came against God's going to fulfill it are we convinced this morning are we convinced this word is true are we convinced that God is able to meet every situation I mean are we convinced that he can do say well it seems impossible Our God works in the impossible am mean our God works you look at you look at Enoch it was it was impossible for Enoch to walk with God and be taken in his own ability but God showed Enoch I'm going to show you something impossible today I'm going to use you to show that when people walk with me I'm going to take them in a Rapture amen amen it was impossible for Noah hey he could have built a boat people can build boats but to build at the right dimensions you know that vot architecturally Naval Architects say the dimensions of the Ark are perfect for stability the ratio of length and width and height it's perfect because all it needed to do was float it wasn't winning the America's Cup didn't have to hydrofoil it just had to survive right you know so so it it was really you know so yeah sure he could have made a boat but to make it that perfectly and get all the animals there how did they go round them up no God LED them God anointed them to walk into that Ark maybe it took them a few Generations like the tortois or I don't know how long that took but they started walking eventually they started migrating amen there was a pull towards the ark it's the same thing with you and I friends there's a pull towards Christ amen it may take us a while but we're on our way we're walking amen if you're in it's wonderful if you're on your way don't stop don't stop saying no Lord I want Total Victory I want Total I want Total Joy I want Total peace I want to be totally in not just walking up the ramp not just seeing it yes I see the Lord is true and I see he's real no step into him give your life to him baptized in his name amen hallelujah hallelujah so you see now so that was impossible Moses impossible he tried it it failed God anointed him it worked the Red Sea you know scientists come up with all kind of excuses how it happened no God caused a wind to blow and they walked on dry ground who's ever walked even in a lake or a river and you just like your foot your legs half in the mud they walked on dry ground that's right who did that God did that how did he do it he did it moisture go down he just did this you know impossible and then at the right time they're all over and the thing closes on Pharaoh Hallelujah they got fed in the wilderness by Mana all these things impossible things David against Goliath you say well that was just a statistical anomaly of a Shepherd boy hitting a hitting a champion in the head with a with a sling no that was God anointed that rock David was convinced amen that he was a circumcised son of Abraham God had made a covenant with him he was living in his Promised Land amen he was living in his inheritance he was an adopted son of God and this enemy came on his ground and he just realized well God said one will chase a th two will chase 10,000 what is this uncircumcised Philistine compared to the armies of the Living God he was convinced I mean Saul and his men were were only humanly convinced they thought yes it can be done but they didn't know it could be done I mean but David knew it could be done cuz he was convinced that God could do am me so when when that sling when he released that stone amen God anointed that stone and it went straight to the killing Place amen and he fell on his head and even David said I'm going to cut your head off he had no sword am mean but but Goliath brought his own sword am mean it shows you that the devil actually sets himself up for failure I mean as soon as he you know reveals himself you know devil you just told me how I can kill you I mean if you're feeling depressed we realize that's a spirit of depression amen if you're feeling just rebellious you don't want to be here don't want to follow God that's a spirit of rebellion trying to get you you got to realize the devil's just exposed himself now you can stand against that thing now you can't expose that thing amen like the Bible says confess your faults one to another amen what is that doing you are actually stepping out from being the devil's human shield yeah shoot this guy it Lor it's good we need to expose Satan amen we need to expose him sometimes we can't get in words what are we facing it's like God give give me a name just like some sometimes well it's it's good way to go to the doctor but you know you get diagnosed with something praise the lord we we now have a name amen now we can pray against this thing praise the lord well do you need to get a name not necessarily but it's nice to know who you're hunting amen it's nice to know what trophies you're going to put on your wall of God's grace don't you think so like what have you shot Maria you say what have you shot and you say well I've shot this thing it wouldn't mean much to me but the hunters here about wow that's incredible why cuz there's a name to it amen it's like you know it's like David's carrying Goliath's head you know and if he said if he said uh you know people say who head you dragging David oh just a Philistine that wouldn't mean too much they said this is Goliath of gath and the reputation of that guy who's now dead would have been wow you killed him yeah cuz I'm con I was convinced I was convinced that God could do it and he did it amen I've got the evidence praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord L amen I trust no I believe we're convinced amen amen see but without faith it's impossible to please him so with faith it's impossible not to please him so so if so if God has revealed himself to you which is Faith it's impossible for you not to please him for he that cometh to God must must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so if you're convinced see where's your source of strength this morning what is your source of strength my strength Cometh From The Lord amen amen amen not social media not scrolling not not entertainment not no no my Help Cometh From The Lord my strength is in him amen so we're got to realize he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him because when you seek him with all your heart you shall find him the Bible says it's not you might you will hallelujah hallelujah you say well I tried once upon a time put another shell in the gun put another shell in the gun amen don't be don't be discouraged that Devil Wants You discouraged but I pray God encourage you this morning amen like the saraph phenician woman who had a had a daughter that was grievously vexed with the devil she was convinced that this man Jesus of Nazareth could could set her daughter free he she was thoroughly convinced not in her head but in her heart so then she started to go and the deci you know she you know she starts calling you know uh son of man have mercy on me and all these things and the disciples even saying she's calling after us and then but then of course she's calling after the Lord but then the Lord would say to her you know or or to the disciples tell her you know I'm not sent to Gentiles I'm not sent so what happened her first prayer seemed to come back in her face but she was convinced she was convinced this man had the ability to free her daughter because she was convinced in here she did not take a no for an answer she did not she did not settle for well I guess that didn't work she did not allow anything to offend her she no she was convinced and then you know and then and then he would say well you know it's not meat to give the you know you know the bread to the bread to the dogs but she said yay Lord true but even the dogs get the crumbs under the table and he said you're really convinced great is your faith Hallelujah so she didn't stop until she got what she needed amen he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him are you convinced this morning he say well where is he that I can I can talk to him like that Faith contacts him he's the high priest you touched by the feeling of your infirmity amen he's not some distant place you know it took it was her faith that touched Jesus it wasn't her words it was her faith amen blind bmas was convinced that this Jesus of Nazareth was the same one or greater than the prophets that his mom told him about sitting by the wall of Jericho there he became convinced that's why he would holler out son of son of David have mercy on me and it was not it wasn't his his the audible sound of his voice that stopped Jesus it was his faith you know the people told him be quiet sit still you're causing trouble shush shush Bas you just gone crazy well no he was convinced amen he was convinced so when the devil when the devil tells you to shut up no you're you're you've been convinced you be greater than the devil trying to tell you to shut up when he says no don't say Amen don't enter in don't sing don't raise your hands it's just like that mob telling blind b m to be quiet yeah he said no no I'm convinced that the Lord Jesus as he passes by this way amen I can I can cause him to stand still amen that I can draw from him what I have need of Hallelujah why cuz I'm convinced that his word has the ability amen has the power hallelujah amen to do what it said it would do Hallelujah but you see human humanly being convinced changes I'm just going back to this you know they would they would cry in Egypt Israel would because of the reason of their task Masters and they you know they would cry you know you know they were they were convinced that this is not how they should be they're not meant to be slaves they were convinced but they are just humanly convinced because when they came to when they came to be delivered they begin to complain we should be convinced that depression anxiety doubt unbelief skepticism pessimism cynicism depression none of those things are our portion they are not ours they do not belong to you they should never belong to you the devil wants you to make you think they're yours but they're not yours pain hurt regret guilt shame it's not our portion no the Lord Jesus died that we'd be free of all those things but you've got to be convinced that his blood is more than enough amen so even they would just humanly convinced because when they came by the Red Sea you think about it they're about to see the greatest thing they had ever seen up to that point why because their enemy that was pursuing them was going to die so that enemy could not pursue them anymore sure it's one thing to leave Egypt it's another thing for Egypt not be able to pursue you amen so here they were and they cried out they said were there no graves in Egypt that thou has taken us to die in the wilderness where wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt so basically what have you done to us God came and called them out that's what God had done that's what God had used Moses for you know but but W they Graves why have you taken us to die here it was better to die in Egypt really in Egypt their their their baby boys were thrown to the crocodiles they were used as just they they were treated Less in Pharaoh's horses if they died they died the Egyptians didn't care about them they were abused and used and all kinds of things and they got to a point where they said actually it's better for us to be back there that's a but you see this is just being convinced in here because trouble had came their way amen is this not the word we did tell in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it been better for us to serve the Egyptians that than that we should die in the wilderness I tell you friends I'd rather die delivered than die slave I would rather die amen a free man than a slave man amen so I'd rather die serving God than serving some depression some anxiety some trouble some doubt in my mind some culture something going on in the world I'd rather die a free man serving God any day amen then then be bound in the world Lord but you see and then what happened Moses said stand still and you know fear not and stand still you shall see the salvation of the Lord what happened the Red Sea opened up they walk through on dry ground the Egyptians tried to follow them and they drowned amen and God was see they were complaining just before they were about to see their enemy killed Amen to this enemy that would come back day after day and afflict them trouble them in their mind trouble them beat them all these things thing was going to be destroyed that would never come back again Hallelujah that's why they danced on the danced on the other side of the bank cuz they saw their enemy dead amen and when you come through the blood of Jesus Christ amen every enemy that's bothered you is drowned in the blood of Jesus Christ and you can do a victory dance Amen on the other side saying hallelujah I've been delivered I've been delivered I've been delivered amen A Hallelujah isn't that right maybe we should break out the tambourine a bit more amen hallelujah maybe we should go back to our Red Sea experience and rejoice about that a bit more amen don't you like to go down memory lane sometimes and remember where God has taken you from Hallelujah to put your joy joy shoes on Amen Hallelujah even see now when the spies when the when the 12 Spies came back when they came back from from the promised land Moses sent them out you know it took two men to carry a big bunch of grapes and they brought they brought evidence of the land that it was a land flowing with milk and honey yes the fruit was sweet amen it was it was an amazing amazing land it was exactly as God told us it would be it wasn't a land flowing with sand and I don't know it was milk and honey exactly as God said of the streams the Brooks the all those things the plenteous places to grow fruit and and and and have livestock and so on was exactly as they said all 12 said yes that's true but you see and all 12 said but there's Giants there there's walled cities there's Great Men you know you know there's all these things but 10 of them of the 12 were not convinced in here they were convinced in here I mean so when they saw the opposition they said but we can't take it why cuz they're convinced in here why because they were still the reason I could say they're convincing here because they are trusting their human ability to take the land I mean because they said we are grasshoppers in their sights in other words we are so small they're just going to chew us up but then Caleb and Joshua said no we are more than able to take the land I mean what they were convinced in here that what God has started he's going to finish doesn't matter the battles the the the problems the struggles the hardship the disappointment the regret doesn't matter what we're going to go through Israel we're going to get there I mean exactly as God has said where we're going to live we're going to live amen the prophecy of of of every every of those 12 Patriarchs when their name was spoken and you you know the blessings were given I think the end of Genesis that was actually prophecy of where the tribes would be in the land yes amen what god prophesied with that dwell they're going to dwell I say friends it's the same thing with you and I amen we should be so convinced this word is going to take us it's brought us out of the world it's brought us out of many things amen it's placed us into Christ amen that every Redemptive blessing of God belongs to you and I every promise amen we are not here in a stalemate the devil wants you to think you're stuck this way Saul and Israel were stuck for 40 days with Goliath and and the Philistines right but then one man one boy stepped in who was convinced we don't have to be in the stalemate we don't have to be stuck this way you don't have to put up with the Mind B you have to put up with a problem depression all that you don't have to live with those things anymore you say but all of my family had the spirit in Me God is here to break it amen you see you got to realize how your parents are you don't have to be that way Naturally Speaking he if this filled with the Holy Ghost praise God but if they're struggling with things you got to realize there comes the devil has expiry date but are you convinced that it is here for him in your life it is overdue amen like I was coaching or helping with Anisa's netb and there was an app with the um app with the um score and stuff you know they going all fancy instead of pen and paper and so you start the start the half and of course you the ref's doing all kinds of things but then it goes into overtime on the app you actually have to physically go end and go end game otherwise you just keep running how many of us actually just let the game keep running with the devil we allow him to bombard us and to trouble us and we keep doing what he wants us to do instead of saying Satan I'm sick of you I'm going to feed I'm going to feed on something else it's like Christine was talking to the girls after I was talking about salt you know if you're fully hydrated with fresh water you drink salt water it's not going to bother someone like someone who's dehydrated why cuz you're full of fresh water right so naturally if you're being de hydrated by the world with salt water of this world start taking a fresh drink of water cuz you got to realize if the first drink of this world made you dehydrated instead of making you act a little bit crazy the second drink is not going to help you amen you got to change where you're drinking from amen so I would drink from The Well of Living Water I would start drinking from this word amen IID start listening to it I start praying start changing the music you know maybe there's a total tangent but we need holy uh I'm not saying we don't have this but when it comes to listening to contemporary Christian music you you need Holy Ghost leadership because how many of those gifted people are sitting in darkness trying to talk about a relationship they don't have that the bride has but they don't have you've got to be careful that it's Holy Ghost inspired if you're listening to that stuff amen right because many times they're sitting on this side of the chasm trying to sing about something they don't know and that and it's just a longing right and then and then that longing will come upon you and they'll try and give you that same experience when you're on the other side of the chasm Walking with God so we got to be careful with those things we say Lord lead us in what we listen to amen but but but if the music you listen to just makes you feel more empty makes you feel less stable makes you feel you know more depressed or but but there's a sincerity with it but you I'm just this little thing and no we are more than conquerors I mean we're more than Overcomers he overcame for us amen we are not defeated we're not downtrodden we're not beaten we're not useless no we are the apple of God's eye we are his redeemed we are his loved ones we are the purpose of his being praise God Amen so you got to think what are you listening to does it build Faith now oh but it makes me emotional of course it makes you emotional music should be emotional even even sitting there I remember in um you know you know dead formal Anglican Church at boarding school that made people emotional being bored and being annoyed as emotion it makes even un emotional so you got to be careful with what you but it makes me feel the certain way but what is the feeling what comes after the feeling what does it produce does it give you real Faith does it give you real confidence amen does it give you a real like yes Lord you are you are Supreme you're awesome and I'm your child there we go let's just jump off that sigue come back on so but you know so the so the T spies were not convinced and they even got to a point they said let us make a captain and let us return unto Egypt see they would rather live as slaves you got to think about this they'd rather live as slaves being oppressed than live free in their own land so they wanted this because they considered it safe to be a slave because that's where they are born this is what I'm used to this is the family Dynamic this is my mindset I'm used to being a pessimist the glass is always half empty not if I'm drinking it's half full Hallelujah no everything's half full we should be positive right won the Lord we're on our way to heaven shouting Victory I don't feel very Victorious but he's Victorious hallelujah amen but you see so they consider people consider it safe you know no safety is not in Egypt safety there's no safety in depression there's no safety in anxiety there's no safety in stress there's no safety in double mindness that is not people think it's safe because they're used to it we're going to break out of our safety zone where all things are possible amen we're going to you know so see they were used to see people get used to besetting sin family problems they think that it has to go on that way forever but no it doesn't amen see they would say well it was safer for us in Egypt being used being abused our sons being fed to the crocodiles all these things see they forgot their anguish of death of their babies and their cry to be delivered and they said we'd rather live this way than be free free friends that's not our portion if you think well this is just how I am I Was Born This Way quoting Lady Gaga that means she's crazy I was born this way that's why we need to be born again amen that's why we need to become a new creature that's why we've got to realize if you have had a real experience with God you're not your old man anymore stop letting the old man rule you amen no no he's dead and crucified I mean you're not you whatever your surname is that's not you who you are sure my last name is gloin but I'm a Son of God I thank God for my family all those things but that that is not my identity amen that is not who I am I am this right this is me amen not my not my identity and we're going to realize that the old man he's gone do not resuscitate leave him alone don't feed the animal leave him alone right so don't Panda to this flesh it won't help you none did it help you before you became a Christian no it caused us to get into a lot of trouble but Jesus brought us out I mean so why not focus on the one that brought you out as opposed to the one that caused you a lot of trouble amen so don't Pander to the flesh no feed the spirits what do you mean by pandering to the flesh this flesh loves salt water this flesh now thrives is not the right word but but it's addicted to salt water right but the spirit is addicted to fresh water so the one you feed is the one that's going to dominate your life amen so I'm just going to drink on good old fresh Holy Ghost water amen hallelujah well what if it overflows what if you can't contain your stomach will stretch Hallelujah hey and if it bubbles out it's a good thing it'll bubble out onto someone else amen they'll start having a fresh drink too hallelujah hallelujah hope we're all okay this morning amen so don't don't be caught don't say well it was safer back somewhere else no keep walking with God amen amen but they weren't see they weren't convinced in here like Caleb and Joshua were see but the two that went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that it was a goodly land now I just want to go back to that quickly so I just skipped my mind the evidence of the land did not convince them the anointing of God did not convince them everyone can enjoy see they all enjoyed the grapes they all enjoyed what they you know the things they ate right just like everyone enjoys the holy ghost moving I trust you do amen but that just the anointing did not convince them no Caleb and Joshua were convinced by the revelation of the word right that's what convinced them God has brought us out God is going to take us in amen so we can all be under the anointing but don't let just the anointing convince you let it be the word amen that you're part of the promise I trust this came out right see they were convinced see that's why how can 12 go in and 10 come out with an evil report when all 12 saw the same thing all eight the same grapes also saw the same things see Caleb and Joshua did not deny the Giants or the cities or they didn't deny any of the things they said what those men said was true up to a point and the point that they differed on was 10 said they can't take it two said they could why the two were convinced in here that God was going to do it for them the other 10 were just convinced in here and when you're convinced in here what you see will change if you're convinced or not that's why we walk by faith and not by sight see praise the Lord now but the two that went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that it was a goodly land and we were more than able to make it because it was God's promise and instead of the people going on receiving the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues receiving the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh signs wonders Miracles they felt that it would break down their tradition of Doctrine so in other words it would break down their comfort zone yes and what happened to it they perished in the land that's right but the Believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit they were fully convinced amen that that was going that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land they took the land they settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at being justified at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we pressed on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter said on the day of Pentecost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call are you convinced about it amen let's let's not just stop let's go all the way in amen every promise belongs to you and I whatever Giant's on there he's coming off I mean whatever whatever stronghold of the enemy that thing's being bulldozed we're going to live on that possession amen when the devil says healing is not for you you bulldo him away you say no my God has promised me I am convinced that he's my healer I'm convinced he's my savior I'm convinced he's my family savior amen we've to be convinced he's our Refugee and strength in a very present help in time of trouble who do you turn to in a time of trouble just like brother Isaac you know inspired song service who do I lean on who do I talk to I go to the Rock Amen what what is your source of strength is it is it the word do you find comfort in here when you're troubled amen you can get comfort you can go to the Psalms or anywhere and you can get comfort you can get strength amen you got to you you got to be convinced that he can when you're troubled he can you amen when you're confused he can guide you amen when you're sick he can heal you amen when you need saving he saved you amen when you when you needed to be provided for he's Jehovah Gyra are you convinced that he's all these things amen amen he is our refuge and strength a very help in time of trouble he David would say thou art my Hiding Place he was convinced that God was his hiding place I mean more than the caves of Abdul or somewhere else no God was his hiding place amen I and and thou shalt preserve me from trouble he was convinced God was going to preserve him why is that because God told him he's going to be king amen he was going to end up on the throne and David was convinced that God would get him there are we convinced the Lord's going to change our bodies I mean are we convinced that this Holy Ghost we've received is the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen see he says we will rejoice in thy salvation I'm just winding up here and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all thy petitions now I know now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed hello anointed of the Lord amen I know that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand that's just power punch right there some trust in chariots and summon horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God so David is saying well some are convinced chariots will help them some are convinced horses will help them but I'm convinced amen the name of that our God is a strong tower amen I convinced that he will save his anointed amen I'm convinced that he will hear me when I pray are you convinced he hears your prayers are you convinced the blood puts puts you on speaking terms with him are you convinced about these things amen we don't just go through motions we don't you know the seraphim there that that Isaiah saw around the throne crying out holy holy holy they do it because they're built to do it yes there's no heart in it but you and I can cry out the same thing holy holy holy and because of he's redeemed me he saved me your heart is completely in in your worship and that's what God is looking for are you convinced he has redeemed you amen hallelujah amen God never changes his program we can rest solemnly on what God says the first time Hallelujah he never has to stay with that he I mean he ever sorry has to stay with that he cannot he cannot and never did at any time change it because if he does then he is infinite like we are he makes mistakes he has to apologize and go back but he is the source of all wisdom source of all power he's infinite ipresent om omnicient omnipotent see he's just he's God if he isn't all those things then he isn't God but he has to be that to be God are you convinced amen I'm convinced he's the source of all wisdom I'm convinced he's the source of all power I'm convinced everything I need of is in him amen and I don't need any any other source amen hallelujah amen you know people get ready uh better convinced in 10 days this is speak about the upper room then we can get them in 10 years when our seminaries come out they're still not convinced because they hold their tradition injected into them but when they waited on God for 10 days they were certainly convinced then they certainly was convinced some of them at Pentecost could not even write their own name but they were convinced that it was God Amen they knew it was they would die for the thing they knew it was God they were convinced yeah they knew it was God that's why Peter could stand up he didn't say I think this is that which prophet you know you the prophet Joel said he said this is that the Prophet Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh he was convinced that was God he was convinced that now God lived in them amen they were thoroughly convinced that when Jesus said I'll send the promise of the comforter I will not leave you comfortless I'll come to you he was convinced that that happened there on the day of Pentecost amen they were thoroughly convinced amen they became thoroughly convinced that he was all they needed are you thoroughly and and this is really the nutshell this is what I read last night and it really gripped me are you thoroughly convinced that he's all you need amen Caleb and Joshua are thoroughly convinced all we need is his leadership he will lead us to the promised land he'll lead us to our inheritance he'll take us out of Egypt they were thoroughly convinced am me when Joshua came to the walls of Jericho when the a when the captain of the Angel you know the captain of the Lord's host came to him said you know when Joshua said are you for us or against us and and and the captain of the host of the Lord said no but I come to take over I come as the captain of the host of the Lord Joshua became thoroughly convinced that the one that was leading Moses was now leading him am mean and had now come to take over the entire campaign not just taking Jericho the entire campaign are you thoroughly convinced that your entire campaign Walking with God he's got it he's got the battle plans he knows how to fight the battle he knows what to do are you thoroughly convinced I mean because Joshua became thoroughly convinced that he was all he needed amen amen and I trust that we can look in the word of God and say this is all we need amen this message God has sent are you convinced that it's God's word are you convinced it's the revelation of Jesus Christ are you convinced it's God revealing himself in these end times amen then they were convinced that it was sufficient to take care of them are you convinced God is sufficient to take care of you Amen brother BR he preached the most was Jehovah Gyra the Lord himself will provide Hallelujah are you convinced he will provide for your needs are you convinced that he will keep you together are you convinced he'll keep your are you convinced he'll save your family are you convinced it doesn't matter where they go you see the prodical sons parents became convinced he's out of he's out of his inheritance he's gone to a Strange Land but I'm convinced that our God is more than if God you know imagine if they're having conversation maybe his wife's all upset he would have been brokenhearted too there goes his son there goes a second born son off into the world there he would have been brokenhearted but maybe he just open the scripture and he read there in Exodus I've heard the cries of my people I've come down to deliver them and Mary said you know what honey what's that you know if God can bring out our Forbe out of Egypt if he can bring them out can not get our son back can he not go canot that same Angel of the Lord honey I'm convinced amen we are God's covenant people I am convinced that our God is still alive I'm convinced he's still a deliverer I'm convinced he's the same and if God can go into Egypt and get our forbears out can he not go to where our son is gone and get him back what they became convinced Hallelujah they became convinced and what they begin to do take the promise of God and quote it back to him I mean they became convinced when it says in Isaiah that I'll put my word in the mouth of thy seed and thy seed seed henceforth forever they were convinced that promise was theirs and they began to quote it back to God hallelujah what they became convinced I remember when I first heard brother Brown preaching I was a Homebrew making lost student in the world I heard him preach about the Seal of God I opened my Bible that I had went to Acts chapter 2 3839 I said Lord this is your promis amen you said if I do this you're going to give me the Holy Ghost I've been baptized but I don't know what repentance is you got to lead me to bapt I you got to lead me to repentance This Promise is mine I became convinced that it was my promise amen not in here but in here amen hey it took a couple of years I you had to overcome peer pressure and surrender and all these things but I was convinced and me being convinced took me through a lot of disappointments till I met that until I met him and he changed my life I mean just like Peter when he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he was convinced in his heart I mean he would stand there and nearly 5,000 people would leave after Jesus preached one meeting and then he turned Jesus turned to his disciples will you go also but then Peter would say where shall we go thou have the words of eternal life he was convinced am mean this was more than a Healing Ministry more than a prophetic Ministry it was the word of God being manifested he was convinced and that held him through his denying the Lord through trying to stop see you know in Gethsemane he was trying to stop the word being fulfilled when he when he cut the servant's ear off you know the high priest servant he was trying to stop the word being fulfilled through those disappoints denying the Lord three times all those things him being convinced took him through those things carried him through why because it was a God given he was convinced by God and not by man hallelujah amen are you convinced that he is way of Escape in every Temptation are you convinced you go you go into a Temptation there's trouble yeah you're torn you're pulled but are you convinced there he is a way of Escape amen he never leaves us alone we are never forsaken I me we're never left helpless we're never left out in the wilderness somewhere in the Shepherds he's always there with you amen are you convinced that he's a way of Escape if you're convinced then you'll look for that way of Escape Lord help me help me find this way of Escape in this temptation Lord hallelujah hallelujah he's okay I'm just going to finish with this see brother Bram was
