[46:53] promise for he looked for a city which
[46:56] hath foundations whose building maker as

[48:43] just have your way speak to our hearts
[48:45] like only you can Lord and we'll always
[48:47] want to remember those who couldn't be
[48:48] here today be their portion as well
[48:50] their God may they know that Lord they
[48:52] are not alone Lord but you are there
[48:53] with with him father because you said
[48:55] you'd never leave us nor forsake us dear
[48:57] God may this be a Monumental day Lord in
[48:59] our Christian walk father in Jesus
[49:01] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[49:04] friends you may have your seats uh this
[49:07] morning and just a bit of a context I
[49:09] pray that the Lord will tie these
[49:10] together but you know just just from
[49:12] Matthew 1 and 1 the book of the
[49:13] generation of Jesus Christ the son of
[49:15] David the son of Abraham now I find it
[49:18] amazing that God would tie tie him
[49:20] coming to the Earth through these two
[49:23] men and through every believer but you
[49:25] know there's there's something about us
[49:26] in this day and age now and I know every
[49:29] believer no doubt has felt this way but
[49:31] you know there comes a time when you
[49:33] identify more with with Heaven than you
[49:35] are upon this Earth that that that the
[49:37] more as time goes on you know you know
[49:40] the world is falling it's falling apart
[49:42] as prophesied at work you know but the
[49:44] Believers we know we're not falling
[49:45] apart but we're ascending you know the
[49:47] world is falling like you know like
[49:49] brother Bram saw the vision of his uh
[49:51] son Billy Paul when he went out into the
[49:52] world he saw him jump out of of a window
[49:54] and he's falling tumbling and laughing
[49:56] and falling and he cries out you know
[49:59] brother Brown cries out and he says oh
[50:01] God catch my son then the you know then
[50:03] he saw later on he saw the hands of God
[50:05] catch him and pick him back up where he
[50:08] were and truly this world is falling and
[50:10] laughing as it's falling and going into
[50:12] chaos but I'm so thankful that the that
[50:14] the mighty hands of Jehovah God have
[50:16] caught us amen and picked us up and is
[50:18] carrying us up and restoring us to where
[50:20] we should be but there Comes A Time in
[50:22] our walk where I realize we're we can't
[50:24] stay here much longer you know this
[50:26] world is not our home it's more than a
[50:28] catch phrase it's more than a buzz
[50:30] phrase or whatever more than a song but
[50:32] it becomes a reality to us and I trust
[50:35] this morning or you know maybe you know
[50:37] you've come to that place this world is
[50:39] not my home I'm just passing through
[50:41] this place you know I'm not ordained to
[50:43] stay here I never really I was never
[50:45] made to fit in this place you know I
[50:47] remember growing up I never really fet
[50:48] you're fit in different you know the
[50:50] other cool kids they're the jocks there
[50:52] with the whatever I didn't really fit in
[50:53] any kind of group you know but I come to
[50:56] find out I fit in a group amen amen of
[50:58] the redeemed of Jesus Christ amen and
[51:00] it's because this is where we truly
[51:02] belong amen among among God's children
[51:04] amen and that's because we belong in
[51:07] heaven amen but you see now it's amazing
[51:09] when you look at the uh Promises of God
[51:11] and you know how how Abraham I just
[51:13] looked yesterday I was driving to
[51:15] prepare and you know just thinking about
[51:17] these things in the weekend you know
[51:18] about about how Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[51:21] they all Fellowship Together live
[51:22] together and we're and and we're Heirs
[51:24] of the same promise you know many times
[51:26] we read the Bible and this one's born
[51:28] lives this long dies and the the next
[51:31] one comes on the scene and and we often
[51:33] forget their lives all over overlapped
[51:36] each other and so Abraham Isaac and
[51:38] Jacob they were the ears of the same
[51:40] promise you know it's amazing when you
[51:42] can sit and you can talk with someone
[51:44] who is ear of the same promise you know
[51:46] someone has met the same God you've met
[51:48] amen the same you know they've been
[51:49] transformed by the same God and then
[51:51] you'll become to realize actually the
[51:53] same God gave me the promises given you
[51:55] the promise and now we can Fellowship
[51:57] together and sojourn in this world Amen
[51:59] but we are ears of the same promise now
[52:01] that promise was more than a promised
[52:04] son coming but it was actually because
[52:06] they met The God Who made the heavens
[52:08] and earth they begin looking for a city
[52:10] that wasn't upon this Earth they were
[52:13] looking for a Heavenly City and it
[52:15] wasn't just Abraham looking for the city
[52:16] but Isaac was looking for that City
[52:18] Jacob was looking for that City they all
[52:21] were looking who's looking for that city
[52:22] today amen that was their desire and I
[52:25] you know I believe this is our desire
[52:27] too yeah you know we're we're hungering
[52:31] Amen to to to go to that place now but
[52:35] the reason we're hungering to go is not
[52:36] because the world has fallen apart many
[52:38] people just want to go to heaven because
[52:40] this world is in chaos but that's not
[52:41] the Believers actually desire you know
[52:44] sure we look around we say we just don't
[52:45] fit here anymore but you know but but
[52:48] it's more we don't just want to go
[52:50] because we we want to leave this pest
[52:52] house behind but we want to go because
[52:54] we want to be with him just like the
[52:56] Apostle Paul will put it so well in
[52:58] second Corinthians 5 he says for we know
[53:00] that our Earthly House of this
[53:02] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[53:03] building of God a house not made with
[53:06] hands Eternal in the heavens for in this
[53:08] we grown earnestly Desiring to be
[53:10] clothed upon with our house which is
[53:12] from Heaven if so be that being clothed
[53:15] we shall not be found naked for we are
[53:17] in this Tabernacle do groan being
[53:19] burdened not that we should be unclothed
[53:21] so not that we should leave this world
[53:24] but that we should be closed upon see
[53:26] that's the desire of our hearts Lord I
[53:28] want to step into that new body I want
[53:30] to be where you are so this is the
[53:31] groaning there's the expectation that
[53:33] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[53:35] I mean I trust that's the hunger of your
[53:38] heart today we can't be here much longer
[53:41] we're here at the end of the end of the
[53:43] end
[53:43] praise God while we're here let's be a
[53:45] living witness let's bear Shining Light
[53:47] but you know we can't be here much
[53:49] longer you know
[53:51] we're in a Rapture season we're in a
[53:54] resurrection cycle amen we're we're
[53:57] under expectations through the dead in
[53:58] Christ race and it's not going to be you
[54:00] know it's not maybe my grandchildren's
[54:03] generation it's this generation I'm
[54:05] under expectation to hear you know
[54:07] William or the girls had changed from a
[54:09] little voice going Daddy to Daddy you
[54:12] know William you're picking me up and
[54:13] carrying me around we're in it Lord
[54:15] we're in it Dad we're going to be
[54:17] changed because why we see them change
[54:18] in front of us I trust that's your
[54:21] expectation
[54:22] praise God if you're if you're less than
[54:24] 18 to 21 you're going to be changed to
[54:26] that age if you're older than that
[54:27] you're going to be made young again
[54:28] praise God it's going to be an awesome
[54:30] time but we're living in that season
[54:31] amen so so we can we can have a you know
[54:36] expectation today
[54:38] and brother you know there's something
[54:39] about something about when you meet him
[54:41] you just want to be with him
[54:43] you love being in his presence but you
[54:45] want to see him face to face
[54:47] and you know brother bam says here he
[54:49] says and I want to talk to him and
[54:51] um and you and I know you do too that's
[54:54] why we're here this afternoon I'll say
[54:55] even this morning you love him you long
[54:57] to see him there's something in your
[54:59] heart that longs for that place where
[55:01] you know you've come from it's behind
[55:04] the curtain just the human just the
[55:06] human heart is hungering to get him
[55:08] behind that curtain again to look up
[55:10] past the curtain that's why we come
[55:12] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[55:13] Jesus to see what God will tell us
[55:16] there's something longing to look beyond
[55:17] the curtain of time because these five
[55:19] senses these bodies were trapped and
[55:21] limit us so much Faith declares the
[55:23] Unseen right but one day Faith will
[55:26] become sight I mean we don't just
[55:28] believe and know that we come from God
[55:30] go back to God we'll be with him amen
[55:32] for eternity that your heaven will come
[55:34] down upon the Earth there'll be a new
[55:36] heavens and new earth amen that you're
[55:38] the one that we've loved and we've and
[55:40] we've served and we've longed to see
[55:41] we'll see him face to face more than
[55:43] just his presence Sweeping in the room
[55:45] but we'll see him we'll be caught up to
[55:47] freedom in the air amen who's with me
[55:50] today amen let's just let's just really
[55:52] say we know where we're going we know
[55:55] where we're going in spite of all
[55:57] trouble frustrations ups and downs we
[55:59] know where we're going and I trust
[56:01] there's something in you that desires
[56:03] that Heavenly land amen that you're not
[56:05] bogged down by the lukewarm Spirit of
[56:07] lady osia caught up in the cares of life
[56:10] sure we have cares of life but may it
[56:12] not be the thing that holds us down
[56:14] we're going to take care of life we need
[56:16] to have jobs family all these kind of
[56:18] things we're responsible for a lot of
[56:20] things in life but don't let that be
[56:22] your all in all let the all and all be I
[56:24] want to see him see Enoch you know we've
[56:27] got to come to a place if Mama don't go
[56:29] I'm gonna go if Dad is not going to walk
[56:31] with God I'm going to walk with God if
[56:33] my brother don't walk with him my sister
[56:35] don't walk with him my spouse I'm
[56:37] walking with him that's amazing Enoch
[56:39] walked with God and was not because God
[56:40] took him doesn't say anything about his
[56:42] children doesn't say anything about his
[56:43] wife but he walked with God and that's
[56:46] got to be the same thing we can't let
[56:47] our families hold us back amen we can't
[56:50] even let ourselves hold us back let's
[56:51] just walk with God Amen because remember
[56:53] the only way you can really help one
[56:55] another or your family is to walk with
[56:57] God Hallelujah that's what you've got to
[56:59] do amen so let's just walk with God
[57:02] today Hallelujah not just today but for
[57:05] the rest of our lives now when you think
[57:07] about Abraham he didn't he didn't he
[57:10] didn't start off in this kind of
[57:11] condition
[57:13] he didn't he didn't he wasn't born and
[57:15] then he's a little kid saying I want to
[57:16] see Jesus Oh I want to see great Jehovah
[57:18] God who made all things you know he
[57:20] didn't he didn't start this way longing
[57:22] for that country
[57:24] but as he walked with but the reason he
[57:26] started to long for that country is
[57:27] because he met the king of that country
[57:29] he met the king of the city he met God
[57:31] himself right but he wasn't born this
[57:34] way so Abraham started as a very natural
[57:37] kind of a man worried about what's going
[57:40] on in the world looking after his family
[57:42] and we know when we meet God we still do
[57:43] those things right we don't become uh so
[57:47] Heavenly minded we become no earthly
[57:48] good right we're not some Monk in some
[57:51] Nirvana State sitting on under a tree
[57:53] somewhere right we actually become
[57:55] useful upon this Earth
[57:57] amen some of you don't agree some of you
[57:59] agree so hey praise a lot you know
[58:02] anywho
[58:04] but he didn't start off this way
[58:07] Isaac didn't start off that way he had
[58:09] to met the same God that his father met
[58:10] Jacob didn't start start off that way
[58:13] either he had to meet the same God as
[58:14] father and grandfather met amen no doubt
[58:16] they'd sit around the campfire and you
[58:18] know it can be a bit frustrating
[58:20] sometimes when people talk about God and
[58:22] you don't know him
[58:23] you know people walk off they they
[58:25] switch off they think about something
[58:27] else but when you meet the same one you
[58:29] can have Fellowship you can lock into
[58:31] that conversation you're part of that
[58:32] conversation so no doubt there are days
[58:34] when Isaac just wandered off
[58:36] his dad's talking about God didn't know
[58:38] him but he met him one day then now they
[58:40] could have real Fellowship as a as a
[58:42] father and a son and then then when
[58:44] Jacob's born he maybe thought his
[58:46] granddad was a bit loopy
[58:48] but then he met the same God that his
[58:50] grandfather talked about it changed the
[58:51] whole conversation whole change the
[58:53] whole family Dynamic see so it's more
[58:55] than just having a parents having being
[58:58] Believers or even a spouse or a or a
[59:00] sibling he's going to be your God
[59:02] amen amen so he didn't start off this
[59:04] way no it's amazing when you look at the
[59:06] people that God see see God comes to see
[59:09] God is not ashamed to be called their
[59:11] God
[59:12] we have a lot of spots in life we're not
[59:14] proud of
[59:15] there's a lot of things written in the
[59:17] Bible that you know if if just say if
[59:19] Abraham was sitting there with Moses and
[59:22] Moses would write the commentary of his
[59:23] life Abraham would probably say do you
[59:25] have to write it that way right do you
[59:28] really have to write it that way do you
[59:29] really have to put that in do you really
[59:30] have to put that in there you know you
[59:33] know I backslid out of the promised land
[59:34] because of because of drought and things
[59:36] go down to different countries oh yeah
[59:39] I'm scared to you know for my own skin
[59:41] because I got a beautiful wife and I'm
[59:42] trying to preserve myself don't care
[59:44] about her you know because remember
[59:46] really if you think about if God did not
[59:48] intervene not once but twice Sarah would
[59:51] have been married to another man
[59:52] but it's Abraham trying to save his own
[59:55] skin this is the father of the faith
[59:57] we're talking about you see many times
[59:59] we wrestle with our own failures these
[1:00:01] ones had failures no I'm not excusing
[1:00:03] sin no ways okay but you know we wrestle
[1:00:06] with our past and our failures remember
[1:00:08] Abraham was walking with God when he did
[1:00:10] these things
[1:00:11] some people think as soon as you meet
[1:00:13] God you have no trouble no you do you
[1:00:15] have trouble sometimes you have more
[1:00:17] trouble than before and that's okay
[1:00:18] God's doing a work in your life he's
[1:00:21] going to refine you and mold you and
[1:00:22] take things out of your life that don't
[1:00:24] belong there so you know no doubt
[1:00:26] Abraham would say to Moses do you really
[1:00:28] need to write this
[1:00:31] there you go imagine that you're about
[1:00:33] to fly into a different country because
[1:00:34] maybe you've got to leave your Homeland
[1:00:36] you're going through customs
[1:00:38] you and your wife are filling out
[1:00:39] customs forms
[1:00:41] and she looks over and you have ticked
[1:00:43] unmarried you'd start having words
[1:00:47] what do you mean
[1:00:49] Sarah you've got to put on married too
[1:00:51] big you're beautiful they're going to
[1:00:53] kill me think about me
[1:00:55] advice he's thinking what about me
[1:00:57] I don't get married to some King in this
[1:00:59] place I'm married to you but you know
[1:01:01] that's kind of what happened
[1:01:02] they're walking into Greer they're going
[1:01:04] into Egypt wherever they went you know
[1:01:06] Abraham's saying to Sarah Sarah you're a
[1:01:08] beautiful woman they're going to kill me
[1:01:09] to get you let's just say we're brother
[1:01:10] and sister and they were half brother
[1:01:12] and sister so it was kind of true but it
[1:01:14] was you know a white lie or a small lie
[1:01:16] still a big lie there's no lie scale
[1:01:18] they're all lies okay Shady deal still a
[1:01:21] shady deal okay we don't do those things
[1:01:23] around here I mean we don't tell lies oh
[1:01:25] I'm just bending the truth a bit that's
[1:01:27] a lie let's not do bending okay we're
[1:01:30] not meant to be flexible with the truth
[1:01:31] it's a rigid thing you may be flexible
[1:01:34] naturally but don't be flexible with the
[1:01:36] truth amen so you know they you know
[1:01:38] this happens not once but twice and God
[1:01:40] intervenes yeah yeah and you know and
[1:01:42] then and then Abraham comes to a spot
[1:01:45] where where he he realizes the promise
[1:01:48] is so impossible
[1:01:50] that he laughs in the very presence of
[1:01:52] God
[1:01:54] you know it wasn't just it wasn't just
[1:01:55] Sarah that laughed April Imagine This
[1:01:58] God comes down
[1:02:00] in a service let's just bring it into
[1:02:02] today
[1:02:03] and maybe the song leader someone stands
[1:02:05] up and calls you out
[1:02:07] and says this promise is for you and
[1:02:09] you've been thinking about this promise
[1:02:11] and God's already spoken to you before
[1:02:12] and he's here to confirm it and you just
[1:02:14] like get in the floor and roll and laugh
[1:02:17] this is what Abraham was doing
[1:02:19] yeah I don't think he'd really want
[1:02:20] Moses to be writing that down
[1:02:22] because I'm the father of the faith not
[1:02:25] a father of laughter or a doubt or
[1:02:27] unbelief but he rolled in the presidency
[1:02:29] then Abraham fell down upon his face and
[1:02:32] laughed
[1:02:33] and God's just telling God said unto
[1:02:35] Abraham and for Sarah thy wife thou
[1:02:37] shall not call the name Sarah but Sarah
[1:02:39] shall her name be and I'll bless her and
[1:02:42] give thee a son also of her yea I'll
[1:02:44] bless her and she shall be the mother of
[1:02:45] Nations Kings of people shall be of her
[1:02:48] this is the kind of promise and
[1:02:50] Abraham's been actually walking with
[1:02:52] this promise for a while but he comes to
[1:02:54] a point he thinks this is just a joke
[1:02:57] he'd say to Moses you don't please don't
[1:02:59] write it that way you know do you really
[1:03:01] need to put that bit in there you know
[1:03:03] I'm the father of the nation you know
[1:03:05] please don't put this in there but thing
[1:03:08] is God allows these things to be written
[1:03:10] God allows these things to be written
[1:03:12] because he's not ashamed of his people
[1:03:15] he's not ashamed of his people you know
[1:03:16] he he's actually proud of Abraham you
[1:03:19] know because because after Calvary we
[1:03:21] know in the Old Testament there's all
[1:03:22] these things written of their failures
[1:03:23] and faults but when you come through the
[1:03:26] blood of Jesus Christ and now and now
[1:03:28] the Apostle Paul is inspired by the same
[1:03:31] one that inspired Moses as now writing a
[1:03:33] Divine commentary of these people's
[1:03:35] lives but through the blood of Jesus
[1:03:37] Christ there's sin and their mistakes
[1:03:38] are all gone those things are not
[1:03:40] written of Abraham by Paul he said he
[1:03:44] staggered not at the promise of God but
[1:03:46] was strong in the faith you say well
[1:03:48] hold on this looks like a staggering
[1:03:51] going on
[1:03:52] under the blood of bulls and goats sure
[1:03:55] this really did happen but in the mind
[1:03:58] of God because of the blood of Jesus
[1:04:00] Christ he don't see your mistakes he
[1:04:02] don't see your laughter and your doubt
[1:04:04] and your how can this be no if you're
[1:04:05] part of the promise you're part of the
[1:04:07] promise I think we can say praise the
[1:04:09] Lord let's give the Lord a hand right
[1:04:11] now all right praise God hallelujah
[1:04:14] see Hallelujah see we wrestle with these
[1:04:17] things but God don't wrestle with them
[1:04:19] you know we think we think man God must
[1:04:21] be ashamed of us look at what we've done
[1:04:23] and look at who we are and look at where
[1:04:25] we've failed and you know but God is not
[1:04:28] ashamed to be called their God
[1:04:30] see the accuser comes along he's got a
[1:04:33] list
[1:04:34] he's got a list
[1:04:35] he quotes them back to God because
[1:04:38] remember one thing
[1:04:41] will hold a person
[1:04:43] one thing can stop the resurrection this
[1:04:45] is how powerful the blood of Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ has to be
[1:04:48] remember because of the if if Satan has
[1:04:51] an accusation that that sticks The Plan
[1:04:54] of Redemption is actually totally on
[1:04:56] hold because God can't lose one of his
[1:04:58] children
[1:04:59] that's one thing he can't do he cannot
[1:05:01] lie he cannot go back on his word and he
[1:05:04] cannot lose a part of himself that's
[1:05:05] what his children are part of himself so
[1:05:08] if Satan can just get one and it can be
[1:05:10] even the most smallest accusation but if
[1:05:12] there's that one accusation the whole
[1:05:14] plan is actually on hold because God
[1:05:17] can't lose one of his you see so the
[1:05:20] accuser has a list and he reminds he
[1:05:23] reminds God about that list
[1:05:26] Hallelujah yeah no yo we wrestle with
[1:05:30] these things God don't wrestle with them
[1:05:31] amen God has confidence in his blood God
[1:05:34] has confidence in his salvation amen
[1:05:37] that's why he's not ashamed you know
[1:05:38] he's not embarrassed by us he's not
[1:05:40] embarrassed by you
[1:05:42] Hallelujah you may be embarrassed by
[1:05:44] yourself but God ain't embarrassed by
[1:05:46] you praise the Lord let's just have a
[1:05:48] rejoicing Time come on can we do that
[1:05:51] today you know we we live under such a
[1:05:53] burden of failure
[1:05:55] Jesus took our failure he took our shame
[1:05:57] he took our guilt he took our regret he
[1:06:00] took all those things that day up
[1:06:02] Calvary
[1:06:03] and we bear them no more
[1:06:04] [Applause]
[1:06:06] you may remember this I don't know how
[1:06:08] it was like for Abraham and Sarah after
[1:06:10] the second time
[1:06:12] they go out of a foreign country and
[1:06:14] he's told a lie about his wife I don't
[1:06:16] know how it was
[1:06:18] but that would have been a brill
[1:06:20] that wasn't just a casual thing that
[1:06:21] happened
[1:06:22] right
[1:06:24] but God didn't impute it to him
[1:06:27] God forgave them
[1:06:29] God let it go
[1:06:31] I believe Sarah let it go too
[1:06:34] I trust we can look beyond our failures
[1:06:37] look beyond our Humanity look beyond our
[1:06:41] failure you know see even even Isaac
[1:06:43] will get to a place where he did the
[1:06:44] same thing with his wife
[1:06:48] backsled they go leave the land and he
[1:06:50] says say you're my sister the same sin
[1:06:54] continues down
[1:06:55] you think but surely Lord you've taken
[1:06:57] care of this thing but
[1:06:59] our children will fight the same Devils
[1:07:01] we fought yeah that's right they'll come
[1:07:03] to a situation where they're fighting
[1:07:05] the same enemy yeah yeah but our God is
[1:07:07] greater than that enemy
[1:07:08] I trust we're together this morning you
[1:07:11] see but you know there can be such a
[1:07:12] wrestling see Abraham didn't start off
[1:07:14] just walking with God
[1:07:17] Jimenez him and his parents especially
[1:07:19] they came out of Babel the Tower of
[1:07:21] Babel yeah he was an idolater he
[1:07:24] worshiped Idols I don't know how many he
[1:07:26] had but he used to worship them
[1:07:27] but then God called him one day
[1:07:30] and that was that's what made the
[1:07:32] difference I'm just trying to find a
[1:07:34] quote here see that's what made the
[1:07:36] difference God called him that's what he
[1:07:38] was like anyone else but God called him
[1:07:40] that's what made the difference now God
[1:07:42] didn't haphazardly call Abraham
[1:07:44] before the foundation of the world the
[1:07:46] Lamb of God was slam
[1:07:48] in God's mind he had Abraham in his mind
[1:07:50] he was going to be the father of Nations
[1:07:52] amen Abraham didn't know this when he
[1:07:54] was born there's a lot of things about
[1:07:56] ourselves we do not know
[1:07:57] when we're a child even when we're an
[1:07:59] adult there's a lot of us Abraham was 75
[1:08:02] years old when God called him that's a
[1:08:04] big portion of Life he'd already lived
[1:08:06] he thought well this is just me hey I'm
[1:08:08] retiring I'm done wow no no God wasn't
[1:08:10] God hadn't even started yet has really
[1:08:13] his eternal you know what God put him on
[1:08:16] the earth for hadn't even begun until he
[1:08:17] was 75 years old sometimes we think well
[1:08:20] we just stayed in our ways I would never
[1:08:22] never have that idea in our mind amen
[1:08:24] because we think well we're done and God
[1:08:25] says no you haven't even started yet
[1:08:28] but I'm at retirement age no no you're
[1:08:30] ready
[1:08:31] you're ready we can be young and we're
[1:08:33] ready we can be older and be ready it's
[1:08:35] God's timing God wants to use us for a
[1:08:38] certain thing you know like I think of
[1:08:40] an orchestra you know there's a you know
[1:08:42] there's a lead violin there's a lead
[1:08:44] cello lead whatever and they play a lot
[1:08:46] of the um music
[1:08:48] but everyone in that Orchestra is going
[1:08:50] to play with the same passion yeah
[1:08:51] they're going to play with the same
[1:08:52] enthusiasm they're going to come under
[1:08:54] the same anointing of the conductor the
[1:08:56] music they're going to be at every
[1:08:57] practice they're going to be there
[1:08:59] dilatory dressed right they're not going
[1:09:01] to come in sloppy they're going to have
[1:09:03] their shoes shine the same way they're
[1:09:04] going to look all the same right but
[1:09:07] there's some people that just maybe pick
[1:09:08] up the symbols once
[1:09:10] they're going to play it with the same
[1:09:11] passion they can apply it with the same
[1:09:13] enthusiasm and they just go crash once
[1:09:18] and then they sit down they're done
[1:09:20] three hour I I know how long those
[1:09:22] things go for but yeah it can be three
[1:09:23] hours of playing just one thing on a
[1:09:25] triangle
[1:09:27] but that's the part they're ordained to
[1:09:28] play they're no better than the lead
[1:09:31] violinist they know better than the lead
[1:09:32] part because everyone must be there to
[1:09:35] make the music play right so so maybe
[1:09:38] that crash just you know I think in
[1:09:40] Tchaikovsky's one of his overtures or
[1:09:42] whatever he has cannons firing
[1:09:44] that'd be cool to play that one what are
[1:09:47] you on the orchestra I'm a Canon
[1:09:50] we don't have that live anymore but you
[1:09:52] know
[1:09:53] anyway Russians like loud music
[1:09:55] apparently but you see
[1:09:57] you know we could just be a thing of a
[1:10:00] triangle but let's play that part with
[1:10:02] the same enthusiasm the same passion the
[1:10:06] same Joy because God's ordained us even
[1:10:08] for that part as long as I'm in the
[1:10:09] orchestra I'm happy
[1:10:11] Hallelujah so you see Abraham's part
[1:10:14] started late in his life but that was
[1:10:16] his time to play the part you see he
[1:10:18] started off as an idolaterer he started
[1:10:21] off just like anyone else but God called
[1:10:22] him and that's what made the difference
[1:10:24] now as I said that God you know God
[1:10:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:29] thought of Abraham he knew when he had
[1:10:32] come the role he had play what he'd do
[1:10:34] Abraham had no idea about it until God
[1:10:37] called him and then even as his Walking
[1:10:39] with God God will reveal more of himself
[1:10:41] in his plan to Abraham
[1:10:43] and then so even in spite of in spite of
[1:10:46] all his mistakes of all his failures of
[1:10:49] him laughing at God's promise God didn't
[1:10:52] throw him away
[1:10:53] God didn't quit God didn't get well you
[1:10:56] just you just too stiff-necked and laugh
[1:10:58] and all these things you make fun of me
[1:11:00] you're done no God don't work that way
[1:11:02] God don't run his business haphazardly
[1:11:04] God does not individually call a person
[1:11:07] to throw them away later yeah remember
[1:11:09] this this message is a bridegroom call
[1:11:11] to a union it's not a collective thing
[1:11:14] it's not a nationwide thing it's an
[1:11:16] individual thing where God is calling
[1:11:19] Sons and Daughters to be United with him
[1:11:21] right so when God calls you by this word
[1:11:24] it's not a haphazard call
[1:11:27] it's come unto me
[1:11:29] I'm calling you you're part of this word
[1:11:31] you need to see that you're part of this
[1:11:33] word you're not part of this world
[1:11:35] Abraham thought he was part of this
[1:11:37] world but he began to realize I'm
[1:11:38] actually more part of a Heavenly world
[1:11:40] that I am a natural world and it's the
[1:11:43] same thing with you and I trust you've
[1:11:44] come to a place in your life where
[1:11:46] actually I'm more part of that world
[1:11:48] than this world I identify more with
[1:11:50] Heaven than I do this Earth there's just
[1:11:53] something in me that longs to go there
[1:11:55] more than longs to stay here
[1:11:58] hello you can see that yo when the
[1:12:00] spirit of God moves you say that's
[1:12:01] really who I am amen when you hear the
[1:12:04] word that's really who I am you read
[1:12:06] this word you know I had a funny thought
[1:12:08] come to mind and maybe I'll preach about
[1:12:09] it sometime it was like three in the
[1:12:11] morning I was getting William a bottle
[1:12:12] in this thought just came to mind what
[1:12:13] Bible are you reading yeah
[1:12:16] some people read this Bible they get a
[1:12:18] whole different kind of thing but to the
[1:12:19] Bride of Jesus Christ the book is not
[1:12:21] sealed it's come open we know who God is
[1:12:24] we know who we are we know who the devil
[1:12:27] is he's a loser by the way and he's
[1:12:29] going to burn we ain't going to burn
[1:12:30] we're going to shine and rejoice and
[1:12:32] dance around the throne amen so the book
[1:12:35] has not veiled to us it's been opened
[1:12:39] praise the Lord so God God before the
[1:12:42] foundation of the world thought of
[1:12:43] Abraham and what he would do
[1:12:46] he thought of you and what you would do
[1:12:48] he would look Beyond he knew remember
[1:12:50] God by Foreign foreknowledge looked
[1:12:53] through time and saw you answer a desire
[1:12:56] knew that you'd want to be saved that
[1:12:58] you'd want to be part of him so he put a
[1:13:00] seat of election in your soul
[1:13:02] that he put there you didn't put there
[1:13:05] right you didn't make yourself a
[1:13:08] Christian
[1:13:08] the Bible says it's not him that willeth
[1:13:11] will runeth but God that shows Mercy
[1:13:13] says it's not him that says I'm going to
[1:13:15] be the best Christian out no or I'm
[1:13:17] going to do this with all my might no
[1:13:19] it's God that shows Mercy right and we
[1:13:22] know God showed us Mercy why because
[1:13:24] he's changed our hearts changed our
[1:13:25] desires changed our lives and we can
[1:13:27] look back and say this wasn't actually
[1:13:29] my idea
[1:13:31] this is not on my schedule I didn't have
[1:13:33] this on my Google Calendar right this
[1:13:36] this wasn't my Five-Year Plan but it was
[1:13:38] in God's Eternal plan and that's What
[1:13:41] mattered see sometimes we wrestle with
[1:13:42] but I was raised in church but there
[1:13:44] came a time when the light came on
[1:13:45] right there came a time when the light
[1:13:47] came on just like someone like myself
[1:13:48] out from the world but the light came on
[1:13:50] one day I heard the same word that you
[1:13:52] have all heard being raised in church
[1:13:54] but the light went on
[1:13:56] and that's the thing that makes us all
[1:13:58] in common the light went on see it
[1:14:00] doesn't matter where God found us the
[1:14:02] light went on and I trust the light has
[1:14:04] gone on today amen you can say yes God
[1:14:07] has become a personal God Amen he's not
[1:14:09] just a god of my family of the church I
[1:14:11] go to or whatever but he's alive to me
[1:14:13] amen he's real amen he's not a figment
[1:14:16] of my imagination but he's the same
[1:14:18] yesterday today and forever
[1:14:20] Hallelujah
[1:14:22] praise God so now
[1:14:24] amen see he wasn't see Abraham was just
[1:14:26] like any other man maybe coming out of
[1:14:28] Babylon perhaps an idolata but God by
[1:14:30] election God does the choosing we can't
[1:14:32] choose God does the choosing we have
[1:14:34] nothing to do with it well then what
[1:14:36] about Free Will well the Bible says
[1:14:38] whosoever will let them come yeah
[1:14:41] if you're willing there's a place
[1:14:43] if you want him he's here to be wanted
[1:14:45] he's here to be received if you want him
[1:14:47] right but we can't let this world bog us
[1:14:50] down
[1:14:51] that we come to a place where we don't
[1:14:53] want him anymore
[1:14:54] see the devil wants to make us lukewarm
[1:14:56] formal and Powerless he wants to fill
[1:14:58] our mind and fill our desires with
[1:15:01] everything but God the devil will never
[1:15:03] help you in your Christian walk
[1:15:06] he'll never put a thought in your mind
[1:15:07] you should go pray oh I never put the
[1:15:09] thought of your mind isn't the Lord
[1:15:10] amazing isn't he great the devil won't
[1:15:13] do that kind of a thing he'll say you're
[1:15:16] too tired you're too busy what about
[1:15:17] this this has got to happen what about
[1:15:19] this and just fail you to overflowing of
[1:15:21] worry and things
[1:15:22] amen oh is that just me he does too I'm
[1:15:25] glad okay I'm glad I'm glad we have we
[1:15:27] let you praise a lot you know but you
[1:15:30] see the devil never encourage you in
[1:15:32] your Christian walk before you meet God
[1:15:34] the devil's not resisting you none he's
[1:15:36] encouraging you in his way but then when
[1:15:38] the Lord gets a hold of you and you
[1:15:40] begin to swim against the tide you know
[1:15:42] man this is a struggle of course it is
[1:15:44] because you've given your life to God
[1:15:47] and the devil wants it back but the
[1:15:49] thing is your life never belonged to the
[1:15:51] devil and it never will belong to the
[1:15:53] devil sure we're all born under his
[1:15:55] influence of his anointing but the seed
[1:15:57] of God on the inside of us was Gods we
[1:16:00] never belong to Satan to begin with amen
[1:16:02] we belong to the Lord now
[1:16:05] now this has got something to this is
[1:16:07] about
[1:16:08] um jewelry but I'm not talking about
[1:16:09] jewelry here but it's not just
[1:16:11] especially that underlined but he's
[1:16:12] answering a question the sister's asking
[1:16:14] about you know wedding rings and and
[1:16:15] jewelry and necklaces and things but but
[1:16:18] he's saying here but I think it's the
[1:16:20] approach of it yeah it's the way you do
[1:16:23] it see it's the motive behind it and
[1:16:26] when you say it's getting a hold of you
[1:16:27] then leave the thing alone
[1:16:29] so when something grips you so much
[1:16:31] that's not of God
[1:16:33] it begins to get a hold of you
[1:16:35] we all know a time when something's just
[1:16:36] a casual interest and it starts to fill
[1:16:39] your mind more and your affections more
[1:16:42] and your imagination more and it fills
[1:16:44] your whole life
[1:16:45] and it may not even be a sinful thing
[1:16:49] I remember the last thing the Lord dealt
[1:16:50] with me before I met him is that he said
[1:16:53] to me you're worshiping your education I
[1:16:55] was just wanting to do well I was
[1:16:57] studying and I used to biochemistry in
[1:16:59] these things and you know but but it
[1:17:00] consumed all that I was
[1:17:02] but it wasn't a sinful thing it's not
[1:17:04] sinful to get an education get a degree
[1:17:06] that's all fine right but when it when
[1:17:09] it gets a hold of you so much you don't
[1:17:10] have any room for anything else in your
[1:17:12] life then that's the problem
[1:17:14] see and and the thing is when the Lord
[1:17:16] told me that I surrendered it to him did
[1:17:18] I quit studying no I finished my studies
[1:17:21] yeah but it did it wasn't my all in all
[1:17:24] see so when something is getting see
[1:17:26] some you see when you see it getting a
[1:17:28] hold of you then leave the thing alone
[1:17:31] who's with me here amen amen don't let
[1:17:34] don't let the things of this world grip
[1:17:36] you in such a way even things that are
[1:17:37] not wrong especially you know if
[1:17:39] something's wrong get rid of it but even
[1:17:40] things that are actually it's not sinful
[1:17:42] but if it grips you amen that it fills
[1:17:45] your imagination your desires everything
[1:17:46] then leave that thing alone it's not
[1:17:48] worth it
[1:17:49] amen it's better to walk with God
[1:17:52] than than
[1:17:54] you know get caught up in those things
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:17:59] now the reason Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:18:03] all look for that cities because they
[1:18:05] all met the king of that City
[1:18:07] now he came in different forms now if
[1:18:09] you read through the Book of Genesis
[1:18:10] even the read through the account of
[1:18:11] Abraham's walk with God God comes in
[1:18:14] different ways he comes as you know
[1:18:16] Jehovah
[1:18:18] it comes as the god of Lord God Almighty
[1:18:20] al-shadai you know he comes to different
[1:18:23] forms then he comes as Melchizedek
[1:18:26] they there's not three different gods
[1:18:28] it's the same God changing form
[1:18:31] yeah right so we'll read this then we'll
[1:18:33] go to the scripture to to to show how
[1:18:35] this ties and now we find this grace
[1:18:36] through the Abraham on the road back
[1:18:37] coming back after the victory is over he
[1:18:39] met the possessor of heavens and earth
[1:18:41] Melchizedek which is the king of
[1:18:42] Jerusalem king of Salem which was
[1:18:44] Jerusalem which is the king of Peace
[1:18:46] which is the king of righteousness he
[1:18:48] had no father he had no mother he never
[1:18:49] did beginning never will end so that was
[1:18:51] nothing else but the almighty and he met
[1:18:54] him on the road home from the slaughter
[1:18:55] of the king he met the possessor the one
[1:18:57] who owned all things met him on the road
[1:18:59] back what a glorious thing you see he
[1:19:03] met the king of that Eternal City and
[1:19:05] that's why he wanted to find the city
[1:19:07] because he met the king of that City now
[1:19:09] remember Isaac and Jacob were were the
[1:19:12] same heir to that same promise sure he
[1:19:16] didn't come to Isaac or Jacob as
[1:19:18] Melchizedek
[1:19:20] but it was still the same God in a
[1:19:22] different form coming to them so you see
[1:19:24] thing is when anyone really meets God it
[1:19:26] puts them under expectation I want to go
[1:19:29] to that City
[1:19:30] Hallelujah see for this Melchizedek king
[1:19:32] of Salem priest of the most high God who
[1:19:34] met Abraham returned from the slaughter
[1:19:35] of the Kings and blessed him Tom also
[1:19:37] Abraham gave a tenth part of all first
[1:19:39] being by interpretation king of
[1:19:41] righteousness and after that also king
[1:19:42] of Salem which is king of peace without
[1:19:44] father without mother without descent
[1:19:46] having near the beginning of days nor
[1:19:47] end of life but made like unto the Son
[1:19:49] of God abideth a priest continually now
[1:19:52] consider how this great man was unto
[1:19:54] whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the
[1:19:56] tenth part of the spoils right but to
[1:19:59] have to be without father or mother
[1:20:00] without dissent or beginning a days or
[1:20:03] end of life that only one person can be
[1:20:05] that that's eternal
[1:20:06] this is not a natural man right this is
[1:20:09] God hallelujah this is God himself that
[1:20:12] Abraham you say but this but you say but
[1:20:15] consider how great this man was verse
[1:20:17] four yeah because he came in the form of
[1:20:18] a man
[1:20:19] it's not a priesthood right it's not a
[1:20:23] natural King this was God himself
[1:20:25] Abraham met and then he had such a
[1:20:28] longing to go to that great city are you
[1:20:31] all with me today maybe I'm just
[1:20:32] repeating myself but you know I think we
[1:20:34] should set our affections on things
[1:20:36] above right our heart should be remember
[1:20:38] where your heart is that's where your
[1:20:39] Treasures are also right so we should
[1:20:42] say Lord I want my heart to be in heaven
[1:20:44] maybe where my treasures are not upon
[1:20:46] the Earth with these things where moth
[1:20:49] and rust doth corrupt amen but you see
[1:20:51] when you see something get a hold of you
[1:20:53] that's not of God leave the thing alone
[1:20:54] but when you see the Lord get a hold of
[1:20:57] you you grip on too he gets a halt you
[1:21:00] get a hold amen until and until he
[1:21:03] changes you
[1:21:06] you see but we live in a very lukewarm
[1:21:08] age
[1:21:09] and lukewarmness we are not exempt from
[1:21:12] lukewarmness we are not immunized from
[1:21:14] lukewarmness that's right right but we
[1:21:16] have we have antibodies spiritual
[1:21:19] antibodies that combat lukewarmness
[1:21:22] right we you know we don't we're not
[1:21:24] immune every Spirit In This World we're
[1:21:26] not immune from
[1:21:27] we don't get a free pass from
[1:21:28] lukewarmness remember the world may be
[1:21:30] in lady osia we may not be in ladio
[1:21:33] Sierra in that sense but that spirit
[1:21:34] will still try and come into our lives
[1:21:36] and make us lukewarm formal and
[1:21:38] Powerless
[1:21:39] but when we realize where we come from
[1:21:42] all the lukewarmness should go away when
[1:21:45] we realized that actually we met the
[1:21:46] king of that City and the reason we met
[1:21:48] him is because we have a place in that
[1:21:50] City
[1:21:51] Hallelujah
[1:21:52] amen I'm just going to read this so for
[1:21:54] the reading but we're just going to read
[1:21:55] this this is from the church age book
[1:21:56] Revelations two and four nevertheless I
[1:21:58] have somewhat against thee because thou
[1:22:00] has left thy first love to understand
[1:22:02] this you must realize the spirit is not
[1:22:04] speaking to the original Saints of
[1:22:05] Ephesus alone this message to the entire
[1:22:07] age which lasts about 120 years its
[1:22:11] message centers to all generations in
[1:22:12] that span now say it's also to this
[1:22:15] generation right now history keeps
[1:22:17] repeating itself in the generations of
[1:22:19] Israel we see Revival in one generation
[1:22:21] only see the fires fading in the next
[1:22:24] and the third generation Embers may be
[1:22:25] glowing slightly but in the fourth
[1:22:27] generation there's no Vista whatsoever
[1:22:29] of that original flame then God lights
[1:22:31] the fire again in the same process is
[1:22:33] repeated it's simply the manifestation
[1:22:35] of the truth that God has no
[1:22:37] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[1:22:39] by natural birth any more than there's
[1:22:41] any truth to Apostolic succession it
[1:22:43] isn't in the word you start out with
[1:22:45] truly born-again Believers and when the
[1:22:47] next Generation comes along they're no
[1:22:48] longer just plain Christians but they've
[1:22:50] taken a denominational name they're now
[1:22:52] Baptist Smiths Etc that's exactly what
[1:22:54] they are too they're not Christians you
[1:22:56] have to be born of the will of God not
[1:22:57] the will of man to be saved but these
[1:22:59] folks are all coming together by the
[1:23:01] will of man now I don't say that some of
[1:23:04] them aren't right with God not for a
[1:23:05] minute do I say that but the original
[1:23:06] fire has died down they are not the same
[1:23:09] anymore
[1:23:11] the fervent desire to please God the
[1:23:13] passion to know his word the cry for the
[1:23:15] reaching out and the spirit all begins
[1:23:17] to fade and instead of that church being
[1:23:19] on fire with the fire of God has cooled
[1:23:21] off and become a bit formal that's just
[1:23:23] what has happened back there to the
[1:23:24] Ephesians they are getting a bit formal
[1:23:26] the abandonment to God was dying out and
[1:23:28] the people weren't too careful about
[1:23:30] what God thought of them as they began
[1:23:32] to be careful about what the world
[1:23:34] thought of them what so the things the
[1:23:36] world started to get a hold of them and
[1:23:38] they are more careful about those things
[1:23:39] well what does that guy think about me
[1:23:41] that guy who part never made again in
[1:23:43] your life what does she think about me
[1:23:45] oh I like that guy like you know to have
[1:23:47] a crush is all perfectly normal but
[1:23:49] don't let a crush rule your life
[1:23:51] you know some random person on the
[1:23:53] street you may never know that person
[1:23:55] again
[1:23:56] are you with me as I told you you know
[1:23:59] there was a guy in my dorm you know uh
[1:24:01] there at boarding school
[1:24:02] he wasn't my friend he didn't like me
[1:24:05] but he's one of the rich kids so I
[1:24:07] started trying to dress like him to try
[1:24:09] and act like him
[1:24:10] he wasn't my friend
[1:24:12] we're not in touch anymore
[1:24:14] it didn't do me any good but I was
[1:24:16] trying to live before people I thought
[1:24:17] it was cool
[1:24:19] I think the Lord Jesus is the coolest
[1:24:21] man out
[1:24:22] we should live before him
[1:24:24] I trust you don't mind me saying it that
[1:24:25] way but you know we shouldn't be caught
[1:24:27] up see we should be more we should
[1:24:29] actually be more careful about What God
[1:24:31] Says About Us then what the world says
[1:24:33] about us
[1:24:34] I mean that second generation coming on
[1:24:36] was just like Israel they demanded a
[1:24:37] king to be like other nations when they
[1:24:39] did that they rejected God but they did
[1:24:41] it anyway it was the history of the
[1:24:42] church when it thinks more of conforming
[1:24:45] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:24:46] God it isn't long until you see them
[1:24:48] stop doing things they used to do and
[1:24:50] start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:24:51] initially they changed their manner of
[1:24:53] dress their attitudes and their behavior
[1:24:55] they get lacks at what Ephesus means
[1:24:57] relax drifting
[1:24:58] amen you see this is and and the cycle
[1:25:01] has never failed we're not immune from
[1:25:03] the cycle right sure I said we're in the
[1:25:05] bride's Revival all these things but it
[1:25:06] can be greater than what it is and we
[1:25:08] can be caught up in a cycle of Revival
[1:25:10] and death
[1:25:11] but God has called us higher we don't
[1:25:14] belong in this world we belong in glory
[1:25:16] right our identity is in heaven amen not
[1:25:19] upon the Earth
[1:25:21] says what you say well
[1:25:24] this is not a very nice picture you're
[1:25:25] painting we don't belong here
[1:25:28] okay our affection should be on the
[1:25:30] things above
[1:25:31] amen we shouldn't be starting to do
[1:25:33] things that we didn't do initially that
[1:25:35] we stopped doing we shouldn't go back
[1:25:36] into those things they see a
[1:25:38] lukewarmness will try and come in and
[1:25:40] drag us back to those things but we're
[1:25:42] above a lukewarms first right it is not
[1:25:44] our portion it's not our inheritance
[1:25:46] amen we are not ordained to be we may be
[1:25:49] in a lukewarm condition from time to
[1:25:51] time but God's very good at getting us
[1:25:52] out of it
[1:25:53] right but we gotta really think back
[1:25:55] when God really moved in power I think
[1:25:57] of Camp often when when when Elizabeth
[1:25:59] received the Holy Ghost and then the
[1:26:01] camp in um Canada you know you just
[1:26:03] there's a time we just God steps into
[1:26:04] the place sure the atmosphere is blessed
[1:26:07] and it feels one of us when that when
[1:26:08] you see that being come in
[1:26:10] come down like that you know God himself
[1:26:14] we all know what you're talking about
[1:26:15] amen you all need I don't know you all
[1:26:17] knew where you were in the building when
[1:26:19] that happened to Elizabeth you may not
[1:26:21] know now it's happening at the time but
[1:26:23] amen that's God stepped in God filled
[1:26:25] with the Holy Ghost I said Lord I want
[1:26:27] to have those moments
[1:26:29] amen way Lord you can step down like
[1:26:31] that you say well we need to go to camp
[1:26:33] for that no you can have that in your
[1:26:35] car you can have that in your kitchen
[1:26:36] you can have that in your bed you can
[1:26:39] have that brushing your teeth yes I mean
[1:26:42] because God is God hate you we can have
[1:26:43] it here today in church amen whether God
[1:26:46] creates where we create an atmosphere
[1:26:48] that God steps down to it whenever he
[1:26:51] wants and does whatever he wants to do
[1:26:53] amen you see he said now if we think it
[1:26:55] because why does God do that because
[1:26:56] he's telling you you belong with me you
[1:26:59] belong with me that's why he anoints
[1:27:01] that's why he fills with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:02] that's why okay let's just do one thing
[1:27:05] right now whatever your fate battling
[1:27:08] leave it at the door
[1:27:10] whatever the trial you're through right
[1:27:12] now forget about it
[1:27:13] just put it to one side
[1:27:15] God will take care of it right you say
[1:27:18] it's such a big mountain it'll become a
[1:27:20] plane in front of you don't worry about
[1:27:22] that thing okay don't let it consume you
[1:27:25] see we can be so burdened down by things
[1:27:28] we cannot fix but that's when God can
[1:27:30] step in we are not made to fix the world
[1:27:33] if man could fix every problem we'd have
[1:27:36] a peace we'd have a millennium right now
[1:27:38] but man cannot fix any problem
[1:27:41] even redeem man we cannot fix God as the
[1:27:44] fiction God is the mender God brings a
[1:27:47] solution but if we get so vexed and
[1:27:49] caught up with things you say well how's
[1:27:51] this going to work out I don't know but
[1:27:53] God is the fixer God is the mender God
[1:27:56] brings the answers let's just put all
[1:27:58] those things to one side because the
[1:28:00] accuser comes along and says you're
[1:28:02] facing this and you've got this trouble
[1:28:04] and this is happening in your family and
[1:28:07] look at what happened yesterday and look
[1:28:09] how you reacted to that you shouldn't
[1:28:10] have reacted that way the accuser comes
[1:28:13] along but God says I'm not ashamed to
[1:28:15] call them my son or my daughter and I'm
[1:28:18] here with them in the challenge in the
[1:28:19] battle Hallelujah God is not ashamed to
[1:28:22] call you a brother or sister amen we'll
[1:28:25] get to that soon you see so don't worry
[1:28:26] about what's happening in life God will
[1:28:28] take care of it hasn't he taken care of
[1:28:31] you thus far
[1:28:33] has they been faithful and true Abraham
[1:28:35] is serving Idols God calls them he
[1:28:38] starts walking amen he has trouble with
[1:28:40] lot and things he keeps walking he goes
[1:28:43] He backslides because of pressure how
[1:28:45] can I oh there's a drought I can't fix
[1:28:47] the drought what am I going to do goes
[1:28:48] down to Korea you know throws his wife
[1:28:51] under the bus to preserve his own skin
[1:28:53] he's not faithful but God's still
[1:28:55] faithful amen one of the Kings is going
[1:28:58] to marry Sarah in the morning brother
[1:28:59] Brown says he puts on his pajamas you
[1:29:01] know deals down to pray like he always
[1:29:03] does and God says you're as good as it
[1:29:05] did man and the King's like what do you
[1:29:07] mean he says well that woman you're
[1:29:09] planning to marry tomorrow is that man's
[1:29:11] wife and he's my prophet
[1:29:14] oh amen get him to pray for you and he's
[1:29:17] like I've done nothing wrong Abraham did
[1:29:20] all the wrong but just because Abraham
[1:29:22] did that didn't mean he wasn't God's
[1:29:23] Prophet no more
[1:29:25] ABC Abraham wasn't faithful but God
[1:29:28] stayed faithful
[1:29:30] Hallelujah Jacob wasn't faithful God
[1:29:32] stayed faithful Isaac wasn't faithful
[1:29:34] God stayed faithful amen all of us we
[1:29:36] can put our name there we weren't
[1:29:38] faithful but God stayed faithful amen
[1:29:40] we've run from him we've tried to quit
[1:29:42] many times we think what's the use of
[1:29:44] serving him no more but then God steps
[1:29:46] on the scene saying you're my seed I'll
[1:29:47] not let you go that way see God's
[1:29:49] children can go a certain way and then
[1:29:51] God stops them in their track you say
[1:29:53] well I've gone in the world I've run
[1:29:54] away of Bex that I've done all these
[1:29:56] kind of things but yet God remains
[1:29:58] faithful
[1:29:59] Hallelujah so God will if God can save
[1:30:01] my soul can he look after my finances
[1:30:04] can he look after my family can he look
[1:30:06] after my job can he take care of my
[1:30:08] house or whatever it is if he can save
[1:30:10] me

[1:30:15] in this end time to get a hold of you
[1:30:17] and I can't he take care of our Natural
[1:30:19] Life
[1:30:21] well I'm facing big problems Believers
[1:30:24] have big problems all the way down

[1:31:47] choose to believe Faith starts with a
[1:31:50] decision
[1:31:51] well I need to feel some great big
[1:31:53] anointing no it starts with a decision
[1:31:55] remember faith and doubt operate the
[1:31:57] gate into the soul

[1:32:05] Hallelujah
[1:32:06] yeah it's amazing how we can get up get
[1:32:09] as I've said before caught up with um
[1:32:11] Earthly problems here is here is Elisha
[1:32:14] and I think gehazi you know they're
[1:32:15] there in the city
[1:32:17] yeah the Assyrians are accountable the
[1:32:19] syrians are kept all around you know
[1:32:20] brother Braham says it's like you know
[1:32:21] they get up in the morning gehazi goes
[1:32:23] to put out the milk bottles he sees all
[1:32:25] these um because people used to do that
[1:32:27] you know milk chocolate go along and who
[1:32:30] remembers those days
[1:32:32] right yep those things used to happen
[1:32:33] they don't happen no more but they used
[1:32:35] to happen so we had to go put out the
[1:32:37] milk bottles and you know he gets the
[1:32:39] matter out of his eyes because he hasn't
[1:32:40] had his third coffee in the morning and
[1:32:42] you know he he looks across the plain
[1:32:44] and it was flat there was nothing there
[1:32:45] the night before but in the morning
[1:32:47] there's tents and this Army says this
[1:32:49] Siege weapons there's all these things
[1:32:51] and he begins to panic
[1:32:52] we're stuck we're done they're going to
[1:32:55] take the city they're going to Massacre
[1:32:57] us it's all over and then Elisha you

[1:33:10] and try and work it may we pay them and
[1:33:11] you know you know because a million
[1:33:13] things go through your mind
[1:33:14] trying to bring an answer and Elisha

[1:33:24] eyes he didn't pray Lord bring your
[1:33:26] armies down he said Lord open his eyes

[1:33:31] already there and that unseen realm they
[1:33:33] were surrounding the city they are
[1:33:35] surrounding the prophet they were his
[1:33:37] security detail
[1:33:38] yeah Glory that they were already there
[1:33:41] but but the prophet's prayer opened
[1:33:43] gehazi's eyes that he would see that
[1:33:46] they were there I pray God would open
[1:33:48] our eyes once in a while Amen to see
[1:33:50] that actually he's here he's with us
[1:33:53] I'll never leave him nor forsake Thee
[1:33:55] the angel of the Lord encamps about
[1:33:56] those who fear Him and delivers them all
[1:33:58] Hallelujah so he encamps around you
[1:34:01] wherever you go
[1:34:03] Hallelujah
[1:34:05] praise God I like that don't you
[1:34:07] I mean so so now gehazi was more shocked
[1:34:10] with I think it's gehazi he is more
[1:34:11] shocked with the armies of Heaven than
[1:34:13] he was the enemy against them
[1:34:16] Hallelujah but you see if we could just
[1:34:18] be gripped by that Eternal Realm
[1:34:21] like he did he was grip imagine seeing
[1:34:23] that that'd be awesome that'd be the
[1:34:25] shock of your life to see all of that
[1:34:27] there you know and it was already didn't
[1:34:29] come down it was already there
[1:34:32] basically he was Heaven got a hold of
[1:34:34] him
[1:34:36] by that now if we could just get let the
[1:34:39] word get a hold of us in the same manner
[1:34:41] I believe nothing will move us nothing
[1:34:44] will really trouble us anymore we
[1:34:45] realize actually actually God's on my
[1:34:47] side
[1:34:48] God's here God's for us if God is for us
[1:34:51] who can be against us
[1:34:53] Hallelujah you see now
[1:34:57] the Apostle Paul would say that his
[1:34:59] desire though not as I have already
[1:35:01] obtained neither were already perfect
[1:35:02] but I follow after if that I may
[1:35:05] apprehend that which is which that for
[1:35:07] which also I'm apprehend of Christ Jesus
[1:35:09] apprehended of Christ Jesus he says
[1:35:12] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:35:14] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:35:16] this is one thing he does forgetting
[1:35:18] those things which are behind reaching
[1:35:20] forth unto those which are before I
[1:35:22] press towards the mark for the prize of
[1:35:24] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:35:26] so he's basically saying I've been
[1:35:29] apprehended God apprehended me on the
[1:35:31] road to Damascus I had my plans I had my
[1:35:34] ideas my ambitions but then God
[1:35:35] interrupted those plans and got a hold
[1:35:37] of my life so now the thing that's got a
[1:35:39] hold of me I'm trying to get a hold of
[1:35:41] it holy so you can say heaven reached
[1:35:43] down and got the Apostle Paul now he's
[1:35:45] trying to reach up and get a hold of
[1:35:46] Heaven and I trust that's the same thing
[1:35:48] with you and I something God something
[1:35:50] gripped me
[1:35:52] it wasn't a church it wasn't you know it
[1:35:54] wasn't even a preacher especially wasn't
[1:35:56] a preacher it wasn't a minister it
[1:35:57] wasn't some movement it was God
[1:36:00] Jesus Christ gripped me and now I'm
[1:36:02] trying to get a hold of him Hallelujah
[1:36:05] amen but you see now God does that
[1:36:07] because he's not ashamed to call us
[1:36:09] brethren
[1:36:10] I love this you know every time I see
[1:36:12] like David's side and sound yo yo yo the
[1:36:14] plays and things of of of of of the
[1:36:17] Believers and you see their sins and and
[1:36:19] their failures and yeah because
[1:36:20] everything has a ripple effect
[1:36:22] remember Al what we do affects others
[1:36:25] older siblings influence younger
[1:36:27] siblings father you know influences
[1:36:30] mother and mother influences father and
[1:36:33] they influence the children then we
[1:36:34] influence those on our job or our school
[1:36:36] whoever we are our children see there's
[1:36:37] influence it's a you know ripple effect
[1:36:39] there you drop a rock in a pond and all
[1:36:42] the waves go out yeah right the bigger
[1:36:44] the stone the bigger the waves
[1:36:46] but you see so David see see uh See the
[1:36:50] opening scripture
[1:36:51] um that I read in Matthew 1 God would
[1:36:53] attribute
[1:36:54] his son coming to the Earth through
[1:36:57] David
[1:36:58] here was David now just like Abraham
[1:37:00] Abraham had a lot of spots that he
[1:37:02] didn't play didn't want Moses to write
[1:37:04] down
[1:37:05] but God would have them written down
[1:37:07] and then we know Moses didn't write the
[1:37:09] life of David because Moses was of
[1:37:11] course well and gone truly by the time
[1:37:13] David turned up but you see David had a
[1:37:15] lot of failings
[1:37:16] he his sins were far worse than Saul's
[1:37:19] sins
[1:37:21] right but yet God would talk about the
[1:37:24] sure mercies of David
[1:37:26] and you know David David wasn't born
[1:37:29] you know he didn't just you know start
[1:37:31] crawling and begin to sing the Lord as
[1:37:33] my shepherd and I've got a hungering you
[1:37:36] know I long to be in the prince of God
[1:37:37] see he wasn't perfect
[1:37:40] to put it that way he didn't have it all
[1:37:43] together he was a fallen failed human
[1:37:45] being
[1:37:46] but he had a longing
[1:37:48] he would begin to play as harp and after
[1:37:51] he's anointed by Samuel he said the
[1:37:53] spirit of God was with him from that day
[1:37:54] on so he didn't have a longing sorry
[1:37:56] I'll take that take that bit off the
[1:37:57] tape okay
[1:37:58] right he had a longing but he was a man
[1:38:01] after God's Own Heart that's what made
[1:38:02] him different he didn't make himself
[1:38:05] that way God made him that way
[1:38:07] we see we all have a certain amount of
[1:38:09] desire desire right for things and like
[1:38:13] brother and he said if you spread it
[1:38:15] thin so much there'll only be a little
[1:38:16] bit for God
[1:38:18] get the main part of it for the Lord
[1:38:20] right don't don't let other things get a
[1:38:22] hold of you let him get a hold of you
[1:38:24] but you see David David would you know
[1:38:27] he would
[1:38:29] he would kill Uriah to take Bathsheba he
[1:38:32] would number the people he did all kinds
[1:38:35] of horrible things
[1:38:36] but yet the Lord said my son is going to
[1:38:40] come through this man the natural
[1:38:41] lineage is going to come through this
[1:38:43] man see that's how much God is not
[1:38:45] ashamed
[1:38:46] to call us brethren
[1:38:49] see let's just read this here thou has
[1:38:51] put all things in subjection under his
[1:38:52] feet for that he put uh put all his
[1:38:55] objection unto him he left nothing that
[1:38:57] is not put under him but now we see not
[1:39:00] yet all things put under him but we see
[1:39:02] Jesus who has made a little lower than
[1:39:04] the angels for the suffering of death
[1:39:05] crowned with Glory and Honor that he by
[1:39:08] the grace of God should taste death for
[1:39:10] every man for it became him for whom are
[1:39:12] all things and by whom are all things
[1:39:14] and bringing many sons unto glory to
[1:39:17] make the capture of their salvation
[1:39:18] perfect through sufferings for both he
[1:39:21] that sanctifies and neither Sanctified
[1:39:22] are all of One
[1:39:24] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:39:26] call them brethren
[1:39:28] you know you're in this verse it's not
[1:39:31] just talking about the past Believers
[1:39:32] it's talking about you amen because he
[1:39:34] that sanctifieth and they who have
[1:39:36] Sanctified are all of one they're all
[1:39:38] the same group so when Jesus died on
[1:39:40] Calvary it wasn't just for the Old
[1:39:42] Testament Saints and those right there
[1:39:43] it was for all the sins of the world
[1:39:46] all the way from Adam down to the end
[1:39:48] right all the way down through
[1:39:50] Hallelujah so all those that He
[1:39:52] sanctifieth
[1:39:53] they are Sanctified by him but he's not
[1:39:56] ashamed to call us Brethren see a
[1:39:58] Brethren is like brother sister how you
[1:40:00] doing
[1:40:01] we're part of each other it's not it's
[1:40:03] not CeCe we're joining us with Christ
[1:40:05] right so he lifts us out to be joint
[1:40:07] ears with him so when he calls us
[1:40:09] Brethren he doesn't put us down on some
[1:40:11] low pedestal somewhere you're down there
[1:40:13] I'm up here he says no we're brother and
[1:40:15] sister I'm not and he says I'm not
[1:40:18] ashamed to call you that
[1:40:20] he's not ashamed of any one of us
[1:40:22] with our Humanity with our failings even
[1:40:25] with things we may be going through
[1:40:27] right now that doesn't come into the
[1:40:29] equation
[1:40:30] I just like to lift the burden off our
[1:40:31] shoulders can we do that today
[1:40:33] amen because we get so caught up in our
[1:40:36] humanity and our failings God don't look
[1:40:37] at that amen he's not ashamed to call
[1:40:40] you a brother or sister he's not ashamed
[1:40:42] to say you're part of his family he's
[1:40:44] not ashamed of that
[1:40:45] Hallelujah I'm glad he's not ashamed of
[1:40:47] us you know you know he's not ashamed
[1:40:49] like yo the enemy comes along and he
[1:40:52] just tries to hide us away yo hope he
[1:40:54] doesn't see those ones
[1:40:55] you know just just go go into that room
[1:40:58] for a little bit you know no no he
[1:41:00] brings us out I'm proud of you that's
[1:41:04] actually what he says I'm proud of my
[1:41:06] children I'm proud of my family I'm not
[1:41:08] ashamed of any part of my family I'm
[1:41:10] proud of them all doesn't matter how old
[1:41:12] or young where they're from I'm proud of
[1:41:14] them all
[1:41:16] elujah
[1:41:17] praise God I'm so glad for that
[1:41:20] hallelujah amen saying I will declare
[1:41:22] thy name unto my brethren in the midst
[1:41:24] of the church will I sing praise unto
[1:41:25] thee and again I'll put my trust in him
[1:41:27] and again behold I am the children which
[1:41:29] God hath given me for as much then as
[1:41:31] the children up partake is the Flesh and
[1:41:33] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:41:35] of the same that through death he might
[1:41:37] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:41:38] that is the devil and deliver them who
[1:41:40] through fear of death
[1:41:42] where all their lifetimes subject to
[1:41:44] bondage reverely he took not on him the
[1:41:46] nature of angels but he took on him the
[1:41:48] Seed of Abraham
[1:41:50] amen you see see he he wasn't ashamed to
[1:41:53] be called
[1:41:54] Abraham is my seed
[1:41:56] that lineage is my seat you know I'm
[1:41:59] going to tie myself to the lineage
[1:42:00] because we know Mary Jesus was created
[1:42:03] in Mary's womb right amen she Jesus
[1:42:05] wasn't Jew or Gentile his God made flesh
[1:42:08] be it God would attribute himself coming
[1:42:10] to the Earth like that through these
[1:42:12] kind of people and through Rahab and
[1:42:14] Tamar and and all these different ones
[1:42:16] right Bashi but all these different ones
[1:42:18] God would that's why the lineage is
[1:42:20] there
[1:42:21] because God's saying I'm identifying
[1:42:23] myself with all these Believers down
[1:42:24] Through the Ages
[1:42:26] praise God
[1:42:28] and the reason David was a man after
[1:42:30] God's Own Heart is because he had a
[1:42:32] heart for God yes and he is quick to
[1:42:34] repent he acknowledged he was wrong and
[1:42:36] he wanted to be right
[1:42:38] right amen and you see
[1:42:40] many times we look at our mistakes
[1:42:43] and we let them beat us down
[1:42:45] brother Brown would have a it's called a
[1:42:47] private interview but it's recorded So
[1:42:48] I'm not sure how that works but he's
[1:42:50] having an interview with sister Bruce
[1:42:52] and she comes before brother Brown
[1:42:54] because she wants to know when she
[1:42:56] received the Holy Ghost she's believing
[1:42:57] God will give him a vision and he'll say
[1:42:59] it was this moment this time this
[1:43:01] happened now with sister Bruce she's
[1:43:03] actually in the message multiple times
[1:43:04] it's not just this one time you go
[1:43:06] search her out you'll see he says I've
[1:43:09] and and she says but I make so many
[1:43:10] mistakes and I fail so many times and
[1:43:13] brother says that's why Christ had to
[1:43:15] die so that you with your mistakes
[1:43:17] wouldn't be allotted to you see he took
[1:43:19] your mistakes your desire and your heart
[1:43:21] is to serve him
[1:43:23] who's that this morning amen you see see
[1:43:26] your desire see he looks at a desire
[1:43:28] and a real desire will be manifested
[1:43:31] because a lot of people say they want a
[1:43:33] lot of things but it's not it's just lip
[1:43:35] service but if you really want to serve
[1:43:37] him you'll serve him yeah if you really
[1:43:40] want to know him he'll meet you
[1:43:43] I mean if you really want to be part of
[1:43:45] him he'll bring you in
[1:43:48] see you're designing your heart as to
[1:43:49] serve him sister Bruce says yes all
[1:43:51] right that's what he died for you so you
[1:43:52] could serve him see your mistakes are
[1:43:54] not looked at not a lot of to you see
[1:43:57] here's your propitiation see here's your
[1:43:58] sin offering your sins are not known
[1:44:00] you're not a sinner before God Christ
[1:44:03] took your sins and became you because
[1:44:04] your desire is to serve him and sister
[1:44:07] Bruce says but I've never had an
[1:44:09] experience that they've been filled with
[1:44:10] the Holy Ghost I don't put my foot on
[1:44:12] sister Bruce here so I've you know I've
[1:44:14] repeated that next bit see never had an
[1:44:16] experience that I've been filled with
[1:44:18] the Holy Ghost I put my foot on all
[1:44:19] right notice this ordinarily a human
[1:44:21] being is born in sin shaped and iniquity
[1:44:23] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:44:25] the nature of a human being Sister Bruce
[1:44:26] is yes that was your nature it changed
[1:44:29] once what changed it she said Christ he
[1:44:32] says there you are sister see that's it
[1:44:34] so you can be so simple one day she was
[1:44:37] going this way she had to fall the
[1:44:39] nature of a human being then something
[1:44:41] turned her around all she wants to do is
[1:44:42] serve God and what now God begins to
[1:44:44] live out of her life what did that
[1:44:46] that's Christ he says that that was your
[1:44:48] moment that was your upper room
[1:44:50] experience that was when God filled you
[1:44:52] so you can be such a simple thing it
[1:44:54] says but I've got all these mistakes
[1:44:56] look at all these things I do wrong but
[1:44:58] because she wants to serve him
[1:45:01] those things aren't allotted to her
[1:45:03] because why he died on Calvary that her
[1:45:06] mistakes and sins are not allotted to
[1:45:08] her
[1:45:10] praise God he died on Calvary that we
[1:45:13] can serve him
[1:45:14] it's a good thing you think about that
[1:45:18] you say how could I serve the Lord well
[1:45:19] he died on Calvary so I could amen well
[1:45:21] then I can I'm coming Lord hello I'm
[1:45:24] going to walk with you Lord how am I
[1:45:26] going to walk with you Lord I died on
[1:45:27] Calvary that you could walk with me
[1:45:28] while I'm walking now Hallelujah Lord I
[1:45:31] want to talk to you how can I talk to
[1:45:32] you well I died on Calvary that I can
[1:45:33] talk to you and you can talk to me
[1:45:36] Hallelujah
[1:45:37] maybe I just get happy about simple
[1:45:39] things but it makes me happy you know so
[1:45:42] man because you wrestle maybe it's just
[1:45:44] me
[1:45:45] right
[1:45:46] so let's not beat ourselves up anymore
[1:45:49] but because because remember the devil
[1:45:51] used our own sincerity against us
[1:45:54] amen because you because it because the
[1:45:56] accuser comes along you say well you
[1:45:58] thought this and you did this and you
[1:45:59] shouldn't have done that and done that
[1:46:00] and the and he and he's right
[1:46:03] but because of the Devil he's wrong
[1:46:04] because his motive is wrong he doesn't
[1:46:06] want to he doesn't want to liberate you
[1:46:08] he just wants to tear you down
[1:46:11] but you see we've got to realize sure I
[1:46:13] made down all those things
[1:46:15] but Jesus but God rich and mercy came on
[1:46:18] the scene for me and he called me one
[1:46:20] day and he's walking with me today and
[1:46:23] I'm going to keep walking with him amen
[1:46:25] amen his blood is more than enough
[1:46:29] you think about David here
[1:46:32] David would be inspired to write a lot
[1:46:34] of Psalms
[1:46:35] remember this is the same David that
[1:46:36] killed took bathshebra in adultery
[1:46:38] killed her husband tried to cover it up
[1:46:41] by doing that marrying Bathsheba thought
[1:46:44] it was all sorted
[1:46:45] You Can't Hide sin
[1:46:48] can't hide soon
[1:46:50] but yeah here he is you think about that
[1:46:53] he has to live with the memory of what
[1:46:55] he's done
[1:46:57] but yet
[1:46:58] he would write blessed is he whose
[1:47:01] transgression Is Forgiven
[1:47:03] whose sin is covered blessed is the man
[1:47:06] unto whom the Lord and pewterth not
[1:47:07] iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no
[1:47:10] guile when I kept silence my bones waxed
[1:47:13] all through my roaring all the day long
[1:47:14] for day and night thy hand was Heavy
[1:47:17] upon me my moisture has turned into the
[1:47:19] drought of Summer Silla I acknowledge my
[1:47:21] sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not
[1:47:23] hit I said I will confess my
[1:47:25] transgression unto the Lord and thou
[1:47:27] forgave us the iniquity of my sin
[1:47:30] he did a lot of bad we say Lord blessed
[1:47:34] is the man
[1:47:35] he's actually saying he's blessed
[1:47:38] Lord You've forgiven my transgression
[1:47:41] you've covered my sins my iniquity is
[1:47:44] not imputed to me God yeah
[1:47:46] Hallelujah
[1:47:48] and God said I'm proud to say he's one
[1:47:50] of mine the accuser can come along look
[1:47:53] this is your Kinga you said this man was
[1:47:55] a man after your own heart so the devil
[1:47:57] try and point out our failures to God
[1:48:01] you know he says yeah because remember
[1:48:02] we're made in the image of God
[1:48:04] amen we have dominion over this earth
[1:48:06] right as the as the redeemed Sons and
[1:48:09] Daughters of Adam's Fallen race we have
[1:48:11] dominion over the devil over everything
[1:48:14] Jesus conquered we have dominion because
[1:48:16] he got Dominion for us over it right but
[1:48:19] then but then the accuser comes along
[1:48:21] and says to God but God I thought you
[1:48:23] said they're made in your image I
[1:48:25] thought you said they've been restored
[1:48:26] back to the original faith
[1:48:28] I thought you said you dwell on them
[1:48:29] look at what they do
[1:48:31] look at what they do now God doesn't say
[1:48:33] don't mention them
[1:48:34] put you in the cupboard somewhere says
[1:48:36] no no I am not ashamed to call them
[1:48:38] brethren I'm proud to say yes they are
[1:48:41] my sons and daughters you know the devil
[1:48:43] has all these accusations but all those
[1:48:44] accusations actually fall silent in the
[1:48:46] court of God because the blood of Jesus
[1:48:49] Christ annuls takes away all those
[1:48:51] things
[1:48:52] Hallelujah
[1:48:55] amen we're just going to read a couple
[1:48:57] more and here he is walking in the midst
[1:48:59] of Those whom he has redeemed even as
[1:49:01] church and what were those who were
[1:49:03] redeemed were not many like Paul
[1:49:05] murderers and corrupters were not many
[1:49:07] like the dying Thief robbers and Men
[1:49:09] Killers all trophies of his grace all
[1:49:11] brought back from the dead all made
[1:49:13] alive in Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:49:15] Hallelujah God's not ashamed of any of
[1:49:18] them
[1:49:18] he's not ashamed of us
[1:49:22] praise God
[1:49:24] amen so I trust we have come to a point
[1:49:26] in our walk with his
[1:49:28] there's more we identify more with
[1:49:30] Heaven than this world
[1:49:33] and he would say in John 14 this is
[1:49:35] actually my final slide let not your
[1:49:37] heart be troubled but you believe in God
[1:49:39] live also in me in my father's house and
[1:49:41] many mansions if it were not so I would
[1:49:43] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:49:45] for you and if I go prepare a place for
[1:49:47] you I'll come again and receive you unto
[1:49:48] myself that Ryan he may be also whether
[1:49:51] I go you know and the way you know
[1:49:53] Thomas adlington Lord we know not
[1:49:56] whether they'll go us and how can we
[1:49:58] know the way Jesus saith unto him I am
[1:50:00] the way the truth and the life no man
[1:50:02] cometh unto the father but by me so he
[1:50:05] says I in my father's house my father's
[1:50:07] kingdom are many mansions many houses
[1:50:08] and we know these are bodies right we're
[1:50:11] going to dwell in if they're not so I
[1:50:12] would have told you I go to prepare a
[1:50:14] place for you and if I go prepare a
[1:50:16] place for you I will come again and
[1:50:17] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:50:19] it's not where we are where he is ye may
[1:50:22] be also see it comes a time when the
[1:50:25] Lord returns to receive his children
[1:50:27] back to himself to carry them away
[1:50:31] praise the Lord what does this message
[1:50:33] come to do to receive you you say with
[1:50:36] my failures with my mistakes with my
[1:50:38] Humanity remember Jesus died on Calvary
[1:50:40] those things wouldn't be allotted to you
[1:50:41] you're sin everything anything that will
[1:50:44] stop you going to the presence of God
[1:50:45] the blood takes care of
[1:50:47] Hallelujah so he has come to receive you
[1:50:51] unto himself
[1:50:52] and that's why you begin to think about
[1:50:54] heaven that's why you begin to think
[1:50:56] about the Rapture that's why you begin
[1:50:57] to think about meeting him in the air
[1:50:59] why because you've realized I'm looking
[1:51:01] for a city whose build and maker is God
[1:51:03] why because he's come to receive you
[1:51:05] unto himself to carry you away
