[4:46] there in the midst, Lord. And Lord, we

[24:13] Thanks, musicians. Amen. Good evening,
[24:16] everyone. Good to see everyone here
[24:18] tonight. Amen. God bless you all. Amen.
[24:20] We're going to turn to the scripture
[24:22] tonight. Amen. We're going to go to
[24:24] um I want to go
[24:27] to Job chapter 38. Read a couple of
[24:31] familiar scriptures here. So, sorry I
[24:34] don't have a slideshow. I know. Again,
[24:36] um Job 38 and we're going to read verses
[24:41] 3-7. And then we're going to go to
[24:43] Revelations 13 and verse 8. Just going
[24:45] to read that one verse
[24:52] there. Amen. Everyone everyone well
[24:54] tonight? Everyone good? Happy to be in
[24:57] the house of the Lord. Amen. Praise the
[25:00] Lord. Amen. So this is the Lord
[25:02] answering answering Job
[25:05] here. He says, "Good up now thy loins
[25:08] like a man, for I demand of thee an
[25:10] answer and answer thou me. Where was
[25:12] thou when I laid the foundations of the
[25:14] earth? Declare if thou hast
[25:16] understanding. Who hath laid the
[25:18] measures thereof, if thou knowest, or
[25:19] who hath stretched out the lines upon
[25:21] it? Whereupon are the foundations
[25:23] thereof fastened? Or who laid the
[25:25] cornerstone thereof? When the morning
[25:28] stars sang together, and all the sons of
[25:30] God shouted for joy. Praise the Lord.
[25:33] And we're just going to go to
[25:34] Revelations 13 and verse 8, just one uh
[25:37] one verse here. And um Amen. And then
[25:41] we're going to Amen. So, Revelations 13
[25:43] and:e
[25:44] 8, very applicable, of course, to the
[25:47] age and time that we live. It says here,
[25:53] um, this is incredible scripture. You
[25:55] think about it. The whole world, all
[25:58] that dwell upon the earth, that's a lot
[26:00] of people. That's a lot of, but there's
[26:03] a group that
[26:04] won't. and all that dwell upon the earth
[26:07] shall worship him whose names are not
[26:09] written in the book of of life of the
[26:10] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[26:14] world. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a
[26:16] word of prayer. Amen. We've got one
[26:17] particular need uh tonight. Um
[26:19] Christine's grandma Nancy is in
[26:22] hospital, double pneumonia, had a heart
[26:24] attack this afternoon. She's not
[26:25] apparently she's bouncing back, but keep
[26:27] her in prayer. And if you have a need,
[26:28] you just want to slip your hand up to
[26:29] the Lord. Say, "Lord, remember me."
[26:31] Amen. And let's pray. Gracious Father,
[26:34] Lord, we desire more than anything that
[26:37] you'd have your way in us. Have your way
[26:38] in me, Lord Jesus. Come and live, Lord.
[26:40] Be glorified in our lives, Lord, as we
[26:43] walk this, Lord, this pilgrimage along
[26:45] this earth until you take us home.
[26:46] Father, we want to just come before you
[26:49] this night, Lord, with thanksgiving,
[26:50] Lord, that you are alive, Lord. You're
[26:52] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[26:54] Lord. It thrills our soul, Lord, to know
[26:56] that you're not a God of history, Lord,
[26:57] but you're the present I am, Lord.
[26:59] you're here to fulfill your word, Lord,
[27:00] and to watch over our lives and to fill
[27:03] your word in our lives, Lord. And I
[27:04] pray, Father, for the service. May you
[27:06] come, Lord. We've read your word, Lord.
[27:08] But we need you, the great author, Lord,
[27:09] the great author of the book to step
[27:11] forth and anoint your word, Lord. Anoint
[27:13] both speaker and hearer, Lord. Touch
[27:15] every life. And we especially want to
[27:17] remember, Lord, Sister Nancy up in
[27:18] Taranga, dear God. Father, in hospital,
[27:21] not in a good way, but Lord, we lift her
[27:23] into your presence by prayer, praying
[27:24] you'd touch her body and raise her up,
[27:26] dear God. Father, give her strength. And
[27:28] I so thankful that you are her God,
[27:30] Lord. You're her shepherd, Lord. Father,
[27:32] you're there with her in the hospital,
[27:33] Lord. So may you continue to bless her
[27:34] and keep her there. We thank you,
[27:36] Father. Raise her up for your good
[27:37] pleasure, Lord. All the other needs that
[27:39] are behind our upraised hands, Lord. May
[27:41] you meet them, Lord, according to your
[27:42] riches and glory, Lord. We submit all of
[27:44] our needs at your feet now. And we thank
[27:46] you for the answer, Lord, in Jesus
[27:48] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[27:51] you. You can uh have your seats tonight.
[27:53] So I want to I want to talk about the uh
[27:57] uh the before you know brother Brandham
[28:00] speaks about how there was a you know he
[28:01] was at a Pentecostal meeting and uh you
[28:03] know early in his ministry there's an
[28:05] old man got up and you know everyone was
[28:06] preaching about what happened down upon
[28:08] the earth but then an old brother got up
[28:10] and said I'm going to preach to you
[28:11] about what happened up in heaven before
[28:13] anything ever started. So, we're going
[28:14] to kind of go along the horizontal
[28:16] rainbow. God, you know, Lord willing,
[28:18] and then uh, you know, I think maybe
[28:19] we'll have a jubilee because I think
[28:21] it's very important that when we look at
[28:22] life, we really kind of zoom out, you
[28:24] know, cuz life is full of instances and
[28:26] troubles and particular moments. And if
[28:29] we if we forget the big picture in the
[28:31] moment, we kind of miss the whole
[28:32] picture, you know, like we read that or
[28:34] we sung that song, um, you know, uh, I'm
[28:37] fighting a battle, you've already won.
[28:39] And this is just me. I like to sing it.
[28:41] I know what you're doing because I know
[28:43] what you've done. Amen. What did he do?
[28:44] He purchased my salvation on Calvary. He
[28:46] has redeemed me by his blood. So
[28:48] therefore, everything I'm going through,
[28:50] every battle, every trial is to mold me
[28:52] and shape me. This that that his
[28:54] character is formed in my life. So I can
[28:56] say, I know what you're doing, Lord,
[28:58] because you're you're using this
[29:00] particular moment to reveal yourself to
[29:02] form your character in me, Lord. So I
[29:05] know what you're doing. Amen. Amen.
[29:07] That's how I like to sing it. That's me.
[29:08] Amen. But you know, cuz I know what
[29:10] you've done. Amen. So here we have Job
[29:12] and I find it very interesting as Job is
[29:14] standing there or you know sitting on
[29:16] his ash heap and his friends have been
[29:18] accusing him and they've gone back and
[29:20] forth and back and forth and then
[29:22] finally the Lord himself steps into the
[29:24] conversation. It's interesting that God
[29:27] never tells him look Job the reason
[29:29] you're going through this is because I
[29:30] had a testimony meeting with your enemy
[29:33] and my enemy he came up before my
[29:34] throne. You know, Satan came up before
[29:36] God's throne and you know, God pointed
[29:38] Job out to the enemy saying, "You're a
[29:40] perfect man." And so God never told Job,
[29:42] "Listen, Job, our enemy came up before
[29:45] me and I pointed you out to him and I
[29:48] declared what I see in you, Job, that
[29:50] you're a perfect man. And the whole
[29:51] reason that you've gone through this
[29:52] great calamity and loss, and you've lost
[29:54] your children, your livestock, and you
[29:56] now broke out in boils, and all these
[29:59] things, the very reason this has
[30:00] happened is because there's a contest
[30:02] between me and Satan." Amen. But you
[30:05] know, but he never explained it like
[30:06] that. He just began to ask Job, "Where
[30:08] were you in the beginning? Where were
[30:10] you when I laid the foundation of the
[30:12] world? Where were you when I put down
[30:13] the cornerstone and I begin to build
[30:15] everything and the morning stars shouted
[30:17] and the sons of God shouted for joy,
[30:20] where were you, Job?" So he doesn't
[30:21] explain to Job in the particular moment
[30:23] what's going on. But he gets Job to look
[30:26] back before there was a foundation. Job,
[30:28] you were in me, Job. Amen. And he and he
[30:31] and and I believe the reason he answers
[30:33] this way is because he wants you to see
[30:34] it's more than the moment of life you're
[30:36] in. I mean, it's more than the battle
[30:38] you're facing. It's more than the
[30:39] trouble you're looking at. More than the
[30:41] giants in your life or whatever the
[30:43] obstacle or thing that you're going
[30:44] through. It's more than that. Amen. It's
[30:47] the before that matters. Amen. Because
[30:49] where you started is where you're going
[30:51] to end. Amen. So if you started in the
[30:53] mind of God, you're going back to God.
[30:55] Amen. So if you started in eternity,
[30:57] you're going back to eternity. Amen. And
[30:59] that's the reason this message found you
[31:01] as God is telling you, listen, you came
[31:03] from my mind. You're expressed in time.
[31:05] Now you're going back to me. Hallelujah.
[31:08] So Job, you know, God was telling Job,
[31:11] Job, you were there before the
[31:14] foundation of the world. Job, you're in
[31:15] my mind. You're in my thinking. And Job,
[31:18] I didn't see you on the ash heap. You
[31:20] know, when I thought of you, Job, I
[31:21] didn't see you as you are in this
[31:23] particular moment in time. Because we'll
[31:25] have our ups and downs. We'll have our
[31:27] trials. We'll have our days where we
[31:29] think all is lost or how I could ever be
[31:31] saved and all these different things.
[31:33] And we'll have our moments on the
[31:34] mountain and in the valley, but you got
[31:36] to go beyond those things. Amen. That's
[31:38] why God told Job, Job, you were
[31:40] shouting, rejoicing when I was building
[31:43] everything. Amen. You watched me do it
[31:44] in my mind. Amen. So, so God was telling
[31:47] Job, listen, Job, before this trial ever
[31:50] came, you were shouting. Amen. So, what
[31:52] you're going through in time, remember,
[31:53] Brother Bram says that time is a little
[31:55] hickey on eternity, right? So it goes a
[31:58] perfect circle. Then there's a hickey.
[31:59] There's a bump. But eventually the bump
[32:01] comes to an end and eternity rolls on.
[32:03] Amen. So as we go from eternity through
[32:06] this hickey of time, we're going back
[32:07] into eternity again. Amen. When God
[32:10] eradicates sin, gets rid of the devil,
[32:12] burns it all up, and he pulls this
[32:13] hickey back into a perfect circle of
[32:15] eternity rolling on. Because you know
[32:17] what I love about God is because you
[32:19] know, before there ever was an enemy,
[32:22] there was a remedy. Amen. Before there
[32:25] ever was a problem, there was a
[32:26] solution. Before there ever ever was a
[32:28] sickness, there was a healing. Amen.
[32:30] Before there's ever a, you know,
[32:32] something lost, there was a savior.
[32:34] Before there ever was a trouble, there
[32:36] was a solution. Before there ever was a
[32:38] devil, amen, there was God. Amen. And as
[32:40] all conquering power within him. Before
[32:42] the enemy ever became the enemy, God was
[32:45] God. And before the devil ever came into
[32:48] existence, you were in God's mind. Amen.
[32:50] You were before the devil. Amen. You
[32:52] weren't after the devil. you were before
[32:54] him. Amen. As God's thoughts. Now, it's
[32:57] amazing how the devil, he tries to
[32:59] change things in time. What God has
[33:01] already done in eternity. That's
[33:03] impossible. What God has done in
[33:06] eternity will continue to be back into
[33:08] eternity. It doesn't matter how bad it
[33:10] gets in time. There's nothing the devil
[33:12] can do against God's eternal thoughts
[33:15] that can stop those thoughts coming to
[33:16] manifestation. Amen. To live out what it
[33:19] says it is. Amen. So I say friends,
[33:21] you're going to look at yourself and say
[33:22] I'm an eternal eternal thought of God.
[33:26] Amen. I'm part of his book. I'm part of
[33:28] him. Amen. I'm I'm just an expression of
[33:30] his word in this end time. Amen. So So
[33:33] if I was the eternal thought of God and
[33:35] God thought of me rejoicing, shouting
[33:38] round the throne, worshiping him. Amen.
[33:42] There's nothing the devil can do in time
[33:44] that can stop me going back into what
[33:46] God thought me to be. Amen. It's like
[33:48] the woman at the well. Amen. The Lord
[33:50] Jesus went by his way of Samaria. You
[33:52] know, he said to his disciples, I need
[33:54] to go to Samaria. Why? Cuz he had an
[33:56] attribute that he saw before the
[33:58] foundation world shouting. That was the
[34:00] woman at the well. Now, as the woman at
[34:01] the well in her in her state before the
[34:04] Messiah came her way, she wasn't
[34:06] expressing the worship that he saw her
[34:08] do before the foundation of the world.
[34:10] But then God, Jesus, you know, our Lord
[34:12] Jesus went by her way and began to speak
[34:14] to her about her life and reveal to her
[34:16] who he was. That's why you know she said
[34:18] we know where Messiah cometh he will
[34:20] tell us all things and he said plainly I
[34:22] am he. Amen. So what happened is God God
[34:26] found her in this state of broken you
[34:29] know broken cycles of trying to find
[34:31] love in all the wrong places and
[34:32] rejection and hurt and pain and broken
[34:34] hearts. That was the condition he found
[34:37] her in. But when he thought of her, she
[34:40] wasn't in that condition. Amen. So how
[34:42] he thought of her was not how uh was
[34:44] exactly how she was going to end up.
[34:46] Yeah. Hallelujah. Are you with me? I
[34:48] trust I'm not getting that back to front
[34:49] cuz I know I'm, you know, it's what I
[34:52] mean sometimes, not what I say cuz
[34:53] sometimes it's all back to front, you
[34:55] know. But you know what I mean. He saw
[34:57] her shouting, rejoicing when he laid the
[35:00] foundations of the world. When he found
[35:02] her in time, she wasn't in that
[35:04] condition yet, but her soul was was
[35:07] ordained to be in that condition. So
[35:08] when the Lord Jesus spoke to her, said
[35:10] that the father seeketh such to worship
[35:12] him in spirit and in truth. Amen. So
[35:15] basically he was saying to her, "Listen,
[35:17] the father's seeking you. This is why
[35:19] I've come to you." Amen. Because you're
[35:21] a true worshshiper of God. You don't
[35:23] know it yet, but this is who you truly
[35:24] are. Amen. That's why the word came open
[35:27] to her and she saw that this is the
[35:29] Messiah, more than a prophet, more than
[35:31] a healing campaign, more than a church,
[35:33] more than a nice doctrine. It's Messiah
[35:35] himself came her way. And her eyes came
[35:38] said, "We have found the Messiah has
[35:40] found me." What did she turn into? what
[35:43] she was meant to be a worshshiper in
[35:46] spirit and in truth.
[35:49] Hallelujah. You know, you're that woman
[35:51] at the well. Amen. You think about
[35:53] you're that woman at the well. Amen. Cuz
[35:54] when God thought of you, he thought of
[35:57] you shouting, rejoicing, praising his
[36:00] name. That's what he thought of you.
[36:02] Amen. So how he thought of you, how you
[36:04] started is how you're going to end.
[36:06] Amen. You're not going to end up in a
[36:08] different way. It doesn't matter what
[36:09] the devil tries to do to you. Amen. And
[36:11] he did a lot of damage to her life. But
[36:13] that damage was temporal. It was an
[36:15] eternal work. Amen. It could not be
[36:17] eternal. It was a temporal thing that
[36:19] had to be changed. Amen. Cuz how God
[36:21] thought of her, he said, "I'm going to
[36:22] make her how I thought of her." Amen. So
[36:24] as soon as she saw Messiah, she dropped
[36:26] her water pot, dropped her old life, and
[36:28] she became a worshshiper in spirit and
[36:30] in truth. Hallelujah.
[36:34] Praise our God. Amen. And the devil
[36:37] can't change what God has done in
[36:39] eternity because before there ever was
[36:41] sickness, there was healing. I just want
[36:43] to you think about now because he was
[36:45] slain before the foundation of the
[36:47] world. So God before the foundation of
[36:48] the world slew the lamb. And when he
[36:50] slew the lamb, he wrote your name in his
[36:52] book. Amen. Let's go to um Luke chapter
[36:56] 10, shall we? Amen. Because to
[37:01] me, if if the Lord can just drop it in
[37:04] our heart maybe a little bit more, I
[37:07] come from him. I'm going back to him.
[37:09] I'm part of him. My name's on his book
[37:12] and nothing can take it off. Hallelujah.
[37:15] Then then I believe it'll give us his
[37:17] greatest stability in
[37:20] life. Amen. Now, so Luke Luke chapter
[37:25] 10 and from verse 17.
[37:29] Now Luke 10:17, we're over here. Luke
[37:32] 10. Yes.
[37:33] 17-22. He says, "And the 70 returned
[37:36] again with joy." So the Lord Jesus has
[37:38] sent them out to cast out devils, heal
[37:40] the sick, raise the dead. Right. So now
[37:41] they come back and they've and and and
[37:44] you returned again with joy, saying,
[37:46] "Lord, even the devils are subject unto
[37:48] us through thy name." And he said unto
[37:50] them, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[37:53] from heaven." And brother Ram says that
[37:55] as the church was endued with power,
[37:57] Satan fell from a position. As the
[37:59] church is being raised up in power, he
[38:01] says, "Behold, I give you power to chew
[38:02] on serpent uh serpents and scorpions and
[38:05] over all the power of the enemy, and
[38:07] nothing shall by anyone uh means hurt
[38:09] you. Notwithstanding in this, rejoice
[38:11] not that spirits are subject unto you,
[38:14] but rather rejoice because your names
[38:16] are written in heaven." So, he's
[38:19] basically saying, "Yes, sure, rejoice."
[38:20] He's saying, don't just rejoice in this.
[38:23] There's a greater thing for you to
[38:24] rejoice in. So don't just rejoice in the
[38:26] temporal victories. Amen. Rejoice in the
[38:29] eternal things. Amen. That your names
[38:31] are written in heaven. Now, I understand
[38:33] Judas was there. I understand his name
[38:35] was taken off God's book, but his name
[38:37] wasn't on the lamb's book of life. It
[38:39] was just on the book of life. Let's not
[38:41] dwell on the negative. Let's dwell on
[38:42] the positive. Our names are written on
[38:44] the lamb's book of life. Amen. And
[38:47] nothing the devil can do can scrub that
[38:49] name off. I say even even to the elect,
[38:52] there's nothing the elect can do that
[38:54] can scrub their name off the book. That
[38:57] may be a strong statement, but I believe
[38:58] it's true. Amen. Because God cannot God
[39:01] cannot take a name off his elected book.
[39:03] Amen. What his if he's put your name in
[39:07] his lamb's book of life, it it will
[39:10] remain. And you'll come to a place in
[39:12] your life where you realize my name is
[39:14] written in heaven. Amen. So that before
[39:17] the enemy ever was, Amen. I was.
[39:20] Hallelujah. So he says, "Rejoice that
[39:22] your names are written in heaven." Don't
[39:24] rejoice that the you know spirits are
[39:26] subject to you, but rather rejoice
[39:27] because your names are written in
[39:29] heaven. Amen. To show that yo, we should
[39:32] rejoice in the fact that before there
[39:33] ever was a devil. I know I'm repeating
[39:35] myself. I want this to anchor in. Before
[39:36] there ever was an enemy, I was. Amen. So
[39:40] there's nothing the devil can do because
[39:42] remember, if I was before him, I'm going
[39:44] to be after him. Amen. Because there'll
[39:46] come a time where the accuser of the
[39:48] brethren is burnt up, destroyed. He's no
[39:50] more. Amen. He can't accuse no more.
[39:52] He's in the lake of fire. And then he
[39:54] will be eradicated into nothing. But
[39:56] after that moment, I still will be.
[39:59] Amen. He will be no more, but I will
[40:01] still be. Amen. I'll be praising God,
[40:03] rejoicing around the throne, but our
[40:05] enemy will be destroyed. He'll be
[40:06] nothing.
[40:08] Hallelujah. Amen. I think we can rejoice
[40:10] in this. we can, you know, because we're
[40:13] to see that the that that that God's
[40:15] redeeming grace is so great upon you and
[40:18] I. It is so great. It's not a little
[40:21] thing. It's a very great thing. Amen.
[40:23] Because remember Job when you know God
[40:26] God showed Job um you know the morning
[40:29] stars shouting, the sons of God singing
[40:31] for joy. Amen. God was showing Job not
[40:34] only who he was, but also he's showing
[40:36] him the oldest religion that there ever
[40:38] is. Amen. We don't have some fandangled
[40:40] new thing going on. Shouting, rejoicing,
[40:43] praising God. It's the oldest religion
[40:45] there is. Amen. A genuine eternal
[40:47] shouting, praising God, worshiping God
[40:49] and spirit and truth religion. That's
[40:51] the oldest one. That's the only true
[40:52] kind there is. Amen. Amen. The
[40:54] intellectual understanding one. It ain't
[40:56] the original one. No. The revelation in
[40:58] your heart burning. You praise God
[41:00] because of that. Amen. That's the
[41:02] original one. Hallelujah. Amen. I don't
[41:05] have the scripture on me, but if you
[41:06] read when Solomon dedicates the temple,
[41:09] it would speak about those ones who play
[41:11] instruments and things and and it said
[41:12] that David furnished those men, those
[41:15] instruments. And then it says that and
[41:17] then then David, he said he said he said
[41:20] David was praised or the praise of David
[41:22] came through those people. That's what
[41:24] the scripture says. Amen. Now, we don't
[41:26] The praise of King David doesn't come
[41:29] through us, but the the praise of the
[41:31] son of David, Jesus Christ, comes
[41:34] through his people. Amen. Why? Cuz we've
[41:36] been furnished with garments of praise.
[41:38] Amen. Not a temporary garment. Amen. But
[41:40] an eternal garment. Amen. We've been
[41:42] we've been dressed. Amen. That your God
[41:45] is God has changed our vocal cords just
[41:47] right. Amen. To make us sound pleasing
[41:49] unto him. Hallelujah. Hey, you could
[41:52] sing like me, but God still loves it if
[41:54] it's under the blood. Amen. Why? Cuz
[41:56] he's given us the right chords. He's
[41:58] given us the right instrument. Amen.
[42:00] Why? Cuz he's cleansed us. He's
[42:02] furnished us. Amen. That his praise
[42:05] would be manifested through us.
[42:07] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, I got
[42:09] nothing." No, you got everything. Amen.
[42:12] You've been furnished to praise the
[42:13] Lord. You've been dressed to praise him.
[42:15] Amen. You've been made to praise him.
[42:17] That's what you've been built to do.
[42:18] Amen. that God would make a people that
[42:20] worship him not out of a not out of a um
[42:24] a job like the angels, but out of love,
[42:27] but out of a relationship, out of
[42:29] revelation. Never ever let the devil
[42:32] diminish the revelation God's put in
[42:34] your soul. Amen. Where you're a son or
[42:36] daughter of God, God's redeemed you.
[42:37] Amen. Calvary is no longer a story. It's
[42:40] a reality. Amen. That the blood was
[42:42] real. Amen. That you know he rose out of
[42:44] the tomb because he's given you the Holy
[42:46] Ghost. Hallelujah. Never let the devil
[42:48] diminish that in your heart. Amen. No,
[42:49] it's a reality. Amen. And with that, you
[42:51] can worship God in spirit and in truth.
[42:54] Hallelujah. We have a right to worship
[42:56] God. You say, "I don't feel like it. It
[42:58] don't matter what you feel." Amen. Cuz
[43:00] that's why God wanted Job to see Job.
[43:03] You're feeling down. You're feeling in
[43:04] pain. You're feeling lost. All these
[43:06] troubles and things. But Job, look
[43:08] beyond that. Where were you, Job? Amen.
[43:11] Because we don't worship God based on
[43:13] our feelings. See, see, God wants us to
[43:15] walk by faith, not by feelings, not by
[43:18] imagination, not by reasoning. Faith is
[43:20] not reasonable to the carnal mind. It is
[43:23] not reasonable. You see, if we went by
[43:25] reason, would we say, "Well, I'm too
[43:26] tired. I'm too I'm too busy. I'm too
[43:29] this. I'm too that." But we cast down
[43:31] that reasoning. Or, "I feel sore. I feel
[43:34] tired. I feel distracted." Put those
[43:36] things to one side. I mean, I don't I
[43:38] don't walk with those. See, there's a
[43:40] pressure always to walk with those
[43:42] things because the five senses declare a
[43:44] lot of things. But we're here to walk by
[43:47] faith. We're here to worship by
[43:49] revelation, by faith, not by what the
[43:52] five senses declare. Amen. Because
[43:54] remember the five, remember your your
[43:55] feelings will go up and down like the
[43:57] weather. It'll be worse than the weather
[43:59] in Oakuckland. It changes four seasons
[44:01] in one day. If you've ever lived there,
[44:03] you know what I'm talking about. I live
[44:04] there. I know what I'm talking about.
[44:05] Right? But you see, it'll change up and
[44:06] down. happy, sad, lost, found,
[44:08] rejoicing, defeated, whatever. That's
[44:10] your feelings, right? But you got to go
[44:12] beyond the feelings and go and God says,
[44:14] "Where were you?" Hallelujah. You are
[44:17] with me. Amen. That's why the Holy Ghost
[44:20] has come upon your life is God is
[44:22] showing you you're my child. Hallelujah.
[44:25] Amen. It is your faith confirmed. Amen.
[44:28] Just like Abraham's faith was confirmed
[44:30] by circumcision. So God, he doesn't give
[44:33] us that circumcision. He gives us a
[44:35] circumcision of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So
[44:37] that what is that? That's God confirming
[44:39] your faith. Amen. So if God's confirmed
[44:42] my faith, if he's received my faith,
[44:44] Amen. And he gave me that faith, how can
[44:46] I ever be lost? He's confirmed, my
[44:49] child, your destination is sure.
[44:52] Hallelujah. Your destination is sure.
[44:54] Sure, you have your ups and downs and
[44:56] lefts and rights and troubles, but your
[44:58] destination is sure. Amen. Cuz I have
[45:01] received your faith that I gave you in
[45:02] the beginning.
[45:04] So, where were you? Well, I've had a
[45:07] week, but where were you? Before the
[45:10] foundation of the world. That's why this
[45:12] message has gripped your life because
[45:14] God is telling you, you were with me.
[45:16] Amen. Because he's looking for his
[45:18] attributes. He's looking for his people.
[45:21] Hallelujah. This makes me happy. This
[45:24] makes me happy because sometimes I don't
[45:26] feel like it. Sometimes I do, but you
[45:28] know, you know, sometimes the devil pins
[45:30] you in a corner, but hey, you just God
[45:31] says, "Where were you? This trial is not
[45:34] who you are. The trials aren't here to
[45:36] identify you. You're not you're not
[45:39] defined by your trials. You're defined
[45:41] by the word of God. Amen. By what he's
[45:44] done in your life, you know, by who you
[45:45] are in him rather. That you know, that's
[45:47] who you are. You're a son and daughter
[45:48] of God, right? Praise the Lord. So
[45:50] before there was a devil, our names are
[45:52] written in the lamb's book of life.
[45:53] Brother Bram says there's the devil does
[45:55] not have enough rubbing compound to rub
[45:57] our names off that book. Amen. So how?
[46:00] Because you say, "Well, how do I know my
[46:01] name's on the book?" God put a faith in
[46:03] your soul that says this word is true.
[46:06] Amen.
[46:08] Praise the Lord. I think we could just
[46:09] go shouting for a while now. Amen.
[46:11] Because you got to realize why did why
[46:13] why is this message alive to you? It's
[46:15] more than being raised in it. Because
[46:16] there's got to come a time where the
[46:18] light turns on. The fire falls. Amen.
[46:20] And God begins to move in your life and
[46:22] you see, hey, this is not my daddy or
[46:24] mommy's religion. This is my religion.
[46:25] Amen. This is my walk with God. Not
[46:27] their walk with God. This is my walk
[46:29] with God. Hallelujah. Amen. You know
[46:32] what I love about the um you know
[46:35] there's Let's go to Romans chapter 3.
[46:37] How we doing? We're doing okay. Let's
[46:39] let's go to Romans chapter 3. I think we
[46:41] should just plow into these things.
[46:42] Amen. You look at you know look how good
[46:44] the Lord is. Amen. Where were you before
[46:47] you you were there? I don't remember it.
[46:49] Yeah. We were in his mind. That's how
[46:51] God thought of you. That's why when the
[46:54] spirit of God begins to move on your
[46:55] life, you begin to read the word. It
[46:56] comes alive. There's a praise comes out.
[46:59] Holy or what? He's actually God showing
[47:01] you a glimpse of what you were before
[47:03] the foundation of the
[47:04] world. Amen.
[47:07] Where are we? Romans 3
[47:11] 24:25. Are we in three? Yes. 24:25. Whom
[47:15] God hath set forth. Sorry, 24. I was
[47:19] reading 25. 24. being justified freely
[47:22] by his grace through the redemption that
[47:24] is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set
[47:27] forth to be a propitiation through faith
[47:29] in his blood to declare his
[47:31] righteousness for the remission of sins
[47:33] that are passed through the forbearance
[47:36] of God. Now I like that I like that
[47:39] first verse we read there being
[47:40] justified freely by his grace. Now when
[47:44] God when God asked Job where you were he
[47:48] told he says you were with me Job in my
[47:51] mind. Now brother makes a statement
[47:52] about being
[47:53] justified. He says justification is far
[47:56] more than if you heard me just say you
[47:58] heard heard that I went drinking and I
[48:00] did this and did that and then you came
[48:02] and talked to me about it and I said no
[48:05] I never did that. And then you'd say to
[48:07] me well I forgive you. And you say well
[48:09] for what do you mean forgive me? I never
[48:11] did it in the first place. I'm justified
[48:14] now. Where is the first place? See, the
[48:16] first place isn't in time. The first
[48:18] place isn't when you were born or when
[48:21] you hit age of accountability. The first
[48:23] place is in the mind of God. I never did
[48:26] it in the first place. I never did it
[48:28] when he when he when he thought of me
[48:30] before the foundation of the world. He
[48:32] saw me justified, sinless, perfect, made
[48:36] in his image. That's how he saw me.
[48:38] Amen. So justification reveals you never
[48:40] did it in the first place. He said how
[48:42] God thought of you before the foundation
[48:44] of the world. That is what justification
[48:46] shows.
[48:48] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It's
[48:50] more than just being forgiven. Sure, we
[48:51] are freely forgiven. But it's deeper
[48:54] than just because if you're forgiven,
[48:55] that means there's still evidence that
[48:57] can be against you. But if you're
[49:00] justified, you never did there because
[49:02] you never did it. Right? It's like if
[49:04] you heard me speeding down the road at
[49:07] 160, but I never did it. Doesn't matter
[49:10] how much, you know, accusation came
[49:12] against me. If I never did it, if I was
[49:14] never there, then I never did it. I
[49:18] trust this is going across tonight.
[49:20] Amen. So, he's saying, "You never did it
[49:22] in the first place." Well, where were
[49:23] you in the first place? Shouting for joy
[49:26] in the mind of God. Hallelujah.
[49:29] Never. Well, you say, "Well, what's got
[49:31] to happen with sin then?" Well, what I
[49:33] love about sin is is it's got to be
[49:35] answered for. I remember. You see, the
[49:37] thing is what the blood does is is is it
[49:40] takes the sin that was done in time and
[49:44] it transfers it the blood transfers it
[49:46] off your account onto the account of the
[49:49] devil. Amen. We can see this in a very
[49:52] brief scene here when when when God
[49:53] calls Adam and Eve and the serpent to
[49:55] judgment, right? God starts off with
[49:58] Adam. Adam blame blames Eve. Eve blames
[50:02] the serpent. The serpent turns and he's
[50:04] got no one to blame. It all comes upon
[50:07] him, right? And then God closed Adam and
[50:09] Eve saying, "I'm going to undo what has
[50:11] happened here this day." Amen. But but
[50:13] but who does not walk away with a
[50:16] covering? The serpent. Amen. Why?
[50:20] Because the serpent had to wear what
[50:22] what what was done through him in the
[50:24] garden. Amen. So now we have this old
[50:27] serpent, the dragon. Amen. That that is
[50:30] the cause of every sin that's ever
[50:31] struck the human race. Because sin
[50:33] started in heaven in his heart. Before
[50:36] he became the dragon, he was he was
[50:38] Lucifer, right? The son of the morning.
[50:39] Then he fell, became the dragon. So sin
[50:42] started in his heart and then it spread
[50:44] through creation. So who's going to
[50:46] answer for everything? He is.
[50:49] He is. Amen. Why? Because now he's going
[50:52] to have to give an account. Remember,
[50:54] he's the accuser of the brethren. So he
[50:56] accuses you things you've done. brings
[50:59] memories, brings imaginations, brings
[51:01] your conscience, brings all kinds of
[51:03] things, tries to drag you down by them.
[51:06] Well, he does that to me. Okay? You see,
[51:08] why? Because he's the accuser of the
[51:10] brethren. That's his job. Tries to
[51:12] condemn you by things that you've put
[51:14] under the blood, right? Remember,
[51:17] because it just takes an honest
[51:18] confession. Lord, forgive me for doing
[51:20] that. And in God's eyes, well, he he
[51:23] can't even remember it anymore. It's
[51:25] gone. It's been washed off his books.
[51:27] It's completely gone. Amen. That's why
[51:30] it's so important you have faith that
[51:32] when you confess something sincerely
[51:34] into the blood of Jesus Christ, it's
[51:36] done. Amen. It's done. But where does it
[51:40] go? It goes off you onto him. Onto the
[51:43] one who caused it in the beginning.
[51:45] Amen. So, so now this is what the blood
[51:47] does. It transfers it all onto him.
[51:49] Amen. It's like brother Bram says about
[51:51] a, you know, the blood is like a the
[51:53] blood is like a drop of ink going into a
[51:56] tub of bleach. Breaks it down, you can't
[51:59] even find it no more. But who's got a
[52:01] answer for it? He says it goes on the
[52:02] head of the accuser who will carry it to
[52:05] the day of judgment. He'll then burn for
[52:06] it in the lake of fire.
[52:09] But in the first place, where were you?
[52:12] Shouting and rejoicing around the
[52:15] throne.
[52:17] Hallelujah. Let's just finish with with
[52:19] one more one more scripture, shall we?
[52:21] Let's go to Job uh chapter
[52:24] 19. Let's read
[52:30] this. He says this here. So, I'm going
[52:32] to go I know that Yeah, I'm sure we
[52:35] could all quote this, but but uh Job 19
[52:37] and 25, he says
[52:40] this. Let's all read this together,
[52:42] shall we?
[52:44] For I know that my redeemer liveth, and
[52:46] he shall stand at the latter day upon
[52:49] the earth. Let's go to the next verse,
[52:50] shall we? And though my skin worms
[52:52] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[52:54] I see God. We go to the next one. Whom I
[52:57] shall see for myself, mine eyes shall
[52:59] behold and not another. Though my reigns
[53:01] be consumed within me. Hallelujah. So
[53:04] dur dur during Job's great trial, he was
[53:07] looking to the end. Inspiration struck
[53:09] him, saying, I will stand one day. I
[53:11] know my redeemer liveth. Amen. Before
[53:14] this he said well man dies where does he
[53:16] go? He saw death burial resurrection in
[53:18] nature but a man he dies where does he
[53:20] go? But then the inspiration struck him
[53:21] saying in the latter days. Amen. My
[53:24] redeemer I'm going to stand with him.
[53:26] I'll see him with my own eyes. I'm going
[53:28] to see him. So so he could look forward
[53:30] but then God says look no I want to give
[53:32] you the whole picture Job. Where were
[53:34] you in the beginning? Hallelujah. Why?
[53:37] Because we can see our end. And the
[53:39] reason for our end is because of our
[53:41] beginning. Amen. So when you're going
[53:43] through a trial, you go through a hard
[53:45] time in life, you're going through
[53:47] something, you got to remember where was
[53:48] I before the foundation of the world.
[53:51] Amen. I was in God's mind. I was
[53:53] shouting and rejoicing. And you got to
[53:55] realize how God thought of me. This is
[53:57] my summary now. How God thought of me is
[54:00] how I'm going to end up. Right? And the
[54:03] reason that I can say I'm that is
[54:04] because now God has made me a
[54:06] worshshiper of him in spirit and in
[54:08] truth to begin to manifest that thought.
[54:12] Amen. Let's have the musicians please
[54:15] tonight. Amen. But where were you? I was
[54:18] with him. I know my redeemer liveth.
[54:21] Doesn't matter what happens on this
[54:22] earth. I will see him with my eyes. I
[54:25] will behold him and not another.
[54:30] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[54:33] You know what that word redeem
[54:35] means? It means never again exposed to
[54:40] sale. It's like a slave that's bought
[54:42] out of a market. But part of its
[54:44] meaning, so it's not just the purchase
[54:46] of it, but it also means that that that
[54:49] the person who's been bought will never
[54:50] be exposed to sale again. Amen. So if
[54:53] you're redeemed, you can never be sold.
[54:55] You can never be traded. You can never
[54:56] be lost. You can never fall into debt
[54:58] that you got to sell yourself into
[55:00] slavery no more. No. Never again I can
[55:02] be exposed to sale. Amen. I've been
[55:04] bought with the blood of Jesus Christ.
[55:06] Bought by a precious price. Amen. And I
[55:08] can never be lost.
[55:10] Amen. So I am redeemed by the blood of
[55:12] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Doesn't make
[55:19] Doesn't that make you happy? You see,
[55:20] I'm going through trouble, but I can
[55:22] never be sold. Amen. I I am bought. I
[55:26] I'm not my own. Whose am I? Am I the
[55:28] devil's? No, sir. I am I am the Lord
[55:31] Jesus Christ. I belong to him. Doesn't
[55:33] matter how I feel, what I'm going
[55:34] through. I'm his. Amen. I can never be
[55:37] sold. I can never be traded. He's not
[55:40] trading his wife for nothing. He's not
[55:42] trading you for nothing. Your precious
[55:43] jewel and his crown. Amen. He loves you
[55:45] with an unfailing love. Amen. Never
[55:48] forget that. Amen. He loves you more
[55:49] than you realize. Amen. His blood was
[55:52] poured out and full cuz he loves you.
[55:56] Amen. He wants you to realize you are
[55:58] with me. Before the foundation of the
[56:00] world, you came from me. You're going
[56:02] back to me. Amen. So, what should we do
[56:05] every day? Lord, I want to worship you
[56:06] in spirit and in truth. Lord, I want to
[56:08] manifest what how you thought of me
[56:11] before the beginning. I want to manifest
[56:12] that every day. Does that mean I shout
[56:15] and jump and run about? Maybe. But it
[56:17] should be a worship. Lord, come and
[56:18] live. May my life be a worship.
[56:20] Everything I do be a worship unto you,
[56:22] Lord. how I treat others, how I treat
[56:24] myself, how I treat my brother or
[56:26] sister, whoever it is. May it be a
[56:27] worship to you,
[56:29] Lord. Amen. Let's stand, shall we,
[56:35] tonight. Amen. I actually wrote down
[56:38] some
[56:38] songs. Amen. I was singing that song.
[56:40] There is a name written down in glory
[56:42] and it's mine. Yes, it's mine. Amen.
[56:46] It's not a new name written down in
[56:47] glory. That's not a correct thing. The
[56:49] name's already written. Amen. And God
[56:52] reveals your name's written there. I
[56:54] think we got I think we changed it,
[56:56] haven't we? Amen. Let's sing this. Um,
[57:01] Amen. I might just turn the service to
[57:03] you cuz I can't sing these things. Amen.
[57:05] Should we just let's just let's just
[57:08] pray. Hey, and then Josh just lead us in
[57:11] a praise, shall we? Amen. But okay, let
[57:13] you know, let's bow our heads. I just
[57:15] want to ask you a question. You
[57:16] say, you want Lord to make that you want
[57:19] the Lord to make that real to you? Amen.
[57:21] You ought to slip your hand up. Amen.
[57:24] Say, "Lord, I sincerely want to know
[57:27] that I was with you before the
[57:28] foundation of the world. Lord, may you
[57:30] put such a stability, such a rock of
[57:32] revelation in my heart that it doesn't
[57:34] matter what storms come, storms go,
[57:37] trouble comes, trouble goes, questions,
[57:39] whatever it may be, Lord, anxiety, what
[57:42] anything, Lord, whatever comes and goes,

[57:52] be lost because I'm part of you Lord
[57:54] Father I pray for everyone who's raised
[57:56] up their hands dear God I ask Father
[57:58] sincerely Lord for them dear God and
[58:00] myself as well Lord may anchor this down
[58:03] in our hearts Lord may we have heard
[58:05] these things many times but Lord I pray
[58:06] it'd be anchored down more solidified
[58:09] Lord Jesus that you sent this message to
[58:11] ask us a question where were you when I

[58:15] Lord Jesus you're giving the answer you
[58:16] are with me when I laid it you are
[58:18] shouting for joy and singing and
[58:20] praising. This is how I thought of you
[58:22] before the foundation of world and
[58:23] eternity. And how I thought of you is
[58:25] how you're going to end up when
[58:26] everything's said and done. Gracious
[58:28] Father, may you put this in our hearts,
[58:30] dear God, as we go, Father, into this
[58:32] week, Lord. May we just have such a joy,
[58:34] Lord, that Lord, of peace that passes
[58:36] all understanding because we belong to
[58:38] you, dear God. And Father, your blood is
[58:40] so great. You've redeemed us, Lord, in
[58:43] such completeness, Lord, that we can
[58:44] never be put on sail ever again, Father,
[58:46] because you bought us to keep us, Lord,
[58:48] to carry us away. We thank you, Father,
