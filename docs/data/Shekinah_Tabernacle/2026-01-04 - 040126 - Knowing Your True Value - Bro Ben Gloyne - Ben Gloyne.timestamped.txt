[5:31] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[5:33] Good to see you all this morning on this
[5:35] fine
[5:37] first Sunday of the new year.
[5:40] It's going to be a fantastic year this
[5:42] year. You looking forward to the year?
[5:44] Got some [music] big plans.
[5:47] Okay, this is this is what goes through.
[5:50] But we I was in the construction
[5:52] industry for a long time and we would
[5:54] have to price up jobs
[5:56] and we would go to building companies
[5:59] and get plans and sometimes I print them
[6:00] out on like was it A3 or A2? So
[6:02] sometimes they were massive like a roll
[6:04] like that and like this. And so every
[6:06] time we would walk into the office with
[6:08] these, we would always say, "Man, I've
[6:09] got big plans."
[6:13] But but yeah, but
[6:17] but the Lord's got big plans for you
[6:19] this year. He's walked into your office
[6:21] with some big plans.
[6:24] I took my moon boot off, too, if you
[6:26] noticed.
[6:28] A week early.
[6:30] It was
[6:32] I had a joke because I started off in a
[6:34] with a heel and it was like polyyrene
[6:35] and then every two weeks I could take a
[6:38] bit of the polyine out. So my I was sort
[6:41] of on high heels and I would go lower
[6:42] and lower and lower. So it was always my
[6:43] joke that I'm getting more and more
[6:45] sanctified as the sorry
[6:48] till I [laughter] ended up it was a
[6:50] joke. Okay.
[6:54] Knew I shouldn't have said that.
[6:56] But when [music] it was down on flats, I
[6:58] was actually walking on my heel the
[7:00] whole time and it was so painful because
[7:01] you can't actually the way the boots
[7:03] designed. So my ankle was getting worse
[7:05] walking on the boot. So I took it off.
[7:07] But I think I know my ankle's going to
[7:09] be my Achilles is going to be perfectly
[7:11] fine because when I was still in the
[7:13] cast, I was at the factory. I had to go
[7:15] there on a Friday night. I [music] could
[7:17] barely walk, but I had to go and help
[7:18] cuz they were really busy and a few
[7:19] people were down and I had to I was in
[7:20] the cast and I I went there only this
[7:23] one night where I could couldn't [music]
[7:24] really stand up for very long
[7:27] and I was just about to leave. I'd gone
[7:30] out and I just had to shoot back in and
[7:32] get something. And when I did, I walked
[7:34] through the back door of the factory and
[7:35] a guy was just walking past to go
[7:37] [music] um I think maybe use the
[7:38] restroom. And he is a guy I know. He's
[7:41] been in there two or three times. He he
[7:43] is a um pastor at a church in Otaki.
[7:46] [music] Um nice guy actually and he
[7:49] comes in every now and then. And
[7:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[7:51] &gt;&gt; um then he saw me with my ankle and he
[7:53] asked me what was wrong and I said it
[7:56] was my archilles and he told me a
[7:57] testimony of himself. He said he tore
[8:00] [music] his archilles and his whole
[8:02] ankle was mangled up and he couldn't
[8:04] move. He couldn't hardly walk for years.
[8:05] It was just it was all twisted [music]
[8:06] up. Um, but he always wanted to
[8:11] run again, but he never could. And a a
[8:13] guy invited him in Paradumu to go on
[8:15] this sort of military running training
[8:16] thing. And he said, "Look, I can't run
[8:17] at all. I can't do anything." [music]
[8:19] But something came over him and he said,
[8:20] "I'm just, you know what? I'm just going
[8:21] to move forward and believe in the
[8:22] Lord's going to miraculously heal my
[8:24] ankles." So, he said he just started
[8:26] trying to run and he was walking. Every
[8:27] every step he would take, he would say,
[8:29] "The Lord's healed me. The Lord's healed
[8:30] [music] me. The Lord's healed me. The
[8:32] Lord's my healer." And he would then he
[8:34] said one day the Lord just miraculously
[8:36] healed his Achilles [music] and he work
[8:38] walks perfectly. So then and as soon as
[8:40] he finished the testimony then he just
[8:43] prayed for me there and then that my
[8:45] Achilles will be totally healed [music]
[8:46] and I'll never have any issues. It
[8:48] wasn't miraculously healed because I've
[8:49] actually enjoyed the time off the couple
[8:51] of months off. But I know from there
[8:54] that was a divine appointment. The Lord
[8:55] just sent this guy in to pray and then
[8:57] left. So I'm like I'm not worried at all
[8:59] about this guy. I'm planning on running
[9:01] a marathon this year with Shannon later
[9:02] in the year. I'm going to do a 42k
[9:03] marathon on this ankle.
[9:06] Let's stand this morning.
[9:09] Let's commit the service to the Lord.
[9:12] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[9:14] your hand [snorts] upon each one of our
[9:16] lives, Lord, that we have such an
[9:18] exciting life when we serve you, Lord.
[9:20] There's always something new, as your
[9:22] word says. Your your your mercies are
[9:24] new every morning, Lord. There's always
[9:26] something fresh and new about you and
[9:27] about the what you're doing, Lord, and
[9:29] and your your plans, your purpose, Lord.
[9:31] You never sit around and you're never
[9:33] lazy. There's never just there's never a
[9:34] boring day with you, Lord. You you're
[9:37] always building up and making a new. We
[9:38] see the enemy, Lord, that his whole
[9:40] intention is just to tear down and
[9:42] destroy and and make things lifeless and
[9:44] boring, Lord, to to bring things down.
[9:46] But we thank you, Lord, that we can have
[9:47] such an exciting life with you, Lord,
[9:48] that you've always got great plans. And
[9:50] you said in your word, I know the plans
[9:52] that I have for you, Lord. Plans to give
[9:54] us an expected end, plans to bless us,
[9:56] plans to prosper us, Lord, and we want
[9:58] to surrender to your plans this year.
[9:59] May there not be anything in us that
[10:01] would [music] hinder your plan or little
[10:02] complexes we have, Lord, that would
[10:04] cause us to maybe [music] not not walk
[10:06] in the plan that you have, Lord. We want
[10:08] to we want to put those aside. May you
[10:10] through your spirit and through your
[10:11] word, Lord, break anything in our life
[10:12] that would hinder us this year from
[10:14] walking in complete victory from walking
[10:16] in what your perfect will is for us,
[10:18] Lord. And we just walk in the walk in in
[10:21] harmony with you. We pray. We just
[10:22] commit the service to your hands this
[10:23] morning. Just bless Brother Ben as he
[10:24] ministers. Thank you for a pastor, Lord.
[10:25] Thank you for an opportunity today to
[10:27] hear your word. We want to receive it as
[10:29] it's from you. So we just commit the
[10:30] service to your hands in Jesus wonderful
[10:31] name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's
[10:34] going to be a good service this morning.

[39:06] Amen. So, we're in for a great day, I
[39:08] believe. Amen. Praise the Lord. So,
[39:10] let's turn in the scripture, shall we?
[39:11] We're going to go to Matthew chapter 27
[39:14] and we're going to read uh verses uh 3-9
[39:18] here.
[39:20] Amen. I trust everyone's had a good 2026
[39:23] thus far.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; And we know every day is a good day if
[39:26] you're a Christian.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can rejoice and just put
[39:31] our feet under his table and just enjoy
[39:34] the goodness of God today. Amen. And so
[39:37] Matthew 27:es 3-9, it says, "Then Judas,
[39:40] which had betrayed him, when he saw that
[39:42] he was condemned, repented himself and
[39:44] brought again the 30 pieces of silver of
[39:47] the chief priests and elders, saying, I
[39:49] have sinned, and that I have betrayed
[39:51] innocent blood." And they said, "What is
[39:53] that to us? See thou to that?" And he
[39:56] cast down the pieces of silver in the
[39:58] temple, and departed, and went and
[39:59] hanged himself. And the chief priests
[40:02] took the silver pieces and said, "It is
[40:04] not lawful for to put them into the
[40:06] treasury because it is the price of
[40:08] blood." And they took counsel, and they
[40:10] brought uh with them the potter's field
[40:13] to buy uh to bury strangers in.
[40:16] Wherefore the field was called the field
[40:18] of blood unto this day. Then was
[40:20] fulfilled that which was spoken by
[40:22] Jeremy the prophet, saying, "And they
[40:24] took the 30 pieces of silver, the price
[40:26] of him that was valued, whom they, the
[40:29] children of Israel, did value."
[40:31] &gt;&gt; I want to speak about this morning
[40:33] knowing your true value.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; What are you worth?
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever's ruling your life is the
[40:39] value you've put on your life. Amen. So,
[40:41] let's bow heads in a word of prayer this
[40:43] morning. Amen. Just want to slip your
[40:44] hand up. Say, "Lord, remember me." And
[40:46] amen. Gracious Father, we're so
[40:48] thankful, Lord.
[40:50] You said you'd manifest yourself.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered in my
[40:54] name, there you are in the midst, Lord.
[40:56] Father, you're present, Lord Jesus. We
[40:57] gather in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:59] Christ this morning. I pray, Father, as
[41:01] we have read your word. May you bless it
[41:02] to our hearts, anoint speaker, and
[41:04] hearer, dear God. May we just surrender
[41:06] our lives, all that we are, into your
[41:08] hands. Just pray you cover us in your
[41:10] blood this day and be glorified in our
[41:11] midst. Lord, touch every life, both
[41:14] those here and those who are streaming.
[41:15] Lord, we commit all things into your
[41:16] hands. We love you, Lord. We thank you
[41:18] for this opportunity to gather together
[41:20] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[41:24] bless you, friends. You can have your
[41:25] seats this morning. So, I want to speak
[41:28] about this value. It's such a a small
[41:31] word, but such an important word. Such a
[41:33] such a uh such an important thing. Now,
[41:36] here we have this painting here is of
[41:38] Judas and there and he's bering back and
[41:40] forth between himself and the and the
[41:43] high priest and so on on the value of
[41:44] Jesus. Now this is the value that they
[41:47] that they would put on him was 30 pieces
[41:49] of silver and that 30 pieces of silver
[41:51] was the price of a slave. So that's the
[41:53] value they put on the prince of life.
[41:55] Now everything is valued in this world
[41:58] whether you like to think about it or
[42:00] not. Even your life has a value and uh
[42:02] it depends whose value you believe is
[42:05] really uh the value you put on yourself
[42:07] and in the way you conduct yourself as a
[42:08] person. Now a value this word value
[42:11] means to fix that is a valuation upon by
[42:14] implication to revere to honor to value.
[42:17] So this is what that meaning you know of
[42:19] the word value means now value is really
[42:22] based on uh what you think it is uh is
[42:26] it's you estimation or evaluation based
[42:28] on a person. Now I I I hope I don't go
[42:31] too quickly this morning because this is
[42:33] very important I believe as we go into
[42:35] 2026. Now, we know that uh Jacob and
[42:39] Esau, they put a different value on the
[42:41] birthright, right? Jacob was willing to
[42:43] do everything he could to get that
[42:45] birthright. Esau thought it was more
[42:47] important to eat than get the you know,
[42:49] he was he he sold his birthight for a
[42:52] massive pottage. And the scripture says,
[42:54] "And thus Esau despised his birthight."
[42:57] I find it very interesting that, you
[42:59] know, it wasn't only Jacob's tent there
[43:02] that, you know, there was a whole
[43:03] encampment of people. there would have
[43:05] been food elsewhere. You know, he he
[43:07] wouldn't have been the only one cooking.
[43:08] But he went there and he was so willing.
[43:10] He he devalued his birthright so greatly
[43:13] that he was willing just to get some
[43:14] food. He had gone hunting. Maybe he was
[43:17] bringing back some venison and he could
[43:18] have cooked something, right? But he
[43:20] devalued it so much and he despised it.
[43:23] But Jacob valued it very highly. See, it
[43:26] depends on what you're how you're
[43:28] looking at something is the value you'll
[43:30] place upon it and especially even your
[43:32] own life. Now Moses, Moses and Pharaoh
[43:35] were looking at the children of Israel
[43:37] and they saw two very different values
[43:39] in them. They were looking at the same
[43:41] people in the same conditions doing the
[43:43] same things. But yet when Moses would uh
[43:46] you know when Pharaoh, let's just read
[43:47] this. And as Moses as a young man looked
[43:50] through the palace window at the slaves,
[43:52] he saw the same bunch of grimy, dirty,
[43:54] muckridden slaves that that that Pharaoh
[43:56] saw. And when Pharaoh looked upon them
[43:58] and the Egyptians, they wasn't nothing
[44:00] but a bunch of slaves. That's all they
[44:03] were good for. Just to be human mudbers
[44:06] and to make muddy bricks for the benefit
[44:08] of the cities that Pharaoh was building.
[44:10] That's the way Egyptians and Pharaoh
[44:12] looked at the slaves. So they saw a
[44:14] commodity. They saw less than human
[44:16] beings. Even, you know, Pharaoh would
[44:18] have taken better care of his horses
[44:20] than he would the children of Israel if
[44:22] they died. Well, who cares? Just replace
[44:24] another one. He didn't care about them.
[44:26] None. They were just a tool in his hand
[44:28] to build what he wanted to build. But
[44:30] Moses went so so that was the value
[44:32] Pharaoh put upon the people of God. But
[44:34] when Moses looked uh at the same people
[44:37] out the same window, he looked at
[44:39] something very different. Amen. You see,
[44:41] when he seen passing by the window, the
[44:43] great ditches in their faces, the tears
[44:45] running down their cheeks and their bent
[44:46] bodies. He looked upon them as the
[44:48] people of God. He didn't look upon them
[44:50] as slaves. He looked upon them as the
[44:52] chosen people of God. So the value that
[44:55] he placed on God's people was the value
[44:57] that God placed on his people. Cuz the
[44:59] scripture says that out of Egypt I've
[45:01] called my son. God never said out of
[45:03] Egypt I've called a bunch of slaves to
[45:05] become my children. No, they were my
[45:07] son. They are my son. Therefore I am
[45:09] calling them out. They were God's value
[45:12] upon the people of Israel with these are
[45:14] my chosen ones. I mean they're not just
[45:16] any people. They're my elected ones
[45:18] through their lineage is going to become
[45:20] me to the earth. Amen. They are the
[45:22] people I have chosen to fulfill
[45:24] prophecy. That's the value that he
[45:27] placed upon them. That they were there
[45:28] to fulfill God's word. And friends, if
[45:31] you could put the same value upon your
[45:33] life. I mean, you're not just here to to
[45:35] just be a mass of people or a number or,
[45:37] you know, something that's not even
[45:39] important. You're very important to God.
[45:41] That's really what I want to get to.
[45:42] What do you what value have you allowed
[45:44] to be placed upon your life?
[45:48] Amen. What rules you dictates the value
[45:50] you've allowed to be placed on your
[45:52] life. Okay? So Moses saw a people of
[45:55] great value. He saw a fulfillment of
[45:57] God's word, but Pharaoh just saw slaves.
[46:01] So it's all about the value. Now,
[46:02] Brother Bram tells a story. I'm just
[46:04] going to go through some examples of
[46:05] people who didn't see the value in
[46:07] things quickly before we just kind of
[46:09] transition a bit. But you see, Brother
[46:10] Bram tells a story of a little boy in
[46:12] Kentucky long ago. He said that he was
[46:14] went up in the attic and he was looking
[46:16] through all the stuff that they had in
[46:17] the house and you know he found a little
[46:19] old po postage stamp and so this boy his
[46:22] on his mind was ice cream. He was like
[46:24] Esau. He just wanted a he just wanted a
[46:26] quick sugar rush or something you know
[46:28] just to get him by. He was thinking
[46:29] through little boy a boy mentality. He
[46:32] wanted ice cream. Who likes ice cream?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Some boys never grow up. But you see we
[46:37] all I mean most of us like ice cream,
[46:39] right? But that was on his mind. And so
[46:41] all he thought of was was ice cream. And
[46:43] how can he get ice cream? He found a
[46:44] stamp. Maybe he heard that you could
[46:46] trade stamps and so on. So, you know,
[46:48] you know, he found this little stamp. He
[46:49] ran down to the stamp collector and you
[46:51] know, he was just probably just wanting
[46:53] to get literally the price of one ice
[46:55] cream. But when the stamp collector saw
[46:57] it, he saw a greater value than the boy
[46:59] did. And so he sold it for a dollar. And
[47:02] that boy would have thought, man, I've
[47:03] really struck it big. How many ice
[47:04] creams could I get? You know, in those
[47:06] days with a dollar, you could get quite
[47:08] a few. And you know, so he ran off
[47:10] feeling very satisfied. But you see, he
[47:12] didn't know the right value of that
[47:14] stamp. And I think really if his parents
[47:17] knew the value of that stamp and they
[47:19] took it out of the attic and they put it
[47:20] on the mantle piece and then and then
[47:22] because that pl because that stamp would
[47:24] have been placed in the eyes of this
[47:26] child as a prominent piece of furniture,
[47:29] he would know to ask, "Mommy, daddy, why
[47:31] is that little bit of paper up there on
[47:32] the mantle piece in that frame?" And
[47:33] they would explain, "Well, it's because
[47:35] it has great value." Amen. It's a
[47:37] priceless thing and every day it's its
[47:39] value is actually going up because it
[47:41] gets rarer and rarer all the time. And
[47:44] if he knew the true value of it, amen,
[47:46] he would never have sold it for a
[47:47] dollar. And I think it's the same thing
[47:49] with the word of God. If we teach the
[47:51] value of the word to our children, to
[47:53] our families, we keep it as a thing that
[47:56] the word of God is priceless. Amen. It
[47:58] is the greatest treasure that can ever
[48:00] come into your life is the word of God.
[48:02] You'll hold it with great value and you
[48:04] won't trade it for nothing. And you
[48:06] won't trade yourself for nothing either
[48:08] if you know the value of the word of God
[48:10] because you're part of that word. So
[48:11] what happened was that stamp collector
[48:13] sold it and then and then then another
[48:15] guy sold it and then he said it's uh
[48:17] it's worth a quarter of a million
[48:19] dollars and the value would have gone up
[48:21] astronomically
[48:23] uh from then to now. You see it's a it's
[48:26] value. Now as I said the word value in
[48:29] the Bible is actually the same as the
[48:30] word honor. And here's a couple of uh uh
[48:34] times in the scripture where this word
[48:35] value is swapped for the word honor
[48:37] where in first Timothy it says honor
[48:39] widows that are widows indeed. Or
[48:41] actually you can just swap say value
[48:43] widows. It's exactly the same word value
[48:46] widows that are widows indeed. And Jesus
[48:48] would say for the father judgeth no man
[48:51] but hath committed all judgment unto the
[48:53] son that all men should honor the son or
[48:56] value the son even as they honor the
[48:59] father or value the father. He that
[49:01] honorth not the son honorth not the
[49:04] father which hath sent him. So he that
[49:06] doesn't value the father. He that
[49:08] doesn't value God does not value the son
[49:12] places no value upon him. But they that
[49:15] value the son they value the father. See
[49:18] if you value the word it's showing that
[49:20] you value god. Amen. If you value the
[49:23] word the word is something even I think
[49:25] job said that his word is more important
[49:27] than his next meal or food. Amen. That's
[49:30] the value Job put upon the word of God.
[49:32] And I think I know I believe I'm looking
[49:34] at people that have placed the same
[49:35] value upon the word that he'd rather go
[49:38] without a meal than it would be the word
[49:39] of God. That's how important it is to
[49:41] you. And the church said, "Amen."
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Right? So there's got to be a value that
[49:47] we've placed. But the thing is the see
[49:49] see Jesus knew I'm just going to jump to
[49:51] this quickly. See Jesus knew the value
[49:53] of the word. when he would tell the
[49:56] story of a certain man, he'd speak about
[49:58] the, you know, the rich man in Lazarus.
[50:00] He told the story of a certain man. He's
[50:02] speaking of that. And then now I've just
[50:04] put into the story here where this rich
[50:06] man finds himself in hell and he's
[50:08] looking, you know, across the chasm. He
[50:10] sees, you know, that poor man Lazarus in
[50:12] the bosom of Abraham. And you know the
[50:14] rich man is calling for you know you
[50:16] know for Abraham to send Lazarus with a
[50:18] bit bit of finger upon his finger to to
[50:21] go on his tongue to to quench you know
[50:23] to you know give him a bit of comfort in
[50:25] the flames. And then he but but then
[50:27] Abraham explains that there's a gulf
[50:29] between you and I. We can't come to you
[50:31] and you can't come to us. And and then
[50:33] and then and then the uh rich man says
[50:36] send Lazarus from the grave and go talk
[50:38] to my family. Because you know this rich
[50:40] man, he didn't realize the value of what
[50:43] they already had. He thought the value
[50:44] of a resurrection would save his his
[50:47] family, would convince them that God is
[50:49] true. But you see, Abraham would say,
[50:51] "No, if they don't hear Moses and the
[50:53] prophets, they'll neither be persuaded
[50:55] though one rise from the dead." See,
[50:57] it's the value of the word. See, Jesus
[51:00] was saying in this parable that the
[51:01] words they already had had so much
[51:04] value, it would stop them being lost.
[51:06] Amen. It would send them to heaven.
[51:08] That's the value the Lord put upon the
[51:10] word of God. And he put a value far
[51:12] greater in the word than he did the
[51:14] supernatural. I mean because brother
[51:16] Bram said it's receiving the word is the
[51:18] thing that has the value. And if you
[51:20] really get the word then the
[51:22] supernatural will follow the receiving
[51:23] of the word. I mean because the word is
[51:26] Jesus Christ. So you see because the
[51:28] thing is if if if if it was the
[51:31] supernatural that that would save
[51:33] somebody or convert somebody then Jesus
[51:36] would say yes I'll send you I will
[51:37] resurrect you and send you back but he
[51:39] said no the value that converts a person
[51:41] is actually the word it's not the
[51:43] supernatural otherwise when Moses took
[51:46] Israel out of Egypt they would have all
[51:47] been believers they they wouldn't have
[51:50] been in the desert for 40 years all 12
[51:52] spies would have given the same report
[51:54] the same as Caleb and Joshua but you see
[51:56] they did not see the value of the
[51:58] promise of the word saying you're going
[51:59] to come out of Egypt and you're going
[52:01] into the promised land. Caleb and Joshua
[52:03] saw the value of it because they realize
[52:05] that their value is they are sons and
[52:07] daughters of God. Amen. But you see now
[52:10] what happens is people will always uh
[52:12] well sadly they will have the wrong
[52:14] value upon their lives and that value is
[52:17] actually given by the enemy and not by
[52:19] God.
[52:21] It says in Proverbs 11:1, "A false
[52:24] balance is an abomination to the Lord,
[52:26] but a just weight is his delight." So, a
[52:29] false balance gives a wrong value of
[52:31] what's being weighed. You see this
[52:33] picture, there's a there's a feather
[52:35] outweighing a stone. Well, that's a
[52:36] that's a false balance. Amen. But you
[52:39] see, this is what happens is see a false
[52:41] see false as in deceiving or fraudulent
[52:43] and a false balance brings a false or
[52:46] gives a false value. So now this is see
[52:50] this is what see God wants you to know
[52:52] your true value and Satan wants you to
[52:54] believe what he values you to be worth
[52:57] and his his his scales his balance is
[53:01] false. Amen. He he does not think you're
[53:04] really any value. The same attitude
[53:06] Pharaoh had towards the children of
[53:07] Israel in Egypt is the same attitude
[53:09] that Satan has towards Adam's fallen
[53:12] race, towards humanity. He has no value
[53:14] in them. just wants to use them, contain
[53:16] them, keep them in prison because he
[53:18] knows God can't lose a part of himself.
[53:20] He's going to fight with all he can to
[53:23] devalue humanity to itself. Amen. That
[53:26] that they will live below their
[53:28] privileges. And and we got to we got to
[53:30] recognize that Satan's done a marvelous
[53:32] job in devaluing humanity to itself.
[53:37] Done a marvelous job. People will
[53:39] devalue themselves to follow some movie
[53:41] star, someone on Tik Tok, some lust
[53:43] spirit, some adulterous spirit, some
[53:45] pride, some jealousy, some and and and
[53:48] and we'll come to that. But but that's
[53:49] the value that the devil's put upon
[53:52] someone and they believe that value.
[53:54] Friends, we're worth more than 10,000
[53:56] worlds. Amen. We'll come to that later.
[53:58] But you see, it's such a it's such a
[54:00] false it's such a false balance. You
[54:02] know, there's a there's a false See, a
[54:04] false balance never shows your true
[54:07] value.
[54:08] Amen. It's like the attitude and and and
[54:10] there's a truth to the statement, but we
[54:13] must be very careful in and and in in
[54:15] how we how we look at it where where you
[54:18] know, brother Bram says the statement
[54:19] and then I agree with it that I'm a
[54:21] sinner saved by grace. Now this there is
[54:24] a fine line in the statement between
[54:26] truth and false humility because a
[54:28] person that says well I'm just a sinner
[54:31] saved by grace with the wrong attitude
[54:34] with a false humility makes themselves a
[54:36] secondass servant in the in the kingdom
[54:39] of God. It gives them actually a slave
[54:42] mentality and it actually many times
[54:44] gives them an excuse to remain a drunk,
[54:46] a gambler, a womanizer, a whoreonger,
[54:49] whatever it is, living all kind of lives
[54:51] is because they say, "Well, I'm just a
[54:52] sinner saved by grace."
[54:55] Right? That's a wrong value upon a
[54:58] person. We all were sinners.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; We all were lost. Amen. But friends, we
[55:03] are more than just sinners saved by
[55:05] grace. True, we were all born in sin. We
[55:08] were all born sinners. But the grace of
[55:10] God saved us from sin. It cleans us up.
[55:14] It washes us. It transforms us. And it
[55:17] shows us our true value. Amen. Because
[55:19] we're actually a child of God saved from
[55:23] sin by God's grace. Friends, we are we
[55:26] are we are more than just a number. See
[55:28] a wrong value as well. I'm just a sinner
[55:31] save. You know, I'm just a sinner. I'm
[55:32] just trying to get through life and you
[55:34] know, God's grace kind of winks at my
[55:36] sin and just kind of turns a blind eye.
[55:38] That's a false humility. There is
[55:40] transforming power in the word of God to
[55:42] deliver a person from anything. There is
[55:45] nothing that God can't deliver from.
[55:47] Save us, keep us, redeem us, wash us up.
[55:50] There is nothing that we cannot be saved
[55:52] or set free from. Amen. But you see see
[55:55] but the you see what happens is the
[55:58] value that Satan puts upon us is a wrong
[56:00] one. Saying we're nothing. We're just a
[56:02] number. I'm just one of 8 billion people
[56:04] upon the earth.
[56:06] That's the value that Satan wants to put
[56:09] upon you. You know, I remember working
[56:10] with a guy at a sure quality. Uh he was
[56:13] just a temp guy, but he decided that
[56:15] he's not going to be married. He's not
[56:16] going to have children because he's just
[56:18] a bunch of DNA running around on two
[56:20] legs. That's the value he let Satan put
[56:23] down his throat. That he wasn't he
[56:25] wasn't anything special.
[56:27] We are more than just a bunch of DNA
[56:29] walking around. I mean, we're more than
[56:31] just, you know, we're more than just a
[56:33] number in New Zealand. We are the apple
[56:36] of God's eye. We have You have great
[56:38] value in God's mind. Amen. Where he'd
[56:41] say in Psalms 116:15, "Precious in the
[56:44] sight of the Lord is the death of his
[56:46] saints." Amen. He cares when one falls
[56:48] to the ground. He cares when one dies
[56:50] and he cares about the people they leave
[56:52] behind. Amen. Because we are important
[56:54] to God. Jesus would say that uh are not
[56:58] uh are not two sparrows sold for a
[57:00] farthing and one of them shall not fall
[57:02] to the ground without your father
[57:04] knowing about it and even the hairs of
[57:06] your head are numbered. Who's ever tried
[57:08] to count your hair? I haven't. Okay, I
[57:11] know when to quit. I didn't even start.
[57:13] But you see there's [clears throat] we
[57:14] have multiple hair. You know, he knows
[57:16] every one of us. He knows every single
[57:18] part of us. Amen. We are not just a
[57:20] number in a group. We're not just a
[57:22] number upon this planet. We have great
[57:24] value in the sight of God. Amen. Our
[57:27] value is far above just being a church
[57:30] member. That's a that's a false balance.
[57:32] If you think, well, I'm just part of a
[57:33] group. You're never meant to be part of
[57:35] a group. I mean, you're never meant to
[57:36] be part of Shikina Tabernacle and just
[57:38] be a church member. No. God never
[57:40] intended you just to be that. Amen.
[57:42] You're living below your privilege. If
[57:44] you do not know God and the power of his
[57:45] resurrection, you're living far below
[57:47] your privilege. Amen. God God's value to
[57:50] you is far more than that. Amen. But he
[57:53] what what is his value upon you? Amen.
[57:57] Is because what does he want to do? He
[57:59] wants to live inside you. Amen. That his
[58:01] word which is God himself would step in
[58:03] and transform your life. Amen. Because
[58:05] he saw something of great value upon you
[58:08] that even nothing can buy it upon this
[58:10] earth. That's how valuable you are.
[58:13] Amen. It's like the word of God. Never
[58:14] let it be devalued to just a bunch of
[58:17] argument.
[58:19] Amen. or just a nice moral code or a
[58:21] bunch of ethics to live by that makes a
[58:23] better group of people. I say that is
[58:25] greatly devaluing the word of God. I
[58:28] mean because the word of God transforms
[58:30] lives. Amen. As Jesus Christ revealed
[58:33] God of heaven being made known. Amen.
[58:35] Makes us into sons and daughters of God
[58:37] transforming power. Amen. The word of
[58:39] God will rapture us. Amen. It keeps us,
[58:41] saves us, watches over us. Amen. Guides
[58:44] us. Amen. This see there is far greater
[58:46] value in the word than I think even we
[58:48] really realize.
[58:50] The message was not sent to make
[58:52] arguments. The message was sent to
[58:54] identify sons and daughters of God to
[58:57] reveal your value to you.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[59:06] because even the name of Jesus as as as
[59:08] the angel would say to Mary in Matthew
[59:10] chapter 1, he says, "And you shall call
[59:12] his name Jesus, for he he shall save his
[59:15] people from his from their sins." That's
[59:18] the whole purpose that he came to the
[59:20] earth that he would save his people. Not
[59:22] just not just a number, but people that
[59:24] he had on his mind in the back part of
[59:26] his mind before the foundation of the
[59:27] world. He thought of you and he's
[59:29] expressed upon the earth to save you
[59:31] from your sins. Amen. See, see, see,
[59:35] that's why I say we're more than just
[59:36] sinners saved by grace. We are God's
[59:39] people saved from sin by the grace of
[59:42] God. Amen. See, that takes us from a
[59:45] servant mentality into a sunship. We got
[59:47] to realize we got great value. I trust
[59:49] everyone's with me this morning. Amen.
[59:51] And yeah, even even it would say in
[59:53] Galatians that because you are sons, God
[59:56] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[59:57] your hearts crying, "Aba, Father."
[59:59] Wherefore, you're no more a servant, but
[1:00:01] a son. You're not a secondass citizen.
[1:00:03] This is the value God has placed upon
[1:00:05] your life. You're part of his family.
[1:00:07] And because you are his family, he sends
[1:00:09] forth his holy ghost. Amen. You don't
[1:00:12] become You don't become a son by the new
[1:00:14] birth. You're born again because you are
[1:00:17] a son or daughter of God. That's the
[1:00:19] value he placed upon you. You're part of
[1:00:21] God. I mean, you say and and then even
[1:00:24] Jesus would say, "All that the father
[1:00:25] has given me shall come to me." I mean,
[1:00:29] he has a collection of people on his
[1:00:31] mind. And and him that cometh to me,
[1:00:33] I'll no wise cast out. So, his his value
[1:00:36] on humanity is he's not willing that any
[1:00:38] would perish, but all would come to
[1:00:40] repentance. He cares about everybody.
[1:00:43] He's not indifferent towards humanity.
[1:00:44] He cares very much because he has great
[1:00:47] value upon human beings. Amen.
[1:00:50] Praise the Lord. I'm glad about that.
[1:00:52] Aren't you?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even like brother would
[1:00:56] preach the sermon. This probably a
[1:00:57] segue, but you know you know I'm sure
[1:00:59] we've all heard the service uh is your
[1:01:01] life worthy of the gospel? Who's heard
[1:01:04] that message? Now it's interesting in
[1:01:07] that message because many people take
[1:01:09] that take that title and they think now
[1:01:11] I have to earn something to have value
[1:01:13] in the sight of God that now my life has
[1:01:15] value that I become worthy of the
[1:01:17] gospel. Right? Isn't that what people
[1:01:19] think? What do I need to do to to become
[1:01:22] worthy or what do I need to to do to add
[1:01:24] value to my life that my life becomes
[1:01:27] worthy of the gospel? Brother never
[1:01:29] teaches it that way. That is that is not
[1:01:31] what he teaches. He goes to the he goes
[1:01:34] to the parable of the man who makes a
[1:01:36] wedding feast and invites the guests and
[1:01:38] sends out and three times and the third
[1:01:40] time, you know, he says, "Go get the
[1:01:42] Hulk blind and go to the highways and
[1:01:44] byways." And then brother Bram takes
[1:01:46] that scripture and then he says he he
[1:01:49] says that there's been an invitation to
[1:01:51] the Pentecostal feast of the word of
[1:01:53] God. Amen. There's an invitation come
[1:01:55] out. Come and dine at the master's
[1:01:57] table. Come and become one with him.
[1:01:59] Come become one with his word. But he
[1:02:01] says this world has turned down the
[1:02:03] invitation. So then therefore what makes
[1:02:06] your life worthy of the gospel is you
[1:02:08] receive his invitation.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. that because he saw value in you
[1:02:13] that you would receive the invitation.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not it's not something
[1:02:18] that you obtain to by your own human
[1:02:20] effort. No, it's not that at all. No,
[1:02:22] it's by it's by God you allowing God to
[1:02:25] come into every facet of your life, your
[1:02:28] private life, your pride, your job, your
[1:02:30] home life, your thought life, every part
[1:02:33] of your life. You let God come in and
[1:02:34] rearrange what he wants to rearrange.
[1:02:36] Amen. that you that you allow this
[1:02:39] Pentecostal feast of the word, Amen, to
[1:02:41] transform your life. Amen. That's what
[1:02:44] makes your life worthy of the gospel.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's not something
[1:02:49] you has everyone got that clear, right?
[1:02:52] See, it's not something you humanly
[1:02:54] obtain to. It's like you No, you just
[1:02:56] receive his word and you let him change
[1:02:58] you. What are you doing? Accepting the
[1:03:00] invitation.
[1:03:02] Amen. as as he would say, but as many as
[1:03:04] received him, to him gave he power to
[1:03:06] become the sons of God, even to them
[1:03:08] that believe on his name. What do you
[1:03:10] you receive the invitation to the
[1:03:12] Pentecostal feast and the word
[1:03:14] transforms you into a son of God. Amen.
[1:03:17] Which are born not of blood, nor of the
[1:03:19] will of the flesh, but of the nor of the
[1:03:20] will of man, but of God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the outward sign. So So what is
[1:03:25] the outward sign of receiving the word?
[1:03:28] Amen. Well, it's very simple. It's like
[1:03:30] in the beginning as many as re received
[1:03:34] his word were baptized in the name of
[1:03:35] Jesus Christ. I mean because what's
[1:03:37] happening is you're taking on a
[1:03:39] different name. You're changing your
[1:03:41] name from sinner or lost to Mrs. Jesus
[1:03:44] Christ. You're choosing a side. That's
[1:03:46] why well how do you become a Christian?
[1:03:48] You repent. Change your thinking. Change
[1:03:50] your mind. Amen. Say Lord I'm going to
[1:03:52] follow you. Well then then how do you
[1:03:54] express that to the world? You are
[1:03:55] baptized, buried in his name in water in
[1:03:58] the name of Jesus Christ to come forth
[1:03:59] in newness of life. So as many as
[1:04:01] received his word were baptized. It's
[1:04:03] that simple. Praise the Lord. I'm glad
[1:04:06] about that. Aren't you? You're taking
[1:04:07] his name. Now, this is very important
[1:04:09] because there's been a battle for the
[1:04:11] human soul that the value that God has
[1:04:14] um met both both God and Satan has put
[1:04:17] on the human soul. Now, I just want to
[1:04:21] um you know, this is now you can't see
[1:04:24] it. It's kind of dark in the back, but
[1:04:25] you know, I Googled what's the most
[1:04:27] valuable piece of real estate in the
[1:04:28] world. And and Mr. Google said
[1:04:32] Buckingham Palace has the greatest
[1:04:34] value. It's valued, this is in 2022.
[1:04:39] And so it's valued to be worth 1.3
[1:04:41] billion pounds or 2.6 million New
[1:04:45] Zealand dollars. And some uh valuations
[1:04:48] place it higher to nearly 5 million US,
[1:04:51] 8.2 New Zealand billion.
[1:04:54] That's a lot of money. Now, not everyone
[1:04:57] can live in this house. You can't go buy
[1:04:59] that. Even if you had the money, you
[1:05:00] can't buy it. Now, only only certain
[1:05:03] people can live in this live in this
[1:05:04] place. That's how valuable it is. And
[1:05:07] its value is not just based on what it's
[1:05:09] built out of out of the gold that's in
[1:05:10] it. But it's but but its value is based
[1:05:13] on its cultural and historical
[1:05:15] significance to the to to Great Britain
[1:05:18] because it's the palace of the king or
[1:05:20] the queen of England. And so I when I
[1:05:23] saw this I thought isn't that
[1:05:24] interesting? A palace is the most
[1:05:25] valuable piece of real estate in the
[1:05:28] world. This is what man has put on a
[1:05:30] natural palace. I tell you what friends,
[1:05:32] what about the value that God has put on
[1:05:34] the human soul. Amen. To live there.
[1:05:37] Amen. Not everyone can live here.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not everyone can live here. And
[1:05:41] the bride of Jesus Christ has incredible
[1:05:44] significance to heaven. Not just a
[1:05:46] cultural and historical impact or
[1:05:48] whatever it is. No. In the word of God,
[1:05:50] the bride of Jesus Christ is the most
[1:05:52] important thing and and thing is not the
[1:05:55] right word, but group. Amen. In
[1:05:57] existence, that's the value that God has
[1:06:00] placed upon you. Amen. You can't even
[1:06:02] put a human number on how much you're
[1:06:05] worth.
[1:06:07] Because the Lord Jesus, well, God would
[1:06:09] say in Isaiah 66, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:06:11] heaven is my throne, earth is my
[1:06:13] foottool. Where is the house that ye
[1:06:16] build unto me, and where is the place of
[1:06:17] my rest?" So I made the galaxies, I made
[1:06:20] the nebulas and all the universe and all
[1:06:22] these things, but where can I rest
[1:06:24] myself? Where can I sit down and feel
[1:06:26] refreshed and let the pressure off? He's
[1:06:27] asking the question. Amen. And for all
[1:06:29] those that have made uh have mine
[1:06:32] handmade and all those things have been,
[1:06:34] sayeth the Lord, but to this man will I
[1:06:36] look. This is the place of his rest he's
[1:06:38] looking for. Even to him that is poor of
[1:06:40] a contrite spirit and trembleth at my
[1:06:43] word.
[1:06:44] Now, real estate value is really based
[1:06:47] upon location and also how many people
[1:06:50] want to live there. That's why you take
[1:06:52] a three-bedroom house on Oriental Parade
[1:06:55] and you take a three-bedroom house in
[1:06:57] Hokata. They got different value,
[1:07:00] right? You may think, I'd rather live in
[1:07:02] Hokatika, but a lot of people would
[1:07:03] rather live in Oriental Parade. That's
[1:07:05] why you add another zero or two behind
[1:07:07] the Oriental Pride House than you would
[1:07:09] in Hogata cuz it has higher value based
[1:07:12] on people's evaluation of it. Now, God's
[1:07:15] evaluation of the human soul of the
[1:07:17] bride of Jesus Christ is is extremely
[1:07:20] high.
[1:07:22] You can't even put a figure on that's
[1:07:24] how high he values you. And this is
[1:07:26] where he desires to dwell. Amen. This is
[1:07:29] the place of his rest as you'd say in
[1:07:31] Psalms. A a song and psalm for the sons
[1:07:34] of Kora. Great is the Lord and greatly
[1:07:36] to be praised in the city of our God. In
[1:07:38] the mountain of his holiness, beautiful
[1:07:40] for situation. The joy of the whole
[1:07:42] earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the
[1:07:45] north, the city of the great king. God
[1:07:47] is known in her palaces for a refuge.
[1:07:49] Now, Zion does not just speak of Zion
[1:07:51] and Jerusalem, but it speaks of the
[1:07:52] bride of Jesus Christ. And notice it's
[1:07:55] in the sides of the north. This is where
[1:07:56] God wants to dwell.
[1:07:58] And so, because God wants it, so does
[1:08:00] Satan.
[1:08:02] He says, "I will also sit upon the mount
[1:08:04] of the congregation in the sides of the
[1:08:05] north. I'll be like the most high." So,
[1:08:08] both Satan and God have placed a very
[1:08:10] high value on humanity because Satan
[1:08:13] knows if he can just get and dwell where
[1:08:15] God wants to dwell and stops God
[1:08:17] dwelling there, he's going to win
[1:08:19] amongst the elect ones. But I tell you
[1:08:22] what, Satan can't. He tries, but he
[1:08:24] can't do it. But that's why he tries to
[1:08:26] put all of the world under a blanket of
[1:08:28] darkness to say, "These are my property.
[1:08:31] This is this is mine. But God, we
[1:08:33] understand by election won't won't let
[1:08:35] one of his stay stay with Satan on the
[1:08:37] throne. No, he's going to evict that
[1:08:38] guy. Amen. Out of every man, woman, boy,
[1:08:41] and girl that belong to God. And God's
[1:08:43] going to dwell there cuz that's where
[1:08:45] God has purposed. I'm going to live
[1:08:46] there. That's the value that I have that
[1:08:49] that that he has placed upon the bride
[1:08:51] of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:54] See, there has to come a time when we
[1:08:57] know our value,
[1:08:59] right? Even as say in 1 Corinthians 13,
[1:09:02] for now we see through a glass darkly,
[1:09:04] but then face to face now for I know in
[1:09:06] part, but then shall I know even also uh
[1:09:09] as also I am known. So there has to come
[1:09:12] a time when we know our value where
[1:09:14] we're not guessing that we are worth a
[1:09:16] certain amount or something, but we know
[1:09:18] our value in the sight of God. Cuz if
[1:09:21] you know you're worth it, man, you're
[1:09:22] not going to sell yourself for something
[1:09:24] less. You say, "No, no, I'm worth far
[1:09:26] more than this thing the devil's trying
[1:09:27] to give me." Isn't that right? You're
[1:09:29] going to you're going to actually esteem
[1:09:30] yourself. And this is not pride. You
[1:09:32] don't realize, no, I was bought with a
[1:09:33] price. It wasn't a cheap price. I wasn't
[1:09:36] in the $2 shop. I wasn't a hamburger
[1:09:38] from McDonald's. I mean, no, no, I'm a
[1:09:40] very valuable person.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So, see, this is
[1:09:45] this is very important that you realize
[1:09:47] because if you realize your value, why
[1:09:49] would you let something far less rule
[1:09:51] your life? Why would you let some spirit
[1:09:53] out of hell govern your life and dictate
[1:09:55] what you should do and be the king of
[1:09:57] your life? Why would you devalue
[1:09:59] yourself that low when God placed such a
[1:10:02] high price amen upon upon you? Now,
[1:10:06] there's a saying that people say, I've
[1:10:10] been thinking about this, you know, keep
[1:10:12] your eyes on Calvary and move forward.
[1:10:15] What does that mean?
[1:10:18] I'm not asking for an answer, but you I
[1:10:20] just want you to think about it. Have
[1:10:20] you actually thought about, oh, we're
[1:10:21] just we're just keeping Calvary in front
[1:10:23] of us and we're just looking at Calvary
[1:10:25] and look to Calvary. What does that
[1:10:28] mean? Does that mean that all other
[1:10:30] revelation uh is not important? Does
[1:10:33] that mean we throw out all the books of
[1:10:34] Paul and we just keep the gospels and we
[1:10:37] just keep the part where Jesus was died
[1:10:39] on Calvary? It doesn't mean that. And it
[1:10:42] what it means is it means that you've
[1:10:44] got to see what Jesus did for you and
[1:10:48] your value of what he did for you. I'm
[1:10:50] going to break that down a bit. But you
[1:10:52] see, because what happens is when you
[1:10:53] really see Calvary for what it is, then
[1:10:56] it will change your life forever because
[1:10:58] you'll see your value. You'll see what
[1:11:00] he did.
[1:11:02] You'll see what he did and you'll see
[1:11:04] what it means to you. And not just that,
[1:11:07] but it will it will show you your value
[1:11:10] because we know that day on Calvary, the
[1:11:12] Lord Jesus purchased the redemption of
[1:11:14] the whole world. He purchased our
[1:11:16] salvation in full. It's paid in full.
[1:11:19] Amen. All of our sins have been struck
[1:11:21] off. Our iniquities, our secret faults,
[1:11:24] everything was paid for that day in
[1:11:26] completeness. Amen. Our healing was paid
[1:11:29] for. It's all paid for. You know, have
[1:11:31] you ever imagine if you go to a
[1:11:32] restaurant, you say, "It's on the house.
[1:11:34] It's paid for."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; You kind of eat differently to when
[1:11:36] you've got to pay for it, especially if
[1:11:38] you're a bit tight. You see, you know,
[1:11:41] but if you realize it's paid for, man,
[1:11:42] you just relax. You just go enjoy. It's
[1:11:44] paid for. Why? And you you know and if
[1:11:46] you just get a little entree and you're
[1:11:49] sitting in the corner having this little
[1:11:50] thing and someone comes and looks at you
[1:11:52] and they say, "What are you doing? This
[1:11:54] is paid for, man. Why are you just
[1:11:55] eating this little thing? It's all
[1:11:57] yours. Go and enjoy it." Right? You look
[1:11:59] at the value of that banquet a bit
[1:12:01] differently. And when you realize that
[1:12:03] that day on Calvary that total
[1:12:05] deliverance was purchased for you in
[1:12:07] full, I mean, you don't have to be a
[1:12:09] part-time Christian. You can be a
[1:12:10] full-time believer. Amen. That the
[1:12:12] rapture was purchased for you. It's all
[1:12:14] paid in full. Healing was paid for.
[1:12:17] Deliverance was paid for. The peace of
[1:12:19] God was paid for. Amen. Every redemptive
[1:12:21] blessing of that God has given us was
[1:12:24] paid for that day on Calvary in full.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's also it's also not only
[1:12:30] that, but then you'll also see your
[1:12:32] value in that. Amen. Cuz why? It wasn't
[1:12:35] the blood of a Jew that we're redeemed
[1:12:37] by. It wasn't the blood of a Gentile. It
[1:12:39] was the blood of God that was shed.
[1:12:41] Amen. Amen. Every time someone buys
[1:12:44] something, you put a greater value of
[1:12:45] the thing you're buying than your own
[1:12:46] money. Otherwise, you wouldn't buy it.
[1:12:48] Amen. So Jesus, when he died on Calvary,
[1:12:51] he placed a greater value on you than
[1:12:53] his own life. This was the son of God.
[1:12:56] This was Emmanuel. This is the blood of
[1:12:58] Jesus Christ. This was not the blood of
[1:12:59] a Jew or Gentile. This was God's blood
[1:13:02] was shed. He paid he paid for it in full
[1:13:05] because he put greater value on you than
[1:13:08] he did himself.
[1:13:11] So if you keep now if you keep Calvary
[1:13:13] before you. Amen. What are you keeping
[1:13:15] before you? One the fact that every
[1:13:17] redemptive blessing is yours. Amen. But
[1:13:19] then another thing is that you are
[1:13:21] valuable. You are of great value. Amen.
[1:13:24] You see and what does it do? It will
[1:13:26] break you out of everything that's not
[1:13:27] of God. Amen. Brother Brown would tell
[1:13:30] the story of a of a of a young girl that
[1:13:33] had a had a heart trouble before she was
[1:13:36] healed with a physical heart condition.
[1:13:37] He tells a story that now she had a
[1:13:39] spiritual heart condition, a spiritual
[1:13:41] heart trouble. Her lover had run off and
[1:13:43] married some other woman and yet she was
[1:13:45] still in love. This boy telling that she
[1:13:47] um he was in love with her yet uh yet he
[1:13:50] said his father had caused it. Now so so
[1:13:53] his his value of her was actually just
[1:13:55] to use her for an emotional need but
[1:13:58] didn't really love her. And then so so
[1:14:01] and then um and then brother says um he
[1:14:04] said oh nonsense he didn't have to marry
[1:14:06] the other girl he did it because he
[1:14:08] failed to have the right kind of love
[1:14:09] for you. That's right. But but see being
[1:14:12] out all wound up into that the girl sat
[1:14:14] there in such a stoop like and said oh I
[1:14:16] know Johnny loves me. I know. See that's
[1:14:19] all she could see. She lived in that one
[1:14:21] little world by herself. She had formed
[1:14:23] herself in there. So, she had devalued
[1:14:26] herself because her true value was, "I'm
[1:14:29] better than that. I'm better than being
[1:14:32] being just manipulated by a boy that's
[1:14:33] run off and married someone else and
[1:14:35] living under a false pretense. I
[1:14:37] actually have so much value that I
[1:14:40] deserve to live by the truth of the
[1:14:41] situation." Amen. But then she had
[1:14:44] formed this little world and that how
[1:14:45] many people live this little world
[1:14:47] because they devalue themselves that
[1:14:49] they make their value just a just a just
[1:14:52] a doom scroller going through life doom
[1:14:54] scrolling through so social media you're
[1:14:57] far greater value than that consuming
[1:14:59] the filth that comes out of Hollywood.
[1:15:01] You're greater value than that. Amen.
[1:15:03] But you see she had formed her little
[1:15:04] self in there. She didn't see her value.
[1:15:07] And then he says, "I took the hold of
[1:15:08] her hand and said, "Listen to me." And
[1:15:10] the Lord showed a vision, you know, and
[1:15:11] she knowed, I know nothing about that
[1:15:13] something had taken place. Some
[1:15:15] transaction between them. And when that
[1:15:17] was said, then that snapped her right
[1:15:19] quick. I said, "Now, while you're out of
[1:15:21] there, look to Calvary. Look to your
[1:15:24] value. Look to what Jesus did for you."
[1:15:26] Amen. there. You're going uh you're
[1:15:29] going out here and trying to start to
[1:15:31] drink a minister's daughter, a
[1:15:32] Pentecostal minister's daughter, and
[1:15:34] doing the things you're doing, trying to
[1:15:36] drown that sorrow, that man, and so many
[1:15:38] don't even care the snap of their finger
[1:15:40] for you. I said, look, yondered to
[1:15:41] Calvary. That's the only way back. Why?
[1:15:45] Look to your true value.
[1:15:47] Look to your true value. I mean, you are
[1:15:49] far more valuable than being a drunkard.
[1:15:52] That sitting in a stouper in a little
[1:15:54] world, you're far more valuable than
[1:15:55] that to God. Amen. See, we've got to get
[1:15:58] ourselves focused to whether we live or
[1:15:59] die, single joint. It's Calvary Christ.
[1:16:02] That's the thing that God wants us to
[1:16:03] come back to. What? To look at our true
[1:16:06] value.
[1:16:07] Do you know you're valuable?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; In here, do you know you're valuable?
[1:16:12] Not in here. Do you know in here?
[1:16:16] Amen.
[1:16:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; See, what did he do? Jesus the joy that
[1:16:23] was set before him endured the cross
[1:16:25] despising the shame. That word despise
[1:16:27] means to think little of. So he thought
[1:16:30] little of the shame being stripped naked
[1:16:32] uh humiliated made fun of marred more
[1:16:34] than any other man hanging between
[1:16:36] heavens and earth on a cross. He thought
[1:16:38] little of that compared to what he
[1:16:40] thought of you. Amen. He he put the
[1:16:42] suffering he had to go through of little
[1:16:44] value compared to the value of you. Cuz
[1:16:46] there's a joy set before him which was
[1:16:48] you redeemed made in his image. him and
[1:16:50] you becoming one. That was the value he
[1:16:53] put upon you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're bought with a great price.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; We are not our own. We're bought with a
[1:17:00] great price. You have great value.
[1:17:01] Silver and gold cannot give you
[1:17:03] salvation. Nothing in h stocks and
[1:17:06] bonds, commodities, nothing can actually
[1:17:08] purchase your human soul. That's how
[1:17:10] great a value you are. It took the life
[1:17:12] of God, Amen, to be to be given. Amen.
[1:17:16] That you could receive eternal life.
[1:17:19] Now, what does this do? This this
[1:17:23] produces Now, if we realize our value
[1:17:25] that we're the children of God, it will
[1:17:28] do like it did with Jesus. Jesus knew
[1:17:30] who he was. He knew his value. Amen. He
[1:17:33] knew he was more than just a man from
[1:17:36] Nazareth. He knew he is more than just a
[1:17:38] babe born in a manger. He knew the
[1:17:40] purpose, the value that was placed upon
[1:17:43] his life as the lamb of God. So because
[1:17:46] he knew his value, it gave him a perfect
[1:17:49] faith. I'm just kind of turning this
[1:17:50] because he knew who he was. Amen. Do you
[1:17:53] know who you are this morning? You do
[1:17:55] you know your true value? That you're an
[1:17:57] attribute of God in flesh. Amen. You are
[1:17:59] the wife of Jesus Christ. You're more
[1:18:01] than a church member. You're more than
[1:18:02] just a message believer. Amen. Believe
[1:18:05] in God sent a prophet. No, you're part
[1:18:06] of the word. You're part of the eternal.
[1:18:09] Amen. You are a gene seed of God. You're
[1:18:11] part of him. And he can't lose part of
[1:18:13] himself. Amen. He knew who he was. And
[1:18:16] knowing who you are goes beyond your
[1:18:18] state and your condition. No, you're a
[1:18:20] son or a daughter of God. Once a son,
[1:18:23] always a son.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may go left and right like the
[1:18:28] prodal, but God will bring you back
[1:18:29] because he had to come to himself and
[1:18:31] know his true value. Amen. So what did
[1:18:34] he do? He came to himself. Came out of
[1:18:36] the pig pen. He realized my value is
[1:18:38] greater than starving feeding pigs in a
[1:18:40] strange land. My value is actually I'm a
[1:18:43] son of my father. I'm going home. But he
[1:18:45] still devalued himself to say I'm not
[1:18:47] worthy to be called a son. I'll just be
[1:18:49] a servant. But his father was not
[1:18:52] interested in him living with that false
[1:18:54] balance of living with an idea he's just
[1:18:56] a servant. No, he wanted to restore him
[1:18:59] as a full son. Not even under a a
[1:19:02] probation period of a you better you
[1:19:05] better pull your socks up and behave for
[1:19:06] 90 days then you're a son again. The
[1:19:09] father wasn't interested in that. He
[1:19:10] wanted his his child, his son to see his
[1:19:13] value back in his position in the
[1:19:15] family. And that's what God wants us to
[1:19:17] see as well, that we are not servants
[1:19:19] based on what we've done. Amen. We're
[1:19:21] not secondass citizens based on our
[1:19:23] background or the things we even did
[1:19:24] last week. That doesn't make us know we
[1:19:26] are his children. Amen. And God through
[1:19:29] the message of the hour has given a full
[1:19:31] restoration that we're joint ears with
[1:19:33] Christ. Amen. That we are part of the
[1:19:34] family of God. God never saved you to
[1:19:37] make you a servant. No, he saved you
[1:19:39] because you are his children.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so uh Jesus
[1:19:45] could Jesus could um he he knew who he
[1:19:48] was and that gave him perfect faith.
[1:19:50] Now, the Lord Jesus knew his value. He
[1:19:54] knew his value. And I pray that we would
[1:19:56] know as we are known that God's value he
[1:19:59] placed on you, you would know that same
[1:20:00] value. And so, Satan, Satan tried to
[1:20:04] because this is what Satan does. Satan
[1:20:07] in the wilderness when he was tempting
[1:20:08] Jesus was trying to work out what Jesus'
[1:20:11] value was because when you know a value
[1:20:13] of something you can buy it right who's
[1:20:16] ever heard a piece of artwork is
[1:20:17] priceless well I need a value even the
[1:20:21] richest person in the world if you you
[1:20:23] know if you're as rich as Elon Musk you
[1:20:25] know you you could buy Buckingham Palace
[1:20:27] you could buy whatever but if they say
[1:20:28] it's priceless you say well obviously
[1:20:30] this thing's not for sale but if you
[1:20:32] know the value of it then you can say
[1:20:33] well I'll pay I have this so I'm going
[1:20:35] to buy it So, Satan wanted dominion over
[1:20:37] our Lord Jesus. So, through those
[1:20:39] temptations, he is trying to work out
[1:20:41] what will Jesus sell himself for. What
[1:20:44] does Jesus know his value is? You see,
[1:20:48] but but but what happened is is Jesus
[1:20:51] rebuffed every attempt of the devil
[1:20:53] against them because Jesus knew who he
[1:20:55] was that he could not be bought. His
[1:20:58] value was far above being under the
[1:21:00] leadership of Satan because because what
[1:21:03] was see Satan pointed out the rocks to
[1:21:05] Jesus. If you be the son of God, turn
[1:21:07] them into bread, right? So what would he
[1:21:10] turn them into bread? He would have been
[1:21:11] following the leadership of the devil to
[1:21:14] use the gift in his life for himself.
[1:21:18] And so what does what does the devil do?
[1:21:19] Like Elvis, he sold his gift for a fleet
[1:21:22] of Cadillacs. Many other people sell a
[1:21:24] gift that God's given them. Amen. what
[1:21:27] to do because because Satan will always
[1:21:30] give you an offer like he did Jesus cuz
[1:21:33] he cuz he want Satan wants to see what
[1:21:36] value have you placed upon you
[1:21:39] cuz whatever value that you believe you
[1:21:41] are that's how you conduct yourself.
[1:21:44] Amen. Like brother Bram would tell the
[1:21:46] story of the slave slave buyer there in
[1:21:48] America before slavery was outlawed. He
[1:21:50] went to a plantation. He saw a bunch of
[1:21:52] slaves but there was one young man that
[1:21:53] was different. he can, you know, and
[1:21:55] then and then so the slave buyer was
[1:21:56] talking to the plantation owner and
[1:21:58] said, "Well, I want to buy him." But you
[1:22:01] see, the plantation owner knew the value
[1:22:03] of that slave. He said, "He's not for
[1:22:05] sale." And then so the slave buyer asked
[1:22:07] the plantation owner, "Well, what's the
[1:22:09] why is he different?" You know, does he
[1:22:11] eat different food? No, he eats the same
[1:22:13] food. Does he sleep in a different
[1:22:14] quarters? No. He's, you know, he sleeps
[1:22:17] in the same place. Is he a boss over
[1:22:18] them? No. He's just like one of them.
[1:22:20] What makes him different? And the and
[1:22:22] the plantation owner could have said he
[1:22:24] knows his value because he was a son of
[1:22:27] the king in Africa. He was a royal
[1:22:29] prince. Amen. Though he wasn't living in
[1:22:32] his kingdom and probably never could go
[1:22:33] back to his kingdom to take his father's
[1:22:36] throne, he knew his value. No matter
[1:22:39] where he was, the conditions he was in,
[1:22:40] he knew his value. So he decided because
[1:22:43] I'm royal, I have value. I'm not going
[1:22:46] to stoop down like the rest of everyone
[1:22:48] else. I'm going to conduct myself as a
[1:22:50] prince even though I'm a slave. And
[1:22:52] friends, if he could know his value,
[1:22:56] how much more you and I as the sons and
[1:22:57] daughters of Jesus Christ. Amen. That we
[1:23:00] don't need to stoop ourselves down and
[1:23:01] devalue who we are. But we can live
[1:23:04] according to our value. And this is what
[1:23:06] Jesus did. He lived according to his
[1:23:08] value. He knew he was he was priceless
[1:23:11] cuz he was the lamb of God. Amen. of
[1:23:14] Satan would come to him and try and try
[1:23:16] and get him to use his power for his own
[1:23:18] benefit. Like Elvis would sell his gift
[1:23:20] and so on. But of course he said, you
[1:23:22] know, get behind me, Satan, man shall
[1:23:23] live by bread alone, but every word that
[1:23:25] proceeds out of the mouth of God. And
[1:23:27] then Satan would take him up to the top
[1:23:28] of the temple and throw himself off and
[1:23:30] well, Satan would try and get him to
[1:23:32] throw himself off, you know, twisting
[1:23:33] the scripture to make him again do
[1:23:35] something to make himself a name. And
[1:23:38] then finally, Satan took him and showed
[1:23:40] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:23:42] said, "If you if you bow down and
[1:23:44] worship me, I'll give you all of these."
[1:23:46] You see, this is the value. You see,
[1:23:48] Satan's value of the Lord Jesus was
[1:23:49] going up. You'll be king of the world.
[1:23:52] Just bow down. And you see what happens
[1:23:54] is Satan will put a valuation on you. If
[1:23:58] you have a very great gift, he sees a
[1:24:00] great potential in you, he'll promise
[1:24:01] you the world. You want a private jet,
[1:24:03] you want a private island, you sign this
[1:24:05] contract. You'll be a mear. Everyone
[1:24:07] will love you. All the women will flock
[1:24:09] at you and all the men and all these
[1:24:10] things and you can have whatever you
[1:24:11] want. Or he'll just give you a little
[1:24:14] kingdom. You can be cool at school, man.
[1:24:16] You can be one of the popular kids.
[1:24:18] You've always wanted to be accepted.
[1:24:21] This is what he does. He'll give you a
[1:24:22] small kingdom. Everyone will like you.
[1:24:25] Just don't be so overboard with this
[1:24:27] Christianity stuff. This message is old
[1:24:28] fat. No, no, don't worry about I'll give
[1:24:30] you this. Look what you could be. What
[1:24:33] does he do? He's putting a value and
[1:24:34] he's trying to see will you sell out for
[1:24:37] that value? Is that the value you've
[1:24:38] placed on your life just to be a cool
[1:24:40] kid or you'll be the popular guy in the
[1:24:43] office or the popular girl or whatever
[1:24:45] more? You know, you'll be you'll be
[1:24:46] that. Is that all we are? We have far
[1:24:49] more value than being the cool kid.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; You know, you people people get so
[1:24:55] gripped about they got to have the
[1:24:56] perfect body and the perfect hair and
[1:24:57] the perfect all they're doing is
[1:24:59] devaluing themselves to be some sex bait
[1:25:01] for someone. We have far more value than
[1:25:04] that. Or people say, "What's the use in
[1:25:07] trying and throw themselves at any boy
[1:25:08] or girl that come their way?" Believe it
[1:25:10] or not, don't devalue yourself. You got
[1:25:13] way more value than you realize. But
[1:25:15] it's the enemy trying to give you an
[1:25:17] empty promise cuz he's trying to buy
[1:25:19] you. You got to realize, no, I am I am
[1:25:22] priceless. You can't put a human you
[1:25:25] can't put a value on me because I've
[1:25:27] been bought with the blood of Jesus
[1:25:28] Christ. Amen. You can't buy me. have
[1:25:31] already been bought.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't don't devalue. Let's not
[1:25:36] devalue ourselves. You know, brother
[1:25:38] Brown says the three temptations
[1:25:39] especially for a ministers money, woman,
[1:25:41] and popularity. I say those three things
[1:25:44] are a big problem. Especially
[1:25:46] popularity. This is even us people. I
[1:25:49] just want to be popular. I want to be
[1:25:51] accepted. I want to be the, you know, in
[1:25:53] with the incrowd.
[1:25:55] You know, there's one incrowd you want
[1:25:56] to be in.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's the one that's going to heaven.
[1:25:59] That's the eternal incrowd. I'd rather
[1:26:01] be accepted up there and turned down
[1:26:03] down here than the other way around.
[1:26:07] Our value is far more greater. Don't
[1:26:11] don't devalue yourself
[1:26:14] based on, you know, based on the lies of
[1:26:17] the enemy. You know, people become
[1:26:19] obsessed. Well, I just got to get the
[1:26:21] girls to chase me and that's my value.
[1:26:23] You're far more valuable than that. Or I
[1:26:25] got to get the boys to chase me. You're
[1:26:27] far more valuable than that. I've got to
[1:26:29] have the big house, the big job, the big
[1:26:31] your life is far more val,
[1:26:34] but that should not be what you place
[1:26:35] your value on or the circle of friends
[1:26:38] or the number of likes you have or any
[1:26:40] of those things. Don't be devalued to
[1:26:42] that value.
[1:26:45] We are sons and daughters of God.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why that's why the Lord
[1:26:50] Jesus because he knew his value.
[1:26:53] He did not bow to any any temptation
[1:26:56] that the devil gave him cuz he knew his
[1:26:59] value. Do you know your value this
[1:27:01] morning?
[1:27:04] I trust you do.
[1:27:08] Amen. Brother says this. Now remember
[1:27:09] this. Christ and the true church is a
[1:27:11] continuation of the book of Acts. But
[1:27:13] the book of Revelation shows it how the
[1:27:15] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:27:17] church and defile it, making it
[1:27:19] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It
[1:27:21] exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[1:27:23] which is the attempted destruction of
[1:27:25] God's people and the discrediting of
[1:27:27] God's word, right down to the time he's
[1:27:28] cast into the lake of fire. He fights
[1:27:30] that. He cannot stand it. He knows if
[1:27:33] the people get the true revelation of
[1:27:35] the true church and what she is, what
[1:27:39] are you the purchase of his blood? Amen.
[1:27:42] Attribute of God and flesh, part of his
[1:27:44] word. Bone was bone, flesh was flesh,
[1:27:46] life is life. Amen. You're part of him.
[1:27:49] Amen. This is what you are. You're not
[1:27:51] just a church group. You're not just a
[1:27:53] Christian, if I put it that way. No,
[1:27:55] you're the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:27:58] You're you're a redeemed son or daughter
[1:28:00] of God. That's what you are. Amen. You
[1:28:03] get the revelation. I'm valuable.
[1:28:06] I'm not just some commodity. I'm not
[1:28:08] just an object that God has got a hold
[1:28:10] of. No, he loves me and respects me for
[1:28:12] who I am as a person. He puts great
[1:28:14] value on me. Like brother Am says, he
[1:28:16] God wants Christians to be happy cuz he
[1:28:19] puts great value on you.
[1:28:22] Amen.
[1:28:24] What she stands for and that she can do
[1:28:26] the greater work, she will be an
[1:28:27] invincible army. If they get a true
[1:28:29] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:28:31] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:28:33] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:28:35] Antichrist spirit, Satan will be
[1:28:37] powerless before her. He will be
[1:28:39] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[1:28:41] withtood his every effort to gain power
[1:28:43] over him in the desert. Why? Because he
[1:28:46] knew who he was. So he could withstand
[1:28:48] his attacks. When we realize what we are
[1:28:51] and who we are, we can turn down every
[1:28:54] one of his temptations.
[1:28:56] Wanting to be the big shot.
[1:29:00] You're more valuable than that.
[1:29:03] I want to be the big person. No, the
[1:29:05] only big person is Jesus Christ.
[1:29:08] Amen. Yes. Satan hates revelation, but
[1:29:11] we love it. With true revelation in our
[1:29:13] lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:29:15] against us, but we will prevail over
[1:29:18] them. Why? Cuz you realize you're
[1:29:20] valuable. You're more valuable than the
[1:29:22] spirit trying to tempt you to to to be
[1:29:24] led by it. No. Do you know you know an
[1:29:27] evil spirit is just a fallen angel
[1:29:30] that's been fired out of heaven.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; That's all it's all an evil. So a lust
[1:29:35] spirit is a fallen angel. Pride is a
[1:29:37] fallen angel, malice, strife, back,
[1:29:40] gossip. It's all Why? Why be known as a
[1:29:42] gossiper? You're devaluing yourself. Why
[1:29:44] not be a carrier of truth at edifying
[1:29:46] the body? Amen. Why? Why not be someone
[1:29:49] who's comfortable in their own skin?
[1:29:51] Jesus Jesus was very comfortable in who
[1:29:53] he was. He wasn't put out when someone
[1:29:56] tried to be greater and more and
[1:29:57] expressive. No, he knew who he was.
[1:30:00] Amen. He wasn't he would not let himself
[1:30:02] be devalued to become part of some
[1:30:04] carnal pecking order.
[1:30:07] Right?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; So I trust you realize that you're very
[1:30:12] valuable.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Because remember, you've got a soul
[1:30:16] that's worth 10,000 worlds. You can't
[1:30:19] put a value on 10,000 worlds. They don't
[1:30:21] even know what the value of this earth
[1:30:22] is. They don't know what's in the crust
[1:30:25] terms of precious metals and different
[1:30:26] things. They don't know the value of
[1:30:28] this earth. Hey, I say you just take
[1:30:30] that into the spiritual. The world does
[1:30:32] not know the value of you. But God knows
[1:30:35] the value of this earth and and he knows
[1:30:37] the value of this earth.
[1:30:40] Right? So if my soul is worth more than
[1:30:42] 10,000 worlds, that means Jesus paid
[1:30:45] more than that when he died on Calvary.
[1:30:48] Right? And that's how valuable I am in
[1:30:50] his sight. And if that's the value he's
[1:30:52] put upon me, then therefore I'm going to
[1:30:55] conduct myself that I'm more valuable
[1:30:58] than stooping down and being devalued
[1:31:00] and being led about by the spirit of
[1:31:01] this world.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a song and maybe No, I
[1:31:06] don't know. Well, I don't think we've
[1:31:07] ever sung it here,
[1:31:10] but here's a maybe the musicians can
[1:31:12] come just with this. This is this is my
[1:31:13] closing summary. This is from the song
[1:31:15] Worth.
[1:31:17] You thought I was worth saving, so you
[1:31:19] came and changed my life. See, he
[1:31:22] thought you were worth saving. You had
[1:31:24] value. You thought I was worth keeping.
[1:31:28] That's the value he put upon you. So you
[1:31:30] clean me up inside. You thought I was to
[1:31:33] die for. So you sacri sacrificed your
[1:31:36] life so I could be free. So I could be
[1:31:39] whole. So I could tell everyone I know.
[1:31:42] That's the value he put upon you. That
[1:31:45] you were worth saving. You are worth
[1:31:47] keeping.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; You are to die for.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; That's how valuable you are. That's the
[1:31:52] value that God has placed upon you. And
[1:31:55] if you have the revelation, I am
[1:31:56] priceless. It doesn't make you proud.
[1:31:59] Doesn't make you arrogant. It makes you
[1:32:00] truly humble that God would pay the
[1:32:03] ultimate price. Amen. For me who is
[1:32:06] priceless.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And that means you're not going to stoop
[1:32:09] down and be led by a spirit of this
[1:32:11] world because I'm more valuable than
[1:32:12] them. Why would Look at this. the king
[1:32:15] of glory. You just wait, let's go back
[1:32:17] to this slide here. Wouldn't it be
[1:32:20] because because it's very simple to say,
[1:32:22] wouldn't you agree? Isn't it ridiculous
[1:32:25] for the devil to think that the Lord
[1:32:27] Jesus would follow him?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Who's Satan? He's an archangel that's
[1:32:32] fallen from heaven. He has no position.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He's the king of the bottomless pit.
[1:32:37] There's there's no foundation. He's got
[1:32:39] nothing to give anybody. He's got no
[1:32:42] heaven. He's got no eternal life. He's
[1:32:44] got nothing but torment and trouble.
[1:32:46] Right? Even hell's not his. It was made
[1:32:48] for him, but it's not his. Right? So,
[1:32:50] isn't it ridiculous that Satan thinks he
[1:32:53] can offer Jesus, who's the word made
[1:32:56] flesh, something
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; that he would give himself for? We
[1:33:00] think, of course, that's ridiculous.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; What do you place yourself there being
[1:33:04] tempted by Satan? Don't you think it's
[1:33:06] ridiculous that the devil would try and
[1:33:08] come and try and buy the bride of Jesus
[1:33:10] Christ with a temptation when she has
[1:33:12] heaven. She's got streets of gold. She's
[1:33:14] going to overcome his throne. She's got
[1:33:17] eternal life. She's got a rapture to
[1:33:18] step into. She's got her redeemed ones
[1:33:21] coming with her. She's got her family
[1:33:23] being saved. She's got the word of God
[1:33:25] and flesh in her. She's got every divine
[1:33:27] promise. She's got a eternal body
[1:33:29] waiting in the heavens.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; That's ridiculous. Hey,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; well then next time the devil comes your
[1:33:35] way and tempts you, say, "No, I'm more
[1:33:38] valuable than that. You can't buy me,
[1:33:40] Satan. I've been bought with the blood
[1:33:42] of Jesus Christ, and I'm of great value
[1:33:44] to God." So don't let the devil ever try
[1:33:47] and devalue yourself in your own eyes.
[1:33:49] I'm nothing. I'm not important. Nobody
[1:33:51] cares. God cares.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; God cares. If God cares, that means the
[1:33:56] main one cares. The important man cares.
[1:33:58] If he cares that I'm cared for. If he
[1:34:00] thought of me, then I'm thought of.
[1:34:02] Amen. If he remembers me, I'm not
[1:34:03] forgotten.
[1:34:05] Amen. So, next time the devil comes your
[1:34:09] way, don't stoop down to his what he's
[1:34:12] trying to buy you with. So, no, no. I'm
[1:34:13] more I'm more valuable than this.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we this
[1:34:18] morning? Let's just leave it there.
[1:34:19] Amen. But you're of great value. People
[1:34:21] of great value.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I can't ensure you that's how valuable
[1:34:25] you are, but God has. Amen. With his
[1:34:28] blood.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's um you got a
[1:34:31] song? You got a song, brother Isaac?
[1:34:33] Sorry.

[2:01:56] And every desire is now [music]
[2:02:00] satisfied
[2:02:02] here in your love.
[2:02:07] Oh, [music] there's nothing
[2:02:10] better than you. There is nothing
[2:02:15] better than you, Lord. [music] There's
[2:02:17] nothing,
[2:02:20] nothing [singing] is better than you.
[2:02:25] [music] So I'm not afraid
[2:02:30] to show [music] you my weakness,
[2:02:35] my [singing] failures of course. [music]
[2:02:37] Lord, you've seen them all. Can you
[2:02:40] still call me friend?
[2:02:44] [music] He's the God of the mountain.
[2:02:49] He's the God of a valley.
[2:02:51] [singing and music]
[2:02:54] Oh, there's not a place your mercy
[2:02:57] [music]
[2:02:58] and grace won't find me again.
[2:03:03] [music]
[2:03:04] Oh, there's nothing
[2:03:08] better than you. There [music] is
[2:03:10] nothing
[2:03:12] better than you. There is nothing
[2:03:17] nothing [singing] is better than you.
[2:03:20] [music]
[2:03:21] There is nothing.
[2:03:24] Oh, there's nothing

[2:03:28] There is nothing
[2:03:32] better than you. But [music] there's
[2:03:34] nothing
[2:03:37] nothing is better than you. [music]
[2:03:41] Your morning to dancing.
[2:03:44] You turn [music] morning to dancing.
[2:03:49] You give beauty for ashes.
[2:03:53] [music]
[2:03:54] You turn shame into glory.
[2:03:58] [music] You're the only one who can. You
[2:04:02] turn morning. [music] You turn morning
[2:04:05] [singing] to dying.
[2:04:09] You give beauty for ashes.
[2:04:13] [music] You turn shame into glory.
[2:04:17] You're the only one who cares. [music]
[2:04:23] You turn gra into garden.
[2:04:28] You turn [music] bones into aries.
[2:04:33] You turn [music] seas into highways.
[2:04:37] You're the only one who cares. [music]
[2:04:43] And you turn gra [singing] into garden.
[2:04:48] You turn bones into high.
[2:04:50] [singing and music]
[2:04:53] You turn seas into highways.
[2:04:57] You're [music] the only one who can.
[2:05:02] There is nothing
[2:05:04] [music and singing]
[2:05:04] There's nothing
[2:05:07] better than you. There is nothing
[2:05:12] better than you, Lord.
[2:05:14] [music and singing] There's nothing
[2:05:17] nothing is better than you.
[2:05:22] There is nothing.
[2:05:24] Lord, there's nothing
[2:05:27] better than you. [music and singing]
[2:05:29] There is nothing
[2:05:32] better than you. Lord, there's nothing
[2:05:37] nothing is better than you.
[2:05:42] There is nothing
[2:05:44] Oh, there's [music and singing] nothing
