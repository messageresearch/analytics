Lord and we love to hear you in Jesus Christ now amen Glory Hallelujah well I turned angles amen well praise the lord it's good to be back amen I want to greet you all in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I just want to thank brother Ben for this opportunity again to minister the word hallelujah and I'm very nervous for some reason um I don't know you know sometimes you just get real nervous and praise the Lord we're just trusting in Him who trusts the Lord hallelujah I believe it's a good place to be hallelujah amen why we're standing thank you musicians amen hallelujah Oh Glory I'm feeling his presence man that's a good place I like being here there's no place like home amen we're a blessed bunch of people you know that we're real blessed Oh Glory you know we just kind of touched little bits here and there of how good he is and how good it is to be amongst his people and tonight may the Lord help us to just say a few things that would um encourage us and to oh yeah just encourage us amen let's turn to Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 to 5. and then we'll turn to 2p to one verses 19 to 21. and we're going to read scriptures here that have traditionally been very lofty ideas and lofty Revelations and events that have happened to the age and to dispensations and the great things that's happened in our generation but tonight I want you to make this personal and I believe that this is personal hey man Hallelujah amen I kind of preached a little bit of these things over there in Africa and I just had such a wonderful time and you know I was just listening to all the things that's been ministered at the at both meetings so we've heard all of that and um yeah I just was so encouraged I thought man I yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah I won't leave you standing too much longer let's just read Glory um and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another Angel another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints are you glad that this has happened okay we're speaking about an event that's happened and it's happening okay it's happened and it's happening okay it's a it goes from age to individual amen hallelujah just so it's not just done and it's finished it's kind of happening still now in your life amen everyone say my life amen that's right that's happening to you hallelujah it's happening to me that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire off the Altar and cast it into the Earth aren't you glad for fire the fire of God Amen who loves the fire of God it does good things to our lives amen hallelujah burns out all the evil and the accentuates the good amen and Angel uh and cast it into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and an earthquake amen and 2 Peter 1 19-21 and it says just say Amen if you had your finger there is everyone there Hallelujah we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where until you do well that you take heed amen as unto a light that shines in a dark place Hallelujah unto the and now like so Peter's saying this for them then because it was happening light was shining in darkness but now he's going to speak of an event that's too still to take place in the future of their dispensation and now he says until so it's got this light's going to shine in a dark place until the day Dawn so now the coming of the Lord right so the so the light of the Gospel is going to shine all around the world it's going to shine through the apostolic move and through every Church age in darkness but then one day the day's gonna Dawn one day the coming of the Lord is going to take place right do you believe that okay let's see where it happens and the day start arrives where in your heart amen that's a very powerful thing and I pray that the Lord will reveal it to you not as a Doctrine but as an experience who wants that experience amen hallelujah I believe we're living in the age and the time and the hour where this is personal amen you may be seated I feel like I'm going to preach and I'm going to keep you standing too long so I'll just let you sit down Hallelujah so it says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation Hallelujah not just something you work out and you try and do in your own strength something that you try and make happen and you get excited and for me I have to surrender my own enthusiasm to stop making things happen around me whether it's natural things or even spiritual things right Hallelujah because different personalities they have different negative sides to them that can make us do things outside of the will of God and I want to touch on um that later on if the Lord be willing if we get to it for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of men but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost wait on the Lord wait on your ministry don't don't try even though because you know now we're in the eagle age we can see right and we've got this great advantage to see and we've we can see everything that's gone on and happen and why and it's all built up and then we and as you and with the same Eagle anointing you begin to see the future because we've had a prophet a major prophet like Moses and Joshua come down in our day in the spirit of Elijah to come and give us that Vision now we can see what's going to happen but let's not try and make it happen hey man let's wait on our ministry right we've got to be patient with God true patience is not patience with men that's easy it's patience with God that's the thing amen patience with God and over the age we've seen many times and this is what causes politics in the message this is what causes troubles is when we go and try and do something in our own strength out of enthusiasm or out of seeing a vision seeing Revelation come and then teaching it rather than experiencing the reality of it you catch that because we can teach the seventh seal we can teach all these things that's happened the great events that's taken place in the coming of the Lord in our generation we can teach that but it's not Doctrine it's got to be an experience because the coming of the Lord is an event it's an event that happens on an individual level so as a collective we get raptured from the Lord himself who comes down into our lives to Rapture us out in a greater measure than any church has ever had it it's a cataclysmic change of dispensation in the end time who's who's with me on that who knows I don't understand but there had to come a time where we turned the corner and instead of just building on all of these denominational ideas and Roman Catholicism and all that big primordial soup if anyone knows what that means you can have a laugh at me I won't even go into it it's not worth it but I'm a time where we had to come out of all of that right and come into a New and Living Way of true restoration even further back than the apostles went amen now our hearts have been turned back to the hearts of our fathers right and we've always gone it's just to the apostles but it's further than the apostles it's back to the original religion that job was talked about that God spoke to job about that in the mind of God an eternity that never began and never ended you were dancing you were shouting and you were rejoicing and you were singing now right now you think oh my I had a beginning I was born and how could that be and yes we're in a little hickey of time but when you get back into eternity it's going to be like you never began oh my I can see smoke coming out of the ears Smoke's coming out but who cares let's just rejoice in the fact that that's you sometimes we don't understand it because we're we're in time right and you get so used to time and everything you begin this and then you finish there and you were born there and that one and and it's all we know right but God's eternal like this will bubble our mind if we really think about this Jesus standing before the Pharisees in his life and they're telling him oh you were how could Abraham know your day and then and then Jesus says before Abraham was I am I am it's like how does it work and so he would if it was a future thing he would say I am not I will be because he is he's an ever-present and not ever present in time ever present in eternity time is if he is even prison he's looking at time like this here's the Eden here's whatever civilizations he's done and started and wherever and here's the end of it but he's looking beyond that he's like oh yeah there and there and you pinned that down there and that down there and that there but he's looking Beyond it man Laurie it's cold here that's cool here I'm telling you oh mate but that was real hot over there my goodness amen I used to think it was hot here man oh my if you wanna you want Fitness you go over there and start ministering man brother and Paul knows about this my goodness hallelujah amen the prophet says this now I want to speak on a subject and I just kind of want to lay a foundation and I was listening to brother Isaac and he says I'm not going to just preach this because I want you to get it and I thought Lord help me just to say these things first so I can lay that I tried every time and Lord help me I really you know I really want that to happen but I just get so excited and you guys start pulling and everything just happens I was listening to brother Branham today and he was like man I just and it was who do you say this is in the sermon and he and he sang after he'd he'd done the whole sermon two hours and he'd hadn't only touched one thing and he says oh the Holy Ghost just takes over and I just get to that one point and I've got this whole page as the points so I felt like I know exactly how he means because you know the Lord is you know I think we Avail ourselves to the Lord to the anointing to the spirit of God and it's like you just become a vessel that he wants to meet the needs of his people and and needs are being met you know and I I just encourage you like you know I mean you guys are primed man you've had amazing camps and conventions and just like well Hallelujah man Prime so you know just invite them to your Pew once more uh just just once more Lord hallelujah and uh you know let this kind of spectrums you could say of different Ministries and and they and they have a certain spectrum that they are they are really anointed to push and and to preach and so I just really the the thought today is our response to the third pool because see the third pull has been and I want to explain what the three pools are because you know there's probably people that maybe don't understand what I mean by this terminology so I'll just explain that but you know what is our response to this and when it's personal to you your response because you're experiencing it your response is worship our response is a celebration with with God we're not just like filling ourselves up with a revelation and knowledge and I can explain it all but I've experienced it and it's happened to me and it's changed my life and I'm responding out of something in me just bubbles out because it's gone beyond the head it's gone beyond my This Heart even has just gone deeper it's become my whole life it's like a little white button as the Holy Ghost comes into your life the you know it comes in small like a light comes into you and then he begins to press out and he begins to push out all the complexes and push out all those roots of bitterness and things that happened in your life that's hindered your worship and and cultural you know ideologies that have shaded over your vision and it begins to push those things aside to introduce to you a Heavenly culture to introduce to you a Heavenly race without color just a Heavenly race a Heavenly people a heavenly vision and a Heavenly viewpoint now if we bring our stuff in we're going to be like the first time David tried to bring the ark into into a city of David right and all it led to was death who knows how David when he became king he there was two ceremonies one ceremony was completely on a cart it was done by they thought they could do a better way and and the house of abinadab where they up had been for years and years they've decided they wanted a part of this so they just continued on but actually the time was changing and so they brought it all out and David didn't consult the prophet or the message he consulted the armies and he he went on a political level and they brought it in and all it led to was death but when it was done and you can see now we can make it personal in our life if you bring any of your own ideas to this if you bring all that stuff that you've learned from denominational Theology and all that stuff out of Babylon it's all going to end in death because it's corrupted you have to just let all that teaching and all that stuff and put it on the shelf and let God and His will and his program go beyond the doctrine now and become an experience to take that Ark and put it in your life take it out of the because a lot of when you receive God into your life it's sitting in there all that potential everything's a new but it's lying in a place where it cannot be manifested because of all these complexes and things that's you're holding on to and God will never defy your free will he will never just press through your own mentality you've got to allow him you've got to surrender you've got to trust him I think there was something up there that just said I know it was my calendar and it just said and all things just trust him true trust and I pray tonight we're going through all these things whether you're 7 or 70. more older or younger doesn't matter if you're out anywhere we're going through life and you know we if we want to do things and you have Ambitions and you have little dreams and Big Dreams and if you don't trust God you will try and take that into your hands and try and control that thing and try and make that happen and all it will end in is death that's all there's no other option it might take ages for that to happen but it'll happen eventually and now death is not just you dying physically and going to another dimension death is separation from God separation from God the Creator the the source of love the source of of all light and life and you get separated from that like what is it worth to have to be cool at school to be the one that Everyone likes to be good at this and that but if you just trust God just trust him and I pray Lord help us to trust them I know it sounds very uh rudimentary but trusting God is a very important thing wow Hallelujah so our response to the third pull the seventh seal brings him the prophet says this in Souls that are in prison this because I talk about the seventh seal right because we just read when the seventh seal was opened and there was silence in heaven and there is silence but there will be a time where that silence is broken because it was only half an hour right so he put a time limit on the silence half an hour I don't know what prophetic half an hour is had me how many years but God has a time with the silence will be broken and the sons of God and the daughters of God will speak and they'll be manifested and the Earth will ring again and it'll be the nature that's groaning for this will finally have peace because the sons of God are back what Adam lost and everything that he forfeited will be restored again in the earth and identity conditions will be back right amen the seventh seal as the coming of the Lord or in another um uh aspect that brings the Lord to the Earth it brings Christ to the Earth so that the prophet sees this in in one of his last sermons that he preached actually I think I know it was in 1963. so it was towards the end of his ministry and he says the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned I like that it claimed what he owned so Calvary and everything that he did his blood that was spilled on the Earth was to purchase you it was to purchase me it was to purchase what we have it was to purchase the Earth it was to purchase nature it was to purchase the Jews it was to purchase all that he owned but and and through that dispensation he began to share that light shined in darkness through the seven Church ages and he begins to set people free and Liberate the people and and bring the people back but then there would come a time right at the very end and according to Daniel it was the time when when knowledge shall increase and Men shall run to and fro so there would be a great traveling age and a great a great age of knowledge increasing that would be when the book would open and this would happen the seals would break right and it happened right 1963 a major event took place in Civilization the seals were open but what that was was the final Act of redemption to claim to himself everything that Calvary purchased because the purchase went and then he went searching and he went preaching and like shining in darkness but there had to come a time where all of it would open and then he would come down and he would take his bride out of the Earth and he would redeem us back so there had to come a time now that is the thing that brings people to a showdown can you receive that can you see that now the best thing to do in this situation is to neutralize everything and you're it you know and your ideas and and to say Lord is this true is this for me I I Lord I I if this is true this is cataclysmic this means great things and the coming of the Lord has begun because now he's come down he's revealed himself and he's come down into the people's hearts to redeem people back and take them and claim what is purchased so the first things that he claims because all those that have died in Christ all the way from Adam they've already they're already up in this situation but there's a people that he wants to display on the earth that are alive that are going to come all the way back to their origin living in the flesh it's like a showdown between God and Satan he's gonna say I can do this this is what my blood can do this is what my salvation can do this is how powerful I am I'm gonna take a bride who's in Satan's Eden and the greatest evil where knowledge is everywhere and iPads and phones and all the rubbish all over and not this she's gonna be just like me she's going to be redeemed out of the trash redeemed out of it and I know my own life I was in the real dark I was I was seriously in the dark drugs alcohol gangs the whole lot and he redeemed me Hallelujah if he could redeem me he can redeem you can redeem all and now he's searching because this is the time where it's not only will you believe and then die and then have a resurrection one day but there has to be a people that defy death there has to be something more than any other age something more that's the people that get victory over death itself and that's the only one that can do it is the one that abolished it he would come down in full measure he would come down and he would reveal himself in his people we've got something to celebrate we've got something to dance about we've got something to celebrate we've got something to talk about we're not just preaching denominational Theology of a God that died for us 2000 years ago and if you just believe and say the sinner's prayer you'll be saved and you'll come to the white Throne judgment too and then your sins and everything will be because you've you all you've done is come to a historical God but of that God if you really come as provided way and you get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins just as the apostles did and you come that provided way of true repentance from all that denominationalism all that darkness and truly enter into that and His holy ghost comes down into you you've got everything you've got it all you've got it all you've got the coming of the Lord in your heart that's not something else it's the Holy Ghost every age the Holy Ghost had a prerogative he had a plan he had a he had a dispensation to dispense right dispense something you dispense a whole lot of himself to the apostles and the angel Lord was there and they had an Apostolic age and so on and so forth all the way through Hallelujah he took a portion of himself the Earth the churches went into Dark Ages and denominationalism everywhere and it just was like a tyranny and then he began to restore back under Luther and Martin and Luther and Wesley and and brought it back up again Hallelujah and they had a portion of the Holy Spirit he gave them certain things to overcome in their day but then the seed has to return the fullness has to return where the fullness full measure of what went on the ground in the beginning and Christ himself would be manifested in his church so that the full seed and the life you know the seed has everything in it that was in the original plant it has to come back to seed again it's nature right it can't just remain a leaf what they had in the Lutheran day they had a leaf now the life was in the leaf it was green it photosynthesized the Sun but it was just it was just there right they were all there and all that denominationalism that came out in that day when God was there but what happened the purpose of the leaf is to bring the sunlight and turn it into some further part of the plant as it comes up as the shark and now well the tassel and then and that was like as the denominational tree was developing then it developed into the shuck and now look that was Pentecost and the charismatic movement and they're still around right in different countries it's in different conditions here it's completely lost they're completely in the world and they're attached to the world actually all denominations are attached by an umbilical cord to the world and as the world crumbles they crumble and as the world goes down you watch them they are going in Mosin and Mawson and they look like the world they act like the world their only way to keep people is to be like the world because they're attached now when they were in their Heyday when the life was in the plant and the Holy Ghost was pouring out the spiritual gifts that was good it was God but what they did a prophecy went forth on those early days of Pentecost and said do not denominate and do not put a uh uh what do you call that thing an evidence to the Holy Ghost baptism what effect did the Lord knew they were going to do it because man is man right as soon as fear comes in to try and control the denomination can keep what they had not realizing that God is more amen that God is so great there's a comma at the end of what we know there's a comma at the end of everything you believe right if there isn't you've denominated you're stuck you're there stagnated plateau that's all you'll ever do but if you just put a comma and you say God tonight so anyway the life was in them and and God told them do not denominate and this is in the early 1900s and do not put on evidence what do they do they place an Evidence of speaking in tongues is the sign that you were baptized with the Holy Ghost sealed to the day of your Redemption and many witches came into those services and spoken tongues through those people and they do today and they go off in tongues that's demons demons are cursing the church I'm telling you I've actually heard testimonies of ex-witches and warlocks and they were assigned to churches and every time those foolish people God bless them I pray for their salvation but every time they blab it away those demons and those witches would enter in and speak curses of lust fear and Division and whatever over the church and they had a great time in there they said the the churches that followed the word they couldn't do anything in them I mean they could cause a little bit of trouble but not like that because they had a tons and interpreter he said and they say when there's an interpreter now we already heard this in the message right now see the prophet doesn't go and explain all those things he just says don't do it and we think oh why and then that's why but one reason anyway God gives wisdom right Hallelujah so here's the shuck and you know the Pentecostal Church um the Heyday was all green and that shuck and the wheat looks just like the wheat almost except it's big and green and it's sticking up right very and all the gifts are there the the restoration of all the gifts that they denominated and they begin to fight and they had all these evidences and one went to extreme Oneness like your finger God is one like your finger and then one went to extreme trinitarian they polarized be careful you don't polarize in the message be careful you don't pull too far to one side in the message and go too far that way because responding to that we've heard that preach right don't let the reason that your stance is this because of anger or because you're fighting against something that's the wrong Foundation Hallelujah let God be let us will come wait on your ministry wait on God and let him move you let the spirit of God move you and so here they are in this great move of God but God wasn't finished with a shook even though it looked like it in Pentecost they thought that they were the very Cutting Edge and that was it God wasn't finished with the shark who knows anything about wheat and you can go research it the shark has to pull away and then what it does is it reveals this Grain on the inside and that grain the shuck the Pentecostal and charismatic move pulled away from the word unfortunately that's just nature and that's what happened they pulled away they rejected the message they begin to ostracize the prophet in his ministry and they pulled away because he basically told them they were living in sin and all those things and they had to come up for reason to their congregation why not to believe this so they basically sealed their Doom those ministers just like the Pharisees sealed their Doom when they said crucify him and the prophet raised up with a message called indictment under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and indicted those ministers for crucifying the word they pulled away they put their congregations and they had councils in every country should we receive it or not and if they said no that was rejected it was a false prophet and all those things they pulled away and revealed the Grain and the Grain in the seed is everything that was in the original and that is the full restoration of the word now that is the Holy Ghost still the same Holy Spirit but now I always like to demonstrate this yay there's a Bible here hallelujah all the other ages when the Holy Spirit came the book was still right and he would reveal a portion of himself and a portion here and a portion there and things that was to do with that age and you can read it in Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 about what he would do in those ages but there would come a time at the end where he himself would come and the book would be open and all the inheritance and everything that's in there would be extended like the scepter was extended to Esther who knows the story of Esther when she came up under that prophet's Ministry a guy who knew the heart of the king even to the point of what she should wear that's why you think oh this Prophet is so legalistic and telling you all the stuff to wear it's not legalistic it's a revelation it's a revelation of the heart of the king Hallelujah who believes that that you have received a revelation of the heart of the king through an anointed Prophet Vindicated to close you to preach a message to you so that when you appear before the king he will see himself in female form he will see his wife already never met her before and by eye and then he see either and she's just like him she smells like him she walks like him she been close Hallelujah that was that was a good Ministry and maybe he didn't understand why should I wear this funny thing and all the others all the other girls in the Harem they could use their own imagination just like the denominations what do they come up with their own ideas on how to please God very sincere right I will never take anything away from their sincerity and we cannot even unchristianize them they're just not called to this they're called to a whosoever we'll call him whosoever will let them come but there's another calling a higher calling a bride calling a bridegroom is calling to a bride a chosen before the foundation of the world predestinated with a seed in her heart to come forth Hallelujah let me just take a drink I forgot where I was it'll come back but this Pentecostal move as they pulled away revealed the grain now that grain had all the very things in it I was at Esther that's right the grain had all the the inflammation and all the life in every seed right so in the wheat there's all these seeds and in them when you plant that seed in the ground it's going to bring forth another wheat and you're so blessed when this message now it's seed again it's not Leaf it's not tassel it's not shuck it's seed and it's not that we're any better they were in Revival in their day but God wasn't finished and the whole idea is that all the people continue moving with God but the curse of denomination is this is us this is what we've got and fear comes on the people to hold the people in a still frame religion they take a photo of it that's it they put all the big things up they have theological schools to hold the people it's the whole thing but God is a being God is a supernatural being and he's never to be boxed into theological boxers he's never to be contained in our own pitiful little imaginations don't let your imagination rule your life don't let your ideas rule your life all it will lead to is death Hallelujah you know David when he brought that arkhan first he wanted to bring it to the city of David and and he wanted to make it all for himself because he heard that there was so much blessings in the house of abinadab so he went rushing ahead and maybe just maybe this was me maybe he didn't want to consult Nathaniel this time maybe he just wanted to quickly get his army together because he wanted the blessing but it was just a bit soon right and it wasn't ready but if you look at the second time he brings the ark he's already prepared a tent in Jerusalem not in the city of David in Jerusalem this time so it's the second time comes to the place that's prepared and ready and that's like us trying to make things happen trying to make this trying to preach and teach the seventh seal to fill people's knowledge and try and make it all happen and push people into the third pole it's like a third push right and the response is a legal response we've got to do this and fear comes on the people we've got to make this happen the coming of the Lord but really it's him and when you wait and when it's a season and the tent is ready this is the tent that's why we dance that's why we Shout we've got something to shout about that's why we celebrate that's why we have Pentecost and not a denomination we've got a real Pentecost we've got a real tambourine and a real drama we've got a reason to dance we've got a reason to sin we've got a reason to celebrate amen a real reason is beyond Beyond trying to make it happen Hallelujah Hallelujah so the pools I just want to explain I'm probably going to run out of time oh my so the pool there's three pools in Jesus ministry right so the first pull was the healing of the second all of the and it created a huge following right everyone loved it all the Abram was inviting and he was ahead of great time and everyone was getting healed then the second was the Discerning of the Huts when he began to tell the secrets of the hearts and begin to challenge the Pharisees and challenge the sin of the age and his popularity starts to go down but there's still an attraction and they all want to see it because they're all Amazed by it right even the Pharaoh a lot of the Pharisees and the high priests and all of the sanhedrans they were if Nicodemus came to him and said we know that you're a teacher come from God but there was still a pressure that they couldn't really receive it right but it was the second pull of his ministry it's like fishing you pull the you put the rod in little bait and you wait for the little fish and when it starts nibbling you just give it a little tug and it hooks that little fish now that causes a scattering then bigger fish come when the big fish come and the second pool then it attracts the elect the rainbow trout starts swimming what's going on what's Happening and then the third pool comes and that's the pull that the rainbow trout hello rainbow trout right so now Jesus third pull I just wanted to put that in there but the third pull of Jesus was when he began to speak the word and when he spoke the word it said that all left him and oh he said he just said it like unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you've got no life in you and all left they said this is a hard saying so the word came so strong that all the churches begin to leave ten thousand of his friends would leave him right and all the people begin to leave Jesus and he was preaching the fullness of the word and he began to share all the prophetic things and the mysteries of the Kingdom to the apostles and only the apostles remained and then he said to he even said to them he said will you go too he's not see the Lord is not afraid to test predestination to see what's inside the people and so when he begins to preach the truth the truth is what sets the people free right and it divides the light from Darkness separates the sheep from the goats all those things right and so he begins to preach the truth and he preaches these things and it causes all these people to leave him that's the third pull it hooks the Believers because Peter stood up and he said unto whom shall we go for thou has the words of eternal life so he's now recognizing that this one who God revealed to him was the Son of God the Christ the Messiah also had the words of eternal life so the word had the Holy Ghost and Seed form and he began to preach it and they would receive it and it would give them eternal life that was the third Paul attracting the elect amen same as in the prophet's Ministry in the first pull as I was with Moses so shall I be with B he said to brother Branham in the cave and said as Moses was given um two signs you shall be given two signs one your hand it will desert you know you'll be able to heal the sick so the prophet went out there and took a Ministry of healing to the World on the first pull people would come up he'd take their hand and left and left I think and it would show these things and he would it just said don't the angel of the Lord said to him don't just think what you're going to let I'll say it right so the Lord began to discern the sicknesses and things on based on his hand and the a great Healing Ministry a Revival that spearheaded the whole charismatic move everything the the modern healing Revival was spearheaded by this ministry and nothing even came even close because most of it was carnal impersonations most of it was people because as you know he the prophet began to tell everyone how it all worked and how it was happening and that caused all these other ministers to come Oral Roberts and all those people Atomic Hooks and all of them to the they were so like enthused by this they wanted it and brother Ben said look that's in the it's in the atonement go for it right so they went for it and under the inspiration of the hour they begin healing Ministries all over the world but it was really God was sending one man with a message right but first Paul was to create a big following of people and all the churches loved him then the Lord said if you be sincere under the second pull of his ministry he said if you be sincere then it will be come to pass that you'll know the very secrets of the hearts and as they come up Visions would form and you would tell them the secrets of their hearts and that happened right and the people still loved them and all of that but under that inspiration sin was being discerned as well and so the word but getting stronger and stronger and stronger as you know in the 56's up to 62 the word was getting stronger and stronger the Hebrews came and the church ages came and it was starting to Dawn right a new day was Dawning a lot light was coming up and it was starting to change oh no I just gotta drink some water Hallelujah get dry it's starting to Dawn light was coming up right the second pull of his ministry but then the the Lord spoke to the prophet and he said now it's time you guys I want you to take my church into the fullness of the word I want you to take my people turn northward as I was with Moses so shall I be with you now Pentecost and the charismatic movement at that time and it's Heyday was at cadus barnia and they were eating of the fruit of the Lamb the spies had women the ministers would go in they would take all the gifts and they would Minister the gifts of healing to the congregations but they weren't even in the Promised Land they were eating of the fruit of the promised land but not in the land now that's so close you get so far and you know what happened when Mo when Joshua's Ministry started to manifest and started to shine then and the people got angry the churches the Pentecostals started getting angry at the prophet Joshua in that time and they said oh Rara let us make a captain and return to Egypt not realizing that the coming of the Lord was just across Jordan not realizing that God had a captain on the other side he had a mighty Angel a captain with a sword waiting for them to lead them in their promised land and here they are on cater spania just having the gifts just having tongues interpretation you know all of those things you know uh prophecies and healing and they were like they were relishing around the gifts of the giver but they didn't have the giver himself and for measure they had his gifts and they still have his gifts right you go to a Pentecostal Church you go to a charismatic church they're full of gifts they're full of Faith they can do Miracles they can do all those things raise the dead Reinhard bonkey goes to Africa I don't know he's probably I think he's died I don't know but anyway he's a great manifestations but they're still in the in the wilderness the encoder spaniel right next to the promising right close and I want to tell you if you were there if you're there you're so close yet so far so close yet so far so they were standing there and they were on that side of Jordan and you know what they said we're gonna make a cat because they were carnal they were fighting against this Prophet because they were getting tired of these things and they said we'll make a captain and we'll go back to Egypt so that they but then God called this Prophet under his third pull of his ministry now to take the people into the Promised Land now the vision of the third pool remember this he was fishing and he pulled the line and he got in trouble by the angel of the Lord for pulling too hard and then and and the Lord said don't teach these ministers all these things this stuff is not to be taught but anyway brother Branham on the second pull he starts explaining all to the ministers and all Tommy Hicks and all of that right all these ministers in the charismatic movement and everything at all where their Founders were he was teaching them all about and he would explain it because he he he just likes to explain everything right he wants everyone to know he wants everyone to get saved so bad he said that he just can't hold it back he just wants to share it all but you watch Jesus himself never shared all those things he never said anything about how the spirit works and what happened before the found before the world ever began but a prophet who could see the same things as Jesus because he had that same Messianic gift in his life to discern the hearts the word was in him right like what the logos word was in him like it was in Christ and it was in this Prophet to do the same things to show the sign of the Messiah right It's The Sign of the Messiah and and he could see all those things but the prophet now was explaining it to everyone and they all started impersonating it and doing it and that's what this big huge movement and the Angela said I told you do not tell them all these things and he was all tangled in the line right and he's crying he said Lord forgive your poor stupid servant or whatever he said no no that's why he said I'm not saying that just to make that clear now and then he said and then and then he said all of a sudden I was lifted way up he said way up something bigger and greater was now gonna pull him into a higher vision right and so the prophet got lifted way up way out of this thing all of that age all that Wilderness all of that primordial soup of religion way out of it and up into a big room and the angel of the Lord the pillar of fire went over to this brown box and the people walked into that brown box and they came out healed right and the angel of the Lord said to brother Branham I this is the third pull and it's not a public show right and I'll meet you in there and I know you've heard this right I'm just doing this as a little Foundation because we're going to hit something in a minute but um and and so and and the prophet says I don't understand what do you mean I'll meet you in there you know like because this is like as he and he's like this is the third pool how does this work and the prophet even thought that there would be a tent Ministry and all that sort of stuff right because he was kind of figuring it out but not realizing that now it's going to go beyond it's going to become a personal visitation of the Lord himself in a wooden box hello wooden boxes moving tents right Beyond Doctrine beyond all these funny ideas of man beyond it all Beyond preaching about it and I'm sorry I'm kind of preaching about it but it's I'm trying to say look it's not just knowledge it's like look open your heart and say Lord I want that if this is what's going to bring Rapture and faith in my life Lord manifest it Lord meet me in there meet me in here God wants to meet you in here and sometimes I think to myself look when I'm praying I'm looking up and looking down and and actually isn't it and I'm like how do I look in here oh my but he's in there and so one of the greatest events in history the coming of the Lord the second coming is already happening in side hearts the greatest measure of the Holy Ghost that's ever been given to the churches ever been given to anyone even in the Old Testament they are externally worshiped and I love this if David could have such an a a joy and a dance before the Lord and he wasn't even in him he was dancing around and the Lord dancing with him around this Ark and he was rejoicing and dancing and he wasn't even inside him how much more us who has the the very King the very God Of Heaven and you how much more you don't have to go to some tent or some Temple you are the temple and you can dance right and I was dancing in Africa and I was like having it I was just like man and I was running around and dancing and I was like you know what it doesn't matter if I'm here at home at work at school the coming of the Lord is in me and I got something to dance about I got something to celebrate amen Hallelujah you got something to celebrate and if the coming of the Lord hasn't happened in you there ain't going to be no Rapture for you you're going to go on to the Great Tribulation and what you have to give there is far more on a physical level you're going to have to be murdered and tortured for your faith who would rather I just want to give you a you can tick any box do you take to give your life now or to be tortured who wants to give their life now hey man I'm not putting fear on you or anything I'm just saying this is just the two choices because if you really you know this is serious you know if if we if you just keep your own ideas and keep your own religion and keep your own past historical God but it's just ideas and just Supernatural things but not really the person then it's going to be that it's going to be tribulation and let me tell you God has his people going into tribulation too now it's not as elect bride but it's he's still Preparing People for that because that's where they're called to that's true there are people and I you know at first I thought I'll make this just all false prophecies and they're just having an enthusiastic time and they're having prophecies in the charismatic churches and then Pentecost and all of the other whatever ecommunical things that's going on prepare for the tribulation thus serve the Lord get all your stores ready right and I used to think man let's just enthusiasm or whatever and they're just caught up in their own you know they're all very majoring on on all the conspiracy theories and Trump this and everything there and I get videos from all of them and I just don't watch it all because it just gets a bit monotonous but they are truly preparing for that and they will give their life for that and they will appear before the great white Throne judgment on the wrong side of the bar and we will be there on this side of the bar and they will give an account for when you witness to them when you shared the message to them when you gave them Front Page News you know what I'm telling you tonight is Front Page News it's not all that front page news it's a backdrop this is front page news for the kingdom of God the coming of the Lord is at hand the wife has made herself ready the bride has clothed in his righteousness she was like Esther she started off as a orphan didn't know who all those things right and just in a matter of a life sad and all of a sudden within her was to be Queen and who was to be have a have half of the Kingdom have a sector extended towards her to stand there and challenge the very Devil Himself and bring him to his demise and to come under the very leadership of a Nation right it's like you that's like you Hallelujah hey man you got something to dance about you've got something to celebrate about you've got something to have a good old-fashioned Pentecostal meeting about and don't be ashamed of rejoicing don't be ashamed of shouting don't be ashamed of dancing before your Lord because wherever you go he's inside here the greatest measure of the Holy Ghost that's ever been given it was it's come to you said and the book's not closed there's no limitations right it's Unlimited Unlimited he's not holding anything back he's given all of himself and he's saying just Esther my sister's extended my SEPTA's extended Esther it's time you've been called for such a time as this for such a time as this young people I'm getting something now for the young people and I said this in Africa but it just comes in I've got to say there are five-year-olds that are going to be in a rapture there are 10 year olds that are going to be in the rapture there are all of these different ages right now you children are a witness and some of your friends that you'll be in connecting with are going to go on the rapture and you're the ones that are going to speak to them about this message you're the ones that's going to tell them the coming of the Lord is at hand and it might not just be by your mouth it'll be by your life that's why when you go out into the school when you go out into the world do not do what they do don't so easily compromise and become a movie lover and a and a lover of sin just to be cool with those cool girls that are all pretty and nice and they can do anything they want whether they're denominational whether they're in the world estas look young you know whatever some of your friends may be the ones that the Lord wants to change and they'll be ten when they get changed they'll be 12 when they get changed they'll be 15 when they get changed so you teenagers you're not too young to be a witness so wherever you're at be a real man be a real lady be a real witness and don't be ashamed because what you have can take them from Hell To Heaven just think about it I pray Lord and I want you to pray this Lord help me to be that witness help me to see that burden help me to be connected to the heart of God for these things because if you're not then what you're doing you try and you hear these things and then you go to school in the first while it's all right but then you just forget about it but if God reveals it to you and he reveals the the glory that's inside you yeah and the and and the burden of his heart to see people redeemed and you know you begin to see Heavenly things and you begin to feel his spirit in your life because you're not willing to compromise amen there are young people that are going to get changed Hallelujah and I know you know and they've got to come in so let's go witness let's go tell amen the world Hallelujah God will lead you you know we're in an age where it's so thinning out who believes it's thinning out you know like the the the numbers and the masses it's not masses it's here and here are little ones here and there but there's still ones out there and if you pray you know when we when we were early on and we were still having prayer meetings at brother Ben's place we started praying Lord lead us to the elect seed and he did he did right he led us to all of a sudden Divine appointments started happening and I just pray if we can revive that prayer I just want you to pray that like in your in your house and in prayer meeting Lord lead us to your children because you know this is this is the age where you need that kind of this specific Divine appointments we're in Auckland we're down in Dunedin and we're in different places and and God can actually if you're willing to do something for him he'll put people around you and you they will always be accredited to your witness for eternity there'll be a special connection between you and those people that you witnessed to because you weren't ashamed and you know what shame comes from fear fear of rejection but look the Lord is here to heal that if anyone wants to be healed from fear of rejection he's here to do that and that's the very thing that stops us from witnessing to people that or the fear of upsetting people you know because you taught in this country I mean in Africa you can talk to anyone about the Lord and they all love the Lord and everyone you know we were witnessing to everyone and they were all taken books and they were I mean brother Ben LED people to the Lord outside someone's house you know it was like Hey praise the Lord everywhere we win there was people asking a prayer I felt like man why can't New Zealand just be warm you know these people when I go out there you even start talking about the Lord and you know we were in places public areas and you're talking about the Lord and people give you dirty looks as if like you know this is a filthy thing this is ah this is New Zealand though you know the only new Zeals in the in the church hello who's got new Zeal Hallelujah we got new Zeal you know why because you got something to worship You've Got Something to Dance about Hallelujah how much time have I got I got six minutes okay so the Ark of the Lord right huh help me Lord this has got to be quick and I'm not going to preach anyway I'm just going to tell you Glory amen so the Ark of the Lord came down under Moses Ministry you know a prophet's Ministry he went he got taken in a vision he saw a heavenly vision of how The Mercy Seat was and the angels guarding The Mercy Seat but the key was in the middle was Christ the throne and he was standing there and and God said now build this and so Moses now and the ministry of bezeliel and a few others were anointed in their giftings it actually brought that heavenly vision down into the wilderness so it brought the presence of God and the in a symbol of Heaven down and a portion in God's anointed fire came down into the holy of holies in the wilderness we always think the Wilderness there's no God there and you're just out of his will you're not if you're in the wilderness you're still walking with God it's taking you through stuff but you're gonna come into the land you're coming into the land I said I wasn't going to preach but you don't ever think you know people say you're in the wilderness and I've said that earlier and some people might get offended ah you say I'm out of no God's there he's taking you there he said I took you out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings to myself not to The Emptiness but the emptiness in the desert places and the trials was to prove what's in you it's to bring you to a place where you say Lord I am nothing and I need you and I depend on you and I'm surrendering everything so you can live so that you can be the preeminent King in my life not me I can't do it you can't do it none of us can the Wilderness is for a reason it's so that you can give up on yourself and let God come in don't give up and do nothing give up on yourself so God can come in Everything Changes then but let's say now this art comes down into the Wilderness and they have it in the holy of holies they're in the tense of congregation right Tabernacle the outer Court the inner Court in the holy of holies Body Spirit Soul rights and intent and it's moving through the wilderness the ark is a type of the seventh seal which is bringing Christ to the Earth so a portion of God's revelation in heaven was on Earth and it now every time the pillar of fire moved and the cloud moved they moved with it they as I said I've preached it already they came up to the Jordan and the whole church you could say was with them under the prophets Ministry a lot of them said let us turn back to Egypt here many times but there was a true elect and they came under the prophets Ministry the ark came the seventh seal and it came up to the River Jordan it stopped the flow and they went across right now the ark's still there for some people and it's waiting for you to come across he's waiting for you to die to yourself he's waiting for you to surrender your life he's waiting for you to die to all that you think you are so that he can reveal who you really are and come into the land now Israel crossed over Jordan the captain came down but the ark seventh seal the very presence of God was put in Shiloh stayed in Charlotte for a long time four or five hundred years Silo is tranquil silence so here is that great seventh seal coming down and it gets placed in silence and it sits there at the back not in Jerusalem where it should be right it should be in the heart or it should be right where it's all happening right in the center where God should be on the throne but it's actually in Shiloh right now that's Israel and they come and the Ark stays there and then Joshua's Ministry and they do great things and God fulfills his word he promises all these things right and he does it and it says it says all that was promised Moses and all that was said under Joshua the Lord has given all is theirs all is fulfilled right and those that really believe that like Caleb he said give me my mountain and he got his mountain and there was others that didn't get theirs and they cried and whatever and they get all what their things right but Caleb got it it's an individual thing even though it was like a national thing it was still individual those people Dan and all this occur and all those tribes they had families in those tribes it was those families that needed to claim their land find your redempt find your scriptures find your inheritance and claim it don't rely on us there's no point having a collective idea we're all going to have a Revival you need a Revival you need to claim your scriptures you need to get your land because when you get your land you can grow stuff you know that when you get your land there's fruit when you get your land your children getting saved your children are getting all those things because they're getting their land because now you can pass the inheritance down through the father's name right it's all the anointing of God when you claim it don't wait for the church because you'll be waiting forever it's you right Caleb was him said yes I'm taking my land so he took his land right now I just wanted to say that but so they went through but Joshua died off the generations so they went into sin the people of the message right people of the message they had a prophet's message they went into the time of judges and it was real bad eighth angels all these different Prophets two souls in the Millennium already you name it you know and then fighting Politics the Books open the books closed everything's everywhere no real headship but yet there was a roof yet there was Revival yet there was the seed and I believe I'm looking at people that are of that caliber that have taken it through right and then it came to the end you know and the ark's still in Shiloh still in Silence the seventh seal that was to bring the people to speak bit like Joshua he spoke the prophet he spoke in sunsood story controlled nature spoke storm be gone and sunshine for four days squirrel you come from there you come from there right that Ministry had that spoken word but it's like but when he was gone Joshua was gone late in silence then all of a sudden here comes the time of judges and sin the devil starts to try and destroy the message and as we know if you've been around long enough you've seen the history but Hannah Rises up God chooses Hannah she doesn't really know how major her thing is right she doesn't know how major her calling really is in this woman 60 odd years old Baron tortured in Her Mind by panina all those years created a pearl in her life penina means Pearl and a pearl formed in her life and she raises up with faith and a desperation I must bring forth life life comes forth from Hannah and that life was a prophet the prophet said because she was unselfish God gave a prophet and it was that prophetic Ministry that began Revival in the whole nation so a woman and I tell you now Hennis I know henna's here but there's ant Hannah but there's real we're all Hannah's amen where we have been sick and tired of politics we've been sick and tired of the past and all this headless chickens I shouldn't say that but like just that whole political realm right and all the stuff and doctrines and this isn't fulfilled in there no it's an event not a Doctrine right and Hannah realize it's an event life is coming forth and that life brought forth for David right and David now and this is David is a type of Christ in you Christ in you because David was a human being and yet he was the type of Christ and when Christ is in you you still make some mistakes but Christ is in you it's the hope of glory and and and when you anoint him King when life when you're falling or do not falling when you've shunned all the past and all the politics and all the he said she said trying to be the best trying to be the best girl trying to be the best boy trying to be the toughest or the strongest or the nicest or the coolest and all those emulations and all that competition's gone and all the politics is gone and all you care about is him and all you want to do is exalt his name and and and and the love of God right amen and you want life to come for that's the life that's the life that anoints him can not I try to be this I am Prius proper I know everything in the message I am the best those days is finished that's time a judge's days it's time to judge's time if you want David King forsake those things and let him rise because David was the very time that they got all their inheritance it was under David's Ministry that all the inheritance came to Israel now the Philistines really got beat and the malachite's really got beat everything really got beat hey it actually was total Deliverance under David right and that's the same thing all in your land because the kingdom of God is within you and if you want real total Deliverance they totally all of everything out and you want to get all of what's belongs to you that's already in you unlocked get all the squatters of of of malice out of you and the squatters of of unforgiveness out of you and the splatters of racistness out of you in the in the squatters of whatever it is right you know what's going on in your own life lust fear all those things if you want them out then let your life anoint David King you've had it here guys told you what your what the life is now it's time for you to recognize that you need it that's the Wilderness and you say Lord oh it is I'm done Lord here I am I nothing in my hands I bring simply to your cross I cling when all around my soldier's way he's All My Hope and stay and you know and he begins to come down into your life and change everything change your operating system change it from dos 3.1 to whatever the new one is hallelujah you know it's real hard doing anything on those old operating systems and that's like what you were before the New Birth oh my all these things to try and get one thing to work and it didn't work and then you put that disc in that didn't work and yeah and you just forget it oh my I don't know if anyone's been through that but I remember the 90s and computers was just a stressful thing that's what our old life is that's what the old nature is stressful always failing Saul could never truly deliver the people even though he was fighting all the time and you may be fighting all the time but the seven seal was in silence and that's the one that needs to come out of that position anyway David becomes king right and when David becomes king he finally brings the ark see that when I saw that I thought man what significance that in my own life when David is made King you know and David's exalted as king and he begins to deliver all these things into my hands and all my inheritance becomes a unlocked because remember when you've got the Holy Ghost everything is already in you all your inheritance is in you all the potentials is in you and you've just got to feed on the word and let them take out all those bitterness things take out all the pus all right but then it comes a time where David becomes king he's becomes preeminence because that was one of the great things that he desired under the threefold manifestation right was that he would reveal himself then he would have preeminence in his bride then he would take her the male and the female Back to Eden again and have a have a millennium that the devil interrupted so you know that right I'm talking higher level now but he so that preeminence in the bride starts with you you need to let them have preeminence in you now when David gets preeminence in you the first thing he's going to do is take the ark that was sitting in silence in your Shiloh and he's going to bring it out of silence and it's going to bring it into a into your heart and right into your very place of spoken word and you are going to begin to speak the word and life is going to come forth and you're going to get control over nature you're going to get control over all the elements of the Earth But first you need an anoint him King so that he can give you dominion over the elements of this first flesh because this flesh if you let it rule it says in Romans 6 let not sin reign in your mortal body to obey it in the lust thereof because if you do and you're still struggling with that then how can he give you creative power unlock it in your life if then you unlock it you'll be like the prophet Elias Elisha who cursed those beers curse those children they all died that he only had a portion of the creative power in him as a prophet God's giving you way more than that way more like it's unlimited he's not giving you less than what he's got because you're his wife right on top of the Kingdom the sentence extended everything's open right so now when he can see that you've got dominion over the elements what he has in you then he'll call the spoken word out of Silence now when David saw that happening you know he was dancing and shouting and he was so happy why was he so happy because he saw more than the others saw he saw more than McCall saw he saw more than Joe absor he saw more than his son saw he saw more and I believe that as that Ark was coming up he was dancing and leaping it said and amen and McCall was looking at him and despising him don't let McCall pull you down from worship don't let macaw look through your windows right now looking through just stay still deceit let's be nice and calm you're European you know we don't get too excited here we don't dance we don't leap even though the coming of the Lord is in my heart I'm just going to sit down amen did anyone see no you should be dancing and shouting Hallelujah yeah Glory I'm dancing and you know David had a secret weapon when he got in trouble you look every Psalm came from trouble why because he he realized something he had a secret weapon and I want to just arm you you're dangerous now you've got a secret weapon when all the trouble comes on you I want you to recognize inside me is the coming of the Lord and I'm gonna dance and I'm gonna encourage myself in the Lord when it's hard when I'm going through trials when I'm on the ground under failure when I make mistakes when everyone's against me when I've lost everything we all go through these things right hey man let's hit the musicians we all go through it but amen when you go through it remember you're armed and dangerous because when you begin to encourage yourself in the Lord when you begin to encourage yourself in the Lord then it all changes then you encourage yourself in the Lord begin to dance you might not want to dance in front of other people you might not dance very good but sometimes you just gotta you know McCall said to David how great was the King today who shamelessly uncovered himself and I thought Glory let me unashamed to uncover Who I Really Am you know who I really am and who you really are you are sons of God that shouted together and sung for Joy before the world began who knows the story George God said to Job where were you and I when the sons of God shouted together and the morning star sang now if you they shouted right so if your origin is shouting then it's time to be unashamed to uncover who that really is and then you know when we say the seals are open it's not just him open it's you open and when the seals open in your life it reveals who you really are Debbie reveals Who You Are and it's a good thing and sometimes we're embarrassed about who we really are and we're only like that in front of our home and our parents right young people you show on something nice at school and you be real good in that church you're real good at that Homer you know like just be yourself and if you're ashamed of any part of you if you're open about it God will change that he will he's in the process of restoring our lives and changing us amen Hallelujah can I just sing the song all weekend I don't want to sing it by myself um oh I must have deleted it it's manifesting time who believes it's manifesting time Hallelujah give me some choppy beets I want some choppy beets we've got something to celebrate who believes we got something to celebrate Hallelujah maybe I've said some things that are a bit mysterious for some but I believe it's personal and I hope it isn't still mysterious I hope and I believe I just trust the Lord that he will make it personal and it will become an experience not a teacher get me some beats the turbo I can't hear you okay give me some piano can we have some fall back here [Music] I think I'm used to Africans volume it feels like there's no music but is there any music playing can anyone hear music I think I've been um what do you call that I've been spoiled by volume the Africans know exactly what I'm talking about you when they play music you can't even hear yourself talk or sing or think or pray you just all you do is you just move with the beat you
