[51:20] next wednesday or sunday or something
[51:22] but
[51:23] you know we we need to have a time where

[52:14] verse 54 here then we're going to go to
[52:16] romans chapter 11. i'm going to read one
[52:18] verse from there so he's so this is
[52:21] eliezer he's speaking to rebecca's
[52:23] family he's giving the report of um of
[52:26] of him being commissioned and seen to
[52:27] find a a bride for isaac
[52:30] abraham's son and he said i am abraham's
[52:32] servant and the lord hath blessed my
[52:34] master greatly and he has become great
[52:36] and he hath given him flocks and herds
[52:39] and silver and gold and manservants and
[52:41] maidservants and camels and asses and
[52:43] sarah my master's wife bear a son to my
[52:45] master when she was old and unto him
[52:48] hath he given all that he hath and my
[52:50] master made me swear saying thou shall
[52:52] not take a wife to my son of the
[52:54] daughters of the canaanites in whose
[52:56] land i dwell but thou shalt go into my
[52:59] father's house and to my kindred and
[53:01] take a wife unto my son and i said unto
[53:03] my master pre-adventure the woman will
[53:05] not follow me and he said unto me the
[53:07] lord before whom i walk will send his
[53:10] angel before thee and prosper thy way
[53:12] and thou shalt take a wife for my son of
[53:14] my kindred of my father's house then
[53:17] shall thou
[53:18] be clear from this uh my oath when thou
[53:21] cometh to my kindred and if they give
[53:24] not thee one thou shall be clear from my
[53:27] oath and i came this day into the well i
[53:30] said o lord god of my master abraham if
[53:33] now thou
[53:34] do prosper my way which i go behold i
[53:37] stand by the well of water and it shall
[53:39] come to pass that when the virgin cometh
[53:41] forth to drink water and i say to her
[53:43] give me i pray thee a little water of a
[53:46] picture to drink and she say to me both
[53:48] drink thou and i will also draw for thy
[53:51] camels let the same be the woman whom
[53:53] the lord hath appointed to um out for my
[53:56] master's son and before i have done
[53:58] speaking in my heart behold rebecca came
[54:00] forth with her picture on her shoulder
[54:03] and she came down into the well and drew
[54:04] water and i said unto her let me drink i
[54:07] pray thee and she made haste and let
[54:09] down her picture from her shoulder and
[54:11] said drink and i'll give thy camel's
[54:13] drink also so i drank and she made the
[54:15] camel's drink also and i asked her and
[54:18] said whose daughter are thou
[54:20] and she said the daughter of bethul
[54:26] unto him and i put the earring upon her
[54:28] face and bracelets upon her hands and i
[54:31] bowed down my head and worshiped the
[54:32] lord and please and bless the lord god
[54:35] of my master abraham which had led me in
[54:37] the right way to take my master's
[54:39] brother's daughter under his son and now
[54:42] if ye will deal kindly and truly with my
[54:44] master tell me and if not tell me that i
[54:47] might turn to the right hand or to the
[54:49] left and lebanon bethel answered and
[54:51] said the thing proceedeth from the lord
[54:53] we cannot speak unto thee good or bad
[54:55] behold rebecca is before thee take her
[54:57] and go and let her be thy master's son's
[55:00] wife as the lord has spoken and it came
[55:02] to pass that when abraham's servant
[55:04] heard their words he worshipped the lord
[55:06] bowing himself to the earth and the
[55:08] servant brought forth
[55:10] jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
[55:12] raymond and gave them to rebecca and he
[55:15] gave also to her brother and to her
[55:17] mother precious things and they did eat
[55:19] and drink he and the men that were with
[55:21] him and carried all night they rose up
[55:23] in the morning and he said send me away
[55:26] unto my master and then one verse just a
[55:29] bit of a context romans 11 and 29
[55:32] here
[55:36] amen so we go to romans 11 and 29 it
[55:38] says this i'm trust this is a familiar
[55:41] uh verse to
[55:42] to us all very foundational he says for
[55:45] the gifts for the gifts plural gifts and
[55:48] calling one calling of god are without
[55:51] repentance i mean may the lord bless his
[55:53] word you may have your seats this
[55:55] morning so i'd like to speak about
[55:58] the uh gift
[56:01] in and without the body of christ
[56:04] there's a difference between having
[56:05] gifts
[56:07] and being in the body of christ by the
[56:08] baptism of the holy ghost and having
[56:10] gifts outside the body now i'm not going
[56:12] to talk about your spiritual gifts where
[56:14] where where the prophet told us that
[56:16] that gift could just fall upon someone
[56:18] use them once and then move on i'm not
[56:19] talking about i'm talking about gifts
[56:20] that you're born with now notice that we
[56:22] read there in romans now we're going to
[56:24] get to rebecca we're going to kind of do
[56:25] a big big detour and get back there but
[56:28] you know we read there in in in romans
[56:30] 11 said no says for the gifts of
[56:32] multiple gifts and calling one calling
[56:34] of god or without repentance now that
[56:36] means before a person ever repents the
[56:38] gifts and calling of god are there
[56:40] right so they're without repentance you
[56:42] don't get those things by repenting but
[56:43] they're actually there before a person
[56:45] repents now a gift that people are born
[56:48] with gifts right people are born with
[56:50] gifts and and we'll go into it but you
[56:52] can see in the world that there's very
[56:53] gifted people it's not a shock to tell
[56:55] you that there's gifted people and
[56:56] they're not just christian people they
[56:58] are anything people very gifted people
[57:00] but but the prophet of god says this in
[57:02] the deep calls to the deep he says now
[57:04] seeing visions is justice so he's
[57:06] speaking of his own ministry now he's
[57:08] seeing visions is just as common to me
[57:10] as it would be for you to get hungry
[57:12] it's a nature and that's where the
[57:14] churches fail today in many i say it
[57:16] with reverence brother and sister that
[57:17] when we try to do something that we are
[57:19] not we can't make you can't make your
[57:21] eyes blue when they're brown
[57:23] uh who can add a thought
[57:25] who by taking thought can add one cubit
[57:27] to his stature gifts and callings are
[57:29] without repentance people are born to be
[57:31] singers
[57:32] some time ago i was buying my little
[57:34] girl a little piano for christmas she
[57:36] seemed like inclined to be that way
[57:38] me and my wife cannot play either and i
[57:40] was trying to pick out a court on the
[57:41] little thing and a little boy came up
[57:43] about eight years old little shoes on
[57:45] his feet little here needed trimming
[57:47] very bad it was down to his shoulders
[57:49] old raggedy coat he stood and looked at
[57:51] me a little bit
[57:52] and he said what are you trying to do
[57:53] mister i said i'm trying to make this
[57:55] chord so he's trying to play the piano
[57:57] he says let me have it i thought well
[57:58] what would this poor little ignorant
[58:00] child know about playing the piano oh my
[58:03] he was a master with it he was playing
[58:04] anything he wanted to well i looked at
[58:06] him he walked over to one of those
[58:08] little xylophones he picked it up and
[58:09] played it silent night i never heard
[58:11] anything like it
[58:13] and then took about a six or eight inch
[58:15] piece of gas pipe laying there in the
[58:17] hardware store and blowed the star stars
[58:19] spangled banner through that gas pipe i
[58:21] said son did you ever have a music
[58:23] lesson and then he said what's that see
[58:26] he was born a musician it was just a
[58:28] gift to know how to do it it's like
[58:31] tuning that instrument the piano
[58:32] whatever it could be as far as it making
[58:34] a noise it'd be all right to me but the
[58:36] master knows just how to tighten the
[58:38] string there's something in them tells
[58:39] them that that's the way gifts are
[58:41] they're just natural to see a vision
[58:43] doesn't make you well is to help you it
[58:45] helps set the church in its place so
[58:47] he's saying that that little boy was was
[58:50] born to be a musician and when we can
[58:51] see it in our midst you know i could
[58:53] never play any of these instruments like
[58:55] us among us who are gifted you know to
[58:58] do so i could never do it even with all
[59:00] the training the best tutors they could
[59:01] even try and teach me themselves and i
[59:03] think i just end up being frustrated
[59:05] because i don't have it within me the
[59:07] gift i was not born though it could be
[59:09] trained i could be trained to a certain
[59:10] level i'm not gifted in that way so but
[59:13] those kind of gifts come before a person
[59:15] ever repents that they're already laying
[59:17] within them
[59:18] amen so you know brother brown says here
[59:21] he says i've saw visions for 40
[59:23] something years and it never has failed
[59:25] i saw visions when i was a sinner why it
[59:27] was a gift first vision i ever remember
[59:30] my mama told me of me speaking it to her
[59:32] when i wasn't quite two years old he
[59:34] says
[59:35] you know he said he heard a voice victim
[59:37] said they're going to move and live near
[59:38] a place called new albany and then
[59:41] shortly after that they moved to that
[59:42] place you know you know you know his
[59:44] mother was shocked by that he you know i
[59:46] said you know you're born that way it's
[59:48] a trait that's in you just like you're
[59:49] born with blue eyes or black eyes or
[59:51] brown eyes or what it's something god
[59:53] has done it's just it's the only way it
[59:55] can correctly be it has to come from god
[59:57] not something you made it's what god has
[59:59] ordained to be
[1:00:00] then if it's of god um then it's of god
[1:00:03] if you're just bluffing and make it up
[1:00:04] you're see you're wrong see so it's
[1:00:07] something that we're born with you can't
[1:00:08] help it it's just something that begins
[1:00:10] to express within you someone who wants
[1:00:12] to play music they just attracted
[1:00:13] towards music they can't help it right
[1:00:15] it's just something that's within them
[1:00:16] they are pre gifts are predestinated of
[1:00:19] god
[1:00:20] and this is to every every human being
[1:00:23] it's this is not just the believers this
[1:00:25] is to everyone on the earth there are
[1:00:26] gifted people because they're born
[1:00:29] you know that way you're just born with
[1:00:31] it it's without repentance now
[1:00:34] you know so this is not a shock when i
[1:00:35] say that there's very gifted people in
[1:00:37] the world you know these very gifted
[1:00:38] musicians singers motivational speakers
[1:00:41] you know people who can make people
[1:00:42] laugh because remember a merry heart
[1:00:44] does good like a medicine that's
[1:00:46] actually a gift now what the person does
[1:00:48] with that gift can be a very different
[1:00:49] thing but they but they're placed in the
[1:00:51] person's life and they'll be will be
[1:00:53] held accountable because they're all
[1:00:54] gifted we're all gifted people right
[1:00:56] we're all gifted but we'll be how to
[1:00:58] count by how we use that gift who we
[1:01:00] surrender it to rather if we surrender
[1:01:02] it to god it will further god's work
[1:01:04] further god's kingdom but if we
[1:01:06] surrender it to the devil well it will
[1:01:08] further his kingdom right so a gift can
[1:01:10] either bring heaven down or bring hell
[1:01:12] up amen it depends who we surrender it
[1:01:14] to so you know just like people who have
[1:01:17] very gifted your motivational speakers
[1:01:19] they could you know if that was really a
[1:01:21] a real to me that's a preaching gift now
[1:01:24] we know that someone can be very
[1:01:26] charismatic and just because people can
[1:01:28] talk till the cows come home it doesn't
[1:01:30] make them a preacher but right there but
[1:01:32] there's a gift within that people can
[1:01:33] speak it charisma
[1:01:35] now many great gifts that are in the
[1:01:37] land today actually started off in
[1:01:38] church
[1:01:39] they started off in in in in christian
[1:01:42] circles
[1:01:43] but then they sold their gift for fame
[1:01:46] because the devil will try and buy you
[1:01:49] it depends the value he puts on you but
[1:01:51] he'll try and buy you a certain way so
[1:01:53] the lord jesus he put the highest value
[1:01:55] he could put on him said i'll give you
[1:01:56] all the kingdoms of the world if you bow
[1:01:58] down and worship me now he may not put
[1:02:00] that value upon you but he'll try and
[1:02:02] give you a little kingdom a little
[1:02:03] influence among some people it'll sway
[1:02:05] among friends or a little popularity he
[1:02:08] will he'll try and give that to you
[1:02:10] based on the estimation of of of your
[1:02:13] value to him
[1:02:14] but you've got to come to a place where
[1:02:16] you can't be bought because jesus has
[1:02:18] already bought you i've already been
[1:02:19] purchased i'm not for sale i've already
[1:02:21] been sold i've been bought by the blood
[1:02:22] of jesus christ i mean i cannot be
[1:02:24] bought amen
[1:02:26] that's that's that's how we should be
[1:02:28] hallelujah amen it says in james 1 and
[1:02:31] 17 sorry i'm tally i'm gonna if you
[1:02:34] could just
[1:02:35] throw these up quick um in james 1 and
[1:02:37] 17 it says this here maybe i'll just
[1:02:39] start and if you get there well yeah um
[1:02:42] it says that every good gift if you oh
[1:02:44] here we go she's quick on the trigger
[1:02:45] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:02:47] is from above and cometh down from the
[1:02:49] father of lights with whom is no
[1:02:51] variableness neither shadow of turning
[1:02:53] so james is saying every good gift and
[1:02:55] every perfect gift is from above
[1:02:57] now i'll say every gift is actually a
[1:02:59] good gift
[1:03:00] that's how it's used every gift is good
[1:03:03] but it's how it's used that's why i said
[1:03:04] it depends what you surrender it who you
[1:03:06] surrender it to if it will be used for
[1:03:08] good or for evil but that's up to you
[1:03:10] because it's placed within your hand i
[1:03:12] mean every good gift and perfect gift is
[1:03:14] from above romans 12 and 3
[1:03:18] it says is here because you know
[1:03:20] everyone has a measure of faith
[1:03:22] even an atheist actually has a faith
[1:03:25] because when you talk to them and and
[1:03:27] and i've talked to quite a few you know
[1:03:28] as everyone knows i
[1:03:31] i work in the science field at a
[1:03:32] biochemistry at university i was there
[1:03:34] too long to postgraduate study all those
[1:03:36] things but you know even even the the
[1:03:39] laws of basic chemistry actually stop
[1:03:41] evolution from happening down this is
[1:03:43] before life you know the prebiotic life
[1:03:45] whatever it's called you know but but
[1:03:47] the thing is an atheist will actually
[1:03:48] believe no with enough time it will
[1:03:50] happen
[1:03:51] they say no no if you put enough time
[1:03:53] into the equation then life will begin
[1:03:55] evolution will happen so what they're
[1:03:56] basically saying because they cannot
[1:03:58] prove it is they believe that
[1:03:59] so everyone has a measure of faith right
[1:04:02] and do we have that romans 12 and 3 for
[1:04:04] i say
[1:04:06] through the grace given unto me to every
[1:04:08] man that is among you not to think of
[1:04:09] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:04:11] think but who think soberly according as
[1:04:14] god hath dwelt to every man
[1:04:16] the measure of faith
[1:04:18] so every man has been given a measure of
[1:04:20] faith doesn't matter if they're believer
[1:04:21] unbeliever everyone even the devils
[1:04:23] believe in tremble but the faith they
[1:04:25] have is not a revelation faith it's an
[1:04:27] intellectual faith otherwise they'd be
[1:04:29] saved because they believe
[1:04:31] right but we'll get into that in a in a
[1:04:34] future service so everyone has been
[1:04:36] given a measure of faith i say faith is
[1:04:38] a gift of god
[1:04:40] so we all fall into these brackets right
[1:04:42] so you know if we look into
[1:04:46] let's just stay in the realm of the arts
[1:04:48] i think this is quite interesting how
[1:04:50] brother isaac preached on god being the
[1:04:51] great director and and already had these
[1:04:53] notes before he preached it but it's
[1:04:55] just a bit of a continuation i just yeah
[1:04:57] it just blessed me saying thank you lord
[1:04:59] it's not just me rattling around in my
[1:05:00] little mind trying to conjure something
[1:05:02] up so let's just stay in the realm of
[1:05:04] the arts you know it is
[1:05:06] um
[1:05:07] you know to be able to sing if you think
[1:05:09] you're just the gift of a singer that's
[1:05:11] a good gift
[1:05:13] to be able to play an instrument that's
[1:05:14] a good gift
[1:05:16] to be a an incredible artist that's a
[1:05:18] good gift because god's an art gods and
[1:05:20] music the right kind to be an author to
[1:05:23] be a gifted author that's a good gift
[1:05:26] right to be a storyteller someone who
[1:05:27] can make films incredible gift
[1:05:30] amen being able to make someone laugh
[1:05:34] is is a good gift a merry heart does
[1:05:36] good like a medicine he said i'm not
[1:05:38] very gifted but if you can create an
[1:05:39] atmosphere where people people come to
[1:05:41] you or burden but they leave all light
[1:05:42] and happy you know what that's a gift
[1:05:46] that's a gift amen to create an
[1:05:47] atmosphere where people actually their
[1:05:49] burdens are lifted
[1:05:51] amen just to have that kind of place you
[1:05:52] go relax that's a gift
[1:05:55] amen now all of those all of those gifts
[1:05:57] that i've just listed they are they're
[1:05:59] good
[1:06:00] but it's how they're used
[1:06:02] it's very important all gifts so so that
[1:06:05] as i said either bring heaven down or
[1:06:07] they'll bring hell up
[1:06:09] right so someone who can ride a you know
[1:06:11] there's many famous authors in the land
[1:06:13] today what if they gave that gift to to
[1:06:15] god and that god inspired that gift
[1:06:18] what would that do for the kingdom of
[1:06:20] god someone who's a great artist today
[1:06:22] what what could that do
[1:06:24] someone who can you know paint great
[1:06:26] paintings or put put put videos together
[1:06:29] whatever what if that was put in god's
[1:06:31] hands
[1:06:32] you know the multi-billion dollar
[1:06:34] industry that's hollywood what if that
[1:06:35] was put in god's hands
[1:06:37] the gospel would have gone around the
[1:06:39] world multiple times
[1:06:41] you know so because all those gifts are
[1:06:43] god-given but it's who they surrender
[1:06:45] them to that matters
[1:06:47] you know elvis presley
[1:06:49] actually he grew up in a pentecostal
[1:06:51] church
[1:06:52] and and in those days pentecost was
[1:06:54] actually a real pentecost it wasn't a
[1:06:56] put on with smoke machines and lights
[1:06:57] and different things it was actually the
[1:06:59] spirit of god was moving and brother
[1:07:01] braham even said that he knew he knew um
[1:07:04] his pastor so elvis presley's pastor was
[1:07:08] a friend of his
[1:07:09] and so how he learned to dance was
[1:07:11] actually by seeing people anointed with
[1:07:13] the spirit of god
[1:07:14] he said those dance moves were actually
[1:07:17] god it was he saw that first in church
[1:07:19] where people would dance in the spirit
[1:07:21] and rejoice but he took that gift and he
[1:07:23] was a very gifted man
[1:07:25] but he took that gift and he sold it
[1:07:27] sold it for a fleet of cadillacs
[1:07:29] where he could have used it and and and
[1:07:31] shaken the world with that kind of gift
[1:07:34] amen for the kingdom of god
[1:07:36] so he learned his his maneuvers as
[1:07:38] jerking shaking amen he
[1:07:41] he he learned it under the anointing of
[1:07:43] the spirit of god in the church now i've
[1:07:44] seen i've seen meetings
[1:07:46] and and people have been dancing and
[1:07:48] running around rejoicing in the spirit
[1:07:51] and not and
[1:07:52] it astounds me that they don't crash
[1:07:54] into each other but to me it's just god
[1:07:56] doing it and then i saw that i thought
[1:07:58] you know what you know what so that what
[1:08:00] that is
[1:08:01] on the devil's side is a mosh pit
[1:08:04] at a concert so so he takes a genuine
[1:08:06] and perverts it and makes it that but
[1:08:09] the genuine we had the genuine first
[1:08:11] amen so you see people jumping shouting
[1:08:14] rejoicing you say that looks like a mosh
[1:08:15] pit to me but it's not unclean it's not
[1:08:18] filthy there's no perversion because the
[1:08:19] spirit causing it to happen is god
[1:08:21] amen so we can never ever you know
[1:08:24] if we're inspired to dance dance
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:29] god made dancing
[1:08:31] the devil's perverted it to what it is
[1:08:33] today but god made dancing
[1:08:35] amen
[1:08:36] amen he made singing he made rejoicing
[1:08:39] he made shouting god made it the devil
[1:08:41] doesn't have claims on that he just
[1:08:42] perverts anything god has done i mean
[1:08:44] but elvis elvis we know he he he took
[1:08:47] his gift sold it to the world and you
[1:08:50] can just see how the world rapidly
[1:08:51] changed there by the demon anointing
[1:08:53] came into his life and spread out into
[1:08:55] other people's gifts changed the whole
[1:08:57] of the whole whole world
[1:08:59] by that demon power of rock and roll
[1:09:01] moving through the world change the
[1:09:02] whole place you know but this is not
[1:09:04] just unique to elvis you know you know
[1:09:07] the band you too actually started as a
[1:09:09] christian band
[1:09:11] they they were part of an evangelical
[1:09:13] christian congregation most of the band
[1:09:15] and they actually were challenged when
[1:09:17] they first started how can you do this
[1:09:18] music yet be christian so they
[1:09:21] um
[1:09:21] if i get it right they they kind of
[1:09:23] paused for about a week and thought
[1:09:25] about it then they continued on and see
[1:09:27] what they are today
[1:09:29] so they had a great gift and they
[1:09:31] started off in the church but they sold
[1:09:33] that gift to the world justin bieber
[1:09:36] started off in church apparently he's
[1:09:38] anyway but you know he took that gift
[1:09:40] look what he's done with it
[1:09:41] katy perry the same kind of thing
[1:09:44] they were raised as christian people now
[1:09:46] i'm just using the whole banner of
[1:09:47] christianity right but they but they
[1:09:49] were raised as christians
[1:09:51] but they took their gift soul to the
[1:09:52] world and look what it's done to the
[1:09:54] world
[1:09:55] so but it but to me it's astounding
[1:09:57] where people like that or any gift that
[1:09:59] actually starts in the
[1:10:01] in the realm of christendom
[1:10:02] that actually god is allowing to be used
[1:10:04] for his kingdom but then they sell the
[1:10:06] gift to the world and the devil uses it
[1:10:07] isn't it amazing that god just doesn't
[1:10:09] take that gift from them
[1:10:11] god just says no how do you use that for
[1:10:13] for my enemy i'm gonna take that from
[1:10:15] you no he doesn't do that he allows
[1:10:16] people to go right on
[1:10:19] he allows because it's part of who they
[1:10:21] are
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:23] no gift is taken from someone that that
[1:10:25] walks away from god god allows them to
[1:10:27] keep it because it's part of them
[1:10:29] you know and the same thing applies to
[1:10:31] ministry gifts people are born with them
[1:10:34] you know brother brown preached a sermon
[1:10:36] this is in the last part of his ministry
[1:10:38] he called it anointed ones at the end
[1:10:39] time
[1:10:40] and he said that that message was
[1:10:43] prophecy so he preached it back in 1965
[1:10:46] and he says he says this now i've
[1:10:47] decided or felt led by the holy spirit
[1:10:50] to speak this morning on prophecy to
[1:10:52] kind of inform us see it's something
[1:10:54] that we if we're not informed in
[1:10:55] something anything happens just casually
[1:10:58] we should know about this the holy
[1:10:59] spirit has given to us to warn the
[1:11:01] people of the comings you know the bible
[1:11:03] said that god will do nothing except he
[1:11:05] shows his servants the prophet so he's
[1:11:07] saying actually what i'm preaching is
[1:11:08] prophecy you may see it in a small form
[1:11:11] right now in 1965 because we did with
[1:11:13] the beetles and and and and elvis and
[1:11:16] different ones but now it's just spread
[1:11:18] everywhere
[1:11:19] so what it was in a baby form there is
[1:11:21] now in its mature form
[1:11:23] now
[1:11:24] and then he would take the scripture
[1:11:25] from matthew 24 24 he says for there
[1:11:27] shall arise false christs and false
[1:11:30] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:11:32] wonders and so much that as it were
[1:11:33] possible if it were possible they shall
[1:11:36] deceive the very elect now he says this
[1:11:39] jesus saying here this shall arise false
[1:11:41] christ notice it did not say there shall
[1:11:44] arise false jesus because who's going to
[1:11:46] fall for someone standing saying i'm
[1:11:48] jesus
[1:11:49] now actually around the world there are
[1:11:50] people who claim to be jesus christ in
[1:11:52] the flesh and some people have fallen
[1:11:54] for it but the vast majority say no i'm
[1:11:56] not i'm not buying that because the
[1:11:58] bible says we'll meet him in the air
[1:11:59] right where physically his physical
[1:12:01] coming has not happened yet his spirit's
[1:12:03] here upon the earth sure but his
[1:12:05] physical coming has not come we're still
[1:12:07] waiting to meet him in the air we're
[1:12:08] going to meet a literal jesus the same
[1:12:10] one that has said in acts 1 we're going
[1:12:12] to meet him in the air right but so so
[1:12:14] to be a false christ christ means the
[1:12:17] anointed or the anointing so many false
[1:12:19] anointed ones shall come and and and
[1:12:23] false prophets and if it were possible
[1:12:24] they'd receive the very elect so so
[1:12:27] jesus saying there'll be a people that
[1:12:28] will be anointed but they'll be false
[1:12:30] anointed
[1:12:32] now this is now brother abraham said
[1:12:33] that this is prophecy so we need to see
[1:12:35] now um if it's prophecy we're living in
[1:12:38] the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:12:41] remember i'm talking about gifts outside
[1:12:43] and outside of christ and in christ
[1:12:45] everyone has a gift we're going to come
[1:12:47] to rebecca we'll get there as i said but
[1:12:48] we're just going on a detour
[1:12:50] now but this detail is important now so
[1:12:52] so notice the lord said false christ
[1:12:55] shall arise and false prophet now christ
[1:12:57] means anointed one so be ones who are
[1:12:59] anointed but they but they are false
[1:13:02] vessels so the anointing can be genuine
[1:13:04] it can be the genuine holy ghost falling
[1:13:06] it's a genuine move of the holy ghost
[1:13:08] but yet the vessel is false
[1:13:11] now how could this be it seems so
[1:13:13] deceiving and it is deceiving but how
[1:13:15] could it be well the thing is that the
[1:13:16] gifts and calling of god are without
[1:13:18] repentance so someone who actually has
[1:13:20] the gift of seeing visions prophecy
[1:13:22] interpretation of of tongues whatever it
[1:13:24] may be they have that before they repent
[1:13:27] it just has to come into the body right
[1:13:29] so so god can even allow it to be used
[1:13:32] but it's a false anointed one but you
[1:13:34] see now the motive of a false anointed
[1:13:36] one will always be not according to the
[1:13:38] word it'll be according to their own
[1:13:40] fallen nature
[1:13:42] because their own fallen nature their
[1:13:43] sin nature they're born with will govern
[1:13:45] them because they're not converted
[1:13:46] completely though they may do miracles
[1:13:48] signs and wonders now
[1:13:50] the purpose of this is to stop people
[1:13:53] truly being united with the word christ
[1:13:55] himself
[1:13:56] this is the purpose we can see it
[1:13:58] through through the through the through
[1:14:00] the bible we can see the first ones if
[1:14:01] we can take it as janice and jamburus as
[1:14:04] you know they were the they were the
[1:14:05] corp magicians of pharaoh and so so
[1:14:08] moses was inspired he was he was
[1:14:10] commissioned by god in the burning bush
[1:14:12] by these two signs i mean you'll deliver
[1:14:14] israel if they don't listen that they
[1:14:16] don't hear the voice of the first or the
[1:14:17] second sign then you'll take the water
[1:14:20] pour it on the ground and become blood
[1:14:21] that'll be the third sign judgment
[1:14:23] starts to happen and so moses goes into
[1:14:26] pharaoh's court he takes a staff he
[1:14:28] throws it on the ground and it turns
[1:14:29] into a serpent
[1:14:31] now you think that's an incredible thing
[1:14:33] and it's an incredible thing
[1:14:35] but then but then pharaoh's magician
[1:14:37] said well well they saw the genuine be
[1:14:39] done and then they copied it after the
[1:14:41] genuine was done first so they threw
[1:14:43] their their rods down and they turned
[1:14:45] into serpents also but then moses once
[1:14:48] swallowed them up
[1:14:49] and then moses picked it up by the turn
[1:14:51] to a staff again where'd their staffs go
[1:14:53] went into this one i've been showing
[1:14:55] that the devil may do false things or
[1:14:58] try and copy what god has done but god
[1:15:00] just follows it up
[1:15:01] i mean it didn't deter moses
[1:15:04] but he he could see it was actually just
[1:15:06] the devil trying to stop the deliverance
[1:15:08] of israel right it didn't stop him
[1:15:11] amen it must be the same thing why
[1:15:13] because moses came with a scriptural uh
[1:15:15] commission
[1:15:17] amen because he was the fulfillment of
[1:15:19] the prophecy given to abraham abraham
[1:15:21] your seed is going to sojourn in a
[1:15:22] strange land 400 years they're going to
[1:15:24] be afflicted but i'm going to bring them
[1:15:25] out with a mighty hand and his ministry
[1:15:28] was an answer to that prophecy so
[1:15:30] therefore he could go down to egypt no
[1:15:31] matter what the what the problems
[1:15:33] happened the obstacles that he faced he
[1:15:35] could go down there because he was he
[1:15:37] was going down with thus saith the lord
[1:15:39] and he could come out packing the
[1:15:40] victory amen so but you see moses did
[1:15:43] the sign first then janice and jamburus
[1:15:45] copied and the whole purpose of that was
[1:15:47] to harden pharaoh's heart to try and
[1:15:49] stop israel leaving amen because
[1:15:52] remember the promise for israel in that
[1:15:54] day is that they would go dwell in the
[1:15:56] land
[1:15:56] that was the promised word for their day
[1:15:59] that was the purpose of the exodus was
[1:16:01] not just to leave egypt but to go into
[1:16:02] the promised land so those false
[1:16:04] anointing ones janice and jamerus they
[1:16:06] were there and they could copy moses up
[1:16:09] to a certain point if you go read
[1:16:11] through the exodus story there comes a
[1:16:13] point they say we can't do this anymore
[1:16:16] amen but it was but they resisted the
[1:16:18] truth so so in second timothy um three
[1:16:21] and eight says now is janice and
[1:16:22] jamerris worsted moses
[1:16:24] so do these also resist the truth men of
[1:16:27] crop minds reprobate concerning the
[1:16:29] faith so they had a faith but not the
[1:16:32] faith amen but they were they were
[1:16:34] resisting the truth so so he says that
[1:16:36] so timothy's saying in the last days
[1:16:38] people like this will come and they'll
[1:16:40] copy what's already be done the
[1:16:41] supernatural has already been done but
[1:16:43] the purpose of it is to resist the truth
[1:16:45] saying have nothing to do with this
[1:16:47] ministry it's got you know that person's
[1:16:49] wrong we're right because look we can do
[1:16:50] the same thing
[1:16:52] but what is that that's false if they
[1:16:53] were true anointed once they would have
[1:16:55] joined up with moses can we come with
[1:16:58] can we come well i see god's visited you
[1:17:00] can we no but they because they were so
[1:17:02] there so so what they did was genuine it
[1:17:05] was the same as what moses did but the
[1:17:07] vessel was false false anointed one
[1:17:10] they were false christ now
[1:17:13] how can and then we can even go down
[1:17:15] let's go down to jesus day if we if we
[1:17:18] were living there before the lord was
[1:17:20] betrayed by jew um yeah the lord was
[1:17:22] betrayed by judas we would have we would
[1:17:25] have probably enjoyed judas's preaching
[1:17:27] remember he was anointed
[1:17:29] he was commissioned go two by two cast
[1:17:31] out devils preach the gospel you know
[1:17:33] heal the sick and so he was anointed by
[1:17:36] the holy ghost he was he was a he was he
[1:17:38] was actually an anointed christ by
[1:17:41] an anointed one
[1:17:43] by the holy ghost and he was sent out
[1:17:46] and he cast out demons healed the sick
[1:17:48] preached the gospel and no and so he was
[1:17:51] a gifted man we would have enjoyed it
[1:17:53] did you hear what brother judas preached
[1:17:55] the other day in that village you see
[1:17:56] the miracle god used them in a mighty
[1:17:58] way praise the lord that would have been
[1:17:59] incredible it would have been incredible
[1:18:02] but you see he was a false anointed one
[1:18:05] the reason he was a false anointing
[1:18:06] because he didn't go to pentecost he did
[1:18:09] not hang around enough to go and be
[1:18:11] truly united with the lord jesus christ
[1:18:13] that's why he's a false anointed one
[1:18:15] and he betrayed the lord we know that
[1:18:16] but you know so we don't ever want to
[1:18:18] fall into that kind of bracket but you
[1:18:20] see he was here to supernatural ministry
[1:18:23] cast out the devil did incredible things
[1:18:25] but he wasn't truly born again
[1:18:27] because he did not go to pentecost but
[1:18:28] he was an anointed you say he was a
[1:18:30] false christ right because he loved
[1:18:32] money more than the word
[1:18:34] because he was a thief he kept the bag
[1:18:36] and that's why you know so so he loved
[1:18:38] something else more than the word and so
[1:18:40] it's fallen nature cause him to betray
[1:18:42] the word itself we don't want to go
[1:18:45] fulfill that i don't believe i'm looking
[1:18:47] at the people that that that are here
[1:18:48] for that are you all following me today
[1:18:50] amen so so a person can preach under the
[1:18:53] inspiration they can have a supernatural
[1:18:55] ministry and yet not actually be born
[1:18:57] again
[1:18:58] and they can be anointed just like judas
[1:19:00] was judah sold the word for 30 pieces of
[1:19:03] silver and people sadly today will sell
[1:19:05] them out for much less than that
[1:19:08] as as the apostles would would be there
[1:19:11] in acts chapter 1
[1:19:13] and they had a meeting saying we've got
[1:19:14] to find someone to replace judas
[1:19:17] and they would even say for he was
[1:19:18] numbered with us and obtained part of
[1:19:20] this ministry so he had part of that
[1:19:23] holy ghost ministry there i mean before
[1:19:25] the lord jesus christ was crucified he
[1:19:27] wasn't just an onlooker he was part of
[1:19:29] it he was part of the inner circle you
[1:19:31] know he was active in the ministry his
[1:19:33] act of getting the
[1:19:34] word to go out
[1:19:36] but yet jesus in john 6 called him a
[1:19:39] devil
[1:19:40] he knew exactly who he was but the lord
[1:19:43] to me
[1:19:44] well
[1:19:45] i'm not god obviously but he lets people
[1:19:48] do things but yet he knows he's that
[1:19:50] that person's going to betray him in the
[1:19:52] end
[1:19:53] even call them friend
[1:19:56] so
[1:19:57] we have to go beyond
[1:20:00] just having gifts
[1:20:02] they've got to go into the body
[1:20:04] jesus would even say in matthew chapter
[1:20:06] 7 and verse 20 down to 23 he says
[1:20:09] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[1:20:11] them so the life that's produced not
[1:20:12] just what's said but the life everyday
[1:20:14] life that's produced that's the fruit
[1:20:16] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:20:18] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:20:20] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:20:22] father which is in heaven what is the
[1:20:24] will of the father the word of god
[1:20:26] amen so he that doeth the word that is
[1:20:28] the you know that is the will of the
[1:20:30] father right many will say to me in that
[1:20:32] day lord lord have we not prophesied in
[1:20:34] thy name and the thy name have cast out
[1:20:36] devils in thy name done many mighty
[1:20:39] many wonderful works
[1:20:41] then i will profess unto them i never
[1:20:43] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:20:44] iniquity so now notice this is matthew 7
[1:20:47] 20-23 if you're looking for it so notice
[1:20:50] jesus does not deny that they did those
[1:20:53] things he does not say no you're a liar
[1:20:56] you never cast out devils in my name you
[1:20:58] never prophesied in my name he never did
[1:21:00] many wonderful works he never ever
[1:21:02] denies that they did those things but
[1:21:05] the thing he says is i never knew you so
[1:21:07] i never became one with you amen sure
[1:21:10] you were anointed you're inspired by my
[1:21:12] own spirit to do those things in my name
[1:21:14] but you never became united with me so
[1:21:17] he says i never knew you depart me ye
[1:21:19] that work iniquity so these ones they do
[1:21:22] incredible miracles now i trust you can
[1:21:23] see i'm talking about today
[1:21:26] right but we can bring it in down home
[1:21:27] too i'm not just talking about out there
[1:21:29] let's bring it in here
[1:21:30] right so so so people can prophesy in
[1:21:33] his name and the prophecy can come true
[1:21:35] they can cast out devils
[1:21:37] amen what is healing what is laying on
[1:21:40] of hands praying for someone because of
[1:21:42] the the devil causes sickness right you
[1:21:44] cast the devil like that sickness of you
[1:21:46] know that devil of sickness gets cast
[1:21:47] out person begins to be made well
[1:21:50] you know laying hands in different
[1:21:51] things and have they and in thy name
[1:21:53] done many wonderful works so we could we
[1:21:56] could fulfill all that
[1:21:58] but yet the law can say i never knew you
[1:22:00] but notice now these people are making
[1:22:02] an appeal to the lord in that day the
[1:22:04] great great white throat
[1:22:06] great white throne judgment day
[1:22:10] they're making appeal but lord we did
[1:22:12] all this lord so so basically he's
[1:22:15] saying he's saying but lord i i
[1:22:18] i did this and i did this and i prayed
[1:22:20] this and i preached this i sang this i
[1:22:22] went here it was all it's all meaning me
[1:22:24] lord but i've read this much i've prayed
[1:22:26] this much i've done all these things see
[1:22:28] it's all i i
[1:22:30] but someone who so it's all performance
[1:22:33] they're trying to merit heaven by what
[1:22:35] they have done
[1:22:36] but we are not entitled to heaven by
[1:22:39] what we have done
[1:22:40] that was never meant to be the picture
[1:22:42] salvation is not the blood and your own
[1:22:45] human works salvation is the blood alone
[1:22:47] amen is by the cross of calvary alone it
[1:22:50] is not blood and the blood and your good
[1:22:53] conduct
[1:22:54] we know we have good conduct but because
[1:22:56] of the blood
[1:22:57] right we have works because of what he
[1:22:59] has done i mean because it's his life
[1:23:01] living through us amen just but it's not
[1:23:03] we will never ever be entitled to
[1:23:06] anything by what we have done that is
[1:23:09] human reasoning and human reasoning will
[1:23:11] always fail amen but a true christian
[1:23:14] can only validate their christian
[1:23:16] experience because he has saved them he
[1:23:18] has redeemed them he has washed them in
[1:23:20] his own blood he's filled them with the
[1:23:22] holy spirit he has revealed himself to
[1:23:24] them it's all him him him amen because
[1:23:27] and i live for him because he first
[1:23:29] loved me that's a real christian where
[1:23:31] they can look back and see the person i
[1:23:33] once was though i may be religious i may
[1:23:35] know the bible from the cover to the
[1:23:37] cover
[1:23:38] but there was a time where i met him and
[1:23:40] he changed my nature and it wasn't me
[1:23:42] trying to be the christian he came into
[1:23:44] me and now he's a christian in my life
[1:23:47] amen this is not learned behavior it's
[1:23:49] not adjusting to a social norm of a
[1:23:51] church and trying to conform to a word
[1:23:53] no it's a full surrender that he changes
[1:23:56] your nature transforms your life i mean
[1:23:58] that's real christianity jesus did not
[1:24:01] die that you could have a part in your
[1:24:02] own salvation no it's all him alone
[1:24:06] amen and that's what that's what a true
[1:24:08] christian does is it's all him
[1:24:11] it's all the lord
[1:24:13] it's not what i have done it's what he
[1:24:14] has done that matters
[1:24:17] hallelujah now we can go back into the
[1:24:19] old testament and we can take the
[1:24:21] prophet balaam this is the numbers 22 to
[1:24:23] 25 you want to go read the account
[1:24:26] now it's amazing here was balaam
[1:24:29] he was a false prophet had a genuine
[1:24:31] anointing
[1:24:33] but but his prophecies are still playing
[1:24:35] out today
[1:24:37] now talia could you put up numbers 24 8
[1:24:39] and 9 for me
[1:24:43] so he wasn't a true prophet if he was as
[1:24:46] i said like janice and generous
[1:24:48] see he withstood moses like janice and
[1:24:50] jamers did because remember the king of
[1:24:52] moab hired him to try and get god to
[1:24:55] curse israel because the king of moab
[1:24:56] knew hey i can't send my armies out to
[1:24:58] fight israel they've defeated others
[1:25:00] we'll lose too so we're gonna change
[1:25:01] tactic so he said if i can get someone
[1:25:04] who is in contact with god
[1:25:06] and get them to be anointed and inspired
[1:25:08] by god and to and to pronounce a curse
[1:25:10] on these people then i've won so he went
[1:25:12] and tried to hire balaam and at first
[1:25:14] balaam was told by god don't go
[1:25:17] but then but then the prince of moab
[1:25:19] came you know that greater dignitaries
[1:25:21] came to him with more money different
[1:25:23] things he says i'll ask again
[1:25:25] and god tells them yeah you can go now
[1:25:27] god's first decision was the right one
[1:25:29] but god will allow your free moral
[1:25:31] agency to actually go against his will
[1:25:34] because he's a gentleman he does not
[1:25:36] force you to obey him you have to
[1:25:38] surrender to his leadership
[1:25:40] and many times it's contrary to our own
[1:25:42] desire see if balaam could lay down his
[1:25:44] own desire for money he would not be the
[1:25:46] balaam of the bible
[1:25:49] amen she says god hath brought him out
[1:25:51] of egypt now this is him speaking under
[1:25:53] inspiration here of the holy ghost
[1:25:56] he hath as it were the strength of it of
[1:25:58] an unicorn he shall eat up the nation's
[1:26:01] um eat up the nations his enemies and
[1:26:03] shall break their bones and pierce them
[1:26:05] through with his arrows now verse 9 he
[1:26:07] crutched he laid low as a lion as a
[1:26:10] great lion who shall stir him up blessed
[1:26:12] is he that blesseth thee and cursed us
[1:26:15] he that curses thee
[1:26:17] now if you look at the nations of the
[1:26:19] world
[1:26:20] there's many nations laying basically
[1:26:22] their virtually failed states
[1:26:24] they're in ruin today because they curse
[1:26:26] israel
[1:26:28] whether they know what they're doing or
[1:26:29] not because they've tried to we're going
[1:26:31] to wipe them off the map we're going to
[1:26:32] destroy them look look look what's
[1:26:34] happened to these people they are they
[1:26:36] are virtually it's failed states broken
[1:26:38] economies broken generations all these
[1:26:41] things why because they've tried to
[1:26:42] curse israel but god threw a false
[1:26:46] vessel
[1:26:47] said whoever blesses thee will be
[1:26:49] blessed and whoever curses he will be
[1:26:51] cursed
[1:26:52] that's why there's still some nations
[1:26:53] that still have a bit of blessing today
[1:26:54] because they've always been on israel's
[1:26:56] side but there'll come a time where the
[1:26:58] whole world will turn against them and
[1:27:00] we're seeing that in its in its
[1:27:02] fulfillment
[1:27:04] so i'm sure we can agree with you i i
[1:27:05] don't need to go into details of lebanon
[1:27:07] and syria and different countries this
[1:27:10] is just you know we'll we'll are aware
[1:27:12] of these things
[1:27:13] right so but it's amazing because this
[1:27:15] was a true prophecy now notice just
[1:27:17] because he is a false prophet doesn't
[1:27:19] mean we get our twink out and scrub out
[1:27:21] everything he said
[1:27:22] it was still god
[1:27:24] it was it was a genuine anointing upon a
[1:27:27] false vessel now we can even go down to
[1:27:30] numbers 24 1 and 2. i just want to show
[1:27:32] you this to you just to say just to show
[1:27:33] i'm not just making up stuff
[1:27:35] right so numbers 24 1 and 2 if we can
[1:27:37] put that up there we go and when balaam
[1:27:39] saw that it pleased the lord to bless
[1:27:41] israel he went not as other times to
[1:27:43] seek for enchantments but he set his
[1:27:45] face towards the wilderness and verse
[1:27:47] two and balaam lifted up his eyes and he
[1:27:49] saw israel abiding in his tents
[1:27:50] according to their tribes and the spirit
[1:27:52] of god came upon him
[1:27:54] so as a spirit of god upon him that that
[1:27:57] caused him to speak
[1:27:59] so he was a false vessel but he had a
[1:28:02] true gift
[1:28:04] as i've said that prophecy you can see
[1:28:05] the blessing and cursing what he said
[1:28:07] however many thousand years ago is
[1:28:09] playing out today because it's still
[1:28:11] god's
[1:28:12] word so he had a genuine anointing
[1:28:16] and god genuinely met him and god
[1:28:18] genuinely spoke through him but he was a
[1:28:20] false the vessel was false but the
[1:28:22] anointing was true
[1:28:24] he was a true he had a true prophet he
[1:28:27] was a true prophet but it but but it was
[1:28:29] in a wrong unconverted vessel
[1:28:32] now
[1:28:34] and balaam's whole point of being hired
[1:28:36] by by by the king of mob is to stop the
[1:28:38] children of israel going into the land
[1:28:40] as i said about janice and jamers the
[1:28:42] the whole pattern of this is it stops
[1:28:44] the people fulfilling the promise of
[1:28:46] their day
[1:28:48] now
[1:28:50] if we have all this in mind
[1:28:54] then we can actually bring uh rebecca
[1:28:56] and her family interview
[1:28:58] okay so
[1:29:00] are you all with me
[1:29:02] okay so now we can bring rebecca and her
[1:29:04] family interview
[1:29:05] now as i as we read there
[1:29:08] all of her family received gifts
[1:29:11] they were believers because they said
[1:29:13] the lord has done this thing we can can
[1:29:15] you speak neither good or bad
[1:29:17] so they weren't they believed in the
[1:29:19] lord they all received gifts from
[1:29:21] eliezer now if you go look into history
[1:29:24] the post-world war ii healing revival
[1:29:27] historians say was initiated by the
[1:29:29] ministry of brother branham
[1:29:31] and and and if you go look into history
[1:29:33] when that started in 1946 or 48
[1:29:37] whenever it started there there was a
[1:29:38] massive increase of healing evangelists
[1:29:40] just in the north american continent
[1:29:42] about over 200 had 10 revivals and they
[1:29:44] went around america at its height so
[1:29:47] there was a there was a great explosion
[1:29:49] of gifts and the reason was is because
[1:29:52] the spirit of elijah was poured out upon
[1:29:54] the earth
[1:29:55] right and it fell on all kinds of people
[1:29:58] but the thing is though and many
[1:30:00] miracles signs and wonders were done
[1:30:02] but the reason was is because the spirit
[1:30:05] of elijah was poured out because god was
[1:30:07] going to call a bride
[1:30:09] through a ministry just as eliezer gave
[1:30:11] gifts to the whole family
[1:30:13] so gifts were poured out
[1:30:16] but many of these gifts were used for
[1:30:17] selfish gain
[1:30:19] trying to be who has the biggest tent
[1:30:20] who's got the biggest ministry who's got
[1:30:22] the biggest video i mean tv ministry all
[1:30:25] these different things all about me me
[1:30:27] me it was all about personal gain making
[1:30:29] boundaries different things but the
[1:30:31] spirit of god never came for that the
[1:30:34] spirit of god came to prepare people for
[1:30:36] a rapture aiming to restore a true book
[1:30:38] of acts worship to restore a true book
[1:30:41] of acts church to be restored because
[1:30:42] the age of restoration amen when we go
[1:30:45] back where the original pentecost
[1:30:47] happened and where god dwelt in his
[1:30:49] people once again amen manifested his
[1:30:52] will through his people amen so now just
[1:30:54] as just as eliezer was sent to get a
[1:30:57] bride for the promised son so the spirit
[1:30:59] of elijah was sent upon the earth i mean
[1:31:01] to get a bride ready for the promised
[1:31:03] son now we know there's been a bride
[1:31:04] down through seven church ages but
[1:31:06] there's got to be a bride upon the earth
[1:31:08] that breaks the cycle of death amen that
[1:31:10] does not die in the faith amen but their
[1:31:13] bodies are changed while they're alive
[1:31:15] hallelujah that they are actually
[1:31:17] restored back to the original faith of
[1:31:19] the fathers
[1:31:20] now this post-world war ii healing
[1:31:22] revival morphed into the charismatic
[1:31:24] revival whose effects are still going on
[1:31:26] today
[1:31:28] so the initiative that was the ministry
[1:31:29] of brother branham
[1:31:31] not to lift up a man but say this is
[1:31:33] what god did now remember eliezer came
[1:31:36] for rebecca
[1:31:38] but her whole family and and rebecca
[1:31:40] received gifts now some people don't
[1:31:43] want to be the anointed one in the end
[1:31:44] time because i think it's just false
[1:31:46] anointed ones in the end time but
[1:31:47] there's a true anointed one in the end
[1:31:49] time the bride is anointed the bride is
[1:31:52] gifted i mean we're gifted not just
[1:31:54] these four walls around the world the
[1:31:55] bride of christ is a gifted woman and
[1:31:58] she's been gifted by through the hands
[1:32:00] of the anointed servant amen the
[1:32:02] spiritual gifts are within her god is
[1:32:04] still manifesting people don't want to
[1:32:06] be the anointed one no no everyone is
[1:32:08] anointed in the end time they're either
[1:32:10] anointed by unbelief
[1:32:12] by by their culture by tradition just by
[1:32:15] church entity a religious spirit or they
[1:32:17] have the spirit of god
[1:32:19] amen so we want to we want to still be
[1:32:21] anointed we must be anointed we're not
[1:32:23] here just to go through a lecture
[1:32:25] christianity's a supernatural life it's
[1:32:27] not a natural life the atmosphere you
[1:32:29] carry around you as a believer is
[1:32:30] supernatural it's contrary to this
[1:32:32] world's atmosphere amen where this
[1:32:34] atmosphere of the world is just
[1:32:35] lukewarmness indifference not caring
[1:32:37] that's not within us and it's not you
[1:32:39] trying to be on fire god makes the fire
[1:32:42] why because the atmosphere that you
[1:32:43] carry
[1:32:44] hallelujah so now
[1:32:47] see some people don't like
[1:32:49] me to say this kind of thing that you
[1:32:51] know brother brown had an eliezer
[1:32:52] ministry because it's the holy because
[1:32:55] they say well it's the holy ghost
[1:32:57] hunting the bride that's true but god
[1:32:59] uses men
[1:33:00] god always uses his body
[1:33:02] because of he didn't you know because
[1:33:04] you even you look at peter there's
[1:33:06] cornelius that about gentile praying in
[1:33:08] his house he's a he's a devout jewish
[1:33:09] way he's a what do you call it a someone
[1:33:11] who converts i can't i can't
[1:33:13] find the word right now but you know he
[1:33:15] believed in the jewish faith they were
[1:33:17] gentile an angel appears to him says
[1:33:19] cornelius your arms and your prayers
[1:33:21] have gone up before god
[1:33:23] now go get peter he'll tell you the
[1:33:24] words of eternal life
[1:33:26] why didn't why did the angel just just
[1:33:28] give him the holy ghost because god uses
[1:33:30] the body
[1:33:31] god uses his people upon the earth
[1:33:33] you've got to realize that you and god
[1:33:35] he's actually connected you with his
[1:33:36] program
[1:33:37] he said well god's greater than yeah but
[1:33:40] he's connected you with this program god
[1:33:42] god has no hands on the earth but your
[1:33:45] hands no eyes but your eyes no feet but
[1:33:47] your feet no mouth but your mouth upon
[1:33:49] the earth amen that's why the angel said
[1:33:51] go get peter he'll show you the words of
[1:33:53] eternal life and peter preached them and
[1:33:55] why it's peter spoke these words the
[1:33:57] holy ghost fell upon them and they are
[1:33:59] sealed into the kingdom so god uses man
[1:34:03] hallelujah
[1:34:04] now it is true that the holy ghost is
[1:34:06] hunting a bride but he works through his
[1:34:08] body and i'll say this he's still giving
[1:34:10] an alias a call today i mean because the
[1:34:12] same inspiration is now on a five-fold
[1:34:14] ministry it's also on you amen why do we
[1:34:17] go about this why do we go about our
[1:34:19] daily walk
[1:34:20] it's an eleazar call to people whosoever
[1:34:23] will let them come come drink of this
[1:34:25] water of life that flows amen that will
[1:34:27] give you eternal life that will give you
[1:34:28] rest and it will give you a peace in
[1:34:30] your heart it'll change your life it'll
[1:34:32] change your world come and drink amen
[1:34:35] that's what we do don't we that's the
[1:34:37] life we love that we want to see others
[1:34:39] meet the same jesus
[1:34:41] see others fall in love with him like we
[1:34:43] have all this joy that i had if you
[1:34:45] could only you can have it if you want
[1:34:46] it hallelujah because the world didn't
[1:34:48] give it to me and the world can't take
[1:34:50] it away
[1:34:51] amen so rebecca and her family believed
[1:34:53] in god because laban and bethel said
[1:34:56] this thing proceeds from the lord we
[1:34:57] cannot speak unto thee good or bad
[1:35:00] remember eliezer gave the gave the
[1:35:01] testimony that abraham said the angel of
[1:35:04] god will go before me
[1:35:06] hallelujah so it was a supernatural
[1:35:08] meeting there's a divine meeting at the
[1:35:10] well and he gives the whole thing and
[1:35:12] you know he didn't say to rebecca you
[1:35:14] know the angel of god has come before
[1:35:16] you and this is you know come before me
[1:35:17] and this is why you're doing this but he
[1:35:19] just asked can you give me a drink and
[1:35:21] she just feels inspired oh i'll give you
[1:35:23] a drink and also water your camels
[1:35:25] and and he she has no idea that she is
[1:35:28] fulfilling a prayer that was in his
[1:35:30] heart
[1:35:30] and actually she's being moved by the
[1:35:32] inspiration of god
[1:35:34] because the angel lord went before him
[1:35:36] what to do to prepare her heart to
[1:35:37] receive
[1:35:39] the message that she'll go and be
[1:35:40] married to isaac
[1:35:41] hallelujah so you've got to see that
[1:35:43] your life is bigger than what you think
[1:35:45] amen but god went before to prepare you
[1:35:48] that when you hear his true jubilee call
[1:35:50] the true gospel you receive it
[1:35:53] amen and become one with him i mean but
[1:35:55] now notice now
[1:35:57] the similarities between rebecca and her
[1:35:59] family cease right there
[1:36:01] the only similarity is sure they're
[1:36:03] family but also they all receive gifts
[1:36:07] but now but notice only rebecca married
[1:36:09] the bridegroom
[1:36:11] so they had their gifts the mother the
[1:36:13] the you know her family had gifts and no
[1:36:15] doubt they would have enjoyed those
[1:36:16] gifts
[1:36:17] but
[1:36:18] eliezer was sent for a bride
[1:36:21] he was not sent just to send out gifts
[1:36:24] he was after an elected woman
[1:36:26] that's that was the purpose in his heart
[1:36:28] to find her find me a find a bride for
[1:36:31] my son the father said abraham said amen
[1:36:34] so only rebecca married the bridegroom
[1:36:37] amen only she became mrs isaac
[1:36:40] amen she was no longer after she married
[1:36:44] isaac she was no longer rebecca of naha
[1:36:47] amen her old identity was gone when she
[1:36:50] married isaac and it's the same thing
[1:36:52] with you and i when you become one with
[1:36:54] christ by the true baptism of the holy
[1:36:56] ghost your old identity is gone amen
[1:36:59] it's washed in his blood god in the sea
[1:37:01] of his forgetfulness you may be living
[1:37:03] in the same body but you're a different
[1:37:05] person
[1:37:06] someone says about your past you say
[1:37:08] hold on that guy died
[1:37:10] that guy died sure sometimes we're gonna
[1:37:12] talk about our past if it's actually
[1:37:13] still affecting us but why should we be
[1:37:15] and and then we can deal with it right
[1:37:17] but why be haunted by a memory and that
[1:37:20] memory is associated with a different
[1:37:22] person it's not even you it was your old
[1:37:24] man it's your old nature but that person
[1:37:26] dies
[1:37:27] hallelujah so the devil comes against
[1:37:29] you with your memory so hold on
[1:37:31] i didn't do that
[1:37:33] he says yes you did no no no that was
[1:37:34] the old me he died
[1:37:37] he died he really died i didn't just
[1:37:38] turn over a new leaf satan but you were
[1:37:41] dethroned out of my heart amen and the
[1:37:43] lord became the king of my life i became
[1:37:45] a new creature i'm not patched up we're
[1:37:47] not a patched up people we're a new
[1:37:49] creation
[1:37:50] amen not a not one made over a new one
[1:37:54] i mean that's why the things you once do
[1:37:56] you can't do i mean the things you once
[1:37:57] did rather you can't do them no more as
[1:38:00] i've given the simple illustration of
[1:38:02] when i was a child i couldn't stand
[1:38:04] broccoli
[1:38:05] so things i couldn't stand now i eat
[1:38:08] because something happened within me
[1:38:10] hallelujah but now praise the lord eat
[1:38:13] your greens children and adults it'll do
[1:38:15] you good but you see things you once did
[1:38:18] and you loved because when the lord
[1:38:20] changes your nature changes you you
[1:38:21] can't go back there
[1:38:23] as i said i used to make home brew
[1:38:25] different things i could live in a
[1:38:26] brewery now and be sober
[1:38:28] because it's not within me to want it
[1:38:29] it's gone the desire left all those
[1:38:31] things and and you say where did it go i
[1:38:33] don't know he took it from me though
[1:38:34] that's all that matters
[1:38:36] hallelujah
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:38] so we are not a patched up people we are
[1:38:41] a new creation
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:44] hallelujah so her old identity her old
[1:38:47] life was gone when she married isaac but
[1:38:49] her family stayed in the land
[1:38:52] only she got on the camel
[1:38:54] and left
[1:38:55] they didn't they all got gifts they
[1:38:58] stayed there
[1:38:59] hallelujah and brother ram says that
[1:39:01] because those camels carried her to her
[1:39:03] isaac and the same holy ghost that we
[1:39:04] water with praise and thanksgiving will
[1:39:07] pack us to our bridegroom
[1:39:09] hallelujah
[1:39:11] amen so now
[1:39:14] see
[1:39:16] uh paul would say in romans 4 and 8
[1:39:18] blessed is the man to whom god will not
[1:39:19] impute sin so he doesn't impute sin to
[1:39:22] your new self
[1:39:24] that's to your old self and that's gone
[1:39:26] under the blood of jesus christ amen we
[1:39:28] have a perfect lamb that he gave his
[1:39:31] life to totally remove sin and he
[1:39:33] doesn't remember it no more it's in the
[1:39:35] sea of his forgetfulness hallelujah he
[1:39:38] doesn't put it in a jar or he does not
[1:39:40] save he does not archive your old life
[1:39:43] for later
[1:39:44] it's gone
[1:39:45] and uh and the forensic i.t guy that the
[1:39:48] devil is to try and find that deleted
[1:39:50] file he can't find it
[1:39:52] doesn't matter how back he goes back the
[1:39:53] iterations it's not there because the
[1:39:55] blood of jesus christ annihilates it
[1:39:58] hallelujah it's totally gone amen so now
[1:40:01] only the true believer has a name
[1:40:03] changed from church to bride remember
[1:40:05] within christendom there's a church in
[1:40:07] the bride right so that's why brother
[1:40:09] i'm sitting the first seal i'm going to
[1:40:10] call you bride now so you'll understand
[1:40:13] amen so now now it's only the true
[1:40:15] believer now as their name has changed
[1:40:16] from church to bride just like rebecca
[1:40:19] went from rebecca to mrs isaac
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:23] so now notice now her family none of
[1:40:26] them left
[1:40:27] the land and went into the promised land
[1:40:29] and this is very significant we'll come
[1:40:30] to it soon they stayed right there in
[1:40:32] the world and enjoyed their gifts though
[1:40:34] they were religious they said they
[1:40:36] believed in god they had church
[1:40:38] different things they had those gifts
[1:40:39] now but they stayed right there
[1:40:42] so none of the others left only rep now
[1:40:45] this may be very elementary it's obvious
[1:40:46] of course rebecca got on the camel and
[1:40:48] left
[1:40:49] but where she traveled to is very
[1:40:50] significant i mean because the promised
[1:40:53] land was more than just a land flowing
[1:40:54] with milk and hunting it was more than a
[1:40:56] nice well-watered land they had that in
[1:40:58] goshen
[1:40:59] right so it was more than just nice
[1:41:01] rolling hills and nice places to live
[1:41:03] and being free from task masters the
[1:41:05] promised land is more than that because
[1:41:07] in that promised land is a resurrection
[1:41:10] i mean that was the most important thing
[1:41:11] when when abraham had to find a bearing
[1:41:14] place for his wife sarah he went to the
[1:41:16] sons of heth and he and he said oh i
[1:41:19] need to buy a bearing place
[1:41:21] and he and it says in the scripture i
[1:41:22] don't have it but in genesis he
[1:41:24] stipulated the boundaries of that land
[1:41:26] so therefore the sons of heth after the
[1:41:29] purchase was done could not could not
[1:41:31] make a land dispute happen and said no
[1:41:33] no hold on it's not this but it's this
[1:41:35] but no no he he ordained the boundaries
[1:41:38] he said listen we've got to get this
[1:41:39] right within this boundary is the
[1:41:41] bearing place outside this boundary is
[1:41:44] not the bearing place and because he had
[1:41:46] to find a place to bury his beloved
[1:41:48] bride
[1:41:49] hallelujah so so he paid the price in
[1:41:52] full that she could be buried in that
[1:41:54] land now jesus when he died on calvary
[1:41:56] he purchased our salvation in full
[1:41:58] amen he he gave the boundaries of the
[1:42:00] land
[1:42:01] he paid it in full that when the devil
[1:42:04] came along to try and say hold on
[1:42:06] peter james and john i've got claim on
[1:42:08] them
[1:42:09] jesus could say hold on no no no no i
[1:42:11] purchased their salvation and their
[1:42:12] redemption and full amen though they
[1:42:15] have gone the way of the grave they're
[1:42:16] mine they're not yours devil they're
[1:42:17] mine and i say bury me in christ
[1:42:21] don't bury me in a church don't bear me
[1:42:23] in man's ideas bear me in the lord jesus
[1:42:25] christ the word that's where i want to
[1:42:26] be buried i mean that's why joseph would
[1:42:29] would be inspired he'd say to his son
[1:42:32] say to us say to his descendants don't
[1:42:34] bury no jacob said to joseph rather
[1:42:36] don't bury me here and then joseph said
[1:42:39] the same thing don't bury me here
[1:42:41] because remember joseph could have built
[1:42:42] the biggest
[1:42:43] biggest uh mausoleum tomb for his father
[1:42:46] because he was the right hand of pharaoh
[1:42:48] but jacob told don't bury me here
[1:42:51] sure the tombs are fine sure the
[1:42:52] pyramids are nice but don't bury me here
[1:42:55] bury take my body and bear me up in the
[1:42:57] promised land why because being a
[1:42:59] prophet he could see there was a
[1:43:00] resurrection in that promised land and
[1:43:02] joseph he said to he said to the people
[1:43:04] concerning his bones don't don't leave
[1:43:06] me here
[1:43:07] god's gonna take you one day when you do
[1:43:10] don't leave my bones take my bones with
[1:43:12] you and bury me in that land why because
[1:43:15] there's a resurrection in that place
[1:43:18] hallelujah so now here comes here comes
[1:43:21] rebecca
[1:43:22] and she leaves she leaves where she was
[1:43:25] with those gifts she comes she becomes
[1:43:27] united with isaac and she is now buried
[1:43:30] in the promised land
[1:43:32] hallelujah this is the big difference to
[1:43:34] me is that it's not it's can you put up
[1:43:36] uh genesis 49 30 for me and then we'll
[1:43:39] just kind of wrap up with this but you
[1:43:41] see to me this is the biggest thing she
[1:43:43] became united with isaac she became mrs
[1:43:46] isaac though they are all gifted the
[1:43:47] rest of her family stayed outside the
[1:43:49] body but she went into the body of
[1:43:51] christ amen and she left there she left
[1:43:54] her old life behind she went into the
[1:43:56] promised land she lived in that land may
[1:43:59] i live in the word
[1:44:01] am i living the anointed word for our
[1:44:02] day we have a promised land i mean sure
[1:44:04] there's lots of nice places in the in
[1:44:06] the world like egypt but no no bury me
[1:44:08] in christ
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:12] hallelujah do we have that genesis 49
[1:44:14] and 30.
[1:44:15] amen and then she was buried in the same
[1:44:18] place as abraham isaac and jacob
[1:44:24] hallelujah and it should be the same
[1:44:26] thing with you and i
[1:44:27] here we are in the cave that is in the
[1:44:30] field of machpelah this is this is where
[1:44:33] abraham bought the bearing place it says
[1:44:34] it here which is before memory in the
[1:44:36] land of canaan which abraham brought
[1:44:38] with the field um uh with the field of
[1:44:40] of of ephraim the hittite for a
[1:44:42] possession for a bearing place there
[1:44:44] they buried abraham and isaac's wife
[1:44:46] there they buried um so there they
[1:44:48] buried abraham and sarah his wife there
[1:44:51] they buried isaac and rebecca's wife and
[1:44:53] there i buried leah
[1:44:55] so this is this is um
[1:44:57] it says there they at the purchase of
[1:44:59] the field and of the cave that is
[1:45:01] therein was from the children of heth
[1:45:03] now verse 33 and when jacob had made an
[1:45:06] end of commanding his sons he gathered
[1:45:08] up his feet to his bed yield up the
[1:45:10] ghost and was gathered unto his people
[1:45:12] so he's saying now that rebecca was
[1:45:14] buried in the same place
[1:45:17] hallelujah and then when jesus came
[1:45:19] forth
[1:45:20] he says many of the saints arose
[1:45:22] with him matthew 27
[1:45:24] who was that that was rebecca
[1:45:26] abraham isaac and jacob many of them
[1:45:28] arose walked about the streets about 40
[1:45:31] days and went out with him at at his
[1:45:32] great ascension
[1:45:34] hallelujah that's why i say sure you can
[1:45:36] be gifted but
[1:45:38] fully surrender your life to the lord
[1:45:40] and allow him to put that gift into the
[1:45:42] body well how do you do that it's very
[1:45:44] simple you repent
[1:45:46] be baptized name the lord jesus christ
[1:45:48] remission sin and you shall receive the
[1:45:49] gift of the holy ghost not just to be
[1:45:51] anointed now but to be sealed to the day
[1:45:53] of your redemption
[1:45:54] i mean false christs are just anointed
[1:45:57] they have an anointing but their soul is
[1:45:59] not changed
[1:46:00] right but a true person is anointed
[1:46:03] and their soul is changed and god abides
[1:46:06] in their soul
[1:46:07] makes him a new creature in christ
[1:46:10] so may we be like rebecca
[1:46:12] god's poured out gifts in this age we're
[1:46:14] born with them as well
[1:46:16] but may when we heard the eliezer call
[1:46:18] don't just use your gift and run around
[1:46:19] do what you want with it no surrender to
[1:46:21] the lord get a allow the holy ghost to
[1:46:24] take you
[1:46:25] to the bridegroom
[1:46:27] hallelujah that's what uh the true seal
[1:46:29] of the holy ghost unites you with the
[1:46:31] bridegroom the anointed word
[1:46:33] hallelujah
[1:46:35] amen so praise the lord
[1:46:38] hallelujah that's the difference i want
[1:46:40] to be in the land i want to i want to
[1:46:41] die in christ
[1:46:43] let me be buried in his righteousness
[1:46:45] not in church righteousness not in my
[1:46:46] own righteousness i want to be wrapped
[1:46:48] in his righteousness because i have no
[1:46:50] righteousness of myself i can't offer
[1:46:52] anything to god amen
[1:46:55] i just want to say lord you made a way
[1:46:56] for me that day on calvary and that's
[1:46:59] all i come with is your perfect blood
[1:47:01] that was shed in my place amen let's
[1:47:03] have the musicians this morning amen

[1:47:16] if you have a question you're welcome to
[1:47:18] come see me after service but you see
[1:47:20] everyone's gifted don't be surprised
[1:47:22] people are gifted people can have all

[1:47:27] your it's in the body
[1:47:29] right you're one with christ let him use
