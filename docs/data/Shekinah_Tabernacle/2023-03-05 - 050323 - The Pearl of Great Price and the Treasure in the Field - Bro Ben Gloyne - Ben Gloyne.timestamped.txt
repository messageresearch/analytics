[46:54] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[46:57] friends you can have your seats this
[46:58] morning
[46:59] um so I want to talk about pearls and
[47:00] treasure in the field amen praise the
[47:03] Lord I was watching uh we're watching
[47:04] The Chosen or something and I think uh
[47:06] Jesus is saying you know the Kingdom of
[47:08] Heaven is like a pearl and you know that
[47:10] got me going and so you know
[47:12] um you know we know the Parables they
[47:14] have a far deeper meeting than just a
[47:15] you know there's a you know there's a
[47:17] meaning in them and we know a Merchants
[47:19] so I want to kind of I know it speaks
[47:21] about the treasure in the field and in
[47:22] the goodly pearl but I want to do the
[47:24] vice versa today but they do tie
[47:26] together I believe so uh yo so we know a
[47:28] merchant he you know you know he trades
[47:30] Goods to make a profit that's what a
[47:31] merchant man does he's like a
[47:32] businessman right he's in trading stuff
[47:34] to to to earn a profit and things and
[47:37] you know people are you know people
[47:38] Through the Ages have been seeking and
[47:40] trading Pearls of Wisdom they've been
[47:42] looking for little pieces or nuggets of
[47:45] um sound advice and words to live by and
[47:47] uh and it is very true today that people
[47:49] are are taking different parts of
[47:52] philosophies and religions and try and
[47:53] live by them you know there's a big
[47:55] universalism of just blending all the
[47:57] religions all the good parts of every
[47:59] religion together and living by those by
[48:01] those uh philosophy fees and that's
[48:03] that's like seeking goodly pearls people
[48:05] are just trying to find good advice to
[48:07] live by in this world that's falling
[48:08] apart but it's when the pearl of great
[48:11] price when when a person really finds
[48:13] that great pearl of great price which is
[48:16] the Lord Jesus Christ his word I mean
[48:18] then and it's when they see the great
[48:20] value of him they gladly forsake all
[48:22] sell all to have him because if you
[48:25] think about just a merchantment you're
[48:27] trading and you're selling pearls and
[48:28] different things it's the value that
[48:30] they place in the pearl is if they'll
[48:32] keep it or if they'll sell it if they if
[48:34] they value something of a low value
[48:36] they'll gladly trade it for something of
[48:37] a higher value you know there's um I
[48:39] think in America there's been someone
[48:41] who's traded from a paper clip to a
[48:43] house people have done that kind of
[48:44] thing they've traded up and up and up
[48:45] till they finally get a house but you
[48:47] know that person doing that kind of
[48:49] thing would never trade something for
[48:50] what they have if they didn't think what
[48:52] they were going to get was greater value
[48:53] than what they had and so it takes a it
[48:56] takes a real Revelation to to see when
[49:00] you finally come across a pool of great
[49:01] price more than a philosophy more than
[49:03] just a religion more than just a good
[49:05] code of ethics or a way of life but when
[49:07] you meet the resurrection and the life I
[49:10] mean when you really esteem him the
[49:12] greatest value that they can be ever had
[49:14] in the you know you know in your own all
[49:15] of creation then you'll gladly sell all
[49:17] that you have to have him you know there
[49:19] was a brother Brown would tell a story
[49:21] of a boy who'd go up into his attic he
[49:23] wanted an ice cream he had no money and
[49:25] he and he was searching around the house
[49:26] to try and find something to trade for
[49:28] an ice cream and he went up to the attic
[49:29] and he and he and he found a stamp you
[49:31] know it didn't look like much to him
[49:32] little old stampany and he took that and
[49:35] he took it to the Dairy Corner Dairy and
[49:36] he you know and he asked the person you
[49:39] know running the dairy you know can I
[49:40] have an ice cream and then so they so of
[49:43] course you know the dariona says well
[49:44] what are you gonna pay with and he said
[49:46] well I've got this stamped you know can
[49:47] I can I can I have a can I have an ice
[49:49] cream for this stamp and now they now
[49:51] the now the owner of the dairy looked at
[49:53] that stamp and he placed a greater value
[49:55] on on the stamp than the boy did because
[49:57] the boy just thought the valley of that
[49:59] stamp is ice cream but then this man
[50:01] thought well this is worth well more
[50:03] than ice cream and he gave him a dollar
[50:05] for the stamp and you know the boy
[50:06] thought he'd just get 25 cents and then
[50:09] that and then that Dariana was very
[50:10] pleased with himself because he got this
[50:12] thing of Great Value he thought and he
[50:14] sold it for for
[50:16] um 500 to a stamp collector then that
[50:18] stamp collector sold it to another one
[50:20] for thousands of dollars and the value
[50:22] just kept going up and up and up of that
[50:24] stamp and the thing is that that stamp
[50:26] because it was such a rare stamp had a
[50:28] great value but none of them realized it
[50:31] but it was only the ones who were
[50:32] trained to look at the stamp realized it
[50:34] was of Great Value their boy had no idea
[50:36] it was worth probably thousands tens of
[50:38] thousands of dollars he thought it was
[50:40] just worth an ice cream you know so we'd
[50:42] never want to just you know
[50:44] put a very low value on this word we
[50:46] have on this message of the hour we
[50:48] don't ever want to just say it's well
[50:49] it's worth an ice cream you know this is
[50:51] worth more than an ice cream I mean this
[50:53] is eternal life it's like you know this
[50:55] Bible I can't remember how much it was
[50:56] bought for but the ink but the words in
[50:58] this book have eternal life in them you
[51:01] know it's more than just the value of
[51:02] the of the printed material but it's
[51:04] what's within it amen it's Priceless
[51:07] amen if you really have a revelation
[51:09] that the words of eternal life are in
[51:10] this word you won't trade it for nothing
[51:12] amen yeah but the thing is we'd ask the
[51:15] question why on Earth would a would a
[51:17] would a boy sell a stamp which is worth
[51:20] tens of thousands of dollars for an ice
[51:22] cream it wasn't his fault he didn't you
[51:25] know he wasn't a state you know he's
[51:26] just a boy he wanted ice cream as boys
[51:28] do and a lot of grown-up Boys still like
[51:30] ice cream but you see you know he had to
[51:33] he he didn't know the value of it and
[51:34] the reason he didn't know the value of
[51:36] it is because he wasn't taught the value
[51:37] and you know if if the parents really
[51:40] had a realization what was in their
[51:42] house they wouldn't have left it in the
[51:43] Attic they would have put it probably in
[51:45] a frame on the mantelpiece it would have
[51:46] been there probably their prized
[51:48] possession of a very rest amp and if it
[51:50] was placed in that position then then no
[51:53] doubt the boy you know he would have got
[51:54] to a certain age and you know because
[51:55] kids come to a point they first probably
[51:58] say no or please but then they say why
[52:00] you know they ask why why why why
[52:03] there's no ending to the why and because
[52:05] it's not an answer why you know and they
[52:07] said the boy would have looked at that
[52:08] stamp and said why is that there and
[52:10] they could have begun to tell him that
[52:11] stamp's Priceless it's the most valuable
[52:14] thing we have in this home is that stamp
[52:16] and then so he would never have taken it
[52:18] and traded it for an ice cream he would
[52:20] have left it there and said man we're
[52:21] really rich in that stamp there's a lot
[52:23] of value and it's the same thing with
[52:25] the word of God what value do we place
[52:26] on the message amen do we just put it in
[52:29] the Attic of our life and say well it's
[52:31] not really worth that much or is it on
[52:33] the mental piece of our heart say man
[52:34] where's the most valuable thing we have
[52:36] the word of God for this day that will
[52:38] transform our bodies take us up into
[52:40] heaven that's a very valuable thing we
[52:42] have in our possession amen we should
[52:44] never diminish the value of it amen but
[52:46] you've got to have the Revelation
[52:49] I pray you do that this that we have the
[52:52] pearl of great price we have the Lord
[52:54] Jesus Christ himself amen we have more
[52:57] than a philosophy more than just a
[52:58] movement or an idea or a religion but we
[53:01] have the very God of creation amen who
[53:04] knows our end in our beginning and where
[53:06] we're from and you know where we're
[53:07] going and who we are and you know he he
[53:09] made us and he's redeemed us on Calvary
[53:11] so we should Place him at the very
[53:13] highest value not something to argue
[53:15] about nothing you know yo this word is
[53:18] nothing to fuss over it's nothing to
[53:19] debate it's not you know that's not what
[53:20] it's about amen if you look at it just
[53:22] to that you haven't seen it as a pearl
[53:24] of great price you just got an idea to
[53:26] trade back and forth
[53:29] we want to take him as the pearl of
[53:30] great price now we understand that a
[53:33] pearl is an entrance it's a Gateway as
[53:36] as um John when he saw the you know New
[53:39] Jerusalem up you know up in glory he
[53:41] would see that the gates of that great
[53:42] city were Pearl it was a you know Pearl
[53:45] Pearl was the gates now we know that the
[53:47] that the you know every part of that
[53:49] city is is symbolic as the Book of
[53:51] Revelation is a book of symbols and so
[53:54] but a pearl you know you know there's a
[53:56] reason the gates are Gates of pearl
[53:57] because a a a pearl is an entrance into
[54:00] the city now we know a pearl is created
[54:03] when an irritant gets into an oyster or
[54:06] or a mollusk any kind of shellfish you
[54:08] know you can either either naturally and
[54:11] irritant or get in there or a human
[54:12] intervention will cause it to go in
[54:14] there then the oyster or the mollusk
[54:16] starts secreting a fluid in order to
[54:18] coat that irritant and it becomes the
[54:21] Pearl so as an irritation comes into the
[54:24] sea creature and that around it forms a
[54:27] pearl so it's an irritation causes this
[54:30] thing of Great Value to be formed now we
[54:32] need to look at our trials very
[54:34] differently amen our trials are not to
[54:36] break us our trials are not to destroy
[54:38] us our trials and our Temptations are
[54:40] actually not meant to ruin us but
[54:42] they're actually to create an entrance
[54:44] into the blessings of God and to the
[54:46] reality of Jesus Christ we know that
[54:48] there's no temptation it says in First
[54:50] Corinthians uh 10 and 13 there hath no
[54:53] temptation taking you such as common to
[54:55] man so basically whatever you're facing
[54:57] everyone else faces you know we're not
[54:59] special cases you know we sorry you know
[55:03] people do understand what you're going
[55:04] through because a lot of people have
[55:05] gone through it before you ever stepped
[55:07] into it
[55:08] amen but the thing is
[55:10] there's a difference between a Believer
[55:12] and an unbeliever an unbeliever sadly
[55:15] has no hope they have no way out they
[55:17] have a they don't have a higher strength
[55:20] hey man that could actually draw them
[55:22] out of a trial can actually give them
[55:23] strength in the trial they can they
[55:25] think it's just their human ability and
[55:27] how they can work out a way some shady
[55:28] deal or something to try and you know
[55:30] get out of a situation but a Believer
[55:32] has a way of Escape amen because he says
[55:35] now for there's no no temptation taking
[55:37] you as such as common to man but God is
[55:39] faithful he'll not suffer you to be
[55:42] tempted above that year Abel but with
[55:44] but will with the Temptation also give
[55:46] you a way of Escape that ye may be able
[55:49] to Bear it I mean so there is a way of
[55:51] escape the Lord gives amen that we can
[55:53] they were able to Bear any trial or
[55:56] temptation but we've got to look for
[55:57] that amen we can't just sit there with
[55:59] our blinkers on and say poor me while
[56:01] it's me and I'm going through this no
[56:02] God has allowed that to come into your
[56:04] life because he wants to make it an
[56:06] entrance into his power amen into His
[56:09] blessings into the reality of God that's
[56:10] why he's put trials in Temptation into
[56:12] your life praise the Lord
[56:14] Hallelujah why because it's a pearl it
[56:16] may be an irritant it may bug you and
[56:18] fix you amen but God is creating an
[56:20] entrance amen into his realities I'm so
[56:22] thankful God does that he's not a god of
[56:24] frustration or confusion amen but
[56:26] everything happens in life is for a
[56:27] purpose but we're going to look for that
[56:29] purpose amen we can't just look there
[56:31] with blinkers and be poor me and I've
[56:33] got trouble and what was me and pity
[56:34] party time take down the banner of the
[56:36] pity party no I mean this is a
[56:38] celebration of an entrance amen into the
[56:41] Eternal God hallelujah amen because so
[56:44] so we must think about these things it's
[56:46] time to rejoice in our trials because
[56:48] God is using them to create an entrance
[56:50] Into His blessings and power amen it's
[56:53] working for your good
[56:54] praise the Lord second Corinthians 4 and
[56:56] 17 for our light Affliction which is but
[56:59] for a moment worketh for us a farmer
[57:01] exceeding an eternal weight of Glory
[57:03] Hallelujah the Apostle Paul knew what it
[57:05] was like to have afflictions he was
[57:08] Shipwrecked he was beaten he was stoned
[57:10] he was thrown into prison more than once
[57:12] he was chased from City to City he had
[57:14] trouble with from without the church and
[57:16] within the church he had all kinds of
[57:17] things but he says it's just a light
[57:19] Affliction and it's working for a moment
[57:21] there's an expiry date on this trouble
[57:22] amen it's going to come to an end
[57:24] Hallelujah and it's working for me a far
[57:27] more exceeding Eternal weight of Glory
[57:28] Hallelujah if we could look at our
[57:30] trials as those things they're working
[57:31] for my benefit this is not for my
[57:34] destruction this is for amen my
[57:35] resurrection for my glory amen for my
[57:37] shaping amen that God would make me into
[57:40] His Image more and more holy how's your
[57:43] gate how's your entrance
[57:45] praise God Amen he says while we look
[57:48] not at the things which are seen But at
[57:50] the things which had not seen for the
[57:52] things which you've seen are temporal
[57:53] but the things which are not seen are
[57:55] Eternal amen so I pray we can look at
[57:57] look at these irritants in our life amen
[58:00] as an entrance a Gate's being formed
[58:03] Hallelujah
[58:05] praise God
[58:07] amen
[58:08] the real brother Brahm says the real
[58:10] gospel glows with power Eagles hear that
[58:13] I mean they don't look for a shine they
[58:15] look for a glow glowing with humility
[58:17] glowing with love glowing with power I
[58:20] mean that's what the real Eagle hunts
[58:22] they can't scratch in a barnyard and
[58:24] please him you'll never be able to do it
[58:25] they'll never you'll never tell it to
[58:27] him because he won't believe it but let
[58:30] that voice scream from Heaven I was he
[58:31] that was dead and alive again something
[58:33] takes place I am the same yesterday
[58:35] today and forever and it shall come to
[58:37] pass in the last days I'll pour out of
[58:39] myself upon All Flesh glory to God it'll
[58:42] Quicken your mortal language it'll
[58:43] quickly your mortal tongues
[58:46] um it'll give you the Eve I'll give you
[58:48] the evidence that I'm going to bring you
[58:49] in the resurrection with me hungry
[58:52] hearted Eagles reach that just as hard
[58:54] as they can it's the pearl of great
[58:56] price that they sell everything else to
[58:58] go by amen see a real a real Eagle a
[59:01] real child of God will look for the
[59:03] resurrection amen as that pearl of great
[59:05] price the resurrection and the life I
[59:07] mean we're not looking for a you know
[59:09] just a just a way of life we're not
[59:12] looking just for having nice Church
[59:13] community we're not looking for you know
[59:15] to have nice families only and those all
[59:17] those things are fine but the pearl of
[59:19] great price is the resurrection
[59:20] Hallelujah and that's what we look for
[59:22] are you looking for that amen if the
[59:25] Lord has revealed to you that in this
[59:26] word is the resurrection
[59:29] amen there's power in this word to
[59:31] transform you to take you from this
[59:32] world to the next amen it's like Jesus
[59:35] would tell of the story The you know
[59:37] that you know there's a certain rich man
[59:38] there's a bigger Lazarus the rich man
[59:40] you're both died the rich man went to
[59:42] hell the you know your your uh Lazarus
[59:45] the poor man went to Abraham's bosom and
[59:47] then so the rich man was being tormented
[59:49] in the flames and he saw afar off he saw
[59:52] he's he saw Lazarus the poor man in
[59:54] Abraham's bosom and he cries out to him
[59:56] you know cries out to Abraham Sin Sin
[59:58] Lazarus with a bit of water on the tip
[1:00:00] of his finger they can put on my tongue
[1:00:02] that I'll be you know you know you know
[1:00:03] I'll be um relieved or whatever because
[1:00:05] I'm being tormented in this flame and
[1:00:07] Abraham said there's a great Gulf
[1:00:09] between me and you you know he can't
[1:00:11] come to you you can't come to him and
[1:00:13] then he says Doug can can you please
[1:00:15] send send someone that can tell my
[1:00:18] family I've got family who are not dead
[1:00:20] and they're going to come to this place
[1:00:22] so they live the same kind of life as I
[1:00:23] lived I don't want them to come to this
[1:00:25] place
[1:00:26] and then and then Abraham says no they
[1:00:28] have the law and the prophets they won't
[1:00:30] believe you and if one is raised from
[1:00:31] the dead and what Jesus is saying is
[1:00:33] actually there's power in the word that
[1:00:35] they have already amen that if they
[1:00:37] believe it in faith they won't go to
[1:00:38] where that to destruction they'll go
[1:00:40] into life eternal that means if we could
[1:00:43] really put the value on the word that it
[1:00:45] does have eternal life in it amen it's
[1:00:47] more than just red and black ink on
[1:00:49] paper but there's really just like the
[1:00:50] message it's more the Kentucky and
[1:00:52] speaking more than healing lines and
[1:00:54] discernment and prophecy but it's God
[1:00:56] being made real Amos Jesus Christ
[1:00:58] revealed in that word amen Hallelujah
[1:01:02] now an entrance uh uh gives power
[1:01:06] amen so a door you know you know a
[1:01:08] doorway is always an entrance to
[1:01:09] something
[1:01:10] and as as um John would would be told to
[1:01:14] write in the Book of Revelation in your
[1:01:16] Revelation 3 and uh it's a it's a uh and
[1:01:21] to the angels of the church in in
[1:01:22] Philadelphia right these things saith he
[1:01:25] that is Holy he that is true he that
[1:01:27] hath the Key of David he that openeth
[1:01:29] and no man shutteth
[1:01:31] and Shadow of the no man open Earth I
[1:01:33] Know Thy Works behold I have set before
[1:01:35] then open door and no one can shut it
[1:01:37] for thou has a little strength and has
[1:01:39] kept my word and has not denied my name
[1:01:42] now we know that the Philadelphian age
[1:01:43] was the previous age but but but it laps
[1:01:46] over into this age and all the blessings
[1:01:48] of of all the Ages come down into the
[1:01:51] last stage and also all the cursings and
[1:01:52] the warnings come down to the last day
[1:01:54] just well and so this open door we know
[1:01:56] if you look at history there was a great
[1:01:58] missionary time in the Philadelphia
[1:01:59] Church age but it's a but but it's not
[1:02:02] just that because we know scripture has
[1:02:04] compound meaning but a door was going to
[1:02:06] be you know you know I've set before
[1:02:07] then open door so there's an entrance
[1:02:09] that's going to be opened up to the
[1:02:11] church and so brother Brown says now
[1:02:13] then we can see Jesus as the door
[1:02:15] he is the daughter of the sheep and
[1:02:17] notice that it speaks now
[1:02:19] um of the door opening what is that but
[1:02:22] a revelation of him and that Revelation
[1:02:24] is going is opening up to bring us
[1:02:26] strength to illuminate the word and to
[1:02:29] glorify his name it was in the midst of
[1:02:31] the last two ages of the revelation of
[1:02:33] the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out
[1:02:35] before us yes we knew he was God how
[1:02:38] else could he be
[1:02:39] um how else could he be our savior but
[1:02:41] to know that he was the only God or God
[1:02:43] Alone he was the Alpha and Omega
[1:02:46] that was that Jesus was both Lord and
[1:02:48] Christ make him the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:49] the Father the Son the Holy Ghost all
[1:02:51] one person that had been long lost since
[1:02:54] the first church ages but now we're
[1:02:55] seeing it again the revelation of who he
[1:02:58] was has come back and he got hit it's
[1:03:00] not a three-person god with one
[1:03:01] personality for it takes a personality
[1:03:03] to make a person but there is one
[1:03:05] personality there is but one person they
[1:03:08] who who believe in three persons have a
[1:03:11] three God godhead and are guilty of
[1:03:12] breaking the first commandment but the
[1:03:14] revelation of the godhead is back and
[1:03:16] now the true church can be built in
[1:03:18] strength again after all this time she
[1:03:20] finally knows who her Lord is once again
[1:03:22] we are baptizing in the name of the Lord
[1:03:24] Jesus Christ just as they did at
[1:03:27] Pentecost so so there's been a
[1:03:29] restoration of behold You Know Thy Lord
[1:03:33] as one God
[1:03:34] amen that yo yo because what's happened
[1:03:37] through history is they've taken a
[1:03:38] manifestation of God and make it a
[1:03:40] separate God Amen but we know that God
[1:03:42] is not one like your finger is one like
[1:03:44] brother Bram said because there's got
[1:03:46] your finger and there's one
[1:03:47] manifestation but God has different
[1:03:49] manifestations either Pillar of Fire
[1:03:51] He's A Cloud by day he appears as an
[1:03:54] angel how many of you know you know you
[1:03:56] know you know he came in a bodily form
[1:03:58] to Abraham there in Genesis 18 you know
[1:04:00] he came in different forms and he came
[1:04:02] in flesh Amen to redeem us Born Into the
[1:04:05] human race is our Kinsmen redeemer is
[1:04:07] the Lord Jesus Christ to redeem us back
[1:04:08] to himself and then he went back as
[1:04:10] being the pillar of fire again he is the
[1:04:12] Holy Ghost he's all these different
[1:04:13] forms amen but you see now this door is
[1:04:16] opening why is to that the church can be
[1:04:18] built in strength again
[1:04:20] that means it's very important we
[1:04:22] realize that we're being built in
[1:04:24] strength we're not being built in
[1:04:25] weakness and an unbelief but in faith
[1:04:27] and power of the Holy Ghost Amen to this
[1:04:30] this is what Revelation has come to do
[1:04:32] he's going to give us strength to
[1:04:33] illuminate the word and to glorify his
[1:04:35] name now we need a strength like we've
[1:04:38] never needed in this day amen because
[1:04:41] this is the darkest age he's ever been
[1:04:43] upon the earth I mean but it would as I
[1:04:45] would say in Deuteronomy 33 25 the
[1:04:47] second part of the verse it's a as thy
[1:04:50] day so shall thy strength be amen so so
[1:04:53] as the days are so shall your strength
[1:04:55] be so the darker the world is amen the
[1:04:58] more strength we have amen the lighter
[1:05:00] that you know so because remember guide
[1:05:02] away sins the power of His Holy Spirit
[1:05:03] to combat what the enemy has done and we
[1:05:06] know that the power of the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:08] always greater than what the enemy can
[1:05:10] do Hallelujah so we're not standing here
[1:05:12] useless or I mean faithless or unable or
[1:05:15] you know pushed back in a corner and
[1:05:17] we're just going to survive no we're not
[1:05:18] just going to survive we're going to
[1:05:19] overcome amen God is going to have a
[1:05:22] people upon the Earth he's going to show
[1:05:24] the power of his blood amen and a people
[1:05:26] and he's going to make a bunch of
[1:05:27] Overcomers and they're going to overcome
[1:05:29] this age and we are those Overcomers I
[1:05:31] mean we're part of their body right amen
[1:05:34] so because it's not our own strength
[1:05:35] that we would ever ever have our own
[1:05:37] mental ability amen that we could
[1:05:39] overcome it takes a supernatural
[1:05:41] strength to come into our lives by the
[1:05:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's how
[1:05:45] we can overcome amen when we we've got
[1:05:47] to master the thought of our own human
[1:05:48] ability when we realize we cannot do it
[1:05:51] but he must do it then it can be done
[1:05:53] but when we think we can do it it'll
[1:05:55] never be done we'll always be here buddy
[1:05:58] I hit against a brick wall getting
[1:05:59] nowhere but we realize we can't do it
[1:06:01] Lord you must come and do it then he can
[1:06:02] do it Hallelujah
[1:06:04] amen so we don't need physical strength
[1:06:07] we need spiritual strength we need Faith
[1:06:09] muscles I mean that's why this door of
[1:06:11] Revelation has opened up now we know any
[1:06:14] Revelation is just a revealing of what's
[1:06:16] already here
[1:06:17] amen that's that scriptural Revelation
[1:06:19] is an opening of the word amen where
[1:06:21] it's been sitting there for thousands of
[1:06:22] years but God comes and makes it live
[1:06:24] praise the Lord so you know so so this
[1:06:27] is what this door of Revelation this
[1:06:28] opening I mean causes us that he's going
[1:06:32] to give us strength
[1:06:33] and I believe even if you say you're
[1:06:35] weak let the weak say they are strong
[1:06:38] have a good confession about yourself
[1:06:40] I'm more than an overcomer I mean I can
[1:06:42] do all things through Christ which
[1:06:43] strengthens me amen he's redeeming by
[1:06:46] his blood I am his workmanship I made it
[1:06:48] his image amen I've been washed in his
[1:06:50] blood I'm without spot or wrinkle or any
[1:06:52] such thing because of what he has done
[1:06:54] for me amen don't confess what you think
[1:06:56] about yourself confess what he has done
[1:06:58] for you that's all that will stand is
[1:07:00] our confession what he has done for you
[1:07:01] because when you confess what he has
[1:07:03] done for you then the power of that
[1:07:04] confession comes into your life and it
[1:07:06] manifests Hallelujah
[1:07:09] oh really is that true well Joshua and
[1:07:11] Caleb said let's go take the land he's
[1:07:12] given it to us they took the land
[1:07:14] amen the others confess we can't take it
[1:07:16] they didn't take it have a positive
[1:07:18] confession
[1:07:20] Hallelujah so as our days are so shall
[1:07:23] thy strength be amen so we're strong
[1:07:24] people the Lord is our strength the joy
[1:07:27] of the Lord is our strength that's why
[1:07:29] we should never be unhappy in the Lord
[1:07:31] we should be happy
[1:07:32] doesn't matter what's going on in life
[1:07:34] that's that's nothing to do with it
[1:07:37] you say well actually no it has a lot to
[1:07:39] it makes me feel down with Paul and
[1:07:40] Silas were in a prison they're beating
[1:07:42] in stocks in the inner prison they
[1:07:43] didn't look at the stocks and the
[1:07:45] beatings and the pain they just begin to
[1:07:46] sing
[1:07:47] I live because the joy of the Lord was
[1:07:49] their strength and God shake the place
[1:07:51] set them free and then and and and met
[1:07:53] the Philippian Jailer and all you know
[1:07:54] all those things happen why because they
[1:07:56] didn't look at their circumstances they
[1:07:58] looked to the one who is leading them
[1:08:00] was that amen
[1:08:02] praise the Lord we're gonna look to the
[1:08:03] one who's leading us amen now as he said
[1:08:06] to illuminate the word now illuminate
[1:08:09] means to Enlighten spiritually or
[1:08:11] intellectually let's just forget
[1:08:12] intellectual bit because not our brains
[1:08:14] that are being stimulated a member
[1:08:16] Speedy spiritually enlightened Amen to
[1:08:18] make his word More Alive to us amen
[1:08:22] because you know as as brother Ryan
[1:08:24] would say I'm putting on the whole armor
[1:08:25] of God he'd say now God just brings his
[1:08:27] word more positive all the time he don't
[1:08:30] have to refortify it and bring something
[1:08:31] else up he just makes his word more real
[1:08:34] all the time and the Bible says when the
[1:08:36] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[1:08:37] of God raises the standard against it
[1:08:39] now that now if the enemy comes like a
[1:08:41] flood God's fortification to his people
[1:08:43] to fortify them as the word of God and
[1:08:46] he just raises the word a standard
[1:08:48] against him
[1:08:49] amen so he makes his word more real all
[1:08:52] the time he says he doesn't have to
[1:08:53] re-fortify us we have the fortification
[1:08:55] but it's the value you put upon the
[1:08:57] fortification that matters amen so so he
[1:09:00] what does he do he makes his word more
[1:09:02] positive all the time that's why the
[1:09:04] promises of God maybe Years Gone by
[1:09:06] we're trying to grasp and say how can
[1:09:07] this be and how's this going to work but
[1:09:09] now he's fast forward to 2023 and we say
[1:09:11] amen that's true it's here hallelujah
[1:09:14] you know the promises are just become
[1:09:15] more positive all the time
[1:09:17] Hallelujah what is that Illuminating his
[1:09:21] word to you you know it's like you could
[1:09:23] read a scripture 99 times it couldn't be
[1:09:25] nothing to you but the hundredth time it
[1:09:27] just it's like wow I never saw that
[1:09:28] before but you have seen it before but
[1:09:31] not spiritually seen it was that God
[1:09:32] illuminates the scripture for your
[1:09:34] present need I'm so glad he does that
[1:09:36] don't you amen his word is our source of
[1:09:38] strength now don't turn off on me I mean
[1:09:40] we're going to get somewhere okay if
[1:09:42] you've got to stand up and wake up we'll
[1:09:43] do that you know but you know you know
[1:09:45] the Lord he he gives us strength through
[1:09:48] by Illuminating his word
[1:09:50] amen he wants to make his promises more
[1:09:52] alive the Rapture is more real now than
[1:09:54] it was when we first believed amen the
[1:09:57] other power of healing of the holy ghost
[1:09:59] moving of spiritual gifts of the
[1:10:01] restoration of the power of God Amen
[1:10:03] where we are in history becomes has more
[1:10:05] is more real today amen being the bride
[1:10:08] of Christ is more real today than when
[1:10:10] we first believe what he's illuma a door
[1:10:12] is opened amen it's more than just God
[1:10:14] sent a prophet now it turns from the
[1:10:16] prophet to the prophecy amen and the
[1:10:18] prophecy is the bride adorned in the
[1:10:20] word of God I mean a people that match
[1:10:22] him amen Made In His Image Hallelujah
[1:10:26] Hallelujah isn't that right amen and
[1:10:29] what what every promise is becoming more
[1:10:31] alive was that God is Illuminating his
[1:10:34] word
[1:10:36] hallelujah amen that's why it's so
[1:10:38] important read the Bible listen to the
[1:10:40] message amen pray and you'll find the
[1:10:42] quotes from the scriptures become more
[1:10:44] alive to you
[1:10:45] Hallelujah
[1:10:47] was that God Illuminating his word to
[1:10:49] you when he does that amen and it's to
[1:10:51] glorify his name because how can how can
[1:10:54] Illuminating his word and how can giving
[1:10:56] strength not glorify his name it doesn't
[1:10:58] glorify the one he's been strengthened
[1:11:00] no it glorifies the one who gave the
[1:11:02] strength it glorifies the one who gave
[1:11:04] the Revelation it's not well I know
[1:11:06] everything look at me I've got it all
[1:11:07] together because I worked it out if
[1:11:09] you've worked it all out you've got one
[1:11:10] thing wrong that you think you're right
[1:11:13] right no you're going to realize no he's
[1:11:15] the one who gives Revelation it's not
[1:11:17] our ability to put quotes and scriptures
[1:11:18] together that'll get us in a Rapture no
[1:11:20] it's walking with him it's knowing him
[1:11:22] he'll lead us and guide us into all
[1:11:24] truth amen so we've got to say how can I
[1:11:27] not glorify his name you know you look
[1:11:28] at the promises of the scripture amen
[1:11:30] just of healing
[1:11:32] you know of the gifts you know your
[1:11:34] healing and different things the
[1:11:35] supernatural power of God you go back a
[1:11:37] hundred years or just over 100 years
[1:11:39] those things were just a longing for the
[1:11:41] church and but then Azusa Street broker
[1:11:43] then the restoration of the word
[1:11:45] happened even through the ministry of
[1:11:46] brother Brown and all these things were
[1:11:48] just things that people wanted and now
[1:11:50] we live in the season of it Hallelujah
[1:11:53] so how could it not bring bring Glory
[1:11:55] upon you know you know across our lips
[1:11:57] of his blessed name and how great he is
[1:11:59] because remember it's really you know
[1:12:02] you know the parable says that the
[1:12:03] merchant man found the Pearl but really
[1:12:04] the Pearl finds you amen the pearl of
[1:12:07] great price found you it's not you
[1:12:09] finding God do you think I'm seeking
[1:12:11] after God no God's seeking you amen
[1:12:13] that's why the reason you have a hunger
[1:12:15] is because he put that hunger in you
[1:12:16] because he wants to draw you to himself
[1:12:18] I think I think his brother Isaac said
[1:12:20] yo yo no man can come to unless my
[1:12:22] father draws him so if you have a
[1:12:24] longing it's the father drawing you holy
[1:12:27] you're a blessed person to have that
[1:12:28] kind of feeling
[1:12:29] what's More Than A Feeling Just better
[1:12:31] burden along it'll say that's the Deep
[1:12:33] calling to the Deep amen and if there's
[1:12:35] a hunger in you for God there's a God to
[1:12:37] respond amen and he's the Lord Jesus
[1:12:39] Christ Hallelujah so so we see God
[1:12:42] fulfill his word in this hour the third
[1:12:44] pull and manifestation how can we not
[1:12:45] glorify his name
[1:12:47] Hallelujah
[1:12:49] amen now the treasure in the field now
[1:12:51] uh you know I was reading this I think
[1:12:53] it was strange
[1:12:55] um
[1:12:56] why wouldn't why wouldn't they why
[1:12:58] wouldn't Jesus say when he found the
[1:13:00] treasure he just he just took the
[1:13:01] treasure
[1:13:02] but it says he bought the field
[1:13:05] now yeah you think it's odd because
[1:13:07] normally if you find a treasure oh yeah
[1:13:09] I'll just take that with me and off I go
[1:13:10] but but he says that he that he sold all
[1:13:14] that he had I mean no
[1:13:16] and so and when he had found he hideth
[1:13:18] and for joither of God and South all
[1:13:21] that he had that he buy at that field
[1:13:23] so so he leaves the treasure in the
[1:13:25] field but he buys the field to get the
[1:13:27] treasure now normally you just think
[1:13:28] well you just steal the treasure and
[1:13:30] it's yours but no he had to buy the
[1:13:31] field
[1:13:32] to get the treasure
[1:13:34] now there's a there's a um saying that
[1:13:37] one man's trash is another man's
[1:13:39] treasure
[1:13:39] once again it's value what value do you
[1:13:42] put upon it right someone can have a you
[1:13:44] know like there's um
[1:13:46] uh you know there's a show my parents
[1:13:48] used to watch a lot Antiques Roadshow
[1:13:49] you know people would take an antique or
[1:13:51] something for you know take it to these
[1:13:52] experts and they would value it and you
[1:13:54] know and some people walk in with this
[1:13:56] thing doesn't look like much but it was
[1:13:58] worth thousands and thousands of pounds
[1:14:00] you know it was worth a lot because but
[1:14:02] but but the value that the person bought
[1:14:04] you know
[1:14:05] yeah the person who owned at the valley
[1:14:07] they put on it was way less than the
[1:14:09] value of the expert and maybe I thought
[1:14:11] this is just a trinket this is just some
[1:14:13] dumb old painting or some funny vars
[1:14:15] that you know but no it was worth a lot
[1:14:17] of money and so so one man's trash is
[1:14:19] another man's treasure some of those
[1:14:21] things they picked up at flea markets or
[1:14:23] you know garage sales whatever more but
[1:14:25] they're worth a lot of money why because
[1:14:27] one's man's trash another man's treasure
[1:14:29] so it's all about the value that you put
[1:14:31] upon it now there's treasure in the
[1:14:33] field so the reason
[1:14:35] the reason that the that that Jesus is
[1:14:37] saying you've got to buy the field where
[1:14:39] the treasure is it's because so then
[1:14:42] there's no more dispute about the
[1:14:44] treasure because if someone's just found
[1:14:47] with a treasure it's potentially just
[1:14:49] stolen goods
[1:14:51] where'd you get that from in that field
[1:14:53] you stole it give it back right but if
[1:14:56] you say where'd you get that treasure in
[1:14:57] that field whose field is it mine well
[1:14:58] it's yours right so so the field must be
[1:15:03] bought in order that there's no dispute
[1:15:05] on the treasure
[1:15:06] now Lord Jesus made it very clear that
[1:15:09] his field was bought now I'm going to
[1:15:12] get into this a little bit now now and
[1:15:14] in the Old Testament
[1:15:16] one of the first or maybe the first uh
[1:15:19] times when a piece of land is bought is
[1:15:22] when Abraham would buy a parcel of
[1:15:25] ground to bury his wife in
[1:15:27] now he would go to the um
[1:15:29] he would he would go to the sons of
[1:15:31] Heath and now the children of Heath is
[1:15:33] in the promised land and and and he
[1:15:36] talked with them and said no I want to
[1:15:37] buy a field you know my wife has died I
[1:15:39] want to buy a cave for her to be buried
[1:15:40] in and they were willing to give him the
[1:15:43] cave of Mac Pella just because of who
[1:15:46] Abraham was but God was showing
[1:15:48] something through Abraham you know and
[1:15:50] saying no no you can't give it to me I
[1:15:52] want to buy I must buy it that there's
[1:15:54] no dispute that this burying ground is
[1:15:56] mine and you know they Define the
[1:15:58] borders you can go read about it and
[1:15:59] Genesis 23 and you know what's the full
[1:16:02] price you know they you know you know
[1:16:04] they had a they had a negotiation going
[1:16:06] on you know I wanna I want the defined
[1:16:08] borders of this field and I want the
[1:16:11] price of the field and you can't give it
[1:16:12] to me I want to buy it now the devil was
[1:16:15] going to give all the kingdoms of the
[1:16:16] world to Jesus one day he says no you
[1:16:19] can't give it to me I'm gonna buy it
[1:16:20] amen that now that comes now there's no
[1:16:23] dispute amen when I dethron you and I
[1:16:25] take on my Throne I mean there's no
[1:16:27] dispute thing that belongs to you
[1:16:28] because I bought the whole world Amen
[1:16:30] that's what our lord Jesus did he bought
[1:16:32] the whole world Hallelujah that down
[1:16:34] Calvary his blood came upon the Earth to
[1:16:37] purchase not only you and I but this
[1:16:38] whole whole earth back to Adam's Fallen
[1:16:40] race amen so so Abraham would buy this
[1:16:43] buy this film that had the cave of
[1:16:45] macpeller in it he paid the price and it
[1:16:48] became his possession for a burying
[1:16:50] place for his loved ones and so his
[1:16:53] beloved wife was was buried there in
[1:16:56] that cave
[1:16:58] Hallelujah and so now now this is a
[1:17:01] field
[1:17:02] now
[1:17:04] a lot of people as I've said and I'm
[1:17:06] kind of repeating myself I really want
[1:17:07] this to stick a lot of people think this
[1:17:08] is a good philosophy to live by it makes
[1:17:10] nice people being a Christian is just
[1:17:13] you know you know we have we have nice
[1:17:15] fellowship and everyone's friendly and
[1:17:17] you know the message just gives me Bible
[1:17:18] truth and it's a nice thing to believe
[1:17:20] and you know the Miracles are amazing to
[1:17:23] hear
[1:17:24] but no there's something within the
[1:17:26] field of the word
[1:17:27] there's a burying place there's the
[1:17:30] burying place within the field of the
[1:17:31] word amen that is the place we want amen
[1:17:34] it can be a very nice place but it's the
[1:17:37] bearing place I mean because now Abraham
[1:17:40] was was spiritual remember remember when
[1:17:42] he was there in the promised land he met
[1:17:44] he met the king of the New Jerusalem he
[1:17:46] met Melchizedek and then and then when
[1:17:49] he met God he just had a confession I'm
[1:17:51] a I'm a Sojourner in this land sure it's
[1:17:53] been promised to me but I'm just a
[1:17:54] pilgrim I'm looking for a city and maybe
[1:17:56] if someone say well are you looking for
[1:17:58] Damascus or Hebron are you looking for
[1:17:59] maybe uh maybe Cairo if it was called
[1:18:02] that in that day you know whatever the
[1:18:04] capital of Egypt was or some great big
[1:18:06] city he says no no I'm looking for a
[1:18:07] different city well where is it is it is
[1:18:09] it here on no it's here
[1:18:11] and you'd look around there's just
[1:18:13] fields and it's a there's a river and
[1:18:14] then where's this where's the city all
[1:18:17] right it's going to come down it's going
[1:18:19] to come down on the spot how do you know
[1:18:21] I met the king of that City Hallelujah
[1:18:23] so he knew he had a revelation the
[1:18:25] resurrection was going to take place in
[1:18:27] that field take place in that land and
[1:18:30] that's why Joseph Joseph told told the
[1:18:34] Israelites he said don't bury don't
[1:18:36] leave my bones here in in Egypt sure he
[1:18:38] could have had probably one of the
[1:18:39] greatest tombs ever made was would have
[1:18:41] been for Joseph but he didn't want to be
[1:18:43] buried in a nice tomb in the world in
[1:18:45] Egypt he would be buried in the promised
[1:18:47] land because in the promised land a
[1:18:49] resurrection was going to take place
[1:18:52] so I was very a bit why because he saw
[1:18:54] more than just a nice land he saw
[1:18:56] there's actually in the Slanders the
[1:18:58] resurrection I trust that you see in the
[1:19:00] land of the word of the message there's
[1:19:03] Resurrection in this land that I trust
[1:19:06] has been quickened to your soul there's
[1:19:07] a resurrection in this word there's a
[1:19:09] body change in this word amen it's more
[1:19:11] than just nice ideas and quotes and
[1:19:13] things to live by but there's a
[1:19:14] resurrection in this field
[1:19:16] Hallelujah
[1:19:18] amen Ruth would Ruth was a mile bite
[1:19:21] she would she would come into a field
[1:19:23] one day amen we know the story where
[1:19:26] where where Naomi and her husband and
[1:19:28] two sons they
[1:19:29] they left they left the promised land
[1:19:31] they went into Moab because of a famine
[1:19:33] now this is just me now now we know
[1:19:36] everything had to work out for Nomi to
[1:19:37] come in right but if you look at her on
[1:19:40] one hand if they had a revelation that
[1:19:41] the resurrection was going to happen
[1:19:43] there they would never have left the
[1:19:44] land it doesn't matter how bad it got
[1:19:46] how hard things got how much food they
[1:19:48] didn't have I mean I realized no Moab
[1:19:50] may be a good land but the resurrection
[1:19:52] is not there it's here in this field
[1:19:54] amen and people I believe if they if
[1:19:57] they really had a revelation it doesn't
[1:19:59] matter what Storms Come What persecution
[1:20:01] comes what Trouble Comes what trial
[1:20:03] comes we're not leaving this word for
[1:20:05] nothing
[1:20:06] there's a resurrection in this world I
[1:20:08] mean in this field is a resurrection
[1:20:10] Hallelujah
[1:20:12] so so she would she would marry one of
[1:20:14] Naomi's sons and but of course we know
[1:20:16] sadly that you know Naomi's um
[1:20:19] husband died her two sons die and then
[1:20:21] and then Ruth and then offer which is
[1:20:23] the other daughter-in-law you know um
[1:20:25] they're there were through Umi says I'm
[1:20:28] going to go back to Israel because I had
[1:20:30] his grain there again there's food and
[1:20:32] um Naomi tells her daughters-in-law just
[1:20:35] stay here
[1:20:36] there's no point coming home with me you
[1:20:38] just stay here and offer offer you know
[1:20:41] whipped and she went back home but Naomi
[1:20:44] said I mean sorry Ruth said to know me
[1:20:46] I'm gonna go with you
[1:20:48] where your people are will be my people
[1:20:50] your God will be my God where you die
[1:20:52] I'll die
[1:20:54] she was being brought into a field
[1:20:56] Hallelujah now what's amazing about this
[1:20:59] is that
[1:21:00] is that it says in the law now maybe
[1:21:03] jumping around a bit
[1:21:05] but in the law now
[1:21:07] it says an ammonite or a moabite shall
[1:21:10] not enter into the congregation of the
[1:21:11] Lord even to their 10th Generation shall
[1:21:14] they not enter into the congregation of
[1:21:15] the Lord forever so the law said they
[1:21:17] weren't allowed in they weren't welcome
[1:21:20] but if there's a desire in a human heart
[1:21:22] Grace will overshadow the law and make a
[1:21:25] way every time Hallelujah so so the law
[1:21:28] said she wasn't allowed in but Grace
[1:21:31] overshadowed that law in the form of
[1:21:33] Boaz amen and brought her into the
[1:21:35] lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:21:37] amen and that's what I love about our
[1:21:39] lord Jesus is it sure there's the law
[1:21:41] saying we're condemned we're worthy of
[1:21:42] hell we're gonna but Grace overshadows
[1:21:44] the law
[1:21:45] Hallelujah when we needed a Kinsmen just
[1:21:49] like she needed a Kinsman she needed a
[1:21:50] boa she needed an Israelite to redeem
[1:21:52] her having to bring her into the
[1:21:54] covenants of Israel I mean so we needed
[1:21:56] a Kinsmen Redeemer to come and redeem us
[1:21:58] back to God doesn't matter how good we
[1:22:00] think we're hell how holy we think we
[1:22:02] are we needed someone to come from Glory
[1:22:04] I mean without someone coming amen we'd
[1:22:07] be lost amen because remember we're all
[1:22:09] born and born by sex born lost amen but
[1:22:13] so so one had to be born to the human
[1:22:15] race created in the womb of Mary as a
[1:22:18] human being to redeem us back to God and
[1:22:19] only God could be the one who's who has
[1:22:22] made there amen amen because why the
[1:22:24] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:22:25] amen so Grace law required a substitute
[1:22:30] required a you know the penalty paid and
[1:22:32] Grace met the requirement
[1:22:34] and our Lord Jesus Christ brother Graham
[1:22:36] says this he says in the breach message
[1:22:38] and God create required a Kinsmen
[1:22:40] Redeemer and he must be a human oh my
[1:22:43] what are we going to do now law required
[1:22:45] a kinsman redeemer now we couldn't take
[1:22:48] an angel he he had to have a man because
[1:22:50] we're not kin to the angel we're kin to
[1:22:52] one another the angel never fell he's a
[1:22:55] different kind of a being got a
[1:22:56] different body he never sinned or
[1:22:57] nothing he's different but the law
[1:22:59] required a kensan redeemer and every man
[1:23:01] on Earth was born of sex now don't you
[1:23:04] see where it come from oh that's where
[1:23:06] sin started you see where it's at now
[1:23:08] where he comes you'll see to The Serpent
[1:23:10] and see now notice required a kinsman
[1:23:12] redeemer a redeemer a kinsman redeemer
[1:23:14] must be born of the human race here that
[1:23:17] leaves us out on a limb but let me sound
[1:23:19] a trumpet to you the Virgin birth
[1:23:21] produced a product amen the Virgin birth
[1:23:24] produced our kinsman redeemer none other
[1:23:26] than the almighty God became Emmanuel
[1:23:28] one of us Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer
[1:23:30] was met you see how God makes a
[1:23:32] requirement and there's nothing we can
[1:23:34] do but then Grace steps in and
[1:23:36] overshadows that law and produces the
[1:23:39] product amen hallelujah so the law said
[1:23:42] she wasn't allowed in but Grace
[1:23:44] overshadowed that law but why is that
[1:23:46] because you sound she found herself in a
[1:23:48] certain field
[1:23:50] it wasn't just any field in Israel it
[1:23:52] wasn't just any field around Bethlehem
[1:23:54] but it was boaz's field the Mighty Man
[1:23:57] of wealth it was his field so Grace
[1:23:59] brought her into into his field now sure
[1:24:03] there was food in that field there was
[1:24:05] grain in that field so there was there
[1:24:07] was something to survive by but the
[1:24:09] treasure in the field wasn't the grain
[1:24:11] to Ruth the treasure in the field was
[1:24:14] Boaz himself I mean that was the pearl
[1:24:16] of great price to her amen because when
[1:24:19] Grace stepped in in the form of Boaz to
[1:24:21] Ruth amen it changed Hallelujah it
[1:24:25] changed
[1:24:26] it changed her that her identity of
[1:24:29] being a moabite was gone and her
[1:24:31] identity was now found in him
[1:24:33] Amy because remember gray steps in not
[1:24:35] because of who we think we are or our
[1:24:38] current state our current state is
[1:24:40] irrelevant you may be hurting you may be
[1:24:42] bleeding on the inside you may be broken
[1:24:44] you may be lost you maybe have a million
[1:24:46] questions that don't matter to God I
[1:24:48] mean that doesn't hold you that doesn't
[1:24:50] separate you one bit from the grace of
[1:24:52] God no it's not our current state that
[1:24:56] doesn't that doesn't hold us back gray
[1:24:58] steps in because we have a desire
[1:25:02] remember Ruth had a desire know me your
[1:25:04] God will be my God your people will be
[1:25:07] my people will your die I'm gonna die
[1:25:09] she had a desire
[1:25:11] amen and Grace stepped in and met that
[1:25:13] desire so if you ever hunger for God
[1:25:15] this morning God's here to meet that
[1:25:17] desire
[1:25:18] Hallelujah
[1:25:20] now we're going to understand that
[1:25:23] she had more than just now a good a good
[1:25:26] land to live in
[1:25:27] Hallelujah
[1:25:28] there's a lot in this field I know I'm
[1:25:30] probably repeating the same thing but I
[1:25:32] I just want God to Anchor it into our
[1:25:34] hearts there's a resurrection in this
[1:25:36] land and this message is a body change
[1:25:38] Hallelujah so so here she comes in I
[1:25:41] mean she becomes Mrs Boaz of Bethlehem
[1:25:44] amen now the promised land was and and
[1:25:47] then she was buried in that Promised
[1:25:49] Land right now the promised land was a
[1:25:51] good land it flowed with milk and honey
[1:25:53] that was a good place to raise family
[1:25:55] plant Vineyards farm the land have
[1:25:57] cattle sheeps and goats but it's so much
[1:25:59] more than that amen it was there was a
[1:26:01] resurrection in that field or that land
[1:26:03] that's really all that mattered amen
[1:26:06] because there's a resurrection in that
[1:26:08] place now now Boaz would tell Ruth
[1:26:12] he would say Do not glean in another
[1:26:14] field neither go from hence but abide
[1:26:17] here fast by my maidens so Boaz is
[1:26:20] telling for the lord of the Harvest is
[1:26:22] telling her himself don't go to other
[1:26:24] fields don't go into a different kind of
[1:26:26] way stay in this field of the message I
[1:26:29] mean stay in the word of the son of man
[1:26:31] don't don't go off into some
[1:26:33] Presbyterian Catholic Roman Catholic
[1:26:35] idea some of the new age thing stay in
[1:26:37] the field of the word
[1:26:39] I mean stay in there that's where it's
[1:26:41] Commander don't go out and glean
[1:26:43] anything else stay here and get your
[1:26:45] food your spiritual food
[1:26:47] amen and you know
[1:26:49] Brother Brad was saying here she was
[1:26:51] gleaning behind picking up these little
[1:26:52] greens and the lord of the Harvest fell
[1:26:54] in love with her her being an alien what
[1:26:56] a picture my I just love that and then
[1:26:58] he said whose dams was this and they
[1:27:01] begin to speak and say it is a moabite
[1:27:03] who come and with know me and he went
[1:27:05] out to her and spoke peace to her and
[1:27:07] said don't you leave this field God be
[1:27:09] merciles stay put don't be tossed about
[1:27:11] every wind of Doctrine stay in the word
[1:27:13] amen it's like Jesus would say when he'd
[1:27:16] say in in in John 8 and 31 then said
[1:27:19] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[1:27:21] him if ye continue in my word then you
[1:27:24] are my disciples indeed now that word
[1:27:26] continue means such a verb it's a doing
[1:27:28] word it means to stay it means to abide
[1:27:31] it means to dwell it means to endure to
[1:27:35] be present to remain
[1:27:36] I mean to stand so he says if you
[1:27:39] continue so if you dwell if you abide in
[1:27:42] my word if you endure in my workers
[1:27:45] tribulations troubles are going to try
[1:27:46] and push you out of the field amen but
[1:27:48] if you stay if you be present if you
[1:27:50] remain then you are my disciples indeed
[1:27:53] right but it's more than just saying
[1:27:54] yeah but but there's a blessing that
[1:27:56] comes with this right and you shall know
[1:27:58] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:28:00] free amen so now now we know the truth
[1:28:03] is not just a collection of ideas right
[1:28:06] it's not just some evidence that points
[1:28:07] to a conclusion oh that's true no the
[1:28:10] truth is a person Jesus said I am the
[1:28:12] way the truth and the life amen so you
[1:28:15] shall know the truth in other words
[1:28:16] you'll become one with the truth I mean
[1:28:18] I'm going to join myself too like Boaz
[1:28:20] joined himself to root they were married
[1:28:22] amen so you shall know the truth you'll
[1:28:24] be intimately you shall intimately know
[1:28:26] the truth you're going to intimately
[1:28:28] know the Lord Jesus Christ and his word
[1:28:30] you know his heart you know his desires
[1:28:31] and what there's a power now in him to
[1:28:34] make you free see it's not us that frees
[1:28:36] our ourselves now you shall know the
[1:28:38] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:28:40] so if you abide in his word amen the
[1:28:43] truth shall make you free if you remain
[1:28:45] in his word the truth will make you free
[1:28:47] if you dwell in it the truth will make
[1:28:49] you free what there's a power in the
[1:28:51] truth to free us from every entanglement
[1:28:54] every snare every trouble from the devil
[1:28:56] every mind battle every complex there's
[1:28:58] power in the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:29:00] looseness of all those things
[1:29:02] I assume the sun is set free is free
[1:29:04] indeed Hallelujah that's why he says
[1:29:06] abide in the word stay in the field
[1:29:08] don't don't go looking up on specialty
[1:29:10] doctrines and eighth Messengers and all
[1:29:12] kind of nonsense no just stay in the
[1:29:14] field of the of the word
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:18] Hallelujah so it's very important but
[1:29:19] you see now
[1:29:21] this res there's Resurrection in that
[1:29:23] land in the Promised Land
[1:29:25] see some people just become believers
[1:29:27] they see a land flowing with milk and
[1:29:29] honey of revelation of true Bible
[1:29:31] Doctrine the mystery of God revealed see
[1:29:34] this land of the word will produce
[1:29:36] genuine Bible believing Christians it'll
[1:29:39] produce real families it'll produce real
[1:29:41] fathers mothers real young people
[1:29:43] amen people say okay so I'm not sure
[1:29:46] that's fine
[1:29:47] just say in the word and you'll see it
[1:29:49] produce it right you'll see it really
[1:29:51] transform your life if you let them
[1:29:53] transform you he'll transform you I mean
[1:29:55] into the image of his word but there's
[1:29:57] so much more to it than that see the
[1:30:00] treasure in the hidden treasure in the
[1:30:02] field is the rapture it's the
[1:30:03] resurrection Hallelujah that's that's
[1:30:06] the treasure in the message is a body
[1:30:08] change
[1:30:09] hallelujah it's more than just good
[1:30:11] quotes and good families and good church
[1:30:13] and good preaching good singing good
[1:30:14] whatever good young people all those
[1:30:16] things are great and I appreciate them
[1:30:18] but there's a resurrection in this land
[1:30:19] I mean there's a resurrection in this
[1:30:22] message
[1:30:23] Hallelujah
[1:30:25] amen brother man was saying in Exodus
[1:30:27] let's forget Joseph that I mentioned
[1:30:29] before when he died years later Jacob
[1:30:31] was taken back bird with Abraham Joseph
[1:30:33] and when he died he said don't bury my
[1:30:35] bones down here why take my bones when
[1:30:37] you go out bury them in the promised
[1:30:39] land why he knew that there was a
[1:30:41] resurrection the first fruits of the
[1:30:43] Resurrection that Jesus was coming and
[1:30:45] when he come and they did it for him and
[1:30:47] they said and then on Easter morning
[1:30:48] when he arose up to Matthew 27 the Bible
[1:30:51] said that many of the bodies of the
[1:30:53] saints that slept in the dust I mean of
[1:30:56] the Earth come out of the graves of the
[1:30:57] resurrection and entered into Glory with
[1:30:59] him who was it Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:31:01] amen they were spiritual they had
[1:31:04] discernment that they knowed that the
[1:31:05] resurrection was not going to take place
[1:31:07] down in Egypt it was going to take place
[1:31:09] in the promised land and Brethren
[1:31:11] tonight I know that from leaving the
[1:31:13] Baptist Church so forth I got a lot of
[1:31:15] criticism and so forth by seeing the
[1:31:17] spiritual meaning of the coming of the
[1:31:18] Lord for those who are in Christ will
[1:31:20] God bring with them at the resurrection
[1:31:22] you can have all your Fanatics you want
[1:31:24] and have all your big denominations but
[1:31:25] bear me in Christ for them that are in
[1:31:28] Christ God will bring with them at the
[1:31:30] resurrection amen bury me in Christ
[1:31:32] don't bury me in a church philosophy
[1:31:34] don't bury me in a religion or even just
[1:31:37] a bunch of quotes bear me in the
[1:31:38] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:31:41] amen that's exactly where we need to be
[1:31:43] buried
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:45] because Joseph had her Joseph had a
[1:31:48] revelation that Messiah was going to
[1:31:50] stand in that Promised Land one day
[1:31:51] Hallelujah that's why and if people had
[1:31:54] a revelation of this word that there was
[1:31:56] that Messiah is in this word that Jesus
[1:31:59] Christ is revealed in this message amen
[1:32:01] they would never leave it if they see us
[1:32:03] Messiah revealed amen that the message
[1:32:05] reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture
[1:32:07] that it wouldn't bother anyone about you
[1:32:10] know doesn't matter about storms and all
[1:32:12] the stuff see the mess is not about
[1:32:13] brother Branham it's about Jesus Christ
[1:32:15] revealed through him and when you get
[1:32:18] that Revelation doesn't matter what the
[1:32:19] storms come trials persecution you'll
[1:32:21] never leave the word because you see
[1:32:22] it's Jesus Christ there but you see
[1:32:25] unfortunately a lot of people are you
[1:32:27] know some people are like the half tribe
[1:32:29] of manassar and Gad and Reuben they
[1:32:30] settled on the wrong side of the Jordan
[1:32:32] River
[1:32:33] amen they they were coming up to the
[1:32:35] Jordan and the numbers 32 it says the
[1:32:38] children of Reuben and the children of
[1:32:39] GAD had a very great multitude of cattle
[1:32:41] and when they saw that land oh of Jesus
[1:32:44] which is on the east side of Jordan and
[1:32:46] the land of Gilead that behold the place
[1:32:48] was a place for cattle it says in verse
[1:32:51] 5 wherefore they said if we have found
[1:32:53] Grace in thy sight let this land be
[1:32:55] given to thy servants for a possession
[1:32:57] and bring us not over Jordan
[1:32:59] so it's amazing when you think about it
[1:33:02] they'd come right to the Borderland
[1:33:05] remember the the resurrection and type
[1:33:08] is in the Promised Land but yet because
[1:33:11] they had so many cattle
[1:33:13] they thought this place is perfect for
[1:33:15] what we've brought with us
[1:33:17] to me it you know
[1:33:19] it's crazy when you think about it
[1:33:22] that they were so close
[1:33:24] but yet the things they brought with
[1:33:26] them kept them out of the land you know
[1:33:29] if for me if I was them and and you know
[1:33:32] I was given an inheritance that that it
[1:33:34] wasn't
[1:33:34] um for cattle I'd rather shoot the
[1:33:37] cattle sell the cattle or get rid of the
[1:33:38] kettle you know whatever thing that I
[1:33:40] brought with me out of Egypt I wouldn't
[1:33:42] want that hindering me from crossing the
[1:33:44] Jordan amen where it's malice or Pride
[1:33:47] or something you know you know people
[1:33:48] people have a pride in what they used to
[1:33:50] be that's got to die
[1:33:51] or some kind of forgiveness you know
[1:33:53] some kind of bad attitude religious
[1:33:55] ideas Traditions justifying yourself or
[1:33:58] justifying besetting sins that are
[1:34:00] stopping you from Crossing Jordan amen
[1:34:02] never say well I'll just dwell right
[1:34:04] here on the east side of Jordan that's
[1:34:05] the wrong place to settle down because
[1:34:07] there's no Resurrection on the wrong
[1:34:09] side of Jordan I mean there's you know
[1:34:11] sadly there's no part there's no Rapture
[1:34:14] on the wrong side of Jordan you've ever
[1:34:15] come you've got to Cross Jordan amen now
[1:34:18] we know Jordan represents a death to
[1:34:19] self
[1:34:20] where you really die out to your old
[1:34:22] self and your old ways and what you used
[1:34:24] to be and you truly are born again your
[1:34:26] Nature's changed I mean you've you know
[1:34:28] you have a skeptical you know um way of
[1:34:31] thinking about the word and you need all
[1:34:33] this different you know you're skeptical
[1:34:35] unbelief way of thinking but then when
[1:34:36] you really die out to that and faith
[1:34:38] comes in what you become a new creature
[1:34:39] in Christ when the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:34:41] and transforms you what's that you've
[1:34:43] crossed Jordan you're in the Promised
[1:34:44] Land
[1:34:45] and it's amazing when you when you read
[1:34:47] about this you know that that that Moses
[1:34:50] says that you're basically you're doing
[1:34:51] the same sin that the ten spies did that
[1:34:53] they said we couldn't take the land
[1:34:55] by by settling down on the wrong side of
[1:34:58] Jordan
[1:34:59] what is it is unbelief actually kept
[1:35:01] them out of the land
[1:35:02] and now if you read the rest of this
[1:35:05] they are told by Moses that you have to
[1:35:07] go fight with the rest of the children
[1:35:09] of Israel that you'll get that they'll
[1:35:10] get their inheritance
[1:35:12] so people can come to church they can
[1:35:16] sing they can preach they can play they
[1:35:19] can pray they can be a witness they can
[1:35:21] they can you know do all kinds of things
[1:35:24] but yet they're still on the wrong side
[1:35:25] of Jordan
[1:35:26] and they will fight and help all the
[1:35:28] rest of the Bride take their inheritance
[1:35:30] in the promised land but yet they're
[1:35:32] still out of it because this is what
[1:35:34] they did
[1:35:35] because I said because Moses said you
[1:35:36] got to go on before everyone and you've
[1:35:38] got to fight that everyone else will
[1:35:39] take their inheritance but they're on
[1:35:40] the wrong side of Jordan see we don't
[1:35:42] want to just be part of a church
[1:35:45] and receive blessings
[1:35:46] you know the Holy Ghost comes down we
[1:35:49] get blessed Wednesday and Sunday
[1:35:50] Wherever We Gather we don't just want to
[1:35:52] be part of a church like they'd be on
[1:35:54] the wrong side of Jordan we want to come
[1:35:56] in and meet the Lord that's not just
[1:35:59] that that we're not just living off
[1:36:00] external blessings but it's now an
[1:36:02] internal blessing that is well of Living
[1:36:04] Waters flows out of us the Holy Ghost
[1:36:06] amen that changes our nature that we're
[1:36:09] not just living and looking in and just
[1:36:10] besetting sins and things hold us back
[1:36:12] and but no no we've sold out we've burnt
[1:36:15] every bridge remember the one who saw
[1:36:17] the treasure in that field sold all that
[1:36:20] he had to get the field just like the
[1:36:22] pearl of great price sold all that he
[1:36:23] had to get that Pearl amen so the things
[1:36:26] you hold as Treasures in your heart
[1:36:27] you're willing just to sell it all
[1:36:29] to take the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:33] amen we don't just want to be around the
[1:36:35] message we don't just want to be a part
[1:36:37] of the church Amy we want to be part of
[1:36:40] the Lord
[1:36:41] amen that the message is not just
[1:36:42] something that we listen to it's within
[1:36:44] us the Lord Jesus Christ is within us
[1:36:46] himself
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:49] so whatever you do friends don't let
[1:36:50] anything keep you out of the Promised
[1:36:52] Land
[1:36:53] well I've got a Life to Live I've got
[1:36:55] things I want to do meet the Lord he'll
[1:36:57] give you five greater things to do and
[1:36:59] there won't be any regret with those
[1:37:00] things there won't be any I wish I never
[1:37:02] did that there won't be any regrets
[1:37:04] Hallelujah
[1:37:06] isn't that right we you know we want to
[1:37:07] cross the Jordan if you have you should
[1:37:09] just be praise God he's revealed to me
[1:37:12] there's a resurrection in this land and
[1:37:13] the reason he reveals it to you is
[1:37:15] because you're part of the Resurrection
[1:37:16] amen Ruth probably didn't she had no
[1:37:18] idea that you know she just found
[1:37:20] herself in a field but then Grace found
[1:37:21] her in that field as like us you know we
[1:37:24] maybe stumble into a meeting heard the
[1:37:26] message somewhere maybe even growing up
[1:37:28] in it but one day Grace Finds Us in that
[1:37:30] state amen and and God quickens himself
[1:37:33] to us he becomes alive to us changes us
[1:37:35] forever
[1:37:36] what happens amen we've seen this
[1:37:39] Resurrection in the land
[1:37:40] in this field
[1:37:43] Hallelujah
[1:37:45] praise the Lord
[1:37:48] why are you saying all this

[1:37:57] our special meetings and this is
[1:37:58] happening and no you got to know him
[1:38:01] you got to know him you've got to hear
[1:38:03] the voice behind the voice and realize
[1:38:05] that it's not brother Brandon preaching
[1:38:07] sure this is Humanity but God has been
[1:38:09] forget about the man speaking it's Jesus
[1:38:11] Christ being revealed through that man I
[1:38:13] mean he said yo people say well I don't
[1:38:15] know 16 people who ever wrote this book
[1:38:16] oh it's man it's been translated
[1:38:18] hundreds of times look beyond that
[1:38:20] God protects his word if God is his word
[1:38:23] he will protect his word that every
[1:38:25] generation will have a true
[1:38:27] translation of his word
[1:38:29] amen so we're going to look beyond that
[1:38:31] and say actually no this is a pearl of
[1:38:34] great price
[1:38:35] I had a lot of philosophies just be a
[1:38:37] good person be a good you know we should
[1:38:39] never just raise our children just to be
[1:38:41] good
[1:38:42] this message is not just being out be
[1:38:44] quiet shut up sit here eat this dress
[1:38:46] this do this do that that's not what
[1:38:48] being a Believer is we don't just raise
[1:38:51] our children to be good people if you're
[1:38:53] majoring on those things you've missed
[1:38:54] the whole Vision actually the vision is
[1:38:57] children
[1:38:58] the Lord found us
[1:39:00] Hallelujah he lives in us he found us
[1:39:03] one day I was in darkness now I'm in
[1:39:05] light he found me amen I was in this
[1:39:07] field of the world and I found this
[1:39:08] pearl of great price I found this
[1:39:10] treasure amen's mother it's worth more
[1:39:12] than gold and riches and careers and
[1:39:14] whatever more it's going to take me to
[1:39:16] Heaven it's him in this place amen that
[1:39:18] he found me that's what we should be
[1:39:20] majoring on our God is real he's not
[1:39:22] dead his promise is a true even though
[1:39:25] time should carry his promises are still
[1:39:27] true snap out of just looking at Natural
[1:39:29] Things and look at the spiritual oh look
[1:39:32] at that that's how we should be Jesus
[1:39:35] found us well what about the rest of the
[1:39:37] world well I'm just happy I'm in and
[1:39:38] Lord it'd make me a influence that the
[1:39:40] rest of the world can come in
[1:39:42] because people think well it's not fair
[1:39:44] well actually where are you
[1:39:46] God found me
[1:39:48] I was a drunk Universe issued 34 Craig
[1:39:50] Road in Christchurch I was in that house
[1:39:51] he found me in that house not looking
[1:39:53] for him but he found me there I'm just
[1:39:54] glad he found me I'm still glad he found
[1:39:57] me we should feel the same way he found
[1:39:59] me he became a living reality

[1:40:25] light
[1:40:27] or well how do you do that Lord show me
[1:40:29] your heart and your word
[1:40:32] and then Lord give me the spirit that
[1:40:34] wrote the word put it in me that I can
[1:40:36] read the word
[1:40:37] and then you look at a different light
[1:40:39] and say
[1:40:40] this is an entrance
[1:40:43] the Lord has given me a way to walk into
[1:40:44] a Heavenly land
[1:40:46] hallelujah hallelujah and not just not
[1:40:49] just you but then potentially everyone
[1:40:51] around you
[1:40:53] because because Abraham had a lot of
[1:40:55] people coming with him
[1:40:57] he had a lot of cattle he had a lot of
[1:40:59] servants he armed them and he killed
[1:41:01] some armies

[1:41:10] such an influence he says now we're
[1:41:12] traveling here everyone else just went
[1:41:13] with them all of his servants went with
[1:41:16] why because he had an influence upon his
[1:41:18] life that was now being projected to the
[1:41:20] servants everything it may have been
[1:41:21] only his promise but it still went upon
[1:41:23] them and they got a blessing he said
[1:41:25] well not everyone's bride that's fine
[1:41:26] but Salvation is for whosoever will amen
[1:41:29] I'd rather have a church full of Saved
[1:41:31] people
[1:41:32] than no one
[1:41:35] praise the Lord if people get eternal
[1:41:36] life for the great wife or judgment
[1:41:37] praise God hallelujah I'd rather help
[1:41:40] someone just one step up the ladder then
[1:41:42] not at all
[1:41:44] say Amen but if you have that Revelation
[1:41:47] in your heart that you've got the pearl
