amen thank you amen God bless you all can can you turn this thank you yeah just think both of them amen it's good to have Brother Joseph here too God bless you welcome amen if um just like you you got your Bibles handy let's just go to um go to the Book of Revelation chapter 13 just want to read one verse here it's Revelations 13 and: 8 I want to um let's just read the word and we'll we'll go into our study the speaking of the Beast and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated now I want to you know last Wednesday we uh went into a bit of a Bible study about walking in the light and I want to um I want to continue continue on our on our just our bit of a study here about what is what is happening in this end time because we understand that there's so many things have happened in this day and it's very important that we recognize what's happened in this day because you know just just the scripture alone that we read You Know There's 7 billion people upon the Earth and it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so that's it's a lot of people and then but then you may probably think well how can it be so because people are not the whole world is not Satanist or outwardly Satanist you know there's all these Christian churches there's all kinds of religions so how is it that you know all would worship Him whose name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life and we're just going to go into this a little bit just to just see how the Lord leads uh because this is the this is the age where Satan is enthroned as God of this world Amen so I just want to um let's just go to Genesis we're going to go to the start of Genesis and we'll just see how we how we how this leads but um I want to show you that it's it's very simple and brother Brandon makes a very simple statement he says anything that is against the word is Antichrist amen he just very simple anything against the word is Antichrist amen so if anything is is against what the Bible is teaching it is against God even though it may use scripture it may say Jesus died on the cross for you it may use crosses it may all the terminology we speak about Redemption and the blood and you know all the you know they it it may use all those terminologies but anything that is against the word is Antichrist okay so I just want to show you this um this principle if we go to Genesis chapter 3 I know this is very familiar but I just want to show you because if we can see how the devil Works Through the Bible you can see what he's doing today CU he is a he is a creature of habit that's right you know he doesn't he doesn't actually there's nothing new Under the Sun it may change what it looks like but it's the same thing so we're going to so we go to Genesis chapter 3 and we'll go to verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it least ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God doth know then the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil now how how how how how the devil used the serpent now to attack to attack Eve is the same way he attacks you it's the same way he attacks the church it's the same way he you know the same the same way and simply what he did is he made he made Eve believe a lie which was 99% truth and it took her out of the protection of the truth of God's word because God simply said to them if you if you eat of this tree that day you'll die so therefore don't eat of that tree don't partake of that tree and you'll be fine that's all they had to do but then so so the devil was able to punch through that protection and get her to believe 99% truth but it was just just that mising of that one word caused all of this Calamity that we see around us as the the world was fallen so what so what he did now is he as he bypassed he he he he he didn't speak to Adam about this but he went straight to the woman so he went straight to the church amen he didn't he didn't go and you know he didn't go and speak to Adam and then Eve didn't go speak to Adam about it she just took what he said because it sounded scriptural yep so she didn't say well what does the Bible say about it or you say what does the message say she just took what he said because it sounded very cuz he was using he was using Bible terms eating of the tree being as God's you know they already were gods they had dominion over the Earth amen yep they had Dominion so what she was promising what he was promising her was actually they already were gods and but then but what he did was you know it's very simple she got he got her to step out of what the Bible said and to believe a lie and that's what caused the fall cuz it had to actually she had to agree with it first in her mind and then the Act was done I mean so sin was you know first it was sin is always conceived in the mind first and then you then the person has to agree with what's in the mind and then they go do it amen yeah and and then you can take that every facet of life it has to be agreed with in the mind and then then the person agrees with it then they go do it yeah so you know you can take that into anything that's you know anything that that's wrong amen and and and and that's the principle he will come and reason because he said y hath God said did he really say that did he really mean what he said you know so so he came with reasoning now I'm going slow cuz I want to go slow cuz I really if you can catch what the devil does here you'll sure catch what he tries to do to you yep so so he came with reasoning did God really say that that's what yeath God Said means did he really say that are you sure he really said what he said are you sure that that's actually chapter and verse what he meant and so but then we see what happens is now the woman actually she begin to actually believe the devil's lie because what what Satan did and this is what he comes and always does is remember in Genesis chapter 1 it says God made heavens and the Earth but then when man begins to come into the picture it says and the Lord God made now we read this and we just think well it's God and and it is God but those English words there's a reason it's written that way and so Capital you know Capital God that just means Elohim or the self-existing one so just something that self exists but then the Lord God is actually is is Jehovah God the one who expresses himself or the one who has relationship with that's what it means so he was a self-existing one but then now he put his children upon the Earth and then he changed now and now he was the Lord God that had relationship amen he want you know he is having relationship with his children and then so the serpent comes along and she and he actually takes Eve back to what God was in I'd say a previous time because he wasn't just a self-existing one anymore he was the one who has relationship he's a God who expresses himself so the serpent took Eve back to what God used to be yeah and then so the devil will come along to you and he'll say no no God is how he was maybe 2,000 years ago he's just a god of History amen he's not a god of today he's just a god of History he's just a god of 1965 or he's just a god of when you first met him sometime he's not the same today he'll come and use the same tactic against you oh he's just a god of my parents because they met him back sometime that's what he'll do he'll try and get you to believe he's not the same today as he was yesterday and shall be forever amen and and that's exactly what the serpent did and so she believed that now God was just this big self-existing one who was some distant God someplace and then he just misconstrued that that word to her because if if she really said no the Lord God had said this then maybe the devil would have got a bit scared because if it's the Lord God it means I'm actually in relationship with him I mean he's not some distant God somewhere actually no maybe I'll just asking myself that's right amen but she actually believed the kind of God that the serpent was preaching yeah so it wasn't actually the first one upon the Earth that wasn't God that preached was actually the serpent amen yeah yeah you've probably this is probably very elentary but I just want you to see he preached the word first to Eve there's no record of you know they would Adam and Eve would have had Fellowship about it but there's no record of actually Adam preaching to eve even though he probably would have but you see it's recorded in the scripture the serpent came along and preached the first sermon yeah is this okay you understand he came along this said this is what the word means and instead of her going well maybe I should read the Bible about and actually just wait cuz it says they that wait upon the Lord don't be Hasting in just grabbing something just just wait upon Him amen if the you know you if if if anything's presented in life wait upon the Lord amen nothing there's nothing wrong with being a bit slow about things when it comes to the things of the Lord amen where where something comes in life and directions want to be changed just wait upon him don't be Hasty and grab it just wait amen and then so now she so that's how the devil got her yeah and then now if we continue to let's just go to Genesis chapter 4 and then we're going to go to a 11 and then we're going to go jump into the Book of Revelation now Genesis chapter 4 we won't read it but to save time there's can and abble and there's the pro you know and it says that you know um you know there came the time that that that that you know Abel was a keeper of the sheep and Cain was a tiller of the ground and the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord and Abel also brought a firstling of the flock and they and they worshiped you I know you've heard these stories many times but we see now here comes here comes the seed of the serpent now and then the son of son of Adam the Son of God here and they come to worship now they're going to have church and Hebrews 11 says that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain so Cain's sacrifice was actually very good amen he was sincere he was you know he was dedicated but only Abel had the Revelation that was blood yeah only Abel had that Revelation Cain didn't have that Revelation Cain brought his own ability cuz you know you know you make a garden you know if you have Lambs if you have sheep you don't really need to do a lot with them as long as they've got grass they can just have grass but a garden you got to get the weeds out you got to plant the seed you got to water it you know you got to look after it as it grows and so so Cain brought the efforts of his own ability and then he presented that to God God look at what I I've done look how many Bible verses I've memorized look how many times I go to church look how much I pray list you know you know and those things are all good we should do those things but if you if you bring that to God as some kind of bargaining chip or some brownie Point look I got another badge God you owe me God doesn't ow anything he's a sovereign God it's only in his Mercy does he ever act on our behalf amen amen but but now so so he brought he brought his own abilities and then Abel didn't bring his own abilities he had a revelation that was a lamb in the garden that was killed and the clothed with the Skins then knew it was a blood s in the garden the prophet says and then so so they came with their offerings and God accepted one and God rejected one yeah and this happens in every age all the way down through there's there's the true and the false all the way down through and they both bring an offering they both believe in God Amen they both believe you know Cain genuinely believed in God he was not an atheist he believed in God but he was not his offering was not accepted but it's amazing because when God there's no record of you know in the scripture you read you read Genesis 4 there's no record of God ever speaking to Abel but God speaks to Cain because God gives everyone an opportunity anyone who's sincere here the truth will always come across their path amen and it's what they do with it that's up to them that's why you just go fishing and you know and and it's up to them amen and so and we should go fishing amen and so now and so God just says to Cain basically just do what your brother did and you'll be accepted so in other words you don't need to even understand what you're doing just do it yeah but it but it wasn't in him to do it so now what happens is you have Abel here who's accept Cain's rejected and then Cain kills Abel so Cain tries to force his religion upon Abel yeah and because Cain cannot be accepted by giving fruit he has to destroy the true one in order to be hey we're the true church yeah so he enforces his beliefs you must believe it my way and if you don't I'll kill you and he did yeah and then you take that all the way from the garden and then you can bring it all the way we're going to go to the book Book of Revelation and you know and it's all oh no wait let's go to I no I'll just mention it to save time and then and then you and then the next B if we you know but the same time we won't read it is as you see the Tower of Babel that was a forced worship they had to conform they had to worship a certain way so it was now what Cain did but on a massive scale amen you have to we have to build this Tower we have to be one and and they enforce the people to worship this one way which is totally and wrong yep that's a to and then of course we know God confus the languages and um and Scattered the people upon the face of the Earth that's why Babel means a confusion now so that is the principle now the devil tells a lie that sounds like scripture that's right gets you to believe it and it always ends up in death cuz that's what happened the day you of the day you shall die and by believing 99% truth and 1% error it brought death into the human race that's why the prophet says if if if that caused us to fall out of Eden how is 99% truth going to get us back into Eden that's not it takes 100% truth it takes a Vindicator thus sayith the Lord you must worship Him in spirit and in truth yeah and so and then and then and then the Cano kills Abel so the false always persecutes the true to try and destroy the true to say we're the you know to to actually say now we're the true church cuz there's no one else and then you see that you see that's why Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees he said you garnish the tombs in other words you you build up the tombs you make big memorials and you make you know all kinds of holidays about the prophets that have come down but it says by doing that you prove that you are of your your fathers put them in the tombs cuz they always say well if we're in the days of Moses or Isaiah we would have believed them but but their very actions of of ignoring what God was doing but yet garnishing the tombs of what had happened proved that they were they were not they would not have received that prophet's message if they lived in that day amen y because what happened is the prophet came along and he was now he was like Abel he's saying this is the truth this is the lamb and then the false ones always killed the true because they couldn't take the message that they were preaching am just like Cain could not take Abel's message and then it becomes a force religion that's why in Jesus's day if if anyone went to the meetings of Jesus they would have been kicked out of the synagogue that's why many were secret Believers and so it was now a forcing up you upon the people don't you listen to this man you listen to your priest yeah it was a forced you know you had to either choose be be and remember in in in Jewish Society it's not like New Zealand and how you can just go to church and not go to church and go to this church and disappear it doesn't matter what religion you had if you were kicked out of a synagogue you were ostracized from from the entire Community because the whole village went to the synagogue that's right amen the synagogue was a central you know that worship was a central part of their life yeah so you couldn't just disappear and go change religions you know there's massive and you can even see it in in many societies today like over in the islands you know you can't just you can't just change church this no your village goes to this church you have to go to this one it's a Mass's family pressure yeah it's not like this here but it is over there and that's how it was in the days of Jesus and so there was a force you had to you had to stay in the synagogue you know you had to basically lose all to go follow Jesus it's the same thing today but it's just changed how it operates now that's actually sorry let's go to um um I want to go to actually Daniel chapter 7 and I want to read some scripture and then we'll go back to Revelations chapter 13 now we got a Daniel chapter 7:1 now Daniel with these beasts we're going to read about it speaks of the world power until the time of the end okay and then we're going to pick it up in Revelations chapter 13 So Daniel sees a vision until the end time and he sees from Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom down all the way to this Beast that was very diverse you know uh from from you know of of all of them and this was the anointing now on the world system you know all the way down to the end so when it speaks about this kind of Beast it's actually the anointing that is on the world's power at the the time okay these things are all symbolic so and I just want to show you the um yeah let's just let's just read this whole piece here in the first year of B Shazer King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and vision of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold Four Winds of Heaven strove upon the Great Sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another the first was like a lion and had Eagle's Wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given under it and behold another Beast a second like a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus uh unto it arise devour much flesh after this I beheld in low another like a leopard that had upon the back of it four wings of a foul the Beast ALS uh had also four heads and Dominion was given unto it and after this I saw on the night visions uh uh and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth at devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue at the feet of it and it was diverse from from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns now it was now this this Beast this this fourth Beast here which is actually the Roman the first one was the world Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar which is the first Beast that came up the second one was the world Empire of the of the mes and Persians then the four and then the third one was was the Greeks and then this fourth one that we read about that Daniel couldn't he couldn't describe it properly like it was a be like a bear or a leopard or something this was the Roman World Empire and so now the reason it was it was diverse from all the other beasts is because all the all the anointings WR the first three are actually combining into the last one because you know when whenever a country invades another the culture of the country that they take over is absorbed into the into the Victor's culture yep so whenever one of these Empires conquered the other this one was absorbed into it and it actually changed the the one who conquered it yeah you see like you know you when Alexander the Great you know he took Babylon and then and then the whole Greek culture was changed because now they begin to adopt Babylonian ways you can just go read about it in history and then it's the same when the Romans took the Greeks over Greek thought and everything was now absorbed into the Roman Empire and so that's why it's it it was diversed from all the Beast is because these first three powers now were absorbed on to the fourth and then and then let's just read let's just read verse 8 and N I considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there was first three there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things and I beheld till the ancient uh until the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as a burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him 10,000 times 10,000 ministered unto him and and sorry thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open and I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and giv to The Burning Flame so this goes all the way from from when when Rome was here and that same power goes all the way down it says until the a until the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit so that's when the kingdoms of man become the kingdoms of God where where the where the world kingdoms are done away with and Jesus Christ sets up his kingdom upon the Earth amen because when a throne is cast down that means the king the ruler is cast down that kingdom is cast down and so the Thrones were cast down means now there comes a time where the world powers have come to the end and now God's kingdom is upon the Earth again yeah and then when God's kingdom is established then now then this where the where the where the um we just read about the Thousand Times thousand ministered unto him then the 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him and the books were open the Judgment was set that's the great white Throne judgment and we know after the great white Throne judgment then there's a lake of fire and everything that is not of God is thrown to the Lake of Fire that's why it says now his body was destroyed and given to the Burning Flame yeah so this so this so this world power now that we with the thing is just Rome and many many Christians they just they just look back oh that was Rome but they forget that that same power is still here today yeah that same power is still here today and then we're going to go to Revelation 13 because John sees literally you know um he he he sees the same the the same Beast powers that Daniel saw okay so we go to Revelations 13 and verse one now this power uh so so this Beast that comes out here now is the same one as the fourth Beast that we read about in in Daniel chapter 7 it's the same one because you see here and I stood upon the sand of the sea and and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having remember a sea is multitudes peoples you know it's people great population of people that's what the sea represents having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy so this is this is actually more of a um detailed description than what Daniel saw because he didn't have a name of blasphemy before now how do you have a name of blasphemy it's like there was a there's another part of scripture you know brother and preaches a sermon Blasphemous names and in in the in the Book of Revelation and off the top of my head I'm not sure what the scriptures but I think it's Revelation 17 how she had all the names of blasphemy it's actually uh the the true interpretation as it is Blasphemous names so it's blaspheming God so how can you have a name that blasphemes God is that you is that you appear to be for God but you're actually against him but yet you quote scripture you you you talk about Easter and you talk about the cross and you say Jesus loves you but then if you're if you're teaching something wrong just like remember the serpent that's the reason I brought that out cuz the serpent preached the falsehood to even it brought death but yet he used scripture it wasn't the whole truth but he used most of the truth and then that's the devil's system all the way down to especially today as he'll give 99% truth quoted from here but there's that lie that he injects in and it brings death it doesn't bring life it doesn't produce this in a people amen it doesn't produce the life of the word in the people it produces whatever the system is that's why Catholics bring forth Catholics methodists bring forth meth you you Methodist Baptist Baptist pres Presbyterian Presbyterian Hill song Hill song whatever you want to whatever label or whatever religion they preach that's what they produce in the people but if the truth is produced it will produce Jesus Christ in the people amen and that's what we want don't you want to see Jesus in you hallelujah amen so the word the truth of the word will produce Jesus Christ in you okay so to have a name of blasphemy is actually now this is actually now a religious power it's always political but it's also a religious power and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard remember we read about a leopard and everything in in Daniel chapter 7 and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet as it were a feet of a beer and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority now this word Dragon we think of a big scaly reptile that that that that breathes fire but the true the true uh if you look at the definition of the of dragon it means like a fabulous enemy you know a great enemy doesn't mean a big scaly guy it means an incredible enemy you know you know a fabulous enemy and but now the dragon we know is Satan so now Satan is giving his power he giving all of his power to this Beast to do what it wants to do so this is now a satanic move to to control the world now and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and the deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now that was we understand when when the Roman world was coming to an end then team was coming to A great battle and he had a dream he and and he saw a cross he says with this sign under this sign you will conquer and he told all of his soldiers paint a cross on your Shields and they won the day and then what he did is he is in order to stabilize his his kingdom he he he United paganism with Christianity and it and it and it brought stability to the Empire so it changed from the what we think of the Roman Empire now to not not the Roman Empire with the legion is and things but it's now a Papal Empire it's now a religious Empire yeah because what other church has embassies around the world Catholic church has got embassies you look and you look at when the um you know you go back to the days of the Reformation medieval days who who literally ran the countries it wasn't just the king there was the Cardinal that's right amen who wasn't you know he was like the prime minister in many of the countries the French Revolution was they call it like an anti-roman move they're trying to get rid of the Catholic control of the country amen Henry VII had to get rid of his Cardinal you know to try and do what he had to do because remember this Beast is a polit it's religious but it's political so there's always a wherever the Catholic church is it's not just a religious thing there's a political motivation behind it so so back in the day when when during the Dark Ages it was really the Cardinal of the Catholic church he was really the power behind the king amen and he was influencing the king not to help the king but to help Rome yeah so it changed so you'd say well you know and then so it changed from the Roman Empire now to the Roman Catholic church but that is the power to the time of the End Amen you know you know I don't have it on me but you see Vietnam why the war in Vietnam arm happened the Catholic stirred it up you've heard about the Roman Catholic Holocaust in the Balkans after World War II how they how they it was the how they was it Yugoslavia there's the Roman Catholic part there's the Roman Orthodox part and the Roman Catholic part persecuted the the Roman Catholic part persecuted the Orthodox part and they murdered hundreds of thousands of people and it was and but but if you looked at it was like a fascist state but all of the what would happen is the is the Roman Catholic ministers would take off their robes put on their military uniforms and they'd be the ones in charge of all the pal military people that's true I you I'll yeah I'll send you a link and so but this was all done so it was a so the the Catholic church has engineered for Wars to happen you can see the Crusades let's go take the hly land back back well who started that war it was the Catholic Church everyone knows that it's just history and what about the Crusade you know and it wasn't just Crusades into the holy land they were up into like Lithuania those kind of places amen Catholic Church went into South America they did all butchered the whole place yeah but it was for political gain but they used religion now to stir the people up to get to to to get what they wanted to happen to happen and that's why when the pope speaks everyone listens everyone listens and they wondered and and they worshiped the dragon who gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like under the Beast and who is able to make war with him who can make war you know if the pope said you know just like in World War II if the pope had Catholic stopped fighting that would have been an end yeah it would have been absolute in you know you know the not this Pope a few previous ones he he scolded America and the U you know you all these nations that that South America the Catholic nations in South America they owed money to America and other places and he told off these ones that were holding the debt over these other countries he said you shouldn't hold this debt and he told them off and then so what they did all these other countries forgave millions of dollars worth of debt why because he is you know he doesn't have an army he doesn't need an army that's right amen he just needs to say a few words and the whole world changes yeah but I'm going to hopefully have enough time cuz we're going to go well you say that's religion we're going to go into remember there's Two Babylons who knows there's Two Babylons yeah and so remember it's all of control just like Cain I have to destroy Abel so I can control the whole thing Tower of Babel I must build Babel so I can control the whole world yeah y so now Satan has engineered it in such a way that he wants to control the whole world and he needs a vehicle to do it now who was able to make war with the Beast okay let's just stop there no no let's keep going and there was get onto him a mouth speaking great things and bless me and power was given unto him to continue 4 and2 months and he opened his mouth in the uh and blasphemy against God to blasphemy his name and his and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them now this is actually now in the Great Tribulation where the fullish Virgin are there cuz this to continue 4 and2 months I think that's 3 and 1/2 years yeah I might be wrong maybe I can't add but I think that's 3 and A2 years okay so now during this three and a half years where he's got supreme control that's when he makes war with the Saints and he overcomes them and you can see this in Daniel chapter 7 where it says and the kingdom was given to the Saints of the high it says after that but that this Beast made war with the Saints the most high and overcame them but then there's a judgment then the kingdom was given to the Saints well how does this work where one's just given the kingdom but then in the next verse it says the Beast overcomes them then then there's judgment then they given the kingdom that's because one is the wise virgin that has the oil that get given the kingdom and the others the fullest verg that gets overcome by the enemy and then after the Judgment they given the kingdom yeah because a saint means a Sanctified one yeah so the so the wise and foolish virgins they're all Sanctified but one one really knows the Lord they have the oil the others don't have the oil but they're both Sanctified so God has been working their lives but only one group really knows him they're the ones that go on the Rapture amen and all that dwell sorry and there was given unto him to make war with the Saints okay now let's go verse eight and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain them from the foundation of the world if any man Heaven ear let him here and he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity and he that kth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and faith of the Saints now I want to go to Revelations chapter 18 just to cuz I want to um we'll come back to Revelations 13 another time but I want to show you here in Revelations 18 that there's Two Babylons and when brother baram prophesied that California was going to slide into the sea it's already in the scripture yep but what happens is now a prophet will pick up a prophecy actually say Now's the Time it's going to happen am yeah so so when he when he said it's going to slide into the sea it's already in Revelations 18 here yep so now let's read let's read from verse one and then we're going to just read down to verse four then we're going to jump down to verse 9 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven now after these things well what does that mean it means after Revelation 17 and Revelation 17 is is the Catholic is is the mother of harlots being identified so after she's been fully identified then what happens after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and now that is actually the ministry because an angel is not always a Heavenly being it's actually it's also a messenger so now now this is actually the prophet's Ministry because it was so great the whole earth was lightened with its Glory yeah and he cried mly with a strong voice saying Babylon the great has fallen has fallen and as has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached up into heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities so now so now this is this is the hour because because even even the Seventh Day Adventist they say they can go to Revelation 17 and say the Catholic church is the mother of harlots but they forget to be a mother you've got to have children so if she's a denomination then her children will be denomination yeah so they're actually stuck in the same cage she is is but they don't know it yeah and that's why there's the call come out of her my people it's not just Catholicism but all the religious systems come out of her my peoples that's why there's a call now that has gone into the earth now and it's called people out of out of out of churches out of denomination and what happens is those people don't normally want to leave the church they want to fix the church they're in but what happens is because that religious spirit's there they don't want to change and you can see it all the way through you can go into even even the early you know before the Reformation you know John whitecliffe who the first one or one of the first ones to translate the Bible into English in the 13 what 1400s and then his writings but then the Catholic Church wanted to to try him as a heretic they didn't like what he was doing but he wanted to fix the church he was in and then his teachings influenced John hus in Bohemia and then John hus was a a Catholic priest but he didn't want to start a new church he wanted to fix the Catholic church but the Catholic Church didn't want to change so they burned him at a burned him at the Stak as a heretic but then he said in a 100 years someone will raise up with the same thing and you will not be able to destroy him and 100 years later Jo um um Martin Luther raised up with the Joshua lived by faith he was a Catholic priest he didn't want to leave the Catholic church he wanted to fix the church but the church didn't want to change so they had to leave then John Wesley with the Anglican Church the same thing he didn't want to leave the Anglican Church he wanted to fix it amen but he had to leave the Pentecostal is the same way brother Braham had to leave the Baptist Church he didn't want to leave the Baptist Church but he had to because he didn't agree on their Doctrine and he tried to show them in the scriptures not right to have woman preachers but they didn't agree they wouldn't want to change so he had to leave amen because there's that religious systems rigid it it's it's this is how it is and this is how it is but God is always revealing himself more and more amen amen so it's always the it's always you know it's like John hus if the Catholic I mean um uh Martin Luther if the Catholic church had their way they would have burned him as well amen so it's always it's always that same thing the the false wants to destroy the true but the you know but the true doesn't want us you know they just want to fix what they're in then so now um yeah and and and then it says now so so it says so he said Babylon is Fallen ever is the habitation of of devils and the hold of every foul spirit so all the evil spirit you can say that's its habitation now I'm going to I'm going to quickly get through this because I don't want to be too long for all nations have drunk the Wrath the wine of the wrath of a fornication so the whole world has become drunk and the whole world is drunk why because the whole world has become pleasure mad you know all they want to have is a good time they don't just want to live everyday life that's true although you know even at school people just wanted to look forward to the weekend we're just in seventh form but people just go and then Monday what are we doing next weekend and the whole world is like what are we going to do when we get off work you know people don't just want to sit back and just look at life they want to be entertained you know and the world is people have become drunk with the pleasures of this world now and people have become very rich and then now let's go down let's go down to verse 9 I sorry verse eight therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judges her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing AAR off for the fear of her torment saying alas l the great City Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come then brother Bram says they're going to drop an atomic bomb on the Vatican that's why it's the burning and the torment and one hour is just going to be wiped off the face of the Earth cuz the Russians are going to drop a bomb on it that's exactly what's going to happen so so one Babylon here is destroyed by burning okay and then if we read and then let's just continue reading and the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buth their merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and Scarlet and all thine wood and all manner of vessels of iy and all manner of vessels of precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and oders and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and Beast and sheep and slaves I mean and horses and chariots and slaves and Souls of men so it's not just what what trades in Souls religion trades and souls yeah so but all these other things are economic things trade but then it's and The Souls of men so Rome doesn't just trade in wealth it trades in Souls of men yeah and the fruit of thy Soul sorry verse verse 14 and the fruits of thy Soul luses after that had departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more the merchants of these things which were made Rich by her shall stand AAR off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas L that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and Scarlet and Deck with gold and precious stones and jewels for in one hour so great riches has come to nor and every ship master and all the company of ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood a far off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like under this city it's called The Eternal City amen and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great City when were made Rich all that had ships in the sea by rant by reason of a coastlines from one hour is she made desolate now that's the first Babylon and then the second one Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets for God has Avenged you on her and a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great Millstone and cast it into the sea saying th with violence shall thou great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all all now we're going to read another description and it's different to the first one okay so we read about all the merchandise that was traded and everything that was in the first one and The Souls of men but now this next one is not burnt it's thrown like a stone Millstone into the sea yeah and then it says and the voice of Harpers and musicians and of Pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no Craftsman and whatsoever craft he be shall be found anymore in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more in thee and the light of a candle shall be shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the Bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy Merchants were the Great Men of the earth and for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and all that was slain upon the Earth so here's a different kind of Babylon and it says now for by the sorceries for by the sorceries of this place was all the men deceived now I'll just I'll just bring it on home this second Babylon the reason California or Los Angeles is going in is because Hollywood's there yeah and and brother Braham said once upon a time they'd go to Paris France to get all the filth of the world and Paris would export it to the world but then now Hollywood exports it to the world it does and this whole world your thinking I'll say your thinking has been changed because of what has come out of Hollywood whether you like it or not some things the way you think about certain things has been altered by Hollywood this whole society that we live in has been changed by Hollywood amen you might as well say Amen because it's true you take you take for example the you know you know you know Obama stood up the president stood up and he said all the schools now you have to have transgender friendly bathrooms it's not male and female anymore you have unisex bathrooms one of the states I might be wrong Georgia or one of the states actually said no we're not going to do this and then what happens is Hollywood stands up up and says unless you change to match this law we are not going to film any more movies or do anything in your state and you're going to lose a lot of money and income and then that state bows to what Hollywood says that's right yeah so there's an agenda that has come out am and it's actually who's driving it it's Hollywood is driving that agenda you have tock change even bathrooms now you say well that's not too significant it is if you look at the principle now is that a bunch of filmmakers are dictating this is how life should be once upon a time there was the king and there was the jester you you've seen the jester with the funny hat and he used to entertain everyone in the castle now the Jester's on the throne amen and everyone listens to the jester right how's that so an actor gets up says this and this and we should do this everyone takes everyone listens to what they say what's happening the gesture is now on the throne amen that's right and the whole world changes to what the gers say it used to be once a time you know it used to be once upon a time you're just a Jester I don't take you all too seriously now the whole world listens to what the gers have to say the entertainment the whole world whether you like it or not that's just how it is amen so so the devil has set up Hollywood in such a way that it's actually changed the face of the whole society has been changed because of what has come out of that place and not far from you know La there's there's Silicon Valley where there's Google and you know all the all the great technical companies of the world they're all just right there and Facebook and Twitter and Instagram all those things they're they're right there and someone can put a message Mage on on Instagram or Facebook someone who's a celebrity and it'll reach the whole world yeah some some celebrities they try and put photos on you know photos on the internet because they try and want to break the internet cuz they just want to get their picture out there they want to get their they want to project themselves over the world that's what they do and the whole world listens to the gers yeah you're not immune to it because it influences people around you it even influences your way you I was listening to you know you brother Bram the reason brother Bram didn't like I Love Lucy or everyone loves Lucy whatever it was is it wasn't just because it kept people out away from prayer meetings but it's because it was actually Lucy's husband was the dummy and she was the smart one yeah and so what what was it portraying now that men are dumb and the woman's actually the one in control so it actually was re-engineering Society yeah and you come down to Bob the Builder who saves the day most of the time is it Bob it's Wendy Wendy's the one who actually saves a day most of the time and she she's the helper yeah now girls can do everything but there's some things that girls shouldn't really do do you want a girl to be like in the Army yeah would you want to be you know or or be in the police force and see graphic terrible things that's not really A Woman's Place yeah they can do it but you see the whole thing about Bob the Builder now it's actually betraying boys are dumb the girls are the Smart Ones and girls are smart trust me I got three of them they're smart and it's good girls are smart but you see what it's done it's actually it's actually gone too far one way you say oh that's just being sexist no it's not because what is me what is what a what are men now what is a stereotypical man is he in is he remember someone who's in charge is not domineering you know who who lays down the law and that's not being in charge that's actually using fear to be in charge that's not actually being a real man it used to be that way sure but now a stereotypical man is just a guy who just floats along only cares about what sport stars are doing you know all they all they care about is that or finding some girl or finding a drink that's all they care about that's true that's what that's what man instead of actually having a one taking responsibility for what he's doing to actually taking control in a in the right way actually being the leadership showing Godly leadership they've actually just watered man has been watered down in such a way that he just floats along oh the stupid man yeah hey some are stupid sure but you know what I mean you understand the whole the whole of society has been re-engineered am and now where did that come from came from Hollywood yeah and so you know just go look at the world oh The Bachelor hey it's on we can't you go on to in you know like New Zealand Herald it's on the web page you just see the headlines you know but what is that betraying a man as he's not actually looking for a wife he's just looking for a good time you know he's not actually that's not that's not actually a real man I'm you think you're going on at a tangent no I'm not society's been re-engineered you know and all and all that guy is betraying is hey I'm just looking for Miss next one instead of the right one yeah and what is it it's actually just just just changing how how Society is oh there's nothing wrong with that yeah it is that's not a real man a real man Waits upon the Lord and then when when and then when the Lord shows him now this is the right one then he goes after that one and then he stays with that one and loves that one and gives himself in order to gives his whole life that his family and his wife especially you know he's not selfish real man's not selfish what is man these days what can I get and it's dog eat dog that's not a real man amen you understand no no but the honestly the whole world has been re-engineered the things the things that we see and even you know on the street whatever more it never used to be that way then what happened Hollywood came along you know movies movies have you know sometimes you just watch it and there's all the entertainment all these nice things but there's but there's a message being put across yeah even even even in there's a new movie I'm not recommending movies but there's you know Finding Nemo now there's Finding Dory and in the trailer there's these there's these two women one looks more like a man than a woman and they've got a baby in a in a in a uh buggy and some people saying well now this is the first transgender couple in a kid's movie what's it doing it's making it acceptable you say it's harmless it's trying to make it acceptable that's right and who's pushing it the same people that said to that state you better reverse that law otherwise we're not making films in your state what if they got to do with the laws of the land it's control right it's an agenda we're going to change society and they've done it yeah and that's why we look like the weirdos that's right amen We Are The Crazy Ones and they are the normal ones now but who says it's normal that's why there's a call in this day come out of her my people and it's not just out of churches now it's out of you could say mainstream culture yeah because that's all it's it's all encompassed now that's right amen people can be people can be in a church and be lost or they can just be in the world and be lost yeah and that's why there's the call come out of her my people and that's why we have a great responsibility because we have the thing that opens the door that lets the people out whether you realize it or not I'm just going to maybe just just put this burden on you a little bit you have the key you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen and so we have we have the key now I'm just going to close with this we have the key that can set people free so whenever you see anyone like that don't say you terrible person no we were blind remember doesn't matter if you're raised in church you were blind once upon a time and you would have ended if God didn't come across your path you would be there that's right it's not it's not your ability that you're free it's what he has done for you he wanted to set you free he wanted to change you that you can look at the world so don't you know if God can save you he can save them amen amen if he can open your eyes he can sure do it for them and so that's why don't ever look down on people but just say Lord if only they could I want them to have the same love and peace that I have for you I want them to have the same thing amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer gracious father Lord we've just had a read through your scriptures and
