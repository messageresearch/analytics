[8:41] praise the Lord God bless you all um
[8:42] this
[8:43] morning how you doing
[8:46] good wide awake ready to praise the
[8:49] Lord amen it's always nice the first
[8:52] service after Camp because um there's a
[8:56] bit of a heightened sort of spiritual
[8:58] climate
[9:01] it's it's a bit of a human thing you
[9:03] know when our mind gets on other things
[9:05] then we on on more natural things then
[9:07] we kind of slip into that mode but when
[9:09] our mind's been on spiritual things our
[9:11] spiritual temperature is a bit higher
[9:14] but let's keep what we
[9:17] gained you know we we we don't want Camp
[9:21] experiences just to be a bit of
[9:24] a it's always a refreshing but just a
[9:27] bit of a high and then we just sort of
[9:28] slip back down we want to keep keep what
[9:30] we gained you know we want to we want to
[9:31] keep make an effort to keep in in a good
[9:34] atmosphere all the time around
[9:36] us and um I believe that's the the
[9:41] um place that we're coming into is we we
[9:44] are we're going to keep ground that we
[9:46] gain you know and speaking of that we
[9:48] have some testimony we have a testimony
[9:50] time too if you'd like to share anything
[9:51] um any testimonies from the camp it's
[9:53] always nice to hear different ones
[9:55] experiences that they went through it
[9:57] Camp what what the Lord did you know we
[9:59] sometimes just get caught up in our
[10:00] little thing that we did there and we're
[10:01] unaware of other things that happen so
[10:03] it's always enjoyable for me to hear
[10:05] them as well so let's um let's stand
[10:06] this morning and we just open up in
[10:08] prayer and ask the Lord to be with us
[10:11] Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord

[10:58] everything out of the service that you
[10:59] would have for us may we not look at it
[11:02] carnally Lord and just think we're just

[23:38] amen amen praise the Lord you can take
[23:40] your seats this morning we have the
[23:42] first uh item and testimony from Sister
[23:56] ping
[24:10] Shalom
[24:11] s i I just have a ever
[24:16] testimony um the thur day uh before the
[24:20] the camp um we were in low heart
[24:25] normally Amma has got some keyboard
[24:27] lesson
[24:28] um in low heart Thursdays we were
[24:31] driving towards that and at the same
[24:35] time we also needed to go to Queens gate
[24:38] uh to get some few things um and
[24:44] um on our way there uh I think we had
[24:48] just turned on the roundabout in hot
[24:53] Road and there was a black car driving
[24:55] in front of me it was just a moment of
[24:59] looking at arm and before I know it
[25:02] there is this car in front of me that
[25:04] has stopped I trust I tried the best
[25:08] possible way um to stop the car and
[25:12] there was just no way out turning I was
[25:15] still going to hit him either side and
[25:17] the only thing that was left was to hit
[25:21] him the funny thing for me was that I
[25:25] think I was I wasn't doing anything
[25:28] about 50 km per hour but
[25:31] somehow the airbags were popped um the
[25:37] car is not that badly damaged I think
[25:40] the only thing that was affected was the
[25:43] radiator even the leak what was just
[25:46] like a drop
[25:49] um so the person that I hit
[25:54] um left the scene so I really don't know
[25:58] what happened and I would like to
[26:00] believe that he didn't just stop for the
[26:02] sake of stopping clearly there must have
[26:04] been something that he saw or that made
[26:07] him to stop but anyway it happened and I
[26:11] was taken um called some people and the
[26:15] support was enormous there were other
[26:17] three brothers on the road who helped me
[26:19] out but I just want to thank the Lord
[26:23] because it could have been worse Amma
[26:27] God
[26:28] head I think her wrist was affected um
[26:31] and I think the impact as well of the
[26:33] airbag on her chest but we can only
[26:37] thank the Lord so um if the devil had
[26:42] his way we wouldn't have made it to to
[26:44] the
[26:45] camp I called brother kuben it wasn't
[26:48] planned and he's like you are coming to
[26:49] the camp I've got a small car to borrow
[26:52] to you so I am just so grateful that we
[26:57] we made it to to the camp because it was
[27:00] such a
[27:02] blessing and um today again it's our one
[27:06] year anniversary here in New
[27:09] Zealand and um we have just seen so much
[27:13] love um from each and every one of
[27:17] you um I have never felt alone my kids
[27:22] have never felt alone because we have
[27:24] you here and I just wanted to to thank
[27:28] the Lord for each and every one of you I
[27:30] know I don't say it often to each and
[27:33] one of you to say thank you but I just
[27:36] pray that God will bless you and give
[27:40] you all your heart's desires that is
[27:43] just my testimony and the camp it was
[27:45] our first as well um it was lit uh it
[27:49] was a
[27:50] blessing one thing that I know is that
[27:55] we can never lose it doesn't matter what
[27:59] happens we cannot just lose and just
[28:03] thinking of that makes me realize how
[28:06] small we are and how great God is
[28:10] because we make all these mistakes
[28:13] because I blamed myself somehow for the
[28:15] incident but at the same time I'm like
[28:18] but I can't take any fault all the
[28:21] faults all the mistakes everything that
[28:23] we do we just cannot take accountability
[28:26] of it and that's just the nice thing
[28:29] that God has done for us he's just
[28:31] taking the blame for everything that we
[28:35] are doing and hence I'm saying we can
[28:38] never lose in any way so I've got a song
[28:41] that I'm going to sing um in English it
[28:44] says in the hollow of his hands but
[28:48] please bear with me I am going to do it

[32:50] us God bless you
[32:53] Saints hello oh um um man it was a
[32:58] marvelous Camp thank you so much
[33:02] everyone knows who did did all the
[33:04] laboring behind the scenes and in front
[33:07] of the scenes the Lord knows and
[33:11] it's blew me away actually and Naomi and
[33:16] I were flying around her house
[33:19] spiritually for a quite a while after
[33:22] and I know some other people in in uh
[33:24] talaki are also do still up around the
[33:28] ceiling somewhere so praise the Lord
[33:31] thank you so much um just a tiny
[33:34] testimony something at camp that was
[33:36] very special and really helped me a lot
[33:39] I'm not um particularly good at getting
[33:41] up
[33:43] early and um but at Camp I seem to be
[33:47] able to I think it's just the amazing
[33:49] anointing that's there or something and
[33:52] anyway um so I was able to get up early
[33:56] the the morning mornings I was there
[33:59] and after getting ready I wanted to go
[34:01] and have a cup of tea
[34:05] and um but you know I think as we go on
[34:09] further with the Lord we're always
[34:10] trying to find his will and what we do
[34:12] and even the little things and I can
[34:16] understand why brother brandom got very
[34:17] nervous because it might actually
[34:19] sometimes it affects me and I get a bit
[34:21] nervous I'm doing the right thing is
[34:23] this where the Lord wants me to go is
[34:25] this who the Lord wants me to talk to
[34:26] and all that kind of thing and we can
[34:29] get overly concerned and we can get too
[34:31] tense about it instead of relaxing a bit
[34:33] I'm speaking for myself so after um I
[34:38] was heading from where we were sleeping
[34:40] towards the dining hall and you know
[34:44] there's that ramp from outside that goes
[34:47] up and I was walking along thinking is
[34:49] this what you want me to do Lord and
[34:51] then a brother a few quite a few years
[34:54] back had written a song that goes
[34:57] why don't you walk a while with me I
[35:01] don't know if any of you know that song
[35:03] it was brother Bob M and um there was I
[35:09] just that the words of that song just
[35:11] came to me like that and I had this
[35:14] Choice cup of
[35:16] tea
[35:17] or um walk down and across the bridge
[35:23] and it was a bit of a battle because I'm
[35:26] a social person and I like to talk to
[35:29] people and that it wasn't just the cup
[35:31] of tea it was the attraction of
[35:33] fellowshipping and that but I thought
[35:36] okay just made the right decision so I
[35:40] thought put the Lord first so as I
[35:44] didn't go up that ramp but you know the
[35:46] the pool is there and then you walk down
[35:48] towards the toilets and then it like
[35:51] that well there was two welcome swallows
[35:55] up on the little wire thing thing and
[35:57] they both just as I walk started to walk
[35:59] down there swept down and went by me now
[36:03] I don't know whether they do that to
[36:05] other people or normally but for me
[36:07] personally that was like the Lord saying
[36:10] welcome it was just to me it was like oh
[36:15] I'm in the Lord's will I'm doing the
[36:16] right thing and then to walk down and I
[36:19] don't think I've done it before now I
[36:21] haven't at Camp haven't taken the time
[36:23] to walk down there with that um that
[36:26] Bridges and the jetty that the children
[36:29] fish off before that bridge there was no
[36:33] one else there and the lake was just so
[36:38] calm and peaceful and
[36:40] beautiful and I thought man I nearly
[36:43] missed all this you know and the
[36:45] busyness of Camp not that I'm to much
[36:49] but um you know you can get caught up in
[36:53] the social side of things I can't um to
[36:57] walk a while with the Lord and it was
[37:00] just so peaceful and I just was able to
[37:02] spend a bit of time with him down there
[37:05] I just thank the Lord for those those
[37:07] little times he gives us when we listen
[37:09] to his voice you know praise the
[37:15] Lord
[37:25] amen
[37:28] oh can be next God bless you everybody
[37:32] uh just a quick testimony so the few
[37:35] weeks before Camp I'm sure we all love
[37:37] it battle's very intense I mean I don't
[37:40] know about you but I love getting
[37:42] chisled by God it's very fun um and I
[37:47] was in the ring with Satan as we all are
[37:50] and I'm always a winner even if I'm not
[37:52] winning in my circumstances I still know
[37:55] I am a winner so so I was in The Ring Of
[37:57] Satan and then I sat down in the corner
[37:59] for a drink of water I was just like
[38:02] getting a little bit
[38:03] tired all right let's uh watch a sermon
[38:06] and Andy had preached a sermon here I
[38:09] don't know might have been a week or two
[38:11] or three before Camp I can't remember
[38:13] when and he just said don't wait till
[38:17] Camp till you to get to a 10 already be
[38:19] at a 10 and then and then go to Camp I
[38:23] was like Ah that's pretty good he was
[38:25] like don't don't be at mine five and and
[38:27] get to camp and get to zero something
[38:30] like that I was like oh yeah that's good
[38:32] so that just just Greatful to the Lord
[38:35] for letting Andy say that to give me the
[38:38] strength for another few days I didn't
[38:40] get up to 10 but I got above minus five
[38:42] so that was
[38:44] good
[38:47] [Applause]
[38:55] yeah Oh
[39:01] short thanks um I know I'm really new
[39:04] here Collins my name and uh so there's
[39:08] only the second service but I got to go
[39:10] to Camp which was really marvelous um
[39:14] and uh I've been quite um hungry for
[39:18] what God's got more of and uh just at
[39:22] the beginning of the year um I met a guy
[39:25] his name's Tim Spurgeon I met him up in
[39:28] tang and uh I'd only met him twice and
[39:32] then had no more to do with him and all
[39:35] of a sudden comes a text from him um and
[39:41] uh it's um just gone um where's it gone
[39:48] anyway it's the text
[39:51] that has a scripture in it and he just
[39:54] felt that it was for me
[39:57] and uh out of the blue and it's behold
[39:59] I'll do a new thing and I'll make roads
[40:01] in the desert and all that one and uh I
[40:04] look he it's just disappeared off here
[40:07] but um yeah so this is the new road and
[40:11] uh and uh I'm I'm really excited yeah so
[40:16] um the previous church I've been at um
[40:20] I've been there 15 years so so it's a
[40:23] definitely a new
[40:24] road yeah and so I'm looking forward for
[40:27] everything God's got for
[40:30] [Applause]
[40:42] me Isaiah 43: 19 behold I will do a new
[40:47] thing now it shall spring forth shall ye
[40:50] not know it I will even make a way in
[40:53] the wilderness and rivers in the desert
[40:55] amen praise the
[41:03] Lord anyone
[41:13] else supposed to say something but that
[41:16] scripture just inspired something out to
[41:18] me because I remember when I arrived at
[41:20] Camp I think was among the last people
[41:22] to come to camp but when I arrived to
[41:24] Camp I arrived around
[41:27] 11
[41:28] 12 Monday morning
[41:33] and I battle with the idea of coming to
[41:36] Camp not because I don't want to come
[41:38] but because work issues a story one
[41:42] other day but I've learned to get to a
[41:44] point where I tell God like I I just
[41:47] thank God for the because there some
[41:50] ones were so for me and they were like
[41:54] um it doesn't doesn't matter what the
[41:58] devil
[41:59] brings I get to a point where I tell God
[42:02] what do you have me to do because at
[42:05] this point I cannot control anything
[42:07] anymore so just have your way whatever
[42:11] you just just just put in me the will to
[42:14] just keep walking and no matter how hard
[42:18] it gets just let me keep as long as
[42:21] you're with me that's all that matters
[42:23] so I did not show up at Camp of course
[42:26] all those days but I streamed all of
[42:29] them as loud as possible at work I
[42:33] didn't care how many guests are coming
[42:35] in I'm at the reception like this and
[42:37] I'm just putting my phone there loud and
[42:39] and guests are just walking by and
[42:41] they're just like moving and I think
[42:42] they're just thinking this girl is nuts
[42:45] but yeah I'm not for the Lord I really
[42:48] did not care I was just listening they
[42:50] were so good I was just like Hallelujah
[42:53] this is so
[42:54] sweet and then on Sunday
[42:57] night I I came from home going to my for
[43:01] my shifts feeling quite unwell but I did
[43:03] not know what God was planning because
[43:06] already I've just told him you know just
[43:08] have your way and I really got sick and
[43:10] then I get I had a one guest who was
[43:12] remaining cuz I knew I was coming to
[43:14] come but I was like I wish I can get
[43:17] there
[43:20] earlier God has his own way he works in
[43:22] mysterious ways want us perform but I I
[43:25] normally my shift ends at 11 I left work
[43:28] at 10: because I was literally sick I
[43:32] was a bit Lego I don't know if anyone
[43:34] knows with Lego and I did not know it
[43:37] was attacking me at that time but I was
[43:39] feeling really nauseated I'm not the
[43:40] type to vomit so you just feel vomit
[43:43] coming up and it's not coming out and it
[43:45] just feel really hot and nauseous and
[43:47] all those kind of very bad stuff I went
[43:50] out get some fresh and it was just
[43:52] really
[43:53] bad but at 10 Shar I I had finished
[43:56] everything locked up and I mean in my
[43:59] head I'm like I need to go home but I'm
[44:01] like I'm going to come and I went and I
[44:04] reached
[44:05] C it's it's just interesting how God
[44:08] made me sick to leave work
[44:11] early to get to
[44:13] C so for me that's that was God's work
[44:16] so when I get sick as long as he's with
[44:20] me that's okay if I'm fine as long as
[44:23] he's with me so at the end of the day I
[44:25] just God that he works in mysterious
[44:28] ways it doesn't matter whether we're in
[44:29] a dark very darkest Hall we're still
[44:32] there with him and I like the song
[44:34] because I'm still it in the hollow of
[44:39] his hands so it does not matter where it
[44:42] is in our eyes it's it seems really
[44:46] rugged and bad and everything but we are
[44:49] still in the H of his hands yeah so
[44:54] yeah
[45:21] amen praise the Lord
[45:24] amen uh so from a sound perspective just
[45:27] to give you a bit of
[45:29] background that Hall is
[45:32] atrocious you know if it if you ever had
[45:34] a challenge on trying to get a sound
[45:37] come out of a speaker not bounce Against
[45:39] the Wall come back at people and and
[45:41] hurting their ears that's the hall you
[45:42] don't want to be in but we we've got
[45:45] this Hall and the Lord has said this is
[45:47] where you'll have your camps and we go
[45:49] we we need to deal with
[45:51] it testimony and glory to God is pride
[45:54] is a a very awful thing and it gets you
[45:58] into a place where you count on your own
[46:00] ability and if anybody comes and say hey
[46:03] I would like to to give you a hand you
[46:06] get full of Pride and and you just push
[46:08] them away no matter how big the
[46:09] situation no no how matter how little
[46:12] the task somebody says I want to come
[46:14] and help you say
[46:16] yes say yes pride is even in if infancy
[46:21] you say um and there's a couple of
[46:23] examples in the camp but I won't I may
[46:25] be use it in a sermon one day but where
[46:27] people will come and say can I give you
[46:29] a
[46:30] hand and you go n now I'm fine that's
[46:32] Pride address it right there because
[46:35] even if you're fine people come and help
[46:38] cuz God send them to come and help and
[46:39] you're just too busy to listen to God so
[46:42] what's the same with me and um everybody
[46:44] and Brother Joseph if you're looking
[46:46] this is all for you and me I I want a
[46:49] brother to Christ because now we get
[46:51] Teran Church to come and help and which
[46:52] is pretty much they are
[46:54] family and and um Joseph says can I can
[46:57] I help with a camp and I go talk to
[47:00] Ed I did because we we we work with a
[47:04] system we fight with a system we we
[47:06] already have all those challenges to
[47:08] have another wheel on the wagon goes oh
[47:11] yeah I don't need that but wait I needed
[47:13] it I didn't know so we get to camp and
[47:16] poor Ed he has to babysit me and and
[47:18] Joseph on the Thursday we just at it you
[47:21] know the whole Thursday we're just
[47:22] fighting cuz we want the sound to work
[47:24] but Joseph has a gift that the Lord has
[47:26] placed with him and it is come to eqs
[47:29] and how to to do all the speakers and
[47:31] the right setting so that the sound will
[47:33] come out clearer CU we don't want that
[47:36] Distortion and I know how to pull a
[47:38] cable and plug it into the thing and
[47:39] that's pretty much where it end so I
[47:41] needed him but because pride is there it
[47:44] was always that push because every time
[47:46] he'll come with a suggestion I'll kick
[47:47] back you're like you know why you
[47:49] changing this and you need to give me
[47:50] the that and and halfway through the
[47:53] Thursday I kind of realized I I can't do
[47:55] it
[47:56] this is actually bigger than me because
[47:58] the whole point of Camp is let God be
[48:00] glorified not man so so my motive there
[48:03] was wrong to begin with so I had to go
[48:06] and sit down at a stage and go Lord I'll
[48:09] just serve same same as what you said
[48:11] walking around to the river I'll just
[48:13] obey saying as sister ping you know I'll
[48:15] just go I'll just go wherever Lord just
[48:17] send me I just want to be in your in
[48:19] your will so so whatever is going to
[48:21] happen now next I need to surrender to
[48:23] my pride little thing but massive so I
[48:27] said okay Joseph this is a deal if you
[48:29] change something just tell me what you
[48:31] changed and tell me the why so I can
[48:33] kind understand why we doing it cuz
[48:35] there's no point changing it and I can't
[48:37] fix it afterwards but it's not fixing it
[48:39] he fixed it but then he started showing
[48:42] me how it works and I started going to
[48:45] it and said okay bro well then if you
[48:47] know all these these technical things
[48:49] why don't you do that side of it and
[48:51] I'll just be volume control and damage
[48:53] control cuz when anything goes down I'll
[48:55] just make that happen he goes sweet and
[48:57] we made a good deal and we said okay
[48:58] this is how we're going to do this camp
[49:00] and the sound of Camp was
[49:02] awesome and it was a challenge because
[49:05] when brother Bley was losing his voice
[49:07] that's the hardest time where you have
[49:09] no voice in the microphone to try and
[49:11] put it through a speaker it's very hard
[49:13] but we got through it and we still had
[49:15] camp and afterwards I said to to Brother
[49:18] Joseph it was the most interesting Camp
[49:20] because all along I thought I was right
[49:22] but all along I was wrong I said because
[49:25] my motive was wrong though we all
[49:27] serving God you want to serve him out of
[49:29] your ability and that's not what God
[49:31] wants so my testimony brother Isaac is
[49:35] sometimes most of the time to be less is
[49:38] to be more in the kingdom of God Amen so
[49:41] all glory to God for humbling
[49:45] me and thank you brother
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:54] Joseph
[49:58] God bless you Saints I just thought
[50:00] something quick to share um we were at
[50:03] camp and there was a there was anointed
[50:05] word or inspired word to me that just
[50:07] hit hit somewhere so deep in my soul and
[50:10] heart that I went and shook the um
[50:12] preacher's hand the young lad I
[50:13] forgotten his name um and he was saying
[50:16] how we'll fight for certain things and
[50:17] he said we'll fight for our young Youth
[50:19] and previously I had been um I don't
[50:22] know if it was it was something I
[50:24] listened to and it was saying how we're
[50:25] not going to give the devil our increase
[50:27] and we're not going to give the devil
[50:28] our joy or anything and they say we're
[50:30] not going to give the devil our youth or
[50:31] our younger generation and it just hit
[50:33] so deep and he like yes we are going to
[50:35] fight for our younger generation in our
[50:37] church and I just wanted to tell you
[50:46] that
[50:54] amen
[50:56] God bless you all I really didn't want
[50:58] to come up because I don't really know
[50:59] what to say but I had to so um I've just
[51:04] I was delivered from something a while
[51:05] ago but the devil didn't let me accept
[51:08] that and I just the whole Camp was a
[51:10] mind battle and a lot of guilt and it
[51:14] was just the actual confidence and the
[51:16] sermons were such a blessing but just
[51:18] told me no it's done and it was actually
[51:20] just the accepting of that which was so
[51:22] hard like that was the biggest thing but
[51:24] it was just done you know and I just
[51:27] thank the Lord for that because it's
[51:29] just changed a lot for me so thank you
[51:33] [Applause]
[51:46] Lord God bless
[51:50] you the devil is a
[51:54] loser and I'm the winner and you are the
[51:57] winner my one is there's a scripture in
[52:00] the Bible that says resist the devil and
[52:05] he shall flee and full stop doesn't go
[52:09] further than that resist the devil and
[52:12] he shall flee I always said to myself
[52:15] the opposite is also true if you don't
[52:18] resist it resist him he will
[52:22] accumulate what came out strongly for me
[52:24] at the camp
[52:25] was when brother biley spoke about
[52:28] maturity and
[52:30] growth and I realized that uh there was
[52:35] a professor who said an old Professor
[52:39] who who was way long in the field of
[52:43] academic and research and he wrote in a
[52:46] book and he said after 40 years of being
[52:48] a
[52:50] professor and uh thinking that i' I Know
[52:53] It All I've now come to realize that up
[52:56] to today I'm still
[52:58] learning so brothers and sisters until
[53:01] we go home we none of us will ever get
[53:04] enough of God so I thank the Lord that
[53:07] he has brought the issue uh the aspect
[53:09] of growing and
[53:11] maturity uh you know through the sermons
[53:14] and I really appreciate those brothers
[53:15] who came to preach for us God bless
[53:24] you
[53:30] God bless you everyone um just a quick
[53:32] one I'm just really grateful that I was
[53:34] able to come to Camp um and grateful for
[53:38] everyone's prayers everywhere I went um
[53:41] on the first few days people that I met
[53:44] were saying that they were praying for
[53:45] me so I'm just so grateful to the family
[53:47] of God for that um and that I could be
[53:54] there
[54:13] no hello everyone I just want to say I'm
[54:16] so glad to be home I'm very I'm very
[54:19] unhappy I missed camp but I um I just
[54:22] want to thank the Lord for all we had 14
[54:26] flights and I'm not really that happy
[54:27] about flying and I just feel like in six
[54:31] weeks God really looked after me and
[54:34] brought me home safely
[54:36] and I missed you all so God bless
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:54] you God bless you all um just wanted to
[54:59] uh kind of like overview about six
[55:01] testimonies because we were so
[55:03] privileged and blessed to have the youth
[55:05] all youth got in contact wanted to come
[55:07] up on Friday night and just spend time
[55:09] together and share testimonies and um
[55:11] Andy and I were blessed enough to be
[55:13] there and just hear the heart of our
[55:16] youth and I'm really really thankful to
[55:18] each and every one of you um we know
[55:20] like in our whole Fellowship but also
[55:22] just to see the youth how they've had a
[55:23] real touch from the Lord and each one
[55:25] sharing from their heart just so humble
[55:28] and thankful for what the Lord's doing
[55:29] and sharing about the fire that's been
[55:32] rekindled or lit and um just seeing no
[55:35] glory go to the devil whatsoever and
[55:38] just seeing all glory go to God and how
[55:40] they're just humble and thankful and
[55:42] just excited to see what's going to
[55:43] happen from here on and one testimony
[55:47] someone shared with me that always stuck
[55:49] with me and when I kept hearing all the
[55:50] youth testimony one thing that um just
[55:53] stayed there and kept coming back to my
[55:55] mind it is more Supernatural than it
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:21] appears someone's thinking should I go
[56:24] up shall I not I go up shall I
[56:42] not praise the Lord it was a um it was a
[56:46] very Supernatural camp for me um the way
[56:50] that I would describe it is
[56:53] um
[56:56] they I always wanted the first song to
[56:58] be one of them it was just I don't know
[57:00] why I couldn't get away from that song
[57:01] it's it's not it's just quite a normal
[57:04] song and
[57:07] nothing it's a nice song but it's just a
[57:09] song but I just felt that's going to be
[57:12] the opening song of the camp I had all
[57:13] the other songs moved around moved
[57:15] around but that one just stayed there
[57:16] and then when it was the ending song at
[57:19] the camp the the brother I think it was
[57:20] brother Isaac he said oh let's sing one
[57:22] of them at the end to me that kind of
[57:25] encapsulated what the camp was like it
[57:27] was just a
[57:28] supernatural experience that that God
[57:30] was just in control from the the
[57:31] beginning to the end and and so that
[57:34] that was yeah it was an outstanding time
[57:37] for me let's um stand this morning we'll
[57:38] just sing one song as brother Ben comes

[1:02:00] by the mouth of All His prophets that
[1:02:02] Christ should suffer he hath so
[1:02:04] fulfilled repent ye therefore and be
[1:02:06] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:02:09] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:02:11] come from the presence of the Lord and
[1:02:12] He Shall send Jesus Christ which before
[1:02:14] was preached unto you whom the Heaven
[1:02:17] Must receive until the times of
[1:02:18] restitution of all things which God hath
[1:02:21] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[1:02:23] prophets since the world

[1:02:41] exalted to the right hand of pharaoh uh
[1:02:44] here in Egypt it says and Pharaoh said

[1:02:56] according unto Thy word shall all my
[1:02:58] people be ruled only in the throne will
[1:03:00] I be greater than thou and pharoh said
[1:03:02] unto Joseph see I have set thee over all
[1:03:04] the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off
[1:03:07] his ring from his hand and put it upon
[1:03:08] Joseph's hand and he raid him in
[1:03:10] vestures of fine linen and put a gold
[1:03:13] chain about his neck and he made him to
[1:03:15] ride in the second Chariot which he had
[1:03:18] and they cried before him bow the knee
[1:03:19] and he made him ruler over all the land
[1:03:21] of Egypt and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I
[1:03:23] am pharaoh
[1:03:24] and without thee shall no man lift up
[1:03:26] his hand or foot in all the land of
[1:03:28] Egypt and Pharaoh's um called Joseph's

[1:03:59] service that you would take control Lord

[1:04:21] blood would cover us Lord and may you

[1:04:24] so much and thank you for all you did at
[1:04:26] Camp Lord we're so thankful you're not
[1:04:28] just at camp but you said you never
[1:04:29] leave us nor forsake us so may you
[1:04:31] continue to lead us on by Your Word in
[1:04:33] Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God
[1:04:36] bless you you may have your seats this
[1:04:37] morning so I want to take um I want to
[1:04:39] speak about uh Joseph's wife because
[1:04:44] we're living in this day and I'm
[1:04:45] probably going to jump around but sorry
[1:04:47] my throat hasn't recovered from all the
[1:04:50] praising and shouting and things you
[1:04:52] know you know but you know we live in a
[1:04:55] time of we live in the times of
[1:04:56] refreshing we live in a time when God is
[1:04:58] pouring out his Spirit more and more now
[1:05:01] all this I'm going to tell you is not
[1:05:02] you know nothing new but I just want to
[1:05:04] I want to just encourage you that you
[1:05:06] know your position that's right am mean
[1:05:08] if you know who you are the devil didn't
[1:05:10] put you there the devil can't take you
[1:05:11] out amen so if you just stand in your
[1:05:13] god-given position your god-given rights
[1:05:16] amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:18] remember the devil didn't put you there
[1:05:19] he can't take you out amen God called
[1:05:21] you and he placed you in a position and
[1:05:23] God wants you in that position and if
[1:05:25] God wants you as the bride of Christ
[1:05:27] you're going to be there amen amen
[1:05:28] you've got to but we have to surrender
[1:05:30] our Humanity to God's call I mean we've
[1:05:33] got to give our lives over that that
[1:05:35] that God's Vision becomes our vision and
[1:05:38] then it become manifested amen because
[1:05:40] there's so many voices in this world
[1:05:42] that try and give us a double mind I
[1:05:44] mean try and make us forget who we are
[1:05:46] and what God has already made us amen we
[1:05:48] got to realize that we are the bride of
[1:05:49] Christ am mean we are join ears with him
[1:05:52] amen We Are Made In His Image we're
[1:05:53] called by his name washed in his blood
[1:05:56] am mean that that that our identity
[1:05:57] should not be in our natural family
[1:06:00] right our our identity should be in
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ the word right that should
[1:06:05] be the defining piece of our identity
[1:06:08] sure we have our nationalities we have
[1:06:09] our you know we have our you know
[1:06:11] Humanity but that shouldn't Define us
[1:06:14] right because brother Braham came to a
[1:06:15] place in his life where he realized that
[1:06:17] he wasn't just the son and of Charles
[1:06:20] and Al Brandon but he was a Son of God
[1:06:23] and when he came to that that gave a
[1:06:24] stability in his life that he wasn't
[1:06:26] tossed to and fro by humanity and
[1:06:28] people's opinions and you know
[1:06:30] popularity trying to fit in all these
[1:06:32] things CU he realized that he was a Son
[1:06:34] of God and when he realized he was a Son
[1:06:36] of God it gave him a stability in his
[1:06:38] life no matter who was pulling pushing
[1:06:40] proding whatever he could stand there on
[1:06:43] God's word and realize I am a Son of God
[1:06:46] I mean I am not just a brandom amen I am
[1:06:49] a Son of God I'm called by his names
[1:06:52] this is where I'm trying to go along
[1:06:53] these lines right
[1:06:54] because we you know we live in a day
[1:06:56] where where where God we are living in
[1:06:58] this time of refreshing I mean you see
[1:07:00] when the rain comes Jew falls on the
[1:07:02] ground it's a refreshing for nature
[1:07:04] maybe it's been a dry summer or a dry
[1:07:06] day but when that rain comes in the
[1:07:08] evening I mean it refreshes the plants
[1:07:10] maybe the leaves begin to whip when the
[1:07:12] rain comes out it refreshes and they
[1:07:14] open back up again and you know they
[1:07:16] begin to grow and Bloom and you know
[1:07:18] we're living in that day I me we're not
[1:07:20] living in a dry day I me we're not
[1:07:21] living in a cold day we're not you even
[1:07:24] though the devil wants it to be dry he
[1:07:25] wants it to be cold he wants us to be
[1:07:27] indifferent but God wants us to be
[1:07:29] soaked amen he wants us to be saturated
[1:07:31] by his presence that's what God wants
[1:07:33] amen so if God wants it I say Amen Lord
[1:07:37] remember because he wants to he wants to
[1:07:39] reveal himself more than we want him to
[1:07:41] reveal himself to us right he wants to
[1:07:43] live in our lives more than we want him
[1:07:44] to live in our lives and I'm sure we can
[1:07:46] say we want him to live oh yes 24 hours
[1:07:49] a day 7even days a week when you're on
[1:07:51] holiday whenever on the job you want him
[1:07:53] to live amen School wherever you are you
[1:07:55] want him to live right so but he wants
[1:07:57] to live more than you want him to live
[1:07:58] amen so I'm so thankful God's that way
[1:08:01] but see see so we're living in this time
[1:08:03] of refreshing where you know that has
[1:08:05] come from the presence of the Lord amen
[1:08:07] this refreshing didn't come from a
[1:08:09] building amen hasn't come from a Bible
[1:08:11] School hasn't come from a church
[1:08:13] building hasn't come from a campground
[1:08:15] it's come from the presence of the Lord
[1:08:17] amen so God is pouring out his Spirit
[1:08:19] more and more because he's getting us
[1:08:21] ready amen he's preparing our Hearts
[1:08:24] he's changing our lives amen this is not
[1:08:26] human Reformation this is God's
[1:08:28] transforming power to align us with his
[1:08:31] word amen to change our thinking our
[1:08:33] moods everything we are to be balanced
[1:08:35] in the word of God Amen so so there is
[1:08:38] this time of refreshing now during this
[1:08:41] time of refreshing as it says here and
[1:08:43] he shall send Jesus Christ whom before
[1:08:45] was preached unto you whom the Heaven
[1:08:47] Must receive until the times of
[1:08:49] restitution of all things so so Jesus
[1:08:52] Will so we're physically going to meet
[1:08:53] him in the air amen that's what
[1:08:55] Believers believe amen the Rapture
[1:08:57] culminates with the believer's bodies
[1:08:59] change we our bodies have changed but
[1:09:01] we'll physically meet our Lord in the
[1:09:03] air we'll physically meet the one who
[1:09:05] hung on Calvary in the air we'll see him
[1:09:07] face to face there amen he's preparing
[1:09:10] us for that time amen and if God has
[1:09:12] called you by his word he's quickened
[1:09:14] his word to you you've received the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost you're in raptured condition amen
[1:09:19] already amen you're sure you'll have
[1:09:21] struggles you'll have the things
[1:09:22] overcome you'll have battles but you've
[1:09:24] got to real I can't remember who said it
[1:09:25] but we have the victory amen amen we're
[1:09:28] in the we're in the palm of his hands
[1:09:29] amen we are we are there safe and secure
[1:09:32] we have the victory because we have the
[1:09:34] Overcomer in Us by the baptism of the
[1:09:35] Holy Ghost right sure we have trouble
[1:09:38] but the Overcomer is greater than that
[1:09:39] trouble amen so so we are looking for
[1:09:43] the physical return of our Lord Jesus
[1:09:45] Christ we are looking for the physical
[1:09:47] resurrection of the Dead in Christ we're
[1:09:50] looking for the change of these bodies
[1:09:51] right this is what Believers believe
[1:09:53] amen so there has to he will stay there
[1:09:57] in heaven I put it that way until the
[1:09:59] times of restitution or restoration of
[1:10:01] all things now notice there's multiple
[1:10:05] times of restitution so there's a
[1:10:08] restoration of the Bride right the
[1:10:11] church started in the book of Acts amen
[1:10:13] God moved and Power dwelt in his church
[1:10:16] but that wasn't a harvest amen that that
[1:10:18] was going to be taken it was actually
[1:10:19] that happened that the church would
[1:10:21] eventually planted it would die but come
[1:10:23] forth in a Reformation amen through the
[1:10:25] church ages but now we've come to a time
[1:10:28] where the bride has been restored back
[1:10:30] to the book of Acts amen we there's a
[1:10:32] New Testament Church rising up amen and
[1:10:35] we've risen up amen you got to realize
[1:10:37] you've risen up amen if God has
[1:10:39] quickened you from death to life you've
[1:10:40] risen up but then now the rest of our
[1:10:42] Walkers God unveils who we are according
[1:10:45] to him amen that's the thing that
[1:10:47] matters it's not what the devil says you
[1:10:49] are or what you say you are it's what
[1:10:51] God says you are that's the thing that's
[1:10:53] stands amen that's the thing that
[1:10:55] matters it's not my opinion about me
[1:10:57] that matters my opinion
[1:10:58] changes and and sadly it's mainly
[1:11:01] negative about me right but you know but
[1:11:04] it's God's opinion you know when I begin
[1:11:06] to read Lord what do you say about me
[1:11:08] Lord hallelujah what do you say about me
[1:11:11] Lord you're worthy amen you're made in
[1:11:13] my image you're washed in my blood see
[1:11:16] the thing is the devil you know the
[1:11:17] devil's got this mind battle who said
[1:11:19] you have the right to claim God's given
[1:11:22] promises who said you have the right to
[1:11:24] say you're clean who says you have the
[1:11:26] right I mean to say you're washing the
[1:11:28] blood that you're an overcomer who said
[1:11:30] he says that because he's trying to push
[1:11:31] you back down under his control am me we
[1:11:33] can say Satan the Covenant I have with
[1:11:36] God you're not in the picture you're not
[1:11:38] in the picture you're just the accuser
[1:11:39] of the Brethren you do your job I'll do
[1:11:42] my job I'll stand on your head am mean
[1:11:44] I'll be victorious if I let God do his
[1:11:47] job in my
[1:11:48] life amen this is this is how we you
[1:11:51] know we need to look we honestly we need
[1:11:53] to feed on what God has told us about
[1:11:55] ourselves this is an age of identity
[1:11:58] crisis where people forget who they are
[1:12:00] this is why there's you know depression
[1:12:02] and you know suicide all these troubles
[1:12:04] come into the has come into the human
[1:12:06] race because people don't know who they
[1:12:07] are right and and that identity can move
[1:12:10] like the wind but if we realize that God
[1:12:12] has given us our true identity I mean
[1:12:15] this is why the message came to give us
[1:12:17] our true identity in Christ that we
[1:12:19] would realize that we are the children
[1:12:21] of the most high God am amen I'm just
[1:12:24] going to plug away amen I just pray that
[1:12:26] the devil would just be you know we're
[1:12:27] going to realize that sure the devil
[1:12:29] fights us but God is greater than the
[1:12:31] enemy he's greater than all our problems
[1:12:33] amen he's greater he is our Lord is the
[1:12:35] solution to every problem that we have
[1:12:37] amen and so during this time of
[1:12:40] refreshing there will be a restoration
[1:12:41] of all things so so people will go
[1:12:44] that's why brother ad when he preached
[1:12:45] the opening of the seals he says I no
[1:12:47] longer call you church but I call you
[1:12:49] bride that you'll understand amen that
[1:12:51] you will understand your position in the
[1:12:53] word amen that we are not just a church
[1:12:55] amen but we are the bride of Christ now
[1:12:57] a church is like a bunch of servants
[1:12:59] like we heard over the weekend there's
[1:13:01] difference between sons and servants
[1:13:02] right a servant is like the devil amen
[1:13:05] he you know you know he's a fired
[1:13:07] servant you know angels are servants
[1:13:09] they're not the royal family amen
[1:13:11] they're not made in the image of God
[1:13:13] Amen they are not his offspring none of
[1:13:15] his dnf and put it that way is in his uh
[1:13:18] in the Angels they are servants they are
[1:13:20] made to be servants but then the devil
[1:13:23] because of Pride Rose above his job
[1:13:25] description and he got
[1:13:27] fired that's what happened but he got
[1:13:29] real upset about it he says I'm going to
[1:13:31] I'm going to take over the company but
[1:13:33] God says you can't take over my company
[1:13:35] you can't take over amen so so he so
[1:13:37] he's a fired servant so he's lost his
[1:13:41] authority that he once had as an
[1:13:43] archangel in heaven but you got to
[1:13:45] realize that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] puts us back into a position of
[1:13:48] authority amen because remember God made
[1:13:51] Man In His Image and
[1:13:54] Adam and Eve had total dominion over the
[1:13:56] Earth right they they had they could
[1:13:59] they could just speak a word they had
[1:14:00] total Dominion right but they fell from
[1:14:03] that position amen but God said I will
[1:14:05] restore amen I'm going to restore I'm
[1:14:07] going to restore man back to the
[1:14:09] original position that's why Jesus when
[1:14:11] he when he came he was the second Adam
[1:14:13] amen and he showed he had dominion over
[1:14:15] nature he had dominion over death he had
[1:14:18] dominion over everything that could be
[1:14:19] named and he didn't just in this realm
[1:14:21] but he went down to Hell to show I have
[1:14:23] Domin over hell death in the grave amen
[1:14:25] Satan and all of us ho so that was the
[1:14:27] first I mean that was the second Adam
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ now we know there has to be
[1:14:32] a second Eve right we're going back to a
[1:14:35] man and a woman in a
[1:14:37] garden amen but God is making such a way
[1:14:40] that we can never leave the garden
[1:14:41] Hallelujah the devil because the devil
[1:14:43] will be no more but he'll make us in
[1:14:45] such a way that we cannot fall right and
[1:14:48] it's the same thing with a redeemed son
[1:14:51] or daughter of God if you're sealed into
[1:14:52] the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost sure you may have a lot of trouble
[1:14:56] you'll have mind battles you'll have
[1:14:57] struggles but you can never ever go back
[1:15:00] to being dead in darkness and sin and
[1:15:02] unbelief ever again because you are
[1:15:05] sealed in amen you're not you're not
[1:15:07] just put in you're sealed in amen if God
[1:15:10] has sealed you and the devil can't
[1:15:11] unbreak the seal amen cuz sure we can
[1:15:14] grieve the Holy Ghost we can do all
[1:15:15] those things but that that does not mean
[1:15:17] you've lost your salvation just like
[1:15:19] David when he you know when he when he
[1:15:21] got to a spot in his life where he
[1:15:22] thought he doesn't need to go fight
[1:15:23] anymore he's just going to sit in the
[1:15:25] palace and enjoy everything and kind
[1:15:27] well brother said he backslid you know
[1:15:29] then he looked at bashra and all that
[1:15:31] chaos happened in in the kingdom and he
[1:15:33] wrote that Psalm restore unto me the joy
[1:15:36] of my salvation and the prophet said
[1:15:38] look he didn't say restore my salvation
[1:15:40] no he said restore the joy of it amen so
[1:15:43] so he never lost his salvation we lost
[1:15:45] the joy of his salvation so we can lose
[1:15:47] the joy but doesn't mean we lose our
[1:15:49] Salvation amen so the thing is right God
[1:15:51] can seal us into the kingdom by the Holy
[1:15:53] Ghost we can never fall like Adam and
[1:15:55] Eve did right because we've gone from
[1:15:59] Death to life right they went from life
[1:16:01] to death but they had nothing that could
[1:16:03] come at that time to take them back to
[1:16:04] life again right so our souls have gone
[1:16:07] back from unbelief to Faith amen you can
[1:16:10] say our souls are in the same are in the
[1:16:12] same condition as Adam and Eve were
[1:16:14] before the fall right sure these bodies
[1:16:16] going to be changed but our souls that's
[1:16:18] why we may have battles in our mind
[1:16:19] doesn't mean we're not a Believer
[1:16:20] doesn't mean we're not an overcomer we
[1:16:22] may have sickness that doesn't change
[1:16:24] nothing about us being Overcomers right
[1:16:26] because our but the devil can't he can't
[1:16:29] attack our souls those are secure I mean
[1:16:31] as long as in our souls we say Amen to
[1:16:34] every word there's something that says
[1:16:36] this word is true I may be wrong but
[1:16:38] this word is always right amen I say
[1:16:40] Amen to every word there's something in
[1:16:42] you saying it not consciously
[1:16:43] subconsciously you agree to the word
[1:16:45] what's that you've changed from Death to
[1:16:47] life amen that goes beyond all
[1:16:49] Sensations manifestations it's got to
[1:16:51] come down to something conrete which is
[1:16:54] something in The Believer says Amen to
[1:16:57] every word hallelujah so so we have you
[1:16:59] know so we are standing so as Jesus was
[1:17:02] the second Adam we are the bride of
[1:17:04] Christ as the second Eve amen so so now
[1:17:07] remember Jesus said all power in heaven
[1:17:08] Earth is given unto me now now where did
[1:17:11] he put that power he placed it in his
[1:17:13] church amen that he would come down into
[1:17:16] his church or his bride and manifest
[1:17:18] that power and authority amen so that's
[1:17:20] why the blood of Jesus Christ we got to
[1:17:22] realize we safe and secure amen amen if
[1:17:25] you're under the blood you're safe amen
[1:17:27] there's nothing see the devil would come
[1:17:29] and try and harm you but you would have
[1:17:30] realize actually no I'm secure you have
[1:17:33] a right to withstand the enemy you got a
[1:17:35] right to cast him out you've got a right
[1:17:37] to deny him and turn him down and you
[1:17:40] know expose him for who he is you have a
[1:17:41] right by the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:44] to stand in God's given privileges that
[1:17:47] the Lord has given you amen so Lord so
[1:17:50] now as we're reading there in in um
[1:17:54] Joseph's life now we know Joseph was a
[1:17:57] perfect type of Christ he was spiritual
[1:17:59] amen he was hated of his Brethren
[1:18:01] because they were jealous his father
[1:18:03] gave him a coat of many colors amen a
[1:18:05] covenant coat rainbow coat amen just as
[1:18:07] our lord Jesus is a covenant given to
[1:18:09] him amen of you know of life you know
[1:18:11] the Jewish his Jewish Brothers should
[1:18:13] have loved him but they hat him because
[1:18:14] they were jealous even pilate realized
[1:18:17] the reason the Jews had had Jesus
[1:18:19] crucified because of Envy they were
[1:18:21] jealous of him you think about here's
[1:18:23] this you know you know the generations
[1:18:25] of of of of a family have been studying
[1:18:28] the Torah studying the Bible trying to
[1:18:30] but they can't make one promise come to
[1:18:32] pass they can't make one thing move am
[1:18:34] mean they're still controlled by the
[1:18:35] Romans you know the you they're just
[1:18:37] looking at prophecy debating and slicing
[1:18:39] words and just looking at meanings and
[1:18:40] things but here comes a Man Out of Here
[1:18:43] Comes A Man from Nazareth he does he
[1:18:45] didn't come out of any of the lineages
[1:18:47] amen but he just spoke a word he didn't
[1:18:49] debate the devil he just said go amen he
[1:18:51] had he had total total control he spoke
[1:18:53] things amen that that that even Jesus
[1:18:56] said the prophets wanted to hear these
[1:18:57] things you hear yes you know and they
[1:19:00] were jealous of him yeah because the
[1:19:02] people the people loved him you know
[1:19:04] when Jesus said you know you scribes and
[1:19:06] Pharisees you know you lawyers you know
[1:19:08] you Heap burdens upon people and and
[1:19:10] those things you won't even touch with
[1:19:11] your finger when the people heard that
[1:19:13] they said they would have said that's
[1:19:14] true they would have realized man these
[1:19:17] guys don't love us They Don't Care About
[1:19:19] Us they just want to exercise lordship
[1:19:21] over us and control us but here come but
[1:19:24] this man but this man's a different kind
[1:19:26] of a man amen he wants us to be free he
[1:19:28] wants us to know God he doesn't want us
[1:19:30] separation he wants to reveal the father
[1:19:32] to us amen he wants us to know the truth
[1:19:34] of the word amen and that's why they
[1:19:36] loved him but they were jealous so they
[1:19:39] crucified him amen so so Joseph's
[1:19:42] brothers were were jealous of him you
[1:19:46] see so he was sold for you know um
[1:19:48] however many pieces of silver just like
[1:19:50] Judas sold sold Jesus you went down to
[1:19:53] Egypt you know then he was then he was
[1:19:55] there in prison there were two two
[1:19:56] prisoners with him you know the Butler
[1:19:58] and the Baker and hopefully I don't get
[1:20:00] this wrong but the baker died and the
[1:20:02] butler got restored I think that's how
[1:20:03] it was the two thieves were hanging on
[1:20:05] the cross with Jesus one went to
[1:20:07] Paradise one was lost you know and then
[1:20:09] and then after Jesus rose you know he's
[1:20:11] at the right hand of the you authority
[1:20:13] of you of the Majesty on high just like
[1:20:15] Joseph was exalted to the right hand of
[1:20:17] pharaoh amen but now now there's an in
[1:20:20] between stage because when this happens
[1:20:23] in this when this happens he gets a
[1:20:25] gentile bride amen he get because
[1:20:28] remember every Christ type in the
[1:20:29] scripture marries a gentile Moses
[1:20:31] married a gentile amen Solomon of Judah
[1:20:34] married Rahab a gentile Boaz married
[1:20:37] Ruth a gentile amen so there's many
[1:20:39] Gentiles through the scripture amen
[1:20:41] speaking of speaking of us isn't it
[1:20:44] amazing when you can look at the Shadow
[1:20:45] and something and you says that's you
[1:20:48] something in you says that's you it's
[1:20:49] not you trying to find a place it's like
[1:20:51] the chief director come comes along says
[1:20:53] this is your
[1:20:54] role amen this is your role he say I'm
[1:20:57] not prepared he says don't worry I'll
[1:20:58] prepare you for the role because I see
[1:21:00] equality within you that you don't even
[1:21:02] see necessarily amen you know many times
[1:21:05] we think lord well I think it quite
[1:21:07] often some Lord why did you even save me
[1:21:09] this guy you know let's be honest
[1:21:12] sometimes you even wrestle with God's
[1:21:14] gra Lord why did you give me you know
[1:21:16] your grace why am I beneficiary of your
[1:21:18] blood and it it's simply just is because
[1:21:21] I chose you y
[1:21:23] goes beyond this thing it goes into a c
[1:21:25] Gene of election in here amen but you
[1:21:28] see now Jo Joseph married a gentile
[1:21:31] bride now there she was she was a she
[1:21:35] was a daughter of a priest so she came
[1:21:37] out of a place of
[1:21:39] idolatry we all had our Idols oh yeah
[1:21:42] someone asked me on the phone other
[1:21:43] think it was yesterday what's an
[1:21:46] idol I said well it's anything that you
[1:21:49] worship above the word of God as an idol
[1:21:52] anything it can be it could be your job
[1:21:54] yourself it can be your it can be your
[1:21:56] hobbies it can be you know your family
[1:21:58] it can be anything can even be your
[1:22:00] church people can worship we're not here
[1:22:02] to worship this building or a name well
[1:22:04] the only name we here to worship is the
[1:22:06] Lord Jesus Christ but you see you know
[1:22:07] but anything that gets in the between
[1:22:09] you and God's word is an idol and
[1:22:12] then and then even people splice and cut
[1:22:14] the word to make an
[1:22:16] idol that's right that's what the
[1:22:18] Egyptians did they took the attributes
[1:22:21] of God made it a
[1:22:23] God they split God up we can't split God
[1:22:25] up he's one the whole word I want I want
[1:22:29] the cover also you know I believe it
[1:22:30] from cover to cover and the cover also
[1:22:32] amen I'll take it all amen it says holy
[1:22:35] Bible amen the word's holy hallelujah
[1:22:37] praise the Lord amen so she came out of
[1:22:41] a she came out of a um a long line of
[1:22:45] idolatry but you see she was
[1:22:48] predestinated to a different position
[1:22:50] God didn't want her to to be an idol wor
[1:22:52] worshiper though that's how she is
[1:22:54] raised but you know we know that when a
[1:22:56] when a when a woman marries a man that
[1:22:58] she takes on his identity that her her
[1:23:01] old identity is gone amen her old name
[1:23:04] is gone there's a name change goes on
[1:23:06] signifying a change of life there's a
[1:23:08] change you know there was a time when my
[1:23:10] wife was a r now she's a
[1:23:13] glowing
[1:23:14] glory amen you know and you know yeah so
[1:23:19] that's just how it is praise God there
[1:23:21] was one time time I was United to Satan
[1:23:25] by first Birth by that first
[1:23:28] nature I was called by his name because
[1:23:30] I was doing his acts it says in you know
[1:23:32] Ephesians chapter 2 that we all walked
[1:23:35] according to the prince of the power of
[1:23:36] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:23:38] the children of Disobedience right it
[1:23:40] doesn't say disobedient children
[1:23:41] children disobedient anyway that's
[1:23:42] another thing but you know so so I was
[1:23:44] United to him by that first nature so I
[1:23:47] was called by his name and I his life
[1:23:49] was lived out of me amen but then one
[1:23:51] day God came and interrupted that Union
[1:23:55] amen he interrupted that Union that that
[1:23:57] first nature just wasn't put away in a
[1:23:59] closet somewhere to be a plan B if
[1:24:01] things go funny if things go hard no
[1:24:03] that guy died am me that's why you got
[1:24:06] to come to a real repentance where where
[1:24:08] there's a death to self amen like the
[1:24:10] prodical son brother Bley was talking to
[1:24:11] me about it you know when the prodical
[1:24:13] son returned back to his father he said
[1:24:15] I've sinned against God and you many
[1:24:17] people just say oh I've done you wrong
[1:24:19] no he he acknowledged his sins were
[1:24:21] affecting God
[1:24:23] first and then affecting the father you
[1:24:25] see and that's a real
[1:24:27] repentance amen but you know you aren't
[1:24:29] you glad that day where that first guy
[1:24:31] died that first nature there a cruel
[1:24:33] Master made you do things you didn't
[1:24:35] want to do dragging you around causing
[1:24:36] you trouble amen but then that nature
[1:24:39] died so you United to another prise the
[1:24:42] Lord hallelujah amen that that you know
[1:24:45] that now you become amen Mrs Jesus
[1:24:48] Christ amen that's why it's so important
[1:24:51] we're baptized in his name amen we are
[1:24:54] baptized in his name because we are
[1:24:55] called by his name and we we're showing
[1:24:58] this world in the Unseen World we are
[1:25:01] now identified with the word of God
[1:25:04] we're not identified with culture or
[1:25:05] Creed or denomination we are identified
[1:25:08] with the word of God that's why we take
[1:25:09] on the name of the word which is the
[1:25:11] Lord Jesus Christ amen so now now now
[1:25:14] this um um asath amen she went from
[1:25:17] being the daughter of Piper the priest
[1:25:20] of an to becoming m is Zapf pan now this
[1:25:24] is significant amen because now the now
[1:25:26] now there's different meanings to this
[1:25:28] name but you know this is this is one
[1:25:31] meaning I found God speaks and he lives
[1:25:34] amen so now now Joseph was called this
[1:25:37] because they saw that living in him
[1:25:40] because remember when when Joseph came
[1:25:42] before Pharaoh God was going to speak
[1:25:45] and they knew as conduct in the prison
[1:25:47] they knew that now it wasn't just an
[1:25:49] idol of stone and wood and different
[1:25:51] things the egyp Egyptians had but God
[1:25:53] put on flesh and God actually you could
[1:25:55] say in a way walked into Pharaoh's Court
[1:25:58] just like he did in Moses a few hundred
[1:26:00] years after this but but but here was
[1:26:02] and and then so they they identified the
[1:26:04] spirit of God was in this man was in
[1:26:06] Joseph so they so so his name was
[1:26:08] changed Amen to zapan which one of the
[1:26:11] meanings is revealer of Secrets which is
[1:26:13] all true as well but God speaks and he
[1:26:15] lives I mean so now now Mrs Zapf panea
[1:26:20] took on this name I mean so now she
[1:26:23] begin to manifest because we manifest
[1:26:25] the life of our husband talking am mean
[1:26:28] we so we manifest the life of our
[1:26:30] husband right so if you're if you're
[1:26:32] United to Christ you'll manifest the
[1:26:34] word amen if you're not you won't amen
[1:26:36] so we want to be United with him amen so
[1:26:40] now so now here she is she was
[1:26:41] worshiping dead Idols sure they would
[1:26:44] have had a lot of music and ceremony and
[1:26:45] all these things in their in their
[1:26:47] temples but but but God God revealed
[1:26:51] himself to her to show this is me I'm
[1:26:55] alive I'm here to fulfill the word I'm
[1:26:57] here to fulfill prophecy amen and so
[1:27:00] that so so she begin to Manifest this
[1:27:02] that God speaks and he lives now we are
[1:27:06] in the same boat amen as the Bride of
[1:27:09] Jesus Christ I could say hello Mr ZF P
[1:27:12] how you doing
[1:27:13] today amen why because because your
[1:27:16] testimony is God speaks and he lives not
[1:27:19] just that he has spoken but there's a
[1:27:21] living voice upon the Earth that he not
[1:27:24] just lived but lives amen that he's the
[1:27:26] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:27:28] he's not just a historical God or a
[1:27:31] future God but he's a present God Amen
[1:27:34] and this is to me what was so powerful
[1:27:35] about Camp God spoke and he lives amen
[1:27:39] he oh man it was just so just I thought
[1:27:42] just masterpieces of sermons The Devil
[1:27:43] just getting so exposed at every every
[1:27:46] angle amen and you know and you just
[1:27:49] just such an encouraging you know
[1:27:51] encouraging word and things so I'm just
[1:27:53] trying to back in behind that you know
[1:27:55] come in behind that the we realize that
[1:27:57] you know we are called by a different
[1:27:59] name we have a high and holy calling
[1:28:02] amen and if God has placed you in that
[1:28:04] calling that's your calling amen just
[1:28:06] like her she was once a priest's um
[1:28:10] daughter but now she's United to Joseph
[1:28:12] her life changed you know and maybe
[1:28:16] maybe because those things were familiar
[1:28:18] maybe there was mind battles I don't
[1:28:19] know maybe people would say remember you
[1:28:20] were that PR you know remember your dad
[1:28:22] potterer and what you used to do in the
[1:28:24] temple with him and you'd say yeah used
[1:28:27] to I'm not that I'm not that woman
[1:28:29] anymore I'm not that person anymore I've
[1:28:32] been I've been United to Joseph and his
[1:28:35] God Lives amen and because you know we
[1:28:38] are one amen so my identity is not in
[1:28:40] what I used to be it's in what I am now
[1:28:43] Hallelujah by Christ amen Lord
[1:28:46] hallelujah so God speaks and he lives
[1:28:48] now we know we are the body of Christ
[1:28:51] amen we are the body Body of Christ I I
[1:28:53] I just I just pray that the Lord would
[1:28:55] just you
[1:28:56] know remember the scripture says I don't
[1:28:58] have it that we would know as we are
[1:29:00] knowing right so we'd come to a place
[1:29:02] where we know as God knows us right now
[1:29:06] there may be a lot of you know a lot of
[1:29:08] things that you know about yourself that
[1:29:10] have to be done away with okay that's
[1:29:12] what the word does Amen reveals our true
[1:29:15] identity beauti and we and God wants us
[1:29:17] to walk in that identity amen he wants
[1:29:20] us to embody that identity amen because
[1:29:23] it's not just a tag it's a
[1:29:25] life amen so now so this speaking of Our
[1:29:30] Lord who is the image of the invisible
[1:29:31] God the firstborn of every creature for
[1:29:33] by him are all things created that are
[1:29:35] in heaven they are in Earth visible
[1:29:37] invisible where they be Thrones or
[1:29:38] dominions principalities or Powers all
[1:29:40] things are created by Him and for him
[1:29:42] and he is before all things and by him
[1:29:44] all things consist and he is the head of
[1:29:46] the body by the church who is the
[1:29:48] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:29:50] that is in all things he might have the
[1:29:51] preeminence uh for for it please the
[1:29:54] father that in him should all fullness
[1:29:56] dwell amen so so we are the body and he
[1:29:59] is the
[1:30:00] head amen and we're going to realize
[1:30:03] that who has ever seen no no one has
[1:30:05] ever seen a headless body that lives and
[1:30:08] has fun talking about a human okay there
[1:30:11] has to be the so the head has to be
[1:30:13] there to have life right so we're here
[1:30:16] so so we are not a headless body we're
[1:30:19] not here just trying to work out how to
[1:30:21] walk with God in our own ability no we
[1:30:24] have the headship of Christ amen we have
[1:30:26] his word we have his anointing amen that
[1:30:28] when we can that we can turn to him for
[1:30:31] leadership amen we can not our feelings
[1:30:34] not what we think is all going on but we
[1:30:36] can turn to him for leadership and God
[1:30:38] can guide us through cuz this is a very
[1:30:40] foggy day right but it's also a very
[1:30:43] bright day amen so sure there's fog but
[1:30:46] there's brightness as well of the of the
[1:30:48] coming of the Lord amen so we can walk
[1:30:50] in confidence I believe that we this is
[1:30:52] just me I feel that we're more confident
[1:30:54] in our walk with God than we were 10
[1:30:55] years ago who feels that way sure you've
[1:30:58] gone through a lot of things you've had
[1:30:59] a lot of trouble but you know but God's
[1:31:01] brought you through right he's given you
[1:31:04] overcoming power right he has he has
[1:31:06] stabilized your life Hallelujah what's
[1:31:08] he doing he's revealing to you who you
[1:31:10] really are amen because you no longer
[1:31:13] think the way you used to amen you think
[1:31:15] differently God's been honing your
[1:31:16] thinking and ways why cuz he's showing
[1:31:18] no this is who you really are that guy
[1:31:21] is not who you are this is who you
[1:31:22] really are but he shows it in your life
[1:31:25] I'm glad how God does it hallelujah amen
[1:31:28] amen glory amen it would say in
[1:31:30] Ephesians that the whole family in
[1:31:32] Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ
[1:31:35] amen so we take on his name we take on

[1:32:00] Heavens that makes me happy you know but
[1:32:02] but we're not just living on enthusiasm
[1:32:05] because enthusiasm comes to an end amen
[1:32:07] all human motion comes to an end but
[1:32:09] Revelation cannot end am mean Revelation

[1:32:13] it's been revealed to you am mean that
[1:32:15] he is your Lord he's your lord and
[1:32:17] savior that can't come to an end how can

[1:32:24] hallelujah so so there is an anointed
[1:32:26] bride body upon the Earth just like the
[1:32:30] your asath became Mrs Zapf pan amen
[1:32:34] where she she was called by his name and
[1:32:36] she began to express that name because
[1:32:38] they are one husband and wife are one
[1:32:41] amen so now so so where the head is the
[1:32:43] body must be
[1:32:44] also that's right amen so where the head
[1:32:47] is the body must be also so we're going
[1:32:49] to realize that we are never out of his
[1:32:51] presence
[1:32:52] am amen he said I never leave thee nor
[1:32:54] forsake thee just just just you know you
[1:32:57] know he said never leave us nor forsake
[1:32:58] us if we don't feel it that doesn't mean
[1:33:01] he's not there we don't have to have a
[1:33:03] nighttime service at Camp to realize
[1:33:05] he's with us a mean we can feel as dead
[1:33:07] as a post but that's feelings feelings
[1:33:09] come feelings go but the peace of God
[1:33:11] you all know okay so we can we can stand
[1:33:14] on the fact that God has called us by
[1:33:16] his word and if he's called us he's
[1:33:18] going to keep us in that position amen
[1:33:21] remember this is the hour where God
[1:33:22] calls his bride through a word remember
[1:33:24] this message is not a church call it's
[1:33:27] not a foolish virgin call it is a
[1:33:29] bridegroom call Brother Ram says the
[1:33:31] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:33:32] this word and gather his elect amen so
[1:33:35] so just as just as Joseph was given amen
[1:33:39] his wife so the bride has been prepared
[1:33:42] for her
[1:33:43] bridegroom amen praise God I'm glad
[1:33:47] we're not just fumbling around on
[1:33:49] sometimes we feel like we're fumbling
[1:33:50] around but God God is directing our
[1:33:52] steps God is directing our steps he's
[1:33:55] even through hardship and trial you know
[1:33:57] many times God ain't you know God loves
[1:34:01] us with an unfailing love right he is
[1:34:05] not a god waiting to to to kick us when
[1:34:07] we're down he's not waiting for us to
[1:34:10] fail and then show us you know make us
[1:34:13] feel bad cuz we fail no he wants to
[1:34:17] reveal himself in the fall amen because
[1:34:19] it's not him that fall him that gets
[1:34:21] back up that's an overcomer right so
[1:34:23] sure we fall and fail but as long as we
[1:34:24] get back up amen we've
[1:34:27] overcome amen cuz why we have proven
[1:34:30] that that thing that made us fall is not
[1:34:31] going to keep us on the ground see the
[1:34:33] devil wants to pin us to the mat in the
[1:34:35] ring amen but no we may be knocked out
[1:34:37] but we're getting back up hallelujah
[1:34:39] amen just get back up on your feet
[1:34:40] doesn't matter what it is say Lord your
[1:34:42] blood is more than enough Hallelujah
[1:34:44] Lord forgive me one more time try me one
[1:34:46] more time lord I want to walk with you
[1:34:49] hallelujah amen that's why we can we can
[1:34:51] such I don't know I just have such
[1:34:53] confidence that if we just surrender to
[1:34:55] the word of God like never before God
[1:34:57] will prove that word like never before I
[1:34:59] mean if we just because remember if you
[1:35:01] have see if we see if the devil can put
[1:35:03] a shadow on the word saying are you sure
[1:35:06] it will work then your confidence will
[1:35:08] go upon yourself yeah because you're not
[1:35:11] sure if you can really TR yeah sure you
[1:35:12] can kind of trust a bit but he says how
[1:35:14] do you know it's going to
[1:35:16] work we've seen
[1:35:18] it just just go back in your old just go
[1:35:21] back in your life he said if you repent
[1:35:24] of a baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:26] you shall receive for the for the
[1:35:27] remission of sin you shall receive the
[1:35:28] gift of the Holy Ghost who's seen that
[1:35:31] who's seen that in your own life okay so
[1:35:33] that promise is true but the devil will
[1:35:35] say well what about this promise how do
[1:35:37] you know it's true well the same God
[1:35:39] gave one promise gave the second promise
[1:35:41] he gave the third promise he gave the
[1:35:42] fourth promise he gave all the promises
[1:35:45] right so if he can vindicate One Promise
[1:35:47] in your life he can vindicate prodical
[1:35:50] coming home he can he can vindicate your
[1:35:52] family coming in amen he can vindicate
[1:35:55] healing whatever whatever the promise is
[1:35:57] God is more than able to do it if he did
[1:35:59] that one even you think about it we were
[1:36:01] once his enemy but yet he loved us so we
[1:36:05] our will was actually against him once
[1:36:07] upon a time but yet God still turned you
[1:36:09] around and Vindicated Vindicated his
[1:36:11] word in your life in spite of you am me
[1:36:14] so how much more now are people that
[1:36:16] their hearts are for God Amen maybe once
[1:36:19] upon a time you know as and a thought
[1:36:21] that Joseph was a crazy man I don't know
[1:36:24] who's this guy in jail maybe heard some
[1:36:25] rumors and stuff about him you know so
[1:36:28] her will wouldn't have been United with
[1:36:29] his will but then when they came
[1:36:32] together and were United amen they
[1:36:34] wouldn't had conflicting Wills anymore
[1:36:36] her will his will became her will amen
[1:36:39] so now how much more you and I see the
[1:36:41] most Supernatural thing you'll ever see
[1:36:43] is a soul converted yeah and it can such
[1:36:46] a simple thing where Once Upon a Time
[1:36:49] like brother R said about sister Bruce
[1:36:50] you go look at the message where where
[1:36:52] where where she's there multiple times
[1:36:54] it's not just a private interview that
[1:36:56] she's there but she comes to the altar
[1:36:58] she prays for people all the way through
[1:36:59] the message and she comes down to the
[1:37:01] end of the prophet's Ministry and she
[1:37:02] has this private interview I need to
[1:37:04] know I believe the Lord will show you
[1:37:06] brother Bram where I got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:08] if I do or not and then he just asked a
[1:37:10] simple question once upon a time you
[1:37:11] were going that way and didn't care
[1:37:13] about God but then now something
[1:37:16] happened and now all you care about is
[1:37:18] serving him and living for him what did
[1:37:20] that and she says Christ he says there
[1:37:22] it is that's it see what is your what is
[1:37:25] your motive in your life is it to see
[1:37:28] him live is it to see that others would
[1:37:30] know him is it that he would live or not
[1:37:33] you that when God does anything in your
[1:37:36] life you're not included in the picture
[1:37:38] you're not even in the testimony because
[1:37:39] it's God's testimony right you just want
[1:37:41] to live live for him you read his word
[1:37:43] say Lord change me to match your word
[1:37:45] Lord I believe that's the heart of the
[1:37:47] Bride amen that all we care about is
[1:37:49] Lord change my nature and all that I am
[1:37:51] hallah that that that that your heart
[1:37:54] becomes flesh in me your desires your
[1:37:57] motives your objectives your word
[1:37:59] becomes flesh in me there's no longer I
[1:38:01] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:38:03] you know that's a supernatural desire
[1:38:06] who put that there God put that in you
[1:38:07] you didn't put that in there God put
[1:38:09] that in you why but what's happened cuz
[1:38:11] I believe because a Union's taking place
[1:38:13] and then you can look back and see you
[1:38:14] can see God's hand that's why Mark 16
[1:38:16] and action is the true church these
[1:38:18] signs shall follow them that believe so
[1:38:21] you walk and you see signs following not
[1:38:23] leading following what's leading you has
[1:38:26] still Small Voice cuz my sheep know my
[1:38:28] voice is stranger they not follow amen
[1:38:30] so you see God's voice leading you and
[1:38:33] then you see signs following you well
[1:38:35] how often do I need to see them to
[1:38:37] vindicate you know that signs follow me
[1:38:39] no God will take care of that it's not
[1:38:42] you that does the supernatural by the
[1:38:43] way it's him right you just be yielded
[1:38:46] to a spirit be lead and God will do
[1:38:47] those things amen praise the a
[1:38:52] lord now if we go
[1:38:56] to if we go to um so I'm just now we're
[1:39:00] just going to read this and maybe I'm
[1:39:02] going to yeah well I'm about to close
[1:39:05] I'll do a brother Kyra so now and there
[1:39:07] was war in heaven Michael and his Angel
[1:39:10] fought against the dragon this is one of
[1:39:11] my favorite scriptures this is one of my
[1:39:13] favorite scriptures because it shows the
[1:39:15] devil lost the beginning and he loses at
[1:39:18] the end but then also I into the picture
[1:39:21] too cuz they overcame him who's are
[1:39:25] they that's you isn't it amazing before
[1:39:28] you born God saw you cuz remember
[1:39:31] hallelujah hallelujah see prophecy when
[1:39:34] God speaks it it can be a sentence but
[1:39:36] God knows the people he knows the
[1:39:38] conditions he knows when they're born
[1:39:40] everything that all the details of their
[1:39:42] life for that person that goes into that
[1:39:43] prophecy just like how you know God told
[1:39:46] Abraham you know your seed's going to be
[1:39:47] in Egypt 400 years I'm going to bring
[1:39:49] them out with a mighty hand and that
[1:39:50] prophet phy was Moses and that prophecy
[1:39:52] was a pharaoh that didn't that didn't
[1:39:54] know Joseph and that prophecy was the
[1:39:56] boys being thrown into the Nile and that
[1:39:58] prophecy was Israel becoming slaves it
[1:40:00] was all in there and the and that
[1:40:02] prophecy was the 10 plagues in Egypt and
[1:40:04] that prophecy was the Red Sea and that
[1:40:07] prophecy was the task Masters drowning
[1:40:08] in the Red Sea I mean in that prophecy
[1:40:10] was the blood being applied it was all
[1:40:12] in there Hallelujah so many times we
[1:40:14] think it's just a condensed I don't know
[1:40:16] how many seconds to read a verse but
[1:40:18] you're in there yes Hallelujah you're in
[1:40:20] there amen so isn't it neat that you
[1:40:22] know in the beginning let's just yeah
[1:40:25] you if you ever feel bad just you feel
[1:40:27] down just read this this will make you
[1:40:29] happy amen there was war in heaven
[1:40:32] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:40:34] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[1:40:35] angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:40:37] their place found anymore in heaven he
[1:40:40] lost he lost okay and he's a creature of
[1:40:43] habit he loses he's a deceiver you know
[1:40:47] it takes the Holy Ghost to outsmart him
[1:40:50] but he loses okay amen and the Great
[1:40:53] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[1:40:54] called the devil and Satan which
[1:40:56] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:40:58] out into the Earth and his angels were
[1:40:59] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:41:01] voice saying in heaven now has come
[1:41:03] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:41:04] of our God and the power of His Christ
[1:41:06] for the accuser our Brethren is cast
[1:41:08] down which accused him before our God
[1:41:10] day and night and they overcame him yeah
[1:41:13] here I am here you are amen inter stage
[1:41:16] left you okay they overcame and by the
[1:41:19] blood of the lamb and by by the word of
[1:41:21] their testimony and they love not their
[1:41:23] lives unto the death amen so this is how
[1:41:26] we overcome by the blood of the Lamb
[1:41:28] that we're not we don't overcome by our
[1:41:30] own ability we overcome by the power of
[1:41:32] his blood me by the perfect sacrifice I
[1:41:35] think brother Isaac Hatfield preached he
[1:41:36] said the perfect blood perfectly loose
[1:41:39] the people am amen but the devil says
[1:41:42] are you sure it does oh yeah well you're
[1:41:44] not here anymore you're way over there
[1:41:46] somewhere you know you've been loose for
[1:41:48] my life you don't control me see there's
[1:41:50] a big difference between the devil
[1:41:51] controlling and just trying to influence
[1:41:54] right we got to always differentiate
[1:41:56] because the the devil trying he he he
[1:41:58] hates to lose a soul right because all
[1:42:01] he wants is to take a one son or
[1:42:03] daughter of God to hell and he's one but
[1:42:05] God can't lose one of his so the devil
[1:42:07] always try and and and and influence
[1:42:10] your mind your thinking right remember
[1:42:12] but you can't stop the thoughts coming
[1:42:14] but you can stop how they affect you
[1:42:16] right so you can either embrace them and
[1:42:18] then and then embody those thoughts or
[1:42:20] you can take a double barrel shotgun of
[1:42:22] an Old and New Testament am me and blast
[1:42:24] that thing to smotherin like brother R
[1:42:26] says like like birds like we you got
[1:42:28] sparrows here you can't do it but he
[1:42:30] said about crows they'll you know
[1:42:31] they'll build a nest and you know they
[1:42:33] and then if you allow them to build that
[1:42:35] nest and they have children they'll grow
[1:42:36] they more and more and more crows it's
[1:42:37] like thoughts you can let it come it can
[1:42:39] start building a nest get bigger it can
[1:42:41] have children can grow and expand become
[1:42:43] more real or you can be like a farmer
[1:42:45] with a shotgun and say I'm not having
[1:42:47] this thing this carrying thing that
[1:42:49] doesn't belong on my farm I'm nesting on
[1:42:51] my property you get your shotgun and
[1:42:53] blasted the smother Rings it's the same
[1:42:55] thing so so how do you do that you take
[1:42:56] the word of God that's contrary to that
[1:42:58] thought and say I believe that word Lord
[1:43:01] so when the devil says you're alone
[1:43:02] you're never going to make it you blast
[1:43:04] that thing away by saying here is my
[1:43:05] present help and time of trouble he's my
[1:43:07] shield he's my reward he's my shepherd
[1:43:09] he's my salvation He's My Redeemer he's
[1:43:12] my king of kings he's my Lord of lords
[1:43:14] he's my God and by the end of the when
[1:43:16] you stop finishing quoting that you'll
[1:43:18] be feeling rejoicing and shouting you
[1:43:20] not be able to remember chapter and
[1:43:22] verse but if you know the attributes of
[1:43:24] God you'll be shouting by the end of
[1:43:25] that by the end of that blasting
[1:43:28] amen amen so this is what we're going to
[1:43:31] do Hallelujah is is is that we're going
[1:43:34] to blast the thoughts of the devil away
[1:43:36] you know like you know like you with
[1:43:38] Brother Isaac Hatfield I only heard him
[1:43:39] preach once in my life just on tape you
[1:43:41] know but then when brother Andrew said
[1:43:43] he couldn't come and things were
[1:43:44] arranged differently I felt more excited
[1:43:46] about Camp you know than before cuz I
[1:43:48] saw God's hand but then the devil was
[1:43:50] like like well how do you know it's
[1:43:51] going to go well you've only heard him
[1:43:53] once he's just 24 you know what if it
[1:43:56] bombs now I could have listened to that
[1:44:00] or I could have got a shotgun out and
[1:44:02] said the shepherd has rearranged what's
[1:44:05] going on not me he has rearranged it
[1:44:07] it's going to be a glorious time see you
[1:44:09] see I could listen to the Mind battle
[1:44:11] you know because there's always fear
[1:44:12] comes in you know the devil never brings
[1:44:16] stability you know you begin to feel
[1:44:18] down and anxious and stressed
[1:44:21] that ain't God that ain't God that you
[1:44:24] you got to look at the proof of the
[1:44:25] pudding you know you can have a see it
[1:44:29] says it's water but it's when you drink
[1:44:31] it you know it's water or not it could
[1:44:33] be any any solvent any any any liquid
[1:44:36] that's colorless and there's a lot of
[1:44:37] different ones right so it's like a
[1:44:40] thought can sound so good but what's it
[1:44:41] doing to you what's it producing am mean
[1:44:44] does it produce Joy a greater love and
[1:44:47] appreciation for the Lord a greater love
[1:44:49] for your family for one another you know
[1:44:51] does it make it make you love people
[1:44:53] more cuz that's God right to have a
[1:44:56] feeling for people that's God giving you
[1:44:57] that feeling to a care and a burden a
[1:44:59] concern and a love you know that's God's
[1:45:01] thoughts Hallelujah right you you know
[1:45:04] you love the word more that's God's
[1:45:05] thoughts right but then if the Devil
[1:45:07] comes in and you're feeling down and oh
[1:45:09] the you it's never going to work for you
[1:45:11] I don't know if this really works you
[1:45:13] know I don't I don't know if it's going
[1:45:14] to help me you know I'm just in this
[1:45:15] trouble and I don't see I don't know how
[1:45:17] I'm going to get out I just I guess it's
[1:45:18] just how I am you know that a't God uh
[1:45:22] and that ain't you that's the devil you
[1:45:24] see so any thought that makes you feel
[1:45:27] isolated shall up troubled insecure down
[1:45:31] depressed that's not God right so that's
[1:45:34] why we got to take the word of God and
[1:45:36] blast that thing out am remember you're
[1:45:38] armed and dangerous amen you're armed
[1:45:40] and dangerous from the oldest to the
[1:45:43] youngest of us you're armed and
[1:45:45] dangerous even even like little Willam
[1:45:46] me sing sometimes Jesus loves me this I
[1:45:48] know that's like grenad being thrown
[1:45:51] over in Devil's Kingdom to me that's
[1:45:53] powerful that's like a bomb growing off
[1:45:55] why cuz it can change your whole
[1:45:56] atmosphere Hallelujah it can and it's
[1:45:58] just a little kid just wandering around
[1:46:00] doing this thing you know so never
[1:46:02] underestimate your
[1:46:04] weapon you just we should just pull the
[1:46:06] safety off Hallelujah no warning shots
[1:46:09] we shoot to kill okay we shoot to kill
[1:46:11] then we go home okay take a photo
[1:46:13] testimony and go home you know let's not
[1:46:15] let's not muck around with the devil no
[1:46:17] more I'm speaking to myself as well but
[1:46:20] you know well you know that won't work
[1:46:22] cuz you've been with you know I've been
[1:46:23] with you so long oh there's got to come
[1:46:25] a time when the when the relationship
[1:46:27] ends amen hallelujah amen we're we're
[1:46:30] sure see see the thing is familiar
[1:46:33] spirits are familiar so so so you get
[1:46:36] used to thinking a certain way it become
[1:46:38] sick nature to think a certain because
[1:46:40] remember the devil wants to change our
[1:46:42] thinking now I can't remember who what
[1:46:44] politician it was in some debate but
[1:46:46] they're talking about something and and
[1:46:48] and and this politician said you have no
[1:46:49] right to change the thinking of my
[1:46:51] people to match what you're trying to do
[1:46:54] and that's what the devil does he's
[1:46:55] trying to change our thinking to make us
[1:46:58] think differently about the word of God
[1:47:00] and about ourselves he's trying to
[1:47:02] change The Narrative of
[1:47:06] History come on now to make us think
[1:47:08] differently you see we can't we can't
[1:47:11] let him do it see and he wants you to
[1:47:13] think differently about yourself he's
[1:47:15] never going to say stand on my neck cast
[1:47:18] me out expose me for who I yeah no no I
[1:47:21] am a Tormentor that's right yes I'm your
[1:47:23] T you know he's never going to tell you
[1:47:25] that he's never going to expose himself
[1:47:28] he's always hides in the shadows I'm not
[1:47:30] trying to make a joke well what don't
[1:47:31] you think about it you know he'll never
[1:47:32] say yeah I'm not God yeah um I have no
[1:47:35] future for you yeah actually all I have
[1:47:37] is a lake of fire it's not even mine and
[1:47:39] I'm going there and I'm trying to take
[1:47:41] you with me you know it's like Delilah
[1:47:43] with Samson she didn't say how can I
[1:47:45] tell me how to destroy you Samson that's
[1:47:47] basically what you were saying oh but I
[1:47:49] thought you love me you there should be
[1:47:51] no secret you manipulation the devil
[1:47:54] manipulates right but yeah she didn't
[1:47:56] say now now Samson look this is my this
[1:47:59] is why I'm here I there's a lot of money
[1:48:02] waiting for me let me tell you how much
[1:48:04] guess how I'm going to get it I need
[1:48:05] your secret so tell me how I can destroy
[1:48:09] you the devil doesn't come that way he
[1:48:10] always comes with a manipulation thing
[1:48:12] the thing is Samson that became a
[1:48:14] familiar spirit in his life and it
[1:48:17] dragged him down but if he just say
[1:48:18] stayed with a source of strength
[1:48:20] that thing never would have overpowered
[1:48:22] him so that's why the devil tries to
[1:48:25] make us think a certain way all the time
[1:48:27] just like if you always think negative
[1:48:29] see it's actually in brain physiology
[1:48:31] that your neurons and Things become
[1:48:33] certain Pathways because you think a
[1:48:35] certain way your brain rewires based on
[1:48:38] your thinking so if you always think
[1:48:40] negative it's actually physiologically
[1:48:42] your brain
[1:48:43] changes and that's why it's so easy to
[1:48:46] think that way but if you just change
[1:48:47] your thing you say hold on that's right
[1:48:49] am Hallelujah the Lord Jesus has saved
[1:48:52] me when I was a sinner he died for me
[1:48:55] amen when I gave his heart to me maybe a
[1:48:57] young child he's actually kept me I'm
[1:48:59] still
[1:49:00] here I'm still in spite of me I'm still
[1:49:03] here amen you know he's called me I
[1:49:06] believe he you know his word has called
[1:49:07] me to his side I think that should
[1:49:10] change he's made me an overcomer because
[1:49:11] the devil says well how do you know you
[1:49:13] going to overcome well what you were is
[1:49:15] not what you are amen amen what's
[1:49:19] happening you are climbing the mountain
[1:49:21] amen you're not down in the dungeon no
[1:49:23] more you're climbing the mountain right
[1:49:25] what are you doing you're overcoming
[1:49:26] amen praise God you're built to overcome
[1:49:29] amen yes sir amen so so we can stand in
[1:49:31] Victory I'm just going to as I said
[1:49:33] about to close but you know we can we
[1:49:36] are standing in Victory this morning we
[1:49:39] are standing in Victory you know the
[1:49:42] because the Lord Jesus has won the war
[1:49:44] he has conquered everything that can be
[1:49:46] conquered right he is the great
[1:49:48] Overcomer and then by the the Holy Ghost
[1:49:50] has come into your life and now you're
[1:49:52] overcoming see the devil loves to
[1:49:54] diminish our experiences that's why
[1:49:56] there's a testimony that that that that
[1:49:58] sister Brahman said that the Lord spoke
[1:50:00] and said this is more Supernatural Camp
[1:50:02] than it
[1:50:04] appears right because he say well we're
[1:50:06] just having camp and there's food and
[1:50:08] there's activities and there's Services
[1:50:10] you know it's just everyone's getting
[1:50:11] along it's more Supernatural than it
[1:50:13] appears and your life is more
[1:50:15] Supernatural than it appears amen
[1:50:19] Joseph's life was very Supernatural you
[1:50:22] think well he just had a couple of
[1:50:23] dreams that was the Supernatural part no
[1:50:25] that was the beginning because his whole
[1:50:27] life was now connected to those dreams
[1:50:30] and his whole life from those dreams to
[1:50:32] when he got to the throne and then his
[1:50:34] brothers came and everything was a
[1:50:35] manifestation of that dream now we are
[1:50:38] living in that time his Christ is
[1:50:42] calling his bride and then when maybe
[1:50:46] I'll
[1:50:48] um Christ is is calling his bride then
[1:50:51] we go to the wedding supper then Christ
[1:50:53] reveals himself to the
[1:50:55] Jews amen now let's just read a I'll
[1:50:58] just read one scripture and then then
[1:51:00] and then one quote then we'll have the
[1:51:01] musicians amen but you know therefore
[1:51:03] brethren we are dead is not to the flesh
[1:51:06] um to live after the flesh if if ye live
[1:51:09] after the flesh you shall die but if ye
[1:51:12] through the spirit do mortify the Deeds
[1:51:13] of the flesh you shall live for as many
[1:51:15] are as led by the spirit of God they are
[1:51:17] the sons of God hallelujah
[1:51:20] for ye you know that leadership can be
[1:51:22] so
[1:51:23] simple I feel to pray I feel to read I
[1:51:26] feel to come to church and and and and
[1:51:28] and even if your fleshes don't do it but
[1:51:29] there's something in you says I got to
[1:51:31] do it you know it can be simple everyday
[1:51:33] things
[1:51:35] amen for you have not received the
[1:51:37] spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:51:38] you've received the spirit of adoption
[1:51:40] where where we cry Abba Father amen if
[1:51:42] you received the Holy Ghost that's God
[1:51:45] you've received the spirit of adoption
[1:51:46] you know who your father is amen the
[1:51:48] spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:51:50] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:51:51] and if children then ears ears of God
[1:51:53] and Joint ears with Christ if so be that
[1:51:55] we suffer with him that we may also uh
[1:51:58] that we may be also glorified together
[1:52:02] so we join ears all that he did all that
[1:52:04] he fell ear to we've received amen we're
[1:52:06] joint ears amen didn't didn't earn it
[1:52:09] but we receive it praise God all all his
[1:52:12] victories all his Dominion we fall a too
[1:52:16] amen by his grace Hallelujah now
[1:52:25] amen okay I just i' read a couple of
[1:52:26] quotes I'll just read this one now
[1:52:29] because remember the battle isn't over
[1:52:31] we had a lot of Victories at camp but
[1:52:33] we're still in these bodies upon this
[1:52:35] earth oh yes okay so the battle I mean
[1:52:38] sure there's a lot of battles won but
[1:52:39] the war is still raging amen but the
[1:52:43] word says we're going to win the
[1:52:44] war so let's not just let's rejoice in
[1:52:48] Camp but let's keep pushing forward amen
[1:52:50] amen cuz we can't live just on past
[1:52:52] victories there's more victories to win
[1:52:54] God wants to reveal himself more to us
[1:52:56] he wants to open his word prove himself
[1:52:58] more in our lives amen so so we got to
[1:53:01] realize that we're still fighting amen
[1:53:04] that that you know for all of our
[1:53:07] god-given rights every Divine promise of
[1:53:09] God now he says as in restoration of the
[1:53:11] brid tree to restore means to bring back
[1:53:13] or to restore a claim can be enforced
[1:53:16] now to bring anything back to its
[1:53:17] rightful owner where it belongs
[1:53:18] therefore some way it went away from its
[1:53:21] rightful owner and can wander around
[1:53:22] anywhere but to restore is to bring it
[1:53:25] back to who really owns it or bring it
[1:53:28] back to its natural state where it was
[1:53:31] at the first time bring it back into its
[1:53:33] natural condition now to me that natural
[1:53:36] condition is a condition based on the
[1:53:38] word I mean not just a natural human
[1:53:40] condition but it's actual proper
[1:53:42] condition amen and in order to do this
[1:53:45] we have a right to enforce if there is a
[1:53:47] if there is a law to enforce its
[1:53:48] rightful condition of restoration to
[1:53:50] restore like if somebody stole my
[1:53:53] property and they're holding the
[1:53:54] property captive then you can take the
[1:53:56] law and go to this person and the law
[1:53:59] forces and forces this person to restore
[1:54:02] this property back to its natural owner
[1:54:04] into its liable First Estate amen
[1:54:08] remember our first estate was in God's
[1:54:10] thinking Made In His Image amen that's
[1:54:13] our first estate amen enforce then we
[1:54:16] have the privilege to enforce upon Satan
[1:54:18] this is you right now yeah amen you have
[1:54:21] this privilege isn't it good you have a
[1:54:23] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:54:25] claims that God give us amen for God has
[1:54:28] a law and his word is a law and God in
[1:54:32] this word made certain claims to the
[1:54:33] church therefore we have a right to
[1:54:35] force these claims upon Satan say give
[1:54:37] it back and he has to do it amen because
[1:54:41] we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit
[1:54:43] go right down on our knees and say it's
[1:54:45] thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it
[1:54:47] up that's because the holy spirit is
[1:54:49] there to make him do it the law of the
[1:54:51] land is to enforce it's by the land for
[1:54:53] the land but the law of the spirit of
[1:54:55] God is to force Satan to give up that
[1:54:58] which he has unrightfully def
[1:55:00] deceitfully taken from God Souls of men
[1:55:03] he took from God Souls of women children
[1:55:05] sickness of the body he placed upon
[1:55:07] people where God Made Them In His Image
[1:55:09] to be like him and the church has given
[1:55:11] the rightful legal rights by the Bible
[1:55:14] to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:55:17] upon Him amen see the devil says you
[1:55:20] have no right to claim that you said no
[1:55:21] no God gave me that right that's it God
[1:55:24] gave me the right you have no right
[1:55:25] Satan to tell me I have no rights
[1:55:27] because God gave you my rights and Satan
[1:55:30] you have a right to remain silent
[1:55:31] anything you do will be maybe used
[1:55:33] against you in evidence amen and we have
[1:55:36] the best forensics team in the world the
[1:55:38] holy ghost that doesn't leave any piece
[1:55:40] of evidence undone Hallelujah that now
[1:55:43] everything the devil does will be used
[1:55:45] against him in evidence amen hallelujah
[1:55:47] and remember the chief judge became our
[1:55:50] attorney amen amen so now the chief
[1:55:52] Supreme judge the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:54] became our attorney and he's fighting on
[1:55:56] our behalf amen hallelujah he is your
[1:55:59] Advocate amen he is he is your
[1:56:01] intercessor he's your mediator amen he's
[1:56:04] your lamb he's your high priest he's all
[1:56:06] in all amen so remember he's fighting
[1:56:08] your battle amen and if God be for us
[1:56:11] who can be against us amen see that's
[1:56:13] more than just a nice scripture that's a
[1:56:15] reality there's a lot of things against
[1:56:18] us I could just keep going on and on but
[1:56:19] you got to realize God was for me back
[1:56:21] there he's for me now and he shall be in
[1:56:23] the future Hallelujah so we have a right
[1:56:26] to take out let's take our god-given
[1:56:28] rights amen every Divine promise of God
[1:56:31] is yours right now amen the devil says
[1:56:35] it ain't you say no no no it is and you
[1:56:38] have a right to tell Satan where to go
[1:56:39] in the name of Jesus Christ we have
[1:56:41] nothing to fear we have nothing to fear
[1:56:44] amen because our God is not a God that
[1:56:47] has some wrestling match with other gods
[1:56:49] no he is the god of gods he's the Lord
[1:56:51] of lords he Supreme and he's defeated
[1:56:54] every enemy amen so let's go forward
[1:56:56] this coming year and let's walk in
