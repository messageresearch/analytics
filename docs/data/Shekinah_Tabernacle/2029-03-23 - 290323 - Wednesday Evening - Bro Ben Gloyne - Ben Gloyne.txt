scripture before we go into communion um and just a reminder there's a youth service um the staff on on Sunday afternoon amen so at 2 30 by the kid is going to lead us in worship and then um brother Jimmy and rather Dave are going to bring the word so looking forward to that amen if you want to come you're welcome doesn't matter what age so God bless you amen so Matthew 25 I'm going to read verses 34 to 40. if you could turn me down here a bit feels like I'm standing in a pipe but anyway um you know one thing you realize when you travel is uh sound problems and internet problems the universe also praise God when those things aren't around amen one day in glory right amen so Matthew 25 verses uh 34 to 40 here amen we're just going to read um just say Amen when you're there amen so 25 and 34 to 40. she's here then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father adhere it the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was and hungered and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer them saying Lord Windsor we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when so we the a stranger and took the end or naked and clothed thee or when saw we the sick or in prison and came under the and the King shall answer unto them very I say unto you and so much as ye have done unto one of the least my brethren ye have done it unto me amen and then we're just going to read one more actually let's just bow he's in a word of prayer amen tonight and you can have your seats afterwards Lord Jesus we thank you so much Lord we can come to your come to your table tonight Lord too Lord to remember your lord your death Lord your lord you gave your life you Lord you poured your life out Lord for our Redemption we want to thank you for that dear God as we come to partake Lord we lord I just pray father to be real sincerity in all of our hearts Lord and also our Thanksgiving Lord because we know Lord when we we couldn't come to where you were Lord up and glorious you came down became one of us to redeem us back to yourself Lord we couldn't save ourselves we need you to come Lord and you came o God and fulfilled Lord your purchase of our Salvation we love you so much we want to thank you for that dear God but Lord I pray we'll be very sincere because we know without you we can do nothing Lord so may you come Among Us Lord may fill your presence real close and Lord may this be a very intimate uh time of communion foot washing law between us and you granted dear God May forgive us all our sins cover us in your blood tonight Lord amen you receive will honor glory and praise and Lord may you also be with those who couldn't be here tonight as well be their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen hey man God bless you friends you may have your seats tonight so I want to talk about you know we know we understand that when we take the um take the communion and we know it's just symbols of of the Lord's body the bread and the and the wine being symbolic of his blood but we're making a public testimony we've become one with our sacrifice and and his life is is now flowing in our lives now but I want to I want to just kind of bring this to our attention a bit here where where this it's very interesting when you look at this where it says the least of my brethren many times we'll read these kind of scriptures and just kind of Let It Go by the wayside because um you know we think well it doesn't really bother us or pertain to us but it's amazing how you know if we're really a Believer we'll treat people differently and um and even when we read First Corinthians 11 it says that many are sick or sleep because they don't discern the Lord's body where they could not discern actually look beyond the Flesh of someone and see the Lord and that person and so now this word little ones or little here it's the same one as as we would probably be more familiar with with the scripture where the Lord says for example in Matthew 18 and 6 this is for whoso shall offend one of these my little ones which believeth in me it is better for him that a millstone be were hanged about his neck and we're drowned in the depths of the sea so this this word leased from the least of my brethren actually the root word of that word is actually this one little ones here and that and that little means actually it doesn't just mean the size or a stature but it means an age by a birth or being younger so we could actually change a bit and this is not changing the scripture but someone who's younger someone who's a child or a baby we could say they are immature they haven't become fully grown they're not fully adults yet they are growing to become that but they are not mature so we could say they are immature ones so someone who's a uh immature one you know and and I want to talk more spiritually as opposed to physically here but you know there's there's there's people in the body of Christ who could say they are little ones they are not mature you know they're they're still babies in the faith but that's okay as long as there's life as long as they're growing so you know it doesn't matter if you're a toddler in the Lord or you're some old age veteran spiritually speaking you know we're still the part of the same body of Christ but you see now it says as you've done unto the least of these my brethren so you can say as you've done unto the immature ones unto the ones who are not fully developed those who are still growing maybe they're still even in diapers spiritually and you know they've just been birthed they've just met the Lord you know those ones you could say they're still babies in the faith now this has nothing to do with your natural age people could be in their 80s and still be a baby spiritually that's okay as long as there's life God will get us to maturity we understand that and whatever God thinks of maturity is the thing that's important it's not what we think is mature because often man you know if we're honest what man thinks is right and what God thinks is right it's not even on the same scale you know so so but we know we've matured when these bodies change we understand that right we know we've made it when these bodies change okay but someone who's immature you know you think of someone naturally someone who goes from a child into adulthood you know going through going through puberty going through the teenage years you know they have mood swings they have emotional outbursts they get moody they do crazy things sometimes and you know Medical Science tells us that the brain their brain is not fully developed so they can't even make sound well thought out decisions yet Medical Science tells us that it's a it says that you should be at least 25 years old before you make a life-changing decision because your brain is still growing yeah yeah amen I think I'm there hopefully that could be debatable anyway but you see we can understand that naturally we say Well they're a teenager or they're a kitten you know and you can expect children to do crazy stuff and have wild outbursts and be moody and have mood swings and up and down and but you know because you understand that because they're children you know they're growing then it's very easy to have to be patient with them to be long-suffering with them because you know the way they're acting now is not how they're going to act in the future because they're growing they're going through a stage right they're not you know they're not going to be this way forever and but the thing is it's easy to look at people naturally and be patient with them because they're well they're teenagers they're hormones and things are going crazy they don't even know who they are really and you know they're changing and you know I remember being 18 it was a horrible time of life for me I didn't enjoy it was a dumb age I'm so glad I'm not 18 anymore if you are 18 and if you know the Lord that's great but you know it's like a it's it's like brother Isaac showed you know the youth going around the corn and the go-karts as long as you get around the corner hey have your cart's on fire at least you get around the corner you know you may be smooth maybe not but as long as you get around but there's a lot of things going on in your life I mean there's a lot of changes but we understand those things so it can be long-suffering with those kind of people but you know but what about now spiritually immature people you know because sometimes we can look at an adult and we can and and they may be still spiritual babies we get frustrated with them in a different way that we wouldn't get frustrated with a naturally a teenager if you think man they should be further along God should be you know but the thing is it says to the least of my immature ones you do it unto me so it's more we're going to look at each other I think a bit differently you know we should you know I was telling I was um I was you know I was talking to a young brother and and Chile and he was in a roundabout way saying he's unhappy with his pastor and I and I said well you know it's just like naturally a child when they're young they think their parents are superheroes they can do anything but then you come to an age when you begin to grow up you're going to realize actually your parents are adults I mean I mean they're human they make mistakes they're you know they're fallible when you're a child they were still adults they were still the same people but because you're because you're a baby you couldn't you couldn't you couldn't see them for what they really were but then you come to a stage we begin to see them for who they really are and it can be a shock when you realize dad's not a superhero anymore oh Mom's not a superhero anymore but then as you keep growing and you get become an adult then you appreciate your parents far more than you did when you thought they are superheroes right because you see the humanity but you appreciate all that they did for you I hope you kind of give me that kind of Grace right you know but it's the same thing as an adult growing and people growing in the Lord amen but but because perception has changed off my you know my voice packs up well that's fine amen okay so what about those now who are spiritually immature now now we know people when they first come to the Lord we have all kind of complexes we have all kind of pains and hurts and like our life is a chaos but God doesn't leave us in that chaos and the thing is though people who are spiritually immature will say it like this is that they allow those complexes pains and hurts to still rule their lives amen you know that you know that's how I feel about it you know that you know that someone who's mature can actually actually separate they they're not run by their feelings anymore they're not dictated to by their past anymore because the Lord has dealt with it and they know he's dealt with it and they now have a victory where they once had a defeat amen so they can they can look at life differently because God has grown them up they're not tossed to and fro anymore but there's still going to be spirit I I might be wrong because people think that the bride is going to be an utmost Perfection when the Rapture goes of maturity and humanly maybe not we're still going to have little ones this is just me you may disagree well the well the wheat's got to come to grain and you've got to come to maturity and but what is that maturity going to look like you know are we going to walk around and just have no problems no we're going to have problems still we're going to have complexes still maybe right we're still going to have pain and things in our minds we're going to be questioning and and wondering and why you know wrestle within wrestling with our personalities well this is not very Victorious but the thing it well that's what you might be thinking why are you preaching this to us well we've got to come to terms with actually our Victory is not based on how we feel our Victory is not based on our personality our Victory is not based on how sick or I mean or how well we are and body how much finances we have external things it's based on what the Lord has done for our souls amen that's where our Victory lays amen you take the two on the way to Emmaus they were in the greatest moment in history the death burial Resurrection Lord Jesus Christ brother Ram says that that the two on the way to a masses prophecy mondavis made clear by prophecy and those two prophecy speaking of a people that will fulfill that prophecy the Believers are brokenhearted downcast their whole world has fallen apart but they're part of the resurrection and brother I am saying is they are prophesying over future people so you know we're going to look at life a bit differently we're not going to have it all together when these bodies are changed necessarily we may be it may be the worst moments of our life that was the worst moment of their life their Messiah was dead the treasury committed suicide the preachers had to hold themselves up in a place somewhere their whole world had fallen apart but yet he walked with them revealing himself until they realized one he had resurrected but two he they were part of that Resurrection I mean so we can't we're we're not going to go on a Rapture because we're in some Nirvana state praise God so let's just throw that out of the way okay so maybe the spiritually immature will always be with us okay don't settle for being immature though grow let the Lord change our lives amen so it's those okay so so what about the ones who are complexed those are hurting the height behind bravado or insecure they're double-minded see people can have all those things and still be Believers they're still going to rapture right I'm sorry this is not a victory dance but we're going to look at what see we can't have a condescending look on people see Lucifer said I know I'm going to preach at one day I preach it in in Chile he said I'll Ascend above the stars of God so he says I'm going to ascend and look down on them the ones who are inherited will receive all things from God be part of him I'm going to send a look down on these people condescending look down upon them we can't have that kind of view in our lives none of his attributes belong to us yeah of the devil so we can't look at we can't look at someone say Well they're never going to get there they're always going to be a problem in things and we can't look at people like that as you've done to the least of my little ones you've done unto me how do we do we bear with them do we bear with them that have had a real experience in the Lord but yet in their Spirit they're still wrestling in terms of complexes pains in their past is still dealing with those they're still you know how do we how do we treat those kind of believers do we push them to the Wayside do we do we speak evil of them or do we or do we do we love them do we treat them with with probably more love than someone else you know it's the it's this it's the Young that actually dictate how fast we go into a rapture because because the Lord said in Deuteronomy that as a father does bear his son so I carried you to this place out of Egypt into the promised land so it's not the pace of the strong or the fast or the young that actually dictates the bride's journey into Glory that's it's the young it's maybe the feeble that think they can't make it because they're part of God they're going to make it it's those ones praise the Lord Hallelujah blessed us your weakened spirit porn spirit amen you know Jesus spoke about those things we're blessed you say well I'm feeling like I'm not blessed you're a blessed person if you're part of whom you're a very blessed person it means it's not the strong it's like when Christy and I took the family over to Canada you know we're going through customs in L.A and jet lagged and well that was me and didn't know where I was and you know but it wasn't me and Christine's Pace getting from one gate to another that dictated us getting there it was the the children we couldn't leave them behind you can't leave your family behind you've got to carry them all that's the same thing with God you know we may feel like we're going slow but God will carry us through now I say all this but uh but I'm not don't get me wrong and say I'm not telling you just live in a defeated State and think that this is just how you're going to be no we're going from Victory to Victory right but you know we shouldn't let those things rule Our Lives you know how we treat people does not give us license to treat them the same way Jesus it's amazing I was just looking at the statement where where the Lord said in Matthew 7 and 12 therefore all things whatsoever you would that ye would that men should do to you can you put this uh maybe not yeah can we put it up Matthew 7 and 12. this is this to me what do we got is this a honey drink or something brother Pedro and I lived on this in Chile thank you all right Matthew 7 and 12. 7 and 12. yeah no not that one that's not our scripture we've got a seven and a top it's coming it's all right pause for effect here we go therefore all things whatever you do that men that you would that men would do should do to you do you even so to them so whatever you do to others do as a unto yourself for this is the law and the prophets so you mean the whole Old Testament is encapsulated in this one phrase absolutely so we should treat others how we want to be treated that's basically what Jesus is saying they're saying the whole Old Testament is encapsulated in that one phrase so if I want to be treated well I'm going to treat others well yeah right not based on how they treat me now I'm going to do unto others as I would have them do unto me it says in First Peter 3 and 9 not rendering evil for evil or rallying for railing but contrast blessing knowing that ye are there unto called that ye should inherit a blessing so we shouldn't render evil for evil amen we shouldn't be railing for railing basically we're not reactionary the believer the world is reactionary but the believer should not be reactionary what does reactionary mean well you react based on how someone treats you first so if they're nice to me I'll react and be nice to them if they're mean to me I'll react and be mean to them we're not meant to be those kind of soundboards amen if someone loves you you love them if they hate you you love them if they're mean to you you love them if they speak you love you you love them right if if they treat you with absolute absolute disrespect you Retreat them with respect you treat them with love amen because knowing that ye are there unto called that you shouldn't hear it a blessing amen that's why you should contrast not railing for railing or evil for evil but contrast blessing knowing that you there aren't too cold that you shouldn't hear a blessing you know it's amazing how some people think that the great white Throne judgment or the Judgment seat of Christ works we know the Judgment seat of Christ we shall all stand before it it's for rewards right there's a great way I thought judgment the bride doesn't go there right but there's a judgment seat of Christ but it's amazing how some people think um you know think those judgments work like for example people think that they're going to stand before God one day and God's going to say what did you do with me and they'll say well this this hypocrite did this in church and this pastor to this church and this Deacon did this and this Scandal happened here and that's why I didn't serve you and then the Lord says well enter into the joys of the Lord you know that was prepared for you before the foundation of the world that's how some people think it's going to work because these people Hypocrites did all these evil things therefore they didn't that they didn't become Christians so therefore God's going to let them in it's not going to work that way you know because we no one is going to enter into heaven or get any reward for their walk with Lord because they treated somebody bad because that person did it first you're not going to get any blessing for that right we're all going to stand before because it says in Romans 14 and 10 why does thou judge thy brother or why does thou sit at naught thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ now so why do you sit at naught by brothers that means to make of no account to despise utterly well how do you see them but not like that you run them down running down brother so-and-so sister so-and-so she's always doing this saying that the other day X Y and Z blah blah blah that's setting them at naught we yo why why do because we're all gonna have to give an account for those things see that's what people but people think that they have license they have license and we shouldn't say well I'm just immature therefore I can do what I want people going to be with me we shouldn't have that in our minds you know so because the question will be why you know why did you because people because the questions will be asked every man woman and child what did you do with my word when it came your way and in reality the question is what did you do with me what did you do with me because sometimes it sounds very impersonal when you say what did you do with God's word this is God in print form so the question will be that day what did you do with me did you allow me to rule your life in the good times and the bad in the in the very uncomfortable stressful times the the times where people were mean to you and evil and stabbed you in the back and spoke evil of you and you know it was harsh and they did things that made no sense what did you do with me in those times did you allow me to rule your life did you allow me to be king and take control of that situation or did you allow your carnal nature to push me aside that it can live and have its way because I tell you what to the carnal man it can be satisfying to get one in there right but we're not called to be carnal we're called to be spiritual we're called to be made in the image of God amen so that's why the question will be you know what did you do with me in those times the Lord speaking here I feel Amy because this is in First Corinthians three and three for for a year yet carnal four hours is there among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and Walker's men we're not called to walk as men are walking in a certain direction the redeemed walk in another Direction amen and the redeem walk with the word of God so we shouldn't be carnal to be there shouldn't be any envious rifle problems amen sure they can be misunderstandings sure there can be difference of opinion because we're all human right if we sat down and said now what color should the walls be painted or what color should the carpet be or the chairs or the decor we would have every how many people are here everyone would have a different idea and that's fine we're all different right but we shouldn't let those things be a wedge we should appreciate differences like I'm proud to say we're like the United Nations here I'm very happy about that I'm glad we're not just a bunch of white people praise God I'm glad we're a multicultural you know from all parts of the world God can do a super there's a supernatural Gathering different cultures age groups backgrounds whatever whatever we're all one in Christ that's a powerful thing the United Nations can't do what God does here because they all have their own agenda we have one agenda that Jesus Christ will be made on that's incredible they can't even agree on I don't know what oh man I'd be so frustrated sitting in their meetings you know however that works oh boy we have on vetoes and walks out and Stomps and blah and you know man good luck trying to remodel that place with the committee anyway yeah no let's leave that one alone but praise God we're better things than that amen so you know see and and that's why I put this I put this um the quote on the brothers and sisters here I just want to read it here so to me it's powerful now don't you listen to one Falcon the devil has got to say see if the devil shows you some or tells you something evil about one of the members of the body of Christ don't you believe it for as soon as you believe it you my your experience you might your own experience it's not the person being mad it Mars you and if you see one of the members of the body of Christ doing something evil don't tell nobody else but go to that member and with love and see if you can bring them back to Christ again and if you can't do that then tell one person or let them go with you do it the way the scripture says but don't if somebody says sister so-and-so brother son so don't believe one word of it you just leave it go because remember is the devil trying to tear you to pieces now just look for him to come in because he'll do it now you let the good man of the house Faith stand right there and don't don't you receive one thing these people have all set in Heavenly places with you Fellowship together pardon me around the blessings of God taking communion at the table and the Holy Spirit has witnessed that they are the children of God just let just let that real sweet kind-hearted forgiving loving and if the other person talks evil against you you talk sweet against them amen watch how sweeter comes to you then see that's right just always return good for evil love for hate amen that's how we should be there amen because remember and so much you've done to one of these my immature ones you've done unto me right so we shouldn't tear someone down are you all on the same page well don't you know what they did to me Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they do he could have called for 12 reasons of annuals wiped out level the whole of obviously but because of love he went there and his last one of his last words was forgive them they don't know what they do amen we should be the same way because we had to be like Jesus amen praise the Lord but I hope you don't get me wrong there's overcoming power for all complexes paints hurt your past everything God can take care of it all okay but sometimes people have been birthed into the kingdom but they those things still rule them but do we bear with them do we love them amen like a child becoming an adult going through teenage years amen so we shouldn't we shouldn't let those things trouble us we should love you know there's the world is starving for love and I believe we have Divine love and we should protect Divine love we should nurture it we should treasure what we have in the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now if the Lord can love like that remember he loves the unlovable he Bears remember he was long-suffering with you and I am he was very long suffering he let us go a long time but he knew when he'd find us amen so if so so if he was long-suffering with us can't we be long-suffering with someone else well they should know better we all should have known better in church we all should know better right not one of us is a special case that we had it all together the Bible says we were all like sheep going astray that's right oh not some all do I put my I'm part of the all right amen I went astray but he came and got me back Hallelujah and then he gave his life that we his life would come into us he washes of our sins make us new creatures in Christ amen that's why to me it's such a precious thing we can come and say Lord I wanna I wanna be clean Lord forgive me if I've done wrong forgive me if my tongue is rattle off things against people I've hurt hurt part of you one of your little ones Lord Jesus forgive me if I haven't acted as I should have acted in life and I got to carnal sometimes I lost my vision and been mean and you know they say Lord I want to rededicate my life tonight Hallelujah that when I come to the communion table and I'm showing this world remember there's a public testimony that his body was broken for you and you become one with the lamb just like in the first you could say communion the first Exodus the lamb was shed for the house in Israel they had to eat that lamb and they became and then the blood of course was on the door and lentil right but they became one with their sacrifice and by the power of the Lamb they left Egypt and they went into the Promised Land and so one time you saw the lamb and the family but then after that was all done you just saw the family because the lamb was now made one with the family because they ate their very sacrifice they became one with him and that we don't physically eat the Lord Jesus Christ but by accepting his sacrifice his blood amen giving your life completely then what his life comes into you amen and then now where is where is he he's in you Hallelujah so the life of God and you are not separate anymore the life of Jesus Christ steps into you and you're one praise God so I'm so thankful for that amen so let's stand shall we as we just read the communion scripture from first um First Corinthians 11. and then we're going to pray for the um pray for the bread and the wine and then we'll have a time of prayer just whenever you feel to come up that you can you can come up and take the communion and if you're a Christian you're really giving your life for the Lord Jesus Christ amen says in First Corinthians 11 and 20. says when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for an aiding everyone take it before other his own supper and one is hungry another is drunken what have you not houses to eat and drinking or despise either Church of God and shame them that have not or what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night when which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this during remembrance of me after the same man also took the cup which he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood thirsty years after as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily each of them drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many a weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastens of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home and that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come I mean so we're just going to pray brother could be and by the Ed you're not come forward we're going to pray for the bread and the wine as I say let's let's examine ourselves and pray tonight before we come forward you know
