[29:56] read a scripture then will'll let you be
[29:58] seated go to Luke chapter
[30:06] 4 I found it kind of interesting I've
[30:08] been studying all through the day trying
[30:11] to find the mind of the Lord and and I
[30:14] put the scripture down Luke chapter
[30:16] 4 and then when I put it down and then
[30:20] afterwards I heard the the brother
[30:22] singing the
[30:24] song Jesus Set Me Free when I heard the
[30:28] Jubilee I walked free so there was kind
[30:31] of a a little of a confirmation in my
[30:34] heart when I had wrote the scripture
[30:36] down that that's kind of the way the
[30:38] Lord want me to go let's go to Luke chap
[30:41] 4:
[30:46] 18 he said the spirit of the Lord is
[30:48] upon me because he has anointed me to
[30:52] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[30:55] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[30:58] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[31:01] to recover the sight of the blind to set
[31:04] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[31:07] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[31:11] which actually is the Year of Jubilee
[31:13] amen amen praise the Lord you may be
[31:16] seated
[31:23] tonight my name is burley Williams uh
[31:26] I'm a pastor a fellowship in a little
[31:30] town called peler South Carolina I'm
[31:34] from the south in the United States and
[31:37] uh I've been to New Zealand several
[31:39] times but this is my first time uh being
[31:42] up on this side amen amen amen so uh we
[31:45] just I was telling the other churches I
[31:47] bring you greetings from my church but I
[31:50] don't bring greetings from
[31:52] America cuz there's nothing to greet you
[31:54] from there the only thing God is
[31:56] concerned in America is his bride that
[31:59] is a cursed country it it really is and
[32:03] and I can say that you know sometimes
[32:05] when ministers come from overseas and
[32:06] say things about America American get
[32:10] mad but I'm from America so I can say
[32:13] whatever I want to say about
[32:15] it and uh when they rejected the gospel
[32:18] and uh like the prophet of God said they
[32:20] can raise up all of the uh George
[32:23] Washington's and Ben Franklin it won't
[32:25] do no good she's doomed and uh if
[32:28] Hillary Clinton get the presidency we're
[32:31] in trouble if Donald Trump get it we
[32:33] just in more trouble so either way we
[32:36] it's it's messed up so as a country
[32:39] she's finished so I'm so thankful to
[32:42] know that my nationality might be an
[32:44] American but I'm a
[32:46] Christian so uh I'm so thankful that I'm
[32:49] not even a l of
[32:51] sin we're in the bride age can we say am
[32:54] man some people get offended with that
[32:56] terminology but it's actually is the
[32:58] truth when you are born again you're not
[33:00] all to sin you have been ushered into
[33:03] the bride age and I believe that's what
[33:05] the message come to do to bring us into
[33:08] the bride age amen and so that we could
[33:10] see who we are in this day and this time
[33:13] praise the Lord so we just uh bring you
[33:16] greetings from the church and we just a
[33:18] group of people just trusting in the
[33:20] Lord and waiting on the coming of the
[33:22] Lord and the Lord is doing a lot of
[33:24] wonderful things and we're so thankful
[33:26] for that amen I want to just
[33:32] uh tonight uh I just want to minister on
[33:35] a subject may seem a little strange but
[33:39] I don't think it's strange and uh I
[33:41] actually never preached on this subject
[33:44] before but it just feel like the Lord
[33:46] just really pressing my heart and I just
[33:49] uh begin to look up some scriptures and
[33:51] things and I trust that it'll be a
[33:53] blessing for you I want to minister on
[33:55] the power of forgiveness
[33:59] the power of forgiveness amen so uh I
[34:04] want to read a quote and I'm pretty sure
[34:07] that all of you is familiar with this
[34:09] quote it was about a lady that wanted to
[34:12] get some healing and she kept coming to
[34:14] brother Brandon to get prayed for and
[34:16] get some healing and so forth and she
[34:19] could never get Deliverance until he
[34:21] finally she kept coming back and forth
[34:23] to brother brandham then one day brother
[34:25] brandham was sitting in his office his
[34:27] wife told told him it's that lady again
[34:29] and then at that time when she had came
[34:32] the angel of the Lord had came in the
[34:34] room with brother Brandon and then he
[34:36] said now send her in and then when she
[34:38] went in that room that's when the
[34:40] prophet of God began to tell her things
[34:42] about her life and I'm sure you familiar
[34:45] with the story but I would like to read
[34:47] that story how long do you preach
[34:49] brother how long I
[34:52] got okay so uh sometimes I can be a
[34:56] little rather long winded
[34:58] is that song leader are you a
[35:01] preacher you're an evangelist I can
[35:05] tell soon as I seen him saying I said
[35:07] they got to be a preacher and he got to
[35:09] be an
[35:10] evangelist amen praise the Lord but
[35:14] that's all
[35:16] good I'm going to read this quote and I
[35:20] like to say something
[35:22] uh I've been serving the lord 27 years
[35:26] and uh I come straight to the message
[35:27] out of from the streets I was a thug and
[35:31] but this is all I ever know is the
[35:33] message but you know in my 27 years and
[35:37] uh I've been pastoring 12 years I used
[35:40] to be a full-time evangelist for eight
[35:42] years and uh but through the 27 years
[35:45] I've seen a lot of things I've seen a
[35:48] lot of people come I've seen a lot of
[35:50] people go but you know what I found that
[35:53] a lot of people that walk away from the
[35:56] Lord and walk away from the church and
[35:58] so forth like that I begin to realize a
[36:01] lot of them are not bad
[36:03] people and then when you see them and
[36:05] you run across them in the streets or
[36:08] something and you begin to talk to them
[36:11] and I find and I begin to ask him what
[36:13] happened and when they begin to express
[36:15] some things I find what what hurts a lot
[36:18] of people is things that they hold in
[36:21] their hearts through years and they
[36:24] won't let it go and they won't let
[36:27] proper healing take place and then it
[36:29] surface back up and I find that to be
[36:32] true and many people struggle with
[36:35] letting things go and many people
[36:37] struggle with
[36:38] forgiveness and one thing I learned
[36:40] about when a person don't forgive they
[36:43] could go times and season in their life
[36:45] happy and then for you know they sad
[36:47] again happy and then they sad again
[36:50] because they won't let those things go
[36:52] but there is a power in
[36:54] forgiveness and I believe that with all
[36:56] of my heart
[36:58] you know uh let me just read this quote
[37:01] for you he said when I took her in the
[37:03] room I said all right come on up when
[37:07] people come we just stop everything I
[37:10] got her in the room I sat down and just
[37:13] start talking to her about genealogies
[37:16] and about the beginning the origin of
[37:18] time and everything and watching her it
[37:22] was that same morning God is always
[37:25] there at the crucial moment you know and
[37:27] after a while I looked out there come a
[37:30] vision moving up I seen an automobile
[37:33] going swiftly and this is the prophet of
[37:35] God talking to this woman but look how
[37:37] he started off talking to her about
[37:39] genealogist in beginning of time just
[37:41] talking about the word cuz when you talk
[37:44] about the word that brings God presence
[37:46] on the
[37:47] scene he said I said your
[37:50] condition has something to do with an
[37:53] automobile she said no I never was in a
[37:56] wreck
[37:58] I I I just sit humble said I see you in
[38:01] a car you almost got hit by a
[38:04] train she jumped she said oh I said yes
[38:10] and you're not with your husband you're
[38:12] with another man your husband is
[38:14] overseas and War at that time went ahead
[38:17] and begin to bring it on down I said the
[38:19] things that you done the immoral things
[38:23] you told him about some of it but you
[38:26] didn't tell him about all of it so she
[38:29] feel that she certain things to her
[38:32] husband that she was okay but she had to
[38:34] tell it
[38:35] all can we say praise the Lord how many
[38:38] of you believe that the Lord sent us a
[38:40] messages in this day called total
[38:41] Deliverance not halfway Deliverance but
[38:45] total deliverance and that's what I
[38:48] believe and then he says
[38:50] here and she started screaming holding
[38:53] her face like that I said you're going
[38:56] to have an operation not long ago to for
[39:00] your tonsils and you was afraid to take
[39:02] the anesthetic afraid you could tell
[39:05] that underneath she just screamed and
[39:08] fell on the floor she said that's the
[39:11] truth she said I asked God to forgive me
[39:15] I said you never sinned against God you
[39:17] sinned against your husband and vows I
[39:21] said you go back and make that right
[39:23] then come and I want you to
[39:26] notice he he said you go back and make
[39:28] that right and then when you come he
[39:31] said I can control that demon
[39:36] then that's pretty
[39:38] powerful he said you go to make that
[39:40] right come back to me he said I can
[39:44] control that
[39:45] demon you see what the power of
[39:48] forgiveness and making things right it
[39:51] scripts demons it giv them nothing to
[39:54] hold on to when things is confessed and
[39:57] made right and I said by the way your
[40:01] husband I described how he looked never
[40:04] seen him in my life I said he has got
[40:07] some things to confess to you I said now
[40:10] if you don't believe it call him on the
[40:12] phone and tell him to meet you she went
[40:16] in called him on the phone they met on
[40:19] the road and here they come back tears
[40:23] running down their cheeks he said they
[40:26] forgave one another
[40:28] the demon left her and she was
[40:31] free just because of them forgiving one
[40:34] another it caused that demon to leave
[40:36] and it set them not only her free it set
[40:39] both of them free he said now I might
[40:43] have screened and hollered over that
[40:44] demon and cast everything else and they
[40:48] had never left till that was corrected
[40:50] see you got to find the cause before you
[40:54] can find the Cur amen and I'm believe
[40:57] that we're in the age of release the
[41:00] scripture that we read in here Jesus
[41:02] said I he said I come to preach
[41:06] Deliverance to the captives and the
[41:07] recovering of the sight to the blind to
[41:10] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[41:12] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[41:15] and I believe brothers and sisters
[41:17] another reason why this is so meaningful
[41:19] to me I was dealing with a situation
[41:22] since I've been up here something that I
[41:24] didn't come to expect to deal with but I
[41:27] got into I got in between a
[41:29] quarrel between two
[41:32] Brethren and then I seen the way that it
[41:34] was going and when you see things like
[41:36] that as a minister we supposed to be not
[41:39] only ministers as Christian we supposed
[41:41] to be
[41:42] peacemakers can we say Amen you know
[41:45] sometimes uh we uh like to run from that
[41:47] scripture when you know a brother got a
[41:49] alt against a brother a brother somebody
[41:51] got an AR against you we just a it don't
[41:53] matter just leave it alone forget it but
[41:56] that still don't change the spirit
[41:57] scripture the scripture means exactly
[41:59] what it means so sometimes we have to
[42:02] dig into things that we don't want to
[42:03] dig in and work with things that we
[42:05] don't want to work with but it's all
[42:07] about being set free can we say praise
[42:10] the Lord I don't expect this to be a
[42:12] jumping shout and screaming service but
[42:15] I aim to preach the truth amen because
[42:18] somebody be honest with you brothers and
[42:19] sisters I was telling you Pastor uh I'm
[42:22] Prett I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty bold
[42:24] when it comes to the gospel because I
[42:26] know it's true
[42:28] amen and I and and I know we're living
[42:30] in a time God want our hearts to be free
[42:33] he want our minds to be free he want our
[42:35] conscience to be free he don't want
[42:37] nothing hold in our heart that's going
[42:38] to hinder our relationship with him God
[42:40] don't want that he want us to be set
[42:43] free and that's what Jesus did he came
[42:45] and set those that was bruised and
[42:47] wounded they was bruised through uh
[42:49] complexes in their lives they was
[42:51] religiously religiously bruised through
[42:53] the Pharisees Sadducees Jesus was
[42:56] dealing with a of bruised people that's
[42:59] what he was dealing with but he come to
[43:00] set them free and I believe that's what
[43:03] the message of the hour that's reason
[43:05] why the prophet of God himself went
[43:08] through pain Agony suffering
[43:11] disappointments God built him to be able
[43:14] to deliver the message that he able to
[43:16] deliver because he was able to put
[43:18] himself there cuz he been through it
[43:20] amen losing his wife losing his daughter
[43:23] all those things have to happen then God
[43:26] allowed him to go through that just so
[43:28] he can deliver messages for us so that
[43:30] we can be set free because every Prophet
[43:33] have to be a partaker of his own
[43:35] ministry that's why you find in the
[43:37] scripture God would cause a prophet to
[43:39] lay on his side one year then to get in
[43:42] the flip and lay on the other side
[43:44] another year I'm so glad God ain't ask
[43:46] none of us to do that but that is not uh
[43:50] a a fiction that was not a a madeup
[43:52] story that actually happened but it
[43:55] wasn't nothing that he did
[43:58] it was what the children of Israel was
[43:59] doing but he had to suffer through it
[44:02] through his ministry so that God could
[44:04] show an example for him amen so that is
[44:08] the exact reason why a lot of time
[44:11] pastors go through things sometimes it's
[44:13] not nothing that we done but God allow a
[44:16] pastor to go through something and let
[44:18] him go through it and then he'll build a
[44:20] message out of it then he preach it and
[44:23] it'll be something that somebody else
[44:24] has gone through that's the way God
[44:27] works sometime God allow you to go
[44:30] through something just so you'll be able
[44:32] to you're going to run into somebody
[44:33] someday and you'll be talking to them
[44:36] you'll say man I've been through that
[44:38] now you would be able to witness to them
[44:41] because you experienced it so a lot of
[44:43] things we go through in life is actually
[44:46] not for you sometimes it's God to do
[44:48] that through you so that you would be
[44:50] able to help somebody else and that's
[44:52] just the way that it is amen so every
[44:56] Minister got to be partaker of his own
[44:58] sermons and every congregation got to be
[45:00] partaker of the sermons that they hear
[45:03] so it works all together but it works
[45:05] for the good can we say praise the Lord
[45:09] now if you will I want to read something
[45:11] go to Job chapter
[45:17] 42 I'm sure we're all familiar with the
[45:19] story of
[45:24] Job the things that job
[45:28] went
[45:28] through it was nothing that job
[45:32] done job went through a trial cuz he was
[45:35] perfect amen the Bible said God told the
[45:38] enemy you consider my servant job he's a
[45:42] perfect man amen he was bragging on job
[45:45] so job was going through something he
[45:48] had no reason why had no idea what was
[45:51] going on but God permitted that battle
[45:53] to take place and one thing we got to
[45:56] realize and that give us as Believers
[45:57] give us hope that the devil can't do
[46:00] nothing to you without God's permission
[46:03] amen and I'm thankful for that amen and
[46:06] know Satan's desire was to get job to
[46:08] curse God but God knew Job wasn't going
[46:10] to curse him God had confidence in his
[46:14] servant and I like what the prophet of
[46:15] God he said can God feel the same way
[46:17] about you and I say he do amen he feel
[46:21] the same way about his bride that's why
[46:23] God Amen that's why we understand the
[46:26] lid has been been torn off of hell every
[46:29] demon every force that Satan has has
[46:32] been released in this age that's why God
[46:35] Satan done emptied hell and God emptied
[46:38] Heaven that's why the breaking of the
[46:40] seal the fullness of the word has come
[46:42] to the Bride of Jesus Christ where we
[46:45] could come back any Spirit any demon God
[46:48] has given us the material amen so those
[46:51] things are so amen so but now job the
[46:55] things that that he was going through
[46:57] not understanding what was going on but
[47:00] God was bragging on his servant have
[47:02] y'all ever thought about
[47:03] this when the Angels was deceived in
[47:07] heaven they was deceived in a perfect
[47:11] place you ever thought about that heaven
[47:14] was perfect but the devil was able to
[47:17] deceive them in a perfect place then
[47:21] they was kicked out of heaven now Eve
[47:24] when Adam and Eve was in the garden they
[47:26] was in a perfect place and the devil was
[47:29] able to come to deceive Eevee in a
[47:32] perfect place can we say praise the Lord
[47:36] but now God Eve fell in a perfect place
[47:39] the Angels fell in a perfect place now
[47:41] God put you and me in the worst place in
[47:44] the worst age and said you won't
[47:47] fail can me say amen and I'm thankful
[47:50] for that that's the confidence God has
[47:53] in his bride the prophet of God said the
[47:55] bride won't fall am amen sometimes we
[47:57] might look at conditions and things in
[47:58] our life and feel falling but you're
[48:01] looking in the wrong mirror that's why
[48:03] we supposed to look towards Calvary cuz
[48:05] everything that we have need for Christ
[48:07] died on Calvary for you and me and I'm
[48:10] so thankful for that amen so job in the
[48:14] scriptures here if there's a man that
[48:18] could have allowed bitterness to come
[48:21] into his heart it was job and Joseph the
[48:25] things that happened to them the things
[48:26] that people done to them they could have
[48:28] easily got bitterness in their heart
[48:30] that's right and now and and I can
[48:32] guarantee you they had Temptations or
[48:34] wanting to hate because of what they was
[48:36] going through but Joseph out of all the
[48:40] things that he went through God had to
[48:42] train him till he got to a place he
[48:45] realized God has done this for me to me
[48:48] for a purpose everything Joseph went
[48:51] through was for his brothers amen so to
[48:54] preserve them amen God knew that Joseph
[48:57] didn't know it and I like what Joseph
[48:59] said you done it for evil but God done
[49:02] it for good if there ever was a good
[49:04] quote to re to live by is De one you may
[49:07] done it for the evil but God done it for
[49:09] the good and they go and show you that
[49:12] Joseph had leared something he had now
[49:15] came into all power he could have very
[49:18] easily told them Egyptian to kill his
[49:20] Brethren amen just one word they could
[49:23] have done it but Joseph had power but he
[49:26] didn't use it for the wrong thing see
[49:28] sometimes people think power is what you
[49:30] can do power is also something that you
[49:33] can do and you got the power not to do
[49:35] it you got the character not to do it
[49:39] that is also power can we say praise the
[49:41] Lord now job all the things that job
[49:45] went through job cursed everything but
[49:48] God Amen can we say Amen but I want you
[49:51] to watch the scripture in job 42 verse
[49:55] 7
[49:58] and let me say this before I read this
[50:01] God do
[50:02] things sometime we just don't understand
[50:05] it but he has the purpose you know
[50:07] Abraham was in Fault when he took his
[50:10] family down to Egypt yeah right Abraham
[50:13] was in fault he told Sarah what to say
[50:16] that was his fault by Abraham fault God
[50:20] was F to curse this man Kingdom going to
[50:22] curse this King right but look what God
[50:25] turn around and tell him
[50:27] go get Abraham and pray for
[50:30] you that King could have
[50:33] said this man told me that was his
[50:35] sister and you want him to pray for me
[50:37] he the one that was
[50:39] wrong but God he do whatever he wants to
[50:43] do when he wants to do it he don't think
[50:46] like us but he want us to think like him
[50:49] that's why he want us to have the mind
[50:51] of Christ can we say praise the Lord and
[50:54] let me just uh just I just want to
[50:57] lay a little Foundation here I know I'm
[50:59] I trust we getting somewhere but just
[51:01] kind of I know you listen to me see
[51:03] where I'm going and I'm also filling
[51:05] your spirit to see where you're going
[51:07] cuz you never you don't know me and I
[51:09] don't know you but we all know Jesus
[51:12] Christ you got to remember something
[51:14] brothers and sisters we see the same Sun
[51:17] but we don't see the same
[51:19] clouds so we got differences in life but
[51:22] we got to look at the same son praise
[51:24] the Lord now watch this in job
[51:28] 42 and it was so verse
[51:31] 7 and it was so that after the Lord had
[51:34] spoken the words unto job the Lord said
[51:37] unto elast the timite my wrath is
[51:40] kindled against thee and against thy two
[51:43] friends for you have not spoken of me
[51:46] the thing that is right as my servant
[51:49] job which we know there was false
[51:50] accusing job as a secret sinner job said
[51:54] death in the Bible said therefore take
[51:56] unto you you seven blocks and seven Rams
[51:59] and go to my servant job and offer for
[52:02] yourself a burnt offering and my servant
[52:05] job shall pray for you now look how they
[52:07] don't call Job secret centner and all
[52:09] these things now God said now he got to
[52:12] pray for you see God is turning the
[52:15] whole story around right now amen after
[52:18] all of the accusation he said for him
[52:22] will I'll accept least I deal with you
[52:25] after your folly and that you have not
[52:27] spoken of me the things which is right
[52:30] like my servant job now here's the
[52:34] test they done a lot of things to job
[52:37] they called job a lot of things now God
[52:40] is not only going to Jud touch them but
[52:43] he's still going to test job job last
[52:46] test that he went through are all of the
[52:49] things that happened his last test was
[52:53] able to
[52:55] forgive that was his last test to
[52:58] forgive out of all these things people
[53:01] said about you and done now are you
[53:03] willing to forgive cuz watch the
[53:06] scripture now verse n so elphas the
[53:10] Tonite and badad the shuhite and zofar
[53:13] the zamite went did according to did as
[53:19] the Lord commanded them the Lord also
[53:22] accepted job now watch what it's saying
[53:25] and the Lord also so accepted job now
[53:28] watch the other scripture and the Lord
[53:31] turned the Captivity of job when he
[53:35] prayed for his friends also the lord
[53:38] gave job twice as much as he had before
[53:41] what turn everything in that trial that
[53:45] joob was going through was his ability
[53:47] to pray for them and forgive them for
[53:50] what they done to him and when job
[53:53] prayed look what the scripture said the
[53:55] Lord turned
[53:57] the Captivity of job friend that's
[54:00] powerful That's The Power of forgiveness
[54:02] it changes things it brings peace not
[54:05] only between you and God it brings peace
[54:08] between you and yourself and the one
[54:10] that probably even may it offended you
[54:12] praise the Lord I really like that
[54:14] scripture he turned the Captivity of job
[54:19] notice when he prayed for his friends so
[54:22] that was not only letting job free it
[54:24] was also letting them free and that's
[54:26] the power of forgiveness amen can we say
[54:30] praise the
[54:30] Lord let's go a little further
[54:33] here turn with me to Isaiah chapter
[54:51] 1 I just just
[54:54] uh see what verse I want here
[54:58] let's go down to verse
[55:04] five and I'll say some things after this
[55:07] scripture I use this scripture right
[55:10] here because I find myself in
[55:13] pastoring you know sometimes you got to
[55:14] be patient you got to be very
[55:17] patient sometimes people can be offended
[55:19] about something somebody say you need to
[55:22] go correct that brother you need to
[55:24] correct them you need to take care of
[55:25] that it's not necess you can't move
[55:27] quick you have to wait you have to have
[55:30] patience because one thing I know is
[55:34] somebody is bruised up all tore up
[55:37] inside and they got complexes within
[55:39] thems themselves you you actually can't
[55:42] correct them you can try but it won't do
[55:45] no good they won't receive it so some
[55:48] healing they have to take place to they
[55:50] can come to a place where they could
[55:52] receive correction because the scripture
[55:54] makes it very plain here verse five he
[55:57] said why should you be stricken anymore
[55:59] you will Revolt more and more the whole
[56:02] head is sick and the whole heart faint
[56:04] other words it's saying why rebuke you
[56:07] why I correct you anymore it ain't going
[56:09] to do no good you're just going to get
[56:10] more mad you going to go get mad more
[56:12] matter I talked to a young guy one time
[56:15] and he uh I this it was he moved away I
[56:18] waited about nine months and I finally
[56:20] called him and I talked to him I said I
[56:21] want to share some things with you he
[56:23] was no longer in my church and then I
[56:25] was talking to him and so forth sharing
[56:27] some things with him he said why you
[56:28] telling me this now I said cuz then you
[56:31] want to listen to me and your head was
[56:33] sick I said you wouldn't have listening
[56:35] to me I said but now you don't matured a
[56:37] little bit now you would listen I think
[56:40] that those are some Godly good
[56:41] principles to use and I learned these
[56:44] things actually from Brother brandham
[56:46] how did he handled things because the
[56:48] Bible said that an angry man is hard to
[56:50] win if they're offended you just can't
[56:52] win them so the main thing is work with
[56:54] the offense can we say praise the Lord
[56:58] now let's go a little further verse six
[57:01] it said from the soil of the foot even
[57:04] into the head there is no soundness in
[57:06] it but wounds and bruises and petrifying
[57:08] sores that has not been closed neither
[57:11] bound up neither MiFi with ointment now
[57:15] the key thing to this scripture here it
[57:17] said wounds and bruises that has never
[57:20] been closed neither bound up or
[57:23] mollified that goes back to what I said
[57:25] in the beginning many people got wounds
[57:27] and bruises in their life that are not
[57:29] closed they not have been dealt with
[57:32] correctly that's why they keep
[57:34] resurfacing can we say amen that's what
[57:37] Jesus said he come to do set them that
[57:39] have been bruised set them at liid set
[57:41] the capus free that's what he came to do
[57:45] because God want us to have complete
[57:46] healing body mind and soul do you
[57:48] believe that I believe that with all of
[57:51] my heart amen amen so now in the
[57:54] scripture we just read now if anybody
[57:57] here is in the medical field if you get
[57:59] a real deep cut on your body you can try
[58:02] to Band-Aids ain't going to do it you
[58:05] can stick all the Band-Aids you want on
[58:07] it that's not going to be sufficient
[58:09] enough you have to go through a high
[58:11] level than that to go to stitches or
[58:14] either Staples now if you don't put
[58:16] little bandages all over that wound
[58:18] what's going to happen Gang Green can
[58:20] set in and diseases could set in then
[58:24] you might say I better go to the doctor
[58:26] now and get something fixed now if you
[58:28] go to the doctor he's not going to spray
[58:30] nothing on top of that wound and then
[58:32] patch it up and say go on that's not
[58:34] what he's going to do he going to have
[58:36] to reopen
[58:37] it he will reopen that womb which will
[58:40] be more painful than the wound itself is
[58:43] to reopen it but when he reopen it he
[58:46] will get it set for the right healing
[58:48] that it needs to to get healed right
[58:50] right painful but the healing will take
[58:53] place because it been dealt with careful
[58:56] and I believe that's why the message is
[58:58] so precise every area you can think of
[59:02] whether dealing with children husband
[59:04] wives Church there's things in the
[59:07] message that would bring healing to the
[59:09] body God cover every area amen because
[59:13] the main thing is for the wounds to be
[59:17] healed properly that's the main thing
[59:20] right there can we say praise the Lord
[59:23] now dealing with wounds and bruises and
[59:26] pain and so forth we all go through them
[59:29] things always happen some of them are
[59:31] more crucial than others you know
[59:34] children go through bruises children go
[59:36] through hardships and then we have to be
[59:39] as parents we got to have that
[59:40] discernment to realize what our child is
[59:42] going through you know sometimes uh uh I
[59:46] got a young girl in my church the
[59:48] parents just get aggravated with her I
[59:50] mean they just get aggravated this girl
[59:52] I just don't know what's wrong with her
[59:54] and then they might discipline her and
[59:55] she seems to get worse and seemed to get
[59:57] worse but what the problem was she was
[1:00:01] getting picked on at school and she
[1:00:03] never told her parents see when a child
[1:00:06] get picked on at school and get and get
[1:00:08] bullied on and so forth they hold a lot
[1:00:10] of stuff inside and they start getting
[1:00:12] rebellious and then the parents start
[1:00:14] disciplin them they get more rebellious
[1:00:17] so you need to go and find out why is my
[1:00:19] child acting this way and that's what
[1:00:21] they was missing she was getting picked
[1:00:23] on at school bringing it home amen so
[1:00:27] spanking them wasn't going to heal that
[1:00:29] hurt heal that wound they had to
[1:00:32] approach that thing go to the school
[1:00:34] talk to the people in school find the
[1:00:36] kids that do it work with it to bring
[1:00:38] healing to that child and then doing
[1:00:41] that the child would realize my parent
[1:00:43] cares about me they just don't want to
[1:00:45] be hitting on me they're trying to help
[1:00:47] me solve this problem then it brings
[1:00:49] fellowship with the family amen can we
[1:00:51] say amen that's just a proper way trying
[1:00:53] to heal a wound that's right praise Lord
[1:00:56] are we all right
[1:00:57] tonight praise God let's go on a little
[1:01:01] further
[1:01:03] forgiveness the power of forgiveness we
[1:01:06] can go by this many different ways even
[1:01:09] how Jesus Christ come to forgive us for
[1:01:11] our sins that brings a power of release
[1:01:15] but one thing I like about the Lord he
[1:01:17] ain't like you and me he can forgive and
[1:01:20] forget we can forgive but we still
[1:01:22] remember can we say amen amen I I was
[1:01:26] talking to a young man just the other
[1:01:27] day when you got pain or or wounds even
[1:01:31] in your body the way that you know
[1:01:33] you've been spiritually healed properly
[1:01:37] by the word of God is when you could
[1:01:39] think about something somebody done to
[1:01:41] you and you no longer feel the
[1:01:44] pain but if you can think about
[1:01:46] something somebody done and and you
[1:01:48] start feeling
[1:01:50] that that means that something's still
[1:01:53] there it ain't been fixed but God wants
[1:01:56] to fix it you know sometimes uh somebody
[1:01:59] might offend you in the church they
[1:02:01] actually how many of you know sometimes
[1:02:02] somebody can offend you in the church
[1:02:04] and didn't even mean to do it and you
[1:02:06] think they did it they actually Innocent
[1:02:09] but what people go wrong at when
[1:02:11] somebody might say something out of turn
[1:02:14] and it might not even meant that way and
[1:02:17] they felt like oh they talking about me
[1:02:19] then they hold it in their
[1:02:20] heart hello see when you hold it in your
[1:02:24] heart that allows the enemy to come in
[1:02:27] now and build on that so that's why the
[1:02:31] best thing to do that's one reason why
[1:02:32] I'm a straight up front person somebody
[1:02:35] say something I don't like I just tell
[1:02:36] them and I just say hey brother I I
[1:02:39] didn't appreciate that
[1:02:40] that well I do got a different approach
[1:02:43] I just say let me repeat to you what you
[1:02:45] just said I want to make sure did you
[1:02:48] mean what you just mean and I repeat it
[1:02:50] and they say yeah that's what I meant I
[1:02:52] said I said brother I didn't appreciate
[1:02:54] that that's just the way that I am cuz
[1:02:57] some I'm not going to hold it cuz if I
[1:02:59] hold it I know what it's going to do to
[1:03:00] me I'm a living example what it'll do
[1:03:03] when I see that brother I might be
[1:03:05] smiling in church shaking his hand but
[1:03:07] I'm going to be thinking about what he
[1:03:09] said that won't be no Fellowship so the
[1:03:12] best thing to do bring it in the open
[1:03:14] talk about it so we can have fellowship
[1:03:17] and Crush that devil because we are not
[1:03:20] one another enemy The Devil is the enemy
[1:03:24] he is the one that we want to attack not
[1:03:27] each other but the
[1:03:29] enemy can we say praise the Lord all
[1:03:32] right it's going a little
[1:03:39] father let me just give you a personal
[1:03:44] testimony I believe in
[1:03:48] healing totally I I believe in that I do
[1:03:51] I really
[1:03:53] do because I didn't have a e life myself
[1:03:57] but God knows how to mold us and we go
[1:04:02] through things just for in the future
[1:04:05] and then we see things pass years pass
[1:04:09] things happen in life then he'll take us
[1:04:11] back he's saying this is why this is why
[1:04:15] I took you through that you see brother
[1:04:18] brandham lost his family because of
[1:04:20] disobedience is that right so
[1:04:23] Disobedience caus God to do things but
[1:04:26] he didn't hold it against God he was
[1:04:29] fixing to but thank God for the seed cuz
[1:04:33] he said if if he going to be like that
[1:04:35] then
[1:04:35] I it stopped them from blaspheming
[1:04:39] cursing God because the seed was there
[1:04:42] can we say praise the Lord so that's why
[1:04:44] many things go in our lives we never say
[1:04:47] nothing bad towards God but we can do it
[1:04:50] towards each other and make no
[1:04:53] difference which way you put it it's
[1:04:54] wrong
[1:04:56] are you with me you know
[1:04:59] unforgiveness when a person have
[1:05:01] unforgiveness in their life it actually
[1:05:04] leads to
[1:05:05] bitterness and then bitterness could
[1:05:07] lead to hate then hate could lead to
[1:05:10] just being despising it get worse and it
[1:05:14] get worse and it get worse so the
[1:05:16] important thing is to stop it when it
[1:05:19] starts can you say amen amen and
[1:05:22] forgiveness unforgiveness actually it
[1:05:25] will control you amen that's what it'll
[1:05:28] do we don't want it to control us but it
[1:05:31] will control
[1:05:32] us you
[1:05:35] know in my life I just you'll know a
[1:05:38] little bit more about me I just give you
[1:05:39] a little testimony here in my life I
[1:05:43] grew up 23 years of I would
[1:05:49] say 18 years I grew up 18 years of my
[1:05:54] life with hate and
[1:05:58] unforgiveness and want to pay back so
[1:06:01] I'm speaking from experience I grew up
[1:06:04] 18 years like that because I didn't have
[1:06:08] a a good life like many have but I don't
[1:06:11] go back and cry about that now I thank
[1:06:13] God now because I see why I had to go
[1:06:16] through what I went through Hallelujah
[1:06:18] and one thing God built me up I see now
[1:06:20] the things that I went through God
[1:06:22] helped me to help young people I preach
[1:06:24] a lot of Youth meetings it's simply
[1:06:26] because God designed me from my youth to
[1:06:29] be able to relate and he T me through
[1:06:31] some things and one thing about pain and
[1:06:34] hurt brothers and sisters I know how it
[1:06:37] controls and it don't want to let go but
[1:06:40] then I know the power of God how God can
[1:06:43] just take care of all those things pull
[1:06:45] them completely out of your life and you
[1:06:46] just can become a new creation a new
[1:06:48] creature in Christ Jesus I guess I'm not
[1:06:52] saying I'm going to say something not to
[1:06:53] be sorrowful but just give you kind of a
[1:06:55] IDE idea what I've been through
[1:06:57] myself the the the biggest hurt the
[1:07:01] biggest bruise that I evered in my life
[1:07:04] is when I lost my mother my mother was
[1:07:07] killed and the thing what brings it to
[1:07:10] the painful situation my father killed
[1:07:13] my mother and I was actually sitting in
[1:07:15] my mother lap when my father killed her
[1:07:19] and I'm going tell you something as a
[1:07:21] child I relive it every day I think
[1:07:23] about my mother I think about what my
[1:07:25] father did I could see her every day
[1:07:28] laying on the floor grasping for breath
[1:07:31] I see it every day that right there at
[1:07:33] the age of six it created bitterness
[1:07:37] hatred in my heart against my
[1:07:40] father now at the age of six there was
[1:07:43] nothing that I could do but when my
[1:07:45] father got out of jail he got out of
[1:07:48] jail I was at the age of 12 because my
[1:07:51] father was able to do some manipulation
[1:07:52] to get out of jail a whole lot earlier
[1:07:54] because he was a working for the judge
[1:07:57] but what happened when my father got out
[1:07:59] of jail the only thing that I was
[1:08:01] interested in I was trying to devise a
[1:08:04] plan how I was going to kill him I mean
[1:08:07] you can't help but think that way I was
[1:08:08] just a child and I just wanted to pay
[1:08:11] this man back so what happened he got
[1:08:14] out of jail and he come up to me you
[1:08:16] know hey son and all this that didn't
[1:08:18] mean nothing to
[1:08:19] me because I was bruised I hated him it
[1:08:24] was no forgiveness there you see when
[1:08:26] somebody when there's no forgiveness
[1:08:29] there people can even try to be good to
[1:08:31] you but that hurt and pain blocks all of
[1:08:35] that out you won't see nobody good the
[1:08:37] only thing it'll drive you to do is to
[1:08:40] see what they done wrong that just the
[1:08:42] bottom line so to make a long story
[1:08:45] y'all don't mind I give you just a
[1:08:46] little testimony is that
[1:08:50] okay well let me back up just a little
[1:08:54] bit
[1:08:57] when my mother died it was eight of us I
[1:09:00] got four boys and it was four
[1:09:03] girls one of them going on now but you
[1:09:07] know uh we lived in a a little complex
[1:09:11] where my father my grandfather had land
[1:09:14] and all his children lived on the land
[1:09:16] so when my father done what he did we
[1:09:19] had no choice to go move and live with
[1:09:21] my grandmother but when we lived there
[1:09:24] all of my cousins and my aunts and
[1:09:25] uncles they all lived on the property
[1:09:28] now you would
[1:09:29] think that you don't have such a tragedy
[1:09:32] losing your mama people would feel sorry
[1:09:35] for you but that was the opposite for us
[1:09:38] we got treated like dogs and the reason
[1:09:42] why my dad killed their sister so now
[1:09:47] they are hurt but they took it out on us
[1:09:49] we didn't do it that was my mama but
[1:09:52] they took it out on us you know I had a
[1:09:55] this woman just hated me I I don't know
[1:09:58] if y'all ever experienced this I have
[1:10:00] experien where people can hate so much
[1:10:04] that when they talk to you you can feel
[1:10:06] it I've experienced that as a child so
[1:10:09] what I done this aunt she just couldn't
[1:10:12] stand me we got beat for things that we
[1:10:15] didn't do we got blamed for things that
[1:10:17] we didn't do what was happening out of
[1:10:20] all of this it was building hate it was
[1:10:23] building Payback I'll pay them back one
[1:10:26] day and I never forget you know you know
[1:10:30] uh all my cousins could get the toys
[1:10:32] that they want one thing I always have
[1:10:35] said about Santa Claus I said if he was
[1:10:38] real he was cheap cuz I got used stuff
[1:10:42] my cousin got new stuff he's not fair
[1:10:45] that's what I felt about Old Santa Claus
[1:10:46] which we know he ain't real
[1:10:48] anyway but I'm saying this for a
[1:10:50] reason when I begin to see my cousins
[1:10:53] have new stuff and I got use stuff you
[1:10:56] know what that start driving me to steal
[1:10:59] it I said I want new stuff why can't I
[1:11:02] have it then they well look with your
[1:11:04] daddy you ain't got no Mama you ain't
[1:11:05] got no Daddy I said but I want new stuff
[1:11:07] and you talking about the age of eight
[1:11:09] going around age of 10 walking away
[1:11:12] going to department stores then I start
[1:11:15] stealing that don't justify wrong is
[1:11:19] wrong but what happened I started
[1:11:21] stealing at a young age and before the
[1:11:24] Lord got hope to me at the age of 23
[1:11:27] that steing turned into
[1:11:30] Robin uh I mean I mean just doing crazy
[1:11:33] stuff arm robbery I done that all that
[1:11:35] stuff I'm not bragging on that I'm just
[1:11:36] telling you when something is set wrong
[1:11:39] never fixed it just keep adding to go
[1:11:41] wrong until that there is a change amen
[1:11:46] so what happened all through my life
[1:11:49] around the age of 12 and I did try to
[1:11:52] kill my daddy I actually did but I
[1:11:53] didn't succeed but I'm thankful today I
[1:11:57] didn't succeed cuz I would have to live
[1:11:59] with that right now but it to bring any
[1:12:02] light to the story when I come to the
[1:12:04] message I let my daddy to the
[1:12:06] Lord because I couldn't hate him no more
[1:12:09] hallah Luke 4 was fulfilled in my life I
[1:12:13] couldn't have set them free that was
[1:12:14] bruised the captives so now I couldn't
[1:12:17] hate this man no more I said he needed
[1:12:18] God I don't know what happened between
[1:12:20] him and my mama but all I know now I've
[1:12:22] Been Changed now I've got to have comp
[1:12:25] passion for another soul and by God's
[1:12:28] grace we led him to him before he died
[1:12:31] amen but you
[1:12:36] know I was sharing this with you
[1:12:38] Pastor I was just a straight out Thug
[1:12:42] all I thought about was
[1:12:44] crying and I'm GNA be honest with you my
[1:12:48] career was going to be a professional
[1:12:51] thief and you know where I got that from
[1:12:54] television
[1:12:56] that's why people don't realize that
[1:12:57] certain things they let their children
[1:12:59] look at it affects them differently from
[1:13:01] you you have to be careful what you let
[1:13:04] them listen to careful what you let them

[1:19:03] church I saw my wife family clapping
[1:19:07] their hand her brothers was in there I
[1:19:09] used to run around with her brothers I
[1:19:10] just knew it'd be a matter of time
[1:19:12] they'll be back but you know what when I
[1:19:15] went into the
[1:19:16] church I realized they were happy
[1:19:20] amen I said man they clapping and
[1:19:24] singing singing a song How Great Is Our
[1:19:27] God how great is the word you know I was
[1:19:29] listening to it but I had my own tune to
[1:19:32] it but I was listening I said man the
[1:19:35] people
[1:19:36] happy and then all of a sudden here come
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:39] preacher the man that don't stole my
[1:19:42] girl I look at the preacher come out
[1:19:45] look at your bald head I'm
[1:19:47] criticizing cuz I'm mad I'm mad look at
[1:19:51] it just look at it then I just start
[1:19:53] this critiquing to me you
[1:19:55] know yeah yeah don't even look at a
[1:20:01] cook and then all the sudden when he
[1:20:04] start
[1:20:05] preaching when that man start
[1:20:07] preaching I said this sounds right let
[1:20:10] me explain something to you friend when
[1:20:13] I went to church that one time I've been
[1:20:15] in church ever
[1:20:17] since just from that seeing something
[1:20:20] real and my wife caught my attention
[1:20:25] that's what caught my attention now I
[1:20:27] can go on now it's a whole long
[1:20:28] testimony if any of you you like to hear
[1:20:30] my testimony you can go on Jeff the
[1:20:32] website in Li Ohio I gave it there but
[1:20:36] that right there changed everything
[1:20:37] right there in my life because I let
[1:20:40] Christ come into my life and that's what
[1:20:43] changed and that what brought the
[1:20:46] Forgiveness that's what did it you see I
[1:20:49] learned one thing friends when true
[1:20:52] forgiveness is not there old past hurts
[1:20:56] and pains will always have a right to
[1:21:00] resurface and I'm saying they have a
[1:21:02] right because they
[1:21:04] do that's the Bible even Jesus said
[1:21:06] himself you don't forgive neither will
[1:21:08] my heavenly Father in Heaven forgive
[1:21:11] you so we've been challenged in the
[1:21:13] message of the hour to
[1:21:16] forgive It's Hard In the Flesh to
[1:21:19] forgive somebody for something and they
[1:21:21] are in the wrong but God requires us to
[1:21:24] St
[1:21:25] forgiven that's not easily done in the
[1:21:28] flesh but by the spirit of Christ it is
[1:21:32] you can let it go because when you
[1:21:34] forgive somebody for something you're
[1:21:36] not only releasing them you're releasing
[1:21:40] yourself just kind of the way that it
[1:21:42] goes can we say praise the Lord so how
[1:21:45] many of you ever read domestic disease
[1:21:47] and
[1:21:48] afflictions ain't no way I can get
[1:21:50] through with this brother be but I'll
[1:21:51] just give some more
[1:21:53] testimonies it's still on the
[1:21:56] subject in the message disease and
[1:21:59] affliction the prophet of God talks
[1:22:01] about a Cancer and a Tuma and he begins
[1:22:04] to explain how that these things happen
[1:22:08] he said a a cancer or tumor he said word
[1:22:12] start it starts from a bruised he said
[1:22:16] starts from a bruised cell he said what
[1:22:19] happened that cell get bruised he said
[1:22:22] then that cell backslides
[1:22:25] he said then it stops the flow of the
[1:22:26] blood that should run freely through it
[1:22:29] once it stops the flow of the blood he
[1:22:31] said that cancer will begin to stack up
[1:22:34] like
[1:22:35] pancakes go layer upon layer upon layer
[1:22:38] upon layer he said that what will begin
[1:22:40] to happen and it all starts from a
[1:22:43] bruise are you with me yes so when I
[1:22:46] begin to study that I studied this years
[1:22:48] ago and then he brought it to the
[1:22:50] spiritual and that's the exact same
[1:22:52] thing he said that's the same thing a
[1:22:54] happen in the church something can
[1:22:56] happen in the church us backsliding in a
[1:22:59] member and then when a member backslid
[1:23:01] sit in church it can start spreading the
[1:23:03] csel in the church he said the main
[1:23:05] thing when something is bruised is heal
[1:23:08] the backslid for it starts stacking up
[1:23:12] and packing up can we say praise the
[1:23:14] Lord let me just give you for nobody I
[1:23:17] don't want nobody to think I'm person
[1:23:18] attacking them but I know exactly what's
[1:23:20] going on I just use myself as a example
[1:23:24] even a true example I would use myself
[1:23:27] because I know how these things work now
[1:23:31] marriage
[1:23:33] life I think one of the greatest things
[1:23:36] that hurt in marriage is when we lose
[1:23:38] our first love of the
[1:23:42] marriage hello praise the Lord how many
[1:23:45] of you can remember the first time you

[1:30:35] longer I'm trying to finish this because
[1:30:38] I can show you what happened the
[1:30:40] children up through the adult line
[1:30:43] through the church I preached on this
[1:30:45] before it's a series bruises of the
[1:30:48] pastor bruises of the church bruises of
[1:30:51] the children bruises of the wife bruises
[1:30:54] is of the husband all of them got their
[1:30:56] own
[1:30:57] category even though they all got their
[1:30:59] own category it's one solution for every
[1:31:02] one of them is the
[1:31:04] word but it depends on what happened how
[1:31:07] you handle it by the word that solved
[1:31:09] the problem can we say praise the Lord
[1:31:13] amen you
[1:31:15] know as a
[1:31:19] man and I understand
[1:31:22] this when the prophet of God
[1:31:24] talks about even a
[1:31:26] housewife he made a statement that when
[1:31:29] a man would come home to his
[1:31:32] Queen he said and everything is in order
[1:31:36] he said everything that kind of stress
[1:31:38] and the things that happened on the job
[1:31:41] he said it leaves
[1:31:42] him he said he just forgets about it and
[1:31:46] that is the truth I don't know if you
[1:31:49] got housewives in here or not but I can
[1:31:51] tell you something sister you can set
[1:31:54] such an atmosphere in your home even
[1:31:56] when your husband come home with a
[1:31:57] little Spirit on him it could cast it
[1:32:00] off of
[1:32:01] him but if he come home he got a spirit
[1:32:04] when I mean by Spirit sometimes it's not
[1:32:07] I'm not talking about nothing if dealing
[1:32:09] with morals or nothing like that I'm
[1:32:11] talking about even stress of the day
[1:32:13] because things could have happened on
[1:32:14] the job could got in with it with a
[1:32:16] coworker or the boss man deliberately
[1:32:18] does something and then it's offended
[1:32:20] him now he could come home and that's a
[1:32:22] lot of time with me mess up bringing
[1:32:25] that home when they should deal with it
[1:32:27] where is at and then don't bring that
[1:32:29] spirit in the house how many of you read
[1:32:31] the quote the prophet God said if one
[1:32:33] member of the family get nervous he said
[1:32:35] the whole family should get nervous
[1:32:38] because it's a
[1:32:39] spirit
[1:32:41] amen children can be in their room
[1:32:44] playing with the TOs having a good time
[1:32:47] and then the parents can start arguing
[1:32:49] in the other room for you know you hear
[1:32:51] the children fighting with each other
[1:32:53] the spirit actually travel through the
[1:32:55] house that's exactly what happens I'm
[1:32:57] just telling you I can give you the
[1:32:59] quote on that so those are the things
[1:33:02] that we have to look forward to how many
[1:33:03] of you know Church don't start
[1:33:07] here church starts at
[1:33:09] home we are the real people at
[1:33:13] home we come to church and act churchy
[1:33:17] but we're the real one when we're at
[1:33:18] home that's who you are when we walk in
[1:33:21] the doors brothers and sisters whatever
[1:33:24] spirit is in your house that's what you
[1:33:26] bring in the church that's a fact can we
[1:33:29] say Amen but I'm preaching
[1:33:31] Deliverance because I know we've been
[1:33:34] called to live higher than these things
[1:33:37] but I'm just trying to show how the
[1:33:38] enemy can slip in little foxes that
[1:33:41] small Divine that do the simplest little
[1:33:43] thing and it causes
[1:33:45] problems but we got to stand up with our
[1:33:48] Christian right and say not so this is
[1:33:49] my house dedicated to the Lord Jesus
[1:33:52] Christ Satan you're not welcome here
[1:33:54] amen and deal with those things can we
[1:33:56] say praise the Lord you
[1:33:59] know I just give you another
[1:34:04] example sometimes I might offend my
[1:34:07] wife and don't even know
[1:34:11] it I don't understand it sometimes I
[1:34:14] apologize honey I really didn't for
[1:34:16] forgive me about the other day I really
[1:34:18] didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to
[1:34:19] offend you she said you didn't offend
[1:34:22] me like I did
[1:34:24] and I didn't and then sometimes she tell
[1:34:28] me uh you you done this and
[1:34:32] this what I didn't do it I didn't mean
[1:34:34] to do it so when I think I offended her
[1:34:36] I didn't but when I offend her and then
[1:34:38] she said don't bother me cuz let me just
[1:34:40] give you a good example one time I got a
[1:34:42] little Spirit on I'm just being real
[1:34:44] with you I'm being real I got a little
[1:34:47] Spirit on me I can't remember what
[1:34:48] happened uh my wife said something and
[1:34:51] it really bothered me this been years
[1:34:53] ago we a whole lot more more mature than
[1:34:54] that now and uh she said something and I
[1:34:58] didn't like it and she was trying to
[1:35:00] talk to
[1:35:02] me and I was trying to be
[1:35:05] sarcastic she would say something I'd be
[1:35:08] sarcastic or say something funny but she
[1:35:11] wasn't getting
[1:35:12] mad I was actually trying to make her
[1:35:15] mad but the more that I tried the
[1:35:18] happier she
[1:35:20] got
[1:35:22] hello
[1:35:24] I said I said something offend her and
[1:35:27] she just kept
[1:35:29] smiling said she ain't getting mad and
[1:35:32] more I say the happier she got and I
[1:35:34] start getting
[1:35:38] mad I said she just hey what's going
[1:35:43] on and I said she loving me and it's
[1:35:48] killing me I'm trying to make her mad
[1:35:51] but she's loving me you know what
[1:35:53] happened happened it cast the spirit off
[1:35:55] of

[1:36:00] spirit off of me I I was trying to be
[1:36:03] hateful but you kept loving

[1:39:29] historians what do historious what do
[1:39:32] history do takes you to the
[1:39:36] past and when you hold stuff in your
[1:39:38] heart that's what you become a
[1:39:41] historian honey you okay ain't nothing
[1:39:43] wrong with me you sure then all of a
[1:39:45] sudden here come the history class oh
[1:39:48] you don't remember you don't remember
[1:39:50] what you done what did I do it was 6
[1:39:52] months ago go we was at your daddy house
[1:39:56] you had on a blue shirt and you had on
[1:39:58] your church shoes that day you don't
[1:39:59] remember what you said and it was
[1:40:06] 5:00 see that's the way a woman
[1:40:09] thinks she can
[1:40:11] detail
[1:40:15] everything right to the letter and then
[1:40:18] repeat what you you said I don't
[1:40:19] remember say oh yes you do I can tell
[1:40:21] you exactly what you said
[1:40:25] and it works from a
[1:40:28] bruise just because you wouldn't talk
[1:40:30] about it the right way and settle it
[1:40:35] it'll build up just like those
[1:40:37] pancakes I'm just being honest with your
[1:40:40] friends that's where
[1:40:43] forgiveness will have to come into play
[1:40:46] CU if forgiveness don't take place and
[1:40:48] you don't handled it according to the
[1:40:49] word guess what happen it gets worse
[1:40:53] worse and worse and it'll keep
[1:40:56] resurfacing because she never fix it and
[1:40:58] the devil's sitting back laughing yeah
[1:41:01] that's right tell him that too you yeah
[1:41:02] the devil will help you with your memory
[1:41:05] that's but you can kill that just by
[1:41:08] saying this is wrong we need peace in
[1:41:10] this house we need unity in this house
[1:41:12] let me just kill this right now that's
[1:41:15] the way that it works somebody got to be
[1:41:17] willing to stand up and say hey let's
[1:41:19] talk things ain't been going right we
[1:41:21] need to kill the spirit and then by that
[1:41:24] confession and that forgiveness you will
[1:41:26] literally feel those spirits
[1:41:29] leave and then when that's done bound it
[1:41:32] up in
[1:41:33] prayer let me explain something brothers
[1:41:35] and sisters how many of you ever read
[1:41:37] the quote the prophet of God said we
[1:41:38] going to always make
[1:41:40] mistakes anybody read that let me
[1:41:43] explain something to you
[1:41:45] friends that's okay that's a good quote
[1:41:50] but if you ain't reading it right it'll
[1:41:52] back by
[1:41:53] sure we going to make mistakes but you
[1:41:56] need to make new
[1:41:59] ones the same old mistake over and over
[1:42:02] and over is not a
[1:42:05] mistake hello amen that need to be some
[1:42:08] Deliverance
[1:42:10] somewhere let me give you an example
[1:42:12] what's your name brother brother John if
[1:42:15] I was to be walking right here and I was
[1:42:17] to slip and go bow hit brother John and
[1:42:21] he seemed I tripped forgive me he said
[1:42:25] brother Bley don't you worry about it no
[1:42:26] problem that was a mistake I said thank
[1:42:30] you brother John then I go
[1:42:33] bow what you think he'll do then whoa
[1:42:36] brother something wrong that wasn't a
[1:42:39] mistake something wrong with you brother
[1:42:43] see first one was second one
[1:42:47] wasn't so sometime we can justify
[1:42:49] mistakes we keep trying to we can we can
[1:42:52] try to justify some something that need
[1:42:54] to be some Deliverance we'll keep
[1:42:56] calling it mistake when it's not a
[1:42:58] mistake it's something that needs some
[1:43:00] spiritual
[1:43:01] attention to kill it and to cush it I'm
[1:43:05] not trying to beat you down church I'm
[1:43:06] just pouring my heart out to you because
[1:43:08] I don't believe in whacking people down
[1:43:10] but I believe in Deliverance amen
[1:43:12] because when you expose something is one
[1:43:14] thing but once it's exposed deal with it
[1:43:17] and kill it that's the other thing can
[1:43:20] we say praise the lord lord I seen these
[1:43:22] things
[1:43:25] I seen parents bruise the
[1:43:27] children I seen it you know the worst
[1:43:31] thing a parent could ever
[1:43:33] do is to compare their child with
[1:43:37] somebody else's child amen that's the
[1:43:39] worst you can ever do that's right you
[1:43:41] know you get your child why you acting
[1:43:44] like that look at him he don't act like
[1:43:47] church like you act you need to stop
[1:43:49] that behave yourself have some manners
[1:43:51] like him but look at you your child
[1:43:53] doing like
[1:43:56] there you know what's going to happen he
[1:44:00] going to keep it right there yeah one
[1:44:02] day the children might be out playing
[1:44:05] church and you hear something go ah you
[1:44:08] know what happened the child you
[1:44:10] compared to he hit
[1:44:13] him yeah he going to see that little
[1:44:19] child looking at
[1:44:22] him then hearing your words comparing it
[1:44:25] then I say he just
[1:44:27] go they let off his pressure yeah
[1:44:30] because what you built up in it
[1:44:33] yeah
[1:44:35] hello it's wrong amen I see it over and
[1:44:40] over and over again and I even tell I
[1:44:42] teach this to my church don't do that
[1:44:46] because it builds up things in the child
[1:44:49] life can you say amen I don't seen
[1:44:51] Brothers make mistake you you know what
[1:44:53] I am very
[1:44:55] smart whenever we have a church
[1:44:57] dinner picnic or whatever I make sure I
[1:45:00] eat my wife
[1:45:04] food I'm just business oh she's a
[1:45:07] perfect cook but I'm going to make sure
[1:45:09] if I eat any dish it going to be
[1:45:12] heard cuz I know better I'm just being
[1:45:15] honest with you I've seen people at
[1:45:19] church
[1:45:20] functions because everybody eating
[1:45:24] everybody else food is getting eaten and
[1:45:26] then they see their is not getting eaten
[1:45:28] and they let a spirit get on them yeah
[1:45:31] then the devil come they don't even like
[1:45:33] your food then be
[1:45:37] like sure don't y'all want to try
[1:45:40] something this oh with f you see there
[1:45:42] now they lying to you they just don't
[1:45:44] want your
[1:45:46] food and they get spirits on them they
[1:45:49] take their little pot of beans and their
[1:45:51] little spirit and go on with it and mope
[1:45:54] over
[1:45:55] it I seen
[1:45:57] it what I'm preaching to you brothers
[1:45:59] and sisters we supposed to be way above
[1:46:01] that because this is adoption time we
[1:46:04] are in adoption season where we should
[1:46:07] know how to handle those things my wife
[1:46:09] said did you like my food yes ma'am it's
[1:46:12] delicious and I'm not lying because
[1:46:13] I'mma tell you right now that's why
[1:46:15] brother I teach my own church the young
[1:46:17] girl they say they want to get married I
[1:46:19] said you make sure you learn how to cook
[1:46:20] and take care of a house before you get
[1:46:22] married
[1:46:23] don't let your husband be your guinea
[1:46:25] pig let your daddy and your brother be
[1:46:27] your guinea
[1:46:31] pigs so when you marri a man he could be
[1:46:35] blessed cuz I'm going tell you right now
[1:46:37] when me and my wife first got married I
[1:46:39] think she thought I was an alar she gave
[1:46:41] me a lot of burnt
[1:46:43] offerings she couldn't cook and the
[1:46:46] reason why cuz the way she was raised I
[1:46:48] was raised we was raised
[1:46:51] wrong but now we coming into the word
[1:46:53] learning how to live all over again now
[1:46:56] she's the best cook in the world but I
[1:46:58] was her guinea
[1:47:00] pig and guess what I wasn't a man I was
[1:47:04] a young man no wisdom she had to
[1:47:07] suffer because of my thinking and my
[1:47:10] boyish ways cuz I wasn't into my manhood
[1:47:13] she suffered from that that's why when I
[1:47:16] preach at youth meeting now let him say
[1:47:18] grow up while you're at home live a life
[1:47:21] of singl with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:22] Christ overcome your youthful lust while
[1:47:26] you're single so you won't drag that
[1:47:28] baggage into your marriage that's what I
[1:47:30] promotes to the young
[1:47:32] people because marriage itself is
[1:47:36] pressure it's going to it attracts it
[1:47:39] because when you get married you know
[1:47:42] what really happening it's two different
[1:47:45] households
[1:47:46] class that's what it is here's the thing
[1:47:51] you come out of your honeymoon and one
[1:47:53] thing when you come off your honeymoon
[1:47:54] you make sure you leave honey on the
[1:47:56] moon hello make sure you keep everything
[1:48:00] sweet you come into you finally come
[1:48:03] together you know what
[1:48:05] happened I didn't do like that at my
[1:48:07] house well I didn't do like that at my
[1:48:09] house things start clashing but to solve
[1:48:12] those problems and say okay that's the
[1:48:15] way you did at your house that's where I
[1:48:17] did it in my house let's come together
[1:48:19] how we going to do it in our house let's
[1:48:22] stop the clashes from the different
[1:48:24] houses I tell the young boy I said I
[1:48:27] said I'm going tell you son I said one
[1:48:29] thing you don't never want to do I said
[1:48:31] you offend your wife I should never tell
[1:48:34] her you don't cook like my
[1:48:37] mama I said don't do that I said mother
[1:48:40] than lik she might tell you while go
[1:48:41] home let your mama kick you something
[1:48:42] then I said brother don't do that it
[1:48:45] cuts her it does so a lot of little
[1:48:48] things that happen in early states of
[1:48:51] marriages that even son won't fix they
[1:48:54] find it later on in they marri it starts
[1:48:56] surfacing up again just because it
[1:48:58] wasn't
[1:48:59] fixed but the power of
[1:49:02] forgiveness it goes a long way can we
[1:49:04] say praise the Lord I'm trying to finish
[1:49:07] musicians can start coming then I know
[1:49:09] I'll finish but it's the truth brothers
[1:49:12] and sisters the power of
[1:49:16] forgiveness I've seen the good I seen
[1:49:19] the bad but the good always the bad amen
[1:49:23] how you handle things by the word of God
[1:49:25] and it brings a
[1:49:28] change the
[1:49:30] enemy you know sometimes people can get
[1:49:32] offended in
[1:49:35] church and I watched it through the
[1:49:37] years sometime when a person just really
[1:49:40] offended and they letting the devil get
[1:49:41] the best of them they'll usually be
[1:49:43] start when the service is over they'll
[1:49:45] usually start being the first one
[1:49:46] walking out to church because they're
[1:49:49] offended and sometime the devil can get
[1:49:52] people to a place face they'll Stand Out
[1:49:53] by the church and then the devil be like
[1:49:56] you know so and so ain't going to shake
[1:49:57] your hand oh I know they ain't they
[1:49:58] going to walk right by me they ain't
[1:50:00] even going to shake my hand just because
[1:50:02] you expecting that looking for that they
[1:50:03] won't shake your hand just because you
[1:50:06] look for that that's the way the enemy
[1:50:09] operates but I believe in Breaking
[1:50:11] Chains amen that's why I like being
[1:50:13] honest with my brothers I being like
[1:50:15] being honest with my sisters and being
[1:50:17] honest with myself I break the chain and
[1:50:20] sometimes I be wrong if I feel like
[1:50:22] somebody even offended me sometime I'll
[1:50:24] get them aside say bro look I could be
[1:50:28] wrong but I'm feeling this from you and
[1:50:31] shut sh sh and then they said brother
[1:50:33] Burley that ain't nowhere in my mind I
[1:50:35] don't feel nothing like that right that
[1:50:36] and I said you forgive me for let the
[1:50:38] enemy put that in my mind kill it and
[1:50:41] crush it and I said pray for me I did
[1:50:43] not go on about my way that don't make
[1:50:45] me no smaller that don't make me no
[1:50:47] bigger but it show up bringing me closer
[1:50:49] to the Lord and then I me and my brother
[1:50:52] and my sister have clear Fellowship no
[1:50:55] thinking wrong that's why you know I
[1:50:56] don't say nothing bad about people
[1:50:58] children if I say something about
[1:51:00] somebody's child I'll say it to them
[1:51:03] with the
[1:51:04] concern that's what I do and people
[1:51:07] still get mad when you do that because
[1:51:10] people get offended with the children we
[1:51:12] as Believers should be so higher and a
[1:51:15] higher level we can talk to one another
[1:51:17] about things cuz when I say something
[1:51:19] about somebody's child it's something
[1:51:20] that I don't been through with mine and
[1:51:22] see the same pattern and I'm trying to
[1:51:24] say look if you don't stop this brother
[1:51:27] this is what's going to happen please
[1:51:29] learn from it and some listen some don't
[1:51:32] but the main thing I express what's in
[1:51:35] my heart because I want to help them not
[1:51:37] to hurt him can we give the Lord a
[1:51:42] hand praise the
[1:51:44] Lord I won't go no more let's just power
[1:51:49] here Lord Jesus there many things could
[1:51:52] have been ministered on
[1:51:55] tonight I even thought that in my own
[1:51:58] heart would probably be a little
[1:52:01] Evangelistic but I see that's not so
[1:52:04] that's the songs was being sung Lord I
[1:52:06] can see what your spirit was leading and
[1:52:08] I can see that it where it was
[1:52:11] guiding but now Lord I just ask and pray
[1:52:13] oh God that the word just be received in
[1:52:15] the hearts and like the brother was
[1:52:18] praying that it be received in the heart
[1:52:20] but mixed with faith
[1:52:23] the word didn't profit them because they
[1:52:25] didn't have it mixed with faith but may
[1:52:27] we mix it with faith and say Lord I know
[1:52:30] you come to speak to me I know you come
[1:52:32] to help me Lord I wasn't putting my
[1:52:34] finger at nobody but I sure was poting
[1:52:37] at the Devil cuz he's the one that we
[1:52:39] want to expose Lord we're your bride and
[1:52:42] I believe that we are in the season of
[1:52:44] adoption where we'll know our place we
[1:52:46] know our position we know how to handle
[1:52:49] circumstances and anything that you plac
[1:52:51] before us we be will know what you want
[1:52:53] done with the word Lord that's what I
[1:52:55] honestly believe so father even though
[1:52:58] we laughed a little bit but yet I was
[1:53:01] serious and I pray that these things is
[1:53:03] not taken as a conical way but just as a
